1
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:11,427
<i>For 4,000 years...</i>

2
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:20,562
<i>...villains and heroes,
and they don't do that here.</i>

3
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,897
<i>Here, you have Jews, Muslims, Christians,</i>

4
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,983
<i>all living shoulder to shoulder,
and it's messy.</i>

5
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:27,360
<i>And the challenge
for the State Department, for us...</i>

6
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:30,905
<i>Sounds like
I'm not gonna get a quick answer.</i>

7
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,199
<i>Mason's just playing the diplomat,
Congressman.</i>

8
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:35,910
<i>He's been here long enough
to explain this place in a minute.</i>

9
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,040
<i>Let's have
the shorter version. Give me the snapshot.</i>

10
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:44,586
<i>I don't know if I'd call it
a snapshot, but I tell people,</i>

11
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:48,715
"If you wanna understand Lebanon, think
of a boardinghouse without a landlord."

12
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:51,885
The only thing the tenants have in common

13
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:53,720
is their talent for betrayal.

14
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,559
So these people have been living together,
cheek by jowl, 20 centuries.

15
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:05,190
2,000 years of revenge, blood feuds,
vendetta, murder.

16
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:07,150
One night there's a storm.

17
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:10,320
Raining like hell.
There's a knock at the door.

18
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:12,488
Who is it? It's the Palestinians.

19
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:15,033
They want in.
They've been up and down the block.

20
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:17,716
They had doors slammed in their face.
They're cold. They're tired.

21
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:20,121
They want in and they want in now.

22
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,916
So the house is thrown into confusion.

23
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:26,294
Tenants arguing.
Some of 'em violently opposed.

24
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:29,214
Some think, "Let 'em in.
They'll be gone tomorrow."

25
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,715
Some think, "I let them in tonight,

26
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:32,592
then I'll have an ally against my enemy."

27
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:35,845
Some of 'em are terrified
if they keep the door shut.

28
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:38,556
So it isn't until after
the Palestinians move in

29
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:42,477
that the other people in the house
realize the tragedy of the situation.

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,188
That the Palestinians want nothing more

31
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,815
than to just burn down
the Israeli house next door.

32
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,947
Welcome to Beirut.

33
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,407
I told you he's good.

34
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,451
- Sure is.
- And so it goes.

35
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,329
Mr. Skiles.

36
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:03,623
<i>Ça va?</i> How are you?

37
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,253
You look beautiful. You look great.
Mason Skiles. How do you do?

38
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:10,171
We have not met. How do you do?

39
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:12,173
Nice to see you again. There he is.

40
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,676
<i>We know who
we don't wanna make deals with.</i>

41
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,345
The lessons of Vietnam have been learned.

42
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:18,596
And I think our president

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,849
has got his own things
on the domestic front to deal with.

44
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:26,980
But what we definitely don't wanna do is
establish any sort of permanent presence.

45
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:29,166
- Where are you from?
- Washington, DC.

46
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,901
Well, good for you. Welcome. Here we are.

47
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:33,695
The party is a delight.

48
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:34,778
Thank you!

49
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:36,901
We understand
that Beirut, specifically,

50
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:39,242
and Lebanon, more generally,

51
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:42,620
has enough people coming in
and trying to put fingerprints on it.

52
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:44,038
We don't wanna be one of those.

53
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:46,833
We just wanna make sure
everybody has a fair playing ground

54
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,877
to contribute
to a stable regional economy.

55
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,295
That's what I think.

56
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:55,341
The congressman
can certainly speak more to that.

57
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,176
Karim, this is some friends of ours.

58
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,679
This is Agnes and Joanne
from the United Kingdom.

59
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:01,973
Karim's been keeping everybody well-fed.

60
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,308
- Good job.
- Thank you.

61
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:05,977
How old is he?
He looks young.

62
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,311
He's about 13.

63
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:10,732
He's from one of the Palestinian
refugee camps in West Beirut.

64
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:14,277
He stuck around,
and he's become a part of the family,

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,486
which is very nice.

66
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,613
- My lovely wife, Nadia.
- Nice to meet you.

67
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:20,742
- You know the congressman.
- Are you enjoying Beirut?

68
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,703
- We've been having a very nice time.
- Yeah. Yes.

69
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:27,248
I find it's a beautiful place,
full of beautiful people.

70
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:28,458
Yes.

71
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,668
One beautiful person in particular.

72
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:35,506
As a diplomat in the Middle East,
you have to think on your feet.

73
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,009
And the more you do it,
the better you get at it.

74
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:40,219
When you talk about making deals,

75
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,305
the most important thing
is to keep talking.

76
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:45,308
As soon as the talking stops,
the fighting starts.

77
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:48,269
You need to come in
from a diplomatic standpoint

78
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,856
and explain to everybody involved,
"This is what we have to work with.

79
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,692
These are the pieces
on the game board right now."

80
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:57,779
Thank you for being here.
I'm gonna leave you in very capable hands.

81
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,197
I've gotta say hi to somebody.

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,782
Thanks so much. Good to see you.

83
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,659
Alice. Alice, all alone.

84
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,913
I heard you had congressmen.

85
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:08,748
You know how that drives me wild.

86
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,708
Where is Cal? I could use a hand.

87
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,472
He's coming. Just something at the office.

88
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,128
Everyone behaving themselves?

89
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:16,839
It's early.

90
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:18,424
Come on. Let's get you a drink.

91
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,385
- Hungry?
- Famished.

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,620
Hurry up, girls!

93
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:23,763
It's dinner time!

94
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,265
Mmm-mmm. Mmm.

95
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:27,934
- How we doing?
- Good.

96
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,186
Christians in one corner,
Muslims in the other

97
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,562
and Jack Daniel's in between.

98
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,356
Dinner's close. Everyone here?

99
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,067
Cal's late, but Alice said
we should start without him.

100
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,152
How are you, sweetie?

101
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:39,320
My next life?

102
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,948
- In your next life, you marry a carpenter.
- Mmm.

103
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:53,418
Where you been hiding?

104
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,670
The drivers out back,
they took everything.

105
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,338
The drivers clean you out?

106
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,507
They live to eat.

107
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,151
There you go.

108
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:02,927
Get you reloaded
and back out there.

109
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:21,571
<i>Pardon. Pardon.</i>

110
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:23,489
- Hey. How are ya?
- Hey, sweetie.

111
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:24,532
Have you seen Mason?

112
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:25,533
You look tense.

113
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:28,411
No, no. Just wanna talk
to Mason for a second.

114
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,579
What's wrong?

115
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:31,080
Nothing. I just...

116
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:34,917
Hello, Karim. Look at you.
Don't you look elegant.

117
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:38,337
- Don't you think so, Cal?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very elegant.

118
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,757
I understand congratulations are in order.

119
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,801
Nadia told me
you did really well on your exams.

120
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:44,927
She helped a lot.

121
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,388
But she's not the one
who took the test, is she?

122
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,515
You heard about this, right?

123
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,560
Yeah. Very impressive.
Excuse me, I'm just gonna...

124
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:03,237
Hey! There you are.
I was having a nightmare.

125
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,364
I was gonna have to babysit
these yahoos by myself.

126
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,450
- We need to talk.
- You need a drink.

127
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,620
Too much mingling with congressmen
will make you lose faith in democracy.

128
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,079
Indeed. We need to talk.

129
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,627
Mas, we've been through
a lot together. Right?

130
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:21,297
And somehow we've managed
to steer around the icebergs.

131
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,423
No, thank you.

132
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,384
Cal, spit it out. We have 25 people
out there waiting for dinner.

133
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,679
I've never come to you
with anything operational.

134
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:31,933
- We've always been clean.
- What the fuck are we talking about?

135
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:34,852
Karim.

136
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,772
It's about Karim.
They want him for questioning.

137
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,483
- Who wants him?
- Everybody.

138
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:45,279
- He's got a brother. Did you know that?
- What? No, he's got no one.

139
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:47,365
Why do you think Nadia took him in?

140
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:50,326
Rafid Abu Rajal.
They were separated in '68.

141
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,953
Karim came here to Beirut.

142
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,830
Rafid went to prison
for two years in Jordan.

143
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:55,914
Hold on.

144
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,876
Where's this going?

145
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,628
Munich.

146
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:05,049
The brother left a rental car
outside the Olympic Village.

147
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:10,388
They've got prints. They've got a witness.
They got this, Mas.

148
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:15,476
That's Karim and his brother
six months ago here in Beirut.

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,644
They who?

150
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:19,313
There's an operations supervisor
at the bottom of the driveway.

151
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:20,481
They want him now.

152
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,316
They who? Mossad?

153
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,694
I can help you. I can't make this go away.

154
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:25,778
So it is Mossad.

155
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:28,698
- Israel just drops a dime...
- Your people are all over this.

156
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:29,782
This is bullshit.

157
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:33,828
The State Department froze
your security access two hours ago. Okay?

158
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:37,582
Someone talked. It leaked.
It's gotta be now. It's not safe.

159
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,584
Cal, it's Karim for fuck's sake.

160
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,961
You've got the kid brother
of Global Enemy Number One

161
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,879
serving canapes to congressmen.

162
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:45,683
What are you gonna do?
Drag him out of here?

163
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:49,927
You think Nadia's gonna go for that?
She just filed papers for his sponsorship.

164
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:52,763
We just got him a student visa,
for chrissakes.

165
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,475
He's part of the family, Cal.

166
00:08:58,394 --> 00:08:59,437
Not my call.

167
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:06,736
You go tell your boss that I'll be
down to talk to him in five minutes.

168
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:14,785
<i>Karim, you be honest with me.</i>

169
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,830
If you lie to me, if you hang me up,
I cannot help you.

170
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:20,958
Your brother.

171
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:25,087
Is he dead?

172
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,301
- Is he dead?
- When is the last time you saw him?

173
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:31,802
Is he dead? Is Rafid dead?

174
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:33,596
He's not dead. Okay?

175
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,724
I need you to answer my question.
When did you see him last?

176
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:37,725
Months... Six months.

177
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:38,726
Six months where?

178
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,061
He comes to me.

179
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:41,729
He comes to you where?

180
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:43,898
I turn around and he's there...

181
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:44,982
on the street.

182
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,276
On the street.
He's here? In Beirut?

183
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,444
No! In Spain.

184
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:49,654
He lives in Spain now.

185
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,030
He cooks to make a restaurant.

186
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:52,698
Why would you lie to me about this?

187
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:53,982
Why are you angry?

188
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:58,329
Okay. I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at you. Okay?

189
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:01,040
I just need you
to tell me the truth. Okay?

190
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,667
His passport...

191
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,712
He took a Spain passport.

192
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:07,963
A new name.

193
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,257
He says no one can know.

194
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:12,259
If I tell anyone, he loses everything!

195
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:13,761
I promised him!

196
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,097
What's going on out here?

197
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,394
Go. Now. Go to the kitchen. Wait there.

198
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:22,937
What did he do?

199
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:26,232
I don't know. Nothing, maybe.
I don't know.

200
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:27,358
I need to handle this.

201
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:30,277
Go back inside,
make sure dinner gets out in time, okay?

202
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,570
I'll be back in a few minutes.

203
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,154
This is bad, isn't it?

204
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,324
It's nothing that can't be fixed.
All right?

205
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,204
Karim.

206
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,250
Are you okay?

207
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,418
What is it?

208
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:46,793
Huh?

209
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,421
What's wrong?

210
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:53,467
I promise
I will have him there. I guarantee it.

211
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,010
First thing tomorrow at the Embassy.

212
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:57,138
- I'm offering a compromise.
- I'm sorry.

213
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,014
I don't have the authority to negotiate.

214
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,476
That's a tough spot to be in. I know.

215
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,728
Been in that spot many times.

216
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:05,730
There's no reason
why this can't run smoothly.

217
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:07,648
I just don't see that happening.

218
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,942
- Does he know the situation here?
- I've explained it.

219
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:13,404
Mr. Riley is not here this evening
in a supervisory capacity.

220
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:15,740
We thought he might be able
to get the man out quietly.

221
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:16,823
"Man"?

222
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,909
This is a 13-year-old boy
we're talking about.

223
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:20,661
This child is harmless.

224
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,414
This is not an analysis assignment.

225
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:27,251
If you can't help me find
a creative solution to my problem,

226
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:30,337
then I'm gonna ask you
to telephone someone who can.

227
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,882
We've lost that as an option.

228
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:36,260
Then I suggest you retrace your steps
and figure out where...

229
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:40,014
Jesus! Get out...

230
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:41,557
Wait! Mas!

231
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,226
Mason! Hold it.

232
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:50,900
Watch out! Watch out!

233
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,361
Mason! Nadia!

234
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,529
Karim!

235
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:57,615
Nadia!

236
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:59,116
Karim!

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Nadia!

238
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,161
Move!

239
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:05,039
Get him out!

240
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:06,665
Help me, Mason!

241
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:10,544
Mason!

242
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:12,212
No!

243
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,715
No! Please!

244
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:15,799
Take me!

245
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,219
Leave her!

246
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,305
Drop your weapon!

247
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:24,475
Come here, Karim!

248
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,936
- No!
- Mason!

249
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,398
Karim.

250
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:35,236
Drop your weapon!
Or I kill her.

251
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:42,368
Please, no!

252
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:47,665
Please!

253
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:58,801
Go! Go!

254
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:08,644
No, baby. No, baby. Come on.
Stay here with me.

255
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:35,568
<i>Don't leave home
without that raincoat.</i>

256
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:37,298
<i>You are going to need it.</i>

257
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:40,050
<i>Showers will continue in the Boston area
throughout the evening,</i>

258
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:42,386
<i>tapering off just after rush hour.</i>

259
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:45,472
<i>And that's your traffic and weather
on WCPN.</i>

260
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:48,183
<i>It's 7:15. I'm Jane Emerson.</i>

261
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:51,854
<i>Coming up in the next half hour,
Jerry Torbin discusses the future...</i>

262
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:57,443
Hey, buddy!

263
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:00,821
You all right in there?

264
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,116
Yes... Yes, sir!

265
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:08,203
Well, you don't sound so sure.
Coming or going?

266
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:11,915
No, I'm here. I'm a guest
at the hotel. I was just heading in.

267
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,920
All right. Try sleeping inside.

268
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:01,340
<i>All right, issue number five,
pension attrition ratio.</i>

269
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:03,592
<i>We worked our way to common ground here.</i>

270
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:07,596
<i>Jerry's gonna accept the National Formula
and the Union has decided to waive</i>

271
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,474
<i>their "most favored nations" clause.
Great.</i>

272
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:13,310
<i>Number six, ICC indemnity bonding.</i>

273
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:15,771
Feels like another solid compromise here.

274
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:19,149
We'll cross-collateralize the premiums
with the safety bonuses.

275
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:25,364
So, we have fewer accidents, fewer claims.
We have a better package. Everybody wins.

276
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:26,699
All right, guys?

277
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:30,995
That is six issues
we've taken off the table.

278
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,955
It's important now to take a look back

279
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:34,456
and realize how far we've come.

280
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,833
Six of ten.

281
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,084
Of nine.

282
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,460
You see?

283
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:41,463
You're back with the overtime?
Again with this?

284
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:43,090
It's never going on the table.

285
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,884
Both sides have to show
more cards here. All right?

286
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:47,970
The numbers will tell us
which way we're gonna go.

287
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:49,888
I'm getting raped here, Mason.

288
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,225
- Prove it. Open your books!
- Open your fucking ears. I'm done.

289
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:55,269
I'm going back to the office
and starting over.

290
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:57,021
What do you mean by "starting over"?

291
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,564
I'm going back to my original offer.

292
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:00,941
- Is that a threat?
- No. Here's a threat.

293
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,861
I'm gonna start answering my phone,
'cause it's ringing off the hook

294
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:07,489
with guys who would kill to work
for what I paid you thieves 20 years ago.

295
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:09,453
You don't got the balls
to lock us out!

296
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,285
- Let's take a break.
- Try me.

297
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:13,454
I can have a strike vote
in 15 minutes.

298
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:14,579
Bring it on!

299
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:16,248
Let's see this strike!

300
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,424
Fuck you, you piece of fuckin'...
Do you know what? Kiss my fuckin' fat ass!

301
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:27,176
That went well.

302
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,888
They'll cool off.
The deal speaks for itself.

303
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,017
Let them sit with it a bit,
let the downside ring in their ears.

304
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,977
In a couple of days, they'll be back.

305
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,938
Where do we stand
with the supermarket thing in Providence?

306
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:43,192
They took a local guy. A lawyer.

307
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:45,136
I was gonna tell you this morning,

308
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:47,154
but it seemed like
you had a lot on your plate.

309
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,364
Can I buy you a drink at Foley's?

310
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,325
I've been offered a job.

311
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:53,994
It's New York.

312
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,706
We're still haggling
over the numbers, but...

313
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,294
That's not why I want to wrap things up.
I'm not bailing on you.

314
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,006
You need a rest, Mas.

315
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:08,509
Like, for real.

316
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:12,221
Get some sun. Walk around. Take a break.

317
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,016
You're gonna do great in New York, Ernie.

318
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,227
You'll be fine.

319
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:38,622
Colonel Ruzak.

320
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:45,294
...sanctions.

321
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:50,175
It's confirmed. They found the car.

322
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:56,306
- Pack your bag.
- It's in my office, sir.

323
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:10,362
Mason?

324
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:12,573
Mason Skiles?

325
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,286
You might not remember me. Ray Sullivan?

326
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:19,078
Sure.

327
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:22,541
You arbitrated a barter for us
a couple years back.

328
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:25,169
A fiber optics project down in Needham?

329
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:29,214
Sully. Of course. Of course.

330
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,383
- How are you? I'm sorry.
- No. Relax.

331
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:33,719
Happens to me ten times a day.
Who can keep track?

332
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,348
Yeah. We're just here
negotiating labor settlements.

333
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:42,519
Just killing time
while both sides cool down a little bit.

334
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:46,565
I know. I spoke to your partner.
He told me you might be here.

335
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,652
I got a wake-up call this morning.
Kind of a fire alarm.

336
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:54,823
Friends in Washington. Old friends.
Well, mutual friends.

337
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,911
They know I'm in the area
and they asked me to talk to you.

338
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:02,247
American University in Beirut.

339
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:05,334
I guess they had someone lined up
to give a lecture later this week,

340
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,627
and he canceled on them.

341
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:10,088
"Cross-Cultural Arbitration"
was the topic.

342
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:13,217
So, my friends, your credentials,
your being an alumni and all,

343
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,801
they were hoping you might fill in.

344
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:17,386
There's a check.

345
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,934
$6,500 and a first-class ticket.

346
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:25,812
I wouldn't go back to Beirut
if it was the last place on earth.

347
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,607
Flight leaves Logan at 8:45 tonight.

348
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,529
It sounds like you got about six hours
to find somebody else.

349
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:37,282
I was told that's not an option.

350
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:40,410
Look, I have no idea
what's happening here.

351
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:44,122
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
for both of us if I did.

352
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,876
But I was told to tell you that

353
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,004
time is extremely tight

354
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,885
and the agency would be deeply grateful
for your cooperation.

355
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:59,680
It's a serious request. They know that.

356
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:03,433
Tell 'em I don't have a passport.

357
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,435
They put one in with the ticket.

358
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,944
Great seeing you, Ray.

359
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:17,781
Do me a favor, will ya?

360
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,994
You miss the flight, this never happened.

361
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:42,337
<i>This is the last message I'm leaving,</i>

362
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:43,682
<i>because this is bullshit.</i>

363
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:48,353
<i>Dennis called a strike about an hour ago.
Maybe you know that.</i>

364
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:53,942
<i>I'm in New York. Pam has my keys.
I don't know what else to say.</i>

365
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:56,403
<i>You wanna talk, you know where to find me.</i>

366
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,502
<i>Mason Francis Skiles.</i>

367
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,296
<i>45 years old.</i>

368
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:17,299
<i>Postgrad at Oxford
in Arabic and Mideast studies.</i>

369
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:21,136
<i>He comes here in 1962
on a teaching fellowship.</i>

370
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,683
<i>He's recruited Foreign Service in '63
for immediate posting to Cairo.</i>

371
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,770
<i>Then Damascus, '65, Tel Aviv '68.</i>

372
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:32,773
<i>1969, he's reassigned to DC</i>

373
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,567
<i>as assistant undersecretary
for Mideast Affairs.</i>

374
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:40,447
<i>He marries. He's published.
He's widely quoted.</i>

375
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:43,075
<i>Kissinger takes a shine to him,</i>

376
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:45,452
<i>throws him a working group
at the Paris peace talks.</i>

377
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,623
And in '71 he jumps the line.
He comes back to Beirut,

378
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:52,334
where he was appointed
deputy chief of mission here.

379
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:56,380
And his wife... I guess Don
ran that by you on the ride in.

380
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:58,715
The incident at Skiles' house in '72?

381
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,426
His wife and the Abu Rajal brothers?

382
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,053
I can read, Ms. Crowder.

383
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:05,764
What I need to know is
where he stands now.

384
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:10,894
<i>Well, he left Beirut in '73
before the civil war kicked in.</i>

385
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:14,439
<i>He was the senior trade negotiator
for the Boston Merchandising Council,</i>

386
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:16,733
<i>and then he left there three years ago
to go private.</i>

387
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:20,028
<i>And now he just has
this small two-man firm.</i>

388
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:21,613
Mostly local labor issues.

389
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:26,993
So, from Kissinger to the crapper.

390
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,913
<i>Mm-hmm.
He has a drinking problem.</i>

391
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:31,873
<i>Christ. How bad?</i>

392
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,750
<i>They had to pour him
on to the plane.</i>

393
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:38,672
Like we've got time for this nonsense.
Talk to me, Don.

394
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:40,715
He's damaged goods.

395
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:43,427
Front-runner who stumbled.

396
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,096
But he's manageable.

397
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:50,392
Frank? You knew him when.

398
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:54,271
Don't play cards with him, Gary.

399
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:13,623
Take it easy.

400
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:23,632
Mr. Skiles!

401
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:25,635
Mr. Skiles!

402
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:33,435
Bernard Teppler. American University.
Absolute pleasure to have you here.

403
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:35,103
Let me take...

404
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:43,778
Welcome to Beirut.

405
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,781
We're thrilled to have you here.
Let me take that for you.

406
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:52,454
I'll be your liaison
with the university.

407
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:53,997
Get you where you need to get.

408
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,709
Beirut's changed quite a bit
in the past ten years.

409
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:59,628
You missed quite the civil war.

410
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:03,131
My itinerary says I'm staying
at the L'Admiral Hotel.

411
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:05,509
Yes, indeed.
We've booked you the deluxe suite.

412
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:08,595
On the shelling side, I'm afraid.
Beachside was full.

413
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,519
Why aren't we taking Rue du Nabil?
It's faster.

414
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:13,808
Rue du Nabil's not good today.

415
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:16,603
Big car bomb last night.
Many people killed.

416
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,104
Who lit that fuse?

417
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:21,233
Well, it's Beirut,
Mr. Skiles. Depends who you ask.

418
00:24:21,816 --> 00:24:25,278
PLO says it's Amal militia.
Amal militia says it's Christian militia.

419
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:28,698
Christian militia says it's the Druze.
Druze says it's the Syrian Army.

420
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:30,659
Listen to the radio from Damascus,

421
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:33,828
it's the Israelis making excuses
to come across the border.

422
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,539
Ask Israel...
Ah, for them it's always the PLO.

423
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:40,210
Not the PLO. My wife says
it was <i>Gamaeet El Cheea.</i>

424
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:41,919
What do you say?

425
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:44,089
I say we skip Rue du Nabil.

426
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:50,220
They're checking papers, sir.

427
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:52,764
Oh, fuck it.
I'm afraid I'll need your passport.

428
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:56,142
Nothing to worry about.
PLO run a decent checkpoint.

429
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:05,360
- Passport.
- Hold on.

430
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:07,279
Welcome to the Green Line.

431
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:09,906
This road divides
East and West Beirut now.

432
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:12,951
One of the civil war's
charming new landmarks.

433
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,246
Muslims to the West.
Christians to the East.

434
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,499
Not much room for the rest of us,
but there you have it.

435
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:21,835
Thank you! Thank you so much.

436
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,259
Shit.

437
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:38,495
<i>%... till it hurts %</i>

438
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:44,000
<i>% I know you hurt, too
But what else can we do %</i>

439
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:47,712
<i>% Tormented and torn apart %</i>

440
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:52,926
<i>% I wish I could carry your smile
In my heart... %</i>

441
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,887
<i>Monsieur. S'il vous plait?</i>

442
00:26:57,806 --> 00:27:01,643
<i>% It would make me believe
What tomorrow could bring %</i>

443
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:04,604
<i>% When today doesn't really know %</i>

444
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:08,566
<i>% Doesn't really know %</i>

445
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,277
<i>% I'm all out of love... %</i>

446
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:16,199
Mr. Skiles? Mr. Skiles?
Hi. I'm Sandy Crowder.

447
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:19,411
I'm the deputy cultural attaché
at the Embassy.

448
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:20,995
So nice to meet you.

449
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:23,707
What a surprise.

450
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,375
I help out at the university sometimes.

451
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,502
They told me you were here
for the lectures.

452
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,256
- I know you just got in...
- Yeah. No, I just... Please. Please.

453
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:33,174
No, I left my car out front.

454
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:35,343
Perhaps you'd like to get out
of the hotel?

455
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:39,222
Oh. You know what?

456
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:42,392
That's funny. I was just thinking
I could use a tour guide.

457
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:43,726
- Really?
- No.

458
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:45,979
So why don't we stand here and pretend

459
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:49,733
while you tell me what kind of trouble
I've gotten myself into.

460
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:53,778
The ambassador's hosting
a recital this evening,

461
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:55,613
and I was thinking of stopping in.

462
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:59,701
You're just gonna keep smiling at me
no matter what I say, right?

463
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:02,704
Why don't I meet you out front?

464
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:29,439
Good God. Mason.

465
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:31,065
Ambassador Whalen.

466
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,985
It's shocking, I'm sure.

467
00:28:35,236 --> 00:28:36,321
Good seeing you, Frank.

468
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:39,699
I seriously doubt that,
but I appreciate the effort.

469
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,368
Congratulations on all this.

470
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:44,287
Now I know you're fucking with me.

471
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:47,624
Why don't you go and find Don?
We'll be right up.

472
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,919
- Uh, flight good?
- Good enough.

473
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:52,837
You get a look around?

474
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:55,507
- Yeah. What's left of it.
- Breaks your heart?

475
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,510
I tell you, Mason.
You missed one hell of a fight.

476
00:28:58,593 --> 00:29:01,346
PLO started tossing bombs.
Government pushed back.

477
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:02,680
Israel got involved.

478
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:06,017
And what did we get? 50,000 dead.

479
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:09,562
City carved up like a goddamn pizza.

480
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:13,149
And the PLO, they're still here,
hoping the cease-fire holds.

481
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:16,194
'Cause now we've got Israel
down the road licking their chops,

482
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:20,698
looking for an excuse to drive up
and show us what great weapons we got 'em.

483
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:23,910
- Mason Skiles, uh, Colonel Gary Ruzak.
- Nice to see you.

484
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:26,454
- National Security Council.
- How you doing?

485
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:31,042
- Um, thirsty?
- Sure. Uh, bourbon. Neat.

486
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,003
Before we get started,

487
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:37,298
I want you to know we're all
keenly aware of what you've done.

488
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:39,675
And what is that?

489
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:44,180
Coming out here. No notice. No info.
It's been duly noted.

490
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:50,687
I think you know Don Gaines,
our chief political officer here.

491
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,770
Been a while.

492
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:53,022
Long time.

493
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,483
Here you go. Have a seat.

494
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,575
Okay.

495
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:09,539
Wow. Two spies, the White House
and an ambassador.

496
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:14,210
Maybe one of you can actually tell me
what I'm doing here.

497
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,214
Have you talked to anybody
in the area recently?

498
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:20,338
- No.
- You had a lot of friends here.

499
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:22,802
- You must keep in touch with some?
- No.

500
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,679
A phone call? Christmas card?

501
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:27,891
- Where we going with this?
- It's a simple question.

502
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:31,019
Who's in charge here?

503
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,812
We all serve the president.

504
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:35,481
Unless he's the next one
to pop through that door,

505
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:38,109
why don't you step up
and tell me what the fuck's going on.

506
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,159
Three nights ago, an American
was pulled off the street in West Beirut.

507
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:48,703
The next morning, we got a communiqué

508
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:51,664
from a group calling itself
the Militia of Islamic Liberation.

509
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:54,417
Very clean. No rhetoric.

510
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:56,753
They have the guy, they wanna talk.

511
00:30:58,004 --> 00:30:59,422
They want you to broker the deal.

512
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:03,426
They asked for you specifically.

513
00:31:04,135 --> 00:31:05,136
Who would do that?

514
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,596
We know who it's not.

515
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,973
It's not mainstream PLO.

516
00:31:09,057 --> 00:31:11,017
- That's a minority opinion.
- Come on.

517
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,103
The last thing they want is Israeli tanks
rolling across the border.

518
00:31:14,187 --> 00:31:15,772
They won't risk something like this.

519
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:19,484
Right now, we're not ruling out anyone.
Everything is in play.

520
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:23,029
What is it you want me to do?

521
00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:27,241
You're an experienced negotiator.
Negotiate.

522
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:31,245
I'm here because some lunatic
pulled my name out of a hat.

523
00:31:32,163 --> 00:31:34,540
Your kidnappers clearly wanna make a deal.

524
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:37,919
They got back fast. They're responsive.
They're specific.

525
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:39,712
You have something that they want.

526
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:41,839
Call their bluff. Tell them I'm out.

527
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:44,217
Let the downside of that
ring in their ears for a while.

528
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:47,845
If they bite, great.
You have your first concession.

529
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:53,059
Honestly, I'm a little surprised.
I thought I'd see Cal here tonight.

530
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:57,480
Cal Riley?

531
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,316
Cal's the hostage.

532
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:07,240
You guys were pretty close.

533
00:32:07,323 --> 00:32:09,158
When's the last time you talked to him?

534
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:11,995
Jesus. Uh...

535
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,331
Ten years ago? I...

536
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:18,376
Radio silence? Nothing?

537
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:20,878
Yeah, no. Yeah.

538
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:23,006
We believe Cal requested you.

539
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:24,090
Based on what?

540
00:32:24,173 --> 00:32:25,633
Nothing specific, but...

541
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:27,010
No, no, no, no, no...

542
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,304
No, I don't see that happening.

543
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:31,388
Cal's my CO.

544
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:34,684
We run half the agency's
Mideast operation off this desk.

545
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,936
Do you understand what that means?

546
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:39,731
Yeah. You're afraid he'll talk.

547
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:40,648
Afraid?

548
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:43,151
He's been here 13 years.
The guy's a walking playbook.

549
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:46,154
- At the moment nothing's blown.
- That we know of.

550
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:49,907
This goes bad, we don't even know
where to begin wrapping up.

551
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:52,201
We're playing the waiting game.
It's their move.

552
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:56,122
So, the question I need answered
from you right now is...

553
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:01,753
can we count on you to play along
until we get our feet on the ground?

554
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:07,216
So, here's our story.
We never mention Cal.

555
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,927
He's on assignment,
and nobody needs to know.

556
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:13,639
Ruzak doesn't arrive in Beirut
till tomorrow, so you've never met him.

557
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:15,016
We brought you here tonight

558
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:17,685
because we wanted to find out
what you're doing in town.

559
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:19,687
This isn't really my thing,
Gaines.

560
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:21,898
Sure it is. It's Texas Hold 'em.

561
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:25,735
Two cards down,
and everything else is on the table.

562
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:28,279
Just play the reality.

563
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:34,577
You're a confused 40-year-old widower
in the middle of a long winter.

564
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:36,662
You're pretending to give a lecture,

565
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:41,042
but the truth is you don't really know
what you're doing or why you came.

566
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,126
Reality.

567
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,672
Your name appears out of nowhere,
and we get real nervous. Reality.

568
00:33:47,256 --> 00:33:52,220
We roll you up for a look,
and you resent our interest. Reality.

569
00:33:52,804 --> 00:33:54,347
So, I'm leaving here pissed off?

570
00:33:54,972 --> 00:33:56,432
Works for me.

571
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:58,142
What about Ms. Crowder?

572
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:01,020
Well, it's a widely held belief

573
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:04,857
that dangling a skirt in front
of a jet-lagged American man of your age

574
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,442
is a high percentage play.

575
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:09,946
We done here?

576
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:13,616
You suddenly became really important.

577
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,201
Is that a mistake?

578
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:19,831
I don't know. Reality.

579
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,337
Gaines was just testing you.

580
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,589
Everyone's under a lot of pressure.

581
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:32,552
- Isn't that what you're after?
- What's that supposed to mean?

582
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:35,054
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for the action, right?

583
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:37,723
- You think I'm here for the thrills?
- I don't know.

584
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:40,726
No, you don't.

585
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,523
All right, fine. Enlighten me.
What's your story, Ms. Crowder?

586
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:49,110
I'm a skirt in a car driving
an irritated tourist back to his hotel.

587
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,285
Hey, can we take a quick detour?

588
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:00,787
To where?

589
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:03,791
I'll show you
where I used to live.

590
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:12,175
Wow.

591
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:24,187
The PLO had a transmitter up here.

592
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:28,608
Ten months ago, just before
the cease-fire, the Israelis took it out.

593
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:31,402
Must have been beautiful.

594
00:35:32,987 --> 00:35:33,987
It sure was.

595
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:37,824
In every way.

596
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:41,871
Ski in the morning, swim in the afternoon,
party all night?

597
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:43,331
No, not just that.

598
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:47,418
What we were doing
was what we wanted to do.

599
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,423
We were happy.

600
00:35:57,386 --> 00:35:59,305
I'm not sure how that turned into this.

601
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:02,516
I'm good.

602
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,561
Cal still with Alice?

603
00:36:06,854 --> 00:36:09,023
As far as I know, yeah.

604
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:12,818
- So, where is she?
- They have an apartment in Athens.

605
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:15,655
Alice moved there with the family
when the fighting started.

606
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:19,075
Cal stayed in Beirut.
It's impossible with kids here.

607
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:21,244
She knows I'm involved?

608
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,329
I'm not sure Gaines has told her yet.

609
00:36:23,913 --> 00:36:26,290
- We should head out.
- Hold on. Wait, wait.

610
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:29,043
What's your take on all this? Honestly.

611
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:33,214
Do you think they want to save Cal
or the information?

612
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:34,340
That's an ugly question.

613
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:35,925
You must have thought about it.

614
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:39,136
I'm too busy worrying whether you're
gonna come through for us or not.

615
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:44,100
Okay, fine. Just pretend for a minute
that I'm actually gonna do my job.

616
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:45,184
Who am I working for?

617
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:48,437
The White House? The State Department?
Don Gaines?

618
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:49,522
Make Cal your client.

619
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:54,235
Unless you blame him
for what happened here.

620
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,112
Is that what it says in my file?

621
00:36:57,154 --> 00:37:00,032
Listen, we all fucked up here.

622
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:02,785
Every one of us.

623
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:45,661
Shoot, double up.

624
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:43,677
It'll be transported to Paris.

625
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:47,890
I gotta tell you, Mas,

626
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:51,977
Alice has been pretty adamant
about going to the service.

627
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:56,482
I'll call you when I get there.

628
00:38:56,857 --> 00:39:00,945
If not now, then maybe we'll do
something later, stateside.

629
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:02,113
You can tell her that.

630
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:09,829
I keep thinking that I can take this.

631
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,499
- You're gonna be fine.
- Bullshit.

632
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:20,548
Sooner or later, you're gonna realize
that none of this was your fault.

633
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:24,093
Every time you say that, it cuts me.

634
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:26,345
Then I'll stop saying it.

635
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:33,477
- Take care of yourself, Cal.
- Hey, Mas...

636
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:35,437
Mason.

637
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:38,941
Mason!

638
00:39:47,992 --> 00:39:48,993
Mason.

639
00:39:51,537 --> 00:39:52,788
Mr. Skiles.

640
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,167
Mr. Skiles.

641
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:59,170
Mr. Skiles, good morning to you, sir.

642
00:40:11,932 --> 00:40:15,269
Bloody traffic!
Look, we're already late. She's waiting.

643
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:21,567
Look, uh, it's the blue Renault
across the street there.

644
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,152
Can you see it? Right there.

645
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:24,736
Off you pop.

646
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:27,155
All right.

647
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:31,368
Mr. Skiles!

648
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:32,620
Quick as you can.

649
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,217
No, no, no, no, no, no.

650
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,527
Are you fucking kidding?

651
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,653
What?

652
00:41:05,736 --> 00:41:07,655
I'm talking about the card game.

653
00:41:07,738 --> 00:41:09,406
I was told to act naturally.

654
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,116
Well, Bashir, your new friend...

655
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,117
The host?

656
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:14,328
He's the PLO Minister of Commerce.

657
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:18,082
I didn't get a revolutionary vibe off him.

658
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:19,845
He's a long way from the homeland.

659
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,794
He's got a house in Spain
and a condo in Sidon

660
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:23,462
and a Belgian hooker named Sandrine

661
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:26,090
he keeps in a luxury apartment
in Rue Hamra.

662
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:28,300
- How the hell does that work?
- The airlines.

663
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:30,010
He's pulling over a million a month,

664
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:33,597
'cause he's the guy who guarantees the PLO
won't blow your plane out of the sky.

665
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,684
You mind telling me
where you're taking me?

666
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:40,187
The kidnappers called at 6:00 a.m.
They know you're here. They want to meet.

667
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:45,442
Sent a comm signal out
about 20 minutes ago,

668
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,236
we just got called back.

669
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:49,780
We've got four million in cash
in the Embassy safe.

670
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:51,543
There's a Naval cruiser stationed offshore

671
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,242
with a SEAL team on standby.

672
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:56,704
We've got approval
to retarget the observation satellites.

673
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:58,455
We've got all the pieces in place.

674
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:01,125
We just gotta hope there's somebody
worth talking to. Let's go.

675
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:04,086
You all right?
You look a little jet-lagged.

676
00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:05,878
I'm fine.

677
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:11,677
All right, let's go.

678
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:17,242
It's the Syrian Air Force.

679
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:21,288
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing there.

680
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:23,916
Shit getting closer, though.

681
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:29,630
Hey! Don't move! Don't move!

682
00:43:29,713 --> 00:43:32,091
Don't move! No, no, no.

683
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:37,971
We send in four of ours.
We hold four of theirs.

684
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:40,391
We finish, we go back the way we came.

685
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:45,604
All right. We're playing by ear
from here on out, Mason.

686
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:47,439
Follow our lead, we'll be fine.

687
00:43:48,023 --> 00:43:50,109
Gaines does the talking. Understand?

688
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:53,946
- Just another pretty face.
- All right, let's go.

689
00:44:34,278 --> 00:44:35,279
Sit.

690
00:44:36,947 --> 00:44:38,157
We've been waiting.

691
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,660
He says they've been waiting.

692
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:02,806
How may we be sure
that this man is alive?

693
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,266
You will trust in my word.

694
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:05,601
Which one of you is Skiles?

695
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:08,228
Now he's asking who's Skiles?

696
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:10,105
Tell him this isn't much to go on.

697
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:12,941
We are concerned that the...

698
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:16,028
My question remains unanswered!

699
00:45:16,612 --> 00:45:18,030
I'm Skiles.

700
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,407
I am curious...

701
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:22,534
My friends are curious.

702
00:45:22,618 --> 00:45:26,205
How is it that I can help
where others cannot?

703
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:27,539
No, no, no, no!

704
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:29,249
I'm not here to answer questions.

705
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,127
I'm here to tell you what must happen.

706
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:34,546
- I ask the questions.
- Sir...

707
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,008
Demands can be thrown
through the Embassy window.

708
00:45:38,717 --> 00:45:39,927
We've come to hear your voice.

709
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,303
And to let you hear ours.

710
00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:42,930
My voice?

711
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:45,265
These men should speak!

712
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:47,476
This man saw his mother
and sister blown up

713
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:50,229
two days ago at Barjesh Kjehelem.

714
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,524
Do you know that sound?

715
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:57,861
The sound of American bombs
falling from Zionist planes.

716
00:45:57,945 --> 00:46:00,864
Perhaps you should ask him
what it is he needs!

717
00:46:00,948 --> 00:46:01,823
Sir!

718
00:46:01,907 --> 00:46:03,200
Enough!

719
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:06,370
So... Tell us. Tell us.

720
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,667
What is the price of our man's freedom?

721
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,750
The price?

722
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,338
Where do you think you are, the souk?

723
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:18,341
You think
we're selling you lipstick?

724
00:46:18,966 --> 00:46:21,802
Yes, Saiyid!
The market is now open for business.

725
00:46:21,885 --> 00:46:23,178
Come in! Come in!

726
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:31,645
- What have you done?
- Don't question me.

727
00:46:32,729 --> 00:46:34,523
Everything okay in there?

728
00:46:35,315 --> 00:46:36,635
Take him out of here.

729
00:46:42,155 --> 00:46:43,365
It's okay.

730
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,453
Everyone stay where they're at.

731
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:50,444
Everything is okay!

732
00:46:50,497 --> 00:46:53,292
Okay, we'll stand by. Okay.

733
00:46:58,213 --> 00:46:59,673
I apologize.

734
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,468
My friend was old.

735
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:07,639
He was confused by... anger.

736
00:47:09,558 --> 00:47:14,104
I know when we speak to America,
we need clarity.

737
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:18,817
We need to choose word carefully.

738
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,532
You agree, Mr. Skiles?

739
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,747
Have I changed so much?

740
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:34,958
What the hell is this?

741
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:37,252
You know this guy?

742
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:39,755
Yes, I do.

743
00:47:41,214 --> 00:47:42,341
Karim.

744
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:44,718
Karim Abu Rajal.

745
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:46,678
You look older.

746
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:47,929
So do you.

747
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:51,767
I apologize for the circumstance.

748
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,570
I'm afraid we don't have
a lot of time here.

749
00:47:53,644 --> 00:47:56,063
- You're apologizing a lot.
- Jesus Christ.

750
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:57,826
- What do you want?
- What the fuck?

751
00:47:57,898 --> 00:47:59,316
You're gonna let that man fuck us?

752
00:47:59,399 --> 00:48:00,400
My brother.

753
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:03,070
Rafid Abu Rajal.

754
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:05,489
He is known to you.

755
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:07,407
Yes.

756
00:48:07,491 --> 00:48:10,661
I will trade Cal Riley
for the return of my brother.

757
00:48:11,995 --> 00:48:13,747
What makes you think we have your brother?

758
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,124
Not you. Israel.

759
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:17,751
Why come to us?

760
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:20,128
Why go to the son
when the father is so close?

761
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:26,301
You're saying the Israelis have Abu Rajal
in custody and they're keeping it quiet?

762
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:28,261
I think we would know
something about that.

763
00:48:28,345 --> 00:48:31,306
He was with friend at the border
in the south. Now he's missing.

764
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,308
You understand my offer?

765
00:48:33,392 --> 00:48:35,644
Yes. Straight up, Cal for your brother.

766
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:37,854
I've explained my terms.

767
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:41,817
- Wait.
- Describe Cal's condition.

768
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:43,485
Alive.

769
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,048
- How do we contact you?
- I trade only with Mr. Skiles.

770
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:46,947
Why?

771
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,782
Because he doesn't trust you, either.

772
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:52,327
Hold on a minute.
What if they're not lying?

773
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:56,331
If they can't find your brother,
come up with an alternative.

774
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:57,666
Alternative?

775
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:01,586
This is alternative.

776
00:49:02,462 --> 00:49:05,090
A, they killed him
and haven't told us yet.

777
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:06,533
For chrissakes, it's Israel.

778
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:08,552
B, they killed him
and don't know it.

779
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:10,679
C, they have him and don't know it.

780
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:12,764
He's been picked up
but hasn't been ID'd yet.

781
00:49:12,848 --> 00:49:15,008
The guy they've been hunting
the last ten years?

782
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:17,102
- I don't think so.
- D, he's hiding.

783
00:49:17,185 --> 00:49:19,896
He's been driven so deep,
his own people don't know where he is.

784
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,609
E, F, G, they have him in Tel Aviv
in a cage with a little socket in his ear.

785
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:25,819
Does it even matter?

786
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:28,155
You think if they have him,
they'll just let him out,

787
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:30,157
so he can blow up
another bus full of Israelis?

788
00:49:30,615 --> 00:49:31,700
You got your checkbook.

789
00:49:31,783 --> 00:49:35,287
It's Abu Rajal. Are you kidding me?
He's Munich!

790
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,747
There's always a number.

791
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,039
Never happen.

792
00:49:38,123 --> 00:49:39,207
It's worth a meeting.

793
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:42,127
And say what? Tell them about Cal?
We do that and he's blown.

794
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,629
We don't say anything,
go in, drop a bomb, see what happens.

795
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:46,256
Come on, get me a meeting in Israel.

796
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:47,466
Wait a minute...

797
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,176
You know I can do things you can't.

798
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:51,803
I don't have to be here
when this blows up. I can play hard.

799
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:54,765
These are our friends.
You're over your fucking head.

800
00:49:54,848 --> 00:49:56,558
- Okay.
- You're over your head.

801
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:59,227
What's Cal's value on the open market?
That some big secret?

802
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:01,951
You think Karim is the only one
that knows he hit the jackpot here?

803
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:04,566
How long do you think
he holds that gang together?

804
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:07,444
How long before one of those guys
gets ambitious

805
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:10,030
or pissed off
or does something sloppy or stupid?

806
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:12,449
I'm sorry, right now your only problem

807
00:50:12,532 --> 00:50:14,659
is getting the Abu Rajal brothers
back together.

808
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:17,162
And whether Rafid blows up another bus

809
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:20,457
is something you'll need
to worry about later, after Cal is safe.

810
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,044
You don't have time to be polite,
and you cannot afford to be predictable.

811
00:50:25,212 --> 00:50:28,548
You need cards to play,
and you need them right now.

812
00:50:29,216 --> 00:50:31,384
<i>So, unless someone else has a better idea,</i>

813
00:50:31,468 --> 00:50:34,429
<i>I say we go rattle the Israelis
before they can stonewall us.</i>

814
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:39,726
<i>I'm sorry, this is a waste of time.</i>

815
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,521
Rafid Abu Rajal? Seriously?

816
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:45,774
- What's going on here, Gary?
- I don't...

817
00:50:45,857 --> 00:50:48,193
If you don't have him,
it doesn't really matter, does it?

818
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:53,406
I think it's safe to say that if we knew
where he was, he'd be dead.

819
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:56,535
And we're saying that he might be
worth more to us alive.

820
00:50:58,912 --> 00:51:00,831
- Why?
- We're not here to say why.

821
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:04,000
We're just here
to see if the market's open.

822
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:09,714
Is this about you looking
for the man who killed your wife?

823
00:51:13,593 --> 00:51:16,346
- Would that get the ball rolling?
- There's no ball.

824
00:51:18,014 --> 00:51:20,183
You came all the way here just for this?

825
00:51:20,267 --> 00:51:21,518
- No.
- Okay. Hold on.

826
00:51:21,601 --> 00:51:23,144
Hypothetically...

827
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:24,646
Just for fun...

828
00:51:25,856 --> 00:51:27,023
Let's say you did have him.

829
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,985
What would it take?
What's on your wish list?

830
00:51:30,944 --> 00:51:31,987
Sky is the limit.

831
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:35,615
I'm sorry, Gary.

832
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:39,578
Someday you're gonna have to tell me
what this was all about.

833
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:45,417
I must be out of my mind
for bringing you here.

834
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,334
Relax!

835
00:51:46,418 --> 00:51:48,461
I can't even think
of all the ways this is fucked.

836
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:49,880
They're coming back to us.

837
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:53,174
These are people
I have to deal with every day, Mason.

838
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:56,094
We're not done yet here, Gary.

839
00:51:56,177 --> 00:51:57,512
Are you drunk or delusional?

840
00:51:57,596 --> 00:51:59,639
We're in play. You need to be ready.

841
00:52:04,477 --> 00:52:05,937
- Back to the airport.
- Yes, sir.

842
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:08,773
The curiosity's driving your buddy crazy.

843
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:10,525
You are. You're delusional.

844
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:11,735
Okay. Put up or shut up.

845
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:13,361
I say they call before we take off.

846
00:52:13,445 --> 00:52:15,488
If I'm wrong, I'm off your back.

847
00:52:15,572 --> 00:52:19,534
I'm right, in the next meeting,
the one they throw me out of,

848
00:52:19,618 --> 00:52:21,703
you're gonna stick around
and close the deal.

849
00:52:21,786 --> 00:52:23,747
I'm begging you to shut the fuck up.

850
00:52:25,457 --> 00:52:27,375
- Mr. Ruzak?
- Yeah?

851
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,169
There's a call for you.

852
00:52:33,006 --> 00:52:34,591
<i>Munich Olympics.</i>

853
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,304
Madrid. 16 Israeli tourists.

854
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:46,436
A synagogue in Istanbul.
14 victims. Children.

855
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:53,109
El Al flight 305. 46 dead. Families.

856
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:57,155
All of this, Rafid Abu Rajal.

857
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:05,913
So how much?

858
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:09,709
We know what we're asking.
We don't know the price.

859
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:12,671
If we had him, we would never let him go.

860
00:53:13,797 --> 00:53:15,423
That's a tough opening.

861
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:16,633
Is this man deaf?

862
00:53:16,716 --> 00:53:20,720
- I think we're off the track.
- It's a simple question. How much?

863
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:21,805
We never said we had him.

864
00:53:21,888 --> 00:53:26,434
- Then what are we doing here?
- No! What the hell are you doing here?

865
00:53:27,018 --> 00:53:28,603
Wait for me.

866
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:30,438
Wait for me.

867
00:53:57,132 --> 00:53:59,175
- Hypothetically...
- They have him.

868
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:02,929
Eh. They won't say.
They're gonna take another look.

869
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:06,349
He might be "lost" in the system.

870
00:54:07,392 --> 00:54:11,312
I think they have him.
I think they have him.

871
00:54:11,396 --> 00:54:12,522
What do they want?

872
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:16,192
You mean other than to make sure
you're not involved?

873
00:54:16,776 --> 00:54:20,238
Syria has antiaircraft bunkers
all over the Bekaa Valley.

874
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:23,366
Half of them are decoys.
They want better satellite imaging.

875
00:54:24,117 --> 00:54:25,118
That's it?

876
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,955
Two dozen Syrian targets
they don't have eyes on?

877
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:32,876
Take my word, it's a major piece
of strategic intelligence.

878
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,420
Did you tell them it was Cal,
or did they already know?

879
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:42,218
Did you really think
they were gonna make a blind deal?

880
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:44,971
Of course I told them.

881
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:47,265
This isn't the New England
Chamber of Commerce.

882
00:54:47,974 --> 00:54:49,309
You've got us in there

883
00:54:49,392 --> 00:54:52,353
playing good cop, bad cop
with the World Heavyweight Champions.

884
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:57,192
Look, we got lucky, okay?
But that's the end of the flimflam.

885
00:54:57,275 --> 00:55:00,070
From here on out,
you're our spokesman to Karim.

886
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,155
That's it. End of story.

887
00:55:05,617 --> 00:55:09,287
Now, this is bullshit up and down!

888
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:13,583
Syrian bunkers, my ass.
Those are Russian-built installations.

889
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:14,946
We're running out of time.

890
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:17,837
- Are you kidding me?
- They just want the imaging!

891
00:55:18,421 --> 00:55:19,672
Here you go.

892
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:21,883
Thank you.

893
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:31,935
Don't say a word.

894
00:55:35,396 --> 00:55:38,316
<i>You're talking
about jeopardizing US-Soviet relations.</i>

895
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:41,611
<i>That's why
Washington's gonna be making decisions.</i>

896
00:55:41,694 --> 00:55:45,115
<i>We spoke with the minister, Frank.
He was very direct.</i>

897
00:55:45,198 --> 00:55:48,243
<i>They give us Abu Rajal,
we give them satellite pictures...</i>

898
00:55:48,326 --> 00:55:50,328
<i>Those pictures are the only thing</i>

899
00:55:50,411 --> 00:55:53,206
<i>keeping the Israelis
from crossing the border.</i>

900
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:54,332
<i>Little dramatic.</i>

901
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:56,084
You take away those rockets

902
00:55:56,167 --> 00:56:00,046
and the Israeli Air Force does
whatever they want to up here.

903
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,631
<i>You give them that intel,</i>

904
00:56:01,714 --> 00:56:05,093
<i>we might as well hand the PLO
their life preservers tonight.</i>

905
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,555
<i>- You think Riley's worth that?
- Come on, guys.</i>

906
00:56:08,638 --> 00:56:11,038
<i>- Are you serious?</i>
- Y <i>ou like this, don't you, Gary?</i>

907
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,059
<i>Two birds? One stone?</i>

908
00:56:13,643 --> 00:56:16,479
You've been trying to push
an Israeli invasion along for months.

909
00:56:16,563 --> 00:56:19,149
You might want to check with your boss.

910
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:22,193
- I'm not the Christmas help.
- I'll be calling the Secretary.

911
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:24,988
<i>- Do what you have to do.
- Count on it.</i>

912
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:28,867
See what you been missing around here?

913
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,870
We're putting a plan in place.

914
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:35,206
Well, we're in play. That's the good news.

915
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:36,833
Let's see what comes back.

916
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,461
Did you get a chance to tell him?

917
00:56:41,629 --> 00:56:45,258
Alice is in town.
She flew in from Athens this morning.

918
00:56:46,342 --> 00:56:47,677
<i>She's obviously upset.</i>

919
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,931
<i>She's gone back to their old apartment,
which is no longer a safe neighborhood.</i>

920
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:58,396
<i>We need to get her out of there.</i>

921
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,411
He's on his way.

922
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,014
Ma'am, Skiles is here.

923
00:57:40,939 --> 00:57:41,940
Alice.

924
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:01,918
If that's for me...

925
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:04,379
No?

926
00:58:06,756 --> 00:58:08,216
It's warm anyway.

927
00:58:10,677 --> 00:58:12,679
They've had the electricity off all day.

928
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:16,349
Don Gaines told me you were an alcoholic.

929
00:58:17,684 --> 00:58:19,143
Guess that makes sense.

930
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:21,980
God knows what he says about me.

931
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:29,737
I know it's a lot to take in right now.

932
00:58:31,197 --> 00:58:33,116
I know they want me out of here.

933
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,493
You've got the girls to think about.

934
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,831
You say that as if you know them.

935
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:45,920
The girls are fine.
They're living with my parents...

936
00:58:46,504 --> 00:58:49,424
in blissful ignorance of all things adult.

937
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,178
Do you think Cal's still alive?

938
00:58:56,055 --> 00:58:57,056
I do.

939
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:03,187
People seem very motivated.

940
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:05,356
How they seem? In Beirut?

941
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:09,661
Most of the people you're talking to
would love to see him disappear.

942
00:59:10,445 --> 00:59:11,654
People like who?

943
00:59:12,322 --> 00:59:14,532
Cal thought he'd earned the right
to have an opinion.

944
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:19,162
You'd think someone with so many secrets
would be able to keep their mouth shut.

945
00:59:20,038 --> 00:59:21,789
- About what?
- Seriously?

946
00:59:22,373 --> 00:59:23,958
Israel will fail here.

947
00:59:24,751 --> 00:59:27,920
They'll drown,
like everyone who came before them.

948
00:59:28,004 --> 00:59:30,173
Just don't dare say it out loud.

949
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:32,634
- Is that what he's done?
- Oh, for chrissake.

950
00:59:32,717 --> 00:59:35,428
Look, Alice, I'm doing everything I can.

951
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:37,597
- To do what?
- To save him.

952
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,224
Well, you've proven you can crush him.

953
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:43,144
Bringing him back to life
may be a little harder.

954
00:59:47,649 --> 00:59:49,108
Oh, God, this place.

955
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,569
Staying here...

956
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:55,156
All the things we might've done.

957
00:59:57,992 --> 00:59:59,786
We could've gone anywhere.

958
01:00:01,954 --> 01:00:04,207
You, know, I think really, in the end,

959
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:08,419
he's been waiting for you to come back
and tell him it's okay to leave.

960
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:11,172
And here you are.

961
01:00:12,548 --> 01:00:13,883
But it's too late.

962
01:00:15,426 --> 01:00:17,804
You can tell them I'm leaving tonight.

963
01:00:17,887 --> 01:00:19,472
And you owe me a favor.

964
01:00:20,598 --> 01:00:23,643
When you left Beirut, I packed your house.

965
01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:28,981
Dishes, papers, Nadia's clothes,
all of it...

966
01:00:29,774 --> 01:00:33,736
Cal doesn't make it out of here,
you pack this place up for me.

967
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,238
I think that's fair.

968
01:00:43,496 --> 01:00:44,789
She's ready to go.

969
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:48,793
- He's on his way down.
<i>- Copy.</i>

970
01:01:02,056 --> 01:01:03,474
<i>Monsieur</i> Skiles.

971
01:01:17,405 --> 01:01:18,531
Come, come!

972
01:01:18,614 --> 01:01:21,617
We don't have a lot of time.

973
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:27,623
He's on his way?

974
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:29,917
<i>Yeah.
He's coming to you.</i>

975
01:01:33,337 --> 01:01:34,547
Mason?

976
01:01:36,424 --> 01:01:37,425
Mason?

977
01:02:00,364 --> 01:02:02,408
He disappeared. Let's move.

978
01:02:04,994 --> 01:02:05,995
Slow down!

979
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,290
Get her out of there
right now.

980
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:11,792
Fuck.

981
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:18,424
Slow down.

982
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:22,929
Follow me!

983
01:02:32,188 --> 01:02:33,731
No, no further.

984
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:37,067
Stop!

985
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:39,904
Stop!

986
01:02:40,947 --> 01:02:42,156
Stop!

987
01:02:50,081 --> 01:02:51,082
No.

988
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,377
Get in!

989
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:16,607
You went to Israel.

990
01:03:16,691 --> 01:03:19,610
Yes, Karim, they said maybe they have him.

991
01:03:19,694 --> 01:03:21,571
- So, now we're waiting.
- What? Maybe?

992
01:03:21,654 --> 01:03:22,655
You wait for them?

993
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:24,479
Bullshit! You wait for nothing!

994
01:03:24,532 --> 01:03:26,993
- You... Shut up!
- We are trying. They know it's important.

995
01:03:28,286 --> 01:03:31,205
You have to tell them to make it work!

996
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:34,750
Karim, I got back two hours ago!
We are trying.

997
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:36,085
Find a stop.

998
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:38,008
- I need to see Cal.
- Impossible.

999
01:03:38,045 --> 01:03:40,047
I need to see Cal and speak to him.

1000
01:03:40,131 --> 01:03:41,215
Find Rafid first.

1001
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:43,551
- If I had your brother, I'd let you talk.
- Impossible.

1002
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:45,428
It's only impossible if he's dead.

1003
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:47,805
Get out.

1004
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:50,369
Are you kidding me?
I'm supposed to trust you now?

1005
01:03:50,683 --> 01:03:51,934
Get out!

1006
01:03:52,018 --> 01:03:53,644
You're the reason I'm here!

1007
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:57,315
I gave my life up to protect you!

1008
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:01,151
Get out!

1009
01:04:01,444 --> 01:04:05,364
Listen to me very closely
if you want to see your brother again.

1010
01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:08,284
I don't make a move until I talk to Cal.

1011
01:04:30,306 --> 01:04:31,557
We don't have him.

1012
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:34,643
What?

1013
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:36,270
- We looked.
- No.

1014
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:38,147
We don't have him.

1015
01:04:40,399 --> 01:04:43,653
- The wheels are in motion, Roni.
- Oh, we should worry?

1016
01:04:43,736 --> 01:04:46,822
You wait three days to tell us
Cal Riley is a hostage?

1017
01:04:46,906 --> 01:04:49,325
What if he talks?
We might have people in danger now.

1018
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:52,828
Without Abu Rajal,
this doesn't give me many options.

1019
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:56,123
- Work with what you have.
- And what do I have? Say it.

1020
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:58,542
You had the whole ride up
to think about it.

1021
01:04:58,626 --> 01:05:00,252
You know what I want, Gary.

1022
01:05:00,336 --> 01:05:01,545
Say it.

1023
01:05:03,714 --> 01:05:05,466
Make this the moment.

1024
01:05:05,716 --> 01:05:07,969
Make Riley the breaking point.

1025
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:14,100
"US Embassy staff grabbed off the streets,
kidnapped, killed.

1026
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:18,771
The monsters have taken over Lebanon.
Something needs to be done."

1027
01:05:19,355 --> 01:05:22,274
Give us the green light.
We could clear this place out in a month.

1028
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:25,778
Just burn Cal
and give Israel the keys to the city?

1029
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:27,071
We should worry for him?

1030
01:05:27,154 --> 01:05:31,158
- He's been a thorn in our side for years.
- Cal's network? His assets?

1031
01:05:31,701 --> 01:05:34,412
You think the agency's
just gonna throw all that away?

1032
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:36,455
If he's not back soon,
they won't have a choice.

1033
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:38,374
Oh, God.

1034
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:40,084
You've got lemons, Gary.

1035
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:41,836
Make some lemonade.

1036
01:05:55,016 --> 01:05:57,935
You have any idea how many people
we have looking for you?

1037
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:00,312
Obviously, not enough.

1038
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:04,942
This kid, the messenger, says what?
"Follow me"?

1039
01:06:05,026 --> 01:06:08,779
He gave me a note.
It had one word on it. "Karim."

1040
01:06:08,863 --> 01:06:10,703
I didn't have a lot of time
to make a decision.

1041
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:14,160
- No one shows up?
- No, the kid bails on me.

1042
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:16,412
I fall down, walk back here.

1043
01:06:16,495 --> 01:06:18,748
I didn't see anybody out there
looking for me.

1044
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:20,666
I'm not staying.

1045
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,960
Another one for me, please.

1046
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:28,786
Take off your belt.

1047
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:30,468
What?

1048
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:31,886
Under the table.

1049
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:35,014
I'm giving you a new belt.

1050
01:06:36,974 --> 01:06:38,059
A transmitter?

1051
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:41,062
I can't lose you again.

1052
01:06:46,108 --> 01:06:47,193
Now, do us both a favor.

1053
01:06:47,777 --> 01:06:51,030
You're speaking at the university
tomorrow, so make that your nightcap.

1054
01:06:51,614 --> 01:06:53,115
And get something to eat.

1055
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,626
<i>Merci.</i>

1056
01:07:15,096 --> 01:07:17,098
<i>We're five days
and counting, Gaines.</i>

1057
01:07:18,265 --> 01:07:21,310
How much longer can you wait
before you start pulling Cal's people?

1058
01:07:22,228 --> 01:07:24,355
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1059
01:07:24,939 --> 01:07:26,190
What if this is all bullshit,

1060
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:28,692
and they've been working Cal over
from the start?

1061
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:30,569
That's Mossad talking.

1062
01:07:30,653 --> 01:07:33,197
Fuck that, it's common sense.

1063
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,990
But I hate to say it, Gaines,

1064
01:07:35,074 --> 01:07:36,074
Cal talks...

1065
01:07:36,951 --> 01:07:39,870
you want to be waiting for bodies
to pile up on the Embassy sidewalk?

1066
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:43,874
Tel Aviv loves this, don't they?

1067
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:48,379
We're gonna lose every asset we've got.
They'll be the only game left in town.

1068
01:07:48,462 --> 01:07:49,922
It's a tough decision,

1069
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,217
but I need to know
you're thinking about it clearly.

1070
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:58,514
Just give me 12 more hours.

1071
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:01,684
Maybe we'll get lucky.

1072
01:08:04,728 --> 01:08:06,522
<i>What the hell are we gonna do with Skiles?</i>

1073
01:08:07,273 --> 01:08:09,650
<i>Do with him? He's a drunk.</i>

1074
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:12,695
<i>He's got the belt now,
so keep an eye on him.</i>

1075
01:08:14,697 --> 01:08:17,241
<i>He fucks anything up, well...</i>

1076
01:08:17,324 --> 01:08:19,160
it's always good to have someone to blame.

1077
01:08:22,955 --> 01:08:27,418
Thank you. Yes, and next question. You.

1078
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:31,046
With the striped shirt and the glasses.
And do speak up. Don't be shy.

1079
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,131
Mr. Skiles,

1080
01:08:32,214 --> 01:08:35,176
you worked on the Paris peace talks
when you were very young.

1081
01:08:35,259 --> 01:08:36,760
Was that your first negotiation?

1082
01:08:38,095 --> 01:08:39,471
Uh...

1083
01:08:39,555 --> 01:08:41,307
My first? No.

1084
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:44,476
No, not by a long shot. Uh...

1085
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,522
I was raised as an only child
in a very small home with two people

1086
01:08:48,606 --> 01:08:51,650
who basically hated each other
just enough to stay together.

1087
01:08:52,735 --> 01:08:56,822
So, I guess you could say I've been
mediating since before I was born.

1088
01:08:57,698 --> 01:09:01,911
So, to give you some kind of context,
when I was about nine years old,

1089
01:09:02,828 --> 01:09:04,830
<i>one night
my father came home</i>

1090
01:09:04,914 --> 01:09:06,314
<i>from one of his girlfriends' house.</i>

1091
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:09,668
<i>And my mother served him
for dinner that night</i>

1092
01:09:09,752 --> 01:09:12,213
<i>about a dozen of his best racing pigeons.</i>

1093
01:09:14,131 --> 01:09:15,507
It would be about ten more years

1094
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:18,093
before I heard the term
"Mutually Assured Destruction,"

1095
01:09:18,177 --> 01:09:22,348
but rest assured, I was very familiar
with it growing up in that...

1096
01:09:35,611 --> 01:09:38,405
- Go, go! Go!
- Look for channel 5!

1097
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:40,324
No, channel 6.

1098
01:09:40,407 --> 01:09:42,660
- Get me my beacon.
- Working on it.

1099
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,792
Let me help you, sir. Mr. Teppler.

1100
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,759
The pharmacy Jumblatt! Jumblatt!

1101
01:09:58,842 --> 01:09:59,760
What?

1102
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:02,429
Jumblatt near the Druze cemetery!

1103
01:10:02,513 --> 01:10:03,764
Pharmacy Jumblatt!

1104
01:10:03,847 --> 01:10:05,391
You leave now. Alone.

1105
01:10:05,474 --> 01:10:08,644
- You understand? You need to go now!
- Yes! Yes!

1106
01:10:10,187 --> 01:10:11,563
I need Crowder on the line now.

1107
01:10:11,647 --> 01:10:14,608
Crowder's in a van outside.
Pick it up. Line two.

1108
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:17,736
Sandy? What happened? Where's Skiles?

1109
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,238
I have no idea. Unknown.

1110
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:20,531
Where the hell's my beacon?

1111
01:10:20,614 --> 01:10:22,616
I can't get a fix. We have to move.

1112
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:30,874
Hey, where is he?

1113
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:32,668
He's gone. He's gone.

1114
01:10:33,502 --> 01:10:36,672
- He disappeared.
- We're going to leave.

1115
01:10:37,339 --> 01:10:38,579
We're on the move.

1116
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:40,050
Do not lose him!

1117
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:43,637
Shit! Skiles is MIA.

1118
01:10:43,721 --> 01:10:46,348
- Missing or taken?
- I don't know, but he's got the belt.

1119
01:10:46,432 --> 01:10:49,977
- I want that signal relayed in here!
- Yes, sir. I'm on it.

1120
01:10:50,936 --> 01:10:52,980
- Let's get a flag up for the Ops team.
- Got it.

1121
01:10:53,063 --> 01:10:56,066
Ethan, get me a line
to the SEALs Ops team.

1122
01:11:19,048 --> 01:11:20,674
It's not safe here, friend.

1123
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:23,886
Thank you.

1124
01:12:39,962 --> 01:12:41,362
Stop where you are.

1125
01:12:43,257 --> 01:12:44,258
Don't move.

1126
01:12:51,348 --> 01:12:52,391
Put this on.

1127
01:13:00,858 --> 01:13:04,278
Okay, 300 yards.
Straight ahead. Signal's good.

1128
01:13:04,361 --> 01:13:07,906
Three hundred yards. Clear signal.
Signal's locking in.

1129
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,701
They're moving southwest 200 yards.

1130
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:15,924
Go left
on Rue de l'Armée!

1131
01:13:16,165 --> 01:13:18,792
<i>Heading off the left now.
Stabilizing.</i>

1132
01:13:18,876 --> 01:13:19,960
Stabilizing?

1133
01:13:20,043 --> 01:13:21,753
<i>Signal's still stabilizing.</i>

1134
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:24,256
It's stationary.

1135
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:28,135
Search him!

1136
01:13:29,178 --> 01:13:30,429
Let's go, search him.

1137
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:32,306
Get me an address.

1138
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:35,476
- Can we get an address right away?
- Gaines, come here.

1139
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:38,395
- We're sending them in?
- Mmm-hmm.

1140
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:41,440
Tell Crowder to get out of there now
before this gets loud.

1141
01:13:55,746 --> 01:13:56,872
Come on, hurry!

1142
01:14:03,212 --> 01:14:05,214
Don't fucking move!

1143
01:14:05,297 --> 01:14:08,133
Hands where I can see 'em!
Keep your hands up!

1144
01:14:08,217 --> 01:14:10,594
Don't fucking move! Not a move!

1145
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:17,392
Motherfucker!

1146
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:56,807
You have one minute.

1147
01:15:10,529 --> 01:15:11,572
Hey, Cal.

1148
01:15:13,824 --> 01:15:16,326
You're not hallucinating. It's Mason.

1149
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:19,204
Are you okay? You look okay.

1150
01:15:21,123 --> 01:15:23,667
I'm here to help you,
but we don't have a lot of time.

1151
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,876
We gotta work quick.

1152
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,797
- Mason, how did you get here?
- Stop. Listen to me. All right?

1153
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:31,592
Now, Rafid Abu Rajal is missing.

1154
01:15:32,593 --> 01:15:35,012
And we're trying to make a trade for you.

1155
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:38,307
- The brother?
- Yes.

1156
01:15:38,932 --> 01:15:41,476
They asked me to come and make a deal.

1157
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,272
Now I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

1158
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:48,900
They sent me to Israel to try to find him.

1159
01:15:50,068 --> 01:15:52,529
You know how wild it can get there,

1160
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:54,906
and you have to goose things
along sometimes

1161
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,367
and chase things you don't wanna chase.

1162
01:15:57,451 --> 01:15:59,453
Israel? No, no, that's not who...

1163
01:15:59,536 --> 01:16:01,330
Karim has been very patient.

1164
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,749
Karim's been very patient.

1165
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:07,085
But your friends...

1166
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:08,962
Your friends at the Embassy...

1167
01:16:10,797 --> 01:16:12,007
They like this idea.

1168
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:17,136
Yeah.

1169
01:16:19,765 --> 01:16:22,100
I don't have many friends as I used to.

1170
01:16:22,184 --> 01:16:23,935
Okay, you can see everything's okay.

1171
01:16:24,436 --> 01:16:26,188
I think we all need friends.

1172
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:31,735
Cal, I know I could use a friend.
I could use someone to trust.

1173
01:16:32,903 --> 01:16:35,030
Right? Don't you think that's true?

1174
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:36,657
People can trust people

1175
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:39,368
based on whether or not
they have something to gain?

1176
01:16:39,951 --> 01:16:42,788
Right? What do you think about that, Cal?

1177
01:16:44,373 --> 01:16:46,375
What do you think about those gains?

1178
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:49,336
Do you think those gains can be trusted?

1179
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,420
No.

1180
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:54,174
No, I wouldn't trust those gains.

1181
01:16:56,259 --> 01:16:58,303
I'd feel a lot safer in a crowd.

1182
01:16:58,845 --> 01:16:59,680
In a crowd?

1183
01:16:59,763 --> 01:17:01,682
- More of a crowd.
- That's enough.

1184
01:17:01,765 --> 01:17:03,016
On a sandy beach.

1185
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,768
- That's enough.
- Sandy.

1186
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:05,686
It's enough.

1187
01:17:05,769 --> 01:17:07,521
- Have you talked to Alice?
- Mm-hmm.

1188
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:10,357
Get her to show you
the picture in my apartment.

1189
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,192
- Time is over.
- You need Abu Rajal?

1190
01:17:12,275 --> 01:17:13,275
That's all they want.

1191
01:17:13,318 --> 01:17:14,945
Tell Alice I pray she loves me only.

1192
01:17:15,028 --> 01:17:16,154
- What?
- Stop.

1193
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:18,073
Tell her I pray she loves me only!

1194
01:17:18,156 --> 01:17:19,741
- I pray she loves me only!
- Stop!

1195
01:17:19,825 --> 01:17:21,660
I pray she loves me only!

1196
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:24,204
- What was that?
- You told me I could talk to him.

1197
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:25,831
You have seven hours.

1198
01:17:26,748 --> 01:17:28,709
- How do I contact...
- No. Talking is finished.

1199
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:32,295
You come to Fadya Crossing
at 2:30 a.m. with my brother.

1200
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:34,631
Karim, that's not possible.

1201
01:17:34,881 --> 01:17:38,969
Okay. So I sell Riley to the Iranians.
Good luck with them.

1202
01:17:39,052 --> 01:17:41,471
Fadya Crossing, 2:30.

1203
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Stop!

1204
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:38,380
Put the bottle down.

1205
01:19:40,215 --> 01:19:42,926
- Think the gun is really necessary?
- I wish I knew.

1206
01:19:43,009 --> 01:19:44,678
Come up, come up. He's here.

1207
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:47,597
You might want
to wait a second.

1208
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:49,432
What the fuck are you doing here?

1209
01:19:49,516 --> 01:19:52,978
I'm here looking for something
that Cal told me was important.

1210
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:54,687
Turn around.

1211
01:19:56,481 --> 01:19:59,150
- When was this?
- About an hour ago.

1212
01:19:59,734 --> 01:20:01,152
Tell me something I can believe.

1213
01:20:03,905 --> 01:20:05,907
- Cal told me I could trust you.
- Sorry.

1214
01:20:06,491 --> 01:20:08,451
And that Gaines was not on our side.

1215
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:11,079
- Who are you working for?
- My friend.

1216
01:20:11,162 --> 01:20:12,831
Yeah? Cal or Karim?

1217
01:20:14,249 --> 01:20:15,834
He told me to look for a photo album,

1218
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:17,557
that there was something important in it.

1219
01:20:21,715 --> 01:20:22,799
Where is he?

1220
01:20:23,717 --> 01:20:24,801
- He's okay.
- Where?

1221
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:26,720
I don't know. We drove around.

1222
01:20:26,803 --> 01:20:28,597
- I was blindfolded.
- You took off the belt.

1223
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,557
Yes. Are you kidding?

1224
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,145
You think I want Ruzak dialing in
a rocket strike on my last known location?

1225
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:37,439
There's nothing in that photo album.

1226
01:20:37,522 --> 01:20:40,233
There's nothing here, Sandy.
What is going on?

1227
01:20:44,487 --> 01:20:47,240
Don Gaines has been skimming money
from the station budget.

1228
01:20:47,657 --> 01:20:49,659
There's a bank in Cyprus
and all this shit.

1229
01:20:50,827 --> 01:20:52,537
Cal found out and wrote a grievance.

1230
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:54,122
That's what you've been looking for.

1231
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:55,957
Cal wrote it up, but he wanted to wait

1232
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:58,752
through the cease-fire
before he blew the whistle.

1233
01:21:01,254 --> 01:21:03,048
And I took it out of the photo album.

1234
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:06,927
I didn't want Alice to find it
and light the fuse.

1235
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:11,264
Gaines is a thief and Cal knows about it.
You don't find that problematic?

1236
01:21:11,348 --> 01:21:13,988
- Don doesn't know any of this.
- Would you bet Cal's life on that?

1237
01:21:14,559 --> 01:21:16,811
Wouldn't matter. Cal's too valuable.

1238
01:21:16,895 --> 01:21:19,064
No, Sandy. Now, Cal is expendable.

1239
01:21:19,648 --> 01:21:22,442
He's a threat to Gaines
and a speed bump to Ruzak.

1240
01:21:22,525 --> 01:21:23,902
They're just gonna burn him.

1241
01:21:23,985 --> 01:21:25,403
Now they don't have to wait.

1242
01:21:25,487 --> 01:21:26,655
What do you mean?

1243
01:21:26,738 --> 01:21:29,824
Karim has given us six hours
to deliver the brother.

1244
01:21:32,327 --> 01:21:34,412
You're wrong. We've got a deadline.

1245
01:21:34,996 --> 01:21:37,791
They'll get the White House involved.
Israel has to budge.

1246
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:39,668
Israel never had Abu Rajal.

1247
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:44,381
They never said they did.
It cost them nothing to toy with Ruzak.

1248
01:21:44,965 --> 01:21:46,049
Sandy?

1249
01:21:47,133 --> 01:21:48,385
Yes, I'm here.

1250
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:51,513
Listen. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1251
01:21:51,596 --> 01:21:57,185
Cal called it, okay? He kept saying,
"Pray. Love. Only.

1252
01:21:57,268 --> 01:22:00,355
Pray. Love. Only."

1253
01:22:00,438 --> 01:22:01,690
I think he's right.

1254
01:22:02,565 --> 01:22:04,734
I think the PLO have Abu Rajal.

1255
01:22:04,818 --> 01:22:06,277
What are we doing?

1256
01:22:09,531 --> 01:22:11,324
Get the car.

1257
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:14,077
Come on,
think about it.

1258
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,454
You're the PLO. You're Arafat.

1259
01:22:16,538 --> 01:22:18,999
You're desperately trying
to hold this cease-fire together.

1260
01:22:19,082 --> 01:22:21,876
The last thing you want
is the Israelis crossing the border.

1261
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:25,588
One more incident, one more bomb,
another assassination,

1262
01:22:25,672 --> 01:22:27,298
and they'll stop asking for permission.

1263
01:22:27,382 --> 01:22:29,676
They're gonna roll up
and push you right into the sea.

1264
01:22:29,759 --> 01:22:32,262
Rafid Abu Rajal
and his little splinter group?

1265
01:22:32,345 --> 01:22:34,973
That's a problem. He's uncontrollable.

1266
01:22:35,056 --> 01:22:36,391
What do you do if you're Arafat?

1267
01:22:36,474 --> 01:22:41,312
I think I would take him off the table.
I would put Abu Rajal on ice.

1268
01:22:41,396 --> 01:22:44,024
Because Abu Rajal wants this to fuck up.

1269
01:22:44,107 --> 01:22:46,151
He'd rather put a match
to this whole thing.

1270
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:50,030
Ruzak wants the same thing as Abu Rajal.

1271
01:22:51,156 --> 01:22:54,367
<i>He said it. We heard him.
"Two birds, one stone."</i>

1272
01:22:55,785 --> 01:22:57,370
<i>He wants this to go sideways.</i>

1273
01:22:57,454 --> 01:22:58,454
<i>He wants to tip it over</i>

1274
01:22:58,496 --> 01:23:00,874
and give Israel all the reason it needs
to come on in here.

1275
01:23:00,957 --> 01:23:05,295
Come on. This is Cal talking.
This is him telling us what's going on.

1276
01:23:06,963 --> 01:23:10,633
<i>If you let Gaines and Ruzak
and the White House and Tel Aviv,</i>

1277
01:23:10,717 --> 01:23:13,803
<i>if you let them run their game,
Cal's gone.</i>

1278
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:19,267
Waiting only increases the risk.

1279
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:22,771
- You understand that, right?
- We blew our chance today.

1280
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:26,566
I need a master list
of Cal's assets and code keys.

1281
01:23:26,649 --> 01:23:28,985
We'll start prioritizing
his people quickly,

1282
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:32,363
so we can get the relocation budgets
in place for the folks who qualify.

1283
01:23:32,864 --> 01:23:35,325
- You're hearing me, right?
- It's a death sentence.

1284
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:39,037
Jesus, Sandy.
Nobody's quitting on Cal, okay?

1285
01:23:39,412 --> 01:23:41,164
But we get paid to be ready.

1286
01:23:41,247 --> 01:23:43,958
There's a hell of a lot
of unprotected pieces in the field.

1287
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:45,919
You think I don't know how you feel?

1288
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,588
That could be any of us out there.

1289
01:23:51,925 --> 01:23:53,426
You're right.

1290
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:54,969
Maybe we'll get lucky.

1291
01:23:56,387 --> 01:23:58,932
There's a secondary issue here
with Skiles.

1292
01:23:59,724 --> 01:24:02,018
We need to wrap him up
as quickly as possible.

1293
01:24:02,977 --> 01:24:05,438
It's covered.
We picked him up half an hour ago.

1294
01:24:05,522 --> 01:24:09,150
- Where?
- The bar at the Napoli Hotel.

1295
01:24:09,734 --> 01:24:12,028
<i>They're gonna bring him over
as soon as he's sober.</i>

1296
01:24:12,112 --> 01:24:13,738
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1297
01:24:13,822 --> 01:24:16,991
<i>You know what, though?
Don't sober him up.</i>

1298
01:24:18,284 --> 01:24:19,494
<i>Keep him bombed.</i>

1299
01:24:20,078 --> 01:24:24,541
Get his signature on a security release
and pour him onto a transpo tonight.

1300
01:24:26,918 --> 01:24:27,918
Okay.

1301
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:29,087
Hey, Sandy?

1302
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,257
You've done a hell of a job.

1303
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,760
I hope you know that.
It hasn't gone unnoticed.

1304
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,015
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

1305
01:25:11,045 --> 01:25:12,297
You change your mind?

1306
01:25:13,006 --> 01:25:14,424
Little late for that.

1307
01:25:14,507 --> 01:25:15,508
What do you mean?

1308
01:25:15,592 --> 01:25:16,592
In an hour and a half,

1309
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:19,179
the Embassy duty officer
is gonna open the fifth floor safe

1310
01:25:19,846 --> 01:25:22,098
and discover
four million dollars is missing.

1311
01:25:24,976 --> 01:25:27,437
You're right. We're on our own.
That's Raffik.

1312
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,082
- Put them in back.
- He's coming with us.

1313
01:25:30,106 --> 01:25:33,776
- Where is it we're going?
- I thought we'd try and make a deal.

1314
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:36,487
And do what? Shake down the PLO?

1315
01:25:36,571 --> 01:25:40,283
Why not? I bet you're pretty handy
with four million bucks.

1316
01:26:10,939 --> 01:26:12,059
Sandrine?

1317
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:14,067
Sandrine?

1318
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,151
My love!

1319
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:27,622
Listen closely, Bashir.

1320
01:26:29,207 --> 01:26:31,417
You're going to tell me
what I want to know

1321
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:33,836
or this is the last breath you'll take.

1322
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,673
- What the fuck nonsense is this?
- Rafid Abu Rajal!

1323
01:26:36,923 --> 01:26:38,258
Where is he?

1324
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:39,926
Where?

1325
01:26:41,636 --> 01:26:43,972
You're not my only option, Bashir.

1326
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,478
Fuck you!

1327
01:26:50,937 --> 01:26:51,813
Kill her.

1328
01:26:51,896 --> 01:26:54,440
No.

1329
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:00,280
- The gun?
- Do what I tell you!

1330
01:27:01,781 --> 01:27:03,676
- Too much noise...
- For chrissake.

1331
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,326
In the bedroom.
Go! Kill her.

1332
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:07,578
No. No.

1333
01:27:08,204 --> 01:27:09,205
Sandrine!

1334
01:27:11,124 --> 01:27:12,524
What craziness is this?

1335
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:15,336
You let a woman tell you what to do?

1336
01:27:28,516 --> 01:27:30,351
Let's try one more time.

1337
01:27:33,313 --> 01:27:35,148
Rafid Abu Rajal?

1338
01:27:35,231 --> 01:27:36,232
Where is he?

1339
01:27:40,069 --> 01:27:42,109
Now that you told us where he is,

1340
01:27:42,155 --> 01:27:44,532
all you gotta do is go get him for us.

1341
01:27:46,409 --> 01:27:47,785
Call it a finder's fee.

1342
01:27:48,453 --> 01:27:51,456
$50,000 now, $50,000 on completion.

1343
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:53,750
That's a $100,000 phone call, Bashir.

1344
01:27:54,334 --> 01:27:58,421
Plus another two million
if you can deliver Abu Rajal

1345
01:27:58,504 --> 01:28:02,050
to Al-Mazar Square alive in the next hour.

1346
01:28:07,764 --> 01:28:08,765
It's not so easy.

1347
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:11,309
I know it's not so easy. We all know that.

1348
01:28:11,392 --> 01:28:13,311
That's why we're asking so nicely.

1349
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,772
And if the Old Man says no?

1350
01:28:15,855 --> 01:28:19,567
If the Old Man says no,
then all this money goes home.

1351
01:28:24,614 --> 01:28:26,574
<i>Duty officer says
she signed the log.</i>

1352
01:28:26,657 --> 01:28:28,826
Thought it was for petty cash.

1353
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:30,912
All of it?
The whole four million?

1354
01:28:30,995 --> 01:28:34,040
- She knows Riley's code.
- Oh, my God!

1355
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:37,377
She's got radio equipment,
vehicle, weapons.

1356
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:49,722
Get ready.

1357
01:28:57,397 --> 01:29:00,108
Yes, I trust him.
He's one of Cal's people.

1358
01:29:01,025 --> 01:29:02,860
Cal doesn't come back, he's cooked.

1359
01:29:03,194 --> 01:29:04,821
He's fighting for his life.

1360
01:29:04,904 --> 01:29:09,742
Is that what you're doing? For Cal?
Making a hell of an effort.

1361
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:15,081
It's not some huge romance,
if that's what you think.

1362
01:29:16,999 --> 01:29:18,126
It's not.

1363
01:29:20,878 --> 01:29:23,881
We're here, and it gets lonely.

1364
01:29:26,467 --> 01:29:28,177
Better me than someone else.

1365
01:29:28,594 --> 01:29:30,596
Hmm. Okay.

1366
01:29:31,389 --> 01:29:33,891
Come on, Bashir. He has to be here now.

1367
01:29:33,975 --> 01:29:36,102
He won't ditch us for 50 grand.

1368
01:29:36,185 --> 01:29:38,646
If he tries to rip us off,
it'll be for the whole package.

1369
01:29:43,985 --> 01:29:46,988
What's it like to throw
your whole career away in one night?

1370
01:29:47,822 --> 01:29:51,409
- You should know, right?
- You're tougher than I was.

1371
01:29:54,245 --> 01:29:57,707
I don't get surprised very often.
Not in a good way.

1372
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,877
That's my version of a compliment.

1373
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,504
All right. Thank you.

1374
01:30:03,588 --> 01:30:05,798
<i>Two cars approaching.</i>

1375
01:30:06,549 --> 01:30:07,633
Which direction?

1376
01:30:07,717 --> 01:30:09,427
<i>Southeast on Rue de Damas.</i>

1377
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:11,095
They're coming southeast.

1378
01:30:11,179 --> 01:30:12,847
<i>Okay.</i>

1379
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:15,057
She's telling him to get ready.

1380
01:30:16,017 --> 01:30:18,603
- She's keyed off.
- Can you triangulate the exact location?

1381
01:30:18,686 --> 01:30:21,286
She's smarter than that.
She's using just two walkies.

1382
01:30:21,314 --> 01:30:22,899
I may be able to track the UHS signal.

1383
01:30:22,982 --> 01:30:25,359
- Rue de Damas, where is it?
- Along here.

1384
01:30:26,611 --> 01:30:29,197
There you go, $2 million.

1385
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,032
Two million is not enough.

1386
01:30:31,115 --> 01:30:32,158
I'm in a hurry.

1387
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:35,995
I'm already overpaying because
you know that, but I like my offer.

1388
01:30:36,078 --> 01:30:37,413
The answer to two million is no.

1389
01:30:37,496 --> 01:30:41,292
Mason, it's him. It's Abu Rajal.

1390
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:42,585
May we speak privately?

1391
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:50,343
We told Bashir two million,
and you brought us Abu Rajal.

1392
01:30:50,426 --> 01:30:54,472
So let's get this settled quickly.
This is it. All I got.

1393
01:30:54,555 --> 01:30:56,307
I'm topped out. Deal speaks for itself.

1394
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:59,352
You wouldn't open with your best offer
if your life depended on it.

1395
01:31:02,939 --> 01:31:04,607
- Two point two-five.
- Five million.

1396
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:06,317
- Three.
- Four and a half is my floor.

1397
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,278
Point blank, I have $3.9 million exactly.

1398
01:31:09,362 --> 01:31:10,404
Going once.

1399
01:31:10,488 --> 01:31:12,490
Why should Bashir
be the only person to profit?

1400
01:31:12,573 --> 01:31:15,826
- Going twice.
- If you take the three-nine right now,

1401
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:18,496
I swear I will tell Bashir
you settled for three-five.

1402
01:31:19,205 --> 01:31:21,832
You can go back to Arafat
with your head held high

1403
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:24,126
and $400,000 in your pocket.

1404
01:31:29,298 --> 01:31:30,132
Deal.

1405
01:31:30,216 --> 01:31:32,760
All right, let's go.
We got him. Bring him.

1406
01:31:35,972 --> 01:31:37,181
Get the rest of the money.

1407
01:31:37,265 --> 01:31:38,558
This is the all the money.

1408
01:31:39,433 --> 01:31:41,185
I had a feeling we could work this out.

1409
01:31:41,769 --> 01:31:43,229
The thing that scares me about this

1410
01:31:43,312 --> 01:31:46,107
is you haven't asked me
what I'm gonna do with him.

1411
01:31:46,983 --> 01:31:48,359
At these prices...

1412
01:31:48,442 --> 01:31:53,572
I want you to look at my hand.
You see that? It's a laser sight.

1413
01:31:53,656 --> 01:31:57,285
It's attached to a very high-powered rifle
that my friend Raffik has up there.

1414
01:31:59,578 --> 01:32:01,205
I've never seen anything like it.

1415
01:32:02,832 --> 01:32:04,667
- I thought you came in good faith.
- I did.

1416
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,752
Now I want to leave in one piece.

1417
01:32:06,836 --> 01:32:08,379
You don't move until after we leave,

1418
01:32:08,462 --> 01:32:10,339
maybe you'll live to spend that money.

1419
01:32:12,633 --> 01:32:13,759
Let's go.

1420
01:32:18,556 --> 01:32:21,058
- Where the hell are they?
- Downstairs, sir.

1421
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:34,405
How much longer?

1422
01:32:36,157 --> 01:32:37,283
Maybe he'll wait.

1423
01:32:41,495 --> 01:32:42,855
We've waited too long.

1424
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,917
Let's get out of here!

1425
01:32:48,252 --> 01:32:50,713
Listen, I want to go! Let's go.

1426
01:32:52,882 --> 01:32:53,883
Go!

1427
01:32:54,467 --> 01:32:55,468
Let's go.

1428
01:33:04,894 --> 01:33:07,146
Heads up!
300 meters.

1429
01:33:08,022 --> 01:33:09,899
It's the Christian militia.

1430
01:33:18,574 --> 01:33:19,992
I'll talk our way through.

1431
01:33:20,076 --> 01:33:22,119
With Abu Rajal in the car? Impossible!

1432
01:33:25,539 --> 01:33:27,166
- Rami, no!
- I'm going through!

1433
01:33:32,963 --> 01:33:33,963
We can make it!

1434
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:51,065
Fuck.

1435
01:33:57,113 --> 01:33:58,864
You're crazy!

1436
01:34:11,544 --> 01:34:13,421
They're not coming!

1437
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:17,675
Come on, they're not coming!

1438
01:34:27,518 --> 01:34:28,727
Turn off the engine.

1439
01:34:29,812 --> 01:34:30,813
Turn it off!

1440
01:35:00,593 --> 01:35:01,593
Stay alert!

1441
01:35:01,635 --> 01:35:04,722
Where are you going?
They're waiting for me.

1442
01:35:05,306 --> 01:35:06,432
Anything might happen.

1443
01:35:06,515 --> 01:35:08,058
I'm not staying here.

1444
01:35:08,642 --> 01:35:11,270
Another second with this murdering fuck,
and I'll lose my mind.

1445
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:16,317
May this be your last
lucky day, you son of a whore!

1446
01:35:17,693 --> 01:35:19,173
You're right. He's right.

1447
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:26,035
What the hell is this?

1448
01:35:26,118 --> 01:35:27,786
You're not putting this through.

1449
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:29,705
You can bet your ass I am.

1450
01:35:29,788 --> 01:35:33,042
- Frank, this is not your area.
- This is an intel operation.

1451
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:34,627
It's a goddamn rodeo.

1452
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:37,421
- <i>Mason, do you read me?</i>
- They keyed back in.

1453
01:35:37,505 --> 01:35:38,881
<i>Yes, I can hear you.</i>

1454
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:43,010
<i>It's him. It's Karim.</i>

1455
01:35:43,594 --> 01:35:45,596
- The goddamn location. Come on.
- Almost there.

1456
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,016
I'll keep the walkie keyed,
so you can hear what's going on.

1457
01:35:50,017 --> 01:35:51,017
Copy.

1458
01:36:02,071 --> 01:36:06,867
Cal goes first. He makes it across safe,
then you get your brother.

1459
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:07,951
Why should I do that?

1460
01:36:08,994 --> 01:36:11,247
Because you'll have me. I'll stay.

1461
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:12,957
You're not worth so much.

1462
01:36:13,457 --> 01:36:15,376
Maybe you should've had
someone more important

1463
01:36:15,459 --> 01:36:16,752
make your deal for you.

1464
01:36:21,632 --> 01:36:22,925
All right. All right.

1465
01:36:23,384 --> 01:36:25,678
We're moving forward.
Cal's gonna come over.

1466
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:28,240
<i>- Till then, stay put.</i>
- I'm getting a lock on this.

1467
01:36:28,264 --> 01:36:29,598
Figure out the location...

1468
01:36:29,682 --> 01:36:31,517
Just give me 30 seconds.

1469
01:36:32,101 --> 01:36:33,519
Get a team rolling now.

1470
01:36:33,602 --> 01:36:36,313
- Looks like...
- Get a fucking team rolling!

1471
01:36:36,397 --> 01:36:39,233
No, God damn it! This is Mason's deal.

1472
01:36:39,316 --> 01:36:42,278
It's his hand,
and you're gonna let him play it.

1473
01:36:42,361 --> 01:36:43,862
You step in now,

1474
01:36:43,946 --> 01:36:46,991
and I'll make sure you own this
all the way to a Senate hearing.

1475
01:37:01,046 --> 01:37:02,256
I think about Nadia.

1476
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,679
Always good people suffer the most, huh?

1477
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:13,350
Were we that wrong about you?

1478
01:37:13,434 --> 01:37:15,936
What? Was I a terrorist?

1479
01:37:18,397 --> 01:37:19,398
Not then.

1480
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:21,900
Not that night.

1481
01:37:24,028 --> 01:37:25,613
But in the morning.

1482
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:32,450
Cut him loose.

1483
01:37:40,586 --> 01:37:44,423
<i>How you doing, buddy. You okay?
Here's the deal.</i>

1484
01:37:45,174 --> 01:37:48,677
You're gonna go over alone.
I'll stay here until it's done.

1485
01:37:50,929 --> 01:37:51,930
That's your plan?

1486
01:37:52,014 --> 01:37:54,058
It's kind of a work in progress.

1487
01:37:56,393 --> 01:37:57,770
Shit.

1488
01:37:57,895 --> 01:38:00,356
All right, go.
I'll see you on the other side.

1489
01:38:02,107 --> 01:38:03,275
Go!

1490
01:38:06,445 --> 01:38:08,614
He's coming over.
Get the brother ready.

1491
01:38:08,697 --> 01:38:10,032
Copy that.

1492
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,121
Cal?

1493
01:38:16,789 --> 01:38:18,832
Yeah. It's me.

1494
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:28,967
Cal.

1495
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,321
Rafid!

1496
01:38:53,575 --> 01:38:56,453
I knew you'd be safe.

1497
01:38:56,537 --> 01:38:57,913
Karim, are we good?

1498
01:38:57,996 --> 01:38:59,415
Let him go.

1499
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:07,256
And I thank you, brother.

1500
01:39:09,675 --> 01:39:11,275
- Rafid, no!
- Whoa!

1501
01:39:11,301 --> 01:39:13,941
- Curse me, do you?
- What's he doing?

1502
01:39:13,971 --> 01:39:16,098
- You're free, Rafid.
- Curse me now!

1503
01:39:16,181 --> 01:39:18,016
We're done here.
It's all good.

1504
01:39:18,809 --> 01:39:20,144
Rafid, put the gun...

1505
01:39:20,227 --> 01:39:21,227
Go, Mason. Go!

1506
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:30,904
Rafid!

1507
01:39:32,448 --> 01:39:33,615
Rafid!

1508
01:39:37,953 --> 01:39:38,953
Move! Move!

1509
01:39:51,008 --> 01:39:52,009
Mason!

1510
01:39:54,344 --> 01:39:55,721
Mason, come on!

1511
01:39:58,515 --> 01:40:00,809
Grab my hand! Grab it!

1512
01:40:04,354 --> 01:40:05,564
All right, I got you.

1513
01:40:20,829 --> 01:40:23,624
Bernard! Great!

1514
01:40:23,707 --> 01:40:25,000
Get in! Get in!

1515
01:40:25,876 --> 01:40:27,377
Sandrine!

1516
01:40:27,461 --> 01:40:28,796
Get in! Good girl!

1517
01:40:33,258 --> 01:40:35,177
Okay, let's go!

1518
01:40:51,985 --> 01:40:53,362
Almost done here.

1519
01:40:57,699 --> 01:40:59,243
All right, you're all set.

1520
01:41:19,304 --> 01:41:20,681
I'll let you talk to Mason.

1521
01:41:21,598 --> 01:41:22,598
Okay.

1522
01:41:31,775 --> 01:41:32,775
You good?

1523
01:41:34,027 --> 01:41:36,363
I'll let you know
once these meds wear off.

1524
01:41:36,905 --> 01:41:37,905
How about you?

1525
01:41:38,574 --> 01:41:41,743
I'll let you know after I get a shower.

1526
01:41:42,619 --> 01:41:44,163
Think they'll ever find Karim?

1527
01:41:45,372 --> 01:41:47,374
Well, if he doesn't find us first.

1528
01:41:49,585 --> 01:41:52,588
I still cannot believe
you pulled this through, man.

1529
01:41:53,547 --> 01:41:55,841
I mean, I feel like I won the lottery.

1530
01:41:57,509 --> 01:41:59,845
You saved my life
and I got to see you again.

1531
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:05,309
Let's not take so long to do it next time.
Okay?

1532
01:42:06,643 --> 01:42:07,728
I would like that.

1533
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:11,607
Thank you, Cal.

1534
01:42:15,152 --> 01:42:16,570
That's the meds talking.

1535
01:42:19,865 --> 01:42:22,534
Are you up for a quick debrief
at the Embassy?

1536
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:26,038
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

1537
01:42:26,121 --> 01:42:28,248
Yeah, well, it's more of a luncheon.

1538
01:42:28,874 --> 01:42:29,958
Ruzak gonna be there?

1539
01:42:30,042 --> 01:42:34,129
He's in the air back to DC.
He's got some powerful friends.

1540
01:42:34,212 --> 01:42:35,923
Who's in charge of the station?

1541
01:42:36,006 --> 01:42:39,509
Well, that job just opened up.
Don Gaines resigned this morning.

1542
01:42:39,593 --> 01:42:41,094
Not exactly sure why.

1543
01:42:41,178 --> 01:42:44,139
But we did come in on budget.

1544
01:42:44,389 --> 01:42:45,849
All I'm saying, Mason,

1545
01:42:45,933 --> 01:42:49,561
is that there is a general satisfaction
all around with the results here.

1546
01:42:49,645 --> 01:42:52,147
- Is that what you're saying?
- Things happened in haste.

1547
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:54,524
People acted in ways

1548
01:42:54,608 --> 01:42:58,987
that might be subject
to a variety of legitimate interpretation.

1549
01:42:59,071 --> 01:43:00,656
Enough dancing, Frank.

1550
01:43:01,907 --> 01:43:05,369
Everybody got what they wanted.
It's a rare thing.

1551
01:43:05,452 --> 01:43:07,079
Might as well enjoy it.

1552
01:43:08,664 --> 01:43:11,583
- So, you riding with me?
- I got him.

1553
01:43:17,839 --> 01:43:21,468
Just forget all this ever happened, huh?
You really gonna go for that?

1554
01:43:22,219 --> 01:43:23,553
You should try it.

1555
01:43:24,137 --> 01:43:26,890
If I were you, I'd kiss this place goodbye
once and for all.

1556
01:43:27,307 --> 01:43:28,642
What if you were you?

1557
01:43:30,018 --> 01:43:32,187
I've got
a pretty good bargaining position.

1558
01:43:33,397 --> 01:43:36,108
They already offered up
some pleasant options.

1559
01:43:37,025 --> 01:43:38,705
You got somebody making that deal for you?

1560
01:43:41,446 --> 01:43:42,864
I've got a short list.

1561
01:43:44,241 --> 01:43:46,994
I'm around till dinner
if you really want to stick it to 'em.

1562
01:44:24,531 --> 01:44:27,242
The Israeli Army has moved
into southern Lebanon.

1563
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,495
It has a clear-cut single mission.

1564
01:44:30,579 --> 01:44:32,748
<i>Namely, pushing the PLO forces</i>

1565
01:44:32,831 --> 01:44:35,333
<i>out of artillery range
of Israeli settlements.</i>

1566
01:44:35,417 --> 01:44:37,336
<i>After months
of rocket attacks,</i>

1567
01:44:37,419 --> 01:44:39,087
<i>Israeli soldiers backed up by tanks</i>

1568
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:42,049
<i>move up the coastal road into West Beirut.</i>

1569
01:44:42,132 --> 01:44:45,427
<i>The Israeli invasion
of Lebanon has been deep and wide.</i>

1570
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:48,013
It encompasses an area
smaller than Delaware

1571
01:44:48,096 --> 01:44:49,598
and a third larger than Rhode Island.

1572
01:44:49,681 --> 01:44:52,934
<i>Evacuation of
over 800 PLO fighters began today,</i>

1573
01:44:53,018 --> 01:44:55,771
<i>as more American troops arrived in Beirut
to keep the peace.</i>

1574
01:44:55,854 --> 01:44:58,982
<i>Pentagon officials say
this terrorist attack</i>

1575
01:44:59,066 --> 01:45:01,443
<i>caused the four-story structure
to collapse,</i>

1576
01:45:02,027 --> 01:45:03,695
<i>trapping and killing those Marines.</i>

1577
01:45:03,779 --> 01:45:07,157
<i>In Beirut today,
a pickup truck loaded with explosives</i>

1578
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:08,784
<i>drove to the American Embassy</i>

1579
01:45:08,867 --> 01:45:12,120
<i>and there was a tremendous explosion
during lunch hour.</i>

1580
01:45:12,204 --> 01:45:13,205
<i>Peter Jennings begins...</i>

1581
01:45:13,288 --> 01:45:15,888
<i>This criminal attack
on a diplomatic establishment</i>

1582
01:45:15,916 --> 01:45:20,796
will not deter us from our goals of peace
in the region.
