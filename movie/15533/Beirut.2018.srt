1
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,827
For 4,000 years...

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,962
...villains and heroes,
and they don't do that here.

3
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,297
Here, you have Jews, Muslims, Christians,

4
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
all living shoulder to shoulder,
and it's messy.

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,760
And the challenge
for the State Department, for us...

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,305
Sounds like
I'm not gonna get a quick answer.

7
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,599
Mason's just playing the diplomat,
Congressman.

8
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,310
He's been here long enough
to explain this place in a minute.

9
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,440
Let's have
the shorter version. Give me the snapshot.

10
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,986
I don't know if I'd call it
a snapshot, but I tell people,

11
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,115
"If you wanna understand Lebanon, think
of a boardinghouse without a landlord."

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,285
The only thing the tenants have in common

13
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,120
is their talent for betrayal.

14
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:23,959
So these people have been living together,
cheek by jowl, 20 centuries.

15
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,590
2,000 years of revenge, blood feuds,
vendetta, murder.

16
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,550
One night there's a storm.

17
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,720
Raining like hell.
There's a knock at the door.

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,888
Who is it? It's the Palestinians.

19
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,433
They want in.
They've been up and down the block.

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,102
They had doors slammed in their face.
They're cold. They're tired.

21
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,521
They want in and they want in now.

22
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,316
So the house is thrown into confusion.

23
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,694
Tenants arguing.
Some of 'em violently opposed.

24
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,614
Some think, "Let 'em in.
They'll be gone tomorrow."

25
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,115
Some think, "I let them in tonight,

26
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,992
then I'll have an ally against my enemy."

27
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,245
Some of 'em are terrified
if they keep the door shut.

28
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,956
So it isn't until after
the Palestinians move in

29
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,877
that the other people in the house
realize the tragedy of the situation.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,588
That the Palestinians want nothing more

31
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,215
than to just burn down
the Israeli house next door.

32
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,347
Welcome to Beirut.

33
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,807
I told you he's good.

34
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,768
- Sure is.
- And so it goes.

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,729
Mr. Skiles.

36
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,023
Ã‡a Va? How are you?

37
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,653
You look beautiful. You look great.
Mason Skiles. How do you do?

38
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,571
We have not met. How do you do?

39
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,573
Nice to see you again. There he is.

40
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,076
We know who
we don't wanna make deals with.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,745
The lessons of Vietnam have been learned.

42
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,996
And I think our president

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,249
has got his own things
on the domestic front to deal with.

44
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:51,380
But what we definitely don't wanna do is
establish any sort of permanent presence.

45
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,507
- Where are you from?
- Washington, DC.

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,301
Well, good for you. Welcome. Here we are.

47
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,095
The party is a delight.

48
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,137
Thank you!

49
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,264
We understand
that Beirut, specifically,

50
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,642
and Lebanon, more generally,

51
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,020
has enough people coming in
and trying to put fingerprints on it.

52
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,438
We don't wanna be one of those.

53
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,233
We just wanna make sure
everybody has a fair playing ground

54
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,277
to contribute
to a stable regional economy.

55
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,695
That's what I think.

56
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,741
The congressman
can certainly speak more to that.

57
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,576
Karim, this is some friends of ours.

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,079
This is Agnes and Joanne
from the United Kingdom.

59
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,373
Karim's been keeping everybody well-fed.

60
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,708
- Good job.
- Thank you.

61
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,377
How old is he?
He looks young.

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,711
He's about 13.

63
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,132
He's from one of the Palestinian
refugee camps in West Beirut.

64
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,677
He stuck around,
and he's become a part of the family,

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,886
which is very nice.

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,013
- My lovely wife, Nadia.
- Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,142
- You know the congressman.
- Are you enjoying Beirut?

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,103
- We've been having a very nice time.
- Yeah. Yes.

69
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,648
I find it's a beautiful place,
full of beautiful people.

70
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,858
Yes.

71
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,068
One beautiful person in particular.

72
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,906
As a diplomat in the Middle East,
you have to think on your feet.

73
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,409
And the more you do it,
the better you get at it.

74
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,619
When you talk about making deals,

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,705
the most important thing
is to keep talking.

76
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,708
As soon as the talking stops,
the fighting starts.

77
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,669
You need to come in
from a diplomatic standpoint

78
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,256
and explain to everybody involved,
"This is what we have to work with.

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,092
These are the pieces
on the game board right now."

80
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,179
Thank you for being here.
I'm gonna leave you in very capable hands.

81
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,597
I've gotta say hi to somebody.

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,182
Thanks so much. Good to see you.

83
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,059
Alice. Alice, all alone.

84
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,313
I heard you had congressmen.

85
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,148
You know how that drives me wild.

86
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,108
Where is Cal? I could use a hand.

87
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,860
He's coming. Just something at the office.

88
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,528
Everyone behaving themselves?

89
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,239
It's early.

90
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,824
Come on. Let's get you a drink.

91
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,785
- Hungry?
- Famished.

92
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,995
Hurry up, girls!

93
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,163
It's dinner time!

94
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,665
Mmm-mmm. Mmm.

95
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,334
- How we doing?
- Good.

96
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,586
Christians in one corner,
Muslims in the other

97
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,962
and Jack Daniel's in between.

98
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,756
Dinner's close. Everyone here?

99
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,467
Cal's late, but Alice said
we should start without him.

100
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,552
How are you, sweetie?

101
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,720
My next life?

102
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,348
- In your next life, you marry a carpenter.
- Mmm.

103
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,818
Where you been hiding?

104
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,070
The drivers out back,
they took everything.

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,738
The drivers clean you out?

106
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,907
They live to eat.

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,492
There you go.

108
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,327
Get you reloaded
and back out there.

109
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,971
Pardon. Pardon.

110
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
- Hey. How are ya?
- Hey, sweetie.

111
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,932
Have you seen Mason?

112
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,933
You look tense.

113
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,811
No, no. Just wanna talk
to Mason for a second.

114
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,979
What's wrong?

115
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,480
Nothing. I just...

116
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,317
Hello, Karim. Look at you.
Don't you look elegant.

117
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,737
- Don't you think so, Cal?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very elegant.

118
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,157
I understand congratulations are in order.

119
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,201
Nadia told me
you did really well on your exams.

120
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,327
She helped a lot.

121
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,788
But she's not the one
who took the test, is she?

122
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,915
You heard about this, right?

123
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,960
Yeah. Very impressive.
Excuse me, I'm just gonna...

124
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,637
Hey! There you are.
I was having a nightmare.

125
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,764
I was gonna have to babysit
these yahoos by myself.

126
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,850
- We need to talk.
- You need a drink.

127
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,020
Too much mingling with congressmen
will make you lose faith in democracy.

128
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,479
Indeed. We need to talk.

129
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,027
Mas, we've been through
a lot together. Right?

130
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,697
And somehow we've managed
to steer around the icebergs.

131
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,823
No, thank you.

132
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,784
Cal, spit it out. We have 25 people
out there waiting for dinner.

133
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,079
I've never come to you
with anything operational.

134
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,333
- We've always been clean.
- What the fuck are we talking about?

135
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,252
Karim.

136
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,172
It's about Karim.
They want him for questioning.

137
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,883
- Who wants him?
- Everybody.

138
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,679
- He's got a brother. Did you know that?
- What? No, he's got no one.

139
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,765
Why do you think Nadia took him in?

140
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,726
Rafid Abu Rajal.
They were separated in '68.

141
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,353
Karim came here to Beirut.

142
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,230
Rafid went to prison
for two years in Jordan.

143
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,231
Hold on.

144
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,276
Where's this going?

145
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,028
Munich.

146
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,449
The brother left a rental car
outside the Olympic Village.

147
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:34,788
They've got prints. They've got a witness.
They got this, Mas.

148
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,876
That's Karim and his brother
six months ago here in Beirut.

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,044
They who?

150
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,713
There's an operations supervisor
at the bottom of the driveway.

151
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,881
They want him now.

152
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,716
They who? Mossad?

153
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,094
I can help you. I can't make this go away.

154
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,178
So it is Mossad.

155
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,098
- Israel just drops a dime...
- Your people are all over this.

156
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,182
This is bullshit.

157
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:58,228
The State Department froze
your security access two hours ago. Okay?

158
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,982
Someone talked. It leaked.
It's gotta be now. It's not safe.

159
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,984
Cal, it's Karim for fuck's sake.

160
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,361
You've got the kid brother
of Global Enemy Number One

161
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,279
serving canapes to congressmen.

162
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,073
What are you gonna do?
Drag him out of here?

163
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,327
You think Nadia's gonna go for that?
She just filed papers for his sponsorship.

164
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,163
We just got him a student visa,
for chrissakes.

165
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,875
He's part of the family, Cal.

166
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,837
Not my call.

167
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:31,136
You go tell your boss that I'll be
down to talk to him in five minutes.

168
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,185
Karim, you be honest with me.

169
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,230
If you lie to me, if you hang me up,
I cannot help you.

170
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,358
Your brother.

171
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,487
Is he dead?

172
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,701
- Is he dead?
- When is the last time you saw him?

173
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,202
Is he dead? Is Rafid dead?

174
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,996
He's not dead. Okay?

175
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,124
I need you to answer my question.
When did you see him last?

176
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,125
Months... Six months.

177
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,126
Six months where?

178
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,461
He comes to me.

179
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,129
He comes to you where?

180
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,298
I turn around and he's there...

181
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,382
on the street.

182
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,676
On the street.
He's here? In Beirut?

183
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,844
No! In Spain.

184
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,054
He lives in Spain now.

185
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,430
He cooks to make a restaurant.

186
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,098
Why would you lie to me about this?

187
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,349
Why are you angry?

188
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,729
Okay. I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at you. Okay?

189
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,440
I just need you
to tell me the truth. Okay?

190
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:27,901
His passport...

191
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,112
He took a Spain passport.

192
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,363
A new name.

193
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,657
He says no one can know.

194
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,659
If I tell anyone, he loses everything!

195
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,161
I promised him!

196
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,497
What's going on out here?

197
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,794
Go. Now. Go to the kitchen. Wait there.

198
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,337
What did he do?

199
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,632
I don't know. Nothing, maybe.
I don't know.

200
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,758
I need to handle this.

201
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,677
Go back inside,
make sure dinner gets out in time, okay?

202
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,970
I'll be back in a few minutes.

203
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,514
This is bad, isn't it?

204
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,724
It's nothing that can't be fixed.
All right?

205
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,438
Karim.

206
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,650
Are you okay?

207
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,818
What is it?

208
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,069
Huh?

209
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,821
What's wrong?

210
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,867
I promise
I will have him there. I guarantee it.

211
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,410
First thing tomorrow at the Embassy.

212
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,538
- I'm offering a compromise.
- I'm sorry.

213
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,414
I don't have the authority to negotiate.

214
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,876
That's a tough spot to be in. I know.

215
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,128
Been in that spot many times.

216
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,130
There's no reason
why this can't run smoothly.

217
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,048
I just don't see that happening.

218
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,342
- Does he know the situation here?
- I've explained it.

219
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,804
Mr. Riley is not here this evening
in a supervisory capacity.

220
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,140
We thought he might be able
to get the man out quietly.

221
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,182
"Man"?

222
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,309
This is a 13-year-old boy
we're talking about.

223
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,061
This child is harmless.

224
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,814
This is not an analysis assignment.

225
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,651
If you can't help me find
a creative solution to my problem,

226
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,737
then I'm gonna ask you
to telephone someone who can.

227
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,282
We've lost that as an option.

228
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,660
Then I suggest you retrace your steps
and figure out where...

229
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,414
Jesus! Get out...

230
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,957
Wait! Mas!

231
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,626
Mason! Hold it.

232
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,300
Watch out! Watch out!

233
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,761
Mason! Nadia!

234
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,929
Karim!

235
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,015
Nadia!

236
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,516
Karim!

237
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,475
Nadia!

238
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,437
Move!

239
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,439
Get him out!

240
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,065
Help me, Mason!

241
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,944
Mason!

242
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,571
No!

243
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,115
No! Please!

244
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
Take me!

245
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,619
Leave her!

246
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,705
Drop your weapon!

247
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,875
Come here, Karim!

248
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,336
- No!
- Mason!

249
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,798
Karim.

250
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,636
Drop your weapon!
Or I kill her.

251
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,768
Please, no!

252
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,065
Please!

253
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,201
Go! Go!

254
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:33,044
No, baby. No, baby. Come on.
Stay here with me.

255
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,946
Don't leave home
without that raincoat.

256
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,698
You are going to need it.

257
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,450
Showers will continue in the Boston area
throughout the evening,

258
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,786
tapering off just after rush hour.

259
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,872
And that's your traffic and weather
on WCPN.

260
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,583
It's 7:15. I'm Jane Emerson.

261
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,254
Coming up in the next half hour,
Jerry Torbin discusses the future...

262
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,843
Hey, buddy!

263
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,221
You all right in there?

264
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,516
Yes... Yes, sir!

265
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,603
Well, you don't sound so sure.
Coming or going?

266
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,315
No, I'm here. I'm a guest
at the hotel. I was just heading in.

267
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,320
All right. Try sleeping inside.

268
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,740
All right, issue number five,
pension attrition ratio.

269
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,992
We worked our way to common ground here.

270
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,996
Jerry's gonna accept the National Formula
and the Union has decided to waive

271
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,874
their "most favored nations" clause.
Great.

272
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,710
Number six, ICC indemnity bonding.

273
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,171
Feels like another solid compromise here.

274
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,549
We'll cross-collateralize the premiums
with the safety bonuses.

275
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:49,764
So, we have fewer accidents, fewer claims.
We have a better package. Everybody wins.

276
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,099
All right, guys?

277
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,395
That is six issues
we've taken off the table.

278
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,355
It's important now to take a look back

279
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,856
and realize how far we've come.

280
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,233
Six of ten.

281
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,484
Of nine.

282
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,860
You see?

283
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,863
You're back with the overtime?
Again with this?

284
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,490
It's never going on the table.

285
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,284
Both sides have to show
more cards here. All right?

286
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,370
The numbers will tell us
which way we're gonna go.

287
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,288
I'm getting raped here, Mason.

288
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,625
- Prove it. Open your books!
- Open your fucking ears. I'm done.

289
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,669
I'm going back to the office
and starting over.

290
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,421
What do you mean by "starting over"?

291
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,964
I'm going back to my original offer.

292
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,341
- Is that a threat?
- No. Here's a threat.

293
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,261
I'm gonna start answering my phone,
'cause it's ringing off the hook

294
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,889
with guys who would kill to work
for what I paid you thieves 20 years ago.

295
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,850
You don't got the balls
to lock us out!

296
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,685
- Let's take a break.
- Try me.

297
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,854
I can have a strike vote
in 15 minutes.

298
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:38,938
Bring it on!

299
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,648
Let's see this strike!

300
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,824
Fuck you, you piece of fuckin'...
Do you know what? Kiss my fuckin' fat ass!

301
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,576
That went well.

302
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,288
They'll cool off.
The deal speaks for itself.

303
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,417
Let them sit with it a bit,
let the downside ring in their ears.

304
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,377
In a couple of days, they'll be back.

305
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,338
Where do we stand
with the supermarket thing in Providence?

306
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,592
They took a local guy. A lawyer.

307
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,510
I was gonna tell you this morning,

308
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,554
but it seemed like
you had a lot on your plate.

309
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,764
Can I buy you a drink at Foley's?

310
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,725
I've been offered a job.

311
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,394
It's New York.

312
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,106
We're still haggling
over the numbers, but...

313
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,694
That's not why I want to wrap things up.
I'm not bailing on you.

314
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,406
You need a rest, Mas.

315
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,909
Like, for real.

316
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,621
Get some sun. Walk around. Take a break.

317
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,416
You're gonna do great in New York, Ernie.

318
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,627
You'll be fine.

319
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,022
Colonel Ruzak.

320
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,612
...sanctions.

321
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,575
It's confirmed. They found the car.

322
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,706
- Pack your bag.
- It's in my office, sir.

323
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,762
Mason?

324
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,973
Mason Skiles?

325
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,686
You might not remember me. Ray Sullivan?

326
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,312
Sure.

327
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,941
You arbitrated a barter for us
a couple years back.

328
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,569
A fiber optics project down in Needham?

329
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,614
Sully. Of course. Of course.

330
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,783
- How are you? I'm sorry.
- No. Relax.

331
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,119
Happens to me ten times a day.
Who can keep track?

332
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,748
Yeah. We're just here
negotiating labor settlements.

333
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,919
Just killing time
while both sides cool down a little bit.

334
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,965
I know. I spoke to your partner.
He told me you might be here.

335
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,052
I got a wake-up call this morning.
Kind of a fire alarm.

336
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,223
Friends in Washington. Old friends.
Well, mutual friends.

337
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,311
They know I'm in the area
and they asked me to talk to you.

338
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,647
American University in Beirut.

339
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,734
I guess they had someone lined up
to give a lecture later this week,

340
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,027
and he canceled on them.

341
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,488
"Cross-Cultural Arbitration"
was the topic.

342
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,617
So, my friends, your credentials,
your being an alumni and all,

343
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,201
they were hoping you might fill in.

344
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,704
There's a check.

345
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,334
$6,500 and a first-class ticket.

346
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,212
I wouldn't go back to Beirut
if it was the last place on earth.

347
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,007
Flight leaves Logan at 8:45 tonight.

348
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,929
It sounds like you got about six hours
to find somebody else.

349
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,682
I was told that's not an option.

350
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,810
Look, I have no idea
what's happening here.

351
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,522
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
for both of us if I did.

352
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,276
But I was told to tell you that

353
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,404
time is extremely tight

354
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,285
and the agency would be deeply grateful
for your cooperation.

355
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,080
It's a serious request. They know that.

356
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,833
Tell 'em I don't have a passport.

357
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,835
They put one in with the ticket.

358
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,344
Great seeing you, Ray.

359
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,181
Do me a favor, will ya?

360
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,394
You miss the flight, this never happened.

361
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,706
This is the last message I'm leaving,

362
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,082
because this is bullshit.

363
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,753
Dennis called a strike about an hour ago.
Maybe you know that.

364
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:18,342
I'm in New York. Pam has my keys.
I don't know what else to say.

365
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,803
You wanna talk, you know where to find me.

366
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,902
Mason Francis Skiles.

367
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,696
45 years old.

368
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,699
Postgrad at Oxford
in Arabic and Mideast studies.

369
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,536
He comes here in 1962
on a teaching fellowship.

370
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,083
He's recruited Foreign Service in '63
for immediate posting to Cairo.

371
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,170
Then Damascus, '65, Tel Aviv '68.

372
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,173
1969, he's reassigned to DC

373
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,967
as assistant undersecretary
for Mideast Affairs.

374
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,847
He marries. He's published.
He's widely quoted.

375
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,475
Kissinger takes a shine to him,

376
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,852
throws him a working group
at the Paris peace talks.

377
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,023
And in '71 he jumps the line.
He comes back to Beirut,

378
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,734
where he was appointed
deputy chief of mission here.

379
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,780
And his wife... I guess Don
ran that by you on the ride in.

380
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,115
The incident at Skiles' house in '72?

381
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,826
His wife and the Abu Rajal brothers?

382
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,453
I can read, Ms. Crowder.

383
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,164
What I need to know is
where he stands now.

384
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,294
Well, he left Beirut in '73
before the civil war kicked in.

385
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,839
He was the senior trade negotiator
for the Boston Merchandising Council,

386
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,133
and then he left there three years ago
to go private.

387
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,428
And now he just has
this small two-man firm.

388
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,013
Mostly local labor issues.

389
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,393
So, from Kissinger to the crapper.

390
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,313
Mm-hmm.
He has a drinking problem.

391
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,273
Christ. How bad?

392
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,150
They had to pour him
on to the plane.

393
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,072
Like we've got time for this nonsense.
Talk to me, Don.

394
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,115
He's damaged goods.

395
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,827
Front-runner who stumbled.

396
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,496
But he's manageable.

397
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,792
Frank? You knew him when.

398
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,671
Don't play cards with him, Gary.

399
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,023
Take it easy.

400
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,992
Mr. Skiles!

401
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,035
Mr. Skiles!

402
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,835
Bernard Teppler. American University.
Absolute pleasure to have you here.

403
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,503
Let me take...

404
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,178
Welcome to Beirut.

405
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,181
We're thrilled to have you here.
Let me take that for you.

406
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,854
I'll be your liaison
with the university.

407
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,397
Get you where you need to get.

408
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,109
Beirut's changed quite a bit
in the past ten years.

409
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,028
You missed quite the civil war.

410
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,531
My itinerary says I'm staying
at the L'Admiral Hotel.

411
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,909
Yes, indeed.
We've booked you the deluxe suite.

412
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,995
On the shelling side, I'm afraid.
Beachside was full.

413
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,914
Why aren't we taking Rue Du Nabil?
It's faster.

414
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,208
Rue Du Nabil's not good today.

415
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,003
Big car bomb last night.
Many people killed.

416
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,504
Who lit that fuse?

417
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,633
Well, it's Beirut,
Mr. Skiles. Depends who you ask.

418
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,678
PLO says it's Amal militia.
Amal militia says it's Christian militia.

419
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:53,098
Christian militia says it's the Druze.
Druze says it's the Syrian Army.

420
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,059
Listen to the radio from Damascus,

421
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,228
it's the Israelis making excuses
to come across the border.

422
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,939
Ask Israel...
Ah, for them it's always the PLO.

423
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,610
Not the PLO. My wife says
it was Gamaeet El Cheea.

424
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,278
What do you say?

425
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,489
I say we skip Rue Du Nabil.

426
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,620
They're checking papers, sir.

427
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,164
Oh, fuck it.
I'm afraid I'll need your passport.

428
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,542
Nothing to worry about.
PLO run a decent checkpoint.

429
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,760
- Passport.
- Hold on.

430
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,679
Welcome to the Green Line.

431
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,306
This road divides
East and West Beirut now.

432
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,351
One of the civil war's
charming new landmarks.

433
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,646
Muslims to the West.
Christians to the East.

434
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,899
Not much room for the rest of us,
but there you have it.

435
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,235
Thank you! Thank you so much.

436
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,659
Shit.

437
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,895
â™ª ...till it hurts â™ª

438
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:08,400
â™ª I know you hurt, too
But what else can we do â™ª

439
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:12,112
â™ª Tormented and torn apart â™ª

440
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:17,326
â™ª I wish I could carry your smile
In my heart... â™ª

441
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,287
Monsieur. S'il vous plait?

442
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:26,043
â™ª It would make me believe
What tomorrow could bring â™ª

443
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,004
â™ª When today doesn't really know â™ª

444
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,966
â™ª Doesn't really know â™ª

445
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,677
â™ª I'm all out of love... â™ª

446
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:40,599
Mr. Skiles? Mr. Skiles?
Hi. I'm Sandy Crowder.

447
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,811
I'm the deputy cultural attachÃ©
at the Embassy.

448
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,395
So nice to meet you.

449
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,107
What a surprise.

450
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,775
I help out at the university sometimes.

451
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,902
They told me you were here
for the lectures.

452
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,656
- I know you just got in...
- Yeah. No, I just... Please. Please.

453
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,574
No, I left my car out front.

454
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,743
Perhaps you'd like to get out
of the hotel?

455
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,622
Oh. You know what?

456
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,792
That's funny. I was just thinking
I could use a tour guide.

457
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,126
- Really?
- No.

458
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,379
So why don't we stand here and pretend

459
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,133
while you tell me what kind of trouble
I've gotten myself into.

460
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,178
The ambassador's hosting
a recital this evening,

461
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,013
and I was thinking of stopping in.

462
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:24,101
You're just gonna keep smiling at me
no matter what I say, right?

463
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,104
Why don't I meet you out front?

464
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,839
Good God. Mason.

465
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,465
Ambassador Whalen.

466
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,385
It's shocking, I'm sure.

467
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,721
Good seeing you, Frank.

468
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,099
I seriously doubt that,
but I appreciate the effort.

469
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,768
Congratulations on all this.

470
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,687
Now I know you're fucking with me.

471
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,024
Why don't you go and find Don?
We'll be right up.

472
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,319
- Uh, flight good?
- Good enough.

473
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,237
You get a look around?

474
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,907
- Yeah. What's left of it.
- Breaks your heart?

475
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,910
I tell you, Mason.
You missed one hell of a fight.

476
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,746
PLO started tossing bombs.
Government pushed back.

477
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,080
Israel got involved.

478
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,417
And what did we get? 50,000 dead.

479
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,962
City carved up like a goddamn pizza.

480
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,549
And the PLO, they're still here,
hoping the cease-fire holds.

481
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,594
'Cause now we've got Israel
down the road licking their chops,

482
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:45,098
looking for an excuse to drive up
and show us what great weapons we got 'em.

483
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,310
- Mason Skiles, uh, Colonel Gary Ruzak.
- Nice to see you.

484
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,854
- National Security Council.
- How you doing?

485
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:55,442
- Um, thirsty?
- Sure. Uh, bourbon. Neat.

486
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,403
Before we get started,

487
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,698
I want you to know we're all
keenly aware of what you've done.

488
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:03,951
And what is that?

489
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,580
Coming out here. No notice. No info.
It's been duly noted.

490
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:15,087
I think you know Don Gaines,
our chief political officer here.

491
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,129
Been a while.

492
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,422
Long time.

493
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,883
Here you go. Have a seat.

494
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,975
Okay.

495
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,939
Wow. Two spies, the White House
and an ambassador.

496
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,610
Maybe one of you can actually tell me
what I'm doing here.

497
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,614
Have you talked to anybody
in the area recently?

498
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,700
- No.
- You had a lot of friends here.

499
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,202
- You must keep in touch with some?
- No.

500
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,079
A phone call? Christmas card?

501
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,291
- Where we going with this?
- It's a simple question.

502
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,419
Who's in charge here?

503
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,212
We all serve the president.

504
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,881
Unless he's the next one
to pop through that door,

505
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,509
why don't you step up
and tell me what the fuck's going on.

506
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,559
Three nights ago, an American
was pulled off the street in West Beirut.

507
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,103
The next morning, we got a communiquÃ©

508
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,064
from a group calling itself
the Militia of Islamic Liberation.

509
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,817
Very clean. No rhetoric.

510
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,153
They have the guy, they wanna talk.

511
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,822
They want you to broker the deal.

512
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,826
They asked for you specifically.

513
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,536
Who would do that?

514
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,996
We know who it's not.

515
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,373
It's not mainstream PLO.

516
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,417
- That's a minority opinion.
- Come on.

517
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,503
The last thing they want is Israeli tanks
rolling across the border.

518
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,172
They won't risk something like this.

519
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,884
Right now, we're not ruling out anyone.
Everything is in play.

520
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,429
What is it you want me to do?

521
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,641
You're an experienced negotiator.
Negotiate.

522
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,645
I'm here because some lunatic
pulled my name out of a hat.

523
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,940
Your kidnappers clearly wanna make a deal.

524
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,319
They got back fast. They're responsive.
They're specific.

525
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,112
You have something that they want.

526
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,239
Call their bluff. Tell them I'm out.

527
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,617
Let the downside of that
ring in their ears for a while.

528
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,245
If they bite, great.
You have your first concession.

529
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:17,459
Honestly, I'm a little surprised.
I thought I'd see Cal here tonight.

530
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,880
Cal Riley?

531
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,716
Cal's the hostage.

532
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,640
You guys were pretty close.

533
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,558
When's the last time you talked to him?

534
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,395
Jesus. Uh...

535
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,731
Ten years ago? I...

536
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,776
Radio silence? Nothing?

537
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,278
Yeah, no. Yeah.

538
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,406
We believe Cal requested you.

539
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,490
Based on what?

540
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,033
Nothing specific, but...

541
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,410
No, no, no, no, no...

542
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,704
No, I don't see that happening.

543
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:55,747
Cal's my CO.

544
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,084
We run half the agency's
Mideast operation off this desk.

545
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,336
Do you understand what that means?

546
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,131
Yeah. You're afraid he'll talk.

547
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,048
Afraid?

548
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,551
He's been here 13 years.
The guy's a walking playbook.

549
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,554
- At the moment nothing's blown.
- That we know of.

550
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,307
This goes bad, we don't even know
where to begin wrapping up.

551
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,601
We're playing the waiting game.
It's their move.

552
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,522
So, the question I need answered
from you right now is...

553
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:26,153
can we count on you to play along
until we get our feet on the ground?

554
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,616
So, here's our story.
We never mention Cal.

555
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,327
He's on assignment,
and nobody needs to know.

556
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:38,039
Ruzak doesn't arrive in Beirut
till tomorrow, so you've never met him.

557
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,416
We brought you here tonight

558
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,085
because we wanted to find out
what you're doing in town.

559
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,087
This isn't really my thing,
Gaines.

560
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,298
Sure it is. It's Texas Hold 'em.

561
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,135
Two cards down,
and everything else is on the table.

562
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,679
Just play the reality.

563
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:58,977
You're a confused 40-year-old widower
in the middle of a long winter.

564
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,062
You're pretending to give a lecture,

565
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:05,442
but the truth is you don't really know
what you're doing or why you came.

566
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,526
Reality.

567
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:11,072
Your name appears out of nowhere,
and we get real nervous. Reality.

568
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:16,620
We roll you up for a look,
and you resent our interest. Reality.

569
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,747
So, I'm leaving here pissed off?

570
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,832
Works for me.

571
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,542
What about Ms. Crowder?

572
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,420
Well, it's a widely held belief

573
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,257
that dangling a skirt in front
of a jet-lagged American man of your age

574
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,842
is a high percentage play.

575
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,346
We done here?

576
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,016
You suddenly became really important.

577
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,601
Is that a mistake?

578
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,231
I don't know. Reality.

579
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,737
Gaines was just testing you.

580
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,989
Everyone's under a lot of pressure.

581
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,952
- Isn't that what you're after?
- What's that supposed to mean?

582
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,454
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for the action, right?

583
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,123
- You think I'm here for the thrills?
- I don't know.

584
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,126
No, you don't.

585
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,923
All right, fine. Enlighten me.
What's your story, Ms. Crowder?

586
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,510
I'm a skirt in a car driving
an irritated tourist back to his hotel.

587
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,685
Hey, can we take a quick detour?

588
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,021
To where?

589
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,191
I'll show you
where I used to live.

590
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,575
Wow.

591
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,587
The PLO had a transmitter up here.

592
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,008
Ten months ago, just before
the cease-fire, the Israelis took it out.

593
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,802
Must have been beautiful.

594
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,305
It sure was.

595
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,183
In every way.

596
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,271
Ski in the morning, swim in the afternoon,
party all night?

597
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,731
No, not just that.

598
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,818
What we were doing
was what we wanted to do.

599
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,823
We were happy.

600
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,705
I'm not sure how that turned into this.

601
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,916
I'm good.

602
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,961
Cal still with Alice?

603
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,423
As far as I know, yeah.

604
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,218
- So, where is she?
- They have an apartment in Athens.

605
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,055
Alice moved there with the family
when the fighting started.

606
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,475
Cal stayed in Beirut.
It's impossible with kids here.

607
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,644
She knows I'm involved?

608
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,729
I'm not sure Gaines has told her yet.

609
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,690
- We should head out.
- Hold on. Wait, wait.

610
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,443
What's your take on all this? Honestly.

611
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,614
Do you think they want to save Cal
or the information?

612
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,740
That's an ugly question.

613
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,325
You must have thought about it.

614
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,536
I'm too busy worrying whether you're
gonna come through for us or not.

615
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,500
Okay, fine. Just pretend for a minute
that I'm actually gonna do my job.

616
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,584
Who am I working for?

617
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,837
The White House? The State Department?
Don Gaines?

618
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:13,922
Make Cal your client.

619
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,635
Unless you blame him
for what happened here.

620
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,512
Is that what it says in my file?

621
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,432
Listen, we all fucked up here.

622
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,185
Every one of us.

623
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,061
Shoot, double up.

624
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,077
It'll be transported to Paris.

625
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,290
I gotta tell you, Mas,

626
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,377
Alice has been pretty adamant
about going to the service.

627
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,882
I'll call you when I get there.

628
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:25,345
If not now, then maybe we'll do
something later, stateside.

629
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,513
You can tell her that.

630
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:34,229
I keep thinking that I can take this.

631
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,899
- You're gonna be fine.
- Bullshit.

632
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,948
Sooner or later, you're gonna realize
that none of this was your fault.

633
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,493
Every time you say that, it cuts me.

634
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,745
Then I'll stop saying it.

635
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,877
- Take care of yourself, Cal.
- Hey, Mas...

636
00:38:58,837 --> 00:38:59,796
Mason.

637
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,341
Mason!

638
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:13,393
Mason.

639
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,188
Mr. Skiles.

640
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,567
Mr. Skiles.

641
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,570
Mr. Skiles, good morning to you, sir.

642
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,669
Bloody traffic!
Look, we're already late. She's waiting.

643
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:45,967
Look, uh, it's the blue Renault
across the street there.

644
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,552
Can you see it? Right there.

645
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:48,970
Off you pop.

646
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:51,472
All right.

647
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:55,768
Mr. Skiles!

648
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,020
Quick as you can.

649
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,617
No, no, no, no, no, no.

650
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,927
Are you fucking kidding?

651
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,053
What?

652
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,055
I'm talking about the card game.

653
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,806
I was told to act naturally.

654
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,516
Well, Bashir, your new friend...

655
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,517
The host?

656
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,728
He's the PLO Minister of Commerce.

657
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,482
I didn't get a revolutionary vibe off him.

658
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,192
He's a long way from the homeland.

659
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,194
He's got a house in Spain
and a condo in Sidon

660
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,862
and a Belgian hooker named Sandrine

661
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,490
he keeps in a luxury apartment
in Rue Hamra.

662
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,700
- How the hell does that work?
- The airlines.

663
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,410
He's pulling over a million a month,

664
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,997
'cause he's the guy who guarantees the PLO
won't blow your plane out of the sky.

665
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,084
You mind telling me
where you're taking me?

666
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,587
The kidnappers called at 6:00 a.m.
They know you're here. They want to meet.

667
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,842
Sent a comm signal out
about 20 minutes ago,

668
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,636
we just got called back.

669
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,180
We've got four million in cash
in the Embassy safe.

670
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,890
There's a Naval cruiser stationed offshore

671
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,642
with a SEAL team on standby.

672
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,104
We've got approval
to retarget the observation satellites.

673
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,855
We've got all the pieces in place.

674
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,525
We just gotta hope there's somebody
worth talking to. Let's go.

675
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,486
You all right?
You look a little jet-lagged.

676
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,113
I'm fine.

677
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,077
All right, let's go.

678
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,642
It's the Syrian Air Force.

679
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,688
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing there.

680
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,316
Shit getting closer, though.

681
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,030
Hey! Don't move! Don't move!

682
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,491
Don't move! No, no, no.

683
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,371
We send in four of ours.
We hold four of theirs.

684
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,791
We finish, we go back the way we came.

685
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:10,004
All right. We're playing by ear
from here on out, Mason.

686
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,839
Follow our lead, we'll be fine.

687
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,509
Gaines does the talking. Understand?

688
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,346
- Just another pretty face.
- All right, let's go.

689
00:43:58,678 --> 00:43:59,679
Sit.

690
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,557
We've been waiting.

691
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,060
He says they've been waiting.

692
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,206
How may we be sure
that this man is alive?

693
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,666
You will trust in my word.

694
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,001
Which one of you is Skiles?

695
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,628
Now he's asking who's Skiles?

696
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,505
Tell him this isn't much to go on.

697
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,341
We are concerned that the...

698
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,428
My question remains unanswered!

699
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,430
I'm Skiles.

700
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,807
I am curious...

701
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,934
My friends are curious.

702
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:50,605
How is it that I can help
where others cannot?

703
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,939
No, no, no, no!

704
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,649
I'm not here to answer questions.

705
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,527
I'm here to tell you what must happen.

706
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,946
- I ask the questions.
- Sir...

707
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,408
Demands can be thrown
through the Embassy window.

708
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,327
We've come to hear your voice.

709
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,703
And to let you hear ours.

710
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,330
My voice?

711
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,665
These men should speak!

712
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,876
This man saw his mother
and sister blown up

713
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,629
two days ago at Barjesh Kjehelem.

714
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,924
Do you know that sound?

715
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:22,261
The sound of American bombs
falling from Zionist planes.

716
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:25,264
Perhaps you should ask him
what it is he needs!

717
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,223
Sir!

718
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,600
Enough!

719
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,770
So... Tell us. Tell us.

720
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,067
What is the price of our man's freedom?

721
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,068
The price?

722
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,738
Where do you think you are, the souk?

723
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,740
You think
we're selling you lipstick?

724
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:46,202
Yes, Saiyid!
The market is now open for business.

725
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,578
Come in! Come in!

726
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,045
- What have you done?
- Don't question me.

727
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,923
Everything okay in there?

728
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,008
Take him out of here.

729
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,765
It's okay.

730
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,853
Everyone stay where they're at.

731
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,814
Everything is okay!

732
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,692
Okay, we'll stand by. Okay.

733
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,073
I apologize.

734
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,868
My friend was old.

735
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,039
He was confused by... anger.

736
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:38,504
I know when we speak to America,
we need clarity.

737
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:43,217
We need to choose word carefully.

738
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,932
You agree, Mr. Skiles?

739
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,147
Have I changed so much?

740
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,358
What the hell is this?

741
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,652
You know this guy?

742
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,155
Yes, I do.

743
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,741
Karim.

744
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,118
Karim Abu Rajal.

745
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,078
You look older.

746
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,329
So do you.

747
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,167
I apologize for the circumstance.

748
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,960
I'm afraid we don't have
a lot of time here.

749
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,463
- You're apologizing a lot.
- Jesus Christ.

750
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,214
- What do you want?
- What the fuck?

751
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,716
You're gonna let that man fuck us?

752
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,800
My brother.

753
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,470
Rafid Abu Rajal.

754
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,889
He is known to you.

755
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,807
Yes.

756
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:35,061
I will trade Cal Riley
for the return of my brother.

757
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,147
What makes you think we have your brother?

758
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,524
Not you. Israel.

759
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,151
Why come to us?

760
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,528
Why go to the son
when the father is so close?

761
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:50,701
You're saying the Israelis have Abu Rajal
in custody and they're keeping it quiet?

762
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,661
I think we would know
something about that.

763
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,706
He was with friend at the border
in the south. Now he's missing.

764
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,708
You understand my offer?

765
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,044
Yes. Straight up, Cal for your brother.

766
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,254
I've explained my terms.

767
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,217
- Wait.
- Describe Cal's condition.

768
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:07,885
Alive.

769
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,429
- How do we contact you?
- I trade only with Mr. Skiles.

770
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,347
Why?

771
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,182
Because he doesn't trust you, either.

772
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,727
Hold on a minute.
What if they're not lying?

773
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,731
If they can't find your brother,
come up with an alternative.

774
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,066
Alternative?

775
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,986
This is alternative.

776
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,490
A, they killed him
and haven't told us yet.

777
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,908
For chrissakes, it's Israel.

778
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,952
B, they killed him
and don't know it.

779
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,079
C, they have him and don't know it.

780
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,164
He's been picked up
but hasn't been ID'd yet.

781
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,375
The guy they've been hunting
the last ten years?

782
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,502
- I don't think so.
- D, he's hiding.

783
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,296
He's been driven so deep,
his own people don't know where he is.

784
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,009
E, F, G, they have him in Tel Aviv
in a cage with a little socket in his ear.

785
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,219
Does it even matter?

786
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,555
You think if they have him,
they'll just let him out,

787
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,557
so he can blow up
another bus full of Israelis?

788
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,100
You got your checkbook.

789
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,687
It's Abu Rajal. Are you kidding me?
He's Munich!

790
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,147
There's always a number.

791
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,439
Never happen.

792
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,607
It's worth a meeting.

793
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,527
And say what? Tell them about Cal?
We do that and he's blown.

794
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,029
We don't say anything,
go in, drop a bomb, see what happens.

795
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,656
Come on, get me a meeting in Israel.

796
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,866
Wait a minute...

797
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,576
You know I can do things you can't.

798
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,203
I don't have to be here
when this blows up. I can play hard.

799
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,165
These are our friends.
You're over your fucking head.

800
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,958
- Okay.
- You're over your head.

801
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,627
What's Cal's value on the open market?
That some big secret?

802
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,297
You think Karim is the only one
that knows he hit the jackpot here?

803
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,966
How long do you think
he holds that gang together?

804
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,844
How long before one of those guys
gets ambitious

805
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,430
or pissed off
or does something sloppy or stupid?

806
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,849
I'm sorry, right now your only problem

807
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,059
is getting the Abu Rajal brothers
back together.

808
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,562
And whether Rafid blows up another bus

809
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,857
is something you'll need
to worry about later, after Cal is safe.

810
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,444
You don't have time to be polite,
and you cannot afford to be predictable.

811
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:52,948
You need cards to play,
and you need them right now.

812
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,784
So, unless someone else has a better idea,

813
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,829
I say we go rattle the Israelis
before they can stonewall us.

814
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,126
I'm sorry, this is a waste of time.

815
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,921
Rafid Abu Rajal? Seriously?

816
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,174
- What's going on here, Gary?
- I don't...

817
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,593
If you don't have him,
it doesn't really matter, does it?

818
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:17,806
I think it's safe to say that if we knew
where he was, he'd be dead.

819
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,935
And we're saying that he might be
worth more to us alive.

820
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,231
- Why?
- We're not here to say why.

821
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,400
We're just here
to see if the market's open.

822
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,114
Is this about you looking
for the man who killed your wife?

823
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,746
- Would that get the ball rolling?
- There's no ball.

824
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,583
You came all the way here just for this?

825
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,918
- No.
- Okay. Hold on.

826
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,544
Hypothetically...

827
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,046
Just for fun...

828
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,423
Let's say you did have him.

829
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,385
What would it take?
What's on your wish list?

830
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,387
Sky is the limit.

831
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,015
I'm sorry, Gary.

832
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,978
Someday you're gonna have to tell me
what this was all about.

833
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,817
I must be out of my mind
for bringing you here.

834
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,734
Relax!

835
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,861
I can't even think
of all the ways this is fucked.

836
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,280
They're coming back to us.

837
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:17,574
These are people
I have to deal with every day, Mason.

838
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,494
We're not done yet here, Gary.

839
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,912
Are you drunk or delusional?

840
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,039
We're in play. You need to be ready.

841
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,337
- Back to the airport.
- Yes, sir.

842
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,173
The curiosity's driving your buddy crazy.

843
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,925
You are. You're delusional.

844
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,135
Okay. Put up or shut up.

845
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,761
I say they call before we take off.

846
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,888
If I'm wrong, I'm off your back.

847
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,934
I'm right, in the next meeting,
the one they throw me out of,

848
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,103
you're gonna stick around
and close the deal.

849
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,147
I'm begging you to shut the fuck up.

850
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,775
- Mr. Ruzak?
- Yeah?

851
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,569
There's a call for you.

852
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,991
Munich Olympics.

853
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,704
Madrid. 16 Israeli tourists.

854
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,836
A synagogue in Istanbul.
14 victims. Children.

855
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:17,509
El Al flight 305. 46 dead. Families.

856
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,555
All of this, Rafid Abu Rajal.

857
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,230
So how much?

858
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,109
We know what we're asking.
We don't know the price.

859
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,071
If we had him, we would never let him go.

860
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,823
That's a tough opening.

861
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,033
Is this man deaf?

862
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:45,120
- I think we're off the track.
- It's a simple question. How much?

863
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,205
We never said we had him.

864
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:50,834
- Then what are we doing here?
- No! What the hell are you doing here?

865
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,003
Wait for me.

866
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,838
Wait for me.

867
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,575
- Hypothetically...
- They have him.

868
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,329
Eh. They won't say.
They're gonna take another look.

869
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,749
He might be "lost" in the system.

870
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:35,712
I think they have him.
I think they have him.

871
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:36,922
What do they want?

872
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,592
You mean other than to make sure
you're not involved?

873
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,638
Syria has antiaircraft bunkers
all over the Bekaa Valley.

874
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,766
Half of them are decoys.
They want better satellite imaging.

875
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,518
That's it?

876
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,355
Two dozen Syrian targets
they don't have eyes on?

877
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,276
Take my word, it's a major piece
of strategic intelligence.

878
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,820
Did you tell them it was Cal,
or did they already know?

879
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:06,618
Did you really think
they were gonna make a blind deal?

880
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,371
Of course I told them.

881
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,665
This isn't the New England
Chamber of Commerce.

882
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,709
You've got us in there

883
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,753
playing good cop, bad cop
with the World Heavyweight Champions.

884
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:21,592
Look, we got lucky, okay?
But that's the end of the flimflam.

885
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,470
From here on out,
you're our spokesman to Karim.

886
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,555
That's it. End of story.

887
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:33,687
Now, this is bullshit up and down!

888
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,983
Syrian bunkers, my ass.
Those are Russian-built installations.

889
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,318
We're running out of time.

890
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,237
- Are you kidding me?
- They just want the imaging!

891
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,072
Here you go.

892
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,283
Thank you.

893
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,335
Don't say a word.

894
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,716
You're talking
about jeopardizing US-Soviet relations.

895
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,011
That's why
Washington's gonna be making decisions.

896
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,515
We spoke with the minister, Frank.
He was very direct.

897
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:12,643
They give us Abu Rajal,
we give them satellite pictures...

898
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,728
Those pictures are the only thing

899
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,606
keeping the Israelis
from crossing the border.

900
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,732
Little dramatic.

901
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,484
You take away those rockets

902
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:24,446
and the Israeli Air Force does
whatever they want to up here.

903
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,031
You give them that intel,

904
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,493
we might as well hand the PLO
their life preservers tonight.

905
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,955
- You think Riley's worth that?
- Come on, guys.

906
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,332
- Are you serious?
- You like this, don't you, Gary?

907
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,459
Two birds? One stone?

908
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,879
You've been trying to push
an Israeli invasion along for months.

909
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,549
You might want to check with your boss.

910
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,593
- I'm not the Christmas help.
- I'll be calling the Secretary.

911
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,388
- Do what you have to do.
- Count on it.

912
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,267
See what you been missing around here?

913
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,270
We're putting a plan in place.

914
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,606
Well, we're in play. That's the good news.

915
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,233
Let's see what comes back.

916
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,861
Did you get a chance to tell him?

917
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,658
Alice is in town.
She flew in from Athens this morning.

918
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,077
She's obviously upset.

919
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,331
She's gone back to their old apartment,
which is no longer a safe neighborhood.

920
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,796
We need to get her out of there.

921
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,811
He's on his way.

922
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,414
Ma'am, Skiles is here.

923
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,340
Alice.

924
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,318
If that's for me...

925
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,779
No?

926
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,616
It's warm anyway.

927
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,079
They've had the electricity off all day.

928
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,749
Don Gaines told me you were an alcoholic.

929
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,543
Guess that makes sense.

930
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,380
God knows what he says about me.

931
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:54,137
I know it's a lot to take in right now.

932
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,516
I know they want me out of here.

933
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,893
You've got the girls to think about.

934
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,231
You say that as if you know them.

935
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,320
The girls are fine.
They're living with my parents...

936
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,824
in blissful ignorance of all things adult.

937
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,578
Do you think Cal's still alive?

938
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,456
I do.

939
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:27,587
People seem very motivated.

940
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,756
How they seem? In Beirut?

941
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,011
Most of the people you're talking to
would love to see him disappear.

942
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,054
People like who?

943
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,932
Cal thought he'd earned the right
to have an opinion.

944
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,562
You'd think someone with so many secrets
would be able to keep their mouth shut.

945
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,189
- About what?
- Seriously?

946
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,358
Israel will fail here.

947
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:52,320
They'll drown,
like everyone who came before them.

948
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,573
Just don't dare say it out loud.

949
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,034
- Is that what he's done?
- Oh, for chrissake.

950
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,828
Look, Alice, I'm doing everything I can.

951
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,997
- To do what?
- To save him.

952
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,624
Well, you've proven you can crush him.

953
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,544
Bringing him back to life
may be a little harder.

954
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,508
Oh, God, this place.

955
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,969
Staying here...

956
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,556
All the things we might've done.

957
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,186
We could've gone anywhere.

958
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,607
You, know, I think really, in the end,

959
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,819
he's been waiting for you to come back
and tell him it's okay to leave.

960
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,572
And here you are.

961
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,283
But it's too late.

962
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,204
You can tell them I'm leaving tonight.

963
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,872
And you owe me a favor.

964
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,043
When you left Beirut, I packed your house.

965
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:53,381
Dishes, papers, Nadia's clothes,
all of it...

966
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:58,136
Cal doesn't make it out of here,
you pack this place up for me.

967
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,638
I think that's fair.

968
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,189
She's ready to go.

969
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:13,193
- He's on his way down.
- Copy.

970
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,874
Monsieur Skiles.

971
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,931
Come, come!

972
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,017
We don't have a lot of time.

973
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,023
He's on his way?

974
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,317
Yeah.
He's coming to you.

975
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,947
Mason?

976
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:01,825
Mason?

977
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,808
He disappeared. Let's move.

978
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,395
Slow down!

979
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,690
Get her out of there right now.

980
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,026
Fuck.

981
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,824
Slow down.

982
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,329
Follow me!

983
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,131
No, no further.

984
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,384
Stop!

985
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,304
Stop!

986
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:06,556
Stop!

987
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,482
No.

988
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,777
Get in!

989
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,007
You went to Israel.

990
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:44,010
Yes, Karim, they said maybe they have him.

991
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,971
- So, now we're waiting.
- What? Maybe?

992
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,055
You wait for them?

993
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,848
Bullshit! You wait for nothing!

994
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,393
- You... Shut up!
- We are trying. They know it's important.

995
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,605
You have to tell them to make it work!

996
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:59,150
Karim, I got back two hours ago!
We are trying.

997
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,485
Find a stop.

998
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,362
- I need to see Cal.
- Impossible.

999
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,447
I need to see Cal and speak to him.

1000
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,615
Find Rafid first.

1001
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,951
- If I had your brother, I'd let you talk.
- Impossible.

1002
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,828
It's only impossible if he's dead.

1003
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,205
Get out.

1004
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,100
Are you kidding me?
I'm supposed to trust you now?

1005
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,334
Get out!

1006
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,044
You're the reason I'm here!

1007
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,715
I gave my life up to protect you!

1008
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:25,427
Get out!

1009
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:29,764
Listen to me very closely
if you want to see your brother again.

1010
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,684
I don't make a move until I talk to Cal.

1011
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,957
We don't have him.

1012
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:58,877
What?

1013
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,670
- We looked.
- No.

1014
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,547
We don't have him.

1015
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,053
- The wheels are in motion, Roni.
- Oh, we should worry?

1016
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:11,222
You wait three days to tell us
Cal Riley is a hostage?

1017
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,725
What if he talks?
We might have people in danger now.

1018
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,228
Without Abu Rajal,
this doesn't give me many options.

1019
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,523
- Work with what you have.
- And what do I have? Say it.

1020
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,942
You had the whole ride up
to think about it.

1021
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,652
You know what I want, Gary.

1022
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:25,945
Say it.

1023
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,866
Make this the moment.

1024
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,369
Make Riley the breaking point.

1025
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:38,500
"US Embassy staff grabbed off the streets,
kidnapped, killed.

1026
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:43,171
The monsters have taken over Lebanon.
Something needs to be done."

1027
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,674
Give us the green light.
We could clear this place out in a month.

1028
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:50,178
Just burn Cal
and give Israel the keys to the city?

1029
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,471
We should worry for him?

1030
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:55,558
- He's been a thorn in our side for years.
- Cal's network? His assets?

1031
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,812
You think the agency's
just gonna throw all that away?

1032
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,855
If he's not back soon,
they won't have a choice.

1033
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:02,774
Oh, God.

1034
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,484
You've got lemons, Gary.

1035
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,236
Make some lemonade.

1036
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,335
You have any idea how many people
we have looking for you?

1037
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,712
Obviously, not enough.

1038
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,342
This kid, the messenger, says what?
"Follow me"?

1039
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:33,179
He gave me a note.
It had one word on it. "Karim."

1040
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,098
I didn't have a lot of time
to make a decision.

1041
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,560
- No one shows up?
- No, the kid bails on me.

1042
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,812
I fall down, walk back here.

1043
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,148
I didn't see anybody out there
looking for me.

1044
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,066
I'm not staying.

1045
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,360
Another one for me, please.

1046
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,158
Take off your belt.

1047
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:54,868
What?

1048
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,286
Under the table.

1049
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,414
I'm giving you a new belt.

1050
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,459
A transmitter?

1051
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,462
I can't lose you again.

1052
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,593
Now, do us both a favor.

1053
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:15,430
You're speaking at the university
tomorrow, so make that your nightcap.

1054
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,515
And get something to eat.

1055
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:28,026
Merci.

1056
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,498
We're five days
and counting, Gaines.

1057
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,710
How much longer can you wait
before you start pulling Cal's people?

1058
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,755
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1059
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,590
What if this is all bullshit,

1060
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,092
and they've been working Cal over
from the start?

1061
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,969
That's Mossad talking.

1062
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:57,597
Fuck that, it's common sense.

1063
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,390
But I hate to say it, Gaines,

1064
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:00,308
Cal talks...

1065
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,270
you want to be waiting for bodies
to pile up on the Embassy sidewalk?

1066
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,274
Tel Aviv loves this, don't they?

1067
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,779
We're gonna lose every asset we've got.
They'll be the only game left in town.

1068
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,322
It's a tough decision,

1069
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,617
but I need to know
you're thinking about it clearly.

1070
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,914
Just give me 12 more hours.

1071
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,084
Maybe we'll get lucky.

1072
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,922
What the hell are we gonna do with Skiles?

1073
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,050
Do with him? He's a drunk.

1074
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,095
He's got the belt now,
so keep an eye on him.

1075
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,641
He fucks anything up, well...

1076
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,560
it's always good to have someone to blame.

1077
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:51,818
Thank you. Yes, and next question. You.

1078
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,446
With the striped shirt and the glasses.
And do speak up. Don't be shy.

1079
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,531
Mr. Skiles,

1080
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,576
you worked on the Paris peace talks
when you were very young.

1081
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,160
Was that your first negotiation?

1082
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,871
Uh...

1083
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,707
My first? No.

1084
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,876
No, not by a long shot. Uh...

1085
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,922
I was raised as an only child
in a very small home with two people

1086
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:16,050
who basically hated each other
just enough to stay together.

1087
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:21,222
So, I guess you could say I've been
mediating since before I was born.

1088
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:26,311
So, to give you some kind of context,
when I was about nine years old,

1089
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,230
one night my father came home

1090
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,690
from one of his girlfriends' house.

1091
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,068
And my mother served him
for dinner that night

1092
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,613
about a dozen of his best racing pigeons.

1093
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,907
It would be about ten more years

1094
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,493
before I heard the term
"Mutually Assured Destruction,"

1095
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:46,748
but rest assured, I was very familiar
with it growing up in that...

1096
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,805
- Go, go! Go!
- Look for channel 5!

1097
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,724
No, channel 6.

1098
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,060
- Get me my beacon.
- Working on it.

1099
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,192
Let me help you, sir. Mr. Teppler.

1100
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,159
The pharmacy Jumblatt! Jumblatt!

1101
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,160
What?

1102
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,829
Jumblatt near the Druze cemetery!

1103
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,164
Pharmacy Jumblatt!

1104
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,791
You leave now. Alone.

1105
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,044
- You understand? You need to go now!
- Yes! Yes!

1106
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:35,963
I need Crowder on the line now.

1107
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:39,008
Crowder's in a van outside.
Pick it up. Line two.

1108
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,136
Sandy? What happened? Where's Skiles?

1109
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,638
I have no idea. Unknown.

1110
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,931
Where the hell's my beacon?

1111
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,016
I can't get a fix. We have to move.

1112
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,274
Hey, where is he?

1113
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,068
He's gone. He's gone.

1114
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:01,072
- He disappeared.
- We're going to leave.

1115
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:02,949
We're on the move.

1116
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,450
Do not lose him!

1117
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,037
Shit! Skiles is MIA.

1118
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,748
- Missing or taken?
- I don't know, but he's got the belt.

1119
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:14,377
- I want that signal relayed in here!
- Yes, sir. I'm on it.

1120
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,380
- Let's get a flag up for the Ops team.
- Got it.

1121
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,466
Ethan, get me a line
to the SEALs Ops team.

1122
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:45,074
It's not safe here, friend.

1123
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,286
Thank you.

1124
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,738
Stop where you are.

1125
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:08,658
Don't move.

1126
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:16,791
Put this on.

1127
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,678
Okay, 300 yards.
Straight ahead. Signal's good.

1128
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:32,306
Three hundred yards. Clear signal.
Signal's locking in.

1129
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,101
They're moving southwest 200 yards.

1130
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,314
Go left on Rue de I'ArmÃ©e!

1131
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,192
Heading off the left now.
Stabilizing.

1132
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,360
Stabilizing?

1133
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,153
Signal's still stabilizing.

1134
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:48,656
It's stationary.

1135
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,535
Search him!

1136
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:54,829
Let's go, search him.

1137
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:56,706
Get me an address.

1138
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,876
- Can we get an address right away?
- Gaines, come here.

1139
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,795
- We're sending them in?
- Mmm-hmm.

1140
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,840
Tell Crowder to get out of there now
before this gets loud.

1141
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,272
Come on, hurry!

1142
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,614
Don't fucking move!

1143
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:32,533
Hands where I can see 'em!
Keep your hands up!

1144
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,994
Don't fucking move! Not a move!

1145
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:41,792
Motherfucker!

1146
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,207
You have one minute.

1147
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:35,972
Hey, Cal.

1148
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:40,726
You're not hallucinating. It's Mason.

1149
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,604
Are you okay? You look okay.

1150
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,067
I'm here to help you,
but we don't have a lot of time.

1151
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,276
We gotta work quick.

1152
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,197
- Mason, how did you get here?
- Stop. Listen to me. All right?

1153
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,992
Now, Rafid Abu Rajal is missing.

1154
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,412
And we're trying to make a trade for you.

1155
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,707
- The brother?
- Yes.

1156
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,876
They asked me to come and make a deal.

1157
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,672
Now I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

1158
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,300
They sent me to Israel to try to find him.

1159
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,929
You know how wild it can get there,

1160
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,306
and you have to goose things
along sometimes

1161
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,767
and chase things you don't wanna chase.

1162
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,853
Israel? No, no, that's not who...

1163
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,730
Karim has been very patient.

1164
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,149
Karim's been very patient.

1165
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,485
But your friends...

1166
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,362
Your friends at the Embassy...

1167
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,407
They like this idea.

1168
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,370
Yeah.

1169
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,500
I don't have many friends as I used to.

1170
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,335
Okay, you can see everything's okay.

1171
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,588
I think we all need friends.

1172
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:56,135
Cal, I know I could use a friend.
I could use someone to trust.

1173
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,430
Right? Don't you think that's true?

1174
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,057
People can trust people

1175
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,768
based on whether or not
they have something to gain?

1176
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:07,188
Right? What do you think about that, Cal?

1177
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,775
What do you think about those gains?

1178
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,736
Do you think those gains can be trusted?

1179
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,654
No.

1180
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,574
No, I wouldn't trust those gains.

1181
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,703
I'd feel a lot safer in a crowd.

1182
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,080
In a crowd?

1183
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,082
- More of a crowd.
- That's enough.

1184
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,416
On a sandy beach.

1185
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,168
- That's enough.
- Sandy.

1186
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,086
It's enough.

1187
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,921
- Have you talked to Alice?
- Mm-hmm.

1188
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,757
Get her to show you
the picture in my apartment.

1189
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,592
- Time is over.
- You need Abu Rajal?

1190
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:37,635
That's all they want.

1191
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,345
Tell Alice I pray she loves me only.

1192
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,554
- What?
- Stop.

1193
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,473
Tell her I pray she loves me only!

1194
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,141
- I pray she loves me only!
- Stop!

1195
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,060
I pray she loves me only!

1196
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,604
- What was that?
- You told me I could talk to him.

1197
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,231
You have seven hours.

1198
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,109
- How do I contact...
- No. Talking is finished.

1199
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:56,695
You come to Fadya Crossing
at 2:30 a.m. with my brother.

1200
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,031
Karim, that's not possible.

1201
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:03,369
Okay. So I sell Riley to the Iranians.
Good luck with them.

1202
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,871
Fadya Crossing, 2:30.

1203
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,235
Stop!

1204
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:02,780
Put the bottle down.

1205
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:07,326
- Think the gun is really necessary?
- I wish I knew.

1206
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,078
Come up, come up. He's here.

1207
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,997
You might want to wait a second.

1208
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,832
What the fuck are you doing here?

1209
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,378
I'm here looking for something
that Cal told me was important.

1210
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:18,963
Turn around.

1211
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,550
- When was this?
- About an hour ago.

1212
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:25,552
Tell me something I can believe.

1213
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,307
- Cal told me I could trust you.
- Sorry.

1214
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,851
And that Gaines was not on our side.

1215
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:35,479
- Who are you working for?
- My friend.

1216
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,231
Yeah? Cal or Karim?

1217
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:40,234
He told me to look for a photo album,

1218
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,944
that there was something important in it.

1219
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,199
Where is he?

1220
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,201
- He's okay.
- Where?

1221
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,120
I don't know. We drove around.

1222
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,997
- I was blindfolded.
- You took off the belt.

1223
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,957
Yes. Are you kidding?

1224
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,545
You think I want Ruzak dialing in
a rocket strike on my last known location?

1225
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,839
There's nothing in that photo album.

1226
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,633
There's nothing here, Sandy.
What is going on?

1227
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:11,640
Don Gaines has been skimming money
from the station budget.

1228
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,059
There's a bank in Cyprus
and all this shit.

1229
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,937
Cal found out and wrote a grievance.

1230
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,522
That's what you've been looking for.

1231
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:20,357
Cal wrote it up, but he wanted to wait

1232
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:23,152
through the cease-fire
before he blew the whistle.

1233
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,448
And I took it out of the photo album.

1234
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:31,327
I didn't want Alice to find it
and light the fuse.

1235
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:35,664
Gaines is a thief and Cal knows about it.
You don't find that problematic?

1236
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:38,375
- Don doesn't know any of this.
- Would you bet Cal's life on that?

1237
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,211
Wouldn't matter. Cal's too valuable.

1238
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,464
No, Sandy. Now, Cal is expendable.

1239
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:46,842
He's a threat to Gaines
and a speed bump to Ruzak.

1240
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,302
They're just gonna burn him.

1241
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,803
Now they don't have to wait.

1242
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,055
What do you mean?

1243
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:54,224
Karim has given us six hours
to deliver the brother.

1244
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,812
You're wrong. We've got a deadline.

1245
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,191
They'll get the White House involved.
Israel has to budge.

1246
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,068
Israel never had Abu Rajal.

1247
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:08,781
They never said they did.
It cost them nothing to toy with Ruzak.

1248
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:10,449
Sandy?

1249
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,785
Yes, I'm here.

1250
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,913
Listen. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1251
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:21,585
Cal called it, okay? He kept saying,
"Pray. Love. Only.

1252
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:24,755
Pray. Love. Only."

1253
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,090
I think he's right.

1254
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,134
I think the PLO have Abu Rajal.

1255
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,677
What are we doing?

1256
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:35,724
Get the car.

1257
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:38,477
Come on, think about it.

1258
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,854
You're the PLO. You're Arafat.

1259
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:43,399
You're desperately trying
to hold this cease-fire together.

1260
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,276
The last thing you want
is the Israelis crossing the border.

1261
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,988
One more incident, one more bomb,
another assassination,

1262
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,698
and they'll stop asking for permission.

1263
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:54,076
They're gonna roll up
and push you right into the sea.

1264
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,662
Rafid Abu Rajal
and his little splinter group?

1265
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,373
That's a problem. He's uncontrollable.

1266
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:00,791
What do you do if you're Arafat?

1267
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:05,712
I think I would take him off the table.
I would put Abu Rajal on ice.

1268
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:08,424
Because Abu Rajal wants this to fuck up.

1269
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,551
He'd rather put a match
to this whole thing.

1270
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:14,430
Ruzak wants the same thing as Abu Rajal.

1271
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:18,767
He said it. We heard him.
"Two birds, one stone."

1272
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,770
He wants this to go sideways.

1273
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:22,813
He wants to tip it over

1274
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,274
and give Israel all the reason it needs
to come on in here.

1275
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:29,695
Come on. This is Cal talking.
This is him telling us what's going on.

1276
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,033
If you let Gaines and Ruzak
and the White House and Tel Aviv,

1277
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,203
if you let them run their game,
Cal's gone.

1278
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,667
Waiting only increases the risk.

1279
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:47,171
- You understand that, right?
- We blew our chance today.

1280
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,966
I need a master list
of Cal's assets and code keys.

1281
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,385
We'll start prioritizing
his people quickly,

1282
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,763
so we can get the relocation budgets
in place for the folks who qualify.

1283
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:59,725
- You're hearing me, right?
- It's a death sentence.

1284
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:03,437
Jesus, Sandy.
Nobody's quitting on Cal, okay?

1285
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,564
But we get paid to be ready.

1286
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,358
There's a hell of a lot
of unprotected pieces in the field.

1287
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,319
You think I don't know how you feel?

1288
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,988
That could be any of us out there.

1289
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,826
You're right.

1290
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,369
Maybe we'll get lucky.

1291
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,332
There's a secondary issue here
with Skiles.

1292
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,418
We need to wrap him up
as quickly as possible.

1293
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:29,838
It's covered.
We picked him up half an hour ago.

1294
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:33,550
- Where?
- The bar at the Napoli Hotel.

1295
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:36,428
They're gonna bring him over
as soon as he's sober.

1296
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,138
Son of a bitch.

1297
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:41,391
You know what, though?
Don't sober him up.

1298
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:43,894
Keep him bombed.

1299
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:48,941
Get his signature on a security release
and pour him onto a transpo tonight.

1300
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:52,152
Okay.

1301
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:53,487
Hey, Sandy?

1302
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,657
You've done a hell of a job.

1303
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:00,160
I hope you know that.
It hasn't gone unnoticed.

1304
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,415
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

1305
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:36,697
You change your mind?

1306
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,824
Little late for that.

1307
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:39,908
What do you mean?

1308
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:40,951
In an hour and a half,

1309
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,579
the Embassy duty officer
is gonna open the fifth floor safe

1310
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,498
and discover
four million dollars is missing.

1311
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,837
You're right. We're on our own.
That's Raffik.

1312
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,423
- Put them in back.
- He's coming with us.

1313
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:58,176
- Where is it we're going?
- I thought we'd try and make a deal.

1314
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,887
And do what? Shake down the PLO?

1315
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:04,683
Why not? I bet you're pretty handy
with four million bucks.

1316
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,423
Sandrine?

1317
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,467
Sandrine?

1318
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:39,551
My love!

1319
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,022
Listen closely, Bashir.

1320
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,817
You're going to tell me
what I want to know

1321
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,236
or this is the last breath you'll take.

1322
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,073
- What the fuck nonsense is this?
- Rafid Abu Rajal!

1323
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,658
Where is he?

1324
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,326
Where?

1325
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:08,372
You're not my only option, Bashir.

1326
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,878
Fuck you!

1327
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:16,213
Kill her.

1328
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:18,840
No.

1329
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,680
- The gun?
- Do what I tell you!

1330
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,016
- Too much noise...
- For chrissake.

1331
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,726
In the bedroom.
Go! Kill her.

1332
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,978
No. No.

1333
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:33,605
Sandrine!

1334
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,900
What craziness is this?

1335
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,736
You let a woman tell you what to do?

1336
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,751
Let's try one more time.

1337
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,548
Rafid Abu Rajal?

1338
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:00,632
Where is he?

1339
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,471
Now that you told us where he is,

1340
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,932
all you gotta do is go get him for us.

1341
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,185
Call it a finder's fee.

1342
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:15,856
$50,000 now, $50,000 on completion.

1343
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,150
That's a $100,000 phone call, Bashir.

1344
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:22,821
Plus another two million
if you can deliver Abu Rajal

1345
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:26,450
to Al-Mazar Square alive in the next hour.

1346
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,165
It's not so easy.

1347
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,709
I know it's not so easy. We all know that.

1348
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,711
That's why we're asking so nicely.

1349
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,172
And if the Old Man says no?

1350
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,967
If the Old Man says no,
then all this money goes home.

1351
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,974
Duty officer says
she signed the log.

1352
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:53,226
Thought it was for petty cash.

1353
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,312
All of it?
The whole four million?

1354
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:58,440
- She knows Riley's code.
- Oh, my God!

1355
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:01,777
She's got radio equipment,
vehicle, weapons.

1356
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:14,122
Get ready.

1357
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,508
Yes, I trust him.
He's one of Cal's people.

1358
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,260
Cal doesn't come back, he's cooked.

1359
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:29,221
He's fighting for his life.

1360
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:34,142
Is that what you're doing? For Cal?
Making a hell of an effort.

1361
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,481
It's not some huge romance,
if that's what you think.

1362
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:42,526
It's not.

1363
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:48,281
We're here, and it gets lonely.

1364
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,577
Better me than someone else.

1365
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,996
Hmm. Okay.

1366
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:58,291
Come on, Bashir. He has to be here now.

1367
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,502
He won't ditch us for 50 grand.

1368
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,046
If he tries to rip us off,
it'll be for the whole package.

1369
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:11,388
What's it like to throw
your whole career away in one night?

1370
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:15,809
- You should know, right?
- You're tougher than I was.

1371
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:22,107
I don't get surprised very often.
Not in a good way.

1372
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,277
That's my version of a compliment.

1373
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,904
All right. Thank you.

1374
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,198
Two cars approaching.

1375
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,033
Which direction?

1376
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:33,827
Southeast on Rue de Damas.

1377
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,495
They're coming southeast.

1378
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,247
Okay.

1379
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,457
She's telling him to get ready.

1380
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:43,003
- She's keyed off.
- Can you triangulate the exact location?

1381
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:45,630
She's smarter than that.
She's using just two walkies.

1382
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:47,299
I may be able to track the UHS signal.

1383
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,759
- Rue de Damas, where is it?
- Along here.

1384
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:53,597
There you go, $2 million.

1385
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,432
Two million is not enough.

1386
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:56,558
I'm in a hurry.

1387
01:29:56,641 --> 01:30:00,395
I'm already overpaying because
you know that, but I like my offer.

1388
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,813
The answer to two million is no.

1389
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:05,692
Mason, it's him. It's Abu Rajal.

1390
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:06,985
May we speak privately?

1391
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:14,743
We told Bashir two million,
and you brought us Abu Rajal.

1392
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:18,872
So let's get this settled quickly.
This is it. All I got.

1393
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:20,707
I'm topped out. Deal speaks for itself.

1394
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,752
You wouldn't open with your best offer
if your life depended on it.

1395
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,007
- Two point two-five.
- Five million.

1396
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,717
- Three.
- Four and a half is my floor.

1397
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,678
Point blank, I have $3.9 million exactly.

1398
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:34,804
Going once.

1399
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:36,890
Why should Bashir
be the only person to profit?

1400
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:40,226
- Going twice.
- If you take the three-nine right now,

1401
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:42,896
I swear I will tell Bashir
you settled for three-five.

1402
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:46,232
You can go back to Arafat
with your head held high

1403
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,526
and $400,000 in your pocket.

1404
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:54,532
Deal.

1405
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:57,160
All right, let's go.
We got him. Bring him.

1406
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:01,581
Get the rest of the money.

1407
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:02,958
This is the all the money.

1408
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,585
I had a feeling we could work this out.

1409
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,629
The thing that scares me about this

1410
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,507
is you haven't asked me
what I'm gonna do with him.

1411
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,759
At these prices...

1412
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:17,972
I want you to look at my hand.
You see that? It's a laser sight.

1413
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:21,685
It's attached to a very high-powered rifle
that my friend Raffik has up there.

1414
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:25,605
I've never seen anything like it.

1415
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,067
- I thought you came in good faith.
- I did.

1416
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,152
Now I want to leave in one piece.

1417
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:32,779
You don't move until after we leave,

1418
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,739
maybe you'll live to spend that money.

1419
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,159
Let's go.

1420
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:45,458
- Where the hell are they?
- Downstairs, sir.

1421
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:58,805
How much longer?

1422
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:01,683
Maybe he'll wait.

1423
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,230
We've waited too long.

1424
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:11,317
Let's get out of here!

1425
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:15,113
Listen, I want to go! Let's go.

1426
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:18,283
Go!

1427
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:19,868
Let's go.

1428
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,546
Heads up!
300 meters.

1429
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,299
It's the Christian militia.

1430
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,392
I'll talk our way through.

1431
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,519
With Abu Rajal in the car? Impossible!

1432
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,566
- Rami, no!
- I'm going through!

1433
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:58,281
We can make it!

1434
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,465
Fuck.

1435
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:23,264
You're crazy!

1436
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,821
They're not coming!

1437
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,075
Come on, they're not coming!

1438
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,127
Turn off the engine.

1439
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:55,213
Turn it off!

1440
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:25,952
Stay alert!

1441
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:29,122
Where are you going?
They're waiting for me.

1442
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:30,832
Anything might happen.

1443
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,458
I'm not staying here.

1444
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:35,670
Another second with this murdering fuck,
and I'll lose my mind.

1445
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,717
May this be your last
lucky day, you son of a whore!

1446
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:43,553
You're right. He's right.

1447
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,435
What the hell is this?

1448
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,186
You're not putting this through.

1449
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,105
You can bet your ass I am.

1450
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:57,442
- Frank, this is not your area.
- This is an intel operation.

1451
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,027
It's a goddamn rodeo.

1452
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,821
- Mason, do you read me?
- They keyed back in.

1453
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:03,281
Yes, I can hear you.

1454
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:07,410
It's him. It's Karim.

1455
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:09,996
- The goddamn location. Come on.
- Almost there.

1456
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:13,416
I'll keep the walkie keyed,
so you can hear what's going on.

1457
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,251
Copy.

1458
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:31,267
Cal goes first. He makes it across safe,
then you get your brother.

1459
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:32,268
Why should I do that?

1460
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,647
Because you'll have me. I'll stay.

1461
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,357
You're not worth so much.

1462
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:39,776
Maybe you should've had
someone more important

1463
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,152
make your deal for you.

1464
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:47,325
All right. All right.

1465
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:50,078
We're moving forward.
Cal's gonna come over.

1466
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,580
- Till then, stay put.
- I'm getting a lock on this.

1467
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:53,998
Figure out the location...

1468
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:55,917
Just give me 30 seconds.

1469
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,919
Get a team rolling now.

1470
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:00,713
- Looks like...
- Get a fucking team rolling!

1471
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:03,633
No, God damn it! This is Mason's deal.

1472
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,678
It's his hand,
and you're gonna let him play it.

1473
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,262
You step in now,

1474
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:11,391
and I'll make sure you own this
all the way to a Senate hearing.

1475
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:26,656
I think about Nadia.

1476
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,079
Always good people suffer the most, huh?

1477
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,750
Were we that wrong about you?

1478
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:40,336
What? Was I a terrorist?

1479
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:43,798
Not then.

1480
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,300
Not that night.

1481
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:50,013
But in the morning.

1482
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,811
Cut him loose.

1483
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:08,823
How you doing, buddy. You okay?
Here's the deal.

1484
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:13,077
You're gonna go over alone.
I'll stay here until it's done.

1485
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,330
That's your plan?

1486
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,458
It's kind of a work in progress.

1487
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:22,170
Shit.

1488
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:24,756
All right, go.
I'll see you on the other side.

1489
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:27,675
Go!

1490
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,014
He's coming over.
Get the brother ready.

1491
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,432
Copy that.

1492
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:40,521
Cal?

1493
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:43,232
Yeah. It's me.

1494
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:53,367
Cal.

1495
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,721
Rafid!

1496
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:20,853
I knew you'd be safe.

1497
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:22,313
Karim, are we good?

1498
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:23,815
Let him go.

1499
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,656
And I thank you, brother.

1500
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:35,618
- Rafid, no!
- Whoa!

1501
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,287
- Curse me, do you?
- What's he doing?

1502
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,498
- You're free, Rafid.
- Curse me now!

1503
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,416
We're done here.
It's all good.

1504
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:44,544
Rafid, put the gun...

1505
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:45,503
Go, Mason. Go!

1506
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,304
Rafid!

1507
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:58,015
Rafid!

1508
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,229
Move! Move!

1509
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,409
Mason!

1510
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:20,121
Mason, come on!

1511
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:25,209
Grab my hand! Grab it!

1512
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:29,964
All right, I got you.

1513
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:48,024
Bernard! Great!

1514
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:49,400
Get in! Get in!

1515
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:51,777
Sandrine!

1516
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:53,196
Get in! Good girl!

1517
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:59,577
Okay, let's go!

1518
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:17,762
Almost done here.

1519
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:23,643
All right, you're all set.

1520
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:45,081
I'll let you talk to Mason.

1521
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:46,832
Okay.

1522
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:57,009
You good?

1523
01:40:58,427 --> 01:41:00,763
I'll let you know
once these meds wear off.

1524
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:02,139
How about you?

1525
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:06,143
I'll let you know after I get a shower.

1526
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:08,563
Think they'll ever find Karim?

1527
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:11,774
Well, if he doesn't find us first.

1528
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,988
I still cannot believe
you pulled this through, man.

1529
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:20,241
I mean, I feel like I won the lottery.

1530
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,245
You saved my life
and I got to see you again.

1531
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,709
Let's not take so long to do it next time.
Okay?

1532
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:32,128
I would like that.

1533
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:36,007
Thank you, Cal.

1534
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:40,970
That's the meds talking.

1535
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:46,934
Are you up for a quick debrief
at the Embassy?

1536
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:50,438
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

1537
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,648
Yeah, well, it's more of a luncheon.

1538
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:54,358
Ruzak gonna be there?

1539
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:58,529
He's in the air back to DC.
He's got some powerful friends.

1540
01:41:58,612 --> 01:42:00,323
Who's in charge of the station?

1541
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:03,909
Well, that job just opened up.
Don Gaines resigned this morning.

1542
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:05,494
Not exactly sure why.

1543
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:08,539
But we did come in on budget.

1544
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,249
All I'm saying, Mason,

1545
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:13,961
is that there is a general satisfaction
all around with the results here.

1546
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:16,547
- Is that what you're saying?
- Things happened in haste.

1547
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:18,924
People acted in ways

1548
01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:23,387
that might be subject
to a variety of legitimate interpretation.

1549
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:25,056
Enough dancing, Frank.

1550
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:29,769
Everybody got what they wanted.
It's a rare thing.

1551
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:31,479
Might as well enjoy it.

1552
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:35,983
- So, you riding with me?
- I got him.

1553
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,868
Just forget all this ever happened, huh?
You really gonna go for that?

1554
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:47,953
You should try it.

1555
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:51,290
If I were you, I'd kiss this place goodbye
once and for all.

1556
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:53,042
What if you were you?

1557
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:56,587
I've got
a pretty good bargaining position.

1558
01:42:57,797 --> 01:43:00,508
They already offered up
some pleasant options.

1559
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:03,052
You got somebody making that deal for you?

1560
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:07,264
I've got a short list.

1561
01:43:08,641 --> 01:43:11,394
I'm around till dinner
if you really want to stick it to 'em.

1562
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:51,642
The Israeli Army has moved
into southern Lebanon.

1563
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,895
It has a clear-cut single mission.

1564
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:57,148
Namely, pushing the PLO forces

1565
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,733
out of artillery range
of Israeli settlements.

1566
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:01,736
After months of rocket attacks,

1567
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,487
Israeli soldiers backed up by tanks

1568
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:06,449
move up the coastal road into West Beirut.

1569
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:09,827
The Israeli invasion
of Lebanon has been deep and wide.

1570
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:12,413
It encompasses an area
smaller than Delaware

1571
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:13,998
and a third larger than Rhode Island.

1572
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:17,334
Evacuation of
over 800 PLO fighters began today,

1573
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:20,171
as more American troops arrived in Beirut
to keep the peace.

1574
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:23,382
Pentagon officials say
this terrorist attack

1575
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:25,843
caused the four-story structure
to collapse,

1576
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:28,095
trapping and killing those Marines.

1577
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:31,557
In Beirut today,
a pickup truck loaded with explosives

1578
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,184
drove to the American Embassy

1579
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,520
and there was a tremendous explosion
during lunch hour.

1580
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:37,605
Peter Jennings begins...

1581
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:40,232
This criminal attack
on a diplomatic establishment

1582
01:44:40,316 --> 01:44:45,196
will not deter us from our goals of peace
in the region.
