1
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:11,605
Bare-ass naked with his socks still on?

2
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,315
-Yeah, they do it like that up North.
-What for? Protective purposes?

3
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,520
-Ask me?
-Ask Jack.

4
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,910
It's his old stamping ground.

5
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,120
Must be a bloody contortionist.

6
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,725
Not suede boots!

7
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,225
Knock it off, Gerald.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,800
What? And get the clap?

9
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,000
We don't want you
to go up to the North, Jack.

10
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,600
No?

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,500
You work for us, Jack.

12
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,400
You know we're connected
with the Newcastle mob.

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,900
I'd hate you to screw it up.

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,500
What's that, a python?

15
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,700
What are you going for?

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,800
To find out what happened.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Look, your brother's dead and gone.

18
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,500
They're hard nuts up there, Jack.

19
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,200
They won't take kindly to someone
from London poking his nose in.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,500
-Too bad.
-Remember, they're killers. Just like you.

21
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,000
The police seem satisfied.

22
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,700
Since when was that good enough?

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
Think again, Jack.

24
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,500
I will.

25
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,500
Pint of bitter.

26
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,900
In a thin glass.

27
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Mr. Carter?

28
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,800
Is there a Mr. Carter in the room?

29
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,100
Yeah.

30
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,900
Hello?

31
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,900
Margaret?

32
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,500
Why the hell aren't you here?

33
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,100
What time?

34
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,900
Is Doreen at the house?

35
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Who's with him, then?

36
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,700
When can I see you?
Will you be there tomorrow?

37
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,500
Now listen...

38
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
-I won't be using the room tonight.
-I see.

39
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm staying with a friend.

40
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,000
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?

41
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,100
-It's not like that, love.
-It never is.

42
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,700
-Are you a traveler?
-Definitely.

43
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,800
-Will this do?
-Yes.

44
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Very nice. I'll pay you for tonight as well.

45
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,300
Don't be bloody silly.
You're the first since Monday.

46
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,100
-You sure?
-Sure.

47
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,700
I'll bet this has seen some action, hasn't it?

48
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,800
I'll give you the key when you come down.

49
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,100
Was he in bad shape?

50
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,300
They come worse.

51
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,300
Doreen. All right, are you?

52
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,500
Been staying with a friend?

53
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm sorry about your father.

54
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Tell me, Doreen...

55
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,700
...did the police say anything?

56
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,700
They said he was drunk.

57
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,400
How's school?

58
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,400
I left last year.

59
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,700
-What are you doing now?
-Working at Woolworth's.

60
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,900
-That must be very interesting.
-Yes.

61
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,400
What are you going to do?
Live with Margaret?

62
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,900
Well, why won't you come with us
to South America?

63
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,500
My fiancée won't mind, and that's
how your Dad would have liked it.

64
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,300
Get Hubert up, will you?

65
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,500
We're ready now, sir.

66
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,300
We weren't sure where it was taking place,
you know.

67
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
-Nice of you to come.
-No, Frank was a good bloke.

68
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,400
-He was that.
-One of the best.

69
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
-I couldn't believe it when I heard.
-What?

70
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,900
I was surprised
when he didn't turn up for work.

71
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
He was always on time.

72
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,200
-Did you work with him, Keith?
-At the Half Moon.

73
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,300
It's a bloody funny thing, you know.

74
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,800
You work with a bloke
for six bloody years...

75
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,800
...and all the time
he's as calm as gentle Jesus.

76
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,500
Then he goes and does a thing like that.
A bloody funny thing.

77
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,900
Yeah, a bloody funny thing.

78
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
<i>Will you all stand up, please.</i>

79
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,600
"For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God...

80
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
"...of his great mercy
to take unto Himself...

81
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,300
"...the soul of our dear brother

82
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,100
"...we therefore commit his body
to be consumed by fire...

83
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,700
"...in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life...

84
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,300

85
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,700
"...who shall change the body
of our low estate..."

86
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,300
-Is that Margaret?
-Yes.

87
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,000
"Who shall change the body
of our low estate...

88

90
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,800
"...all things to Himself."

91
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,100
Margaret.

92
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,400
I thought you weren't coming.

93
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,300
Changed me mind.
Everything go off all right, then?

94
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,400
Fine. I want to talk to you.

95
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,600
-What about?
-Doreen.

96
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,800
She's nothing to do with me.

97
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,700
What do you mean?

98
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,800
You've been Frank's bird
ever since her mother cleared off.

99
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,600
You're closer to her than anyone.

100
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
No, it's not like that.

101
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,500
I've got a husband, you know.

102
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,300
Hold it. Hold it.

103
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,500
Who killed Frank, Margaret?

104
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,300
Killed?

105
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,400
I don't know anything about it.

106
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,800
Really?

107
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,900
I must go. I'm in a hurry.

108
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,400
I want to talk to you later.

109
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,900
-I can't.
-Tomorrow morning, then?

110
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, all right then.
12:00 on the Iron Bridge.

111
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,300
Well, absent friends.

112
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,500
You don't suppose
he might have done it on purpose?

113
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,500
What? You mean, kill himself?

114
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,700
No. Frank, kill himself? Get away.

115
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,700
I mean, what for?

116
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,400
-That's what I was wondering.
-Come off it.

117
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,900
Frank was, well, straight.

118
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,300
He had no worries I know of.
It would have showed.

119
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,200
Why would it?

120
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,100
It just would, that's all.
Frank was always the same.

121
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,100
Since when did Frank drink whisky?

122
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,000
-I don't know.
-No. Nobody seems to know.

123
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,700
He was a bloody good bloke.
One of the best.

124
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,300
How would you know? Or you? Or you?

125
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,000
None of you knew. I knew.
He was me dad.

126
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,600
Okay. Let her go.

127
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,000
-I'm sorry about that.
-Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.

128
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,300
-Let's have another drink.
-No, I must be off. I should be at work.

129
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,900
-Get your suit cleaned.
-That's all right.

130
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
Come on. Thanks for coming, Eddie.

131
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,200
Frank was a good bloke.
It's the least I could have done.

132
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,100
-Do you work here, Keith?
-Yeah.

133
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,000
If anyone comes in and asks for me...

134
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,500
-...you let me know, right?
-Yeah, all right.

135
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,700
I'm at the Las Vegas behind the dance hall.

136
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,800
Do you know a man called Albert Swift?

137
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Yeah, he comes in here a bit.

138
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,900
Where would I find him?

139
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,200
Today? At the races. He always goes.

140
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
How come you know Albert?

141
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I went to school with him.
He'll know what's going on in this town.

142
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,000
Grey suits you, Eric.

143
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
-Good God.
-Is He?

144
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,900
-Jack. Jack Carter.
-Eric. Eric Paice.

145
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,700
What are you doing around here?

146
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,900
-Didn't you know this is my hometown?
-No, I didn't know that.

147
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,900
Funny, that.

148
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,200
Thanks.

149
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,300
So what're you doing then?
On your holidays?

150
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,200
-No, I'm visiting relatives.
-That's nice.

151
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,700
It would be if they were still living.

152
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,800
Meaning what?

153
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,900
-Bereavement, death in the family.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

154
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
That's all right, Eric.

155
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,300
-Small world, isn't it?
-Very.

156
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:48,100
-So who you working for these days, Eric?
-I'm straight. Respectable.

157
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,100
What're you doing? Advertising Martini?

158
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,100
-You've been watching television.
-Yeah.

159
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,600
Come off it, Eric.

160
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,300
Who is it?

161
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,900
Brumby?

162
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Kinnear?

163
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
What's it to you, anyway?

164
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,500
I've always had your welfare at heart, Eric.

165
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,400
Besides which, I'm nosy.

166
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,900
That's not always
a healthy way to be, is it?

167
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,000
And you should know.

168
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,300
-If I remember rightly.
-Oh, yes.

169
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,100
So, you're doing all right then, Eric.

170
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,000
-You're making good.
-Making all right.

171
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,900
Good prospects for advancement, is there?
A pension?

172
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,300
Do you know?

173
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,700
I'd almost forgotten
what your eyes look like.

174
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,400
They're still the same.

175
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,700
Piss-holes in the snow.

176
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,500
-Still got a sense of humor.
-Yeah.

177
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes, I retained that, Eric.

178
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,100
Do you know a man called Albert Swift?

179
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,900
Can't say I do.

180
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,700
Don't miss the start on my account.

181
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,500
-Carter's here.
-Where?

182
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,500
-I don't know.
-You stupid shit.

183
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,900
You see what it's like these days, Jack?

184
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,200
-You can't get the material.
-Yes, I can see your problem, Mr. Kinnear.

185
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,800
-Sit down, Jack.
-Thank you.

186
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,600
I could weep, I really could.

187
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,300
Sometimes I think I'll retire...

188
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,300
...just piss off to the Bahamas
and let somebody else employ them.

189
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,600
Glenda, get Jack a drink.

190
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,400
-What is it, Jack?
-Scotch, please.

191
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,300
Piss off, Ray.

192
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,700
Eric told me of your bereavement.

193
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

194
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,000
Do you know I never knew he worked
in one of my places?

195
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,100
It's funny that. Neither did I.

196
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,900
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up
with something better.

197
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,500
Yeah.

198
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
Nasty way to go.

199
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,100
Yes.

200
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,700
Are we here to play cards
or talk about the old days?

201
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,400
Harry.

202
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,200
Jack, I don't want to be rude,
but these men have brought...

203
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,200
...a lot of money with them.

204
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,800
Glenda, you don't offer
a man like Jack a drink...

205
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,800
...in these piddling little glasses.
Give him the bloody bottle.

206
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,800
Now where are we?

207
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,300
-I think I'll stay as I am.
-You're bluffing, you bastard.

208
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,800
That's what you pay to find out.
Right, Jack?

209
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,300
Right. If you can afford it.

210
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,800
Thought you were going soon.

211
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,300
Soon. When you've lost your money.
Won't take long.

212
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,700
-Clever sod, aren't you?
-Only comparatively.

213
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,100
Harry, I don't like to push but...

214
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,600
...could you let us know
how much your hand's worth?

215
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,500
I'm taking two.

216
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,100
Do you know Sid Fletcher?

217
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,500
What?

218
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,400
Do you know Sid Fletcher?

219
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,800
I work for him.

220
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,300
Do you?

221
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,700
Yes, I do.

222
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,200
£100.

223
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,800
What's that? £100?

224
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,000
That's right, Harry.

225
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,600
Your £100 and another £100.

226
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,200
-I know him, too.
-Another £100.

227
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,300
-Who?
-Sid Fletcher.

228
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,700
-£25 notes of the realm.
-Do you?

229
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,500
-Do you really know Sid Fletcher?
-£200, and another.

230
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,700
I know Sid Fletcher.

231
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,700
What's that?

232
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,800
£200.

233
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,000
I'll follow that.

234
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
£200.

235
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Yes, I met him last year.

236
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,100
-All right, and another £200.
-Oh, yes. When he came up on business.

237
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,900
-Really?
-I don't know, what shall I do?

238
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,300
He came to see Mr. Kinnear.

239
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,100
-Is that £200?
-Did he?

240
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,700
That's right, Harry.
You can always see me if you want to.

241
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Didn't he, Mr. Kinnear?

242
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,500
All right, your £200 and another £200.

243
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,900
What's that?

244
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,600
£600, Harry.

245
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,800
£200 to follow you, and I've raised it £400.

246
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,200
-£400?
-That's right, Harry.

247
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,600
You're not seeing me?

248
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,100
No.

249
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,000
All right, I'll see you.

250
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
-Calling my bluff, are you Harry?
-Yeah.

251
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,900
We went about together.

252
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,800
Really?

253
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,300
While he was here.

254
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
While he was here,
you went about together.

255
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,400
He was here for four days.

256
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,900
-Was he?
-About.

257
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,400
Would you do me a favor?

258
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, I'll do you a favor.

259
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,100
Would you please put my glass
on the table?

260
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,200
Come on, Harry. I haven't won, have I?

261
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,600
Go on you're pulling my leg.

262
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,300
What about that, Jack?

263
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,000
-Old Harry thought I was having him on.
-Shut up.

264
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,900
Not going, Jack?

265
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,700
I have to. Things to do.

266
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,700
Of course.

267
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,900
Any time, just drop by.

268
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah, I'll do that.

269
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?

270
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,200
Jack, I didn't like that.

271
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,500
-You should've told me who you work for.
-Cyril didn't like it, either.

272
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,200
-So it's all girls together, is it?
-He thinks Sid and Gerald won't like it...

273
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,900
...when they hear
you've been sticking your nose in.

274
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,400
He's right. Tell him to save the money
on the phone call.

275
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,300
What do you want?

276
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,700
What happened to this car?

277
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,700
What's it got to do with you?

278
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,700
-This is my brother's car.
-All right.

279
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,900
Well, he drove it into the river.

280
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,800
-Was the steering faulty?
-No.

281
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,900
-What about the brakes?
-Fine. Nothing wrong with them.

282
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,900
How did it happen then?

283
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,000
He was drunk, drunk as a lord.

284
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,200
-What you having, Jack?
-Large scotch.

285
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,100
Heard of a man called Thorpe?

286
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Old Thorpey?

287
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,000
-Haven't seen him in a long time.
-That's what he was saying about you.

288
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,800
He said he'd heard you were up in town,
wondered if I knew you were staying.

289
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,100
He wants to look you up, old time's sake.

290
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,500
That's nice. What did you tell him?

291
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,000
-Nought.
-Good lad.

292
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,000
See you later.

293
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,000
-Where you off?
-Las Vegas. Come over.

294
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,500
-You all right now?
-Yeah.

295
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,300
-Are you coming to South America?
-No.

296
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,300
Where you going to live then?

297
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,700
At me friend's house.

298
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,500
-Well, where's that?
-Wilton Estate.

299
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,200
They're a nice family, are they?
Churchgoers and all that?

300
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,800
Good.

301
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm off tomorrow,
so I don't suppose I'll be seeing you again.

302
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Here.

303
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,400
-Go and get your hair done.
-Thanks.

304
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,100
Be good.

305
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,300
And don't trust boys.

306
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,900
That was left for you this evening.
What is it?

307
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,100
-My brother Frank.
-Is he staying the night?

308
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,700
Funny.

309
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,000
Can I phone London?

310
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,900
It'll cost you.

311
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,100
Hello?

312
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,100
I miss you.

313
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,900
I fancy you.

314
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,100
I wish I was touching you...

315
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
...right now.

316
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,300
Making love to you.

317
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,100
I want...

318
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,500
...to stroke you...

319
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,900
...and kiss you all over.

320
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,400
Where are you?

321
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,400
In the bedroom.

322
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,900
My black underwear.

323
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,100
The sexy silk ones?

324
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,300
Take your bra off.

325
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Stop it, darling.

326
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,200
No.

327
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,800
Go on.

328
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,000
Now...

329
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,700
...hold them gently...

330
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,700
<i>...slowly...</i>

331
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,000
<i>...imagine it's me.</i>

332
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,900
When we're in South America...

333
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,100
<i>...we'll make love in the sun.</i>

334
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,600
Roll over.

335
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,400
<i>Make love again.</i>

336
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,500
<i>And again.</i>

337
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,400
With me.

338
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,400
<i>I really fancy you.</i>

339
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,500
What's the matter,
you got gut trouble or something?

340
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,500
No, darling. Just doing my exercises.

341
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,200
Listen, Janet, Gerald's just walked in.
I must ring off.

342
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, I'll come tomorrow.

343
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,100
Save it till Sunday.

344
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,100
I'll be back then.

345
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,300
That'll be for me.

346
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Thorpe! They were waiting for us
in the car park.

347
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,800
-How many?
-Four of them.

348
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,700
-Jack?
-Good evening.

349
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,800
I'd like a word with you, Jack.

350
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,500
-That's nice.
-The confidential like.

351
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,500
You stay in the car, I'll come and listen.

352
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,700
What do you want to tell me?

353
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,400
I've been asked to give you this.

354
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,000
Train goes four minutes past 12:00.
You've just got time.

355
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,700
That's very kind of somebody.
Who do I have to thank?

356
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,100
What happens if I miss the train?

357
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,500
-I've been asked to make sure you don't.
-Oh, really?

358
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
You're getting very optimistic
in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?

359
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Let's stop pissing about.

360
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,600
Are you coming, Jack? It'd be best.

361
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,000
Righto, lads.

362
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Don't worry about him!

363
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,700
Thorpey!

364
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,000
Hello, Keith. Stay there, Thorpey.

365
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,000
What the bloody hell
do you think you're at?

366
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,700
-I'm sorry.
-You don't look it.

367
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,500
-No. Really, I am.
-Don't pull that bloody flannel with me.

368
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,400
If you're a traveler, I'm bloody Twiggy.
And who's he?

369
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Are you still at it?
Have you no thought for others?

370
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,700
-We're going inside.
-Why should I give the room to your sort?

371
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,400
-Upstairs, the door on the right.
-Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.

372
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,700
They knew there'd be trouble
when you moved in.

373
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,900
-You keep your trap shut, Ma.
-I'll send the old man to see you.

374
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,900
And wouldn't he love it.
Where do you think you're going?

375
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,100
Why don't you make us all
a nice cup of tea?

376
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,800
What are you going to do?

377
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Make us a cup of tea and I'll tell you.
I might even let you watch.

378
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,300
-I'll call the police.
-No, you won't.

379
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,900
Well, now, Thorpey.

380
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,700
It seems...

381
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,900
...that I've got a secret benefactor.

382
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,900
That's nice, isn't it?

383
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,300
There's only one trouble.

384
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I don't know who to thank.

385
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,000
Now...

386
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,000
...I want to know who it is, Thorpey.

387
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,300
All right. If you like, Thorpey,
we'll stop mucking about.

388
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,800
Somebody doesn't want me
poking my nose into something...

389
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,800
...and I happen to know
what that something is.

390
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,700
Now stand up.

391
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,600
Who paid you to see me off?

392
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,300
Well, I can't, Jack! How can I?

393
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,900
-Yes, you can.
-Don't, Jack, don't!

394
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,100
Who sent you?

395
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,700
Brumby.

396
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,700
There we are, you see?
Now you could tell me, couldn't you?

397
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
Quickly.

398
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,900
Edna, come in. Join the tea set.

399
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,300
-Who's Brumby?
-Cliff Brumby?

400
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,700
Ever been to Westsea?

401
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,400
Ever been in an arcade there
and put a penny in a slot machine?

402
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,600
Well, 10-to-1, it belongs to Cliff Brumby.

403
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,300
Like as not the bloody arcade as well.
Right along the coast.

404
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,400
Isn't that right, Thorpey?

405
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,600
-Where's he living these days?
-He's got a new place at Burnham.

406
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,300
-Address?
-On Durham Road. The pantiles.

407
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,900
Suppose you tell me
what the hell is going on!

408
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,100
It's my house.

409
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,100
Yes, Edna, I must say,
I think you've been great about...

410
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,800
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.

411
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,700
Can I go?

412
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,800
You must be joking.
Keep him away from the telephone.

413
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,700
-I'm going out.
-Now, just a minute!

414
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,800
Don't let on I told you, for God's sake.

415
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,800
Jesus wept!

416
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,600
Now, Cliff, don't get mad.

417
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,200
I'll murder the little bitch!

418
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,600
-Daddy!
-That's right, bloody Daddy.

419
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,600
I wasn't expecting you until 3:00.

420
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,400
This is what you call having a few friends
over for coffee?

421
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,500
Running riot over my bloody furniture!

422
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,800
Spewing all over my bloody goldfish!

423
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,100
Good evening.

424
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,100
Sandra! Where do you want...

425
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,200
The front door is open.

426
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Who are you?

427
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,700
I'm an old friend of Cliff's.
I want to see him. It's urgent.

428
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,100
-What's it about?
-Business.

429
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,000
I know all about Cliff's business.

430
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,200
Yeah, well, tell him the Fletcher's sent me.

431
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,600
Cliff, Cliff!

432
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,500
What the hell is this?
Do you know the time?

433
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,900
-It's 2:00 in the morning!
-I know.

434
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,500
The Fletcher's sent you.

435
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,200
What is so important
it can't wait till the morning?

436
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,700
I'm not in the mood
for playing silly buggers.

437
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,300
I made a mistake.

438
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,200
-What?
-I made a mistake!

439
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,600
-What about?
-Never mind.

440
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,600
-It's not business?
-See you.

441
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,400
I don't like it when some nut comes
pushing in and out of my house at night.

442
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,300
Bloody well tell me who sent you!

443
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,000
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape.
With me it's a full-time job.

444
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,200
Now behave yourself.

445
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,300
Goodnight, Mrs. Brumby.

446
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,100
You sod!

447
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,900
They came back?

448
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,400
No.

449
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,000
Look at this, you bastard.

450
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,900
You don't care a stuff, do you?

451
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,300
I'll buy you another one.

452
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,700
What about the lad? They took him away.

453
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,300
What'll they do to him?

454
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,100
Don't ask me.

455
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,200
They bloody hurt me.

456
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,800
You're lucky. They kill as well.

457
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,300
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?

458
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,100
Thorpey nearly died laughing.

459
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,100
That little shit!

460
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,100
What about Keith?

461
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,900
-What about him?
-What you going to do?

462
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,200
-Pension him off.
-You're a bastard.

463
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,200
What am I supposed to do?

464
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,400
I don't know where they've taken him.
Do you?

465
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,000
So shut up!

466
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,600
What's that gun doing in your room?

467
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,100
Suppose I phone the police,
told them there's a bloke in my hotel...

468
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,800
...who's planning to shoot somebody?

469
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,800
You wouldn't do that.

470
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,100
How do you know I wouldn't?

471
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,300
'Cause I know you wear purple underwear.

472
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,300
What's that supposed to mean?

473
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,200
Think about it.

474
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,300
Are you awake?

475
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,200
No.

476
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,100
Do you want breakfast?

477
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:26,800
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast.

478
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,100
Did you sleep well?

479
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,900
Did you sleep well?

480
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,700
Yeah.

481
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,200
Yes, thank you.

482
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,500
Are you tired?

483
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,500
No.

484
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,700
Are you tired?

485
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,400
No, I'm not tired.

486
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,600
Do you eat breakfast?

487
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,200
Put us in it, Jack.

488
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,200
Don't let us interrupt you.

489
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,000
I might have guessed.

490
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,800
Sorry about this, Jack. Orders are orders.

491
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,700
What orders would they be?

492
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,700
Gerald phoned us up
in the middle of the night.

493
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,300
He'd heard you'd been making a nuisance
of yourself.

494
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,900
We've got to take you back to London.

495
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,300
He said it'd be doing him a big favor.

496
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,700
We know you're all steamed up,
so do Gerald and Sid.

497
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:19,100
But they have to be diplomatic.

498
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,600
Take me back to London.

499
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,000
Jack, don't you think
you ought to get dressed first?

500
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,600
Come on, Jack, put it away.
You know you won't use it.

501
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,700
The gun, he means.

502
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,500
Out! Out!

503
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,000
Out!

504
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,900
If Anna could see you now.

505
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,400
Now, Jack, be reasonable.

506
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,400
You know we're going to take you back
sooner or later.

507
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,100
Out!

508
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,500
Mind you don't catch cold, Jack.

509
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,800
I hope she's got understanding neighbors.

510
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,200
We'll see you when you've got
your drawers on.

511
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,900
Do me a favor, will you?

512
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,700
What, and get myself beaten up again?

513
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,900
-No chance of that.
-Not much.

514
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,700
-They're friends of mine.
-And that'll make me feel better?

515
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,000
Now I don't want to get rough, do I?
Take that.

516
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Out the back door.

517
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,900
Hold it!

518
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,600
Where do you think you're going?

519
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,700
Strawberry fair.

520
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,400
In.

521
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,800
Turn right.

522
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,700
Open that door and go inside.

523
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,600
-What are you going to do?
-Sit in the car and whistle "Rule Britannia".

524
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,100
-You're coming back?
-How could I stay away?

525
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,600
Where were you?

526
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,300
Bollocks!

527
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,700
Keith in?

528
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,400
Keith!

529
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,400
What happened to you then?

530
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,800
How did you find me?

531
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,900
They give you a rough time?

532
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:43,000
No, you bastard!
You knew they'd come back.

533
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,900
No, I didn't.

534
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,500
Does Albert Swift still live
across the ferry?

535
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,600
Get knotted.

536
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
All right.

537
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,700
I want to square things with you.

538
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,600
Oh, yeah? How? Stuff it!

539
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,200
My girlfriend's coming
from Liverpool tonight.

540
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,100
Nice surprise, isn't it?

541
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,600
I'm sorry.

542
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,100
Here, get yourself a course in karate.

543
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,500
Frank said you were a shit
and he was bloody well right!

544
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,100
You even screwed his wife, didn't you?

545
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,800
The poor bastard didn't even know
if the kid was his!

546
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,300
How were things...

547
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,400
...between you and Frank?

548
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,700
He was all right to me.

549
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,600
Nothing more? Just another fella?

550
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,000
Nicer than most.

551
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,700
-Just another fella though, wasn't he?
-Yes.

552
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,400
-Even though he was nicer than most?
-Yes.

553
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,600
I can't help the way I am.

554
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,600
Why'd you see him so regular?

555
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,200
Once a week?

556
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,200
I call that regular.

557
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,100
He was gentlemanly. I like that.

558
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,300
Once a week.
You like a gentleman, do you?

559
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:16,400
Look, I'm me. Right?
We are what we are, like it or not.

560
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,100
Why all the bloody needle?

561
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,400
What was bugging Frank?

562
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,800
He wanted me to leave Dave
and marry him.

563
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,500
Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work.
Dave would have killed us both.

564
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,600
He followed me home
and kicked up a stink in the street.

565
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,900
I had to tell Frank
I couldn't see him anymore.

566
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,700
It was getting too dodgy.

567
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,900
That was Sunday. He said he'd kill himself.

568
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,700
I was frightened what you might do.

569
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,300
I don't believe you. Frank wasn't like that.

570
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,600
I'm the villain in the family, remember?

571
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,500
It's the truth.

572
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,600
It is, honestly.

573
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,200
You bloody whore.

574
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,300
Frank was too careful to die like that.

575
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,000
Now who killed him?

576
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,200
I don't know nothing.

577
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,400
The only reason I came back
to this crap house...

578
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,600
...was to find out who did it.

579
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm not leaving till I do.

580
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,500
Do you understand?

581
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,800
Hello, Jack.

582
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,800
You bitch!

583
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,700
It was you who told them
I was here, wasn't it?

584
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:47,000
Peter's very upset about his car.
He's going to shit all over you.

585
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,700
I'll catch up with you, Margaret.

586
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,700
-You bastard!
-Come on, get me!

587
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,600
Over here, Jack.

588
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,600
Peter! Peter!

589
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,300
What the hell's she doing?

590
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,400
You didn't know you had
a fairy godmother, did you?

591
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,500
No, frankly, I didn't know that.

592
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:04,400
A fairy godmother all of your own.
Aren't you lucky?

593
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,900
Yeah. So, where are we going, Princess?

594
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,000
To the Demon King's Castle, of course.

595
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,300
Of course. Where else.

596
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,200
How did you know where I'd be?

597
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,400
You were seen parking your car.

598
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:38,300
The Demon King waved his wand
and I was dispatched to bring you to him.

599
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,300
Lucky for you, I waited.

600
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,000
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk.

601
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,700
Nasty.

602
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,300
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.

603
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,600
He was.

604
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,000
He told me a magic spell
that would make you come.

605
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,200
What was that?

606
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,300
We're there now.

607
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,100
Thank God.

608
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,500
A new venture of mine.
It's going to be a restaurant.

609
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,400
Do you like it?

610
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,600
Yes. Very nice.

611
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,500
Last night, after you'd gone,
I did a little bit of asking around...

612
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,200
...seeing as you weren't very forthcoming.

613
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,000
It seems you're concerned
about the death of your brother.

614
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,700
I got to thinking how nice it would be
if the bloke you was after...

615
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,900
...was the same bloke
I wanted off my back.

616
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,700
You know my life: machines...

617
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,600
...the arcades. It's a nice business.

618
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,100
It runs itself. People put money in.
I take it out.

619
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,900
There's not much rough stuff.

620
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,600
It's a business that makes me very happy.

621
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,100
Recently, though, I've had a spot of bother.

622
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,200
One of my lads gets a bit overanxious
and flogs some machines...

623
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,100
...to a club that has already got some.

624
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,900
The upshot is I've got to eat shit and
stop flogging my machines to other clubs.

625
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:15,400
As far as I'm concerned, that's it.
Apparently not.

626
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,700
These people I've offended get the idea
that it would be good thing...

627
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,800
...to take over the whole of my outfit,
so I'm worried.

628
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I can't fight them.
I don't have that sort of a setup.

629
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,200
But I've got to fix them before they fix me.

630
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,600
The trouble is, if I try...

631
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,900
...and they find out, I'm dead.

632
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,500
£5,000,000.

633
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,600
That belongs to you.

634
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,500
Along with a little name
I'm going to give you.

635
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,700
What name?

636
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,300
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.

637
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,100
Kinnear did it.

638
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,500
Why?

639
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,000
I don't know.

640
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,500
All I know is there were people
shitting bricks at his place last Saturday.

641
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,600
Your brother's name was mentioned.
Next day, he was dead.

642
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,700
Why?

643
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
-I don't know. That's all I was told.
-That's not good enough.

644
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:13,900
Christ!

645
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,900
Do me a favor.

646
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:21,500
Do you really think I'm going to fix Kinnear
on your say-so?

647
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,300
Just because they put me
onto you last night?

648
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,000
Don't think you can play
the same trick. Stroll on.

649
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,800
Jack, you're wrong.

650
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,600
-Good afternoon, Mr. Brumby.
-Jack!

651
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:17,300
Who is setting you up in this place?

652
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,500
Brumby.

653
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,600
-Is he coming here?
-Don't worry.

654
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,700
He's meeting the architects
at the restaurant.

655
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,900
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?

656
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:40,700
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.

657
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,200
Why does he want
that great big country place for?

658
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,200
Entertaining.

659
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,600
What kind of entertaining?

660
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,800
Now you're asking.

661
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,700
Does Brumby really enjoy that crap?

662
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,500
Especially when I play the lead.

663
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,200
Did Kinnear...

664
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,800
...say anything about me
after I left the other night?

665
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,700
That's why you waited for me?

666
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,000
No, not entirely.

667
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,100
You're sure about that?

668
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,200
Sure, I'm sure.

669
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,300
You bastard.

670
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,700
Glenda!

671
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,800
I'm in the bath.

672
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,300
I want to give you an Oscar.

673
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,700
You've been watching the film.

674
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,800
Tell me about the girl.

675
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,500
What girl?

676
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,900
The young girl. Who pulled her?

677
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,800
I don't know.

678
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,300
Was it Albert?

679
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,400
Shouldn't think so.

680
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,100
-It is one of Kinnear's films?
-Yeah.

681
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,300
Who set it up? Eric?

682
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,900
Yeah.

683
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,500
Then he must have pulled her.

684
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,300
Expect so.

685
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,700
Did my brother Frank...

686
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:29,900
...find out?

687
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,900
Your brother? What are you talking about?

688
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,400
You lying bitch!

689
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,600
Tell me the truth.

690
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,000
The girl's name was Doreen.
That's all I know.

691
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,400
-And you didn't know her last name?
-No.

692
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:03,300
Well, it's Carter. That's my name!

693
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,500
Her father was my brother...

694
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,900
...and he was murdered last Sunday.

695
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:16,800
Now get in there and get dressed.

696
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,800
Get in! In!

697
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:50,300
Where's Albert? Where's Albert?

698
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,500
I know where to find him.

699
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,300
He's come for Albert.

700
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:11,200
<i>I don't know. On the ferry, I reckon.</i>

701
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,400
Hello, Albert.

702
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,800
Hello, Jack.

703
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:41,200
I don't know anything, Jack.

704
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,100
Yes, you do.

705
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,600
Talk, or I'll kill you.

706
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:51,200
I know.

707
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,200
Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert?

708
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,400
Do you want to go to the toilet?

709
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:03,100
Do you want to go to the toilet?

710
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,400
You can't get away from me, Albert.

711
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,800
I know.

712
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,800
For Christ's sake, give us a fag.

713
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,600
I didn't know who Doreen was.

714
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,500
Though she was just another bird.

715
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,900
Did Eric Paice pull her?

716
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:48,800
Yes.

717
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,500
How?

718
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,400
I don't know. Got his ways.
He knows Margaret.

719
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,900
When did you find out?

720
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,700
Couple of weeks back.

721
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,300
How?

722
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,500
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.

723
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,100
Who?

724
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:14,800
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film.
He wanted to meet Doreen.

725
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,000
And you told Brumby?

726
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,100
Who killed Frank?

727
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,200
Do you want to be dead, Albert?

728
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,800
Last Sunday afternoon Eric
and two of his boys arrived with Frank.

729
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,300
They told me he'd rumbled.

730
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,100
Somehow he'd seen the film
and was about to shoot his mouth off.

731
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,200
They asked me for some whisky
and started forcing it down his throat.

732
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,200
I thought they'd just duff him up a bit.
Honest.

733
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,500
What did you do, Albert?

734
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,500
Nothing. What could I do?

735
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?

736
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,900
Yes. I told him.

737
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,600
What did he say?

738
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,200
Good.

739
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:22,200
They drove Frank away in a car.

740
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,600
Is that all there is?

741
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,200
Yes.

742
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,200
That's it then.

743
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,400
Jack, for Christ's sake.

744
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,600
For Christ's sake!

745
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
You knew what I'd do, didn't you, Albert?

746
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,800
Yes, but... Christ! I didn't kill him, did I?

747
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:52,100
I know you didn't kill him. I know!

748
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,800
Put me two bob on Lucky Leap, would you?

749
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,000
No shooters, you stupid bastards!
Cyril said no shooters!

750
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,900
-Do you want to get us all nicked?
-Get stuffed!

751
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:27,500
-Turn it in. Gerald wants to see him first.
-Shut up!

752
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,300
Are you coming in,
or are you gonna piss about all day?

753
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,600
You're bloody finished,
you know that, Jack.

754
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,900
I've finished you.

755
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,700
Not till I'm dead, Eric.

756
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,600
You've still got your sense of humor.

757
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,500
Do you want to tell him
how I've finished him?

758
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,100
He's told Gerald about you and Anna.

759
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:01,800
He didn't believe me at first.
Then Peter talked to him.

760
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Didn't even say goodbye.
Just asked us to take you back.

761
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,200
Alive.

762
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,700
He's probably talking to her right now.

763
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,900
Are you still going to fancy her
when Gerald's finished with her face?

764
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,700
Stay where you are, Peter!

765
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,700
Don't!

766
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,400
Don't!

767
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,900
Carter, your car needs a wash.

768
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:23,100
I don't want them cooking in here.
You can put a hatch in that wall.

769
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:26,300
I can do that, but it's a question of design.

770
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,200
Aesthetically, you've got to use...

771
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,700
Who in Christ's name's that?

772
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,500
A bloody madman!

773
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,600
Extraordinary fellow.

774
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,100
Jack!

775
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,700
You shouldn't have shown the film
to Frank.

776
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,700
It was the only way I could get at them.

777
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,000
You shouldn't have.

778
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,300
Your brother was going to the police.

779
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,500
-You didn't have the guts to do it yourself.
-They'd have killed me.

780
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,700
They killed my brother instead.

781
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,600
I didn't think they'd do it.

782
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:19,300
How would you have liked it...

783
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,100
...if that had been your daughter
being poked in that film?

784
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,800
What would you have done then?

785
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,400
Slags like your Sandra
can get away with it.

786
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,100
Can't they?

787
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,700
The Doreens of this world can't.

788
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:43,300
Can they?

789
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's very rude to disappear like that.
Where can he possibly be?

790
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:48,100
I have an awful feeling we're not going
to get our fees on this job.

791
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,500
The guy on the Swing Bridge.

792
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,800
Okay.

793
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,400
-How did it happen?
-I don't know how it happened.

794
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,300
How far did he fall?

795
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,100
What did Betty say?
90 floors, I think it was.

796
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,500
Really, was he dead?

797
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,600
Yes. Apparently he hit his head
on the pavement.

798
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,600
-Well, he would be, wouldn't he?
-I'm sure.

799
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,000
It's better to go quick like that.

800
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,900
<i>Number 9, Doctor's Orders.</i>

801
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,700
<i>Five and eight, 58.</i>

802
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,600
<i>One and five, 15.</i>

803
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,400
<i>Two and six, 26.</i>

808
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,300

809
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,600
<i>...on 25.</i>

810
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,400
<i>One so f ar on 25.</i>

811
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,400
<i>Anybody else please, for that full house.</i>

812
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,300
<i>Just the one, nobody else?</i>

813
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,800
<i>Checking just one this time.</i>

814
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,700
I've come for you, Margaret.

815
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,500
Who?

816
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,700
Fletcher!

817
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,200
Hold on.

818
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,600
Hello? Gerald?

819
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,500
It's Carter.

820
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:04,700
Now listen carefully, you hairy-faced git!

821
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:11,100
I've got the film and enough evidence
to put you away for a long time.

822
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:16,700
All it takes is one call to the police.

823
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,500
Really?

824
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,100
So?

825
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,800
I'll do a simple deal with you.

826
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,000
All I want...

827
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,900
I see. I think that can be arranged.

828
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,200
But I don't want him there...

829
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:43,800
...until 6:00 in the morning.

830
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,600
Okay?

831
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,400
Right.

832
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,900
Out!

833
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:00,700
You wanted something, Cyril?

834
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:04,900
Yes, Eric. A word with you.

835
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,100
Get out!

836
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,800
Come on. Come on!

837
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,800
Take your clothes off!

838
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,100
Take your clothes off!

839
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,900
Keep your pants on. Lie down.

840
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,800
Lie down!

841
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:22,600
I want you to listen very carefully.
Jack Carter...

842
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,300
Yes.

843
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,100
Do you know what he looks like?

844
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,700
Yeah.

845
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,900
Police.

846
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,200
You couldn't win
an egg-and-spoon race, Eric.

847
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:48,700
Sod off.

848
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:53,400
Stay away from the car
or I'll blow you apart.

849
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,500
Stand up. Stand up!

850
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,900
I bet...

851
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,900
...you could use a drink...

852
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:30,100
...couldn't you, Eric?

853
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,500
Have a drink.

854
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,800
Still got your sense of humor.

855
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,600
Drink up.

856
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,300
Drink up.

857
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,100
I want you...

858
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,300
...to drink all of it.

859
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,000
Do you understand?

860
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,600
Drink it all.

861
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,400
Just like it was...

862
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,200
...with my brother Frank...

863
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,900
What?

864
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,800
Drink up!

865
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,800
Drink up, Eric!

866
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,900
It was you...

867
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,100
It was you who poured it down him,
wasn't it?

868
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:16,200
What? What?

869
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:20,800
Did you all have a good laugh...

870
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:24,300
...while he was spewing up?

871
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:29,215
Drink up! Drink!

872
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:32,205
Drink it!

873
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:34,425
Did you pass the bottle round...

874
01:44:34,715 --> 01:44:38,805
...when the car went over the top, eh?

875
01:44:39,410 --> 01:44:42,110
Goodbye, Eric!
