00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,750
你知道他会不高兴的 You know he's not gonna be happy.

3
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,210
不会 他应该不会不高兴 No I suspect he won't.

4
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,710
杰西 只有你能为自己 做出最好的选择 Only you can decide what's best for you Jesse.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,130
我和他都无法为你做决定 Not him not me.

6
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,600
我不干了 I'm out.

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,650
你打算怎么用那一大笔钱 So what are you gonna do with all that money?

8
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,530
以前怎么用 现在就怎么用 Same thing I do with all the other money.

9
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,700
你呢 年纪轻轻就退休了 How about you teenage retiree?

10
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,240
算是活在梦想中了吧 You'll be living the dream.

11
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,080
我不清楚该不该留在镇上 Not sure I should stick around town.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,370
这只是个开始 That's a start.

13
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,580
这里没什么值得我留下来的原因 Nothing really keeping me here.

14
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,220
你打算去哪 换成是你 你会去哪 Where would you go if you were me?

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,220
我的答案不重要 毕竟我不是你 说真的 你会去哪 Doesn't matter. I'm not you. Seriously come on.

16
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,470
假如像我这般年轻 你会去哪 Like if you were my age?

17
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,180
就当你是我 好吗 聊聊你会去哪 Just play along. Make some conversation.

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,230
阿拉斯加州 Alaska.

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,310
是吗 Yeah?

20
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,730
是啊 换成我像你这般年轻 准备重新开始 我会去阿拉斯加州 Yeah if I were your age starting fresh Alaska.

21
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,110
最后的边疆 It's the last frontier.

22
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,990
在那边 你想成为什么人都行 Up there you could be anything you want.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,740
阿拉斯加州 Alaska.

24
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,160
重新开始 Start over.

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,130
从头来过 改邪 Start fresh. One could.

26
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,550
归正 Put things right.

27
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,260
不可能 No.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,970
小子 不好意思 我们永远不可能改邪归正 Sorry kid that's the one thing you can never do.

29
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,750
老兄 你太逊了 Dude you suck.

30
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,330
好像不受控制 This thing's like defective and shit.

31
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,210
可能是手柄上粘有奇多碎片 Think you got Cheeto dust in the controller.

32
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,840
你这么说话 就像个责怪锤子不够硬的差劲木匠 It's a bad carpenter that blames his hammer yo.

33
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,720
随你怎么说 Whatever.

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,010
你太快把速度推到顶点了 You're apex-ing too early. You're apex-ing too early.

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,850
我在适当的时候加速 不用你教我怎么开车 I'm apex-ing at the apex bitch. Don't be telling me how to drive and shit.

36
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,140
你连一台只有 上下按键的升降梯也不会搭 You couldn't drive a two-button elevator.

37
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,270
你连接送黛西小姐（美国奥斯卡金像奖电影）也不会 You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.

38
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,480
不懂你想表达什么 Whatever that means.

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,480
你连在动物园里 为小朋友开游览小巴士也不会 You couldn't drive a short bus full of slow kids to the zoo.

40
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,570
是啊 因为你让我分心了 Yeah because I'd be too distracted by you.

41
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,740
你坐在巴士前面 带着奇怪的头盔 You'd be sitting up front in your special helmet

42
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,740
想要磨蹭我的大腿 trying to hump my leg.

43
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,080
你无法开车载着路易丝和塞尔玛 冲下山崖 On account you couldn't drive Thelma and Louise off of that cliff.

44
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,080
好梗 Apex!

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,960
不能再加速了 这已经最快了 I can't apex more than I'm already apex-ing.

46
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,370
你开车像个失去双腿的瞎子 You drive like a blind guy with no legs.

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,340
小子 你的开车技术 跟我那个死去的奶奶一样 这也太不敬了吧 Dude you drive like my dead grandmoms. That's disrespectful.

48
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,420
老兄 你迷路了吗 Dude you lost?

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,590
谁来了 Who is it?

50
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,050
你是杰西 Jesse?

51
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,850
谁啊 Who is it?

52
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,230
我不能把车停在大街上 I gotta get that car off the street.

53
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
你搞什么 What the hell yo?

54
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,990
过来看电视一下 Come check out what's on TV.

55
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,410
老兄 你搞什么 我没心情看电视 Man what's wrong with you? I ain't watching no TV right now.

56
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,330
我叫你看新闻 It's the news.

57
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,700
你确定是匪徒使用的是 Is it true that a military-grade firearm was altered

58
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,180
经过改良的军用级武器吗 and used to carry out this attack?

59
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,600
根据我获得的可靠消息 嫌犯手持M60通用机枪 To the best of my knowledge it was an M60 machine gun.

60
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,480
这种枪属于军用级武器 Yes that's strictly a military-issue weapon.

61
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,190
至于嫌犯怎么获得这种武器 As to where he could have obtained such a weapon

62
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,950
或是所谓的“遥控枪” or the so-called uh remote control aspect of it

63
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,530
目前所有分析判断都只是臆测 anything I could say at this point would just be conjecture

64
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,050
我也不便透露详情 and I'm not going to engage in that.

65
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,200
介意告诉我们更多 有关这名嫌犯的资料吗 Could you tell us more about this person of interest?

66
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,210
我们收到很多矛盾的消息 We're hearing a lot of conflicting information

67
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,170
目前不确定嫌犯是否涉及杀人 and I'm unclear whether this person took part in the killings

68
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,420
或是 我们不断听到“释放”这个词 or whether they were in fact I guess the word we keep hearing is "liberated."

69
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,760
这些人是不是被怀特释放的人质呢 Were they liberated by White from some sort of captivity?

70
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,760
目前不便透露太多 I'm not prepared to say any more than that

71
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,180
这些人都是嫌犯 他们可能为此案 they're a person of interest and they may have information relevant to this case

72
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,140
或是缉毒局正在调查的其他案件 提供线索 or other cases the DEA's investigating.

73
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,060
这些人都是肉票 那绑匪的动机是什么 What were the motives of his captors?

74
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,970
目前我们无法做出臆测 Can't speculate on that at this time...

75
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,190
天啊 杰西 是谁 Whoa whoa whoa Jesse! Who's there?

76
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,190

77
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,530
杰西 是我们 你没事 It's us. It's us Jesse you're safe.

78
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,240
是我们 It's us.

79
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,010
我的衣服尺码非常适合你 My stuff's gonna fit you like a T yo.

80
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,640
没必要向这个大脚怪借 Not like if you had to borrow it from Sasquatch over here.

81
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,640
不能怪我 这是为爱而设的尺码 Can't help it that I'm sized for love.

82
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,430
尽管去爱那些长颈鹿吧 狗娘养的 Yeah you go love all the giraffes you want bitch.

83
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,310
女人就留给我和杰西 Me and Jesse are sticking with the ladies.

84
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,360
我很少穿这件外套 你觉得如何 Yeah this here's barely worn. How's this working for you?

85
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,820
不错吧 Good?

86
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,660
杰西 Jesse?

87
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,830
好吧 我去给你买些新衣 Right on. Get you some new clothes then.

88
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,910
去洗个澡可能会舒服点 Shower will make you feel a whole lot better.

89
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
说真的 你看起来很需要洗澡 You look like you're hurting for one.

90
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,550
没错 无意冒犯 Church. No offense.

91
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,300
我把干净的毛巾 放在右边 Got you a clean towel the one on the right. Kind of.

92
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,260
你想用新的香皂尽管用 And feel free to open up a new bar of Irish Spring whatever.

93
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,470
香皂就在下面 It's underneath you know

94
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,350
毕竟用过的那块可能沾有毛发什么的 because the old one might have like hairs on it and shit and uh...

95
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,310
对了 我还有凌仕香水 凯文克莱迷恋男士香水 Yo I got Axe Body Spray. I got Obsession for Men.

96
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,860

想用就尽管用 都拿来试试 Feel free to use any of them you want you know? Use them all.

98
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,860

99
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,950
对了 Oh uh. Hey um...

100
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,790
最好不要剃掉胡须 Maybe don't like shave and whatnot you know?

101
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,540
以免被认出来 懂吗 Be less recognizable?

102
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,920
杰西 他们真的 Jesse did they really...?

103
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,720
想问什么 What?

104
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,390
他们真的把你关在笼子里吗 Did they really keep you in a cage?

105
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,710
天啊 老兄 你怎么 看起来真帅 Whoa dude why'd you...? Looking sharp yo.

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,520
要不要放松一下 You want a little something to take the edge off?

110
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,770
不必 No.

111
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,940
为什么把电视关了 Why'd you uh turn off the TV?

112
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,070
都是坏消息吗 News that bad?

113
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,440
都是太多新闻了 There's just uh... a whole lot of it.

114

对啊 Yeah.

我必须离开这个地方 I gotta get out of here.

116
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,030
你要去哪 你有什么打算吗 Where to? You got a plan?

117
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,620
可能有吧 Maybe.

118
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,720
瘦皮猴 有没有一次性手机 Hey uh Skinny you got a burner you can give me?

119
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,890
满电 不曾用过 Fully charged and clean as a whistle.

120
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,480
首先 我得把车毁掉 First I gotta get rid of that car.

121
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,460
联邦执法机构 尚未确定嫌犯与受害人有何关系 ...connection to the victims and his role in the brutal slayings

122
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,080
也不清楚他在这起血腥事件中 扮演什么角色 remains unconfirmed by federal authorities.

123
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,500
无论如何 奥斯汀警局指出 嫌犯名叫杰西 布鲁斯 平克曼 However APD sources say the suspect is Jesse Bruce Pinkman

124
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,760
此人原本是怀特的学生 后来加入他的贩毒活动 a local man who was a student of White's before joining him in the drug trade.

125
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,340
两人联手犯下了 Together the two were responsible

126
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,680
美国历史上规模最庞大的 for the largest methamphetamine manufacturing operation

127

128
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,890
有消息指出 师生二人曾起争执 Sources speculate the two had a falling out after which it is believed

129
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,060
原因相信跟平克曼 Pinkman was manufacturing the drug

130
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,190
为绑匪制毒有关 我是老乔 with the group holding him captive. Go for Joe.

131
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,030
警方目前正在追捕平克曼 并呼吁民众保持警惕 Police are now on the hunt for Pinkman and urging the community to remain vigilant.

132
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,740

至于钱的方面 我们可以 我不收你的钱 About the money if we could maybe... It's on the house.

139
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,850
好孩子 Good kid.

140
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,770
小事一桩 Least I could do.

141

逊毙了 Drives like a dick.

174
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,020
小獾会把我的雷鸟跑车 开到约300 400公里以外的地方扔掉 Badger drives my T-bird two 300 miles away and ditches it.

175
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,400
你打算逃去墨西哥吗 没有 不去墨西哥 Think you'll be heading to Mexico? No not Mexico.

177
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,950
稍微藏起来 但别藏得太隐秘 必须让警方发现 Hide it kind of but yo don't hide it so good the cops can't find it.

178
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,200
把指纹擦掉 然后搭便车回来 Wipe it down for prints then hitchhike back.

179
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,540
别让人看见你开着那辆车 Do not let nobody see you in that car.

180
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,200
小獾的菲罗跑车给你开 You take Badger's Fiero.

181
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,000
那这辆车呢 这辆车哪也不去 What about this car? It stays right here.

182
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,880
反正警方已经知道它的位置了 Ain't like the cops don't already know where it is.

183
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,290
我会跟他们说你来我们家 I'll tell them you dropped by

184
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,340

我一定能通过测谎仪测试的 I'll pass any lie detector they give me.

187
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,680
就是这么回事 It's what's happening.

188
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,150
你身上有现金吗 You got any cash?

那就什么都不要说 快走吧 Don't say nothing. Just go.

193
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,770
记得系好安全带 不要超速 Seat belt. Speed limit.

194
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,400
你只有三个小时把车开到南部 You got about three hours to get this thing down south.

195
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,940
在那之前 我会守口如瓶 I'll keep my mouth shut till then

196
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,530
但事后 警方就会发出全国通缉令了 but after that they're gonna put an APB out on this bitch.

197
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,360
我会把车开到那边的 I'll get her there.

198
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,280
杰西 好好照顾它 它是个特别的女孩 Take care of her Jesse. She's a special lady.

199
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,200
那辆车像个小丑 That right there is a clown car.

200
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,410
任何一个有自尊心的罪犯 都不会想死在里面 No self-respecting outlaw would ever get caught dead in that thing.

201
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,630
用来做掩饰再适合不过了 That's why it's perfect yo. Deep cover.

202
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,740
老兄 一路顺风 Vaya con Dios amigo.

203
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,730
把卡米诺跑车的钥匙拿来给我看看 Oh uh the El Camino let me see the keys.

204
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,200
等一下 Hold up.

205
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,620
以防被认出来 Just might keep you from getting spotted.

206
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,710
戴上去也无妨吧 Can't hurt right?

谢谢 是 Thanks. Yeah.

219
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,820
KOB电台一直播报说会下雨 Guy on KOB keeps calling for rain.

220
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,410
你觉得会下雨吗 What do you think?

221
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,620
不知道 Uh... I don't know.

222
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,830
气象播报员说 昨天有百分之四十的几率会下雨 Guy said like 40 percent chance yesterday.

223
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,210
今天则说有百分之六十的几率会下雨 Sixty percent today.

224
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,510
我认为昨天才是百分之五十吧 Maybe it was even 50 yesterday.

225
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,550
可是到现在 But so far I mean I...

226

我只看到云 Yeah I see clouds

227
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,020
也不像乌云 只是一般的 but I wouldn't call them rain clouds just regular...

228
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,480
只是一般的云 Regular "cloud" clouds.

229
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,770
在我看来是一般的云 Anyway that's what they look like to me.

230
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,530
气象播报员的话都不太可信 Yeah well those guys aren't always that accurate.

231
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,530
对啊 Yeah right.

232
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,580
我并不觉得自己是什么专家 或是诸如此类的人 I'm not putting myself out there as any kind of expert or whatnot

233
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,710
不过我有很强烈的预感 今天下午会有好天气 but I do think it's gonna be a beautiful afternoon.

杰克叔叔带大伙儿到象山去了 Yeah Uncle Jack took everybody down to Elephant Butte

238
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,440
他买了一台新的查帕拉尔冲浪小快艇 on account of he got this new Chaparral.

239
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,110
太帅了 不过我跟他说 我不太喜欢滑水运动 It's pretty badass but I told him I'm not really big into waterskiing.

240
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,200
况且 总得有人看守你 Plus somebody's gotta take care of you.

241
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,910
我花了好些时间说服他 Took some convincing...

242
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,710
不过 如今整个周末 这里只剩下你和我 but now it's just you and me the whole weekend.

其实 我不喜欢 So I hate to be all like...

245
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,310
我们必须先说好规矩 But we gotta talk ground rules.

246
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,770
要是你敢逃跑的话 Uh if you tried to you know escape...

247
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,820
我只好去找那个小男孩了 I'm gonna have to visit the little boy.

248
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,280
到时事情就不在我的控制范围之内了 It'll basically be out of my hands at that point.

249
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,620
杰克叔叔跟你说好了 他希望自己说到也能做到 Uncle Jack made you that promise and he's gonna want to stick to it.

250
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,620

杰西 感激不尽 I appreciate it Jesse.

254
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,020
我要确保你 Gotta make sure you don't...

255
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,730
不会太惹人注目 draw too much attention.

256
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,570
我以后会更加关注你的卫生 好吗 I'm gonna do a better job of keeping you clean from now on okay?

257
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,950
我答应你 Promise.

258
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,410
Take a drive along the beach

259
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,330
 Or stay at home and watch TV

260
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,290
 You see It really doesn't matter much to me

261
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,420
 I'm not talking about moving in

262
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,210
And I don't want to change your...

263

过来看看 Hey check this out.

265
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,700
没水 There's no water in it.

266
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,610
以前有水的 但几年前基于保险制度问题 There used to be but they took it out a couple years ago

267
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,160
而被清空了 because of some insurance thing.

268
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,250
行了 其实不会太重 Okay so it's not actually that heavy

269
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:31,460
只是 我试过了 自己一个人搬不动 but uh try as I might I can't ever get this thing on by myself.

270
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,880
你比较想站在前面还是后面 What are you better at going forwards or backwards?

271
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,300
那就先试着打横吧 Okay well let's both go sideways for a while.

我想过把它挂在天花板上 I thought maybe I could just hang it from the ceiling here...

274
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,360
然后把车开到下面 再把盖子放下来 and just drive right under and drop it in

275
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,620
但是这么做 房东会不高兴 but my landlord didn't really like that idea.

276
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
应该可以了 I guess that's good.

277
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,380

301
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,830
没人 Nope not that I know of.

302
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,750
嗨 路易 最近在忙什么 Hey there Lou. What you up to?

303
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,880
最近在做些园艺活 A little horticultural maintenance.

304
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,130
你的无花果树看起来有点不健康 This uh ficus down at your end has been looking kind of puny.

305
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,170
别让虫子爬上去 Gotta keep the thrip bugs off it.

306
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,630
无花果树到底是一种盆栽 还是一种树 So is a ficus technically a plant or a tree?

307
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,260
看情况吧 I'd say it all depends.

308
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,180
别忘了无花果树有超过800种 Uh keep in mind you got over 800 species of the darned thing.

309
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,850

311
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,490
天啊 Oh man.

312
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,210
那个家伙 平常这个时候他都不在家的 That guy. He's not supposed to be home at this hour.

313
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,580
幸好他没看到你 We really lucked out that he didn't see you.

314
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,720
这家伙平常到处走来走去 老爱多管闲事 He's just always lurking around being nosy.

315
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,350
我尊重他是越战军人 只是 I mean he was in Vietnam which I totally respect but still...

316
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,520
你觉得我的家怎么样 How you like my place?

317
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,230
不错 Uh yeah it's... It's nice.

318
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,730
有点偏向粉色系 不过搭配得宜 Kind of... pastel. But in a good way.

319
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,400
是吗 我的灵感来自于复活节彩蛋 Yeah right? I was thinking of Easter eggs.

320
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,160
可是 最近我想尝试新的漆色 But lately I'm thinking I might like to try some new paint.

321
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,910
我开始嫌这种色调有点沉闷了 This stuff is starting to feel pretty tired.

322
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,540
很好 Okay.

323
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,420
你带我来这里 就是为了帮你上漆吗 Sure so you... Is that why I'm here? You want me to help you paint?

324
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,340
可以这么说吧 前提是有多余的时间 Maybe yeah um... if we have some time left over.

325
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,960
但当务之急 But first uh...

330
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,280
搞什么 What...?

331
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,650
该死 Oh shit!

332
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:17,910
请你不要 我已经够难受了 求你不要再让我更难受 Okay please don't you know make me feel worse than I already do.

333
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,620
这个人是谁 Who is this?

334
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,040
她是清洁女工索尼娅 Sonia my cleaning lady.

335
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,340
说真的 我不想再提到她了 And honestly I don't feel much like talking about it so...

336
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,550
杰西 你可以帮我这个忙吗 You want to give me a hand Jesse?

337
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,060
不要弄弯 Just keep it straight.

338
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,480
等一下 Oh uh wait. Uh...

339
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,200
打开来 Unroll it.

340
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,670
稍后可能用得上 I kind of need this.

341
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,010
行了 Okay.

342
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,440
只要等路易去打保龄球后 就可以行动了 Now we just gotta wait for nosy Lou to go bowling.

343
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,150
他应该会在一个小时后离开 I think he leaves in like an hour.

344
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,520
要喝点汤吗 You want some soup?

345
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
要喝汤吗 You want soup?

346
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,660
我有鸡汤面 星面浓鸡汤 奶油鸡汤 I got chicken noodle chicken and stars cream of chicken.

347
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,870
红豆培根汤 Ah bean with bacon.

348
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,080
杰西 剩下一罐了 One left Jesse.

349
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,880
她对你做了什么 什么 What did she do to you? What?

350
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,170
她没对我做过什么 Oh she didn't do anything to me.

351
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,220
那 为什么 Then... why?

352
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,480
你看那边 Right there.

353
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,350
假如你很想知道她的死因 就去看那本书吧 That book if you wanna know so bad.

354
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,320
杰克叔叔教过我 要把钱带在身边 Uncle Jack taught me always keep my money close

355
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,950
我有一整套的世界百科全书 so I have these old World Book Encyclopedias

356
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,080
从A到Z都有 the whole entire set A to Z.

357
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,380
是我奶奶送的 那年我念初中 My grammy gave them to me when I was in middle school

358
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,670
我心想 大家只会上网找资料 也没有人会看书了 but I figured nobody needs books anymore because everything's on the computer.

359
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,130
所以把钱藏在书里应该安全 Uh it seemed like a good hiding place.

360
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,970
加上我有好几本书可以藏钱 Plus I had all these other volumes left to fill.

361
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,520
这个清洁女工偷了你的钱吗 So your cleaning lady was stealing your money?

362
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,650
什么 不是 What? No.

363
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,860
她生前是个非常老实的人 She was as honest as the day is long.

364
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,860
堪比乔治华盛顿 Like George Washington honest.

365
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,750
可是钱被她发现了 我不能容许有人发现这些钱 But she found it and I can't have anybody finding it.

366
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,000
她发现后直接把钱带到我面前 She brought it straight in here to show me.

367
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,340
她以为我不知道书里有钱 She actually thought I didn't know it was there.

368
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,050
我只是好奇 她想透过百科全书了解什么 I just... I wonder what the heck she was looking up.

369
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,840
她连英语都说不好 She barely spoke any English.

370
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,300
封面写着“M” 可能是指“墨西哥”吧 我不清楚 M for Mexico maybe? I don't know.

371
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,930
感觉怪怪的 It's weird.

372
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,060
我们打算把她送去什么地方 Where are we gonna take her?

373
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,480
一个漂亮的地方吧 Someplace pretty.

374
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,730
她值得葬在漂亮的地方 She deserves that.

375
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,280
帮我把书放回去 好吗 Hey do me a favor and put that away would you?

376
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,370
往走廊直走到最后一个房间 里面有个大书架 Just straight down the hall all the way in the back there's a whole shelf of them.

377
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,370
谢谢 Thanks.

378
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,700
你真的不想喝汤 Sure you don't want any soup?

379
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,930
你觉得我的卧室怎么样 How you like my bedroom?

380
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,060
漂亮吧 Pretty bitchen huh?

381
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,490
一定要按照字母顺序排列 Be sure to alphabetize them.

382
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,350
看来我最好找个新地方把钱藏起来 Guess I better come up with a new hiding place for my money.

383
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,440
有个地方叫银行 They got these things called banks.

384
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,950
其实 我知道最适合的地方在哪里 Actually I think I know the perfect spot.

385
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,790
需要用上一点工程设计技巧 It might take a little engineering...

386
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,420
那个地方就是自己家 绝对不会有人发现 but man it would be right here and nobody would ever find it.

387
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,970
“没什么比现金更实在了” 这是杰克叔叔说的 "Nothing beats cash on hand" that's what Uncle Jack says.

388
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,850
一个普通的孩子 ...an average kid.

389
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,550
对啊 他以前喜欢画画 他画得不错 Yeah. I mean he liked to draw. He was good at that.

390
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,130
最后一次看到他是什么时候 When was the last time you saw him?

391
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,590
（嫌犯父母 亚当平克曼和戴安平克曼）

392
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,100
一年前吧 可能更久 那时这些事都还没发生 A year. Maybe more. I mean it was way before all of this.

393
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,600
你有什么话想对儿子说吗 Is there anything you wish you could say to your son right now?

394
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,610
请你 自首吧 Please come forward.

395
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,150

396
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:41,540
就当是为了自己 为了大家 儿子 自首吧 For your sake for everybody's sake son turn yourself in.

397
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,020
You're looking kind of lonely girl

398
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,900
 Would you like someone new to talk to?

399
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,360
 Ah yeah all right

400
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,910
 I'm feeling kind of lonely too If you don't mind

401
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,330
 Can I sit down here beside you?

402
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,960
 Ah yeah all right

403
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,800
 If I seem to come on too strong

404
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,430
 I hope that you will understand

405
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,930
 I say these things 'Cause I'd like to know

406
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,890
 If you're as lonely as I am

407
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,940

 We could bring in the morning girl

413
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,540
 If you want to go that far

414
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,460
 And if tomorrow finds us together

415
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,460
 Right here the way we are

416
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,010
 Would you mind

你想对死者说几句话吗 You wanna say a few words?

422
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,940
不必了 No.

423
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,860
她是个好女人 Nice nice lady.

424
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,620
也是个出色的清洁女工 Excellent housekeeper.

425
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,680
把另一包也拿出来 好吗 Hey grab another pack would you?

557
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,700

我不想碰着 担心指纹留在上面 Didn't want to touch it speaking of fingerprints.

563
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,100
你们随时可以来查看 You're welcome to come examine it.

01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,480
我连现在是哪个月份也不知道 Look I don't even know what month it is.

729
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,980
他们逼我看他们 They made me watch when they...

730
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,530
怎么开枪杀人 When they shot someone...

731
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:38,410
如果你想博人同情 If you believe that you can pull on people's heartstrings

732
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:41,620
就应该去向警方自首 you should take your chances with the police.

733
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,750
在我看来 路是自己走出来的 From where I sit you made your own luck.

734
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:48,870
你的前伙伴也是 你的律师也是 As did your former partner. As did your lawyer.

735
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,670
你自己说的 说话算数 You said it yourself a deal's a deal.

736
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,800
不行 No.

737
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,640
我哪也不去 I am not going anywhere.

738
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,600
我就赖着不走 直到你愿意帮我为止 I am staying right here until you help me.

739
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,530
你在干什么 What are you doing?

01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,370
喂 Hi yes.

741
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:28,620
店里来了个年轻人 他赖着不走 There's a young man in my store and he refuses to leave.

742
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,040
不要 Hey stop.

743
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,790

744
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,340
对 他可能有武器 够了 Yeah he might be armed. Stop it.

745
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,920
不会太明显 对 我开始感到威胁 Uh not overtly. But uh yes I'm beginning to feel threatened.

746
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:40,260
你认真的吗 Are you serious?

747
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:43,100
没问题 我叫艾德加尔布赖斯 Sure. My name is Ed Galbraith.

748
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:49,730
我是最佳品质吸尘器公司的老板 第四街 门牌2714 I own Best Quality Vacuum 2714 4th Street.

749
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,900
在西北部 没错 Northwest. That's correct.

750
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:56,530
希望你们能尽快派人过来 I would appreciate it very much if you'd send someone immediately.

751
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:17,050
满口胡言 You are so full of crap.

752
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,130
你刚才没打给任何人 你是装出来的 You didn't call anybody just now. You faked it.

753
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,640
知道我怎么发现吗 And you wanna know how I know?

754
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,760
不然你失去的会跟我一样多 You got as much to lose as I do.

755
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,600
或许更多 More. Way more.

756
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,810
当你所谓的“警察”来到把我抓起来后 When your "cops" get here and they bust me

757
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:34,980
他们首先会问你我来这里干什么 first question they're gonna ask is what am I doing here

758
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,530
为什么要把一袋现金交给 trying to hand over a Hefty bag full of cash

759
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:40,820
一个经营吸尘器店的老板 to a dude who runs a vacuum cleaner store.

760
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,030
你认为结果会如何 What comes out then? Huh?

761
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,910
你知道还有哪些是废话吗 Oh and you uh wanna know what else is bullshit?

762
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:49,870
这是我给你的金玉良言 You know like word to the wise

763
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:53,710
下次你想再搞这种把戏 next time you try to pull this shit on someone

764
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,750
打去911后 不要马上挂掉 you don't just hang up on a 911 call.

765
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,050
警察不会让你挂电话的 They won't let you.

766
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:03,880
因为对方会叫：“先生 不要挂电话 Because the lady or dude or whoever is like "Stay on the line with me sir.

767
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:07,510
在警察抵达前 请你不要挂电话” Stay on the line until the officers arrive."

768
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,180
如果你真的挂了电话 And if you did hang up

769
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:11,270
他们会马上打回来 they'd call you back immediately.

770
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:13,520
可是他们有打回来吗 But hey guess what.

771
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,190

警官 十分感谢你们迅速赶来 Officers thank you very much for getting here so fast.

775
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,050
他显然听见我报警 他还在吗 He obviously heard my call and... Is he still here?

776
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,430
不在 他已经离开了 我 No he's not. He's gone. I uh...

777
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:50,640
他看见我打电话 就被吓跑了 He was spooked by my phone call

778
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,140
大概30秒前 and he headed up northbound uh...

779

他往北部跑去了 on foot maybe 30 seconds ago.

780
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,190
你可以形容他的长相吗 没问题 Can you describe him? Sure I can.

781
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,770

我在上面这边加了一条鱼尾板  一条在中间 另一条在后面 Added a fishplate up here one in the middle one down at the end.

875
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,800
加了什么 一条鱼尾板 Added a what? A fishplate.

876
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,680
什么 “鱼尾板”是什么 What like a plate of fish?

877
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,590
搞什么 有“鱼尾板”这个词吗 What the fuck is that? Is that a real word?

878
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,100
听好 我要多一些这种东西 就是这种镶在侧边的横条 Look man I want more of those things the sideway diagonal things.

879
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:58,850
我要多加一倍 Like twice as many.

880
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:00,270
你是指角撑板吧 Those are gussets.

881
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,310
已经够多了 You got enough of them already.

882
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:07,110
角撑板的问题解决了 那我要一条鱼尾板来干什么 Okay yeah. So gussets I got out the ass but a fishplate I need because what

883
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:09,650
因为我是天主教徒 星期五要吃鱼吗 I'm Catholic and it's Friday?

884
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:14,410
尼尔 你确定不能 再加多几个角撑板吗 You sure you couldn't just put a few more gussets up there Neil?

885
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:17,490
加多几个也无妨吧 钱是你们的 What could it hurt right? Hey it's your money.

886
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,660
我刚才所做的一切 根本没有必要 But what I just did you don't even need that.

887
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:21,290
我当初建这个玩意时绝对没出错 I told you I built this thing right.

888
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:26,460
不是我要贬低你出色的焊接功夫 Heh-heh. Look bro I'm not like impugning on your precious welding skills.

889
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:30,210
只是这是特殊情况 It's just we have a uh unique situation here.

890
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:42,100
这家伙曾企图逃跑一次 Tried to rabbit on us once already.

891
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,230
我想他迟早会想到办法弄断这个玩意 I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way to break this thing.

892
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:47,860
开什么玩笑 You kidding me?

893
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:48,980
凭他 Him?

894
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:53,360
对啊 我觉得这个部分开始有点弯了 就是这边 你看 Yeah it's just I feel it flexing a little bit. A bit right here look.

895
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:56,950
看见了吗 就是那边 Yeah see? Right there.

896
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:58,200
开始有点弯了 Yeah a little bit.

897
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:02,950
我看不出来 那可是一条10公分厚的槽钢 Yeah I don't see jack shit flexing. That's 4-inch channel iron up there.

898
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,960
足以吊起一辆福特F150皮卡车 You could hang an F-150 from it

899
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,170
然后当成沙滩球一样甩来甩去 and shove it back and forth like a beach ball.

900
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:10,380
不可能会出问题的 你和那条10公分槽钢没问题 It's going nowhere. Oh okay you and your big four inches.

901
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,340
是这个兔崽子太健壮了 It's just this little bastard's wiry.

902
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:16,340
管他有多健壮 尽管试试 I don't care how wiry he is. Have him knock himself out.

903
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,350
是吗 Oh yeah?

904
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:21,850
要用钱打赌吗 Wanna put your money where your mouth is?

905
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:26,440
要是他当场把这个玩意扯断 你就给我50美元 Fifty bucks says he breaks this thing right here right now.

906
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,440
给了50美元后 Fifty plus...

907
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:32,110
你还要加多几个 所谓的“角撑板” 对吧 then you gotta put up more of those uh... What'd you call them gussets?

908
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:33,320
免费 No charge.

909
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,650
顺便加多几个鱼尾板 Throw in some fishplates too while you're at it.

921
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:11,900
肯尼 要是他摔断了腿 就不能制毒了 Kenny if he breaks his leg he's not gonna be able to cook.

这地方根本不该来 It wasn't even worth it.

954
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:37,130
我要用好几个小时 才能把泥巴清理干净 It's gonna take me hours to get the mud out.

01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:14,370
杨百翰出生的时候 可卡因还没出现呢 cocaine wasn't even invented when Brigham Young was born.

958
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,620
没关系 你可以吸一些” It's okay. You can have some."

959
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,670

他不会还给你了 他开始有反应了 You'll never get that back. There he goes.

962
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,010
这种毒品叫“黑钻” 再见了 可卡因 Black diamond. Bye-bye cocaine.

963
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:27,640
他只要可卡因和摩门教徒 He's all cocaine and Mormons.

964
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,560
I ain't got me nobody

是吗 Oh yeah?

969
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:13,970
三分一不够用 That three-way split didn't quite cover it for me.

970
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,770
希望你们能帮得上忙 I'd appreciate you helping me out.

971
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:19,440
他到底在说什么 三分一 What's he talking about? Three-way split?

972
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,690
你是说还有另外三分一的钱 You mean there was a third more?

973
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:23,940
而你把那份给了他 And you gave it to him?

974
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:26,570
说来话长 It's a long story.

975
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:28,910
什么叫“说来话长” Well uh what long story?

976
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:31,620
我离开的时候 他手上根本没有枪 When I left he didn't even have a fucking gun.

977
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,830
现在有了 不是吗 Well he's got one now doesn't he?

980
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:43,590
我叫你们都闭嘴 "Shut up" means everybody.

981

告诉我 你打算怎么完成任务 Now how exactly do you plan on pulling this off?

982
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:55,970
我们有五个人 对付你一个人 I mean being that there's five of us and one of you.

983
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:59,520

987
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,610
我是来向你们 I'm asking as a...

988
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,780
求助的 A favor.

989
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,410
什么 要我们做善事吗 Oh what like charity?

990
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:17,580
在我看来 他已经私吞了一大笔钱 Seems to me this silly son of a bitch already forked over bigtime.

991
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,500
凯西 我是认真的 给我闭嘴 Casey seriously shut up.

你要1800美元 是吗 Eighteen hundred huh?

993
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:25,000
为什么不干脆要个2000美元呢 Why not an even 2 grand?

994
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:26,800
要个漂亮的整数不好吗 You know nice round number.

995
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,720
我只需要1800美元 Eighteen hundred's all I need.

996
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,300
为什么带那把枪来 So what's the gun for?

997
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,300
自卫吗 It's like personal protection?

01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:49,280
天啊 Jesus!

1003

1004
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:54,490
好可爱的小玩意 Oh well it's adorable.

1005
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:58,160
这边有些空啤酒罐 要不要玩射击游戏 I know we got empty beer cans around here if you wanna do some plinking.

1008
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,340
就这么简单 Simple as that.

1009
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:08,920
尼尔 我对天发誓 Neil I swear to God

1010
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:12,340
要是你敢多给他一美元 我就 if you give this piece of shit one more dollar...

01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:50,800
我那份放在那个文件柜 最高一层抽屉里的一个行李袋中 My third is in a duffel bag in the top drawer of that file cabinet.

1014
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,380

01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,000
 Am I hearing things?

1161
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:53,300
 Or in the next room

1162
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:57,050
 Did a long-forgotten music box Just start playing?

1163
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:59,180
 And I know

1164
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:02,930
 It's a sin putting words In the mouths of the dead

1165
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:04,970
 And I know

1166
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:08,730
 It's a crime to weave your wishes Into what they said

1167
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:11,100
 And I know

1168
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:14,690
 Only fools venture Where them spirits tread

1169
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:16,860
 'Cause I know

1170
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:19,910
 Every word every sound Bouncing 'round my head

1171
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:22,280
 Is just static on the radio

1172
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:28,040
 Static on the radio Radio

1173
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:30,210
 Static on the radio

1174
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:36,050
 Static on the radio Radio

1175
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:38,260
 Static on the radio

1176
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:44,010
 Everything I think I know Is just static on the radio

1177
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,180
 Static on the radio

1178
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:48,560
 Everything I think I know

1179
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:53,400
 Is just static on the radio

1180
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,690
 Midnight rendezvous

1181
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:58,190
 With a pretty girl

1182
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:02,030
 Wearing a torn and tear-stained gown

1183
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:06,030
 Like a ghost ship She appeared from nowhere

1184
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:09,960
 On a lonely highway and flagged me down

1185
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:14,290
 I gave her a lift downtown To the Greyhound station

1186
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:17,090
 Under the flicker of the neon light

1187
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:20,130
 She kissed me goodbye

1188
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:25,640
 And in the mirror of her eyes I saw my own reflection

1189
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:28,100
 And I know

1190
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:31,480
 The blind will sometimes lead the blind

1191
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,980
 And I know

1192
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:37,440
 Through shadowlands and troubled times

1193
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,900
 And I know

1194
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:43,320
 Forsaking love we see it's a sign

1195
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:45,870
 And I know

1196
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:48,740
 Of truths forever hid behind

1197
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:50,750
 Static on the radio

1198
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:56,630
 Static on the radio Radio

1199
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:58,670
 Static on the radio

1200
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:04,470
 Static on the radio Radio

1201
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:06,800
 Static on the radio

1202
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,850
 Everything I think I know

1203
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:12,640
 Is just static on the radio Radio

1204
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:14,770
 Static on the radio

1205
01:59:14,850 --> 01:59:17,020
 Everything I think I know

1206
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:22,570
 Is just static on the radio Radio

1207
01:59:57,150 --> 01:59:59,520
 Now there's a church house

1208
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:01,480
 About a stone's throw down

1209
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:05,030
 From this place where I been staying

1210
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:07,450
 It's Sunday morning

1211
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:09,740
 And I'm sittin' in my truck

1212
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:13,080
 Listening to my neighbor sing

1213
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:17,120
 Ten years ago I might have joined in

1214
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:21,040
 But don't time change those inclined

1215
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:25,010
 To think less of what is written

1216
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:29,010
 Than what's wrote between the lines

1217
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:31,760
 'Cause I know

1218
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:35,060
 Dreams are for those Who are asleep in bed

1219
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:37,230
 And I know

1220
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:40,980
 It's a sin putting words In the mouths of the dead

1221
02:00:41,060 --> 02:00:42,940
 'Cause I know

1222
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:46,780
 For all my ruminations I can't change a thing

1223
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:49,280
 Still I hope

1224
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,200
 There's others out there That are listening

1225
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:54,410
 To the static on the radio

1226
02:00:54,490 --> 02:01:00,250
 Static on the radio Radio

1227
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:02,340
 Static on the radio

1228
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,630
 Everything I think I know

1229
02:01:04,710 --> 02:01:08,170
 Is just static on the radio Radio

1230
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:09,880
 Static on the radio

1231
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,390
 Ain't praying for miracles

1232
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:16,020
 I'm just down on my knees Radio

1233
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:18,140
 Static on the radio

1234
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:20,150
 Listening for the song behind

1235
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:23,860
 Radio Everything I think I know

1236
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:25,020
 Static on the radio

1237
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:27,860
 Everything I think I know

1238
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:32,910
 Static on the radio Is just static on the radio

1239
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:36,120
 Everything I think I know

1240
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:42,790
Is just static on the radio
