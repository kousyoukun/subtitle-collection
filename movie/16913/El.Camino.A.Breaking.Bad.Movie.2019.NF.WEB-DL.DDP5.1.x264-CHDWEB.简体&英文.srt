138
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,510
是啊
Yeah.

139
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,960
我得走了
I gotta get out of here.

140
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,030
去哪儿啊  你有计划吗
Where to? You got a plan?

141
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,040
也许吧
Maybe.

142
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,250
瘦子
Hey, uh, Skinny,

143
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,320
有一次性手机给我用吗
you got a burner you can give me?

144
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,760
充满电了  还很干净
Fully charged and clean as a whistle.

145
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,020
第一步  我得处理掉那辆车
First, I gotta get rid of that car.

146
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,820
...对受害者  他在这场血腥屠杀中的角色
...to the victims and his role in their brutal slayings

147
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,550
联邦警方并未给予说明
remains unconfirmed by federal authorities.

148
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,900
不过当地警方说
However, APD sources say

149
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,000
嫌疑人是杰西・布鲁斯・平克曼
the suspect is Jesse Bruce Pinkman,

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,910
他是当地居民  也是怀特的学生
a local man who was a student of White's

151
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,050
之后和他一起加入贩毒
before joining him in the drug trade.

152
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,800
两人联手组织了
Together, the two were responsible

153
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,260
美国历史上最大的
for the largest methamphetamine

154
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,390
冰毒生产活动
manufacturing operation in US history.

155
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,180
线人称二人不睦
Sources speculate the two had a falling out,

156
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,710
因为平克曼被人监禁
after which it is believed Pinkman was manufacturing the drug

157
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,350
-被迫为其制毒  -有事找乔
- for the group holding him captive. - Go for Joe.

158
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,250
警方正在追捕平克曼
Police are now on the hunt for Pinkman

159
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,430
并敦促社区提高警惕
and urging the community to remain vigilant.

160
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,040
若任何人有线索
They're asking anyone with information

161
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,020
-请联系阿尔布开克警方...  -我知道是谁
- to contact APD or call Crimestoppers... - Yeah, I know who this is.

162
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,990
现在谁不知道你
At this point, who doesn't?

163
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,950
-"受害者"呢  -在后院
- Where's the victim? - It's in the back.

164
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,200
谢谢你帮我  乔
Look, thank you so much for doing this, Joe.

165
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,310
钱的话  可不可以...
About the money, if we can maybe--

166
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,690
免费
It's on the house.

167
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,680
好孩子
Good kid.

168
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,350
小事一桩
Least I can do.

169
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,610
小心点  蠢货
Watch it, bitch!

170
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,900
你俩当时给我找了不少活儿干
You gentlemen threw me plenty of business back in the day.

171
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,860
我没啥好抱怨的
I got no complaints in that department.

172
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,170
"磁铁"
"Magnets!"

173
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,170
没错
Yeah.

174
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,620
那招真不错
That was a good one. So...

175
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,610
我现在可以实话跟你说
Frankly, you know, I can tell you now,

176
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,920
当时我根本没信心那能成功
I had zero confidence that that would work.

177
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,470
一点也没有  但是  真是给我上了一课啊
None whatsoever, but hey, live and learn.

178
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,790
乔  你在干嘛
Joe, what are you doing?

179
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,870
给我自己上一道保险
Writing myself a little insurance policy.

180
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,990
谨慎起见
You know, strictly precautionary.

181
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,320
事无巨细
Belt and suspenders.

182
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,080
好了
Okay.

183
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,790
放轻松  应该没问题了
All right, mind at ease, think we're good.

184
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,810
乔  乔
Joe! Joe!

185
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,160
等等
Wait.

186
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,130
乔  你要干嘛
Joe, what are you doing?

187
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,050
逃命  你也快逃吧
Fleeing, and I suggest you do the same.

188
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,650
路捷公司的车辆防盗系统刚刚启动了
LoJack. The company just activated it, just this minute.

189
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,550
真是巧啊
Talk about timing.

190
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,310
-能不能...  -警察已经收到报警
- Just-- - Look, Johnny Law is on his way,

191
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,970
很快就到
as in here, as in now.

192
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,220
永别了  再见了  很抱歉
So farewell, goodbye, regrets,

193
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,700
不说了
etcetera etcetera.

194
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,970
乔
Joe!

195
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,480
瘦子
Skinny...

196
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,840
对不起
Sorry.

197
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,880
车钥匙在谁那儿
Who's got the keys to that car?

198
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,650
钥匙
Keys!

199
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,120
你要干嘛  我们得把这车处理掉
What are you doing? We gotta get this thing outta here.

200
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,020
猴子  你那辆车的钥匙给我
Badger, give me the keys to your Fiero.

201
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,000
为啥
Why?

202
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,670
你开我的车
You take my car.

203
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,950
我才不喜欢你的车
I don't even like your car.

204
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,890
开起来那么不顺手
Drives like a dick.

205
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,270
猴子把我的雷鸟开到三四百公里以外扔掉
Badger drives my T-bird 200, 300 miles away and ditches it.

206
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,710
你要去墨西哥吗
Think you'll be heading to Mexico?

207
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,300
不去
No, not Mexico.

208
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,060
那更好
Right on, even better.

209
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,240
丢在离边境线近点的地方
Leave it near the border.

210
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,140
藏起来
Hide it, kind of,

211
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,070
但不用藏太好  让警察能找到
but, yo, don't hide it so good the cops can't find it.

212
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,300
把指纹抹掉  然后搭便车回来
Wipe it down for prints, then hitchhike back.

213
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,580
别让人看到你在那辆车里
Do not let nobody see you in that car.

214
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,220
-你开猴子的车  -那这辆车呢
- You, take Badger's Fiero. - What about this car?

215
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,930
别动它
It stays right here.

216
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,860
好像警察不知道车在哪似的
Ain't like the cops don't already know where it is.

217
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,260
我会告诉他们你来过  我俩大抽特抽
I'll tell 'em you dropped by, the two of us smoked a fat bowl,

218
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,290
交换了车  然后你就走了
traded pink slips, then you split.

219
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,460
我一直想要一辆卡米诺
I always wanted me an El Camino.

220
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,090
说得过去的
And that's church, yo.

221
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,460
测谎仪怎么测我都能过
I'll pass any lie detector they give me.

222
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,040
就这么干
It's what's happening.

223
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,380
你有现金吗
You got any cash?

224
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,590
全拿出来  贱人
Kick in, bitch.

225
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,720
我就这个意思  老天
I'm doing it. Jesus!

226
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,400
兄弟们  我无话可说
Guys, I don't know what to say.

227
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,810
别废话了  走吧
Don't say nothing. Just go.

228
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,490
系好安全带  注意限速
Seat belt. Speed limit.

229
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,810
你有大约三小时开车南下
You got about three hours to get this thing down south.

230
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,720
在那之前我口风会很紧  但之后
I'll keep my mouth shut till then, but after that,

231
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,660
他们会全境通告搜寻这辆破车
they gonna be putting a APB out on this bitch.

232
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,790
我会成功的
I'll get her there.

233
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,840
照顾好我的爱车  杰西
Take care of her, Jesse.

234
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,230
这辆车很特别
She's a special lady.

235
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,220
那辆车花里胡哨的
That right there is a clown car.

236
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,500
想活命的逃犯
No self-respecting outlaw

237
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,590
都不会开那种车招摇的
would ever get caught dead in that thing.

238
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,980
所以是很完美的掩护
That's why it's perfect, yo. Deep cover.

239
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
与上帝同在  伙计
Vaya con Dios, amigo.

240
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,050
给我卡米诺的钥匙
The El Camino, let me see the keys.

241
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,360
等等
Hold up.

242
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,930
让你不那么显眼
Just might keep you from getting spotted.

243
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,020
总比没有强吧
Can't hurt, right?

244
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
瘦子
Yo, Skinny.

245
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,360
你为什么帮我
Why you doing all this?

246
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,200
老哥
Dude...

247
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,330
你可是我的英雄
you're my hero and shit.

248
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,090
杰西
Jesse?

249
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,410
你醒着吗
You awake?

250
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,500
杰西
Jesse?

251
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,280
是
Yeah.

252
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,540
还好吧
Everything good?

253
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,680
是
Yeah.

254
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,810
-好  -好的
- Good. - Great.

255
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,130
来根烟吗
You want a cigarette?

256
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,930
-谢谢  -客气
- Thanks. - Yeah.

257
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,620
电视台的预报员总说要下雨
Guy on KOB keeps calling for rain.

258
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,340
你觉得呢
What do you think?

259
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,460
不知道
I don't know.

260
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,230
预报员说昨天有四成可能
Guy said like forty percent chance yesterday.

261
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,100
今天有六成
Sixty percent today.

262
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,410
或许昨天就是五成了
Maybe it was even fifty yesterday.

263
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,040
但目前
But so far,

264
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,540
我看这个云
I mean, I-- Yeah, I see clouds,

265
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,660
我觉得那不是雨云  就是一般的
but I wouldn't call 'em rain clouds, just regular...

266
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,440
正常的云
regular cloud-clouds.

267
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,130
反正我是这么觉得的
Anyway, that's what they look like to me.

268
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,530
预报员们
Yeah, well, those guys aren't...

269
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,380
不总是准确
always that accurate.

270
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,890
没错
Yeah, right.

271
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,640
我没把自己当成是专家什么的
I'm not putting myself out there as any kind of expert or whatnot,

272
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,280
但我真觉得今天下午的天气
but I do think it's gonna be...

273
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,540
会非常晴朗
a beautiful afternoon.

274
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,340
你猜怎么着
Guess what?

275
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,450
现在就我们俩
We're all alone.

276
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,230
是吗
Yeah?

277
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,430
是  杰克叔叔带大家去象峰了
Yeah. Uncle Jack took everybody down to Elephant Butte,

278
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,830
因为他买了艘新游艇
on account of he got this new Chaparral.

279
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,490
挺厉害的
It's pretty bad-ass,

280
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,690
但我跟他说
but I told him...

281
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,920
我对滑水不怎么感兴趣
I'm not really big into waterskiing,

282
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,310
而且  得有人
plus, somebody's...

283
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,020
照顾好你
gotta take care of you.

284
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,800
我劝了他很久  但
Took some convincing, but...

285
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,320
现在
now...

286
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,730
整个周末只有你和我
it's just you and me the whole weekend.

287
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,320
有件事我很需要你帮忙
And I-- I'd really like your help with something.

288
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,630
所以
So...

289
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,490
我不喜欢整这套
I-- I hate to be all like...

290
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,280
但我们得约法三章
But we gotta talk ground rules.

291
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,010
如果你动了逃跑的心思
Uh, if you tried to, you know, escape,

292
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,460
我就只好去探望那个小男孩了
I'm gonna have to visit the little boy.

293
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,060
到时候
It'll basically be...

294
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,410
就不是我能掌控的了
out of my hands at that point.

295
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,810
杰克叔叔对你做了承诺
Uncle Jack made you that promise,

296
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,680
他会遵守诺言的
and he's gonna want to stick to it.

297
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,120
所以
So...

298
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,680
别搞小动作  行吗
good behavior, right?

299
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,540
行吗
Right?

300
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,100
好
Good.

301
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,010
谢谢你  杰西
I appreciate it, Jesse.

302
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,900
得确保你不会
Gotta make sure you don't...

303
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,370
引起太多注意
draw too much attention.

304
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,530
从现在起我会让你更干净的  好吗
I'ma do a better job of keeping you clean from now on, okay?

305
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,390

318

好了
Okay, so,

319
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,520
其实没有那么重  但
it's not actually that heavy, but...

320
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,370
我试过  我自己没法搞定
try as I might, I can't ever get this thing on by myself.

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,440
你怎么抬方便  向前还是向后

324
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,970
我其实想
I thought maybe I could just

325
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,390
吊在这边的天花板上
hang it from the ceiling here...

326
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,660
然后把车开到下面  直接落在上面  但
and just drive right under and drop it in, but my...

327
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,270
房东不希望我这么干
landlord didn't really like that idea.

328
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,590
应该好了

榕属是花草还是树
So, is a ficus technically a plant or a tree?

361
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,620
这得看情况

He's just always lurking around, being nosy.

369
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,770

I mean, he was in Vietnam, which I totally respect, but still...

370

让我想到复活节彩蛋

但
but...

377
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,250
我最近想换新漆

是想让我帮你刷漆吗
You want me to help you paint?

382
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,950
也许吧
Maybe, yeah, um...

383
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,440
之后还有时间的话
If we have some time left over.

384
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,000
但首先
But, first, uh...

385
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,650

好吧  拜托
Okay, please don't,

392
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,110
你这样让我更难受了

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,530
我上中学的时候我奶奶给我的
My grammy gave 'em to me when I was in middle school,

421
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,490
这年头都没人会看书了
but I figured nobody needs books anymore,

422
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,250
因为电脑上什么都有
'cause everything's on the computer.

423
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,330
感觉是个藏钱的好地方
Uh, it seemed like a good hiding place.

424
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,020
而且我还有那么多册可以放
Plus, I had all these other volumes left to fill.

425
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,330
所以清洁阿姨想偷你的钱
So your cleaning lady was stealing your money?

426
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,630
什么  不是
What? No.

427
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,430
她老实得很
She was as honest as the day is long.

428
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,920
跟乔治・华盛顿小时候一样诚实
Like, George Washington honest.

429
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,490
但她发现了
But she found it,

430
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,010
我容不得有人发现这些钱
and I can't have anybody finding it.

431
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,230
她就把书拿到这里给我看
She brought it straight in here to show me.

432
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,680
她还以为我不知道里头有钱
She actually thought I didn't know it was there.

433
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,950
我还在想她是不是要查什么东西
I just-- I wonder what the heck she was looking up?

434
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,900
她几乎不会说英语
She barely spoke any English.

435
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,430
可能以为M是墨西哥吧  我也不知道
M for Mexico maybe? I don't know.

436
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,370
挺奇怪的
It's weird.

437
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,390
我们要把她带去哪里
Where are we gonna... take her?

438
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,480
去一个很美的地方
Someplace pretty.

439
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,700
这是她应得的
She deserves that.

440
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,170
能帮个忙把书收好吗
Hey, do me a favor and put that away, would ya?

441
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,120
沿着走廊一直走到里头去
Just straight down the hall all the way in the back,

442
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,760
那里有一书架的书
there's a whole shelf of 'em.

443
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,150
谢了
Thanks.

444
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,560
你真的不喝汤吗
Sure you don't want any soup?

445
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,700
你觉得我卧室怎么样
How you like my bedroom?

446
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,050
挺牛逼的吧
Pretty bitchin', huh?

447
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,380
记得按字母顺序放好
Be sure to alphabetize them.

448

{\an8}《世界百科全书》

449
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,350
我得换个地方藏钱了
I guess I better come up with a new hiding place for my money.

450
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,310
有个地方叫银行
They got these things called banks.

451
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,970
其实呢
Actually,

452
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,050
我想到了一个绝佳地点
I think I know the perfect spot.

453
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
可能得稍微改造一下  不过...
It might take a little engineering, but...

454
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,120
绝对是远在天边近在眼前  没有人能找到
Man, it would be right here and nobody would ever find it.

455
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,880
"现金必须抓在手"  这是杰克叔叔说的
"Nothing beats cash on hand," That's what Uncle Jack says.

456
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,120
-他就是个普通孩子  -是啊
- ...an average kid. - Yeah.

457
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,140
他很喜欢画画  画得很好
I mean, he liked to draw. He was good at that.

458
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,930
你们上次见到他是什么时候
When was the last time you saw him?

一年前吧  可能更久
A year. Maybe more. I mean...

461
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,880
总之是在这些事发生之前了
it was way before all of this.

462
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,420
现在有什么想对你们儿子说的吗
Is there anything you wish you could say to your son right now?

463
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,430
求求你

站出来
come forward.

535
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,120
不过我一直不信任他
never really trusted him.

536
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,130
老实说  我有预感他会出这种事
To be honest, I kinda saw this thing coming.

537
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,600
不是确信  但有预感
I mean, well, not exactly, but kinda.

还能找到什么啊
What's left to find?

551
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,630
少说话  认真搜
Shut up and look.

552
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,170
你好啊  小家伙
Hey, little guy.

553
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,770
他还养了只狼蛛
Dude's got a tarantula.

554
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,450
行吧  这房子没问题
Yeah, no crazy in this house.

555
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,350
完全正常
Perfectly normal.

556
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,220
我不杀警察
I'm no cop killer.

557
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,460
你冷静
You be cool...

558
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,100
我就冷静
and I will be cool.

559
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,720
明白吗
Understand?

560
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,030
把你搭档叫来

563
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,060
警督
Hey, Lieutenant.

564
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,120
警督  听到我说话了吗
Lieutenant, you hear me?

565
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:57,570

你有什么发现了吗
You find something?

568
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:17,550
差不多
Yeah, pretty much.

569
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,010
警督
Lieutenant?

570
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,310
后头是有什么东西吗  凯西
What's waiting for me back there, Casey?

571
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,550
-把枪放下  -别激动  放轻松
- Put your gun down! - Okay, relax, relax.

572
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,350
把枪放下  双手面向我
Put your gun down and show me your hands!

573
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:07,790
我们都别激动
Everybody relax.

574
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,820
他说他不想杀警察
He says he's not looking to kill any cops.

575
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,450
我们就...
So let's just...

576
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,850
我们一起来解决这件事  好吗
let's figure this out, all right?

577
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,980
我们能处理好的
Let's-- We're gonna figure this out.

578
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,470
你来这里干什么  平克曼
What are you doing here, Pinkman?

579
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,580
我要来找样东西
There's something I need.

580
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,730
我拿到了就走
As soon as I get it, I am gone.

581
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,430
你让我走  我发誓不会动他一根汗毛
You let me outta here, I swear I will not hurt this guy.

582
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,050
你要什么
What's this thing you need?

583
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,920
说真的  把枪扔过来  双手面向我
Seriously, throw your gun in here and show me your hands.

584
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,530
我也说真的  我不  你不放我也不放
Seriously, no. You point yours at me, I point mine at you.

585
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:35,730
就这么着
That's how this works.

586
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,410
你是要什么东西
What's this thing you need?

587
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,760
听着  我不想对任何警察开枪
Look... I don't wanna shoot any cops.

588
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,750
是吗  你不想对警察开枪  真是好极了
Yeah, you don't wanna shoot any cops. Great, fantastic.

589
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,040
你知道楼下有多少警官在待命吗
You know how many officers we got downstairs?

590
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,550
告诉他  凯西  告诉他有多少个
Tell him, Casey, tell him how many.

591
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,510
我记得有六个
A good six, last I counted.

592
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,110
六个才怪  我记得下面有八个
Six my ass, I counted eight of 'em down there.

593
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,460
四角都有巡逻车  街上就更多了
Patrol car on all four corners, more up the street.

594
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,400
如果听到了枪击声  你觉得他们会怎么做
They hear shooting, what do you think they're gonna do?

595
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,310
他们会上来  他们绝对会上来
Oh, they're coming up. They're coming up, guaranteed.

596
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:06,500
没错  他们会上来
That's right, they're coming up.

597
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,790
你觉得到时候你能跑多远
Then how far do you think you're gonna get?

598
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,000
你只有一个选择  伙计
There's only one choice here, buddy.

599
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:13,830
你知道你该怎么做
And you know what it is.

600
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,190
松手吧
Come on.

601
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,920
没人想伤害你
Nobody wants to hurt you.

602
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,130
放弃抵抗吧  平克曼
Give up, Pinkman.

603
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,300
这是你唯一的机会
It's your only chance.

604
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,550
趴在地上  把枪放下
On the ground. Guns down.

605
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,270
贴着地
On your stomach.

606
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,910
天哪  你开什么玩笑
Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?

607
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,640
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

608
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,680
-现在怎么办  -盯着他
- What now? - Stay on him.

609
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,480
好吧
All right.

610
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,730
你要干什么
Hey! What are you doing?

611
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,420
闭嘴
Shut up.

612
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,360
能不能用手铐
Hey, how about some handcuffs, yo.

613
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,760
你要干什么
What are you doing?

614
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,220
你们不是警察
You two aren't cops.

615
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,540
你们
You--

616
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,490
闭嘴
Shut the fuck up.

617
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,880
他的腿  抓住他的腿
His legs! Get his legs.

618
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,110
找点东西把他嘴塞上
Find me something to gag him with.

619
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,130
不
No!

620
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,190
我知道钱在哪
I know where the money is.

621
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,680
你们来这就是为了钱  对吗
That's what you're here for, right?

622
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,260
你们去军队用品店买了几件外套
You picked up a couple of windbreakers at the Army & Navy store,

623
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,570
闯了进来  装得像模像样的
came strolling in, all clever and shit.

624
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,150
我知道钱在哪
Well, I know where it is.

625
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,790
我他妈保证你们自己肯定找不到
And I guaran-fucking-tee you won't find it on your own.

626
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:21,240
警探们  我是卢易斯・尚泽尔  11号楼的
Detectives? Louis Schanzer, unit 11.

627
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,560
我找到了一些东西  可能对你们有用
I got somethin' that might be helpful.

628
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:25,820
有人吗
Hello?

629
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,840
警探们  一切都还好吧
Detectives? Everything okay?

630
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,220
不好意思  先生
Sorry about that, sir. We're...

631
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,850
我们在收集指纹  这是个精细活
dusting for fingerprints, you know? It's a delicate process.

632
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,720
这种活不是鉴证科干的吗
I thought your CSI boys do that.

633
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,570
他们昨天没有收集完成吗
Didn't they get 'em all yesterday?

634
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,720
是啊  不过有时得确保万无一失
Yeah, well, you know, sometimes, you want something done right--

635
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,400
可不是吗
Oh, God, tell me about it.

636
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,090
我的工作是提供餐饮和酒店用品
My line was restaurant and hospitality supplies,

637
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,750
我完全理解
so I completely get it.

638
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:55,960
你看
Hey, listen,

639
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,320
我刚找到托德・阿尔奎斯特留给我的旧纸条
I just came across an old note Todd Alquist wrote me.

640
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,600
-我感觉可能会有用  -是吗
- Figured it may be of interest. - Oh, really?

641
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,470
没错
Yeah.

642
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:05,810
一封没啥诚意的道歉信  从我门缝里塞进来的
Sort of a half-assed apology he slipped under my door.

643
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,140
我去找房东投诉他的那个卡车盖
I'd gone to our landlord about this stupid truck cap of his

644
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,240
大家总是会被它绊倒  然后...
everybody kept tripping over, and--

645
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,760
反正如果你需要分析笔迹
Well, anyway, if you need a handwriting sample for analysis.

646
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,210
没错  这会很有帮助的
That's-- Yeah, yeah, that could be...

647
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,140
-好的  -放在里面了
- Yeah, sure. - Left it inside.

648
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,720
没想去碰它  指纹嘛
Didn't want to touch it, speaking of fingerprints.

649
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,670
你随时都能来检查
You're welcome to come examine it.

650
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:29,730
没关系的  我有时间
Oh, it's no trouble. I got time.

651
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,460
告诉我钱在哪  我就放你走
Show me the money, I let you go.

652
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,950
磨叽啥呢
What do you say, huh?

653
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,910
我觉得挺公平的
Seems pretty fair to me.

654
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:19,450
该死
Oh, shit!

655
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,350
-我的天哪  -你声音轻点
- Holy shit! - Keep your voice down.

656
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,580
天哪  这得有
God, there's gotta be...

657
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:27,910
这得有一百万了吧  肯定没错
there's gotta be a million here. Yeah.

658
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:37,860
你干什么
What are you doing?

659
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:42,550
-拿走我的那一半  -等等
- Taking my half. - Wow.

660
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:44,390
是吗
Yeah?

661
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,730
小人物也有大梦想  是吗
A little man with big dreams? Yeah?

662
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,670
如果我是你
Hey, if I were you,

663
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,120
我现在就会立刻离开这
I'd walk the hell outta here right now.

664
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,670
我会朝你开枪的  你这混蛋
I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch.

665
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,020
我会朝你开枪
I will shoot you.

666
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,760
那你开枪啊
Then do it already.

667
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,680
如果我没拿到这笔钱
If I don't get this money,

668
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,690
那我也死定了
I am dead anyway.

669
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,720
如果你扣下扳机
All right? If you pull that trigger,

670
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,960
那你还得杀掉外面那个大嘴巴
then you are gonna have to kill that loudmouth down the hall

671
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,590
以及这里所有的目击证人
and every other witness in the place.

672
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:25,210
然后你就会和我一样走投无路了
Then you will be as fucked as I am.

673
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,300
那么
So...

674
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,340
你想怎么样呢
what's it gonna be?

675
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,450
分成三份  你拿走你的那份
Three-way split. And you got your third.

676
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,120
别得寸进尺
Don't push it.

677
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,630
-喂  -别说话  听好
- Yep? - Don't react, just listen.

678
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,440
我拿到钱了
I got the money.

679
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:25,800
你得和他再聊五分钟
You gotta keep him talking for the next five minutes.

680
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,320
自从买了滤水器
Since I got the Brita,

681
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,530
我发现茶的味道明显好多了
I find the tea tastes noticeably better.

682
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:32,400
没问题
Not a problem.

683
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,060
你有种  我承认
You got balls, I'll give you that.

684
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,110
能把枪还给我吗
Can I get my gun back?

685
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,580
去你妈的  自己买
Fuck you. Go buy one.

686
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:56,060
{\an8}坎迪焊接公司

687
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,980
我还在想你什么时候会想起我
I was wondering when you were gonna remember me.

688
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,850
{\an8}质量最好的吸尘器

690
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,340
我觉得颜色很鲜艳
It's colorful, I'll say that much.

691
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,190
没错
Yes, it is.

692
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,390
放在壁橱里一定很显眼
I don't expect you'd ever lose it in your closet.

693
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,730
不能更换吸尘包吗
And no dirt bag to replace?

694
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:15,880
没错
That's correct.

695
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,300
很多顾客都觉得很方便实用
A lot of our customers find that handy and practical.

696
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,270
他们愿意花一大笔钱来买
But they want an arm and a leg to pay for it.

697
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:24,220
我可不愿意花钱买这花里胡哨的
And I ain't paying for no paint job.

698
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:26,680
我同意  这的确很贵
Yes, I agree. It's very expensive.

699
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,130
但质量很不错
But it's a fine product.

700
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:31,440
不过  如果你还是喜欢原来的柯比吸尘器
However, if you are in love with your Kirby,

701
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,620
我应该能帮你修好它
I'll bet I could get it working for you again.

702
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,010
等我一下  马上就来
Uh, be with you in a minute.

703
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:39,910
修好我的旧吸尘器  要花多少钱
Fixing my Kirby, how much would that cost?

704
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:44,030
在没看到吸尘器之前  我还无法确定
Well, I won't know until I take a good look at it, and it...

705
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:47,590
如果需要更换新的马达  就会贵一点
and if it needed a new motor, it'd be a little bit expensive,

706
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,970
但肯定没新的戴森吸尘器贵
but certainly not as expensive as a new Dyson.

707
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,750
检测是免费的
The estimate's free, and...

708
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,600
你只需要把它带过来
all you gotta do is bring it in here.

709
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,940
-听你的吧  -很好
- I may take you up on that. - Excellent.

710
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,770
如果能找我的侄女帮我
If I can get my niece to help me.

711
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:01,120
现在的吸尘器都好重
They make 'em so heavy.

712
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,070
是的  没错
Yes, they do,

713
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,170
我希望你保证
and I want you to promise

714
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,970
别自己一个人把它搬来
you won't try to bring it in by yourself.

715
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,040
去找人帮忙
Get that help.

716
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:11,530
我就是不明白为什么现在东西都不经用了
I just don't know why they can't make things to last anymore.

717
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,350
说到我心坎里了
You're singing my song.

718
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,660
祝你一天愉快
I want you to have a great day now.

719
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:19,270
谢谢你的帮助  我会带旧吸尘器来的
Thank you, thanks for your help. I'll be back with my Kirby.

720
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,420
很好  开车要小心
Excellent. Drive carefully.

721
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,570
如果有问题想问  和我说一声
If there's any questions I can answer, just let me know.

722
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:41,710
{\an8}营业中

723
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,560
{\an8}打烊

724
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,220
希望你不要这么做
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that.

725
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,490
我要开门做生意的
I'm open for business.

726
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,930
我想要
I'm looking for a...

727
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,850
胡佛真空吸尘器
Hoover Max.

728
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,710
压强最大  最大压强
Pressure Max, Max Pressure.

729
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,560
胡佛  也许是专业版的
Hoover, or maybe it's a Pro Max.

730
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,450
有个像滤尘器一样的东西
Got like a-- like a filter.

731
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,590
胡佛牌就在你身后的墙上
Hoover products are right over there on the wall behind you.

732
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:11,130
我已经记不起具体的暗号了
Look, I don't remember the exact, like, password.

733
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:13,210
好吗  反正就是一吸尘器
All right? But it was a vacuum thing.

734
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,460
好吧
Okay, fine.

735
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,480
给你
Here you go.

736
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:25,460

01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,320
十万  十一万

742
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,020
十二万  十二万五
twenty-four, twenty-five.

743
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,210
给你
There you go.

744
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,100
十二万五千
$125,000.

745
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:49,370
拜托  你知道我为什么来这的
Come on, man, you know why I'm here.

746
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,720
我还真不知道
I can't say I do, no.

747
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,930
你知道  你就是那个人
Yeah, you do. You're the guy.

748
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,970
你知道的
Yeah, you do.

749
01:10:58,450 --> 01:10:59,490
你就是那个人
You're the guy.

750
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,660
我有百分之九十六的肯定  你就是那个人
Look, I am 96 percent sure that you are the guy,

751
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,430
你干脆承认算了
so why don't you just, like, admit it?

752
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,800
你看  我身上没有监听器
Look, all right, no wire.

753
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,810
可以了吗  没有监听器
Okay? No wire.

754
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:15,080
也没有武器
And no gun.

755
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,200
好吗  没人知道我在这
Okay? And nobody knows I'm here.

756
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,560
我只是需要
I just need...

757
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,770
需要你的服务
just need your services.

758
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:24,550
接头的那天  你开了一辆小货车
The day at the pickup spot, you pulled up in a minivan,

759
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,510
红色的丰田小货车
a red Toyota minivan.

760
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:27,850
颜色就像芸豆
Looks like a kidney bean.

761
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,730
和外面停着的那辆车一模一样
Same exact minivan you got parked out back.

762
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,320
好吗  我看见了
All right? I saw it.

763
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:35,990
好
All right.

764
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,850
你有原则  好吧
You got rules. All right.

765
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:43,200
我理解  我郑重道歉
I get that, and I apologize, seriously.

766
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,390
那天我没跟你走  我很抱歉
I didn't go with you that day, and I am sorry.

767
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:50,630
你都不知道我有多后悔
Look, you will never know how sorry,

768
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,050
但我现在来了
but I am here now.

769
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,340
好吗  我有钱
All right? And I have cash.

770
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,380
拜托你
So, please?

771
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,050
好吗
Okay?

772
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,210
拜托了
Please?

773
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:11,600
-第一次接头的钱你还欠着我  -太好了
- You owe me for that first pickup. - Yes!

774
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:12,690
你就是那个人
You're the gu--

775
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,510
-等等  什么  -这笔钱
- Wait, what? - This...

776
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:19,810
是你之前欠的
is previously-owed.

777
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,210
如果你希望
Going forward,

778
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,720
继续接受服务
were we to,

779
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:30,860
还要再加十二万五千
would require an additional 125.

780
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,060
好吧
All right.

781
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,220
这很公平
Fair is fair.

782
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:40,910
做生意得守规矩
A deal's a deal.

783
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:43,420
你看
All right. Look...

784
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,090
两万
Four...

785
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:49,780
四万
eight...

786
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,210
五万
ten,

787
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,540
七万  九万
fourteen, eighteen...

788
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:56,820
十万
twenty...

789
01:12:59,100 --> 01:12:59,980
十万
twenty--

790
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,460
十一万
Twenty-two.

791
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,710
十一万
Twenty-two.

792
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:13,790
没错
Yeah.

793
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,500
十一万五千
Twenty-three.

794
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:21,520
如果我没算错  你还差一万
By my arithmetic, you're $10,000 shy.

795
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,340
八千二
Eighty-two hundred.

796
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,980
八千二
Eighty-two hundred.

797
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,060
我能借用一下吗
May I borrow this?

798
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,120
你想干什么
What are you doing?

799
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,150
我在帮你收好私人物品
I'm gathering your belongings.

800
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,800
不  不  不  停下
No, no no. No, no. Stop.

801
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:18,130
我不会收回你欠我的
I'm not gonna try to collect what you owe me.

802
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,500
那样对我们两个谁都不好
I don't think it would end well for either one of us.

803
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,010
这不是什么无关痛痒的钱
This is not an inconsequential amount of money.

804
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,110
听我说
Hey, listen to me.

805
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,820
省着点花  够你用好几年的
Spend it wisely, it will last you for years.

806
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,360
拜托  你没明白
Please, you don't understand.

807
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:32,680
行事低调  夜晚出行
Keep a low profile, travel by night.

808
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,780
天啊
Oh, God.

809
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,640
走运的话
With a little luck,

810
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:40,190
你很快就能远离这里
you will soon find yourself many miles from here.

811
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,330
祝你一路顺风
Godspeed to you.

812
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,260
就这样了
So that's it?

813
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:48,210
就这样
That's it.

814
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:50,670
现在  请你离开
Now, please leave.

815
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,740
就差1800块钱
You are going to jack me up

816
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,000
你都不肯帮帮忙
over a measly $1,800?

817
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,580
我要重新营业了
I've got to reopen.

818
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,160
你在这待的时间越长
The longer you stick around here,

819
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:05,310
你就把自己困得越深
the more you jeopardize yourself.

820
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,660
不
No, hey...

821
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,810
不
No. Hey...

822
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,210
你看新闻了吗
Have you been watching the news?

823
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,900
看了  那还用说
I have. Very much so.

824
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,380
他们怎么说我的你也听到了
So you hear what they've been saying about me.

825
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,360
-对吧  -对
-Yeah? -Yeah.

826
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:23,790
这些人
Look, these people,

827
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,660
他们把我关在水泥洞里
they have kept me in a concrete hole.

828
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,180
我都不知道现在是几月
Look, I don't even know what month it is.

829
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:34,750
他们开枪杀人的时候  逼着我当观众
They made me watch when they... when they shot someone--

830
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,910
如果你认为你能博得人们的同情
If you believe that you can pull on people's heartstrings,

831
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,270
你应该去警察那里碰碰运气
you should take your chances with the police.

832
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:43,630
在我看来  你是自作自受
From where I sit, you made your own luck.

833
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,130
你的老搭档也是
As did your former partner.

834
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,940
你的律师也是
As did your lawyer.

835
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:52,070
你自己说的  做生意得守规矩
You said it yourself, a deal's a deal.

836
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:54,640
不
No.

837
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,620
我哪都不去
I am not going anywhere.

838
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:04,010
我就在这待着
I am staying right here

839
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:06,220
直到你帮我
until you help me.

840
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,110
你要干什么
What are you doing?

841
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,400
你好
Hi, yes.

842
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:26,220
我的店里来了个年轻人
There's a young man in my store,

843
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:28,090
他不肯走
and he refuses to leave.

844
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,590
别打了
Hey, stop.

845
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:30,530

846
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,800
-是的  他可能有武器  -别打了
- Yeah, he might be armed. - Stop it.

847
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,060
不明显
Uh, not overtly.

848
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,520
不过  是的  我开始感到威胁了
But, yes, I'm beginning to feel threatened.

849
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,380
-你来真的  -当然
- Are you serious? -Sure.

850
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,470
我叫埃德・加尔布雷斯
My name is Ed Galbraith.

851
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,220
我是高档吸尘器的店主
I own Best Quality Vacuum,

852
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:48,590
第四大街2714号
2714, 4th Street.

853
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,610
西北  对的
Northwest. That's correct.

854
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,430
如果能立刻派人过来
I would appreciate it very much

855
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:55,240
那就太好了
if you'd send someone immediately.

856
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,760
装模做样
You are so full of crap.

857
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:18,160
你刚才根本没打电话
You didn't call anybody just now.

858
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:19,640
你是装的
You faked it.

859
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,410
你想知道我是怎么知道的吗
And you wanna know how I know?

860
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,730
你和我一样怕出事
You got as much to lose as I do.

861
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,190
而且更怕  怕得多
More. Way more.

862
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,710
当你所谓的警察来这抓捕我的时候
When your "Cops" get here and they bust me,

863
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,440
他们第一个要问的就是我为什么来这
first question they're gonna ask is what am I doing here,

864
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,910
把一大包现金
trying to hand over a Hefty bag full of cash

865
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:40,340
给一个开吸尘器商店的人
to a dude who runs a vacuum cleaner store.

866
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:41,950
结果会怎样
What comes out then? Huh?

867
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:47,210
你知道还有什么特别扯吗
Oh, and you, uh, wanna know what else is bullshit?

868
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,260
这样  给你个忠告
You know, like, word to the wise:

869
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,700
下次想对什么人用这一招的话
next time to try to pull this shit on someone,

870
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:56,580
别挂断报警电话
you don't just hang up on a 9-1-1 call.

871
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,310
他们不会让你挂断的
They won't let you.

872
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,330
因为那个男接线员或女接线员
Because the lady, or dude, or whoever is like,

873
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,060
"请保持通话  先生
"Stay on the line with me, sir.

874
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:06,610
在警官到达现场之前请保持通话"
Stay on the line until the officers arrive."

875
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:10,640
如果你真的挂断了  他们会立刻打过来
And if you did hang up, they'd call you back immediately.

876
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,710
但是没打
But, hey, guess what?

877
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,920
说实话  你真可悲
Seriously, yo. Pathetic.

878
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,730
这个响应时间真是太棒了
Wow, you gotta love that response time.

879
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,840
拿上你的钱
Take your money.

880
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:41,980
警官  谢谢你们这么快就赶过来了

- He obviously heard my call and-- - Is he still here?

882

不  他已经走了  我
No, he's not, he's gone. I, uh...

885
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,580
步行往北边去了

886
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,540
-你能描述一下他吗  -当然
- Can you describe him? - Uh, sure I can.

892
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:10,480
很有意思  一个大昆虫

Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?

894
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,740
做生意得守规矩  说话算话
A deal's a deal? Your word is your bond?

895
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,120

对你来说更安全  好处更多

搞定了
Done.

981
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,080
你搞定个鬼
Bullshit you're done.

982
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,910
你弄了二十分钟  都干什么了
You've been here 20 minutes, what'd you do?

983
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,460
在这加了一块鱼尾板
Added a fishplate up here,

984
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:45,170
中间一个  那边堵头还有一个
one in the middle, one down at the end.

985
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:46,140
加了个什么
Added a what?

986
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:47,530
鱼尾板
A fishplate.

987
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:49,900
什么  一盘鱼吗
What, like a... plate of fish?

988
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:52,080
搞毛线  真有那个词吗
What the fuck is that? Is that even a real word?

989
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,870
哥们  我想要多来点这种东西
Look, man, I want more of those things,

990
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,100
斜着的对角的那种  再来两倍这么多
the sideway diagonal things, like twice as many.

991
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,690
那叫角板
Those are gussets.

992
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:01,420
你已经有很多了
You got enough of 'em already.

993
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,350
好吧  角板我不需要了
Okay, yeah. So, gussets I got out the ass,

994
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,120
但是我需要鱼尾板  为啥
but a fishplate I need 'cause... What?

995
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,550
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}天主教传统  周五吃鱼

996
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,550
我信天主教  今天星期五是吗
I'm Catholic and it's Friday?

997
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:13,030
你真的不能多装几个角板上去吗  尼尔
You sure you couldn't just put a few more gussets up there, Neil?

998
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,700
没什么坏处  对吧
I mean, what could it hurt, right?

999
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,240
你的钱  你说了算
Hey, it's your money.

1000
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,300
但是我刚才说了  根本没必要
But what I just did, you don't even need that.

1001
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,230
这东西已经够结实了
I told you I built this thing right.

1002
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,580
哥们  我不是想
Look, bro, I'm not like

1003
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:24,680
质疑你出众的焊接技术
impugning on your precious welding skills.

1004
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,940
只是因为我们这里情况有点特殊
It's just we have a, uh, unique situation here.

1005
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,530
他已经跑过一次了
Tried to rabbit on us once already.

1006
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:44,450
我怕他还会想办法把这玩意打开
I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way to break this thing.

1007
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:46,000
你开玩笑吗
You kidding me?

1008
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:47,660
就他
Him?

1009
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:48,710
对  就是感觉
Yeah, it's just I kinda feel

1010
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:51,260
这东西太松了点  这里  看
it flexing a little bit. A bit right here, look.

1011
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:56,780
对  看到了吗  就是这里  有点
Yeah, see? Right there. Yeah, a little bit.

1012
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,680
对  我根本没看到哪里松了
Yeah, I don't see jack shit flexing.

1013
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,450
那上面是十公分粗的槽铁
That's four-inch channel iron up there.

1014
01:31:01,450 --> 01:31:03,100
你可以在上面挂辆福特车
You could hang an F150 from it

1015
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,770
然后把它当沙滩球一样前后打
and shove it back and forth like a beach ball.

1016
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:06,890
它都纹丝不动
It's going nowhere.

1017
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:09,150
好吧  你和你那十公分粗的槽铁
Okay, you and your big four inches.

1018
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:10,980
对于这个小混蛋来说就像细丝一样
It's just this little bastard's wiry.

1019
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:14,320
管它什么细丝  就让他折腾去吧
I don't care how wiry he is. Have him knock himself out.

1020
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,520
是吗
Oh, yeah?

1021
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,700
想打赌吗
Wanna put your money where your mouth is?

1022
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,050
我出五十块赌他可以当场逃脱
Fifty bucks says he breaks this thing right here, right now.

1023
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:26,460
五十块  还有
Fifty, plus,

1024
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:29,050
你得再多装几个...
then you gotta put up more of those...

1025
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:30,770
叫什么来着  角板
What'd you call 'em, gussets?

1026
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:31,950
还要免费
No charge.

1027
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,410
顺便再装几个鱼尾板
Throw in some fishplates too, while you're at it.

1028
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:36,890
赌就赌
You're on.

1029
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:37,950
没问题  是吗
I'm on, huh?

1030
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,540
好  把那个破玩意拿走  好好看着
All right, all right. Get that shit out the way and watch this.

1031
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,670
好  帅哥
All right, good-lookin'.

1032
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,480
你看到了  这个考验可不轻松
This is it. This is the acid test.

1033
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,070
加油
Go for it.

1034
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:52,080
开始  快  快  快  加油
Now! Go, go, go! Come on!

1035

Faster! Hit it hard!

1036
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,380
好了  好了  换个方向  换个方向
All right, all right. Other way, other way.

1037
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:58,790
你怎么慢下来了  使劲
Hey, what are you slowing down for? Hit it!

1038
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:00,740
你怎么慢下来了  使劲
what are you slowing down for? Hit it!

1039
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:04,030
好  加油  站起来
All right, come on, get up.

1040

I got 50 bucks riding on you. I gotta eat this month.

1041
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,210
肯尼  如果你让他把腿摔断了
Kenny, if he breaks his leg,

1042
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:10,590
他就没法制毒了
he's not gonna be able to cook.

1043
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:13,100
你是人力资源部的吗
What, are you the fucking HR department?

1044
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,890
天哪  托德  放松点
Jesus, Toddie, relax.

1045
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,560
给你点优势吧
We're gonna even up the odds a little bit.

1046
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:19,330
好了
All right.

1047
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:20,750
行了
Okay.

1048
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,290
我相信你
Now, I believe in you.

1049

好
Yeah!

1057
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:47,630
托德  这家伙到底是谁
Todd, who is this guy anyway?

1058
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:49,070
他是干什么的
What'd he do?

1059
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,750
这个...  说来话长
It's-- It's kind of a long story.

1060
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,140
对
Yeah.

1061
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,660
他是内奸
He's a rat.

1062
01:32:58,610 --> 01:32:59,990
你知道这个就行了
That's all you need to know.

1063
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,050
好  伙计们
Okay, guys.

1064

-我们跳舞还是干嘛  -钱只付到三点
- We dancing or what? - You paid till three

Would you stop? You're crazy.

1073
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,550
该死的白皮猪

- We'll see you next week. - In your dreams, buddy.

1075
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:14,860
只想回家  上床睡觉
Just wanna go home, get in my bed,

1076
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,030
抱着我的狗
cuddle with my dog.

1077
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,970
我累死了
I am exhausted.

1078
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:21,340
我再也不想来这个垃圾场了
I'm never coming back to this dump place again.

1079
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,090
我的脚痛死了
My feet hurt.

1080
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,200
醒醒  克莱伦斯  我们走
Wake up, Clarence, let's go.

1081
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:30,620
看这双该死的鞋子  弄得这么脏
Look at my fucking shoes. I know. This is a mess.

1082
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:32,060
根本不值这个钱
It wasn't even worth it.

1083
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:35,440
我得花几小时才能把泥巴弄干净
It's gonna take me hours to get the mud out.

1084
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:37,670
等等我
Wait for me!

1085
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:09,910
我说  "孩子
I said, "My son,

1086
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,850
杨百翰出生的时候  可卡因还没发明呢
cocaine wasn't even invented when Brigham Young was born.

1087
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,630
没事的  你可以来点"
It's okay, you can have some."

1088
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:17,880
来  到爸爸这来  就是这样
Come on, come to papa. There we go.

1089
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,940
-你再也拿不回去了  -瞧瞧他
- You'll never get that back. - There he goes.

1090
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:23,340
-黑钻石  -再见  可卡因
- Black diamond. - Bye-bye, cocaine.

1091
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:25,350
他成了浑身可卡因的摩门教徒
He's all cocaine and Mormons.

1092
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,840
怎么了
What's up?

1093
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,320
我要更多的钱
I need more money.

1094
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:07,440
是吗
Oh, yeah?

1095
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,740
三等分不够我花
That three-way split didn't quite cover it for me.

1096
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:14,940
如果你们能帮我一把  我会很感激
I'd appreciate you helping me out.

1097
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:17,810
他在说什么  三等分
Well, what's he talking about? Three-way split?

1098
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:20,030
你是说还有三分之一
You mean there was a third more?

1099
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:21,500
给了他
And you gave it to him?

1100
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:24,280
说来话长
It's a long story.

1101
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:25,950
那...
Well...

1102
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,280
有多长
What long story?

1103
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,940
我走的时候  他连把该死的枪都没有
When I left, he didn't even have a fucking gun.

1104
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,890
他现在有枪了  不是吗
Well, he's got one now, doesn't he?

1105
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:34,670
闭嘴吧  这件事交给我
So, you know, shut up. Let me handle this.

1106
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:36,470
尼尔  这家伙到底是谁
Neil, who the hell is this guy?

1107
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,930
对  你居然让他这样大摇大摆走进来
Yeah, I can't believe you just let him walk in here with--

1108
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:41,160
我说"闭嘴"是让所有人闭嘴
"Shut up" Means everybody.

1109
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:46,470
话说
Now,

1110
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,950
你打算怎么拿到钱
how exactly do you plan on pulling this off?

1111
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,560
毕竟我们有五个人  而你孤身一人
I mean, being that there's five of us and one of you.

1112
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,560
我不是来抢钱的
I'm not here to rob you.

1113
01:36:57,850 --> 01:36:59,050
不是吗
Oh, you're not?

1114
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,860
那你准备怎么办
Then how's this work?

1115
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:06,200
我只要一千八
All I need is $1,800.

1116
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,360
求你们
I'm asking as a...

1117
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,070
帮个忙
a favor.

1118
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:11,630
什么  做慈善吗
Oh, what, like charity?

1119
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:15,480
这个白痴狗崽子不是给你一大笔了吗
Seems to me this silly son of a bitch already forked over, big time.

1120
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,480
凯西  说真的  闭嘴吧
Casey, seriously, shut up.

1121
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:19,950
一千八  对吗
$1,800, huh?

1122
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:23,310
为什么不干脆要两千
Why not an even two grand?

1123
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,020
凑个整数
You know, nice round number.

1124
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,790
一千八就够了
$1,800 is all I need.

1125
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:30,220
那带枪来干什么  自卫吗
So, what's the gun for? It's like personal protection?

1126
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,550
那是...
I mean, is that a...

1127
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,660
那是什么  给我看看那东西
What is that? Let me see that thing. Show me.

1128
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:43,000
我的天  是那把点二二吗
Oh, my God, is that a .22?

1129
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,410
你带了把点二二来
You brought a .22?

1130
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,170
天哪
Jesus!

1131
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:49,030
你从哪里弄到的
Where'd you get that thing?

1132
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,880
应该是我爷爷的
I think it was my grandfather's.

1133
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,580
好吧  还挺可爱的
Oh, well, it's adorable.

1134
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:54,780
我们这儿到处是空啤酒罐
I know we got empty beer cans around here

1135
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,560
你想打着玩玩吗
if you wanna do some plinking?

1136
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,740
给我一千八
Eighteen hundred.

1137
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,630
我就永远消失
I'm gone forever.

1138
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:05,650
就这么简单
Simple as that.

1139
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:06,980
尼尔  我发誓
Neil, I swear to God,

1140
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:09,820
如果你再多给这个混蛋一个子...
if you give this piece of shit one more dollar--

1141
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,000
外面很冷
Cold out here.

1142
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:42,060
告诉你吧
Tell you what.

1143
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,160
我的三分之一放在一个行李袋里
My third is in a duffel bag

1144
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,280
在那个文件柜最上面的抽屉里
in the top drawer of that file cabinet.

1145
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,750
你的在哪
Where's yours?

1146
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:55,660
在我车里
In my car.

1147
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:57,810
停在街上
Parked up the street.

1148
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,130
你觉得
What do you say...

1149
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:03,340
用你的点二二
your .22...

1150
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:05,560
跟我的点四五对决如何
against my .45?

1151
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:08,620
赢了全部拿走
Winner takes all.

1152
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:11,560
-就像《狂野西部》里那样吗  -对

1154
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:16,390
什么  不是吧
What? Come on.

1155
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,610
天哪  尼尔
Jesus! Neil?

1156
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:27,200
-拜托  哥们  我不是这个意思  -凯西
- Come on, man, I didn't mean this-- - Casey.

1157
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,600
你他妈闭嘴
Shut the fuck up.

1158
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:33,600
我不要再...
I'm not gonna get in another--

1159

不  等等  你们...
No, wait, you go-- Oh!

1163
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,450
别开枪
Hey, don't shoot.

1164
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:56,970
好  过去
All right. Get over here.

如果你们向警察告发我
You tell the cops about me,

1177
01:41:31,890 --> 01:41:35,600
我会让你们所有人都没有好下场

我不知道
I don't know.

1186
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:00,310
你想怎么说服我
How you-- How are you gonna convince me?

1187
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:44,640
{\an8}猫头鹰咖啡馆

1193
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,450
你肯定可以
Sure you can.

1194
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,820
感觉我是跟辛纳屈[著名歌手]一起来的
It's like I'm here with Sinatra.

1195
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:39,530

那个菠萝肯定很好吃

不喜欢也不讨厌
I can take it or leave it.

1200
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,030
菠萝对身体好  有溴化物
Pineapple's good for you. It's got bromide.

1201
01:45:54,030 --> 01:45:55,300

其实完全是不一样的物质
Actually, it's not close at all.

1204
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,290
你不吃吗  你应该吃点的
Are you gonna eat? You should really eat something.

1205
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:03,960
吃  马上就吃

1206

你得吃东西  喝水

1214

别急  可能还要更久
Easy. Maybe more.

1215
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:53,730
你想不到任何可以...
There's no one that you can think of who might...

1216
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:55,560
买下整批货的人吗
buy the entire amount?

1217
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:58,990
有一百三十万闲钱在手边的人吗  没有
Uh, someone with a spare $1.3 million lying around? No.

1218
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,750
不认识
Can't say that I do.

1219
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,530
你的家人一定会得到
Your family is gonna get

1220
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:10,740
他们应得的每一分钱  怀特老师

你呢  杰西
What about you, Jesse?

1224
01:47:34,010 --> 01:47:36,380
卖掉这批货后  你有什么打算
After this. What then?

1225
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:41,500
没有吗  念个大学怎么样
Nothing? What about college?

1226
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:46,730
说真的  有什么阻碍你去念大学吗
No, what is stopping you from going to college?

1227
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,600
-应该没有  -是啊  根本没有
- Nothing, I guess. - Yeah, nothing at all.

1228
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,320
假设你去念大学
Say you went to college.

1229
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:57,520
你会选什么专业
What would you study, you think, eh?

1230
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,360
你对什么感兴趣
What interests you?

01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:15,910
或者...商科怎么样

商科和市场营销

1239
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,700

- Well, yeah. - I mean, you'd be a natural.

你也能做到
You could do it too.

1244
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,670
第一步
First step,

1245
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,850
去考一张同等学历证书  对你来说没问题
get your GED, that's no problem.

1246
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:44,290
我要同等学历证书干什么

1247

Yo, you were standing right on stage when they handed it to me.

1250
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,630
我知道  我只是不小心忘了
I know, it just slipped my mind.

1251
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:59,360
我是正经的高中毕业生  混球
I totally graduated high school, dick.

1252
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,400
完全没有靠你
Which is no thanks to you,

1253
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,210
-好吗  -这不是重点
