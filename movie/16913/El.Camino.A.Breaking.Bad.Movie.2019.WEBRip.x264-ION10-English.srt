1
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,958
You know he's not gonna be happy.

2
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,416
No, I suspect he won't.

3
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,833
Only you can decide
what's best for you, Jesse.

4
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,166
Not him, not me.

5
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:02,958
I'm out.

6
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,833
So, what are you gonna do
with all that money?

7
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,250
Same thing I do with all the other money.

8
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,375
How about you, teenage retiree?

9
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,333
You'll be living the dream.

10
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,208
Not sure I should stick around town.

11
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,458
That's a start.

12
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,833
Nothing really keeping me here.

13
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,500
Where would you go?

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,583
If you were me.

15
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,125
- Doesn't matter. I'm not you.
- Seriously, come on.

16
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,666
Like, if you were my age.

17
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,666
Just play along.

18
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,208
Make some conversation.

19
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,458
Alaska.

20
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,166
Yeah?

21
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,583
Yeah, if I were your age, starting fresh,

22
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,541
Alaska.

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,000
It's the last frontier.

24
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,958
Up there, you could be anything you want.

25
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,041
Alaska.

26
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,625
Start over.

27
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,166
- Start fresh.
- One could.

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Put things right.

29
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,541
No.

30
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,958
Sorry, kid, that's the one thing
you can never do.

31
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,125
Dude, you suck.

32
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,791
This thing's, like, defective and shit.

33
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,916
Think you got Cheeto dust
in the controller.

34
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,708
It's a bad carpenter
that blames his hammer, yo.

35
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,708
Whatever.

36
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,500
You're apexing too early.
You're apexing too early.

37
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:50,250
I'm apexing at the apex, bitch.
Don't be telling me how to drive and shit.

38
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,625
You couldn't drive a two-button elevator.

39
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,583
You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.

40
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,500
Whatever that means.

41
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,041
You couldn't drive a short bus
full of slow kids to the zoo.

42
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,458
Yeah, because I'd be
too distracted by you.

43
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,541
You'd be sitting up front,
in your special helmet,

44
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,916
trying to hump my leg.

45
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,500
On account you couldn't drive
Thelma and Louise off of that cliff. Apex!

46
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,000
I can't apex more
than I'm already apexing.

47
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,166
You drive like a blind guy with no legs.

48
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,625
Dude, you...
you drive like my dead grandmoms.

49
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,083
That's disrespectful.

50
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,166
Dude, you lost?

51
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,416
Who is it?

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Jesse?

53
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,791
Who is it?

54
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,416
I gotta get that car off the street.

55
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,208
What the hell, yo?

56
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,625
Come check out what's on TV.

57
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,583
Man, what's wrong with you?
I ain't watching no TV right now.

58
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,208
It's the news.

59
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,833
Is it true that a military grade firearm

60
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,791
was altered and used
to carry out this attack?

61
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,541
To the best of my knowledge,
it was an M60 machine gun,

62
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,125
which, yes,
that's strictly a military issue weapon.

63
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,583
As to where he could have obtained
such a weapon,

64
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,541
or the so-called remote control
aspect of it,

65
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,166
anything I could say at this point
would just be conjecture.

66
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,625
And I'm not going to engage in that.
Yes?

67
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,791
Could you tell us more
about this person of interest?

68
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,833
We're hearing a lot
of conflicting information

69
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,833
and I'm unclear whether this person
took part in the killings,

70
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,500
or whether they were, in fact,

71
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,000
I guess the word
we keep hearing is liberated.

72
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,875
Were they liberated by White
from some sort of captivity?

73
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,291
I'm not prepared,
at this time, to say any more than that.

74
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,583
They're a person of interest and they may
have information relevant to this case,

75
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,708
or other cases the DEA's investigating.

76
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,791
Was, in fact, held in captivity.

77
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,708
What were the motives of his captors?

78
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,125
Can't speculate on that at this time...

79
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,083
Jesse!

80
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,125
- Who's there?
- Hey! It's cool man, it's us!

81
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,375
It's us.
It's us, Jesse, you're safe.

82
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,125
It's us.

83
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,875
My stuff's gonna fit you like a T, yo.

84
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,166
Not like if you had to borrow it
from Sasquatch over here.

85
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,166
Can't help it that I'm sized for love.

86
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,750
Yeah, you go love
all the giraffes you want, bitch.

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,208
Me and Jesse are sticking with the ladies.

88
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, this here's barely worn.

89
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,833
How's this working for you?

90
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,791
Good?

91
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,541
Jesse?

92
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,083
Right on.

93
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,833
Get you some new clothes then.

94
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,375
Shower will make you feel
a whole lot better.

95
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,875
Truth be told,
you look like you're hurting for one.

96
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,041
Church.

97
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,583
No offense.

98
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,625
Got you a clean towel,
the one on the right. Well, kinda.

99
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,708
And feel free to open up
a new bar of Irish Spring, whatever.

100
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,791
It's underneath, you know.

101
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,791
'Cause the old one might have,
like, hairs on it and shit, and...

102
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,750
yo, I got Axe body spray,

103
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,291
I got Obsession for Men,
I got Tommy Hilfinger.

104
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,250
Feel free to use any of 'em you want,
you know? Use 'em all.

105
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,541
Obsession's the bomb, yo.
I got it for him for Christmas.

106
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,041
Oh, hey...

107
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,041
Maybe don't, like,
shave and whatnot, you know?

108
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,125
Be less recognizable?

109
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,375
Jesse, did they really...

110
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,583
What?

111
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,041
Did they really keep you in a cage?

112
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,625
Yeah!

113
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,875
No!

114
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,041
- Whoa, dude. Why'd you...
- Looking sharp, yo.

115
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,375
Yeah, looking sharp.

116
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,125
Feel like a new man?

117
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,666
Yeah. Thanks.

118
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,041
Want a little something,
take the edge off?

119
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:30,916
No.

120
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,958
Why'd you turn off the TV?

121
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,791
News that bad?

122
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,083
There's just a whole lot of it.

123
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,625
Yeah.

124
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,000
I gotta get out of here.

125
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,333
Where to? You got a plan?

126
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,375
Maybe.

127
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,041
Hey, Skinny,

128
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,333
you got a burner you can give me?

129
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,750
Fully charged and clean as a whistle.

130
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,833
First, I gotta get rid of that car.

131
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,750
To the victims
and his role in their brutal slayings

132
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,333
remains unconfirmed
by federal authorities.

133
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,541
However, APD sources say the suspect
is Jesse Bruce Pinkman,

134
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,916
a local man who was a student of White's
before joining him in the drug trade.

135
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,750
Together, the two were responsible

136
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,125
for the largest methamphetamine
manufacturing operation in US history.

137
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,125
Sources speculate
the two had a falling out,

138
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,250
after which it is believed Pinkman
was manufacturing the drug

139
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,333
- for the group holding him captive.
- Go for Joe.

140
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,125
Police are now on the hunt for Pinkman

141
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,208
and urging the community
to remain vigilant.

142
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,083
They're asking anyone with information

143
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,750
- to contact APD or call Crimestoppers...
- Yeah, I know who this is.

144
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,833
At this point, who doesn't?

145
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,833
Hey.

146
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,541
- Where's the victim?
- It's in the back.

147
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,041
Look, thank you so much
for doing this, Joe.

148
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,125
About the money, if we can maybe...

149
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,458
It's on the house.

150
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,708
Good kid.

151
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,333
Least I can do.

152
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,625
Watch it, bitch!

153
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,291
You gentlemen threw me
plenty of business back in the day.

154
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,666
I got no complaints in that department.

155
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,083
Magnets!

156
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,041
Yeah.

157
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,375
That was a good one. So...

158
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,583
Frankly, you know, I can tell you now,

159
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,750
I had zero confidence that
that would work.

160
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,375
None whatsoever, but hey, live and learn.

161
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,666
Joe, what are you doing?

162
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,791
Writing myself a little insurance policy.

163
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,875
You know, strictly precautionary.

164
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,250
Belt and suspenders.

165
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,208
Okay.

166
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,666
All right, mind at ease, think we're good.

167
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,541
Joe! Joe!

168
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,166
Wait.

169
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,625
Joe, what are you doing?

170
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,958
Fleeing, and I suggest you do the same.

171
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,291
LoJack. The company just activated it,
just this minute.

172
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Talk about timing.

173
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,208
- Just...
- Look, Johnny Law is on his way,

174
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,791
as in here, as in now.

175
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,083
So farewell, goodbye, regrets,

176
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,416
etcetera etcetera.

177
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,208
Joe!

178
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,541
Skinny...

179
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,041
Sorry.

180
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,833
Who's got the keys to that car?

181
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,708
Keys!

182
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,000
Yo. Yo! What are you doing?
We gotta get this thing outta here.

183
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,208
Badger, give me the keys to your Fiero.

184
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,208
Why?

185
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,375
You take my car.

186
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,833
I don't even like your car.

187
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,708
Drives like a dick.

188
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,041
Badger drives my T-bird
200, 300 miles away and ditches it.

189
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,750
Think you'll be heading to Mexico?

190
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,208
No, not Mexico.

191
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,916
Right on, even better.

192
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,125
Leave it near the border.

193
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,166
Hide it, kind of,

194
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,000
but, yo, don't hide it so good
the cops can't find it.

195
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,250
Wipe it down for prints,
then hitchhike back.

196
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,333
Do not let nobody see you in that car.

197
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,958
- You, take Badger's Fiero.
- What about this car?

198
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,833
It stays right here.

199
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,666
Ain't like the cops
don't already know where it is.

200
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,125
I'll tell 'em you dropped by,
the two of us smoked a fat bowl,

201
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,041
traded pink slips, then you split.

202
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,333
I always wanted me an El Camino.

203
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,916
And that's church, yo.

204
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,375
I'll pass any lie detector they give me.

205
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,916
It's what's happening.

206
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,458
You got any cash?

207
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,458
Yo. Kick in, bitch.

208
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,541
I'm doing it. Jesus!

209
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,250
Guys, I don't know what to say.

210
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,708
Don't say nothing. Just go.

211
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,333
Seat belt. Speed limit.

212
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,666
You got about three hours
to get this thing down south.

213
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,625
I'll keep my mouth shut till then,
but after that,

214
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,500
they gonna be putting a APB out
on this bitch.

215
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,708
I'll get her there.

216
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,791
Take care of her, Jesse.

217
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,208
She's a special lady.

218
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,083
That right there is a clown car.

219
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,541
No self-respecting outlaw
would ever get caught dead in that thing.

220
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,833
That's why it's perfect, yo. Deep cover.

221
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,708
Vaya con Dios, amigo.

222
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,333
Oh, the El Camino,
let me see the keys.

223
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,541
Hold up.

224
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,916
Just might keep you from getting spotted.

225
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,916
Can't hurt, right?

226
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,625
Yo, Skinny.

227
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,333
Why you doing all this?

228
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,416
Dude...

229
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,291
you're my hero and shit.

230
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,166
Jesse?

231
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,458
You awake?

232
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,583
Jesse?

233
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,375
Yeah.

234
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,833
Everything good?

235
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,791
Yeah.

236
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,666
- Good.
- Great.

237
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,166
You want a cigarette?

238
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,750
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

239
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,625
Guy on KOB keeps calling for rain.

240
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,458
What do you think?

241
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,541
I don't know.

242
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:21,125
Guy said like
forty percent chance yesterday.

243
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,083
Sixty percent today.

244
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,291
Maybe it was even fifty yesterday.

245
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,083
But so far,

246
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,458
I mean, I... Yeah, I see clouds,

247
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:36,375
but I wouldn't call 'em rain clouds,
just regular...

248
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,375
regular cloud-clouds.

249
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,291
Anyway, that's what they look like to me.

250
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,333
Yeah, well, those guys aren't...

251
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,208
always that accurate.

252
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,791
Yeah, right.

253
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,750
I'm not putting myself out there
as any kind of expert

254
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,791
or whatnot,

255
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,083
but I do think it's gonna be...

256
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,666
a beautiful afternoon.

257
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,333
Guess what?

258
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,458
We're all alone.

259
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,458
Yeah?

260
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:20,250
Yeah. Uncle Jack took everybody down
to Elephant Butte,

261
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,625
on account of he got this new Chaparral.

262
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,333
It's pretty bad-ass,

263
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,666
but I told him...

264
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,750
I'm not really big into waterskiing,

265
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,208
plus, somebody's...

266
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,125
gotta take care of you.

267
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,416
Took some convincing, but...

268
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,583
now...

269
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,791
it's just you and me the whole weekend.

270
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,000
And I...
I'd really like your help with something.

271
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:55,833
So...

272
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,583
I hate to be all like...

273
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,875
But we gotta talk ground rules.

274
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:05,416
If you tried to, you know, escape,

275
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,375
I'm gonna have to visit the little boy.

276
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,875
It'll basically be...

277
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,416
out of my hands at that point.

278
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,791
Uncle Jack made you that promise,

279
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,666
and he's gonna want to stick to it.

280
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,166
So...

281
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,583
good behavior, right?

282
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,750
Right?

283
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,208
Good.

284
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,083
I appreciate it, Jesse.

285
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,666
Gotta make sure you don't...

286
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,250
draw too much attention.

287
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:53,458
I'ma do a better job
of keeping you clean from now on, okay?

288
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,458
Promise.

289
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,541
Good job.

290
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:09,958
Hey, check this out.

291
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,500
There's no water in it.

292
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,458
There used to be water in it,

293
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,958
but they took it out
a couple years ago 'cause of...

294
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,000
some insurance thing.

295
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,708
Okay, so,

296
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,625
it's not actually that heavy, but...

297
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:33,208
try as I might,
I can't ever get this thing on by myself.

298
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,458
What are you better at,
going forwards or backwards?

299
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,875
Okay, well,
let's both go sideways for a while.

300
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,875
Watch your fingers.

301
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,958
I thought maybe I could just

302
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
hang it from the ceiling here...

303
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,375
and just drive right under
and drop it in, but my...

304
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,166
landlord didn't really like that idea.

305
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,541
I guess that's good.

306
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,750
I found this thing on Craigslist.

307
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,041
So...

308
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:24,500
- Yeah.
- So is that what you needed help with?

309
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,291
Part of it.

310
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,875
The drug kingpin once known
throughout the southwest as Heisenberg

311
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,916
may yet claim a final victim.

312
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,500
Texas authorities investigating
the poisoning of a Houston woman

313
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:43,750
are looking into her possible connection
to Walter White's criminal organization.

314
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,958
The unnamed woman,
who is hospitalized in critical condition,

315
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,041
is not expected to survive.

316
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,333
White, the former Albuquerque
school teacher

317
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,041
who was the subject
of a six-month international manhunt,

318
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,333
was found dead late Tuesday
at the scene of a gang massacre

319
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,416
which claimed the lives of nine people.

320
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,833
The dollar is down today
on the foreign exchange markets

321
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,208
after an extremely turbulent week
for the euro.

322
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,291
The Dow Jones is down 15 points,

323
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,375
the NASDAQ is down 34 points,

324
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,750
and the S&P 500 is up ten points.

325
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:34,875
Have been moved indefinitely
after the discovery of asbestos

326
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,458
in 70 percent of the units.

327
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:39,125
All residents have been
temporarily relocated...

328
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,125
Hey there, look what the cat dragged in.

329
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:17,000
Did I hear voices?
Were you talking to somebody?

330
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,833
Nope, not that I know of.

331
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,875
Hey there, Lou. What you up to?

332
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,208
A little horticultural maintenance.

333
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,583
This ficus down at your end
has been looking kinda puny.

334
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,291
Gotta keep the thrift bugs off it.

335
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,833
So, is a ficus technically a plant
or a tree?

336
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,833
I'd say it all depends...

337
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,500
Keep in mind you got over 800 species
of the darned thing.

338
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:40,916
Well, all right, Lou, you have a good one.

339
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,416
Yeah. Don't take any wooden nickels.

340
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,458
Oh, man. That guy.

341
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,375
He's not supposed to be home at this hour.

342
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:04,250
We really lucked out
that he didn't see you.

343
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:10,000
He's just always lurking around,
being nosy.

344
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:14,791
I mean, he was in Vietnam,
which I totally respect, but still...

345
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,875
How you like my place?

346
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,625
Yeah, it's... it's nice.

347
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,458
Kinda...

348
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,416
pastel.

349
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,500
- But in a good way.
- Yeah, right?

350
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,791
I was thinking of Easter eggs,

351
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,458
but...

352
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,208
lately, I'm thinking I might like
to try some new paint.

353
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:38,083
This stuff is starting to feel
pretty tired.

354
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:39,958
Okay.

355
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,750
Sure, so, you... Is that why I'm here?
You want me to help you paint?

356
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,625
Maybe, yeah...

357
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,500
If we have some time left over.

358
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,833
But, first...

359
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:55,625
Oh, shit!

360
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,291
Jesus!

361
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,041
Todd...

362
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,583
What...

363
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:11,666
What...

364
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,708
Ah, shit!

365
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,416
Okay, please don't,

366
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,958
you know, make me feel worse
than I already do.

367
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,625
Who is this?

368
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,125
Sonia, my cleaning lady.

369
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,375
And honestly,

370
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,791
I don't feel much like
talking about it, so...

371
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,791
You want to give me a hand, Jesse?

372
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,208
Just keep it straight.

373
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,625
Oh, wait.

374
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,666
Unroll it.

375
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,708
Kinda need this.

376
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:21,875
Okay.

377
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,916
Now, we just gotta wait

378
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,583
for nosy Lou to go bowling.

379
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,416
I think he leaves in like an hour.

380
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,458
You want some soup?

381
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,708
You want soup?

382
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:42,000
I got chicken noodle, chicken and stars,
cream of chicken.

383
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,666
Bean with bacon.

384
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,583
One left, Jesse.

385
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,791
- What did she do to you?
- What?

386
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:55,208
Oh, she didn't do anything to me.

387
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,125
Then...

388
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,125
why?

389
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,416
Right there.

390
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
That book, if you wanna know so bad.

391
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:20,958
Uncle Jack taught me
always keep my money close, so...

392
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:26,250
I have these old World Book Encyclopedias,
the whole entire set.

393
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,333
A to Z.

394
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,541
My grammy gave 'em to me

395
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,291
when I was in middle school,
but I figured...

396
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,125
nobody needs books anymore,
'cause everything's on the computer.

397
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,000
It seemed like a good hiding place.

398
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:43,000
Plus, I had all these other volumes
left to fill.

399
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,416
So your cleaning lady
was stealing your money?

400
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,625
What? No.

401
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:57,375
She was as honest as the day is long.

402
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,833
Like, George Washington honest.

403
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,666
But she found it,

404
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,916
and I can't have anybody finding it.

405
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,000
She brought it straight in here
to show me.

406
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,625
She actually thought
I didn't know it was there.

407
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,750
I just... I wonder what the heck
she was looking up?

408
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,958
She barely spoke any English.

409
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,416
M for Mexico maybe? I don't know.

410
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,333
It's weird.

411
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,458
Where are we gonna... take her?

412
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,541
Someplace pretty.

413
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,791
She deserves that.

414
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:42,041
Hey, do me a favor
and put that away, would ya?

415
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,208
Just straight down the hall
all the way in the back,

416
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,833
there's a whole shelf of 'em.

417
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,125
Thanks.

418
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,500
Sure you don't want any soup?

419
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,208
How you like my bedroom?

420
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,041
Pretty bitchin', huh?

421
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,500
Be sure to alphabetize them.

422
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:55,458
I guess I better come up with
a new hiding place for my money.

423
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,416
They got these things called banks.

424
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,041
Actually,

425
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,916
I think I know the perfect spot.

426
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,041
It might take a little engineering, but...

427
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,958
Man, it would be right here
and nobody would ever find it.

428
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,875
Nothing beats cash on hand,
that's what Uncle Jack says.

429
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,916
- An average kid.
- Yeah.

430
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,125
I mean, he liked to draw.
He was good at that.

431
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,208
When was the last time you saw him?

432
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,666
A year. Maybe more. I mean...

433
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,750
it was way before all of this.

434
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,791
Is there anything you wish
you could say to your son right now?

435
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,541
Please...

436
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,375
come forward.

437
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,750
Too many people have...

438
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:40,375
For your sake, for everybody's sake,

439
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,125
son, turn yourself in.

440
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,666
<i>You're looking kinda lonely, girl</i>

441
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:55,625
<i>Would you like someone new to talk to</i>

442
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:59,625
<i>Ah, yeah, all right</i>

443
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:02,791
<i>I'm feeling kinda lonely too</i>

444
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,458
<i>If you don't mind</i>

445
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:08,083
<i>Can I sit down here beside you</i>

446
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,125
<i>Ah, yeah, all right</i>

447
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,125
<i>If I seem to come on too strong</i>

448
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:18,958
<i>I hope that you will understand</i>

449
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:21,416
<i>I say these things
'cause I'd like to know</i>

450
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,500
<i>If you're as lonely as I am</i>

451
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:26,291
<i>And if you mind</i>

452
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:29,375
<i>Sharing the night together</i>

453
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,125
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

454
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:35,500
<i>Sharing the night together</i>

455
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:38,375
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

456
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,625
<i>Sharing the night</i>

457
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,500
You wanna say a few words?

458
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:34,625
No.

459
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:46,125
Nice, nice lady.

460
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,958
Excellent housekeeper.

461
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:09,625
Hey, grab another pack, would ya?

462
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,000
There should be one in the glove box.

463
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,125
You find 'em?

464
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,541
I'll take that, Jesse.

465
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,791
Jesse, I'll... I'll take that.

466
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,791
On the way home,
I was gonna get us some pizza.

467
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,125
A couple large pies.

468
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,208
Maybe a six-pack of beer?

469
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:15,958
Some ice cold beer.

470
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,375
Does that sound good?

471
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,000
'Cause you earned it today.

472
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,708
You definitely did.

473
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:31,916
What kind of pizza do you like, Jesse?

474
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,541
Jesse, what kind of pizza?

475
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:47,708
Pepperoni.

476
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:49,500
Pepperoni. Sure.

477
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:52,250
Classic. I like that too.

478
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:42,500
Come on.

479
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:44,625
Look at that view.

480
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,833
Should be a heck of a sunset.

481
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,416
You know what Uncle Jack says...

482
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,833
Life is what you make it.

483
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,625
God!

484
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:50,916
Yeah!

485
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,291
Jesus!

486
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,041
Jesus!

487
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,375
Hello?

488
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:45,875
Oh, hey. You folks are back, huh?

489
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,250
When you search a place,
you really search it.

490
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,750
Sir, what can we do for you?

491
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:55,416
I'm Louis Schanzer.
I live across the hall, down in unit 11.

492
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,041
I talked to your guys yesterday.

493
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:58,833
I got a card from one of your sergeants,

494
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:00,875
and I just want you to know I'm around

495
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:03,416
if you ever need
any additional information.

496
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,333
Okay. Great.

497
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,375
See, I knew the decedent pretty well,

498
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:09,125
never really trusted him.

499
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,958
To be honest,
I kinda saw this thing coming.

500
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,458
I mean, well, not exactly, but kinda.

501
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:17,041
Yeah, great.
Well, we'll definitely keep that in mind.

502
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:18,833
Yeah. Definitely, thank you.

503
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,916
You guys have business cards?

504
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,791
No, I'm sorry, we're fresh out.
Take it easy.

505
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:27,458
You too, and hey, listen,
if you ever need any help with this case,

506
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,333
see I've done
a little investigating myself...

507
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,583
Unit 11.

508
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,250
Okay.

509
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,083
I'll start here, you start in the back.
Let's meet in the middle.

510
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:54,958
I mean, Jesus.

511
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:04,375
Neil, they've tossed the shit
out of this place. What's left to find?

512
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,750
Shut up and look.

513
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,125
Hey, little guy.

514
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:38,750
Dude's got a tarantula.

515
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,500
Yeah, no crazy in this house.

516
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,375
Perfectly normal.

517
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,041
I'm no cop killer.

518
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:12,666
You be cool...

519
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,875
and I will be cool.

520
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:17,833
Understand?

521
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,000
Call your partner in here.

522
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:41,708
Casual, very casual.

523
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:42,833
Do it.

524
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:45,791
Hey, Lieutenant.

525
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,250
Lieutenant, you hear me?

526
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:57,500
Yeah.

527
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,541
Come in here, would ya?

528
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,833
You find something?

529
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:17,958
Yeah, pretty much.

530
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,041
Lieutenant?

531
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,250
What's waiting for me back there, Casey?

532
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,333
- Put your gun down!
- Okay, relax, relax.

533
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:06,250
Put your gun down
and show me your hands!

534
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,875
Everybody relax.

535
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,625
He says he's not looking
to kill any cops.

536
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:13,416
So let's just...

537
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,791
let's figure this out, all right?

538
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:17,625
Let's...
We're gonna figure this out.

539
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,333
What are you doing here, Pinkman?

540
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,625
There's something I need.

541
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,708
As soon as I get it, I am gone.

542
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:27,458
You let me outta here,
I swear I will not hurt this guy.

543
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:28,916
What's this thing you need?

544
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,833
Seriously, throw your gun in here
and show me your hands.

545
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,458
Seriously, no. You point yours at me,
I point mine at you.

546
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:35,833
That's how this works.

547
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,416
What's this thing you need?

548
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,083
Look... I don't wanna shoot any cops.

549
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,208
Yeah, you don't wanna shoot any cops.
Great, fantastic.

550
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:46,875
You know how many officers
we got downstairs?

551
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:50,333
Tell him, Casey, tell him how many.

552
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,583
A good six, last I counted.

553
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:55,083
Six my ass,
I counted eight of 'em down there.

554
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:58,458
Patrol car on all four corners,
more up the street.

555
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:01,250
They hear shooting,
what do you think they're gonna do?

556
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:04,208
Oh, they're coming up.
They're coming up, guaranteed.

557
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:06,291
That's right, they're coming up.

558
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,750
Then how far do you think
you're gonna get?

559
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,916
There's only one choice here, buddy.

560
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:13,875
And you know what it is.

561
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,166
Come on.

562
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:18,916
Nobody wants to hurt you.

563
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,041
Give up, Pinkman.

564
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,375
It's your only chance.

565
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,958
On the ground. Guns down.

566
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:50,875
On your stomach.

567
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,666
Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?

568
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,458
Are you kidding me?

569
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,291
- What now?
- Stay on him.

570
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,541
All right.

571
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:13,708
Hey! What are you doing?

572
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,500
Shut up.

573
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:18,416
Hey, how about some handcuffs, yo.

574
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:21,875
What are you doing?

575
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,083
You two aren't cops.

576
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:30,708
You...

577
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:35,000
Shut the fuck up.

578
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:36,666
His legs! Get his legs.

579
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:41,208
Find me something to gag him with.

580
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,000
No!

581
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,291
I know where the money is.

582
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,791
That's what you're here for, right?

583
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:03,041
You picked up a couple of windbreakers
at the Army & Navy store,

584
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,375
came strolling in, all clever and shit.

585
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,208
Well, I know where it is.

586
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:12,375
And I guaran-fucking-tee
you won't find it on your own.

587
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:21,250
Detectives? Louis Schanzer, unit 11.

588
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:23,458
I got somethin' that might be helpful.

589
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:25,750
Hello?

590
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,916
Detectives? Everything okay?

591
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:36,333
Sorry about that, sir. We're...

592
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,791
dusting for fingerprints, you know?
It's a delicate process.

593
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,750
I thought your CSI boys do that.

594
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,625
Didn't they get 'em all yesterday?

595
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:48,625
Yeah, well, you know, sometimes,
you want something done right...

596
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,291
Oh, God, tell me about it.

597
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:53,125
My line was restaurant
and hospitality supplies,

598
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:54,708
so I completely get it.

599
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:59,375
Hey, listen, I just came across
an old note Todd Alquist wrote me.

600
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:01,458
- Figured it may be of interest.
- Oh, really?

601
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:02,375
Yeah.

602
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,750
Sort of a half-assed apology
he slipped under my door.

603
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:09,041
I'd gone to our landlord
about this stupid truck cap of his

604
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,083
everybody kept tripping over, and...

605
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:15,916
Well, anyway, if you need
a handwriting sample for analysis.

606
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,208
That's...
Yeah, yeah, that could be...

607
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,125
- Yeah, sure.
- Left it inside.

608
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:23,083
Didn't want to touch it,
speaking of fingerprints.

609
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,416
You're welcome to come examine it.

610
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,750
Oh, it's no trouble. I got time.

611
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,250
Show me the money, I let you go.

612
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,041
Hey.

613
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:49,000
What do you say, huh?

614
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:50,875
Seems pretty fair to me.

615
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,125
Oh, shit!

616
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:22,291
- Holy shit!
- Keep your voice down.

617
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,458
God, there's gotta be...

618
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,750
There's gotta be a million here.
Yeah.

619
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,208
What are you doing?

620
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,583
Taking my half.

621
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,333
Yeah?

622
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,541
A little man with big dreams? Yeah?

623
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,666
Hey, if I were you,

624
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,166
I'd walk the hell outta here right now.

625
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,458
I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch.

626
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,916
I will shoot you.

627
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,625
Then do it already.

628
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,500
If I don't get this money,

629
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,416
I am dead anyway.

630
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:14,708
All right? If you pull that trigger,

631
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:19,000
then you are gonna have to kill
that loudmouth down the hall

632
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:21,416
and every other witness in the place.

633
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:25,208
Then you will be as fucked as I am.

634
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,333
So...

635
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,458
what's it gonna be?

636
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:48,291
Three-way split.
And you got your third.

637
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:50,958
Don't push it.

638
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:20,416
- Yep?
- Don't react, just listen.

639
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,375
I got the money.

640
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,833
You gotta keep him talking
for the next five minutes.

641
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:27,375
Since I got the Brita,

642
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,500
I find the tea tastes noticeably better.

643
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,458
Not a problem.

644
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:19,166
You got balls, I'll give you that.

645
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,291
Can I get my gun back?

646
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,458
Fuck you. Go buy one.

647
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,000
I was wondering
when you were gonna remember me.

648
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,250
It's colorful, I'll say that much.

649
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,250
Yes, it is.

650
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:11,208
I don't expect
you'd ever lose it in your closet.

651
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:14,750
And no dirt bag to replace?

652
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,916
That's correct.

653
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,916
A lot of our customers find that handy
and practical.

654
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,208
But they want an arm and a leg
to pay for it.

655
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:24,333
And I ain't paying for no paint job.

656
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:26,666
Yes, I agree. It's very expensive.

657
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,250
But it's a fine product.

658
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,291
However, if you are in love
with your Kirby,

659
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,666
I'll bet I could get it
working for you again.

660
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,291
Be with you in a minute.

661
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,833
Fixing my Kirby,
how much would that cost?

662
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:44,000
Well, I won't know
until I take a good look at it, and it...

663
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,625
and if it needed a new motor,
it'd be a little bit expensive,

664
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,916
but certainly not as expensive
as a new Dyson.

665
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,750
The estimate's free, and...

666
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:55,625
all you gotta do is bring it in here.

667
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,791
- I may take you up on that.
- Excellent.

668
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:01,041
If I can get my niece to help me.
They make 'em so heavy.

669
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:02,166
Yes, they do,

670
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,958
and I want you to promise
you won't try to bring it in by yourself.

671
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,833
Get that help.

672
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:11,291
I just don't know why they can't
make things to last anymore.

673
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:13,416
You're singing my song.

674
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,708
I want you to have a great day now.

675
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,250
Thank you, thanks for your help.
I'll be back with my Kirby.

676
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:21,333
Excellent. Drive carefully.

677
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,583
If there's any questions I can answer,
just let me know.

678
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,041
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that.

679
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:49,375
I'm open for business.

680
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,000
I'm looking for a...

681
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,041
Hoover Max.

682
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,833
Pressure Max, Max Pressure.

683
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:02,541
Hoover, or maybe it's a Pro Max.

684
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,333
Got like a... like a filter.

685
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:08,541
Hoover products are right over there
on the wall behind you.

686
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,958
Look, I don't remember
the exact, like, password.

687
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,083
All right? But it was a vacuum thing.

688
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,666
Okay, fine.

689
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:19,625
Here you go.

690
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,416
Four...

691
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:26,916
six...

692
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:29,750
ten...

693
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,291
fourteen,

694
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,791
sixteen, eighteen,

695
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,250
twenty, twenty-two...

696
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,041
twenty-four, twenty-five.

697
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,416
There you go.

698
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,000
$125,000.

699
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:49,500
Come on, man, you know why I'm here.

700
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,708
I can't say I do, no.

701
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, you do. You're the guy.

702
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,125
Yeah, you do.

703
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,791
You're the guy.

704
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:04,583
Look, I am 96 percent sure
that you are the guy,

705
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:06,500
so why don't you just, like, admit it?

706
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,708
Look, all right, no wire.

707
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:13,833
Okay? No wire.

708
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,208
And no gun.

709
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,208
Okay? And nobody knows I'm here.

710
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:18,583
I just need...

711
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,833
just need your services.

712
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,541
The day at the pickup spot,
you pulled up in a minivan,

713
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,458
a red Toyota minivan.

714
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:27,958
Looks like a kidney bean.

715
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:30,833
Same exact minivan
you got parked out back.

716
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,458
All right? I saw it.

717
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,000
All right.

718
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,833
You got rules. All right.

719
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:43,250
I get that, and I apologize, seriously.

720
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,000
I didn't go with you that day,
and I am sorry.

721
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:50,583
Look, you will never know how sorry,

722
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,083
but I am here now.

723
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,333
All right? And I have cash.

724
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,583
So, please?

725
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:58,916
Okay?

726
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:00,333
Please?

727
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,791
- You owe me for that first pickup.
- Yes!

728
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,000
You're the gu...

729
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,583
- Wait, what?
- This...

730
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,750
is previously-owed.

731
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,125
Going forward,

732
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,791
were we to,

733
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:30,541
would require an additional 125.

734
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:37,041
All right.

735
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:38,375
Fair is fair.

736
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,041
A deal's a deal.

737
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,583
All right. Look...

738
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,083
Four...

739
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:49,916
eight...

740
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,000
ten,

741
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:54,416
fourteen, eighteen...

742
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:56,708
twenty...

743
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,958
twenty...

744
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:07,416
Twenty-two.

745
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,625
Twenty-two.

746
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:13,750
Yeah.

747
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:17,625
Twenty-three.

748
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:21,375
By my arithmetic, you're $10,000 shy.

749
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:52,333
Eighty-two hundred.

750
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,000
Eighty-two hundred.

751
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:02,000
May I borrow this?

752
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,791
What are you doing?

753
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:14,000
I'm gathering your belongings.

754
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,791
No, no no. No, no. Stop.

755
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,166
I'm not gonna try to collect
what you owe me.

756
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:21,208
I don't think it would end well
for either one of us.

757
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,958
This is not an inconsequential
amount of money.

758
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,041
Hey, listen to me.

759
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:27,791
Spend it wisely,
it will last you for years.

760
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:29,625
Please, you don't understand.

761
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:32,583
Keep a low profile, travel by night.

762
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:33,875
Oh, God.

763
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,000
With a little luck,

764
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:40,166
you will soon find yourself
many miles from here.

765
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,250
Godspeed to you.

766
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,125
So that's it?

767
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,208
That's it.

768
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,458
Now, please leave.

769
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:53,750
You are going to jack me up

770
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:56,875
over a measly $1,800?

771
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,500
I've got to reopen.

772
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,208
The longer you stick around here,

773
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,208
the more you jeopardize yourself.

774
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:06,708
No, hey...

775
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,791
No, hey...

776
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,208
Have you been watching the news?

777
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,000
I have. Very much so.

778
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,166
So you hear
what they've been saying about me.

779
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

780
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,625
Look, these people,

781
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,500
they have kept me in a concrete hole.

782
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,291
Look, I don't even know what month it is.

783
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:35,000
They made me watch when they...
when they shot someone...

784
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:38,041
If you believe that you can
pull on people's heartstrings,

785
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,333
you should take your chances
with the police.

786
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,541
From where I sit, you made your own luck.

787
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,083
As did your former partner.

788
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:47,916
As did your lawyer.

789
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,833
You said it yourself, a deal's a deal.

790
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:54,666
No.

791
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:00,625
I am not going anywhere.

792
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:04,083
I am staying right here

793
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:06,333
until you help me.

794
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,500
What are you doing?

795
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,541
Hi, yes.

796
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:26,375
There's a young man in my store,

797
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,000
and he refuses to leave.

798
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,541
Hey, stop.

799
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:30,583
I...

800
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,750
- Yeah, he might be armed.
- Stop it.

801
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,916
Not overtly.

802
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,541
But, yes,
I'm beginning to feel threatened.

803
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,625
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

804
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:42,541
My name is Ed Galbraith.

805
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:45,250
I own Best Quality Vacuum,

806
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:48,458
2714, 4th Street.

807
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,625
Northwest. That's correct.

808
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:55,125
I would appreciate it very much
if you'd send someone immediately.

809
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:15,625
You are so full of crap.

810
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,041
You didn't call anybody just now.

811
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,500
You faked it.

812
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,375
And you wanna know how I know?

813
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:24,458
You got as much to lose as I do.

814
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,083
More. Way more.

815
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:30,708
When your cops get here
and they bust me,

816
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,416
first question they're gonna ask
is what am I doing here,

817
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,875
trying to hand over
a Hefty bag full of cash

818
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:40,166
to a dude who runs
a vacuum cleaner store.

819
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:42,791
What comes out then? Huh?

820
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:47,208
Oh, and you wanna know
what else is bullshit?

821
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:49,291
You know, like, word to the wise.

822
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:52,416
Next time to try to pull this shit
on someone,

823
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:56,416
you don't just hang up on a 911 call.

824
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,333
They won't let you.

825
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:03,208
Because the lady, or dude, or whoever
is like, stay on the line with me, sir.

826
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:06,500
Stay on the line
until the officers arrive.

827
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:10,500
And if you did hang up,
they'd call you back immediately.

828
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,791
But, hey, guess what?

829
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:15,791
Seriously, yo. Pathetic.

830
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:20,791
Wow, you gotta love that response time.

831
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:24,791
Take your money.

832
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,916
Officers, thank you very much
for getting here so fast.

833
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,375
- He obviously heard my call and...
- Is he still here?

834
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,833
No, he's not, he's gone. I...

835
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:49,916
He was spooked by my phone call

836
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,333
and he headed up northbound...

837
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:55,458
on foot maybe 30 seconds ago.

838
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,583
- Can you describe him?
- Sure I can.

839
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,625
He was...

840
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,291
young, he's white,

841
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,250
skinny, very tall guy.

842
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:04,916
Six-five, six-six.

843
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,333
Had a tattoo over his right eyebrow.

844
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:12,000
Interesting. A large insect.

845
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,958
Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?

846
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,833
A deal's a deal? Your word is your bond?

847
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,208
It is.

848
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,250
I'll get you your money.

849
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:24,291
Hello?

850
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:26,333
Hey, Mom.

851
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:28,791
Jesse?

852
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:30,541
It's Jesse.

853
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:33,625
Give me... Give me the phone.

854
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,166
Jesse, is that you?

855
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,625
Hey, Dad. Yeah, it's me.

856
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,333
How the both of you doing?

857
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,166
We've been better.

858
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:44,708
Yeah.

859
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:48,291
How's Jake? Can I say hi to him?

860
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,875
Jake's on a band trip to London,
thank God...

861
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:52,750
Jesse, where are you?

862
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:56,458
I heard you saying
that I should turn myself in.

863
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:59,250
Yes. It's the right thing to do.

864
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,666
Quit running and get some help.

865
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,541
No one is trying to hurt you, son.

866
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:07,750
Better you come forward on your own,
it'll be safer for you, better all around.

867
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:10,708
You remember where
we used to have those picnics?

868
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:12,041
All those years ago?

869
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:14,708
By the little lake,
the one with all the ducks?

870
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:15,916
Yeah?

871
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,166
Do you think you guys
could come get me maybe?

872
01:21:26,416 --> 01:21:28,041
- We're on our way.
- Hey.

873
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:29,291
And...

874
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,416
it's probably too late to say this...

875
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:34,625
I don't know if it'll mean much to you...

876
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:40,541
but you did your best.

877
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:43,791
And whatever happened with me...

878
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,125
it's on me.

879
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:48,291
Okay?

880
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:50,833
Nobody else.

881
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:02,666
We're heading northbound on 12th,
about to turn left on Lomas.

882
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,083
- Be sure to stay on the house.
- Will do.

883
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:02,708
Jake's birthday.

884
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:12,041
Yeah. Yeah.

885
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:15,916
And then after that,
it's the first turn off Broadway.

886
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:20,541
No, then you're gonna go ahead
and look for...

887
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,125
Nah, man, don't go by junkyards.

888
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:24,791
There's like 50 junkyards.

889
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:26,541
The rebar place is what...

890
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:28,583
Yeah, the re...

891
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,875
Yeah, exactly.

892
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,333
That's the one.

893
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,500
Turn there.

894
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:38,750
Yeah. Straight down on the right.

895
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:39,916
Look for the sign.

896
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,166
Oh, yeah, I got you.

897
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:59,125
They're here!

898
01:28:01,225 --> 01:28:03,083
All right!

899
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:10,208
Yeah, okay. Oh, my God.

900
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:14,125
Yeah.

901
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,708
- Keep your mouth shut.
- All right.

902
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:17,958
- All right.
- Oh, shit.

903
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:21,083
- Oh, shit.
- That's a big, big boy.

904
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:23,083
This guy's bigger than your mom, Sean.

905
01:28:23,166 --> 01:28:24,625
Who's Kandy?

906
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,500
Yeah, that's me.

907
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:30,500
- The car's too small for you.
- $750 an hour, cash up front.

908
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,458
- Oh, man.
- The perks are extra.

909
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:33,791
Well, by all means.

910
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:36,208
- I get the first perk.
- We want the perks.

911
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:38,333
Perks, perks! Yeah!

912
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:40,916
- Don't we, boys? Yeah?
- We want the perks!

913
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,041
- Perks!
- Got any perks in there?

914
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:45,291
Oh, my God!

915
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,916
That's what I'm talking about.

916
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,625
- Gentlemen, hi.
- That's a good start. And hello to you.

917
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,416
- Hello to you.
- Hi, welcome.

918
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
- Where have you been all my life?
- Excuse me.

919
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,791
Oh, just waiting for you
in this little car.

920
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:59,041
- Oh, I'm here, baby, don't worry.
- Please, come right this way.

921
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:01,833
Careful, careful now.

922
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:04,291
Should've brought your work boots.

923
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:06,416
Well, nobody told me
it was gonna be yucky.

924
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,708
My name is Casey.

925
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,333
I never really go for redheads.

926
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:35,750
All right.

927
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:37,541
Done.

928
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:39,208
Bullshit you're done.

929
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,750
You've been here 20 minutes,
what'd you do?

930
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,833
Added a fishplate up here,

931
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:45,166
one in the middle, one down at the end.

932
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,333
Added a what?

933
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:47,416
A fishplate.

934
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,750
What, like a... plate of fish?

935
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:52,041
What the fuck is that?
Is that even a real word?

936
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:53,916
Look, man, I want more of those things,

937
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,041
the sideway diagonal things,
like twice as many.

938
01:29:57,541 --> 01:29:58,583
Those are gussets.

939
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:01,333
You got enough of 'em already.

940
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:05,708
Okay, yeah. So, gussets I got out the ass,
but a fishplate I need 'cause... What?

941
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,416
I'm Catholic and it's Friday?

942
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:12,708
You sure you couldn't just put
a few more gussets up there, Neil?

943
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:14,708
I mean, what could it hurt, right?

944
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:16,166
Hey, it's your money.

945
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,041
But what I just did,
you don't even need that.

946
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,458
I told you I built this thing right.

947
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:24,333
Look, bro, I'm not like impugning
on your precious welding skills.

948
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:28,708
It's just we have a
unique situation here.

949
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:40,375
Tried to rabbit on us once already.

950
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:44,458
I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way
to break this thing.

951
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:45,958
You kidding me?

952
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,416
Him?

953
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:50,958
Yeah, it's just I kinda feel it flexing
a little bit. A bit right here, look.

954
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:56,541
Yeah, see? Right there.
Yeah, a little bit.

955
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,291
Yeah, I don't see jack shit flexing.

956
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:01,541
That's four-inch channel iron up there.

957
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:03,125
You could hang an F150 from it

958
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,791
and shove it back and forth
like a beach ball.

959
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:06,875
It's going nowhere.

960
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:10,916
Okay, you and your big four inches.
It's just this little bastard's wiry.

961
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I don't care how wiry he is.
Have him knock himself out.

962
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:17,375
Oh, yeah?

963
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,666
Wanna put your money
where your mouth is?

964
01:31:22,291 --> 01:31:25,000
Fifty bucks says he breaks this thing
right here, right now.

965
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:26,416
Fifty, plus,

966
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:30,708
then you gotta put up more of those...
What'd you call 'em, gussets?

967
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:31,833
No charge.

968
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:34,208
Throw in some fishplates too,
while you're at it.

969
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:36,791
You're on.

970
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:37,958
I'm on, huh?

971
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:40,750
All right, all right.
Get that shit out the way and watch this.

972
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:42,625
All right, good-lookin'.

973
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:45,125
This is it. This is the acid test.

974
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:46,750
Go for it.

975
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:51,625
Now! Go, go, go! Come on!

976
01:31:52,416 --> 01:31:54,166
Faster! Hit it hard!

977
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:57,541
All right, all right.
Other way, other way.

978
01:31:57,625 --> 01:32:00,500
Hey, what are you slowing down for?
Hit it!

979
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:04,041
All right, come on, get up.

980
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:06,791
I got 50 bucks riding on you.
I gotta eat this month.

981
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:10,375
Kenny, if he breaks his leg,
he's not gonna be able to cook.

982
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:13,625
What, are you the fucking HR department?
Jesus, Toddie, relax.

983
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,541
We're gonna even up the odds a little bit.

984
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:19,250
All right.

985
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,708
Okay.

986
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,083
Now, I believe in you.

987
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:25,416
You're gonna John Henry this bitch, yeah?

988
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,416
Now go.

989
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:28,375
Go, go, go! Let's go!

990
01:32:28,458 --> 01:32:31,125
Go, go, go, go! Yeah!

991
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:36,958
All right, other way. Faster!
Hit it hard!

992
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:38,250
Yeah, baby!

993
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:40,208
Yeah! Caught some air.

994
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:45,416
Yeah!

995
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:47,333
Todd, who is this guy anyway?

996
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:48,875
What'd he do?

997
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:53,625
It's... It's kind of a long story.

998
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,875
Yeah.

999
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,375
He's a rat.

1000
01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:00,375
That's all you need to know.

1001
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,125
- Hey, hey!
- Okay, guys.

1002
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:37,333
- We dancing or what?
- You paid till three

1003
01:33:37,416 --> 01:33:38,708
and it's five past.

1004
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,833
Hell, I'll go another hour.
Come on, we all will.

1005
01:33:42,958 --> 01:33:44,500
Where you going? Huh?

1006
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,583
- Come on.
- Wanda!

1007
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:51,583
Hey, Wanda!

1008
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:55,083
Wanda!

1009
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:57,125
Would you stop? You're crazy.

1010
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,333
Ya Opie-lookin' self.

1011
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,916
- We'll see you next week.
- In your dreams, buddy.

1012
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:14,750
Just wanna go home, get in my bed,

1013
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:16,916
cuddle with my dog.

1014
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:18,833
I am exhausted.

1015
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:21,250
I'm never coming back
to this dump place again.

1016
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,500
My feet hurt.

1017
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:27,041
Wake up, Clarence, let's go.

1018
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:30,583
Look at my fucking shoes. I know.
This is a mess.

1019
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:32,666
It wasn't even worth it.

1020
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:35,125
It's gonna take me hours
to get the mud out.

1021
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:37,833
Wait for me!

1022
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:09,708
I said, my son,

1023
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:12,666
cocaine wasn't even invented
when Brigham Young was born.

1024
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,541
It's okay, you can have some.

1025
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,750
Come on, come to papa. There we go.

1026
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:20,750
- You'll never get that back.
- There he goes.

1027
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:23,458
- Black diamond.
- Bye-bye, cocaine.

1028
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:25,083
He's all cocaine and Mormons.

1029
01:36:02,666 --> 01:36:03,583
What's up?

1030
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:05,208
I need more money.

1031
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:07,333
Oh, yeah?

1032
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,500
That three-way split
didn't quite cover it for me.

1033
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:14,666
I'd appreciate you helping me out.

1034
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:17,666
Well, what's he talking about?
Three-way split?

1035
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,000
You mean there was a third more?

1036
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,250
And you gave it to him?

1037
01:36:22,291 --> 01:36:23,958
It's a long story.

1038
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:25,916
Well...

1039
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:27,250
What long story?

1040
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:29,833
When I left,
he didn't even have a fucking gun.

1041
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,625
Well, he's got one now, doesn't he?

1042
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:34,750
So, you know, shut up. Let me handle this.

1043
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:36,541
Neil, who the hell is this guy?

1044
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:38,958
Yeah, I can't believe you just
let him walk in here with...

1045
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:40,958
Shut up means everybody.

1046
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:46,250
Now,

1047
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:49,750
how exactly do you plan
on pulling this off?

1048
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:53,375
I mean, being that there's five of us
and one of you.

1049
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:57,291
I'm not here to rob you.

1050
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,041
Oh, you're not?

1051
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:01,666
Then how's this work?

1052
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:05,833
All I need is $1,800.

1053
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:08,208
I'm asking as a...

1054
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:09,708
a favor.

1055
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,583
Oh, what, like charity?

1056
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:15,291
Seems to me this silly son of a bitch
already forked over, big time.

1057
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:17,250
Casey, seriously, shut up.

1058
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,250
$1,800, huh?

1059
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:23,166
Why not an even two grand?

1060
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,875
You know, nice round number.

1061
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,375
$1,800 is all I need.

1062
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,166
So, what's the gun for?
It's like personal protection?

1063
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:33,458
I mean, is that a...

1064
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,541
What is that? Let me see that thing.
Show me.

1065
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:43,000
Oh, my God, is that a .22?

1066
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,583
You brought a .22?

1067
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:46,875
Jesus!

1068
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:49,041
Where'd you get that thing?

1069
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,875
I think it was my grandfather's.

1070
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:52,625
Oh, well, it's adorable.

1071
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:54,708
I know we got empty beer cans around here

1072
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:56,291
if you wanna do some plinking?

1073
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,583
Eighteen hundred.

1074
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:03,458
I'm gone forever.

1075
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:05,333
Simple as that.

1076
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:09,500
Neil, I swear to God, if you give
this piece of shit one more dollar...

1077
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:36,916
Cold out here.

1078
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:41,958
Tell you what.

1079
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:48,125
My third is in a duffel bag
in the top drawer of that file cabinet.

1080
01:38:50,583 --> 01:38:51,750
Where's yours?

1081
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:55,625
In my car.

1082
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:57,625
Parked up the street.

1083
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,083
What do you say...

1084
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:03,291
your .22...

1085
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:05,458
against my .45?

1086
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,416
Winner takes all.

1087
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:11,583
- Like the Wild West?
- Yeah.

1088
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:13,833
Like the Wild West.

1089
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:16,833
What? Come on.

1090
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:24,375
Jesus! Neil?

1091
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,250
- Come on, man, I didn't mean this...
- Casey.

1092
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:30,333
Shut the fuck up.

1093
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:35,041
- I'm not gonna get in another...
- No, wait, you go...

1094
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:36,916
Shoot!

1095
01:39:41,583 --> 01:39:42,625
You ready?

1096
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:46,541
Yeah.

1097
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:55,208
Hey, don't shoot.

1098
01:40:55,791 --> 01:40:57,041
All right. Get over here.

1099
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:59,541
- Please.
- All right, get up!

1100
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:04,833
All right.

1101
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:06,791
Give me your license.

1102
01:41:08,416 --> 01:41:10,583
- Driver's license, do it!
- Yes.

1103
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,250
I got kids.

1104
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:19,958
Like I give a shit.

1105
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:22,083
All right.

1106
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:23,875
Sean,

1107
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:25,291
Kyle,

1108
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:27,291
Colin.

1109
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:29,208
I know where you live.

1110
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,625
You tell the cops about me,

1111
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:35,416
and I am coming
for every goddamn one of you.

1112
01:41:36,541 --> 01:41:38,291
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1113
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:43,041
Go.

1114
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:44,916
Go!

1115
01:41:51,416 --> 01:41:52,708
Dude, you're on fire.

1116
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,916
Of course I miss you.

1117
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:48,500
Yeah? Well...

1118
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,750
do you miss me?

1119
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:56,208
I don't know.

1120
01:43:57,791 --> 01:44:00,250
How you...
How are you gonna convince me?

1121
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:03,583
Yeah, bitch.

1122
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,666
Thank you.

1123
01:45:19,416 --> 01:45:20,750
Leave the pitcher, would ya?

1124
01:45:21,166 --> 01:45:23,375
- Sorry, can't really do that.
- Wait.

1125
01:45:28,083 --> 01:45:28,916
Sure you can.

1126
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:39,166
- It's like I'm here with Sinatra.
- I know, right?

1127
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:44,083
Certainly went big with the pineapple.

1128
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:46,458
Only an asshole doesn't like pineapple.

1129
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,375
Guessing you don't?

1130
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:50,583
I can take it or leave it.

1131
01:45:51,416 --> 01:45:53,875
Pineapple's good for you.
It's got bromide.

1132
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:55,041
Bromelain.

1133
01:45:55,625 --> 01:45:56,833
But, close.

1134
01:45:58,208 --> 01:46:00,041
Actually, it's not close at all.

1135
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:02,291
Are you gonna eat?
You should really eat something.

1136
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:03,875
No, I'm eating. I'll eat.

1137
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:05,458
Gotta eat, gotta hydrate.

1138
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:07,541
Get those electrolytes
you were talking about.

1139
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:09,833
- Your sodium, you know, all that shit.
- Good, yeah.

1140
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,750
Yeah.

1141
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,833
Hey.

1142
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:23,041
- He's all right.
- I'm fine, thank you.

1143
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:24,958
- You all right?
- I'm fine. Good.

1144
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:26,166
- Sit down.
- All right.

1145
01:46:42,541 --> 01:46:44,625
How long will it take to sell this batch?

1146
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:49,250
- Six months.
- Jeez...

1147
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:50,458
Easy. Maybe more.

1148
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,541
There's no one that you can think of
who might...

1149
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:55,125
buy the entire amount?

1150
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:58,666
Someone with a spare $1.3 million
lying around? No.

1151
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:00,500
Can't say that I do.

1152
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:10,291
Your family is gonna get every dime
they got coming to them, Mr. White.

1153
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:12,916
No matter how long it takes.

1154
01:47:19,583 --> 01:47:21,916
- Hydrate. Seriously.
- Yeah.

1155
01:47:30,875 --> 01:47:32,916
What about you, Jesse?

1156
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:36,208
After this. What then?

1157
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:41,333
Nothing? What about college?

1158
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:46,458
No, what is stopping you
from going to college?

1159
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:51,500
- Nothing, I guess.
- Yeah, nothing at all.

1160
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:54,958
Say you went to college.

1161
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:57,666
What would you study, you think, eh?

1162
01:47:58,208 --> 01:47:59,166
What interests you?

1163
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,416
Sports Medicine?

1164
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,166
Sports Medicine.

1165
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:07,416
Yeah.

1166
01:48:08,666 --> 01:48:11,000
That's... Yeah, sure. That's...

1167
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:12,875
- Yeah.
- Could...

1168
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:16,416
Or... Business.

1169
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:18,083
Business and Marketing.

1170
01:48:19,083 --> 01:48:21,666
You could practically teach that class.

1171
01:48:21,916 --> 01:48:24,375
- Well, yeah.
- I mean, you'd be a natural.

1172
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:29,375
And with a Business degree,
I mean, that's handy anywhere.

1173
01:48:30,791 --> 01:48:31,750
Yeah.

1174
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:34,625
- Yeah, I guess that could be cool.
- Yeah.

1175
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:36,000
You could do it too.

1176
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,541
First step,

1177
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,750
get your GED, that's no problem.

1178
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:44,291
What do I need a GED for?

1179
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:45,750
I got my diploma.

1180
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:51,875
Of course, yeah, right.
Right, right, right.

1181
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:54,750
Yo, you were standing right on stage
when they handed it to me.

1182
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:56,500
I know, it just slipped my mind.

1183
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:59,500
I totally graduated high school, dick.

1184
01:48:59,583 --> 01:49:02,208
- Which is no thanks to you, all right?
- Just stay on the subject here.

1185
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:03,166
All right?

1186
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:05,583
The larger point being...

1187
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:11,625
You know, look, forget it.
I don't have a larger point.

1188
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:14,125
- I'm just making conversation.
- Yeah.

1189
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:24,375
You're really lucky, you know that?

1190
01:49:29,083 --> 01:49:32,291
You didn't have to wait your whole life
to do something special.

1191
01:51:27,958 --> 01:51:29,416
This is Alaska.

1192
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:32,083
This is Alaska.

1193
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:38,041
Forty miles in that direction
gets you to Haines.

1194
01:51:41,458 --> 01:51:42,625
It's quiet.

1195
01:51:44,166 --> 01:51:45,083
Yeah.

1196
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,333
Figured you could use some of that.

1197
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:55,166
All right.

1198
01:51:55,833 --> 01:51:56,833
Date of birth?

1199
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,625
06/10/84.

1200
01:52:00,125 --> 01:52:01,833
- Mother's maiden name.
- Stackhouse.

1201
01:52:02,375 --> 01:52:03,500
Where was she born?

1202
01:52:03,916 --> 01:52:06,500
Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan.

1203
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:08,000
Father's date of birth.

1204
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:10,000
02/07/51.

1205
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:12,916
Your father's second to the last job.

1206
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:17,958
Claims adjuster, Dairyland Insurance,
Appleton, Wisconsin.

1207
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:19,833
What's your social security number?

1208
01:52:19,916 --> 01:52:22,958
141-18-6941.

1209
01:52:23,208 --> 01:52:24,083
Backward.

1210
01:52:27,041 --> 01:52:31,791
1496-81-141.

1211
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,166
All right.

1212
01:52:35,083 --> 01:52:37,500
Daylight's burning,
you know where you're going.

1213
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:38,708
Anything else?

1214
01:52:44,583 --> 01:52:45,875
Hold on a sec.

1215
01:53:34,583 --> 01:53:35,875
Seal this up, please.

1216
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,666
I'm going to Mexico City in about a month.

1217
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:45,750
I'll mail it from there.

1218
01:53:46,833 --> 01:53:49,125
Anyone else you wanna say goodbye to?

1219
01:53:51,708 --> 01:53:54,458
Not many of us
get a chance to start fresh.

1220
01:53:55,916 --> 01:53:57,916
Good luck, Mr. Driscoll.

1221
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:55,041
I was thinking about that thing
you said about the universe.

1222
01:54:56,875 --> 01:54:58,875
Going where the universe takes you?

1223
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:00,875
Right on.

1224
01:55:01,875 --> 01:55:03,666
I think it's a cool philosophy.

1225
01:55:05,291 --> 01:55:08,000
I was being metaphorical.
It's a terrible philosophy.

1226
01:55:12,916 --> 01:55:15,541
I've gone where the universe takes me
my whole life.

1227
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:20,625
It's better to make those decisions
for yourself.
