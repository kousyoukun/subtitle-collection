You can go back to school.

You're married.

There'll be no baby born

995
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:45,402
We even waxed the floors.

996
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,905
I still don't understand
why you're so angry about that.

997
01:03:47,973 --> 01:03:49,907
Of course we wanted
to present a clean house.

998
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:51,943
It was stolen from us, Rose.

999
01:03:55,914 --> 01:03:58,616
You know why there are so few
young men at camp amache?

1000
01:03:58,684 --> 01:04:00,952
Why?

1001
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,188
They were drafted.

1002
01:04:04,256 --> 01:04:07,525
The 442nd regiment
fighting in France.

1003
01:04:07,592 --> 01:04:08,726
Enough!

1004
01:04:10,162 --> 01:04:12,030
And Rose is like
our parents.

1005
01:04:12,097 --> 01:04:15,933
Always proper,
always good.

1006
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:30,081
Florence:
Thank you, Livy.

1007
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:31,382
Livy:
Thank you so much.

1008
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:33,918
Thank you.

1009
01:04:33,986 --> 01:04:36,020
You're welcome.

1010
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:42,660
Livy...

1011
01:04:44,196 --> 01:04:45,462
I've met someone.

1012
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,965
Florence!

1013
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:49,500
We met on one
of the farms...

1014
01:04:49,568 --> 01:04:54,538
He was guarding the German POWs
working there.

1015
01:04:54,606 --> 01:04:56,708
He gave me this.

1016
01:04:56,775 --> 01:04:58,710
Oh...

1017
01:04:58,777 --> 01:05:00,444
It belonged to his mother.

1018
01:05:02,447 --> 01:05:04,381
You must be very special to him.

1019
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:07,418
He tells me I am.

1020
01:05:07,485 --> 01:05:09,087
Florie, we have to get back.

1021
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:13,925
Rose is just jealous.

1022
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:17,294
Um, but I want you to meet him.

1023
01:05:17,362 --> 01:05:18,429
Will you?

1024
01:05:18,496 --> 01:05:19,897
Of course I will.

1025
01:05:19,965 --> 01:05:22,433
Good. Thank you.

1026
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,735
What's his name?

1027
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:26,537
Walter.

1028
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:27,571
Bye, Livy.

1029
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:28,639
Bye.

1030
01:05:30,342 --> 01:05:31,675
Bye, Rose.
Bye, Livy.

1031
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:34,378
Thank you. Bye.

1032
01:05:34,446 --> 01:05:37,215
Why on earth did you
bring him up?

1033
01:05:51,096 --> 01:05:52,663
No! No!

1034
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:53,731
What? What-what's wrong?

1035
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:55,032
My artifacts
from the dugout.

1036
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,067
What are you doing?!

1037
01:05:56,135 --> 01:05:57,368
I was just cleaning
out the shed.

1038
01:05:57,435 --> 01:05:58,903
Where is the burlap bag?

1039
01:05:58,971 --> 01:06:00,171
What did you do with it!

1040
01:06:05,944 --> 01:06:07,645
Livy.

1041
01:06:31,736 --> 01:06:33,271
It was near the bottom
of the pile.

1042
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,811
It hadn't caught fire.

1043
01:06:47,019 --> 01:06:48,886
Livy, this is
a working farm.

1044
01:06:48,954 --> 01:06:51,789
If something doesn't have a use,
I throw it out.

1045
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,526
I thought it was trash.

1046
01:06:55,593 --> 01:06:58,395
It's not trash, it's history.

1047

It's <i>your</i> history.

1048

I'd do anything...

1049

I'd do anything
to make you happy.

1050

1051
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:16,613
I know that.

Higher, there...
Wait, um...

1057
01:09:04,322 --> 01:09:07,258
I'm not sure why we're putting
an old ox yoke inside the house.

1058
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:10,127
It was probably that very yoke
your grandfather used

1059
01:09:10,195 --> 01:09:11,662
To first break this land.

1060
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:15,532
Yeah, well, it's about
to break my back.

1061
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:22,439
I want to show you
the family history

1062
01:09:22,507 --> 01:09:24,408
That means the most to me.

1063
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,551
I let him talk me into a deal.

1064
01:09:36,988 --> 01:09:42,159
If I'd stay behind
and work the farm,

1065
01:09:42,227 --> 01:09:43,694
He'd join the navy.

1066

Landlocked his
whole growing up,

1067

He was always dreaming

I was the oldest.

1069
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:10,287
I should have gone.

is ring-ring-ring.

All right,

If you hear only ring,
that's Miss Paulson.

1074

Ring-ring is the Mcgregors.

Ring-ring-ring,

It's just for tonight.

1096
01:13:06,764 --> 01:13:07,964
I grew up here.

I ate at this table.

1098
01:13:09,534 --> 01:13:11,135
For all my growing up,

1099
01:13:11,202 --> 01:13:12,869
My mama never let a dog
in the house,

1100
01:13:12,937 --> 01:13:13,937
And I won't either.

I'm guessing he didn't
know you were married, huh?

1105

I'm taking the night shift
at the beet factory.

1106

It's something I sometimes
do this time of year.

I did not realize what
an insult that would be to you.

I want to tell you.

My first day here,

I looked in your dresser.

1123

I can't even
explain why I did it.

I'm sorry.

You could've looked in there
anytime you wanted.

hear it ticking.

you carry it.

he was to my mama.

I was wondering if you wanted
to have this dress.

1157
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:39,869
As big as
I am now,

1158
01:17:39,937 --> 01:17:41,738
I can't imagine ever
fitting into it again.

1159
01:17:41,805 --> 01:17:44,107
The hat comes with it.

1160
01:17:44,175 --> 01:17:46,343
Can I try it?

1161
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,777
Go on.

1162
01:17:57,522 --> 01:17:58,455
Did Ray tell you...

1163
01:17:58,523 --> 01:17:59,822
I don't know the details.

1164
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:02,259
He and hank had to go over

1165
01:18:02,326 --> 01:18:03,460
To the beet factory.

1166
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:09,432
Why don't you come in
and sit down?

1167
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,835
For months I've...

1168
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:15,104
I've written the father
of this baby.

1169
01:18:15,173 --> 01:18:17,874
I thought he died.

1170
01:18:17,941 --> 01:18:19,409
I didn't realize...

1171
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:22,312
No. He... He's a
flight instructor.

1172
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,147
He never
went overseas.

1173
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:25,515
We met
on furlough.

1174
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:31,521
And for months, I've...
Written him these letters.

1175
01:18:31,589 --> 01:18:33,723
I know it was wrong.

1176
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:36,660
For the longest time,
I didn't hear from him.

1177
01:18:36,727 --> 01:18:38,928
And as long as I
didn't hear from him,

1178
01:18:38,996 --> 01:18:41,998
I could imagine
that he wanted me.

1179
01:18:42,066 --> 01:18:45,702
I finally
got a letter.

1180
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:48,905
"Congratulations, Livy.

1181
01:18:48,972 --> 01:18:51,774
"You're a wonderful girl.

1182
01:18:51,842 --> 01:18:55,044
"And I only hope you find
the father of this baby,

1183
01:18:55,112 --> 01:18:58,315
Because I sincerely doubt
that I'm responsible."

1184
01:19:04,088 --> 01:19:06,256
I know that I've hurt Ray.

1185
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,225
My sister wants me

1186
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:10,993
To go back to Denver
to have the baby.

1187
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:16,032
Might be best if I leave
after Thanksgiving.

1188
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:28,745
When Ray loves a person,
it's with his whole heart.

1189
01:19:31,014 --> 01:19:35,084
Losing our baby brother
to the war nearly killed him.

1190
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:40,056
If you're planning on leaving,
do it soon.

1191
01:19:50,401 --> 01:19:51,501
You know, there's one thing

1192
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:54,771
I've never
heard you say.

1193
01:19:54,838 --> 01:19:57,407
And that's how
you feel about Ray.

Calling out.

Calling out
for your mama.

1202
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:37,146
After mama died,

1203
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:41,017
I was so lonely.

1204
01:20:41,084 --> 01:20:45,689
I gave my life away,
just to be held.

1205
01:20:45,756 --> 01:20:47,990
By a stranger.

1206

How could I do that?

1207
01:21:03,207 --> 01:21:05,174
Ray...

1208
01:21:05,242 --> 01:21:09,713
You are such a good...

1209
01:21:17,755 --> 01:21:21,558
Thank you. Thank you.

Livy:
<i>Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

Oh, it was so kind of you
to bake us a pie, Livy.

1212
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,700
Happy Thanksgiving.

Livy tells me
you're from California.

Yes, we are.

I've never been
to California.

Livy, can we talk?

I've never been
to Colorado.

you can meet my boyfriend

Sure.

Perhaps, uh,

1222
01:21:46,851 --> 01:21:48,317
We could go for a drive

1223

Just to get away from here

1224

For the afternoon.

I'll pick you up here.

Thank you, Livy.

I'm grateful for
all of you, of course,

But I'd also like to pray that
this war will soon be over.

with this family

I have received love here.
