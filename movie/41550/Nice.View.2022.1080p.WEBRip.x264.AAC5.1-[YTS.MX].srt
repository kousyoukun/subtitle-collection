SHENZHEN, 2013

4
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:52,958
{\an8}It's time to get up.

5
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,916
{\an8}Wake up.

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,625
{\an8}Is it too tight?

7
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,416
{\an8}It's all right.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,416
{\an8}MORNING, NOON, NIGHT

9
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,625
{\an8}Easy.

10
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,500
{\an8}Jing Hao?

11
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,333
{\an8}The television is out again.

12
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,541
{\an8}I'll take a look tonight.

13
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,541
{\an8}Before 6 p.m., all right?

14
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,458
{\an8}All right!

15
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,875
Good morning, miss.

16
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,083
Good morning.

17
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,583
- You're here.
- Good morning.

18
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,625
- Good morning, Ms. Zhang.
- Good morning.

19
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,625
- Bye.
- Don't forget your pills.

20
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,583
- Bye.
- Bye.

21
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,208
- Good morning, Mr. Sun!
- Hello.

22
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,041
<i>The test results look promising for now.</i>

23
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,708
Continue with the same prescription.

24
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,000
The cough you talked about...

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,375
I don't think that's to do with the CHD.

26
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,958
But my mom coughed all the time
when she was alive too.

27
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,916
Her case was quite different
from your sister's.

28
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,041
Despite being hereditary,

29
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,291
the symptoms can vary considerably.

30
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,166
But her breath runs short
every time it rains. Is that normal?

31
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,291
She's too young

32
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,291
for her cardiorespiratory system
to be fully developed.

33
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,875
Also, with her congenital heart disease,

34
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,291
it's normal to get short of breath
when air pressure is low.

35
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,500
Don't worry.

36
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
- But sometimes after intense exercise--
- She's six now?

37
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Yes.

38
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,750
Better complete the operation
before turning eight,

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,916
like I've told you a dozen times.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,416
Despite exhibiting
very limited symptoms now,

41
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,208
the situation will worsen
once she's past eight.

42
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,833
It will get even more complicated

43
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,333
if you keep putting it off.

44
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,125
You'd better get the operation money fast.

45
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,250
You're late.

46
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,291
- You're early.
- Be careful.

50
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,333
That one is fixed.

51
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,458
{\an8}These two are goners.

52
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,166
{\an8}Too old to find matching parts.

53
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,166
Not even Mr. Jing could help?

54
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,333
I'll just burn it then.

55
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,708

{\an8}This is Greek!

{\an8}An iPhone is an iPhone.

59
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,041
{\an8}Will my employees be able to understand?

60
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,833
{\an8}Phone me anytime if they have problems.

61
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,375
{\an8}If that fails, I could always
just go there and show them myself.

62
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,000
That's my man! How much is it?

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,083
It's 1,860.

64
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,750
How about 1,800? A nice, round number.

65
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,916
Why not 1,900 then?

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,708
It's also a nice, round number.

67
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,458
Refurbishing is a tough business
these days.

68
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,250
And I'm cozy with my business?

69
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,541
So you don't want it?

70
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,291
{\an8}I didn't say that.

71
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,250
{\an8}Little rascal.

72
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,250
{\an8}You're greedy as a hyena.

73
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:14,916
Bye.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,083
See you next month.

76
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,458
Is it done?

77
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,166
Almost there, Mr. Zhong,

78
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,583
once you stop banging on it.

79
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,083
This is taking too long.

80
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,583
I'm already late for the show.

81
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,625
{\an8}It's 30, same as always.

82
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,541
{\an8}Thank you, Mr. Liang.

83
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,291
This is

84
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,000
from my wife.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,416
She brought it from her hometown.

86
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,416
A thank-you gift
for fixing me with the gig.

87
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,416
- But that didn't work out.
- Go away.

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,833
That wasn't your fault.

89
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,083
I went up there

90
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,416
and my legs shook so hard,

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,041
let alone cleaning windows
while hanging on a harness.

92
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,541
No wonder the pay was good.

93
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,458
I'll find other gigs.

94
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,458
Safety first.

95
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,416
Mr. Liang,
just get a new television already.

96
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,333
Even I can't help if it breaks down again.

97
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,916
- The boss is a cheapskate--
- Mr. Liang.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,750
302 wet himself again.

99
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,958
I'm on my way.

100
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,166
Take it. Cook for Tongtong.

101
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,250
It's good for the heart.

102
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,166
Hurry.

103
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,833
I'm coming.

104
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,875

106
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,958
What?

107
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,000
Your tooth fell off?

108
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,458
Where did it go?

109
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:48,791
You swallowed it?

110
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,125
Did it hurt?

111
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,208
Go and rinse your mouth.

112
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,875
Don't lick it.

113
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,166
Or the next one becomes a bucktooth.

114
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,791
Stop licking!

00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,208
I'm home.

118
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,791
You're not working
at the gas station tonight?

119
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,458
They don't offer part-time jobs anymore.

120
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,291
What about the surgery money?

121
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,208
It's almost half a million.
It's not easy to scrounge up.

122
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,791
You still owe me.

123
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,500
It's only 2,000.

124
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,375
"Only"?

125
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,833
You said your mom was sick.
Or I wouldn't have lent you.

126
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,833
Your dad didn't leave you any
before he left?

127
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,041
He ditched us.
We're grateful enough that he had no debt.

128
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,125
Where are you taking me?

129
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,791
Here. Here we are.

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,958
My buddy is here.

133
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,625
I'll show him around.

134
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,625
Give me a hand.

135
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,541
What do you think? Second-hand Shennings.
100,000 and you can take them home.

136
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,166
What are you saying?

137
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,166
Where are they from?

138
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,666
Some import-export guy left it.

139
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,791
He went to jail

140
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,333
while he owed us two years of rent.

141
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,416
The boss said to free some space,
so we're dumping them all.

142
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,333
Still, these are worth way more.

143
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,083
- Faulty?
- Yes.

00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,333
Rejects from Italy.

145
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,625
They said the whole batch was faulty.

146
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,166
We'll sell it as junk
if you don't want it.

147
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,083
We've even made an offer.

148
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,041
For how much?

149
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,083
It's 80,000.

150
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,250
And you ask me for 100,000?

151
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,750
The price was set by the manager.
I have zero control.

152
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,708
Plus,

153
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,750
you have to let them

154
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,166
make some money.

155
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,125
Is there a quality report?

156
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,333
Yes.

157
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,583

how about you return my 2,000?

166
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,416
The huge deal I hooked you up with
is not enough?

00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,583
Trade old phones for new ones
at a high price.

HUAQIANG ELECTRONIC WORLD

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,916
Excuse me.

185
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,083
Excuse me.

186
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,333
{\an8}You are doing refurbishment now?

187
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,250
Between you and me,

188
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,791
how did you come by so many Shennings?

189
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,041
Trade secret.

190
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,291
{\an8}Half of the market
must be purchasing from you, right?

191
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,458
{\an8}Cut the crap.

192
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,583
Do you want it or not?

193
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,000
I do. What am I, stupid?

194
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,125
Jeez.

195
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,875
Damn. Over 900,000.

196
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,083
You're making a fortune.

197
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,208
Fine, forget about your source.

198
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,916
At least tell me
how much you got them for.

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,291
Is it 500,000?

200
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,416
Is it 400,000?

201
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,250
Can it be 300,000, Mr. Jing?

202
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,083
{\an8}Why should I tell you?
Because you let me use your calculator?

203
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,000
Bye, Mr. Li.

204
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,625
Mr. Jing! Take care!

205
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,958
Go make a killing!

206
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,541
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Tongtong.

207
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,916
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

208
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,750
What's with you?

209
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,958
Just excited.

210
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,208
What for?

211
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,416
I just found a gold mine.

212
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,166
What gold mine?

213
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,041
I'll show you this weekend.

214
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,791
What do you want for dinner?

215
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,041
Not black fungus.

216
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,416
No black fungus?

217
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,250
Beef noodles then?

218
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,416
No.

219
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,208
Brisket noodles?

220
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,708
No.

221
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,416
Enoki mushroom noodles?

222
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:13,750
No.

223
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,250
Milk custard

224
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,291
noodles?

225
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,875
TWO WEEKS LATER

226
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,833
<i>Recently, local authorities have started</i>

227
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,125
<i>a formal campaign</i>

228
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,916
<i>against refurbished and knock-off phones
in Huaqiang North.</i>

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,333
<i>Progress has been made.</i>

230
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>The local commerce department
seized large numbers of refurbished</i>

231
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,625
<i>and knock-off cell phones
suspected of piracy and fraud.</i>

232
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,208
What the hell?

233
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,916
You delayed for a month
and now you don't want it?

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,166
Are you ganging up on me?

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,875
Are you blind?

236
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,708
Refurbishing is officially illegal now.

237
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,500
Two dealers got arrested yesterday.

238
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,583
Do you want that too?

239
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,708
But you signed this.

240
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,375
It's just a confirmation of intention.

241
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,083
Even if it's a contract,

242
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,333
it will be illegal now.

243
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,583
You can't hold me to it.

244
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,416
So my inventory's all bust?

245
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,333
You are losing money?

246
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,250
We all have a bunch of phones
that are collecting dust.

247
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,500
Haozi,

248
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,750
this is business.

249
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,916
Penny-wise, pound-foolish.

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,333
Just accept it.

251
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,416
Accept it, my ass.

252
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,791
Young man,

253
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,625
you are not giving up yet?

254
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,583
Keep them for another month.

255
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,416
You said a couple of days
and you'll take them out.

256
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,708
I need more time.

257
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,583

ZHAO ZHENCHANG,
THE FUTURE OF SHENNING

261
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,458
Yes?

262
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,791
All right.

263
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,875
Sir?

264
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,333
He'll see you now.

265
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,291
This way.

266
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,208
Okay.

267
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,125
<i>I told you, we don't buy back phones.</i>

268
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,916
{\an8}I'm not asking you to do that, Mr. Li.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,791
{\an8}Just buy the parts I salvaged.

270
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,250
{\an8}And what would I do with those?

271
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,916
{\an8}For secondary products,
like certified refurbished phones,

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,875
{\an8}you can make a whole industry chain.

273
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,083
{\an8}I looked it up, there's a huge market
based on overseas reports.

274
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,291
{\an8}And I should do what they do?

275
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,750
{\an8}We don't have people
to salvage phone parts.

276
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,833
{\an8}That's not a problem.

277
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,916
{\an8}I can do the salvaging.

278
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,541
{\an8}There's also quality control,
which you won't pass.

279
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,791
I can.

280
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,458
I promise.

281
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,291
On what?

282
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,791
You're just a repair guy.

283
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,208
I wouldn't even agree to see you
if it weren't for your daily pestering.

284
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,125
Mr. Li,

285
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,708
I don't think what I do is relevant.

286
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,750
Can I take it that if I pass
quality control, you'll take my parts?

287
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,875
You won't.

288
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,083
I will.

289
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,958
Okay. Just let me pass.

290
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,000
Gosh, that's complicated.

291
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,125
Sure it is.

292
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,583
Dismantling it isn't enough.

293
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,625
I'll have to ensure
they pass quality control as well,

294
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,500
which requires my parts
to be in good condition.

295
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,208
Screens, motherboards,
CPUs, memory boards, and cameras

296
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,666
are just the larger parts.

297
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,041
There are still many smaller parts.

298
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,583
Goodness... This...

299
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,375
Are all these phones on you? Alone?

300
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,666
Not a chance.

301
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,958
{\an8}This is the dismantling manual
for the 4S model.

302
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,500
{\an8}Once I finish the manual for C8,

303
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,708
{\an8}I'll hire a bunch of people,

304
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,208
{\an8}then they can do it for me.

305
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,125
{\an8}My friend,

306
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,666
{\an8}you're a damn scientist.

307
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,250
{\an8}No, not really.

308
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,041
{\an8}All it takes
is meticulousness and patience.

309
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,250
{\an8}You could do it too.

310
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,583
Stop that!

311
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,291
With my elementary education?
I can't even break chicken bones properly.

312
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,666
So what if you have little education?

313
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,875
Don't let your past define you.

314
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,625
{\an8}Show some confidence, buddy.

315
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,833
{\an8}All right!

316
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,125
Don't call me buddy.

317
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,625
I'm not here for this,

318
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,666
not for your inspirational crap.

319
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,375
I'm here for my money.

320
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,666
When are you going to pay me back?

321
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,833
I'm telling you,
had I carried a weapon today, I would--

322
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,750
Either you kill me right now

323
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,791
or you give me one more week.

324
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,250
By then, I'll be finished with these,

325
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,041
pass quality control, and get my advance.

326
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll definitely pay you back.

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,083
One week.

328
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,208
Okay.

329
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,625
There's no need to get worked up.

330
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,708
But if you don't have the money by then,

331
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,791
I'll just take everything in here

332
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,666
and you can kiss
your little business goodbye.

333
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,125
No problem.

334
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,291
Little guy,
you've got some knack for business.

335
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,958
It's just that sometimes,

336
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,666
you get a bit too aggressive.

337
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:08,833

358
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,750
- Here's the report.
- Why are you here again?

359
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,208
- To seal our deal.
- What's wrong with you?

360
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,083
You said you'll take my parts
if they pass the tests.

361
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,541
- No, I didn't.
- You said it last time!

362
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,625
Stop harassing me.

363
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,166
I'm not harassing anyone.

364
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,541
What are you, retarded?

365
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,583
You're too young for this.

366
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,708
Leave.

367
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,375
What has my age to do with this?

368
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,250
- Hello, Mr. Zhao.
- Mr. Zhao.

369
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,250
What kind of scheme is that?

370
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,208
If we have to cut the price
to combat refurbishing,

371
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,083
- what do I need marketing for?
- Yes.

372
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,666
Stop saying that.

373
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,500
I need a new scheme in five days.

374
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,750
- Yes.
- Hi, Mr. Zhao.

375
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,541
I'd like to make a proposal
for a spare parts recollection chain.

376
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,958
There's a huge market for it.

377
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,000
It's on the rise overseas.

378
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,708
You could be the pioneer in China.

379
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,875
Think about it.
The prospects are highly promising.

380
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,750
To combat refurbishing, it's better
if you could cut off the source.

381
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,375
Recycled parts
can make secondary products.

382
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,958
It will be a seller.

383
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,500
Mr. Zhao, just give me ten minutes.

384
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,458
- That's all I need.
- I don't have ten minutes for you.

385
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,250
I'm catching the 3 p.m. train.

386
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,666
I'll be back in a month.

387
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,791
Please drive.

388
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,083
2:21 P.M., MAY 3RD, FRIDAY

389
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,458
Where is he going?

390
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,500
Who the hell are you?

391
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,541
Why should I tell you?

392
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,375
Tell me!

393
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What do you want?

394
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,625
- Hi, please help me--
- Excuse me.

395
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,791
Sorry. I'm catching the 3 p.m. train.

396
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,791
How much for one stop
of the D378 train to Wenzhou?

397
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,291
It leaves in 30 minutes.
You won't make it.

398
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,416
That's none of your business.
How much is it?

399
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,583
It's 52 yuan.

400
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:02,875
Why did you park here?

401
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,375
Are you trying to get us killed?

402
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,875
I'm so sorry.

403
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,708
2:45 P.M.

404
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,625
Excuse me.

405
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,000
There'll be a conference call
in half an hour.

406
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:41,875
Get ready.

407
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,500
Mr. Zhao.

408
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,916
<i>Please check your ticket carefully
and sit accordingly.</i>

409
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,750
<i>The next station is Shanwei Station.</i>

410
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,958
- Do you have that ten minutes now? <i>- Pay attention to the announcements</i>

411
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,250
<i>and get ready to alight.</i>

412
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,083
<i>I see.</i>

413
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:13,916
Did you plan on selling the parts back
from the beginning?

414
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,583
No.

415
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,541
You wanted to make a fortune
out of refurbished phones,

416
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,083
but with the new law,

417
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,875
you weren't able to sell any, were you?

418
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:23,833
That's right.

419
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,083
I thought so.

420
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,375
Why do you think what you have here

421
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,875
is worth my time?

422
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,125
But if it works,

423
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,250
you can make it into an industry chain.

424
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,166
- It's very promising.
- It's not that simple.

425
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,625
Do you quit whenever things get hard?

426
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,000
No one has done this in China.

427
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,791
That's why you're not going to try it?

428
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,416
What are you, their subsidiary?

429
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,500
What's your name?

430
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,166
Jing Hao.

431
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,625
How old are you?

432
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,583
I am 20.

433
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,541
Such a big ambition for such a young boy.

434
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,666
But you should already give it up.

435
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,916
Why?

436
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,291
Leaving aside the plausibility
of the industry chain,

437
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,541
you wouldn't even be able
to retrieve all the parts

438
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,083
and keep them intact.

439
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,500
What if I could?

440
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,458
Do you promise to take them?

441
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,291
I would take them if you could do it.

442
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,875
- Thank you, Mr. Zhao.
- One more thing.

443
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,291
No advances.

444
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,250
Take care of the dismantling yourself.

445
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,125
I'm not providing plants
or workers either.

446
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,125
If the parts fail quality control,

447
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,000
you won't get a dime.

448
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:22,583
Business card.

449
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,750
Contact him if you are ready.

450
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,708
LI PING, SOUTH CHINA CONSUMER BUSINESS
OPERATIONS MANAGER

451
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,541
<i>He reached out to you before?</i>

452
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,875
Yes, several times.

453
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,708
Interesting.

454
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,833
How old were you
when you came to Shenzhen?

455
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,583
Right after getting my master's degree.

456
00:27:58,666 --> 00:27:59,791
I was 25.

457
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,375
I was about his age

458
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,833
when I first came here.

459
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:07,250
In a blink, a fishing village
turned into a concrete jungle.

460
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,333
Everything is possible in this place.

461
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,208
Yes.

462
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,208
Stop with all the yeses.

463
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,000
Might as well get your scheme right.

464
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,916
Yes.

465
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,208
Here.

466
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,166
Sorry, I'm late.

467
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,291
It's okay.

468
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,916
Sorry if I held you up.

469
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,166
I live here anyway.

470
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,541
It's okay.

471
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,291
I'm so sorry.

472
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,000
Say goodbye.

473
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,166
Bye, Mr. Sun.

474
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,500
See you.

475
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,333
Where's your scooter?

476
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,291
It's broken.

477
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,208
I sent it in for repairs.

478
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,125
Does it hurt?

479
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:36,500
Not really.

480
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,166
Come on.

481
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,500
Don't go that fast.

482
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,958
It's dangerous.

483
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:48,750
I know.

484
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,625
Let's go home.

485
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,458
Come on.

486
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,250
No, let's go to the hospital.

487
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,166
Is that necessary?

488
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,541
The pharmacy then.

489
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,750
Okay.

490
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,541
{\an8}IODOPHOR DISINFECTANT

491
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,166
PERMITTED WORKS: HIGH LEVEL CLEANING,
MAINTENANCE, INSTALLATION, DISASSEMBLY

492
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,916
<i>It will cost me a lot
to build the factory.</i>

493
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,375
I think I might find a daytime job

494
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,000
to get some money to run the factory.

495
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,666
But I'll need someone I can trust
to oversee production.

496
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,708
Also, you are looking for a job...

497
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,708
I can offer much more than elsewhere.

498
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,500
It's not about the money.

499
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,583
What you are doing

500
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,333
is way too risky.

501
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,083
By chance this doesn't work out,

502
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,708
you could lose all your money

503
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,291
and then some.

504
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,250
Your whole life is over.

505
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,583
Forget it.

506
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,416
Safety first.

507
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,000
Come on, Mr. Li,

508
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,500
have a little more patience.

509
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,416
All right.

510
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,541
Mr. Liang,

511
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,416
Tongtong is six and a half years old.

512
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,000
She has to have the surgery by eight.

513
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:13,875
The operation,

514
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,708
hospitalization, medicine, nursing...

515
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,041
All that cost around 300,000

516
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,333
to 500,000.

517
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,833
Do you think I can make that kind of money
by running my little dealership?

518
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,583
We've had an agreement.

519
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,541
If the yield is over 85%,

520
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,041
I'll be able to make 800,000
in four months.

521
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,291
I have to do it

522
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,375
and I have to make it.

523
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,208
I don't have a choice, Mr. Liang.

524
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,541
Are you sure about this?

525
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:51,833
Yes.

526
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:53,750
Okay then.

527
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,875
I'll switch shifts with my wife.

528
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,750
During the day,
I'll be overseeing your place.

529
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,791
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

530
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,750
{\an8}Think twice before you sign it.

531
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,000
I've seen so many wage earners like you

532
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,791
with your delusions
of getting rich overnight

533
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,250
end up with nothing.

534
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,833
You'd better be practical,

535
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,041
quit dreaming about what's not--

536
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,625
{\an8}You're a wage earner too.

537
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,791
Like I said, you've got some ideas.

538
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,083
You didn't budge
when you refused to pay back.

539
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,500
You have some guts.

543
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,500
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

544
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,458
You already own a factory
and you want to be a window cleaner?

545
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,916
I need the money, buddy.

546
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,958
I'm not your buddy.

547
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,958
One man in my squad fell dead
and you all disappeared.

548
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,500
I had to hold out for half a year alone.
Now I'm your buddy?

549
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,041
I'm sorry, but I need money for my sister.

550
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,625
I didn't join any other squad, did I?

551
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:45,541
I changed careers.

552
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,125
So you didn't do this for two years?

553
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,166
One day, that's all I need
to get the hang of it again.

554
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,500
You know what I was like.

555
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,833
We're full.

556
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,583
What?

557
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,250
Buddy,

558
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,125
this is the only job
that pays enough for my factory.

559
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,833
Please?

560
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,791
Hands off.

561
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,875
Do you still have your license?

562
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,625
Yes!

563
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,666
There's no base pay.

564
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,916
Wait for my call.

565
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,333
Thank you, Ma Yue!

566
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:28,041
It's 3,000 for storage and rent,

567
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,625
not including utility.

568
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,583
{\an8}Any chance you might do a little better?

569
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,750
How about 2,500?

570
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,916
No.

571
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Two thousand?

572
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,125
The place is ancient.

573
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,833
How about 2,510?

574
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:43,750
No way.

575
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,958
How about 2,520?

576
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:47,958
It's 3,000. Period.

577
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,500
If you don't want it, tons of people do.

578
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,958
Three thousand will do.

579
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,791
But I get all the junk here.

580
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,291
It's 2,600.

581
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,416
How about 2,600?

582
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,583
WORK AREA

583
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,083

00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,791
COMPLETION CHART

585
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,541
A JOB WELL COMPLETED!

586
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,083
LOVING NURSING HOME

587
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,208
A saying came to mind.

588
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,541
"It always seems impossible
until it's done."

589
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,750
All we need is someone to do it.

590
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,958
Come on, people, follow me!

591
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,875
Now, the registration forms I gave you,

592
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,791
fill them in, and give them back.

593
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,583
Also, your ID cards.

594
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,500
You have to keep them secure.

595
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,416
Otherwise, there will be no job for you.

596
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Keep up!

597
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,958
Stop following me.

598
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,458
It's 1,000 a month,

599
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,458
who would want that?

600
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,208
- Stop following me. Keep up!
- No, not 1,000.

601
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,166
- Keep up!
- No.

602
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,375
After it's all done,

603
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:14,291
- we offer 2% commission.
- Left. To the left.

604
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,708
Almost 5,000 a month.

605
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,500
And people have to wait
until it's all done?

606
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,333
No one would do it,
except for those who can't find work.

607
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,958
How many of these people are there?

608
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,041
Ten, at most.

609
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,375
- That will do.
- That will do.

610
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,583
<i>That one is Wang Chunmei.</i>

611
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,500
- One. <i>- A single mom.</i>

612
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,208
<i>- Used to work at an electronics factory.</i>
- One.

613
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,708
- One. <i>- Now she does all kinds of gigs.</i>

614
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,333
- <i>Low pay, short-term.</i>
- I'm sorry.

615
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,083
<i>- What happened to her old job?</i>
- I'm sorry.

616
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,833
<i>Hearing loss.
Too much noise in that factory.</i>

617
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,333
<i>Long exposure damaged her hearing.</i>

618
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,666
- Rice? <i>- Then she got fired.</i>

619
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,291
- Chopsticks. <i>- Still pending lawsuit.</i>

620
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,291
Wang Chunmei?

621
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,708
Wang Chunmei!

622
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,333
Take their order!

623
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,458
Take our order.

624
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,625
What would you like?

625
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:54,875
You startled me.

626
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,833
<i>Here.</i>

627
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:59,416
{\an8}- Point the air gun here.
- Right, here.

628
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,833
- Preheat it first--
- Preheat it?

629
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:03,916
- Yes.
- And?

630
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,416
Soldering paste.

631
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,125
{\an8}You have to put
some soldering paste there.

632
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,291
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,625
I have to make you yell all the time.

634
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:14,125
The hearing aids
that my son got me will arrive soon.

635
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,833
{\an8}In a few days, you won't have to.

636
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,166
{\an8}It's okay. I'm fine.

637
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,250
{\an8}I'm okay.

638
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:19,916
{\an8}Continue.

639
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,083
<i>He is Zhang Longhao.</i>

640
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,083
{\an8}<i>The manager at his old place
once went physical on someone.</i>

641
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,375
{\an8}<i>He stood up for the guy,
but thanks to his combat training,</i>

642
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,541
<i>he injured the supervisor badly
and did a few years' time.</i>

643
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,166
{\an8}<i>Who'd want to hire an ex-con?</i>

644
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,000
{\an8}<i>He could only do a few gigs at home.</i>

645
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,250
{\an8}<i>This guy is a bit weird.</i>

646
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,791
{\an8}<i>He doesn't engage with people much,</i>

647
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,416
{\an8}<i>but he keeps several stray dogs.</i>

648
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,875
{\an8}<i>Are you sure about him?</i>

649
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,791
What do you want?

650
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,083
I've told you several times.

651
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,208
The air gun must be preheated
to 350 degrees Celsius,

652
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,375
heat it evenly for three minutes.

653
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,750
{\an8}Also, take out the boards by the corners.

654
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,125
{\an8}The way you do it will break them.

655
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,458
I'm so sorry.

656
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,750
I'll do it right.

657
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,416
It's okay.

658
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,750
I went a little bit far.

659
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,916
Let's try again.

660
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,375
- It's 350 degrees Celsius.
- It's 350 degrees Celsius.

661
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,708
- By the corners.
- By the corners.

662
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,125
Come on.

663
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,541
<i>These are called "cybercafe dwellers."</i>

664
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,458
<i>They live in cybercafes.</i>

665
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:18,666
<i>They want nothing</i>

666
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,958
<i>but to play games and get by,
let alone work.</i>

667
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,000
<i>Most of them already sold their ID cards,
living on no more than five yuan a day.</i>

668
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,916
Why does this one want a job?

669
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,333
{\an8}- He got a girl, a local one.
- Save it for me.

670
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,666
{\an8}Crazy enough to want to marry him.

671
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,250
{\an8}So he now wants an actual job.

672
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,041
{\an8}- Mr. Han.
- Greet your boss.

673
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,083
{\an8}Sir.

674
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,083
{\an8}This one.

675
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,375
{\an8}Hello, sir.

676
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,750
I'll introduce myself.

677
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,958
I'm Liu Hengzhi.

678
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,875
I can stay up real late.

679
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,625
I'm currently holding the record
in this cybercafe

680
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,458
for the longest all-nighters in a row.

681
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,666
Sixteen weeks.

682
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Do you still need more workers?

683
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,291
I persuaded my best friend to join me.

684
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:57,916
Sure.

685
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,625
Zhang Chao?

686
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:02,958
Wind Chaser?

687
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,583
Turn to the next page.

688
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,500
Sir?

689
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,041
On page 22,

690
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,583
there's no solder point on subboard lines,

691
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,125
so what's the point of an air gun?

692
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,291
We're not heating the points,

693
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,500
but the adhesive on the back.

694
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,166
Don't set the temperature too high
or you'll burn the subboard.

695
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,833
Why aren't you listening?

696
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,083
I am, with my eyes closed.

697
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,583
- Well...
- Where was I?

698
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,083
Don't burn the subboard.

699
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,708
We need to burn the subboard.

700
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,541
Fool...

701
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,583
Wake up.

702
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,666
This is not that easy.

703
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,833
What?

704
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,250
I don't sleep.

705
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,000
You were snoring.

706
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,833
<i>Zhong heard you were setting up a factory</i>

707
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,625
and decided to help you out.

708
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,000
They say they have something to offer,

709
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,041
but really,

710
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,750
they just have nothing to do anyway.

711
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,833
Will it do?

712
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,333
The four in the back

713
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,833
aren't able to dismantle phones,

714
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,416
so they want to be temporary workers.

715
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,625
Earn what you can spare, right?

716
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:04,708
Yes.

717
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,583
What about Mr. Zhong?

718
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,208
Do you know
what he used to do for a living?

719
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,291
{\an8}I spent half of my life
dealing with clockwork.

720
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,708
{\an8}Just look at this.
No one could do a finer job.

721
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,041
{\an8}A fine job, all right.

722
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,250
{\an8}But do you have to take out
every component?

723
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,666
{\an8}It's useless now.

724
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,541
{\an8}You could have told me sooner.

725
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,083
{\an8}I did. You just didn't hear me.

726
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,416
{\an8}All right.

727
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,458
{\an8}I'll put them back on then.

728
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:33,916
{\an8}<i>Ready?</i>

729
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,250
I'm taking the picture.

730
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
- Get in the center, sir.
- Go.

731
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,875
- Go.
- Come.

732
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,708
Three, two, one,

733
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,708
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

734
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:53,625
NICE VIEW
ELECTRONIC COMPONENT FACTORY

735
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:05,291
CLEANING TEAM

736
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,500
Thank you, doctor.

737
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:49,750
Let's go.

738
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,958
<i>Did he say I'm okay now?</i>

739
00:43:58,541 --> 00:43:59,791
He said you're getting better.

740
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,583
No then.

741
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,083
{\an8}You'll be okay.

742
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,291
Do you see that building?

743
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,541
It wasn't even there
when we first came to Shenzhen.

744
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,250
Now it's all big and tall.

745
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,875
You're still young
and can become big and tall,

746
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,125
right?

747
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,333
Tongtong.

748
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,083
Remember,

749
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,208
as long as we work hard,

750
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,125
nothing is impossible.

751
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,958
We're still a little behind schedule.

752
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,333
We're already faster than last month.

753
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,041
We should get faster and faster.

754
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,541
If that's the case, I'll do more tonight.

755
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,375
This is last month's rent.

756
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,708
For the utility bills,
could you please speak to Mr. Yang later?

757
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:49,666
I will ask Ma Yue for more work this month

758
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,000
and pay by the middle of the month.

759
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,916
Fine.

760
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,250
Who are you looking for?

761
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,708
Is that pile of cell phones outside yours?

762
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:02,583
Yours?

763
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:05,000
Mr. Li of Huaqiang North told me
to come over.

764
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,333
Let's talk about business.

765
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,541
I'll do my side and you do yours.
No one will know.

766
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,250
Think about it. It's promising.

767
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,916
You are too timid to make a fortune.

768
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,833
Forget about it. Just leave.

769
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:17,208
What is he up to?

770
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,125
To lure me
into some sort of electronic alchemy.

771
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,625
Electronic alchemy?

772
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:22,750
Soaking the electronic components
in some chemicals

773
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,416
to wash out precious metals.

774
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,000
It seems that it can make a lot of money.

775
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,500
It's not about money.

776
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
It is illegal.

777
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,291
Right.

778
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:32,416
Safety first.

779
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,625
Why did you deduct 100 yuan
from my salary?

780
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,291
You worked fewer hours
every day last month.

781
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,041
You missed five days of work
without telling me.

782
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,250
You should be thankful.

783
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,750
I had to help my alliance with dungeons.

784
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,625
You should have at least
given me a heads up.

785
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,708
I'll tell you next month.

786
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,291
{\an8}Then I'll give you the salary next month.

787
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:53,125
{\an8}What? You are not going to give me now?

788
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,541
It won't be fair to others.
How will I manage this factory?

789
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,750
Spare it,
don't put me off with your manager duties.

790
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,541
You're the factory manager, so what?
I'm the president.

791
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,416
All you got are a few containers
and broken tables.

792
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,583
Yet you call yourself a manager?

793
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,458
- Zhang Chao, that's enough.
- Why should I stop?

794
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,833
It's not fair!

795
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,666
This dump
doesn't even have air conditioning.

796
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,875
The cybercafe is better than this.

797
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:10,166
Are you done?

798
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,333
If you want to do it, do it well.

799
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,291
Or you can leave.

800
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:21,166
You'd better remember this.

801
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,416
I quit on my own initiative.

802
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,458
I'm not fired by you.

803
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:26,041
- Zhang Chao.
- Let go!

804
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,083
Zhang Chao!

805
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,708
Who cares?

806
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,041
Don't be mad, Boss.

807
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,750
He is out of his mind.

808
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,750
Never mind.

809
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,041
Let's get back to work.

810
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,208
Stop watching. Go back to work.

811
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,416
{\an8}Mr. Liang,

812
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:46,833
{\an8}this is for last month's utility bills.

813
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,375
{\an8}Give it to Mr. Yang when he comes.

814
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:50,041
{\an8}Do you still have money for yourself?

815
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,125
{\an8}I do.

816
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:03,791
I've set up a factory recently,

817
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,458
so I'm in a bit of a tight spot.

818
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,916
<i>Your business has nothing to do with me.</i>

819
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,125
<i>Tell me, how many times
have you delayed paying rent?</i>

820
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,791
Mr. Wang, please give me a few more days.

821
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,208
- I'll do my best-- <i>- Do your best?</i>

822
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,541
<i>You've been delaying for two months.</i>

823
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,375
<i>Tell me now,
when exactly will the rent be paid?</i>

824
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,041
Hello, Mr. Wang?

825
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,125
I can't hear you.

826
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,250
- My signal is poor. <i>- Haozi, don't play tricks with me.</i>

827
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,583
- I'll talk to you later. <i>- Listen,</i>

828
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:24,875
<i>- if you don't pay the rent, I will...</i>
- Thank you, Mr. Wang. Bye.

829
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,750
Who are these people?

830
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,083
They came for Ms. Wang.

831
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,250
Over there,

832
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,541
they are talking.

833
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,416
They don't look like good men.

834
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,916
They were sent by her former employer.

835
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,250
She's in the middle of a lawsuit.
I guess they want her to drop the case.

836
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,500
They've been here several times.

837
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,250
Were there so many of them here before?

838
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,541
Not really.

839
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:45,625
Ask them to leave.

840
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:46,875
You know I won't sign it.

841
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,500
We are both just working for someone else.

842
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,875
Don't give me a hard time, okay?

843
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,083
Your life is on track now.

844
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,208
What else do you want?

845
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:53,541
Why do you think my life is good?

846
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,000
I haven't heard my son
calling me for years.

847
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,916
Do you think that's good?

848
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,791
Well, you can hear us talking now,
can't you?

849
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,916
I am wearing a hearing aid.

850
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,458
Then just keep them on.

851
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:02,250
It's only a few hundred yuan, right?

852
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,833
My son skipped breakfast for a year

853
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,041
to save money to buy it for me.

854
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:06,000
Such a good son.

855
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,041
Who's responsible for my ear injury?

856
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:09,875
- It's definitely not mine.
- Whose is it then?

857
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:11,875
- Whose is it?
- It's definitely not mine.

858
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:15,250
My job is to get you to sign this
so that I can leave. Understand?

859
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,083
I've said it many times. I won't sign it.

860
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:19,166
How come everyone else can sign but you?

861
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,666
- Are your ears so valuable?
- Yes.

862
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,583
My ears are that valuable.

863
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,500
So many years
without protective equipment,

864
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,916
our ears are damaged.

865
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,583
If I sign it, you will never treat workers
as human beings.

866
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:31,541
You are just a damned worker.
Don't try to challenge the factory.

867
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,708
- Yes, I'm just a worker.
- You have to sign it today no matter what.

868
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,166
- I'm just a worker.
- Do you understand?

869
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,208
I won't sign it.

870
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,625
For the last time, I won't sign it.

871
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,333
Go back and tell your boss
to wait until the court decides.

872
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:43,958
Wait for the court's decision?

873
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,000
Come back. Did I say you can leave?

874
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:47,833
Did I let you leave?

875
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:49,375
Sign it.

876
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,000
- Don't touch me.
- I did, so what?

877
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,291
- Don't touch me.
- What are you going to do about it?

878
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,625
- Don't touch me.
- Damn you--

879
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,208
Damn you!

880
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,625
How dare you fight back?

881
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:02,958
You are quite brave.

882
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,791
How many times have I told you?

883
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:07,708
I'll tell you.

884
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,250
You are only making this hard on yourself.

885
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:18,791
Who the hell are you?

886
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:19,833
Who the heck are you?

887
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:20,958
I am her factory manager.

888
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,333
What are you waiting for?

889
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,583
Get them!

890
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,041
Liu, let's go help!

891
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,375
Okay.

892
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,375
Calm down!

893
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,250
- Buddy!
- Great!

894
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,166
- This way.
- Okay.

895
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:49,416
Calm down.

896
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,375
- Come on.
- You bastard! Picking on a woman.

897
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,625
I don't even hit
female characters in games.

898
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,625
Brat, you are a factory manager?

899
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:00,250
You? A factory manager?

900
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,791
With just three old and sickly people?
Do you want to die?

901
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,666
Damn it. Get him!

902
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:21,375
Stop fighting.
It's not necessary, stop it!

903
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:22,583
Buddy, Mr. Manager!

904
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:26,291
Tell your men to stop.

905
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,041
You stop first.

906
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,166
You tell them to stop!

907
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,208
Guys.

908
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,041
Stop, everybody!

909
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,500
Are you really workers?

910
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,583
You are all gangsters, right?

911
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:49,833
Cut the crap!

912
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,166
The police will arrive soon.

913
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,375
If you dare to come here again.

914
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,125
The hearing aid was bought by my son.

915
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,250
I'll kill you all!

916
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,750
- Ms. Wang.
- I'll kill you!

917
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,958
- Calm down!
- No, Ms. Wang.

918
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,375
- Calm down, Ms. Wang!
- This is too far, Ms. Wang!

919
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:06,750
Ms. Wang, calm down.

920
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,083
I can repair your hearing aid.

921
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,333
I can fix it. I can fix the hearing aid.

922
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,333
- Ms. Wang.
- He can fix it! Shout!

923
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,583
- He can fix it!
- He can fix it!

924
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:15,666
- I can fix it!
- He can fix it!

925
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,083
Wait a minute.

926
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,500
What are they shouting?

927
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,083
The hearing-aid.

928
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,166
I can fix it.

929
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:22,666
For real?

930
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:23,583
For real.

931
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,083
I can fix it for you.

932
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,625
I promise.

933
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,000
<i>Justified self-defense</i>

934
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,916
<i>is allowed.</i>

935
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:36,666
Going overboard

936
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,708
is not allowed.

937
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,000
Look at them,

938
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,958
you guys have gone too far.

939
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:43,916
I'm sorry.

940
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,875
We shouldn't have done it.

941
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,333
Boss,

942
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,458
don't apologize.

943
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,833
They started to pick on
our female colleague first.

944
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,875
Why should we apologize?

945
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,375
Sir, what are you complaining about?

946
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,583
If you hit harder,

947
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,125
you would be detained like them.

948
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,000
You're just bluffing.

949
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,125
That's it. Write a guarantee
and then you can leave.

950
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:06,000
{\an8}I'm sorry for all the trouble today.

951
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,583
{\an8}It's my treat...

952
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,250
Tonight.

953
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,375
{\an8}I will hold a banquet too.

954
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,250
{\an8}I'm getting married
on the 3rd of next month.

955
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,166
{\an8}Getting married?

956
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,250
{\an8}Did he say getting married?

957
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,750
- Yes.
- Congratulations, Liu!

958
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,500
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

959
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,583
This is great news!

960
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:25,833
All of you must come.

961
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,125
{\an8}Good!

962
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,458
{\an8}COLLEAGUES OF THE GROOM

963
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:56,625
"Hello, everyone!

964
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,250
I am the manager of Nice View
Electronic Components Company.

965
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,916
I am honored to give a speech

966
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,250
as the groom's leader.

967
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,708
I sincerely wish

968
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:07,083
Mr. Liu Hengzhi and Ms. Wu Xiaoli,

969
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,291
the newlyweds, a happy marriage.

970
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:12,208
May every day be beautiful
and happy for you as a couple."

971
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:14,041
- Yes!
- Yes!

972
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,541
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Jing.

973
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:20,208
Please welcome the best man and bridesmaid
to present the rings.

974
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:24,833
Hengzhi,

975
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:25,875
at this moment,

976
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,041
if you're ready,

977
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:31,625
you can place the ring
on your wife's finger.

978
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,291
Don't cry.

979
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:48,666
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

980
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:59,375
{\an8}Dad, please have tea.

981
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,583
{\an8}Mom, please have tea.

982
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:29,791
The food is ready.

983
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:33,708
{\an8}There you go.

984
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,541
{\an8}CHEF: XU FU

985
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:37,291
The food is here!

986
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:41,541
{\an8}Boss,

987
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:42,583
{\an8}say something.

988
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:45,916
Long live the Nice View!

989
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,291
- Yes.
- That's great.

990
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,583
- Long live the Nice View!
- Nicely said.

991
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,958
Long live the Nice View!

992
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,541
- Boss!
- The bride is here!

993
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,375
- Come.
- Congratulations! May you have kids soon.

994
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,958
- Thank you.
- Thank you, boss.

995
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,875
- Take it easy.
- Thank you, Mr. Liang.

996
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:59,500
- Mr. Zhong. Sure.
- Have many kids!

997
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,833
- Longhao, cheers!
- Cheers!

998
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,041
Boss,

999
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:05,541
you aren't in a relationship, are you?

1000
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,791
No girlfriend. Hey!

1001
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,708
- Come over here! Hurry!
- Take it easy!

1002
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:11,125
They are my crane operator friends
from the construction site.

1003
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,083
- Enjoy your chat!
- Hi, Mr. Jing.

1004
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:14,708
- Mr. Jing.
- Boss.

1005
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,041
- Boss.
- Excuse me!

1006
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,583
Mr. Jing,
I think you and I go well together.

1007
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,291
- I don't think so.
- I'm the best for you.

1008
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:22,500
- About the last time--
- Move! Hear this, sir.

1009
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,916
Let's drink the cross-cupped wine today

1010
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,708
- and I'm yours. Deal?
- What wine?

1011
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:38,583
Come home with me.

1012
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:39,500
Hey.

1013
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:41,083
Let's have a drink.

1014
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,041
Sit.

1015
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,375
I heard you have dogs too.

1016
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,541
What is the name of your dog?

1017
00:55:58,625 --> 00:55:59,958
- Tyson.
- What?

1018
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:00,875
Tyson.

1019
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,041
The boxer?

1020
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,208
I was the platoon leader.

1021
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,041
If I didn't take the lead, who would?

1022
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,250
I was just getting
my mine-clearing gear ready.

1023
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,166
As soon as I heard

1024
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,125
a boom under the foot,

1025
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:15,041
my leg

1026
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,375
was gone!

1027
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:25,500
It didn't hurt.

1028
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,916
It didn't hurt at all.

1029
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,333
Boss,

1030
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,916
it was my fault before.

1031
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,333
I was acting stupid.

1032
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:34,875
I'll make it up to you

1033
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:37,000
by chugging down a beer for you.

1034
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,125
It was a mistake. I'll down it all.

1035
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,083
There's not a drop left.

1036
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,375
Just take a sip.

1037
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:55,416
I'll take a sip.

1038
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,375
Just a sip.

1039
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:03,125
That's it.

1040
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,791
That's enough.

1041
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:07,416
No more.

1042
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,333
You finish it.

1043
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:13,458
I'll drink it up!

1044
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:19,958
Boss.

1045
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:22,125
Can I

1046
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:24,375
still work for you?

1047
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:02,166
Jing Hao,

1048
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,166
can you drink with me?

1049
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,166
No problem.

1050
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:08,041
Cheers!

1051
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,291
After this whole thing is done,

1052
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,791
what do you want to do?

1053
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,708
You already know.

1054
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:22,833
I want my sister cured.

1055
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,416
I mean for yourself.

1056
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:28,416
What do you want to do for yourself?

1057
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,500
Maybe...

1058
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,666
I would go back and finish college.

1059
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:56,958
Jing Hao.

1060
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,166
PAY THE RENT TO OPEN THE DOOR!

1061
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,000
<i>I'm with my sister now.</i>

1062
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,208
<i>Please open the door first.</i>

1063
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:58,291
<i>No way.</i>

1064
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,458
<i>What if you dash with your stuff
the moment I open the door?</i>

1065
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,375
I have lived here for two years.
Where can I go?

1066
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,416
<i>I don't care.</i>

1067
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,125
<i>Pay the three months' rent you owe.
Then move out.</i>

1068
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,458
I really don't have the money now.

1069
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:09,208
- Just give me a few more days and I'll... <i>- Enough.</i>

1070
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,375
<i>If you don't pay the rent,</i>

1071
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,875
<i>don't even think
about taking away your luggage.</i>

1072
01:00:57,041 --> 01:01:00,125
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
is busy now.</i>

1073
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,666
<i>Please try again later.</i>

1074
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,291
Jing Hao.

1075
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,750
{\an8}I'm sleepy.

1076
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,791
{\an8}Where are we going to sleep tonight?

1077
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,333
Keep your voice down.
Don't let the boss hear you.

1078
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,666
Sorry for the trouble, ma'am.

1079
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,625
It's okay.

1080
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,083
I am on the night shift today.

1081
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,166
You can sleep in my bed.

1082
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,750
Thank you, ma'am.

1083
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:45,333
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
is busy now.</i>

1084
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,541
<i>Please try again later.</i>

1085
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:02,833
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
is busy now.</i>

1086
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:04,333
<i>Please try again later.</i>

1087
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:30,416
Where is Tao?

1088
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,333
- He is not in the dormitory?
- No, he's not.

1089
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,083
Where else could he be?

1090
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:43,916
Shuffle and deal the cards.

1091
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:46,458
- Why are you here?
- You tell me.

1092
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,500
I've been looking for you all night!

1093
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,000
- You kept hanging up on me.
- What's with you?

1094
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,500
You're gambling here
when you still owe me?

1095
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,416
Let's go. Pay me back.

1096
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,541
- I'll hit you...
- Let's go!

1097
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:55,416
- Let go.
- Go!

1098
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,583
Pay me back!

1099
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,041
What's wrong with you?

1100
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,041
Go!

1101
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,000
Don't touch me!

1102
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,541
I can go by myself.

1103
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:06,625
Go then.

1104
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,875
- Move.
- I can go by myself.

1105
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,708
When I said, "Look for it yourself,"
you really did.

1106
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,541
Don't you think you're going too far,
Jing Hao?

1107
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:26,208
What a great friend you are.

1108
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:27,250
Friend?

1109
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,083
- Is this all you have?
- Yes.

1110
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,291
I lent you money
because you said your mom was ill.

1111
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,708
Was she even sick?

1112
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,125
You really would make up
all kinds of lies.

1113
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,583
Gambling bastard.

1114
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:44,958
Like you never gambled?

1115
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,916
Your bets had much higher stakes.

1116
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,500
If you lose the bet,
you will lose your sister!

1117
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,625
What am I supposed to do?

1118
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,666
You tell me!

1119
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,250
What else can I do, but gamble?

1120
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:56,125
Can't the landlord give you more leeway?

1121
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,583
I owe him three months' rent

1122
01:04:57,583 --> 01:04:58,916
and only paid a small part of it.

1123
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,875
If you and the neighbors hadn't helped me,

1124
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:02,416
he wouldn't even have
handed back my stuff.

1125
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,250
Besides, it's nice here.

1126
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,458
We have water and electricity.

1127
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,625
Don't worry.

1128
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,458
Anyway, if you need anything,

1129
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,000
just tell me, okay?

1130
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,750
Bye.

1131
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:30,958
Jing Hao.

1132
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,000
Why aren't we staying at Mr. Liang's?

1133
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,458
We have already stayed for two nights.

1134
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,416
We can't bother them too much.

1135
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,375
Right?

1136
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,625
Are you feeling better?

1137
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:48,625
It's time for bed.

1138
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,125
Aren't you going to sleep?

1139
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,875
I'll work right next to you.

1140
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,416
Will you always be here?

1141
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,500
I am always with you.

1142
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:24,625
Just go to sleep.

1143
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,666
{\an8}NICE VIEW MOBILE PHONE REPAIR

1144
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:17,583
Wake up.

1145
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:41,333
Tuesday morning. Wenbo Building.

1146
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,250
- All right.
- All right.

1147
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,583
- Thank you, Ma Yue.
- Thank you, Ma Yue.

1148
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:54,708
Neck.

1149
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,875
- It's itchy.
- Don't move.

1150
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,416
Don't move. Sit still.

1151
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:30,750
Stop it.

1152
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:40,916
{\an8}Jing Hao.

1153
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,500
Am I going to die?

1154
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:52,458
No, you won't.

1155
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,958
We will be able to do the surgery soon.

1156
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:00,041
Will it hurt?

1157
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,416
No.

1158
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,833
You'll be fine as soon as you wake up.

1159
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,291
All right.

1160
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,375
<i>We're catching up.</i>

1161
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:29,541
By the way,

1162
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:31,500
how long have we delayed
the factory's rent payment?

1163
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:34,833
It should've been paid last week.
Mr. Yang has called me several times.

1164
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,916
Don't worry about it.

1165
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,458
The cleaning team
will pay me early next month.

1166
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,833
I'll give him the rent and utilities then.

1167
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,083
Fine.

1168
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,208
I'll talk to him.

1169
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:43,208
Okay.

1170
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,333
Jing Hao.

1171
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:04,166
Jing Hao.

1172
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:06,500
Do you want to pee?

1173
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,958
- I'll get you a potty.
- There's a noise outside.

1174
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:16,750
Stay here and don't move.

1175
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,958
- Why is someone living here?
- How do I know?

1176
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:42,333
Run!

1177
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:44,625
Hey! What are you two doing?

1178
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,416
Run!

1179
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,708
Stop!

1180
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,625
Stop! Stop the car!

1181
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:53,708
Stop!

1182
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:58,750
Stop the car!

1183
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,791
Stop!

1184
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:01,291
- Jing Hao!
- Give me!

1185
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:02,291
- Give me back my stuff.
- Let go!

1186
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,125
Are you crazy?

1187
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:07,666
Stop the car!

1188
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,791
Jing Hao!

1189
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,500
Let go. Hands off!

1190
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,000
Are you crazy!

1191
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,458
Do you want to die?

1192
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,666
Stop the car!

1193
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,208
{\an8}- Stop the car!
- Fuck off!

1194
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:30,708
Are you out of your mind?

1195
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:33,458
Stop! Give me back my stuff!

1196
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,791
Give me back!

1197
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,208
Bastard. Screw you!

1198
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,208
Go to hell!

1199
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,500
Pull over! Stop the car!

1200
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:37,333
Are you all right, sir?

1201
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:39,041
Are you okay?

1202
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:41,791
- Call the police.
- Okay.

1203
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:52,958
Where is your shoe?

1204
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,000
Your stuff was found.

1205
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,125
Sign here.

1206
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,541
We'll send it to you as soon as possible.

1207
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:52,083
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

1208
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:54,875
If you hadn't held one of them down first,
we couldn't have found them.

1209
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:57,083
Don't pull these dangerous stunts
from now on.

1210
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:59,625
These illegal scavengers
would do literally anything.

1211
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:01,458
Why would you risk your life

1212
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:02,791
just for a bunch of old phones?

1213
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,041
It's not worth it.

1214
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:09,958
It is.

1215
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:31,875
{\an8}<i>Take off your gloves.</i>

1216
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:39,958
And the other one.

1217
01:17:58,333 --> 01:17:59,875
How many days
have you been working like this?

1218
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:02,958
Three days.

1219
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:06,708
Damn you!

1220
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:07,791
What are you doing?

1221
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,083
Today, you dropped a bucket.

1222
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:10,833
Tomorrow, you could kick the bucket.

1223
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,166
{\an8}Don't you know the rules?

1224
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:15,083
{\an8}How dare you work when you're injured!

1225
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:17,666
Did you forget how Xu died?

1226
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
Put away your equipment
and get out of here.

1227
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,458
Let me work until the end of this month.

1228
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,791
I really need the money.

1229
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:35,958
And you're risking your life for it?

1230
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:38,500
Go!

1231
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:46,916
Wait.

1232
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:50,541
Payment for three days of work.

1233
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,625
This is more than three days'.

1234
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:12,458
Just go, my friend.

1235
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:16,833
Thank you, Ma Yue.

1236
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,250
Jing Hao.

1237
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,541
Come here.

1238
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:28,000
<i>This is for the utility bills.</i>

1239
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,875
What about the rent last month?

1240
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,458
It should have been paid half a month ago.

1241
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:33,875
Can I pay you back when the work is done?

1242
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,416
Do you want an extension again?

1243
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,041
- No.
- Jing Hao.

1244
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,458
I've been nice to you, haven't I?

1245
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,291
When have you ever paid your rent on time?

1246
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,125
Also, how much trouble
you've caused recently?

1247
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:44,041
Did I let you pay for the gate?

1248
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:45,708
And how many times
have the cops shown up here?

1249
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,375
How can I explain it to my clients?

1250
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,750
Will you pay me for my losses
when you're done?

1251
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,375
Mr. Yang.

1252
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:53,916
I'm really having a hard time.

1253
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,375
I'm so sick of this.

1254
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:56,458
Who isn't having a hard time?

1255
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:57,791
Do you think you're the only one?

1256
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,708
We are all having it rough!

1257
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:01,500
I'll give you three days.

1258
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,125
Either you pay me the rent for two months

1259
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,250
or you leave.

1260
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:13,708
<i>It continues to rain during the day
throughout the city.</i>

1261
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:16,625
<i>The daily rainfall in some areas
has exceeded 100 mm.</i>

1262
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,875
<i>According to the latest forecast
of Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau,</i>

1263
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,041
<i>the super typhoon Utor</i>

1264
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,791
<i>will pass through the city
earlier than predicted.</i>

1265
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:25,333
<i>There will be strong winds
and heavy rainfall throughout the city.</i>

1266
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:27,000
<i>All schools and employers are requested</i>

1267
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,333
<i>to provide flood-prevention preparations</i>

1268
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,375
<i>for those who are already
in school or on duty.</i>

1269
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,708
Please give me a small advance.

1270
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,375
I can charge 50,000 yuan less
for the total amount.

1271
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,000
No way.

1272
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:46,833
It's 100,000.

1273
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,000
Do you think you are at a flea market?

1274
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,708
Haggling like that?

1275
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:54,250
Mr. Li,

1276
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:55,833
please help me this time.

1277
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:57,458
- I recently--
- It's not up to me.

1278
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:00,083
You promised Mr. Zhao
not to ask for an advance.

1279
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,125
Then give me his phone number.

1280
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,708
I'll talk to him myself.

1281
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:08,541
Have you ever wondered
why he gave you my business card?

1282
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,958
It's because he doesn't want you
to contact him at all.

1283
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:13,458
The reason why he signed with you

1284
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:15,958
was because you earned his respect
at that time.

1285
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,833
If he sees the way you are now,

1286
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,625
do you think
he will still pay any attention to you?

1287
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:22,125
I was right about you.

1288
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:24,333
You are just an overambitious wage earner.

1289
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,791
You dare to say yes to everything,

1290
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,458
but you can't get anything done.

1291
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,666
Now get out.

1292
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:31,625
If the typhoon comes,

1293
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:33,000
you won't be able to leave.

1294
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:03,416
Mom.

1295
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:11,458
Do you want some water?

1296
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,666
Do you know

1297
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,791
that I'm leaving this world?

1298
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:34,041
I don't want you to go.

1299
01:25:35,166 --> 01:25:37,541
I don't want to go either.

1300
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:05,000
I will take good care of Tongtong.

1301
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,500
You must also take care

1302
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:15,208
of yourself.

1303
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:07,000
<i>I rented the container to others.</i>

1304
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,625
<i>You have three days to move out.</i>

1305
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:11,375
<i>When the rain stops,
I'll get someone to clean out your stuff.</i>

1306
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:12,875
<i>Then you can come to take it away.</i>

1307
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,208
Boss!

1308
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,375
What a mess!

1309
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:44,708
The wind was strong last night.

1310
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:46,916
This Utor is quite impressive, isn't it?

1311
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,250
Are our goods all right?

1312
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,666
We did such a good job of waterproofing,

1313
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:51,500
- there must be no problem.
- Definitely.

1314
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,166
That tarp is pretty thick.

1315
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:59,041
Why are you sitting here?

1316
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:04,000
There are only two weeks left
before delivery.

1317
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,416
I can't pay your salary.

1318
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:09,625
The factory has been taken away
and rented to others.

1319
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:12,333
We have to move out in three days.

1320
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:15,291
I don't know what to do.

1321
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,375
I'm sorry, everyone.

1322
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:26,416
Boss.

1323
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,041
We have heard about the difficulties.

1324
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:31,333
It's just about the wages and factory.

1325
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:33,500
You are not the only one in our factory.

1326
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,041
We are all employees of this factory.

1327
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:36,458
That's right.

1328
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,333
Why do you treat us like outsiders?

1329
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,666
Let me make a stand first.

1330
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,333
You can pay me the wage
after the work is done.

1331
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,416
That's fine with me.

1332
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,625
Me too.

1333
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:44,875
I'm fine with it.

1334
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:46,875
- Me too.
- I'm pretty fine with it.

1335
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:48,666
I don't even need to be paid.

1336
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:51,458
Don't worry about the factory either.

1337
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:53,375
- We've worked it out.
- Yes.

1338
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,208
No employer dared to hire me
after I left prison,

1339
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:56,500
so I've always been working at home.

1340
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,041
I have also done some outsourcing.

1341
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:00,708
Each of us can get some work
to do at home.

1342
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:02,458
My roommates can also help.

1343
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:03,916
We can definitely meet the schedule.

1344
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,333
Yes. We are already skilled workers.

1345
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:07,250
By the way,

1346
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,166
what about the goods under the shed?

1347
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,083
It's not a big deal.

1348
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,541
I'll call my wife to give a hand.

1349
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:13,250
You know what she does for a living.

1350
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,958
That shed is nothing to her.

1351
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,458
My wife is also coming to help.

1352
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:19,416
We'll pack everything up
and take it with us today.

1353
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,208
I've talked to the old folks
at the nursing home,

1354
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:23,458
they'd love to have you there.

1355
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,125
It's all solved.

1356
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:27,333
- Yes, let's do it.
- What are we waiting for?

1357
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,583
Wait a minute,

1358
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,000
there is one more thing.

1359
01:29:30,791 --> 01:29:31,833
Boss.

1360
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,791
What do you think?

1361
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,458
Honey, you're awesome!

1362
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:10,000
- Go!
- Go!

1363
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,083

01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,250

Why are you awake?

1371
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:53,375
I dreamed about Mom.

1372
01:32:58,125 --> 01:32:59,875
She said I've grown up

1373
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,416
and she asked me to take care of you.

1374
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,500
You must already be exhausted, right?

1375
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:20,666

1403
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,125
And they are?

you were able to finish the order on time.

01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,291
It's not an easy feat.

1410
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,791
As for quality,

1411
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:05,458
our agreement
was a minimum of 85% pass rate

1412
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:08,166
and your pass rate

1413
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:11,208
is 87%.

1414
01:36:13,583 --> 01:36:14,875
Congratulations.

1415
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:16,250
You've made it.

1416
01:36:20,916 --> 01:36:23,250
It looks like you went through a lot
to get it done.

1417
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:28,916
There is one more thing.

1418
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:32,458
I've asked the products
and marketing departments

1419
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:33,833
to do a research study.

1420
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:37,208
I'm going to build a green industry chain.

1421
01:36:38,166 --> 01:36:40,083
And I want to continue working with you.

1422
01:36:41,583 --> 01:36:44,208
Let's sign a contract for two years
at five million yuan.

1423
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:47,041
Will you join me?

1424
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:56,666
Can I ask a question?

1425
01:36:57,833 --> 01:36:58,916
Yes.

1426
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,750
Is there an advance payment this time?

1427
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:11,416
Yes, there is.

1428
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:21,041
We really did our best this time.

1429
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,166
