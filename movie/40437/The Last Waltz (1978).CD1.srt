' The night they drove old Dixie down

472
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,800

' But a Yankee laid him in his grave

481

' And l swear by the mud below my feet

482

' You can't raise a Caine back up

00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,900
' The night they drove old Dixie down

' La la-la la la-la la-la laaa

495
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,500
(cheering)

496
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,600
A dream come true.

497
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,700
Fascinating. Scary.

498
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,100
Kind of hard to take the first time.

499
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:39,800
You have to go there about two or three
times before you can fall in love with it.

500
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,800
But that happens eventually.

501
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,800
We stayed at the Times Square Hotel
on 42nd Street.

502
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
The title of the hotel,

503
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,200
it sounded like it was conveniently
located in midtown Manhattan.

504
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,800
What did we know? We came out
of the hotel after checking in,

505
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,700
and you think ''lt's great
to be back in New York.''

506
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,400
Movie theatres for ever.

507
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,400
All these friendly women
walking up and down the street.

508
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,900
lt was... lt was great.

509
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion.
lt was an adult dose.

510
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,300
So it took a couple of trips to get into it.

511
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,700
You just go in the first time and you get
your ass kicked and you take off.

512
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:32,300
As soon as it heals up,
you come back and you try it again.

513
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,200
Eventually, you fall right in love with it.

514
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:42,900
Roulette Records was in the middle
of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley.

515
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,400
The songwriting capital of the world.

516
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,700
And we met some of
the greatest songwriters ever.

517
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:54,000
Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus.
Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller.

518
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,800
They were all then.
Carole King. Neil Diamond.

519
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:03,400
At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter
was the low man on the totem pole.

520
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,600
But then, these people...

521
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,800
And here come the '60s,

522
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,600
with change and revolution
and war and assassinations,

523
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,300
and a whole other frame of mind
coming along.

524
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:22,400
And these songwriters were expressing
the feelings of people in the street.

525
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,400
ln a way, it was kind of the beginning
of the end of Tin Pan Alley.

526
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,300
(' ''Dry Your Eyes'')

527
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,100
' Dry your eyes

00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,200
' Right through the lightning

' To the dark side of the moon

552
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,600
' To that distant falling angel

- (cheering and applause)
- Thanks very much.

566
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,000
(Scorsese)
When you started playing as The Band,

567
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,900
you shied away from publicity a lot.

568
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,300
Talk about that a little.

569
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,900
That was just part of a lifestyle
that we got to love in Woodstock.

570
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,900
We got to like it, you know,
just being able to chop wood

571
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,800
or hit your thumb with a hammer.

572
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:14,100
We'd be concerned with fixing
a tape recorder, fixing a screen door.

573
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,800
Stuff like that.
And getting the songs together.

574
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,800
We always seemed
to get a whole lot more done

575
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,800
when we didn't have
a lot of company around.

576
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,000
We were more productive.

577
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And as soon as company came,
of course, we'd start having fun.

578
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,700
You know what happens
when you have too much fun.

579
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,800
(laughter)

580
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,600
Something we've kind of evaded
around here, but l'll ask it now.

581
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,000
- What about women and the road?
- l love 'em.

582
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,200
That's probably why
we've been on the road.
