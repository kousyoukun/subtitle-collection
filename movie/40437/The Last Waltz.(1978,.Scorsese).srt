(cheering)

496
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:23,378
A dream come true.

497
00:49:23,465 --> 00:49:25,456
Fascinating. Scary.

498
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:30,663
Kind of hard to take the first time.

499
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:36,024
You have to go there about two or three
times before you can fall in love with it.

500
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:38,096
But that happens eventually.

501
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:43,064
We stayed at the Times Square Hotel
on 42nd Street.

502
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,502
The title of the hotel,

503
00:49:45,585 --> 00:49:49,897
it sounded like it was conveniently
located in midtown Manhattan.

504
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:54,342
What did we know? We came out
of the hotel after checking in,

505
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:57,064
and you think ''lt's great
to be back in New York.''

506
00:49:57,145 --> 00:49:59,659
Movie theatres for ever.

507
00:49:59,745 --> 00:50:03,863
All these friendly women
walking up and down the street.

508
00:50:04,225 --> 00:50:06,864
lt was... lt was great.

509
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:10,824
Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion.
lt was an adult dose.

510
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:16,337
So it took a couple of trips to get into it.

511
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:21,383
You just go in the first time and you get
your ass kicked and you take off.

512
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:26,380
As soon as it heals up,
you come back and you try it again.

513
00:50:26,465 --> 00:50:29,263
Eventually, you fall right in love with it.

514
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:36,615
Roulette Records was in the middle
of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley.

515
00:50:36,705 --> 00:50:39,014
The songwriting capital of the world.

516
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:42,142
And we met some of
the greatest songwriters ever.

517
00:50:42,225 --> 00:50:47,174
Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus.
Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller.

518
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:50,018
They were all then.
Carole King. Neil Diamond.

519
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:56,216
At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter
was the low man on the totem pole.

520
00:50:56,305 --> 00:50:59,342
But then, these people...

521
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:01,416
And here come the '60s,

522
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:05,134
with change and revolution
and war and assassinations,

523
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:08,615
and a whole other frame of mind
coming along.

524
00:51:08,705 --> 00:51:14,575
And these songwriters were expressing
the feelings of people in the street.

525
00:51:14,945 --> 00:51:19,302
ln a way, it was kind of the beginning
of the end of Tin Pan Alley.

526
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:22,056
(' ''Dry Your Eyes'')

(Scorsese)
When you started playing as The Band,

567
00:54:32,745 --> 00:54:35,418
you shied away from publicity a lot.

568
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,700
Talk about that a little.

569
00:54:37,785 --> 00:54:42,984
That was just part of a lifestyle
that we got to love in Woodstock.

570
00:54:43,065 --> 00:54:47,855
We got to like it, you know,
just being able to chop wood

571
00:54:47,945 --> 00:54:50,664
or hit your thumb with a hammer.

572
00:54:50,985 --> 00:54:56,696
We'd be concerned with fixing
a tape recorder, fixing a screen door.

573
00:54:56,785 --> 00:54:59,379
Stuff like that.
And getting the songs together.

574
00:54:59,705 --> 00:55:02,094
We always seemed
to get a whole lot more done

575
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:05,097
when we didn't have
a lot of company around.

576
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:08,141
We were more productive.

577
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:12,423
And as soon as company came,
of course, we'd start having fun.

578
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:16,385
You know what happens
when you have too much fun.

579
00:55:16,465 --> 00:55:18,456
(laughter)

580
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:23,977
Something we've kind of evaded
around here, but l'll ask it now.

581
00:55:24,065 --> 00:55:27,296
- What about women and the road?
- l love 'em.

582
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:30,377
That's probably why
we've been on the road.

583
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:34,815
- That's it.
- Not that l don't like the music.

584
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:43,458
l thought you weren't supposed
to talk about it too much.

585
00:55:43,545 --> 00:55:46,582
- No, l guess we're not.
- l thought we were supposed to...

586
00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:50,897
pan away from that sort of stuff,
get into something else.

587
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:54,376
Since the beginning,
since we started playing together,

588
00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:58,458
just like we've all grown just a little bit,
so have the women.

589
00:56:00,145 --> 00:56:03,262
- You know? And it's amazing.
- That's right. That's good.

and trying to figure out where we were.
