我们举办了最后一场音乐会，乐队的最后一场音乐会，我们称之为《最后的华尔兹》。
We gave our final concert, The Band's final concert, and we called it The Last Waltz.

28

I feel they're probably some of the greatest influences on music on a whole generation.

37

We wanted it to be more than just a concert. We wanted it to be a celebration.

38

一周过去了，有点令人沮丧。
And the week went on and it was a little depressing.

116
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:20,413
尤其令人沮丧的是，我们一分钱都没有。没有面团。
And it was especially depressing cos we didn't have any money at all. No dough.

117
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:23,251
在某一时刻，我们没有更多的食物钱。
At one point, we had no more food money.

118
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:31,806
后来，我们从加拿大引进了这种大衣，那种有口袋什么的大大衣，我们有一些常规。
It got to the point where, coming from Canada, we had these overcoats, big overcoats with pockets and everything, and we had a little routine.

119
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,475
我们一起去购物中心。
We'd go to the shopping centre, all together.

120
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:40,393
-但我待在家里，对吧?-不，你没有。
- But I stayed home, right? - No, you didn't.

121
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:41,650
我买了香烟。
I got the cigarettes.

122
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:47,116
我把烟机倒过来给每个人都拿了香烟。
I turned the cigarette machine upside down and got everybody some cigarettes.

123
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:51,288
-是的，但那是在…-你给我弄了点熏肠。
- Yeah, but that was on the... - You got me some baloney.

124
00:20:51,378 --> 00:21:03,721
我们会去超市，几个人会买几块面包，因为那是你能买到的最便宜的东西。
We'd go to the supermarket and a couple of people would buy a couple of loaves of bread, cos that was about the cheapest thing you could get.

125
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:08,360
而我们其他人则会在过道里狂欢，填满香肠。
And the rest of us would be carousing the aisles, stuffing baloney.

126
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:16,657
到了该走的时候，拿面包的人会走到收银台，我们会说:“我们在车上等你。”你把面包拿出来。”
It'd be time to leave, the guy with the loaves would go to the checkout and we'd say "We'll meet you at the car. You take the bread out."

127
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,290
-你会回来的!-有了这些大衣…
- Ya'll come back! - And with these overcoats...

令人着迷。可怕的。
Fascinating. Scary.

255
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:39,050
第一次有点难以接受。
Kind of hard to take the first time.

256
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:44,641
你必须去那里两三次，才能爱上它。
You have to go there about two or three times before you can fall in love with it.

257
00:51:44,725 --> 00:51:46,802
但这最终会发生。
But that happens eventually.

258
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:51,982
我们住在42街的时代广场酒店。
We stayed at the Times Square Hotel on 42nd Street.

259
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:59,108
酒店的名字，听起来像是位于曼哈顿市中心。
The title of the hotel, it sounded like it was conveniently located in midtown Manhattan.

260
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:06,581
我们知道什么?我们登记入住后走出酒店，你会想“回到纽约真好”。
What did we know? We came out of the hotel after checking in, and you think "It's great to be back in New York."

261
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:09,287
永远的电影院。
Movie theatres for ever.

262
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:13,671
这些友好的女人在街上走来走去。
All these friendly women walking up and down the street.

263
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:16,800
……这是伟大的。
It was... It was great.

264
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:20,930
对，纽约，是成年人的地盘。这是成年人的剂量。
Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion. It was an adult dose.

265
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:26,679
所以我们花了几次时间才了解它。
So it took a couple of trips to get into it.

266
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:31,941
你只是第一次进去，然后被揍了一顿，然后就走了。
You just go in the first time and you get your ass kicked and you take off.

267
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:37,152
一旦伤口愈合，你就会回来再试一次。
As soon as it heals up, you come back and you try it again.

268
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,159
最终，你会爱上它。
Eventually, you fall right in love with it.

269
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:47,825
轮盘唱片公司就在锡盘巷这个神秘的地方。
Roulette Records was in the middle of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley.

270
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:50,327
世界歌曲创作之都。
The songwriting capital of the world.

271
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:53,588
我们遇到了一些最伟大的词曲作者。
And we met some of the greatest songwriters ever.

272
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:58,836
摇滚歌曲作者。医生Pomus。莫特舒曼。利和短距起落。
Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus. Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller.

273
00:52:58,931 --> 00:53:01,801
他们当时都是。卡罗尔的国王。尼尔钻石。
They were all then. Carole King. Neil Diamond.

274
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:08,265
在那个时候，一个词曲作家处于最底层是不公平的。
At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter was the low man on the totem pole.

275
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:21,195
但是，这些人……到了60年代，伴随着变革、革命、战争和暗杀，一种全新的思维模式也随之出现。
But then, these people... And here come the '60s, with change and revolution and war and assassinations, and a whole other frame of mind coming along.

276
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:27,409
这些词曲作者在街头表达人们的情感。
And these songwriters were expressing the feelings of people in the street.

277
00:53:27,795 --> 00:53:32,339
在某种程度上，这是锡盘巷尽头的开始。
In a way, it was kind of the beginning of the end of Tin Pan Alley.

278

非常感谢。
Thanks very much.

289
00:56:51,225 --> 00:56:56,848
当你开始作为乐队的一员演奏时，你总是避开公众的视线。
When you started playing as The Band, you shied away from publicity a lot.

290
00:56:56,939 --> 00:56:59,228
谈谈这个。
Talk about that a little.

291
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:04,738
这只是我们在伍德斯托克喜欢的生活方式的一部分。
That was just part of a lifestyle that we got to love in Woodstock.

292
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:12,746
我们会喜欢它的，你知道，只是能够砍木头或用锤子打你的拇指。
We got to like it, you know, just being able to chop wood or hit your thumb with a hammer.

293
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:19,037
我们只关心修理录音机，修理纱门。
We'd be concerned with fixing a tape recorder, fixing a screen door.

294
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,835
诸如此类。然后把歌曲收集起来。
Stuff like that. And getting the songs together.

295
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:27,798
当我们周围没有很多人的时候，我们似乎总是能做得更多。
We always seemed to get a whole lot more done when we didn't have a lot of company around.

296
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:30,972
我们的工作效率更高。
We were more productive.

297
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:35,437
当然，只要有客人来，我们就会开始玩得很开心。
And as soon as company came, of course, we'd start having fun.

298
00:57:36,898 --> 00:57:39,569
你知道你玩得太开心会发生什么。
You know what happens when you have too much fun.

299
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:47,486
我们一直在回避的问题，但我现在就问。
Something we've kind of evaded around here, but I'll ask it now.

300
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:50,946
-那女人和公路呢?-我喜欢。
- What about women and the road? - I love 'em.

301
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,159
也许这就是我们一直在路上的原因。
That's probably why we've been on the road.

302
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:58,787
——就是这样。-不是我不喜欢这音乐。
- That's it. - Not that I don't like the music.

303
00:58:04,846 --> 00:58:07,800
我以为你不应该谈论太多。
I thought you weren't supposed to talk about it too much.

304
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:15,557
-不，我想我们没有。-我以为我们应该远离那些东西，去做点别的。
- No, I guess we're not. - I thought we were supposed to... pan away from that sort of stuff, get into something else.

305
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:23,442
从一开始，自从我们开始一起玩，就像我们都成长了一点点，女人们也一样。
Since the beginning, since we started playing together, just like we've all grown just a little bit, so have the women.

306
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:28,452
——你知道吗?和令人惊奇的。——这是正确的。这很好。
- You know? And it's amazing. - That's right. That's good.

307

432
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:53,606
加斯是我们认识的最了不起的音乐家之一。
Garth was one of the most amazing musicians that we knew.

433
01:25:53,698 --> 01:25:56,533
他演奏得比我们听过的任何人都好。
He could play better than anybody we ever heard.

434
01:25:56,617 --> 01:26:05,457
如果我们让加斯当音乐老师，他就能加入乐队。
And Garth joined The Band if we would make him the music teacher.

435
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:11,335
我们不知道为什么，但我们说:“当然可以。我的意思是，无论如何我们都很感兴趣。”
We didn't know why but we said "Sure. I mean, we're interested anyway."

436
01:26:11,925 --> 01:26:18,131
我们不得不每周付给他10美元来上这些音乐课。
And we had to pay him $10 a week each for these music lessons.

437
01:26:18,224 --> 01:26:20,929
然后我确定那只是一段重复。
Then I was sure it was a riff.

438
01:26:21,019 --> 01:26:24,103
但后来我发现了它的真面目。
But then I found out what it really was.

439
01:26:24,189 --> 01:26:35,189
那就是，他的出身和他的音乐教育背景，在这个时候告诉他的父母我们要加入一个摇滚乐队就像把一切都倒进了下水道。
It was that, where he was coming from and his musical education, to tell his parents at this point that we was joining a rock-and-roll band would have been like pouring it down the drain.

440
01:26:35,285 --> 01:26:41,738
所以他以音乐教师的身份向他的人民和他的背景证明了这一点。
So he justified it to his people and his background by being a music teacher.

441
01:26:42,584 --> 01:26:50,459
有一种观点认为爵士乐是邪恶的，因为它来自邪恶的人。
There is a view that jazz is evil because it comes from evil people.

442
01:26:50,551 --> 01:27:03,477
但事实上，52街和纽约街头最伟大的牧师是音乐家。
But, actually, the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians.

443
01:27:03,565 --> 01:27:06,436
他们在做最伟大的治疗工作。
They were doing the greatest healing work.

444
01:27:07,111 --> 01:27:14,608
他们知道如何通过音乐来治愈并让人们感觉良好。
And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.

不过，大部分的表演都像旅行表演，像帐篷表演。
Most of the show stuff, though, was like travelling shows, like tent shows.

462
01:30:33,752 --> 01:30:37,880
一个是沃尔科特的兔脚吟游诗人。
One was Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels.

463
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:42,710
-那是什么?-沃尔科特的兔脚吟游诗人是的。
- What was that? - Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels. Yeah.

464
01:30:44,722 --> 01:30:48,720
他们以前是让节目开场的，对吧?
They used to have the show start, right?

465
01:30:49,352 --> 01:30:54,228
他们会有歌手、演员和节目的不同部分。
They'd have the singers and the players and the different parts of the show.

466
01:30:54,316 --> 01:31:03,990
然后主持人会在最后一集之前出来解释说，孩子们回家后，他们会进行午夜漫步。
Then the master of ceremonies would come out just before the finale and explain that, after the kids go home, they'd have the midnight ramble.

467
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:07,780
——午夜……?-午夜漫步。
- The midnight...? - The midnight ramble.

468
01:31:07,871 --> 01:31:13,412
歌曲会变得更有趣，笑话也会变得更有趣。
The songs would get a little bit juicier and the jokes'd get a little funnier.

469
01:31:13,503 --> 01:31:18,130
最漂亮的舞者会跳下来，摇晃几下。
And the prettiest dancer would really get down and shake it a few times.

470
01:31:18,216 --> 01:31:25,263
很多摇滚鸭子的走路、舞步和动作都来自于这些。
A lot of the rock-and-roll duck walks and steps and moves came from a lot of that.

471
01:31:25,349 --> 01:31:37,646
每个人都这么做，所以，当你看到猫王、杰瑞·李·刘易斯、查克·贝里或波·迪德利真正改变世界的时候，它不是凭空而来的，不是凭空而来的。
Everybody did it and so, when you would see Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry or Bo Diddley really shaking it up, it didn't come out of nowhere, It didn't come out of the air.

472
01:31:37,737 --> 01:31:41,106
这就像每个人都要去看的当地娱乐节目。
It was like the local entertainment everybody was going to see.

473
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:52,201
所以当他们把它展示给世界的时候，它就像一个未知的野兽出现了，这是魔鬼送来的怪异的音乐，你知道吗?
So when they exposed it to the rest of the world, it was like this unknown beast that had come out, the grotesque of music that the devil had sent, you know?
