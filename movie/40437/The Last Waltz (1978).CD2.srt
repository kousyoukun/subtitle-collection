Most of the show stuff, though,
was like travelling shows, like tent shows.

329
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,700
One was Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels.

330

- Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels. Yeah.

00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,100
They'd have the singers and the players
and the different parts of the show.

333
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,900

would come out just before the finale

334
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:09,700
and explain that, after the kids go home,
they'd have the midnight ramble.

335

- The midnight ramble.

336
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,300
The songs would get a little bit juicier
and the jokes'd get a little funnier.

337
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,900

get down and shake it a few times.

338
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:31,000
A lot of the rock-and-roll duck walks and
steps and moves came from a lot of that.

see Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis

to the rest of the world,

344
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,300
it was like this unknown beast
that had come out,

345
