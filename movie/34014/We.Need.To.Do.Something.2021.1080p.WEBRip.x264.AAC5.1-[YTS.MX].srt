2
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:41,653
- God, why won't it stop?
- Just give it a second, will you?

3
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:45,028
Where were you? You should have
been home by six.

4
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,073
I told you guys I was doing
homework with Amy tonight.

5
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,575
What happened there?
Did you hurt yourself?

6
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,785
Amy's, uh, cat scratched me.
It's fine.

7
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,913
- It's no big deal.
- Why weren't you answering my calls?

8
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:57,668
Look I'm sorry, I just...

9
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,260
I think it's an EF5.

10
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,844
It's not a tornado, baby.

11
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:11,012
- It might be an EF5.
- What the hell is an EF5?

12
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,558
It's like when two tornadoes
come together,

13
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,434
and they form one giant tornado.

14
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,438
- It rips everything in its path.
- God, is that true?

15
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,731
No, it's just a thunderstorm.
Everything's gonna be okay.

16
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,028
Jesus, that was loud.

17
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,575
It was a little loud.

18
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,244
Sounded like a gunshot.

19
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:35,036
Maybe it's an EF6. Wait.

20
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,664
Is there even such a thing
as EF6?

21
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,957
Baby, there's not gonna be
a tornado.

22
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,421
It's just a thunderstorm,
and it's going to pass.

23
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,674
Most things come to an end,
don't they?

24
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,028
Mom, I think something
might be wrong.

25
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:09,362
Like with the storm,
something bad might be happening.

26
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,117
No, it'll pass.

27
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,584
Who wants to play
The Great Hotel Escape?

28
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:23,919
- You can never read the cards when we play that.
- I can read!

29
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:26,005
- Guys...
- Mom, tell her I can read.

30
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:27,339
Mel, your brother can read.

31
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,633
See! I told you.

32
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,385
- Mom, did you see what Mel...!
- Enough!

33
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,549
- Who's that?
- Nobody.

34
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,551
Right.

35
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,555
Who wants to play
Goths and Vandals?

36
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:18,474
- Not The Great Hotel Escape?
- Not right now, baby.

37
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:22,102
Look we just pull out the Goths
and Vandals game.

38
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:25,106
I bet you by the time we get
through the first round,

39
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,190
the storm will've passed.

40
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,152
Unless the tornado picks up
our house

41
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:31,279
- and carries it away or something.
- Shut up!

42
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,448
That only happened
in The Wizard of Oz.

43
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,366
It could happen here too.

44
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,577
God, you're so dumb.

45
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,039
What did I tell you about talking
to your brother like that?

46
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:43,417
Sorry.

47
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,044
Are you?

48
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,565
- Who's calling?
- It's just nobody.

49
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,526
- Yeah, who's calling?
- Nobody!

50
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,195
Huh!

51
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:16,076
You really think this bathroom
is gonna protect us

52
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,952
from a big, old tornado
that swoops in and...

53
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,205
You really think it's gonna
make any difference at all?

54
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,914
Well if you don't wanna be
in here with us,

55
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,418
- you know where the door is.
- Oh! Now I have a choice.

56
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,505
What is going on?

57
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,813
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

58
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,065
Why did the lights go out?

59
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,025
You guys, it's a thunderstorm,

60
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:54,986
Lightning probably hit
a transformer or something.

61
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:56,823
Stop freaking out for no reason.

62
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,032
It's a tornado!
It's a tornado! It's a tornado!

63
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:02,413
...Bobby?

64
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,755
Did lightning hit the house?!

65
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:15,883
- What the hell was that? Oh, God, what was that?
- Jesus Christ.

66
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,805
I don't know. I don't know.

67
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,058
Dad no! Don't go.

68
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,728
Just get the light, okay?

69
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,776
What the fuck?

70
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:37,656
- What's wrong?
- It won't open.

71
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,116
What do you mean it won't open?

72
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,620
I mean it won't fucking open!

73
00:07:44,748 --> 00:07:46,873
Melissa, give me your phone.

74
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,711
- No. What? Why?
- Just give me the goddamn phone.

75
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,927
Oh, what the fuck?

76
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,554
God damn it!

77
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:03,683
- What is it?
- A tree.

78
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:07,310
- A what?
- I think a fucking tree

79
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,436
- is blocking the door.
- Oh, God.

80
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,106
What tree? You can't move it?

81
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:15,445
Does it look like I can
move it? Fuck!

82
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,447
Maybe it's a tree
from the backyard.

83
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,532
- What?
- Where we buried Spot.

84
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,325
- What?!
- Ugh!

85
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,578
God damn it, Mel.

86
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,748
- Is Spot dead?
- Let's talk about this in a minute, okay?

87
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,876
- But Spot ran away!
- Spot ran away!

88
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,421
God damn it.

89
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,347
- Jesus Christ.
- Where's my phone?

90
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,015
- Calm down.
- Dad, where's my phone?

91
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,768
- I dropped it.
- Ugh!

92
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,895
Would you stop being
hysterical? It's a storm.

93
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:54,273
Amy is fine. Jesus Christ.

94
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,317
It's not the end
of the goddamn world.

95
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:04,786
Mel! Shut the door!

96
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,579
Close the door!

97
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:20,844
- Are we stuck?
- I don't know. The roof is gone.

98
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,141
Oh, my God. Come here.

99
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,731
What are we gonna do?

100
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,543
We have to do something,
don't we?

101
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:57,839
Don't we?

102
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:02,384
Guys!

103
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,979
I guess we wait.

104
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:19,777
Amy...

105
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:22,840
Hey, I was waiting for you
to stop,

106
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,049
back by the bleachers?

107
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,637
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

108
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:32,267
But you saw something else,
didn't you?

109
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,190
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Didn't mean to what?

110
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,234
Stare?

111
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:44,988
Maybe I wanted you to.

112
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:52,036
What happened?

113
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:55,165
I used to be a cutter.

114
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,797
Why?

115
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,217
Because I used to be dead.

116
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,918
How bad is it? The tree?

117
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:59,268
You think the insurance
will cover it?

118
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,942
I don't know.

119
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,739
You gonna try your phone
again?

120
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,662
Wait, Dad, can I use
your phone? To call Amy.

121
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,249
Something's wrong with it.
Try yours.

122
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:22,209
Oh, I can't.

123
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,214
- You can't?
- Yeah, I can't. It's dead.

124
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,465
Oh, God damn it.

125
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,180
Fucking piece of shit.

126
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,305
- Uh...
- What?

127
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,683
Well, I'm trying to check
the news,

128
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,563
but this fucking thing
isn't working.

129
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,689
Okay, well... Do you want me
to have a look at it?

130
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,026
No, I don't want you to have
a look at it.

131
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:50,403
Okay. I was just asking.

132
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,156
Dad, can I please try
your phone?

133
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:54,909
I have to pee.

134
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,433
I can't go with you guys here.

135
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,228
I don't know
what to tell you, Mel.

136
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,861
I can still hear you pee, sis.

137
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:35,075
Oh, my God, Bobby, Jesus!

138
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,211
Wow, it was really an EF5.

139
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,627
Yeah. It might have been.

140
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,172
You guys think
it's over now?

141
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:53,131
Do you think people died?

142
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,467
No, baby, nobody died.

143
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:55,552
It's very possible.

144
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,721
Seriously?

145
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,726
Hey, you guys! I see a snake!

146
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:08,313
- What?! Bobby get away from there.
- Where?

147
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,859
Over there, where the dressers
all smashed.

148
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,196
I don't see anything.

149
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,740
I think it's a rattlesnake.

150
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:20,367
What do you know about
rattlesnakes?

151
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:21,954
It's right there.

152
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,874
Bobby, there's no snake.

153
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:33,215
Bobby, get inside
and shut the door.

154
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,469
Thank you.

155
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:47,270
I saw a rattlesnake
on YouTube once.

156
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:48,813
It was eating an alligator.

157
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,356
What?

158
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:53,275
No rattlesnake's ever eaten
an alligator.

159
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:55,986
It was a baby alligator.

160
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,448
Oh, well it was a baby
alligator, sure.

161
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,116
Of course,
that makes perfect sense.

162
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,867
You should have mentioned that
before.

163
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,578
The only snakes that I ever met
in my life eat mice

164
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,829
and other shit.

165
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,334
- Don't look at me like that.
- Can't believe you dropped it.

166
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:54,002
It was an accident.

167
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,173
Well, how are we supposed to
get out of here now?

168
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,634
I don't know.

169
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:04,431
Can't we just break the door down?
What about the wall?

170
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:08,391
- The wall?
- The wall or the door or whatever.

171
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,439
Can't you just bust a hole
through it and crawl out?

172
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:13,816
Can we just...

173
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,735
- I don't... how? With what?
- I don't know.

174
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,111
Can't you just punch through it
or something?

175
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,612
No, I can't just punch
through it.

176
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,534
That thing is made of solid oak.

177
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,661
That is tempered glass blocks.
That is a rock wall.

178
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:32,291
This is tile. These walls are
six feet thick.

179
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:35,002
How the fuck are we supposed to
do that?

180
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,379
You wanna break your hand?

181
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,130
- Look, everyone...
- Be my guest.

182
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:41,175
Everything's going to be fine.
It hasn't been that long.

183
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:43,052
Someone will come.

184
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:45,515
Jesus Christ, Pollyanna.

185
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:54,648
What if it wasn't just a storm,
Mom?

186
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,433
Is there anybody out there?

187
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,086
- We need that.
- Need what?

188
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,507
We need it to stay hydrated.

189
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,261
But I'm not finished with it
yet.

190
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,473
Well, can you be?

191
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,345
Here, baby.

192
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:52,473
- I washed it out, don't worry.
- But Mom...

193
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:56,353
Just drink the water, Bobby!
Just drink it!

194
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:21,796
What, I don't get any now?

195
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,341
Relax, I'm just fucking around.

196
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,679
What's the matter? You can't
take a joke any more?

197
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,686
Hey, why don't you just chill out?

198
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:40,479
Hey, I'm just messing around.

199
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,189
Don't overreact
every time I say...

200
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,065
Listen, God damn it.

201
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,151
We have enough shit
piling up here

202
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:48,696
- without your weight added to it.
- What are you talking about?

203
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,363
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

204
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,535
So don't try acting innocently
all of a sudden.

205
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:57,537
- Dee...
- Look, you wanna fight? Fine.

206
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,998
Save it for when this is
all over because right now,

207
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,293
nobody wants to hear it.

208
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,267
Whoa.

209
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,191
No. You have a six?

210
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,444
Yeah. Here.

211
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,699
Mom, I'm hungry.

212
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:35,828
Yeah, me too.

213
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:38,205
I'm so sorry.

214
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,707
I wish we'd brought some goldfish
crackers with us or something.

215
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:45,002
Ugh! Goldfish crackers
are disgusting.

216
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,548
Hmm. More for me then.

217
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:52,843
I want some eggs.
I want a thousand eggs. With cheese.

218
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,389
- Gross, only old people like eggs, Bobby.
- No, they don't.

219
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:58,850
Mom, tell sis all types
of people like eggs.

220
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,936
Melissa, all types of people
like eggs.

221
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:04,354
Nuh-uh. Only old people.

222
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,358
And you know what that
makes you, Bobby?

223
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,861
- Don't say it...
- You know what that makes you?

224
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:14,532
Mom, tell sis not to say it.

225
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,868
- Melissa, don't say it.
- Okay, okay.

226
00:22:20,957 --> 00:22:23,416
It makes you a tiny, old man.

227
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:27,836
Mom!

228
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:30,299
Calm down. It's okay.

229
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:36,680
- A tiny, old man.
- Stupid asshole.

230
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:42,351
Fuck! Fuck!

231
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:46,022
Fucking piece of shit!

232
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,440
Stupid fucking battery!

233
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:51,777
You fucking useless asshole
technology!

234
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,075
You fucking cunt! Fuck you!

235
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:59,534
You motherfucker!
Die, you fucking bitch!

236
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:03,083
You stupid cunt! Fuck you!

237
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:07,796
Fuck you in your ass!

238
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:29,691
Why hasn't anybody come yet?

239
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,532
I don't know.

240
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,332
Not a tornado.

241
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:49,837
Something else.

242
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:53,298
You mean...?

243
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:57,886
I think...

244
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,353
I think...

245
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:12,944
It doesn't make any sense.

246
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:18,408
What doesn't make any sense?

247
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:24,580
We have neighbors.
Someone would've come.

248
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:28,584
Seen the tree.

249
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,546
Why haven't they, Daddy?

250
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:35,967
They're all dead.

251
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:38,719
Why would you say that?

252
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:45,852
Or they've already been
evacuated.

253
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:52,859
Either way, it doesn't
bode too well for any of us.

254
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,032
I used to be dead.

255
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:48,789
Most people are.
They just don't realize it.

256
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:51,834
What do you mean?

257
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:59,217
They said I was crazy.
That I did it for attention.

258
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,596
You ever heard
of Cotard delusion?

259
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,266
No, I don't think so.

260
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,561
Walking corpse syndrome.

261
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:15,108
It's like a mental illness,
I guess.

262
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,487
People become convinced that
they're actually really dead.

263
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,376
Is that why you used to cut
yourself?

264
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:40,633
If I could still bleed, then maybe I
could remind myself that it wasn't real,

265
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:43,553
that I was still alive.

266
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:50,392
Did you want to be?

267
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:57,150
When you would cut yourself,
what were you hoping to see?

268
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,034
Mel, that's starting to look
infected.

269
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,495
It's fine.

270
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:55,372
I'm gonna put something on it,
okay?

271
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,376
Mom, Dad, I'm hungry.

272
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:00,588
Okay, I don't know
what to say about that.

273
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,925
I want an omelet
with ham and cheese.

274
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:08,888
But Sissy doesn't get any
cheese, you hear that, sis?

275
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:12,348
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What, what, what, what?

276
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,932
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh,
my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

277
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:15,685
Bobby, you stay there.

278
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:17,352
- What the f...
- Oh, Jesus. What?

279
00:28:19,274 --> 00:28:22,190
- Bobby, get in the tub!
- Oh, my God!

280
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:25,529
- Okay, okay. Stay there. Stay there.
- Oh, my God.

281
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,449
Shit!

282
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,658
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

283
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,159
Okay. Okay, I'm coming to you.
Hold on.

284
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,245
- Oh, my God.
- Robert...

285
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:36,456
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

286
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:40,042
- Oh, my God. What the fuck?
- What do I do? What do I do?

287
00:28:40,044 --> 00:28:41,627
Just don't move.

288
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:43,254
Jesus!

289
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,716
- Oh, my God!
- Christ!

290
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:49,217
- Did it bite you?
- No, I don't think so.

291
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:50,220
Okay.

292
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,679
Dad be careful.

293
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,515
Oh, shit. Robert, are you okay?

294
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,898
Mel, throw me that plunger.

295
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:02,189
Mel, careful.

296
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:04,399
Shit, I'm sorry. Fuck.

297
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:07,736
- Jesus, Jesus.
- Shit, shit, shit.

298
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:09,406
Okay. Okay.

299
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,408
It's gonna bite you!

300
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:15,745
- Dad, it's gonna bite you.
- What are you doing?

301
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:19,082
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

302
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,542
Be careful. Stop,
it's gonna aggravate it.

303
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:23,294
Oh, my God!

304
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:25,338
- Robert!
- Dad, stop!

305
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,465
- Go away!
- Robert!

306
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:30,178
Fuck...

307
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,558
Fuck you, snake!

308
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,854
- Is it gone?
- I'll fucking eat your whole fucking family.

309
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,510
Yeah!

310
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:22,272
Wait a minute...

311
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,450
Should we have eaten it?

312
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,830
- Gross. No.
- Snakes with extra cheese! Cheese with extra snakes!

313
00:30:40,832 --> 00:30:42,917
I don't know how to eat
a snake, do you?

314
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:47,044
Yeah, you just pick it up

315
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,090
and bite the head off,
like Ozzy.

316
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,383
Wasn't that a bat?

317
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:56,638
Snakes are just bats
that can't fly.

318
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,601
What the fuck?

319
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,537
Tell me again.

320
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,666
Tell you what, baby?

321
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:28,671
You know what. Please?

322
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:34,719
Okay. Where do you want me
to start?

323
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:39,554
Tell me about how big and fat
you were, Mom.

324
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:42,684
Hey.

325
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:47,479
It looked like I was smuggling

326
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:53,361
a big, gigantic watermelon
underneath my shirt,

327
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:58,157
but all that was under there
was you.

328
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,498
I was saying, "Patience, baby.
I need you to have patience."

329
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:07,291
Because you weren't
at the hospital yet.

330
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,670
You were at a Walmart.

331
00:32:10,337 --> 00:32:11,338
That's right.

332
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:16,676
You and Sissy.
But Sissy was my age.

333
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:19,469
No, Sissy was
a little bit younger, but yes,

334
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:23,142
Sissy was... was there with us.

335
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:26,395
What were you buying?

336
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:30,898
A pizza, because?

337
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,066
You were tired of cooking
all the time.

338
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:35,319
Oh. Yes, that's right.

339
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:38,908
I was nine months pregnant,
and I was exhausted.

340
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:45,832
Where was Dad?

341
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,296
I don't remember.

342
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,674
Dad, where were you
when I was born?

343
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,092
He was drunk at a bowling alley.

344
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:00,764
No, don't.

345
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,065
Mommy, I'm tired.

346
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:17,446
Just close your eyes baby.

347
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:22,074
I'm tired, Mommy, I'm tired.

348
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:38,218
Yeah... I'm tired too.

349
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:06,871
- What is it?
- Shh...

350
00:34:28,308 --> 00:34:30,976
- I think it's a dog.
- A dog?

351
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:32,228
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

352
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,353
- Bobby!
- Bobby! God damn it!

353
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:34,357
No, don't!

354
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:39,529
He's licking my hand, you guys.

355
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:43,029
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

356
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,074
You are, you are.

357
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,909
Wait, is that actually a dog?

358
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:48,955
Yeah, check.

359
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,335
Oh, my God.
It's... it's actually a dog.

360
00:34:57,337 --> 00:34:59,004
- Is it?
- All right, well, be careful.

361
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:01,632
You don't know what kind
of shit that thing has.

362
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,761
Do you think it's Spot?
I think it's Spot.

363
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,888
Spot, is that you boy?
It is, isn't it?

364
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,600
Everybody said you're buried in the
backyard. But that isn't true, right?

365
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:14,270
You just ran away and now
you've come to save us.

366
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:16,815
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

367
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm a good boy!

368
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:25,323
Oh, my God! Help! Help!

369
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:28,828
Oh, my God! Help!
Oh, my God! Help!

370
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:32,788
Help! Oh, my God!

371
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,540
Why did it talk?
Why did it talk?

372
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,917
Let my daughter go,
I'll fucking kill you!

373
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:41,254
Oh, my God, help me!

374
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:44,341
I'll kill you!

375
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,636
Mel!

376
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:52,683
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

377
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:06,783
What the fuck?

378
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:36,103
Holy shit.

379
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,768
He comes back, I'll break his
goddamn skull.

380
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,190
Don't most things die with
their tongues ripped out?

381
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:25,402
What do I look like?
Some kind of fucking doctor?

382
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:29,990
Well, we at least need to try,
right?

383
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:31,910
Try what?

384
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,620
We haven't eaten.

385
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,251
Mel, you're one sick fuck.

386
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:45,504
Here.

387
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:47,966
Mom, do I have to eat
the tongue, too?

388
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,346
Yes, baby.

389
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:56,473
Okay, we have to eat this
in tiny bites

390
00:37:56,475 --> 00:38:00,685
because it'll be tough to chew
but easy to choke on,

391
00:38:00,687 --> 00:38:01,939
so we have to be careful.

392
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:04,899
One more day in here
I'd probably take a chomp

393
00:38:04,901 --> 00:38:07,025
out of that creep's dick.

394
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,527
That's disgusting.

395
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:11,321
Yeah, dicks are for peeing,
not eating, Dad.

396
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:21,540
Well, I'll try it first.

397
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,585
I'm the one who caught it,
right?

398
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:37,015
Ah!

399
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:39,766
Oh, are you okay?

400
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:48,942
- Give me another.
- You sure?

401
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:51,321
Yeah, all of you.
We need to eat.

402
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:04,728
How did everything get
so fucked up?

403
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,317
You know what happened.

404
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,822
You know exactly what happened.

405
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:18,118
True.

406
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:21,996
Joe.

407
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:35,634
What are you doing?

408
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:40,013
My God, get the fuck
out of here!

409
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:42,267
Go, you fucking creep.

410
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:50,105
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

411
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:51,399
He follows me everywhere.

412
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,986
Yeah, what a fucking dunce.

413
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,996
Why couldn't he just
take a fucking hint?

414
00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:12,379
In retrospect, we shouldn't be
surprised at what he did.

415
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:15,632
No.

416
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,812
You don't have to say anything.

417
00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:33,901
Anything you think, I think.

418
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:37,739
How?

419
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:46,161
I don't understand
what's happening.

420
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:47,998
No one's asking you to.

421
00:41:52,712 --> 00:41:57,801
We had to do something to stop
from talking shit, right?

422
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,219
We had to.

423
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:25,620
Give me a hand?

424
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:32,794
Sorry, Spot.

425
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:40,802
Ugh.

426
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,105
The spell should be pretty
simple.

427
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:56,732
The mob does it all the time.

428
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:57,694
The mob?

429
00:42:58,486 --> 00:43:00,319
It convinces people to stop
talking shit about you.

430
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,071
Gives them a stern warning that
you aren't someone

431
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:03,199
to be fucked with.

432
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:07,828
So, let's give this motherfucker
a warning, shall we?

433
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,053
Back to you in a second.

434
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:37,858
I think his full name is Joseph.

435
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:40,611
I'm not sure it matters
that much.

436
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:03,093
Sorry, it's just my mom.

437
00:44:37,627 --> 00:44:41,089
This way, anything he tries to say
about me will be turned against him.

438
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:07,529
- I love you...
- Shh.

439
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:15,123
I love you too.

440
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:22,254
This is how we really make him
suffer.

441
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,982
Get up.

442
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:32,906
What? Dad?

443
00:46:32,908 --> 00:46:35,661
- Get up.
- Why?

444
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:42,542
- Dad, why?
- When I tell you to do something,

445
00:46:42,544 --> 00:46:44,212
do you you do it
or you question me?

446
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,797
I do it.

447
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:48,882
Then do it.

448
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:55,888
What are you looking at her for?
I'm the one talking to you.

449
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,100
What's going on?

450
00:46:57,975 --> 00:46:59,852
Bobby and I are gonna try
something.

451
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:04,731
Try what?

452
00:47:06,942 --> 00:47:08,902
- You see that?
- See what?

453
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:13,531
The goddamn opening.
Do you see it?

454
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:14,906
Yes.

455
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:17,745
Good. I need you
to go through it.

456
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:19,748
What?

457
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,417
I, I can't.

458
00:47:24,544 --> 00:47:25,962
You're not even gonna try?

459
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:30,255
You didn't even try.

460
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:32,134
What is it gonna hurt
if you just try?

461
00:47:33,261 --> 00:47:34,801
Why do you keep looking at her?

462
00:47:34,803 --> 00:47:36,596
I don't know!

463
00:47:36,598 --> 00:47:38,056
I'm your daddy, right?

464
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:40,143
Yes.

465
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,062
And you want to make your
mommy and daddy happy, right?

466
00:47:45,064 --> 00:47:46,313
Yes.

467
00:47:48,192 --> 00:47:50,361
Then you need to help us
get out of here.

468
00:47:51,654 --> 00:47:57,243
You need to climb through
there, squeeze through, please.

469
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,330
- Do not do...
- Shut up!

470
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,837
Come on, Bobby. You can do it.
I believe in you. Do it.

471
00:48:24,562 --> 00:48:26,397
You're not even trying!

472
00:48:28,732 --> 00:48:31,192
- But...
- Come on, you can fucking do it.

473
00:48:31,194 --> 00:48:32,734
Stop being a fucking baby
about it,

474
00:48:32,736 --> 00:48:34,487
just squeeze through there.

475
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,203
Come on, God damn it. Squeeze!

476
00:48:43,997 --> 00:48:44,957
Come on.

477
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,667
- God damn it.
- Dad!

478
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:50,795
You're almost there. Just do it.

479
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:52,173
Go through.

480
00:48:55,634 --> 00:48:57,761
God damn it,
squeeze through there!

481
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:01,556
- Dad! Stop!
- God damn it!

482
00:49:01,558 --> 00:49:03,266
What the fuck?
He's not gonna fit!

483
00:49:03,268 --> 00:49:05,270
Squeeze through!

484
00:49:05,937 --> 00:49:08,520
Get the fuck off of him!
Who are you?!

485
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:11,232
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

486
00:49:11,234 --> 00:49:13,734
- That's our son.
- I have a plan. I'm trying to get us out of here!

487
00:49:13,736 --> 00:49:18,406
- You're putting our son in the...
- What are we gonna die out here!

488
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:21,451
Now he's on the fucking ground.
Come over here!

489
00:49:21,453 --> 00:49:23,828
Bobby? Oh, my God.

490
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:27,080
Bobby? Bobby! Bobby, it's okay!

491
00:49:27,082 --> 00:49:29,000
Come on, come on.
Let's get in the tub.

492
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:30,960
Let's get in the tub. It's okay.

493
00:49:30,962 --> 00:49:32,754
It's okay, come on.
Let's get in the tub. Guys! Guys!

494
00:49:32,756 --> 00:49:34,672
In the tub, in the tub! Get in the tub.

495
00:49:34,674 --> 00:49:36,507
- Guys! Fuck!
- ...ain't doing nothing!

496
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:38,717
Guys, will you fucking stop?
Something happened to Bobby.

497
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:41,929
I think... oh, my God, I think it was the snake.

498
00:49:47,853 --> 00:49:49,562
Jesus Christ.

499
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,748
- Get the toilet lid.
- What?

500
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,417
The top of the fucking toilet,
get it!

501
00:50:16,632 --> 00:50:17,964
Okay, ready?

502
00:50:22,055 --> 00:50:23,431
Oh, God, did it get you?

503
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,223
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my gosh.

504
00:50:26,225 --> 00:50:30,060
- Here, let me see. Bobby.
- Let me see.

505
00:50:30,062 --> 00:50:32,605
Stop it. Oh, gosh.

506
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:35,857
- Okay. Can you get me your tie?
- What, why?

507
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:39,694
- For a tourniquet.
- No, we need to suck the venom out of him.

508
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:42,573
No, I think we need to make sure
the venom doesn't go to his heart.

509
00:50:42,575 --> 00:50:43,868
Give me your goddamn tie.

510
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,955
Okay, okay, one second, one second.

511
00:50:48,957 --> 00:50:51,167
Okay. Wait.

512
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,500
- No. No.
- Bobby!

513
00:50:53,502 --> 00:50:54,710
Oh, my gosh. Can you hold him?

514
00:50:54,712 --> 00:50:57,340
I can't do this.

515
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:04,514
All right.

516
00:51:10,477 --> 00:51:12,812
Did you get it?

517
00:51:12,814 --> 00:51:14,272
Did you get it? Did you get it?

518
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:16,190
Did you get it?

519
00:51:16,192 --> 00:51:17,902
I... I don't know, maybe.

520
00:51:21,823 --> 00:51:24,325
You're safe in here.
Baby? Baby, listen to me.

521
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:28,745
- We need water.
- Okay, I'll get you water in a minute. Just hold on.

522
00:51:28,747 --> 00:51:30,165
Motherfucker.

523
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,294
- I know, just relax, try to relax.
- Motherfucker.

524
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:39,504
Motherfucker.
Fucker. Motherfucker.

525
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:41,467
You fucking motherfucker.

526
00:51:42,426 --> 00:51:46,053
Is Bobby gonna be okay?
Mom, is Bobby gonna be okay?

527
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:48,975
Yes, he's gonna be fine!
Right, Bobby?

528
00:51:50,185 --> 00:51:55,105
- Gonna be fine.
- Motherfucker. You fucking motherfucker!

529
00:51:55,607 --> 00:52:00,320
You motherfucker. You motherfucking motherfucker!

530
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:05,200
You fucker! You motherfucking
motherfucker!

531
00:52:06,116 --> 00:52:11,038
You fuckers!

532
00:52:11,915 --> 00:52:13,955
You motherfuckers!

533
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:17,542
You motherfuckers!
Let me the fuck out of here!

534
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:19,377
I'll fucking kill you!

535
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:24,343
Open the fucking door!
God damn it!

536
00:52:25,636 --> 00:52:31,100
Oh, God, oh, God!

537
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:57,333
Bobby? Bobby, I'm so sorry.

538
00:52:57,335 --> 00:52:58,336
Bobby, I...

539
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:01,962
I'm so sorry,
this is all my fault.

540
00:53:01,964 --> 00:53:04,005
What? What are you talking about?
This is not your fault.

541
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:07,509
- This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no. Shh.

542
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:11,806
It's gonna be okay. Okay? You're gonna be okay.

543
00:53:11,808 --> 00:53:16,143
Honey. It's nobody's fault.
It's nobody's fault.

544
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:17,147
Okay?

545
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:22,235
Hello? Hello?

546
00:53:24,446 --> 00:53:28,283
What's going on? Are you okay?

547
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:34,372
Hey, who's there?

548
00:53:37,082 --> 00:53:38,292
We're over here.

549
00:53:41,254 --> 00:53:42,255
We need help.

550
00:53:43,631 --> 00:53:44,924
My son was bit.

551
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:50,136
My son was bit. Help!

552
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:53,054
- Do you see someone?
- I don't see shit.

553
00:53:53,056 --> 00:53:54,058
Hello?

554
00:53:55,643 --> 00:54:00,480
Please, we need a fucking
doctor.

555
00:54:00,482 --> 00:54:02,355
All right, follow my voice.

556
00:54:02,357 --> 00:54:05,484
Oh, Jesus Christ.

557
00:54:05,486 --> 00:54:07,152
We can't.

558
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:11,033
We're stuck.
You follow my voice.

559
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:17,957
Please. We... My son needs
medical attention.

560
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,835
Okay, okay, hold on.

561
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:24,631
I think I see you. Hold on.

562
00:54:25,881 --> 00:54:28,216
Hold on, I have to...
No...

563
00:54:28,218 --> 00:54:30,051
What's that... what?

564
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:31,928
Oh, God...

565
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,304
Oh, God! No!

566
00:55:12,971 --> 00:55:14,806
Do you see anything?

567
00:55:21,062 --> 00:55:23,230
No, I don't see anything.

568
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,573
But I think we should keep the
door closed for a little while.

569
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,538
But what about Bobby?

570
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,668
Shut the fuck up!

571
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:53,051
- I think we should ta...
- Shut the fuck up, all of you!

572
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:10,379
Okay, I think we can talk again.

573
00:57:11,714 --> 00:57:14,676
But we should still watch
our volumes, just in case.

574
00:57:16,468 --> 00:57:17,469
In case of what?

575
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,480
What did you see out there?

576
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:36,322
I don't know.

577
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,245
Did someone really shoot
that guy?

578
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,290
Maybe he was shooting something.

579
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:51,838
Something?

580
00:57:52,964 --> 00:57:54,215
I don't know.

581
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:00,596
Bobby needs help.

582
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,183
We all need help.

583
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:07,350
He needs a doctor, Robert.

584
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:08,896
You think I don't know that?

585
00:58:13,442 --> 00:58:14,736
Can that bite kill him?

586
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:21,618
I think I sucked everything out.
I don't... I don't know.

587
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:28,500
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck happened?

588
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:34,422
I'm scared.

589
00:58:37,926 --> 00:58:38,968
Me too, sweetheart.

590
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,269
What should we do?

591
00:58:54,274 --> 00:58:58,445
Guys, what should we do?

592
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:02,616
Mel, why the fuck do you keep
asking us what should we do?!

593
00:59:03,535 --> 00:59:05,618
We know exactly what you know.

594
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,496
Which is fucking nothing, okay?
Okay?

595
00:59:09,498 --> 00:59:10,500
Yeah.

596
00:59:16,506 --> 00:59:18,049
Okay, I'm sorry.

597
00:59:24,138 --> 00:59:25,765
I don't know what we're
gonna do.

598
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:29,100
I don't know what happened
out there.

599
00:59:29,102 --> 00:59:31,895
I don't know who shot who.
I don't know why they shot him.

600
00:59:32,939 --> 00:59:36,607
I don't know if we're ever gonna get
out of this bathroom to find out.

601
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:38,486
I don't even know if I wanna
find out.

602
00:59:41,364 --> 00:59:43,533
I don't know if Bobby's gonna
be okay.

603
00:59:46,995 --> 00:59:50,498
I don't know goddamn much
about anything right now.

604
01:00:17,192 --> 01:00:18,732
We killed him.

605
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:20,650
I know. We fucked up.

606
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:21,654
We?

607
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:26,868
We're in this together,
aren't we?

608
01:00:29,703 --> 01:00:31,247
Yeah, we're in this together.

609
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,832
Thank you for not abandoning me.

610
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:38,129
Hey, I would never, okay?

611
01:00:43,384 --> 01:00:44,761
It was a necromancy spell.

612
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:50,933
- That we used on Joe?
- No, Melly, not Joe. Me, I used it on myself.

613
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:55,939
I told you I was dead,
or at least I thought I was dead.

614
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:58,483
How?

615
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:01,859
It's complicated, and getting
into the details now,

616
01:01:01,861 --> 01:01:03,527
it's not important.
Right?

617
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,112
The point is this,
that specific kind of spell

618
01:01:05,114 --> 01:01:06,906
is supposed to bring back
people from the dead.

619
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:08,866
And something inside of me
was dead.

620
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:10,451
So it only makes sense
theoretically

621
01:01:10,453 --> 01:01:13,413
that it could... would work.

622
01:01:13,415 --> 01:01:14,416
Did it?

623
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,377
I, I thought I was better,
that I was healed.

624
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:21,045
Well, are you?

625
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:24,005
I haven't felt right
in the past couple of days.

626
01:01:24,007 --> 01:01:26,801
And I thought maybe it was all the
deepfake porno bullshit Joe pulled on me.

627
01:01:26,803 --> 01:01:28,680
But now I suspect
it's something else.

628
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:31,140
Something a little more evil.

629
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:33,891
Amy, you're not making
any sense.

630
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:36,810
What if it wasn't me
who was dead all this time?

631
01:01:36,812 --> 01:01:40,063
What if something was inside me
and that's what was dead?

632
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:43,859
And when I performed the spell,
it woke up?

633
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:47,196
- Amy, I...
- It's just been waiting for the perfect moment

634
01:01:47,198 --> 01:01:48,450
to announce its arrival.

635
01:01:52,453 --> 01:01:56,413
- I don't think...
- It has to be why the tongue spell went so wrong.

636
01:01:56,415 --> 01:01:58,583
I mean, I know we substituted
a dog's tongue for a cow's,

637
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:01,835
but still, I mean, holy shit,
what happened shouldn't have happened.

638
01:02:01,837 --> 01:02:06,214
Unless the person who conducted the ritual
had something hiding inside of them.

639
01:02:06,216 --> 01:02:10,051
Something beyond human.
Something...

640
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:11,221
Something what?

641
01:02:13,515 --> 01:02:14,683
Something diabolical.

642
01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:39,834
Why hasn't he checked
on you yet?

643
01:02:52,721 --> 01:02:56,891
- Why hasn't who...
- Dee. Don't play deaf.

644
01:02:56,893 --> 01:03:01,606
I know you hear me.
Don't you think he's worried?

645
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:08,028
I really don't think now is the
best time to talk about this.

646
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:14,786
I'm not trying to be
an asshole, God damn it.

647
01:03:16,913 --> 01:03:21,373
I'm just saying
we need to get out of here

648
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,292
or we're fucked.

649
01:03:23,294 --> 01:03:24,504
Especially now.

650
01:03:25,672 --> 01:03:27,507
Who are you guys talking about?

651
01:03:30,384 --> 01:03:32,594
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
I know.

652
01:03:33,805 --> 01:03:34,806
Well?

653
01:03:39,935 --> 01:03:41,478
I told him if he didn't...

654
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:44,897
...he didn't hear from me
by midnight,

655
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:48,152
then something might have
happened.

656
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:54,576
Something like what?

657
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,123
We really shouldn't
get into this.

658
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,252
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

659
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:13,594
I didn't know how you'd react.
I was scared.

660
01:04:15,053 --> 01:04:16,055
Scared of what?

661
01:04:19,975 --> 01:04:21,558
Of you.

662
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,439
What'd you think I'd do?
Hurt you?

663
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:32,737
- Maybe.
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Have I ever hurt you?

664
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:34,199
Stop ignoring me.

665
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,283
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?

666
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:41,788
I gave you chances,
plenty of chances.

667
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,540
I gave you years and years
of chances.

668
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:47,542
Years? You wanna talk
about years?

669
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:49,920
I'll talk to you
about fucking years.

670
01:04:49,922 --> 01:04:52,130
Talk about years
all fucking day long.

671
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:54,716
You think you're ever getting
out of here?

672
01:04:54,718 --> 01:04:56,551
You think any of us is ever
gonna walk

673
01:04:56,553 --> 01:04:58,804
- out of this door again?
- That's enough!

674
01:04:58,806 --> 01:04:59,808
You're the most...!

675
01:05:01,225 --> 01:05:05,185
You're the most delusional bitch
I've ever met in my entire life!

676
01:05:05,187 --> 01:05:07,522
- Mom...
- Please stop fighting. Please stop fighting.

677
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:09,776
You're scaring the kids again,
dear.

678
01:05:12,236 --> 01:05:16,239
Mommy.

679
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:18,366
It hurts, everything burns.

680
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:20,036
Everything burns.

681
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:24,165
His heartbeat...

682
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:27,708
Bobby, you gotta
calm the fuck down.

683
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,252
You gotta calm the fuck down
right now.

684
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:32,672
- Okay, that isn't helping.
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

685
01:05:32,674 --> 01:05:34,297
I don't know. Just not that.

686
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:41,931
Okay, baby.
Okay, baby, it's okay.

687
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:47,937
I want you to take nice,
deep breaths, okay?

688
01:05:47,939 --> 01:05:50,897
Okay, do it with me.

689
01:05:50,899 --> 01:05:52,526
Deep breath.

690
01:05:55,321 --> 01:05:58,448
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

691
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,324
That's good. That's good.

692
01:06:01,326 --> 01:06:04,120
That's good. That's good.

693
01:06:04,122 --> 01:06:08,040
Mom, tell me again.

694
01:06:11,337 --> 01:06:13,214
Tell you what, baby?

695
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:17,926
You know, please.

696
01:06:19,094 --> 01:06:21,430
We were trying to buy
a frozen pizza,

697
01:06:23,056 --> 01:06:26,308
and you decided you had been
in my belly long enough.

698
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:31,188
Your big, fat belly.

699
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:35,484
Like a watermelon.

700
01:06:37,404 --> 01:06:38,489
And I...

701
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:45,786
I couldn't walk anymore
and I was just...

702
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:53,671
It hurt so badly and you were
kicking me so hard.

703
01:06:57,299 --> 01:07:01,678
Did they call an ambulance?

704
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:03,515
They sure did.

705
01:07:05,933 --> 01:07:08,018
And while we were waiting
for the ambulance,

706
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:16,276
Sissy sat down
next to me and held my hand.

707
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,198
And she looked at me
and she said,

708
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,368
"Everything's gonna be okay.

709
01:07:27,205 --> 01:07:30,667
You just have to be brave
and wait little bit longer.

710
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:38,091
Nothing bad is gonna happen.
And everything will work out."

711
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:45,140
And you know what,
baby? She was right.

712
01:07:47,725 --> 01:07:51,103
She helped me be brave
and strong.

713
01:07:52,522 --> 01:07:55,188
And we waited for the ambulance
to come.

714
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:58,109
And when they came,
they pulled you out of me.

715
01:07:58,111 --> 01:08:01,112
Right there, on the frozen food
section floor.

716
01:08:05,076 --> 01:08:08,830
And that's why I know you're
gonna be okay.

717
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:12,915
And Sissy's gonna be okay.

718
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:17,169
And everything's gonna be okay
and someone's gonna come.

719
01:08:17,171 --> 01:08:21,132
Someone's gonna come and move
that tree and open that door.

720
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:24,552
And everyone will be waiting
outside.

721
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:25,930
And life will be better.

722
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:30,016
And everything will be okay.

723
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:32,727
You just have to hold on
a little bit longer, okay, baby?

724
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:37,397
Just have to hold on
a little bit longer. Okay?

725
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:38,817
Just trust...

726
01:09:16,022 --> 01:09:17,649
I'm so sorry.

727
01:09:23,237 --> 01:09:28,200
No! Baby!

728
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:30,745
My baby boy, come on!

729
01:09:31,996 --> 01:09:36,000
No, we just have to wait
a little longer! Please.

730
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:37,644
Where did you get this?

731
01:10:39,563 --> 01:10:41,732
Some secrets aren't meant to be
revealed.

732
01:11:04,171 --> 01:11:07,466
Now me.

733
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:09,469
Make me bleed.

734
01:11:24,024 --> 01:11:25,859
You can't fix the inevitable.

735
01:11:54,889 --> 01:11:56,015
Fuck.

736
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:30,841
God, why won't it stop?

737
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,972
Wait, where's, where's Bobby?

738
01:12:41,935 --> 01:12:43,188
Where he's always been, baby.

739
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:54,698
Mom, my stomach hurts.

740
01:12:59,203 --> 01:13:01,038
Why weren't you answering
my calls?

741
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:08,045
I... I don't feel good. I think...
I think there's something inside me.

742
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:11,131
We're all gonna die
because of you.

743
01:13:12,884 --> 01:13:16,552
- What?
- You didn't know your own daughter was a witch?

744
01:13:16,554 --> 01:13:18,348
Some fucking mother you are.

745
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:22,933
- Is that true, Mel?
- Please, help me.

746
01:13:22,935 --> 01:13:24,938
Don't. It's a trap.

747
01:13:25,979 --> 01:13:27,771
One of her witch traps.

748
01:13:27,773 --> 01:13:30,816
You try to help her and she'll
curse you.

749
01:13:30,818 --> 01:13:32,903
No, something is wrong.

750
01:13:38,952 --> 01:13:41,204
Just give me a second, will you?

751
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,392
Where am I?

752
01:14:05,854 --> 01:14:07,063
Where do you think?

753
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:11,567
Oh, God.

754
01:14:20,827 --> 01:14:22,660
Jesus Christ.

755
01:14:22,662 --> 01:14:24,330
Fuck, what's wrong with me?

756
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:33,005
After what happened, you...
you drank this, all of it.

757
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:41,389
And you couldn't even
leave any for me, could you?

758
01:14:44,184 --> 01:14:46,019
After... After what happened?

759
01:16:41,925 --> 01:16:43,343
This is all my fault.

760
01:16:49,309 --> 01:16:50,432
What?

761
01:16:50,434 --> 01:16:52,269
All of this is because of me.

762
01:16:53,563 --> 01:16:57,192
- No, it's not...
- No, no, just listen. You're not listening.

763
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:02,404
Last night...
Fuck, not last night.

764
01:17:03,697 --> 01:17:05,200
The night all of this started,

765
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:08,578
Amy and I...

766
01:17:11,038 --> 01:17:12,540
We did something bad.

767
01:17:15,085 --> 01:17:16,834
I don't understand.

768
01:17:16,836 --> 01:17:20,757
Amy was sick, okay?
Like, really, truly sick. We...

769
01:17:21,715 --> 01:17:24,383
We thought that there was
something inside her.

770
01:17:24,385 --> 01:17:27,972
Maybe something...
something bad, like a...

771
01:17:28,848 --> 01:17:31,641
Like a demon or spirit.

772
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:36,103
Mel, what the fuck
are you babbling about?

773
01:17:36,105 --> 01:17:37,689
A boy at school died.

774
01:17:40,484 --> 01:17:41,819
It was because of us.

775
01:17:44,029 --> 01:17:46,446
We did a spell,

776
01:17:46,448 --> 01:17:49,241
something to just make him stop
spreading rumors,

777
01:17:49,243 --> 01:17:50,495
making up lies.

778
01:17:52,831 --> 01:17:54,457
He was never supposed to die.

779
01:17:55,707 --> 01:17:58,584
But something went wrong.

780
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:02,088
That night, he choked on his
tongue while he was sleeping.

781
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,798
It's impossible to choke
on your own tongue.

782
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,303
Well, it happened.

783
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:10,762
And who knows what would have
kept happening

784
01:18:10,764 --> 01:18:12,267
if we hadn't put a stop to it.

785
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:17,605
What do you mean?

786
01:18:18,814 --> 01:18:22,109
- Put an end to...
- An end to the thing possessing Amy.

787
01:18:24,778 --> 01:18:25,779
A demon?

788
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,324
Well, we, we didn't know
what it was.

789
01:18:30,326 --> 01:18:32,953
Just that it was bad.

790
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:37,333
- What did you do?
- We tried to kill it.

791
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,921
We did a spell,
something we found online.

792
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:45,425
Online?

793
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:50,721
I think...

794
01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:57,479
I think that everything
that's been happening

795
01:18:58,645 --> 01:19:00,398
is because of a spell we did.

796
01:19:01,608 --> 01:19:03,777
I think we messed up really bad.

797
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:16,623
If that's true,
what you just said,

798
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:20,168
why didn't you say anything
before?

799
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:25,670
- I was afraid.
- Ah, brave enough to destroy the world

800
01:19:25,672 --> 01:19:28,173
but too chicken shit
to own up to it, is that it?

801
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:29,176
What?

802
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:32,388
I want you to look in that tub.

803
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:36,726
I want you to look
at your dead brother.

804
01:19:38,435 --> 01:19:40,061
Do you smell that?

805
01:19:40,063 --> 01:19:41,272
That's his corpse.

806
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:45,067
Decomposing, rotting.

807
01:19:46,443 --> 01:19:51,115
And all because of you and
your voodoo bitch girlfriend!

808
01:19:51,907 --> 01:19:56,076
I hope your fun little time on the
internet was worth murdering your family.

809
01:19:56,078 --> 01:19:59,871
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

810
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:03,459
Speak that way to my daughter again
and I'll slit your fucking throat.

811
01:20:03,461 --> 01:20:05,713
I look forward
to the day.

812
01:20:12,303 --> 01:20:15,473
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

813
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:15,200
We need to eat him.

814
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:23,248
Leave him alone.

815
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:26,836
It's our only choice.

816
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,922
Like hell it is.

817
01:21:30,965 --> 01:21:32,050
We have to.

818
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,251
What are you doing?

819
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:09,754
I can't fucking see anything!

820
01:22:12,256 --> 01:22:14,882
I think I'm blind.
Jesus Christ.

821
01:22:14,884 --> 01:22:17,134
You have been sucking
alcohol wipes non-stop.

822
01:22:17,136 --> 01:22:20,137
- No wonder you're fucking blind.
- We need to find something to cut the flesh.

823
01:22:20,139 --> 01:22:22,056
Don't you fucking touch him!

824
01:22:22,058 --> 01:22:25,060
Stop acting hysterical!

825
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:57,551
Now none of you fucking witches
better try and stop me.

826
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:01,305
We gotta eat.

827
01:23:04,768 --> 01:23:06,895
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
is that?!

828
01:23:10,814 --> 01:23:14,357
What is that? What in the hell
is that?

829
01:23:39,844 --> 01:23:42,052
Oh, shit.

830
01:23:42,054 --> 01:23:44,723
I think I got it.

831
01:23:50,772 --> 01:23:51,773
Yes?

832
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:54,901
Of course.

833
01:23:57,862 --> 01:23:59,486
Yes.

834
01:24:00,823 --> 01:24:01,825
No.

835
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:12,834
I understand.

836
01:24:12,836 --> 01:24:13,837
Yes.

837
01:24:20,844 --> 01:24:22,427
What the fuck
are you doing?

838
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:24,180
What the fuck, Robert?

839
01:24:28,684 --> 01:24:31,103
It makes sense, doesn't it?

840
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:34,523
She's the one who started it.

841
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:37,609
So she's the only one
who can end it.

842
01:24:38,862 --> 01:24:42,031
What? Was that Amy?

843
01:24:45,577 --> 01:24:47,118
End this nightmare, you witch.

844
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,203
Witch!

845
01:24:49,205 --> 01:24:52,123
Witch, witch!

846
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:55,375
Kill the witch, kill the witch!

847
01:24:55,377 --> 01:24:57,003
Kill the witch!

848
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:58,170
Get away! Leave her alone!

849
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:01,257
Kill the witch. Kill the witch!

850
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:04,927
- Kill the witch!
- Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

851
01:26:10,077 --> 01:26:11,953
Kill the witch!

852
01:26:11,955 --> 01:26:16,960
Kill the witch!

853
01:27:46,882 --> 01:27:49,135
Have we always been here?

854
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:54,431
What?

855
01:28:01,063 --> 01:28:06,068
There's nothing
outside the door.

856
01:28:06,653 --> 01:28:09,614
There's nothing...

857
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:13,410
Nothing.

858
01:28:16,621 --> 01:28:17,622
Nothing.

859
01:30:00,308 --> 01:30:01,309
Okay...

860
01:30:04,269 --> 01:30:05,354
Okay, okay...

861
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,607
I'm gonna go out and see,
I'm just gonna...

862
01:30:10,609 --> 01:30:13,362
I'm just gonna see.
I'll be back.

863
01:31:22,431 --> 01:31:23,433
Mom?

864
01:31:25,225 --> 01:31:26,227
Mom?

865
01:31:28,438 --> 01:31:29,439
Mom?

866
01:31:32,317 --> 01:31:33,318
Mom?

867
01:31:35,487 --> 01:31:36,569
Mom?

868
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:49,539
Amy!

869
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:51,460
I used to cut myself.

870
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:16,234
- Melissa!
- Mom?

871
01:32:19,363 --> 01:32:22,698
Mom...
I saw Amy.

872
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,825
- I know. I know.
- I saw Amy.

873
01:32:24,827 --> 01:32:26,285
I know. I know.

874
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:27,869
I know.

875
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:30,124
Mom, what's outside?

876
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:33,001
Mom, what's outside?

877
01:32:34,837 --> 01:32:38,213
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

878
01:32:38,215 --> 01:32:39,714
It's gonna be okay.

879
01:32:39,716 --> 01:32:41,342
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

880
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,009
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna
be okay.

881
01:32:43,011 --> 01:32:45,096
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

882
01:32:45,098 --> 01:32:47,140
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

883
01:32:47,142 --> 01:32:49,142
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

884
01:32:49,144 --> 01:32:51,143
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

885
01:32:51,145 --> 01:32:53,396
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

886
01:32:53,398 --> 01:32:55,815
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

887
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:58,276
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

888
01:33:05,665 --> 01:33:09,828
