1
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:41,653
-天啊，为什么还没完?-等一下，好吗?
- God, why won't it stop? - Just give it a second, will you?

2
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:45,028
你在哪里?你应该在六点以前到家。
Where were you? You should have been home by six.

3
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,073
我告诉过你们今晚我要和艾米一起做作业。
I told you guys I was doing homework with Amy tonight.

4
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,575
那里发生了什么事?你受伤了吗?
What happened there? Did you hurt yourself?

5
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,785
艾米的猫抓伤了我。它很好。
Amy's, uh, cat scratched me. It's fine.

6
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,913
-没什么大不了的。-你为什么不接我电话?
- It's no big deal. - Why weren't you answering my calls?

7
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:57,668
我很抱歉，我只是…
Look I'm sorry, I just...

8
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,260
我想是ef5。
I think it's an ef5.

9
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,844
这不是龙卷风，宝贝。
It's not a tornado, baby.

10
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:11,012
-可能是ef5。- ef5到底是什么?
- It might be an ef5. - What the hell is an ef5?

11
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,558
就像当两个龙卷风相遇时，
It's like when two tornadoes come together,

12
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,434
形成了一个巨大的龙卷风。
and they form one giant tornado.

13
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,438
-它把路上的一切东西都撕碎了。-天啊，真的吗?
- It rips everything in its path. - God, is that true?

14
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,731
不，只是雷雨而已。一切都会没事的。
No, it's just a thunderstorm. Everything's gonna be okay.

15
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,028
天啊，太吵了。
Jesus, that was loud.

16
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,575
有点吵。
It was a little loud.

17
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,244
听起来像枪声。
Sounded like a gunshot.

18
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:35,036
也许是ef6。等待。
Maybe it's an ef6. Wait.

19
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,664
真的有ef6这样的东西吗?
Is there even such a thing as ef6?

20
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,957
宝贝，不会有龙卷风的。
Baby, there's not gonna be a tornado.

21
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,421
只是一场雷雨，很快就会过去的。
It's just a thunderstorm, and it's going to pass.

22
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,674
大多数事情都会结束的，不是吗?
Most things come to an end, don't they?

23
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,028
妈妈，我觉得有点不对劲。
Mom, I think something might be wrong.

24
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:09,362
就像风暴一样，一些糟糕的事情可能正在发生。
Like with the storm, something bad might be happening.

25
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,117
不,它会通过。
No, it'll pass.

26
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,584
谁想玩酒店大逃亡?
Who wants to play the great hotel escape?

27
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:23,919
-我们玩的时候你永远都看不懂牌。-我识字!
- You can never read the cards when we play that. - I can read!

28
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:26,005
-男人…-妈，告诉她我识字。
- Guys... - Mom, tell her I can read.

29
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:27,339
梅尔，你哥哥识字。
Mel, your brother can read.

30
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,633
看!我告诉你。
See! I told you.

31
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,385
-妈，你看到梅尔…!——够了!
- Mom, did you see what Mel...! - Enough!

32
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,549
- - - - - -那是谁?——没有人。
- Who's that? - Nobody.

33
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,551
正确的。
Right.

34
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,555
谁想扮演哥特人和破坏者?
Who wants to play goths and vandals?

35
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:18,474
-不是很棒的酒店逃亡吗?-现在不行，宝贝。
- Not the great hotel escape? - Not right now, baby.

36
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:22,102
听着，我们就玩哥特和破坏者的游戏。
Look we just pull out the goths and vandals game.

37
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:25,106
我打赌等我们过了第一轮，
I bet you by the time we get through the first round,

38
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,190
暴风雨会过去的。
the storm will've passed.

39
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,152
除非龙卷风把我们的房子卷走
Unless the tornado picks up our house

40
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:31,279
-然后把它带走之类的。- - - - - -闭嘴!
- and carries it away or something. - Shut up!

41
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,448
那只发生在《绿野仙踪》里。
That only happened in the wizard of oz.

42
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,366
这也可能发生在这里。
It could happen here too.

43
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,577
天啊，你真蠢。
God, you're so dumb.

44
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,039
我不是跟你说过不要那样跟你哥哥说话吗?
What did I tell you about talking to your brother like that?

45
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:43,417
对不起。
Sorry.

46
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,044
是吗?
Are you?

47
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,565
——是哪一位?-只是没人。
- Who's calling? - It's just nobody.

48
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,526
-是啊，谁打来的?——没有人!
- Yeah, who's calling? - Nobody!

49
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,195
哈!
Huh!

50
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:16,076
你真觉得这个厕所能保护我们吗
You really think this bathroom is gonna protect us

51
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,952
从一个巨大的，古老的龙卷风俯冲下来…
from a big, old tornado that swoops in and...

52
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,205
你真觉得这会有什么区别吗?
You really think it's gonna make any difference at all?

53
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,914
如果你不想和我们在一起，
Well if you don't wanna be in here with us,

54
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,418
-你知道门在哪。——哦!现在我有一个选择。
- you know where the door is. - Oh! Now I have a choice.

55
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,505
这是怎么回事?
What is going on?

56
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,813
嘘。没关系。没关系。
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

57
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,065
灯为什么灭了?
Why did the lights go out?

58
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,025
伙计们，这是雷雨，
You guys, it's a thunderstorm,

59
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:54,986
闪电可能击中了变压器之类的东西。
lightning probably hit a transformer or something.

60
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:56,823
不要无缘无故地惊慌失措。
Stop freaking out for no reason.

61
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,032
这是一个龙卷风!这是一个龙卷风!这是一个龙卷风!
It's a tornado! It's a tornado! It's a tornado!

62
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:02,413
鲍比?
Bobby?

63
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,755
闪电击中房子了吗?!
Did lightning hit the house?!

64
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:15,883
-那是什么鬼东西?天啊，那是什么?——耶稣基督。
- What the hell was that? Oh, god, what was that? - Jesus Christ.

65
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,805
我不知道。我不知道。
I don't know. I don't know.

66
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,058
爸爸不!不要去。
Dad no! Don't go.

67
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,728
把灯打开，好吗?
Just get the light, okay?

68
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,776
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

69
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:37,656
——怎么了?-打不开。
- What's wrong? - It won't open.

70
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,116
打不开是什么意思?
What do you mean it won't open?

71
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,620
我是说打不开!
I mean it won't fucking open!

72
00:07:44,748 --> 00:07:46,873
梅丽莎，把手机给我。
Melissa, give me your phone.

73
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,711
——没有。什么?为什么?-把电话给我
- No. What? Why? - Just give me the goddamn phone.

74
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,927
哦，搞什么?
Oh, what the fuck?

75
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,554
该死的!
God damn it!

76
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:03,683
-什么事?——树。
- What is it? - A tree.

77
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:07,310
——什么?-我想是棵该死的树
- A what? - I think a fucking tree

78
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,436
-挡住了门。-哦,上帝。
- is blocking the door. - Oh, god.

79
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,106
什么树?你不能移动它?
What tree? You can't move it?

80
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:15,445
我看起来能移动它吗?他妈的!
Does it look like I can move it? Fuck!

81
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,447
也许是后院的一棵树。
Maybe it's a tree from the backyard.

82
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,532
——什么?-我们埋的地方。
- What? - Where we buried spot.

83
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,325
- - - - - -什么? !——啊!
- What?! - Ugh!

84
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,578
妈的，梅尔。
God damn it, Mel.

85
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,748
-斑点死了吗?-我们一会儿再谈，好吗?
- Is spot dead? - Let's talk about this in a minute, okay?

86
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,876
但是小不点跑了!小不点跑了!
- But spot ran away! - Spot ran away!

87
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,421
该死的。
God damn it.

88
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,347
——耶稣基督。-我的手机呢?
- Jesus Christ. - Where's my phone?

89
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,015
——冷静下来。-爸爸，我的手机呢?
- Calm down. - Dad, where's my phone?

90
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,768
-我掉了。——啊!
- I dropped it. - Ugh!

91
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,895
你能不能别这么歇斯底里?这是一个风暴。
Would you stop being hysterical? It's a storm.

92
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:54,273
艾米很好。耶稣基督。
Amy is fine. Jesus Christ.

93
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,317
又不是世界末日。
It's not the end of the goddamn world.

94
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:04,786
梅尔!把门关上!
Mel! Shut the door!

95
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,579
把门关上!
Close the door!

96
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:20,844
-我们卡住了吗?-我不知道。屋顶不见了。
- Are we stuck? - I don't know. The roof is gone.

97
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,141
哦,我的上帝。到这里来。
Oh, my god. Come here.

98
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,731
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

99
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,543
我们得做点什么，不是吗?
We have to do something, don't we?

100
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:57,839
不是吗?
Don't we?

101
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:02,384
伙计们!
Guys!

102
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,979
我想我们还是等吧。
I guess we wait.

103
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:19,777
艾米……
Amy...

104
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:22,840
我还在等你停下呢，
Hey, I was waiting for you to stop,

105
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,049
看台后面?
back by the bleachers?

106
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,637
哦，对不起，我没看见你。
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

107
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:32,267
但你看到了别的东西，不是吗?
But you saw something else, didn't you?

108
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,190
-我很抱歉我不是故意的。-不是故意的?
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... - Didn't mean to what?

109
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,234
盯着看吗?
Stare?

110
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:44,988
也许我想让你这么做。
Maybe I wanted you to.

111
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:52,036
发生了什么事?
What happened?

112
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:55,165
我以前是个切割工。
I used to be a cutter.

113
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,797
为什么?
Why?

114
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,217
因为我曾经死了。
Because I used to be dead.

115
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,918
情况有多糟?这棵树吗?
How bad is it? The tree?

116
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:59,268
你认为保险公司会赔偿吗?
You think the insurance will cover it?

117
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,942
我不知道。
I don't know.

118
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,739
你要再打一次电话吗?
You gonna try your phone again?

119
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,662
等等，爸爸，我能用一下你的电话吗?打电话给艾米。
Wait, dad, can I use your phone? To call Amy.

120
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,249
它有问题。试一试你的。
Something's wrong with it. Try yours.

121
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:22,251
哦,我不能。
Oh, I can't.

122
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,214
——你不能?-是的，我不能。它死了。
- You can't? - Yeah, I can't. It's dead.

123
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,465
哦，该死的。
Oh, god damn it.

124
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,180
他妈的一坨屎。
Fucking piece of shit.

125
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,305
——嗯…——什么?
- Uh... - What?

126
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,683
我想看看新闻，
Well, I'm trying to check the news,

127
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,563
但这该死的东西不管用。
but this fucking thing isn't working.

128
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,689
好吧,嗯…你想让我看看吗?
Okay, well... do you want me to have a look at it?

129
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,026
不，我不想让你看。
No, I don't want you to have a look at it.

130
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:50,403
好吧。我只是问问。
Okay. I was just asking.

131
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,156
爸爸，我能试试你的手机吗?
Dad, can I please try your phone?

132
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:54,909
我要尿尿。
I have to pee.

133
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,433
我不能跟你们一起去。
I can't go with you guys here.

134
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,228
我不知道该跟你说什么，梅尔。
I don't know what to tell you, Mel.

135
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,861
我还能听到你尿尿的声音，妹妹。
I can still hear you pee, sis.

136
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:35,075
天啊，鲍比，天啊!
Oh, my god, Bobby, Jesus!

137
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,211
哇，真的是ef5。
Wow, it was really an ef5.

138
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,627
是的。可能是吧。
Yeah. It might have been.

139
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,172
你们觉得现在就结束了?
You guys think it's over now?

140
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:53,131
你觉得有人死了吗?
Do you think people died?

141
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,467
不，宝贝，没人死。
No, baby, nobody died.

142
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:55,552
这是非常可能的。
It's very possible.

143
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,721
严重吗?
Seriously?

144
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,726
嘿,你们!我看见一条蛇!
Hey, you guys! I see a snake!

145
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:08,313
- - - - - -什么? !鲍比，快离开那里。——在哪里?
- What?! Bobby get away from there. - Where?

146
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,859
在那边，梳妆台都被打碎了。
Over there, where the dressers all smashed.

147
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,196
我什么也没看到。
I don't see anything.

148
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,740
我想这是一条响尾蛇。
I think it's a rattlesnake.

149
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:20,367
你对响尾蛇了解多少?
What do you know about rattlesnakes?

150
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:21,954
在这里。
It's right there.

151
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,874
鲍比，没有蛇。
Bobby, there's no snake.

152
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:33,215
鲍比，进去，把门关上。
Bobby, get inside and shut the door.

153
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,469
谢谢你！
Thank you.

154
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:47,270
我曾经在YouTube上看到一条响尾蛇。
I saw a rattlesnake on YouTube once.

155
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:48,813
它正在吃鳄鱼。
It was eating an alligator.

156
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,356
什么?
What?

157
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:53,275
没有响尾蛇吃过短吻鳄。
No rattlesnake's ever eaten an alligator.

158
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:55,986
那是一只小鳄鱼。
It was a baby alligator.

159
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,448
那是只小鳄鱼，当然。
Oh, well it was a baby alligator, sure.

160
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,116
当然，这很有道理。
Of course, that makes perfect sense.

161
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,867
你以前应该告诉我的。
You should have mentioned that before.

162
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,578
我这辈子见过的蛇都是吃老鼠的
The only snakes that I ever met in my life eat mice

163
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,829
和其他狗屎。
and other shit.

164
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,334
-别那样看着我。-真不敢相信你把它掉了。
- Don't look at me like that. - Can't believe you dropped it.

165
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:54,002
这是一场意外。
It was an accident.

166
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,173
那我们现在要怎么离开这里?
Well, how are we supposed to get out of here now?

167
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,634
我不知道。
I don't know.

168
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:04,431
我们就不能把门砸开吗?那墙呢?
Can't we just break the door down? What about the wall?

169
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:08,391
——墙上?-墙，门还是别的什么。
- The wall? - The wall or the door or whatever.

170
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,439
你就不能在上面钻个洞爬出来吗?
Can't you just bust a hole through it and crawl out?

171
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:13,816
我们可以……
Can we just...

172
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,735
-我不…如何?与什么?-我不知道。
- I don't... how? With what? - I don't know.

173
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,111
你就不能打穿它吗?
Can't you just punch through it or something?

174
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,612
不，我不能打穿它。
No, I can't just punch through it.

175
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,534
那东西是橡木做的。
That thing is made of solid oak.

176
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,661
那是钢化玻璃砖。那是一堵石墙。
That is tempered glass blocks. That is a rock wall.

177
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:32,291
这是瓷砖。这些墙有六英尺厚。
This is tile. These walls are six feet thick.

178
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:35,002
我们他妈要怎么做?
How the fuck are we supposed to do that?

179
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,379
你想把手弄断吗?
You wanna break your hand?

180
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,130
——看,每个人都…-请便。
- Look, everyone... - Be my guest.

181
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:41,175
一切都会好的。没那么久。
Everything's going to be fine. It hasn't been that long.

182
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:43,052
有人会来。
Someone will come.

183
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:45,515
耶稣基督,盲目乐观。
Jesus Christ, pollyanna.

184
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:54,648
如果这不仅仅是一场风暴呢，妈妈?
What if it wasn't just a storm, mom?

185
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,433
外面有人吗?
Is there anybody out there?

186
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,086
-我们需要这个。——需要什么?
- We need that. - Need what?

187
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,507
我们需要它来保持水分。
We need it to stay hydrated.

188
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,261
但我还没看完呢。
But I'm not finished with it yet.

189
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,473
你能吗?
Well, can you be?

190
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,345
在这里,宝贝。
Here, baby.

191
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:52,473
-我洗掉了，别担心。——但是妈妈……
- I washed it out, don't worry. - But mom...

192
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:56,353
把水喝了吧，鲍比!只是喝!
Just drink the water, Bobby! Just drink it!

193
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:21,796
什么，我现在没有了吗?
What, I don't get any now?

194
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,341
别紧张，我只是随便玩玩。
Relax, I'm just fucking around.

195
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,679
有什么事吗?你开不起玩笑了吗?
What's the matter? You can't take a joke any more?

196
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,686
嘿，你为什么不冷静点?
Hey, why don't you just chill out?

197
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:40,479
嘿，我只是玩玩而已。
Hey, I'm just messing around.

198
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,189
别每次我说…
Don't overreact every time I say...

199
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,065
听着，该死的。
Listen, god damn it.

200
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,151
我们堆的东西已经够多了
We have enough shit piling up here

201
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:48,696
-没有你的体重。-你在说什么?
- without your weight added to it. - What are you talking about?

202
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,363
你很清楚我在说什么。
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

203
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,535
所以别突然装无辜了。
So don't try acting innocently all of a sudden.

204
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:57,537
-迪…-你想打架吗?很好。
- Dee... - Look, you wanna fight? Fine.

205
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,998
等这一切结束再说吧，因为现在，
Save it for when this is all over because right now,

206
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,293
没人想听。
nobody wants to hear it.

207
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,267
哇。
Whoa.

208
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,191
不。你有6 ?
No. You have a six?

209
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,444
是的。在这里。
Yeah. Here.

210
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,699
妈妈,我饿了。
Mom, I'm hungry.

211
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:35,828
是的,我也是。
Yeah, me too.

212
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:38,205
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

213
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,707
真希望我们带了金鱼饼干什么的。
I wish we'd brought some goldfish crackers with us or something.

214
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:45,002
啊!金鱼饼干真恶心。
Ugh! Goldfish crackers are disgusting.

215
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,548
嗯。对我来说更多。
Hmm. More for me then.

216
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:52,843
我想要一些鸡蛋。我要一千个鸡蛋。奶酪。
I want some eggs. I want a thousand eggs. With cheese.

217
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,389
-真恶心，只有老人才喜欢吃鸡蛋，鲍比。-不，他们没有。
- Gross, only old people like eggs, Bobby. - No, they don't.

218
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:58,850
妈妈，告诉姐姐所有人都喜欢鸡蛋。
Mom, tell sis all types of people like eggs.

219
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,936
梅丽莎，所有人都喜欢吃鸡蛋。
Melissa, all types of people like eggs.

220
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:04,354
Nuh-uh。只有老人。
Nuh-uh. Only old people.

221
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,358
你知道那意味着什么吗，鲍比?
And you know what that makes you, Bobby?

222
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,861
-别说了…-你知道那意味着什么吗?
- Don't say it... - You know what that makes you?

223
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:14,532
妈妈，告诉妹妹别这么说。
Mom, tell sis not to say it.

224
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,868
-梅丽莎，别说了——好吧,好吧。
- Melissa, don't say it. - Okay, okay.

225
00:22:20,957 --> 00:22:23,416
这让你看起来像个小老头。
It makes you a tiny, old man.

226
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:27,836
妈妈！
Mom!

227
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:30,299
冷静下来。没关系。
Calm down. It's okay.

228
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:36,680
-一个瘦小的老人。——愚蠢的混蛋。
- A tiny, old man. - Stupid asshole.

229
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:42,351
他妈的!他妈的!
Fuck! Fuck!

230
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:46,022
他妈的一坨屎!
Fucking piece of shit!

231
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,440
这该死的电池!
Stupid fucking battery!

232
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:51,777
你他妈的没用的混蛋科技!
You fucking useless asshole technology!

233
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,075
你他妈的婊子!去你妈的!
You fucking cunt! Fuck you!

234
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:59,534
你混蛋!去死吧，你这该死的婊子!
You motherfucker! Die, you fucking bitch!

235
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:03,083
你这笨蛋!去你妈的!
You stupid cunt! Fuck you!

236
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:07,796
操你的屁股!
Fuck you in your ass!

237
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:29,691
为什么还没有人来?
Why hasn't anybody come yet?

238
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,532
我不知道。
I don't know.

239
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,332
不是一个龙卷风。
Not a tornado.

240
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:49,837
别的东西。
Something else.

241
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:53,298
你的意思是……?
You mean...?

242
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:57,886
我认为……
I think...

243
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,353
我认为……
I think...

244
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:12,944
这没有任何意义。
It doesn't make any sense.

245
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:18,408
什么不合理?
What doesn't make any sense?

246
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:24,580
我们的邻居。有人已经来了。
We have neighbors. Someone would've come.

247
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:28,584
看到这棵树。
Seen the tree.

248
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,546
为什么没有呢，爸爸?
Why haven't they, daddy?

249
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:35,967
他们都死了。
They're all dead.

250
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:38,719
你为什么这么说?
Why would you say that?

251
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:45,852
或者他们已经被疏散了。
Or they've already been evacuated.

252
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:52,859
不管怎样，这对我们来说都不是好兆头。
Either way, it doesn't bode too well for any of us.

253
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,032
我曾经死了。
I used to be dead.

254
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:48,789
大多数人。他们只是没有意识到。
Most people are. They just don't realize it.

255
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:51,834
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

256
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:59,217
他们说我疯了。我这么做是为了引起注意。
They said I was crazy. That I did it for attention.

257
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,596
你听说过胆小鬼妄想吗?
You ever heard of cotard delusion?

258
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,266
不，我不这么认为。
No, I don't think so.

259
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,561
骨瘦如柴的综合症。
Walking corpse syndrome.

260
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:15,108
我想这就像一种精神疾病。
It's like a mental illness, I guess.

261
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,487
人们开始相信他们真的死了。
People become convinced that they're actually really dead.

262
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,376
这就是你以前割自己的原因吗?
Is that why you used to cut yourself?

263
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:40,633
如果我还能流血，也许我就能提醒自己那不是真的，
If I could still bleed, then maybe I could remind myself that it wasn't real,

264
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:43,553
我还活着
that I was still alive.

265
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:50,392
你想成为吗?
Did you want to be?

266
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:57,150
当你割伤自己的时候，你希望看到什么?
When you would cut yourself, what were you hoping to see?

267
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,034
梅那看起来像是被感染了
Mel, that's starting to look infected.

268
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,495
它很好。
It's fine.

269
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:55,372
我在上面放点东西，好吗?
I'm gonna put something on it, okay?

270
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,376
妈妈，爸爸，我饿了。
Mom, dad, I'm hungry.

271
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:00,588
好吧，我不知道该说什么。
Okay, I don't know what to say about that.

272
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,925
我要一个火腿芝士煎蛋卷。
I want an omelet with ham and cheese.

273
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:08,888
但是娘娘腔没有奶酪，听到了吗，姐姐?
But sissy doesn't get any cheese, you hear that, sis?

274
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:12,348
哦,我的上帝。哦,我的上帝。什么，什么，什么，什么?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What, what, what, what?

275
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,932
我的天，我的天，我的天，我的天，我的天!
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!

276
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:15,685
鲍比，你待在那里。
Bobby, you stay there.

277
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:17,352
-这他妈…——哦,耶稣。什么?
- What the f... - Oh, Jesus. What?

278
00:28:19,274 --> 00:28:22,190
-鲍比，到浴缸里去!-我的天啊!
- Bobby, get in the tub! - Oh, my god!

279
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:25,529
——好吧,好吧。呆在那里。呆在那里。-我的天啊。
- Okay, okay. Stay there. Stay there. - Oh, my god.

280
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,449
狗屎!
Shit!

281
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,658
哦,我的上帝。我的天，我的天，我的天!
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!

282
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,159
好吧。好吧，我去找你。等一等。
Okay. Okay, I'm coming to you. Hold on.

283
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,245
-我的天啊。-罗伯特…
- Oh, my god. - Robert...

284
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:36,456
妈的，妈的，妈的，妈的，妈的。
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

285
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:40,042
-我的天啊。他妈的什么?-我该怎么办?我该怎么办?
- Oh, my god. What the fuck? - What do I do? What do I do?

286
00:28:40,044 --> 00:28:41,627
只是不动。
Just don't move.

287
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:43,254
耶稣!
Jesus!

288
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,716
-我的天啊!——基督!
- Oh, my god! - Christ!

289
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:49,217
-它咬你了吗?-不，我不这么认为。
- Did it bite you? - No, I don't think so.

290
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:50,220
好吧。
Okay.

291
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,679
爸爸小心些而已。
Dad be careful.

292
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,515
哦,狗屎。罗伯特，你还好吗?
Oh, shit. Robert, are you okay?

293
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,898
梅尔，把活塞扔给我。
Mel, throw me that plunger.

294
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:02,189
梅尔,小心。
Mel, careful.

295
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:04,399
妈的,我很抱歉。他妈的。
Shit, I'm sorry. Fuck.

296
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:07,736
——耶稣,耶稣。-该死，该死，该死。
- Jesus, Jesus. - Shit, shit, shit.

297
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:09,406
好吧。好吧。
Okay. Okay.

298
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,408
它会咬你的!
It's gonna bite you!

299
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:15,745
-爸爸，它会咬你的。-你在干什么?
- Dad, it's gonna bite you. - What are you doing?

300
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:19,082
-我的天啊!-我的天啊!哦,我的上帝!
- Oh, my god! - Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

301
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,542
小心些而已。别这样，会加重病情的。
Be careful. Stop, it's gonna aggravate it.

302
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:23,294
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my god!

303
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:25,338
——罗伯特!——爸爸,停!
- Robert! - Dad, stop!

304
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,465
——走开!——罗伯特!
- Go away! - Robert!

305
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:30,178
他妈的……
Fuck...

306
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,558
去你妈的,蛇!
Fuck you, snake!

307
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,854
-不见了吗?-我他妈要把你全家都吃了。
- Is it gone? - I'll fucking eat your whole fucking family.

308
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,510
是啊!
Yeah!

309
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:22,272
等一下…
Wait a minute...

310
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,450
我们应该吃掉它吗?
Should we have eaten it?

311
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,830
——恶心。不。-蛇加奶酪!奶酪加额外的蛇!
- Gross. No. - Snakes with extra cheese! Cheese with extra snakes!

312
00:30:40,832 --> 00:30:42,917
我不知道怎么吃蛇，你呢?
I don't know how to eat a snake, do you?

313
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:47,044
是的，你只要把它捡起来
Yeah, you just pick it up

314
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,090
然后把脑袋咬下来，像奥兹一样。
and bite the head off, like ozzy.

315
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,383
那不是一只蝙蝠吗?
Wasn't that a bat?

316
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:56,638
蛇就是不会飞的蝙蝠。
Snakes are just bats that can't fly.

317
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,601
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

318
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,537
再告诉我。
Tell me again.

319
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,666
告诉你吧，宝贝?
Tell you what, baby?

320
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:28,671
你知道。好吗?
You know what. Please?

321
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:34,719
好吧。你想让我从哪里开始?
Okay. Where do you want me to start?

322
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:39,554
告诉我你有多胖，妈妈。
Tell me about how big and fat you were, mom.

323
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:42,684
嘿。
Hey.

324
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:47,479
我看起来像是在走私
It looked like I was smuggling

325
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:53,361
我的衬衫下面有一个巨大的西瓜，
a big, gigantic watermelon underneath my shirt,

326
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:58,157
但那下面只有你。
but all that was under there was you.

327
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,498
我说"耐心点，宝贝。我需要你有耐心。”
I was saying, "Patience, baby. I need you to have Patience."

328
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:07,291
因为你当时还没去医院。
Because you weren't at the hospital yet.

329
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,670
你在沃尔玛。
You were at a Walmart.

330
00:32:10,337 --> 00:32:11,338
这是正确的。
That's right.

331
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:16,676
你和娘娘腔。但是娘娘腔是我的年龄。
You and sissy. But sissy was my age.

332
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:19,469
不，娘娘腔更年轻一点，但没错，
No, sissy was a little bit younger, but yes,

333
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:23,142
娘娘腔是……和我们在一起。
sissy was... was there with us.

334
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:26,395
你在买什么?
What were you buying?

335
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:30,898
一个披萨,因为?
A pizza, because?

336
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,066
你厌倦了一直做饭。
You were tired of cooking all the time.

337
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:35,319
哦。是的,这是正确的。
Oh. Yes, that's right.

338
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:38,908
我怀孕九个月了，非常疲惫。
I was nine months pregnant, and I was exhausted.

339
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:45,832
爸爸在哪里呢?
Where was dad?

340
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,296
我不记得了。
I don't remember.

341
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,674
爸爸，我出生的时候你在哪里?
Dad, where were you when I was born?

342
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,092
他在保龄球馆喝醉了。
He was drunk at a bowling alley.

343
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:00,764
不,不喜欢。
No, don't.

344
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,065
妈妈,我累了。
Mommy, I'm tired.

345
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:17,446
只要闭上你的眼睛，宝贝。
Just close your eyes baby.

346
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:22,074
我累了，妈妈，我累了。
I'm tired, mommy, I'm tired.

347
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:38,218
是的…我也累了。
Yeah... I'm tired too.

348
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:06,871
-什么事?-嘘…
- What is it? - Shh...

349
00:34:28,308 --> 00:34:30,976
-我想是只狗。——一只狗?
- I think it's a dog. - A dog?

350
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:32,228
——等待。-我的天啊。
- Wait. - Oh, my god.

351
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,353
——鲍比!——鲍比!该死的!
- Bobby! - Bobby! God damn it!

352
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:34,357
不,不!
No, don't!

353
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:39,529
他在舔我的手，伙计们。
He's licking my hand, you guys.

354
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:43,029
谁是好孩子?谁是好孩子?
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

355
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,074
你是，你是。
You are, you are.

356
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,909
等等，那真的是狗吗?
Wait, is that actually a dog?

357
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:48,955
是的,检查。
Yeah, check.

358
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,335
哦,我的上帝。这是……它实际上是一只狗。
Oh, my god. It's... it's actually a dog.

359
00:34:57,337 --> 00:34:59,004
——是吗?-好吧，小心点
- Is it? - All right, well, be careful.

360
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:01,632
你不知道那东西有多烂。
You don't know what kind of shit that thing has.

361
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,761
你认为是斑点吗?我想是斑点。
Do you think it's spot? I think it's spot.

362
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,888
小不点，是你吗?是的，不是吗?
Spot, is that you boy? It is, isn't it?

363
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,600
大家都说你被埋在后院了。但事实并非如此，对吧?
Everybody said you're buried in the backyard. But that isn't true, right?

364
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:14,270
你刚跑掉，现在又来救我们。
You just ran away and now you've come to save us.

365
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:16,815
谁是好孩子?谁是好孩子?
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

366
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:19,400
我是个好孩子!
I'm a good boy!

367
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:25,323
哦,我的上帝!的帮助!的帮助!
Oh, my god! Help! Help!

368
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:28,828
哦,我的上帝!的帮助!哦,我的上帝!的帮助!
Oh, my god! Help! Oh, my god! Help!

369
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:32,788
的帮助!哦,我的上帝!
Help! Oh, my god!

370
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,540
它为什么会说话?它为什么会说话?
Why did it talk? Why did it talk?

371
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,917
放了我女儿，我他妈的杀了你!
Let my daughter go, I'll fucking kill you!

372
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:41,254
天啊，救救我!
Oh, my god, help me!

373
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:44,341
我要杀了你!
I'll kill you!

374
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,636
梅尔!
Mel!

375
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:52,683
我很抱歉，我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

376
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:06,783
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

377
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:36,103
天呐
Holy shit.

378
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,768
他要是回来，我就打烂他的脑袋。
He comes back, I'll break his goddamn skull.

379
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,190
大多数东西不是舌头被扯掉就死了吗?
Don't most things die with their tongues ripped out?

380
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:25,402
我看起来像什么?什么他妈的医生?
What do I look like? Some kind of fucking doctor?

381
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:29,990
我们至少得试一试，对吧?
Well, we at least need to try, right?

382
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:31,910
试着什么?
Try what?

383
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
我们还没有吃。
We haven't eaten.

384
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,251
梅尔，你真是个变态。
Mel, you're one sick fuck.

385
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:45,504
在这里。
Here.

386
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:47,966
妈妈，我也要吃舌头吗?
Mom, do I have to eat the tongue, too?

387
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,346
是的,宝贝。
Yes, baby.

388
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:56,473
好吧，我们得一小口一小口地吃
Okay, we have to eat this in tiny bites

389
00:37:56,475 --> 00:38:00,685
因为它很难咀嚼，但很容易窒息，
because it'll be tough to chew but easy to choke on,

390
00:38:00,687 --> 00:38:01,939
所以我们必须小心。
so we have to be careful.

391
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:04,899
再在这里待一天，我可能会被咬一口
One more day in here I'd probably take a chomp

392
00:38:04,901 --> 00:38:07,025
从那个变态的老二里。
out of that creep's dick.

393
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,527
这是恶心。
That's disgusting.

394
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:11,321
是啊，鸡巴是用来尿尿的，不是用来吃东西的，爸爸。
Yeah, dicks are for peeing, not eating, dad.

395
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:21,540
好吧，我先试试。
Well, I'll try it first.

396
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,585
是我发现的，对吧?
I'm the one who caught it, right?

397
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:37,015
啊!
Ah!

398
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:39,766
你还好吗?
Oh, are you okay?

399
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:48,942
-再给我一杯。-你确定?
- Give me another. - You sure?

400
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:51,321
是的，你们所有人。我们需要吃东西。
Yeah, all of you. We need to eat.

401
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:04,728
怎么一切都搞砸了?
How did everything get so fucked up?

402
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,317
你知道发生了什么。
You know what happened.

403
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,822
你很清楚发生了什么。
You know exactly what happened.

404
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:18,118
真实的。
True.

405
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:21,996
乔。
Joe.

406
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:35,634
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

407
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:40,013
我的天，给我滚出去!
My god, get the fuck out of here!

408
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:42,267
滚，你这个变态。
Go, you fucking creep.

409
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:50,105
-我很抱歉——这很好。
- I'm so sorry. - It's fine.

410
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:51,399
我到哪儿他就跟到哪儿。
He follows me everywhere.

411
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,986
是啊，真是个蠢蛋。
Yeah, what a fucking dunce.

412
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,996
他为什么就不能接受暗示呢?
Why couldn't he just take a fucking hint?

413
00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:12,379
回想起来，我们不应该对他的所作所为感到惊讶。
In retrospect, we shouldn't be surprised at what he did.

414
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:15,632
不。
No.

415
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,812
你什么都不用说。
You don't have to say anything.

416
00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:33,901
你怎么想，我就怎么想。
Anything you think, I think.

417
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:37,739
如何?
How?

418
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:46,161
我不明白发生了什么事。
I don't understand what's happening.

419
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:47,998
没人要你这么做。
No one's asking you to.

420
00:41:52,712 --> 00:41:57,801
我们得做点什么，别再胡说八道了，对吧?
We had to do something to stop from talking shit, right?

421
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,219
我们不得不。
We had to.

422
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:25,620
帮我个忙?
Give me a hand?

423
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:32,794
对不起,现货。
Sorry, spot.

424
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:40,802
啊。
Ugh.

425
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,105
这个咒语应该很简单。
The spell should be pretty simple.

426
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:56,732
黑帮总是这么做。
The mob does it all the time.

427
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:57,734
暴徒吗?
The mob?

428
00:42:58,486 --> 00:43:00,319
它能让人们不再说你的坏话。
It convinces people to stop talking shit about you.

429
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,071
给他们一个严厉的警告，告诉他们你不是什么大人物
Gives them a stern warning that you aren't someone

430
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:03,199
被人玩弄。
to be fucked with.

431
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:07,828
所以，给这混蛋一个警告，好吗?
So, let's give this motherfucker a warning, shall we?

432
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,053
马上就到。
Back to you in a second.

433
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:37,858
我想他的全名是约瑟夫。
I think his full name is Joseph.

434
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:40,611
我不确定这有多重要。
I'm not sure it matters that much.

435
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:03,093
抱歉，是我妈。
Sorry, it's just my mom.

436
00:44:37,627 --> 00:44:41,089
这样的话，他说的任何关于我的话都会变成针对他的。
This way, anything he tries to say about me will be turned against him.

437
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:07,529
-我爱你…——嘘。
- I love you... - Shh.

438
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:15,123
我也爱你。
I love you too.

439
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:22,254

没有，我什么也没看到。

567
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,573
但我觉得我们应该把门关上一段时间。
But I think we should keep the door closed for a little while.

568
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,538
但是鲍比呢?
But what about Bobby?

569

Okay, I think we can talk again.

572
00:57:11,714 --> 00:57:14,676
但我们还是要注意量，以防万一。
But we should still watch our volumes, just in case.

573
00:57:16,468 --> 00:57:17,469
万一什么?
In case of what?

574

我不知道。
I don't know.

576
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,245
真的有人向他开枪了吗?
Did someone really shoot that guy?

577
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,290
也许他在射击什么东西。
Maybe he was shooting something.

578
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:51,838

00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:08,896
你以为我不知道吗?
You think I don't know that?

584
00:58:13,442 --> 00:58:14,736
咬一口会杀了他吗?
Can that bite kill him?

585
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:21,618
我想我把所有东西都吸出来了。我不…我不知道。
I think I sucked everything out. I don't... I don't know.

586
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:28,500
天啊，到底发生了什么?
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?

587
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:34,422
我很害怕。
I'm scared.

588
00:58:37,926 --> 00:58:38,968
我也是,亲爱的。
Me too, sweetheart.

589
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,269
我们该怎么办?
What should we do?

590
00:58:54,274 --> 00:58:58,445
伙计们，我们该怎么办?
Guys, what should we do?

591
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:02,616
梅尔，你他妈为什么一直问我们该怎么办!
Mel, why the fuck do you keep asking us what should we do?!

592
00:59:03,535 --> 00:59:05,618
你知道的我们都知道。
We know exactly what you know.

593
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,496
这他妈没什么，好吗?好吧?
Which is fucking nothing, okay? Okay?

594
00:59:09,498 --> 00:59:10,500
是的。
Yeah.

595
00:59:16,506 --> 00:59:18,049
好吧,我很抱歉。
Okay, I'm sorry.

596
00:59:24,138 --> 00:59:25,765
我不知道我们该怎么办。
I don't know what we're gonna do.

597
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:29,100
我不知道外面发生了什么。
I don't know what happened out there.

598
00:59:29,102 --> 00:59:31,895
我不知道谁杀了谁。我不知道他们为什么要杀他。
I don't know who shot who. I don't know why they shot him.

599
00:59:32,939 --> 00:59:36,607
我不知道我们还能不能走出这间浴室去寻找答案。
I don't know if we're ever gonna get out of this bathroom to find out.

600
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:38,486
我都不知道我想不想知道。
I don't even know if I wanna find out.

601
00:59:41,364 --> 00:59:43,533
我不知道鲍比会不会没事。
I don't know if Bobby's gonna be okay.

602
00:59:46,995 --> 00:59:50,498
我现在什么都不知道。
I don't know goddamn much about anything right now.

603
01:00:17,192 --> 01:00:18,732
我们杀了他。
We killed him.

604
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:20,650
我知道。我们混乱的。
I know. We fucked up.

605
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:21,654
我们吗?
We?

606
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:26,868
我们是一条船上的，不是吗?
We're in this together, aren't we?

607
01:00:29,703 --> 01:00:31,247
是的，我们是一条船上的。
Yeah, we're in this together.

608
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,832
谢谢你没有抛弃我。
Thank you for not abandoning me.

609
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:38,129
我不会的，好吗?
Hey, I would never, okay?

610
01:00:43,384 --> 01:00:44,761
这是一个巫术咒语。
It was a necromancy spell.

611
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:50,933
-我们用在乔身上的那个?-不，梅勒妮，不是乔。我，我把它用在了自己身上。
- That we used on Joe? - No, melly, not Joe. Me, I used it on myself.

612
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:55,939
我告诉过你我死了，至少我以为我死了。
I told you I was dead, or at least I thought I was dead.

613
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:58,483
如何?
How?

614
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:01,859
这很复杂，现在开始讲细节，
It's complicated, and getting into the details now,

615
01:01:01,861 --> 01:01:03,527
那并不重要。对吧?
it's not important. Right?

616
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,112
重点是，这种特殊的咒语
The point is this, that specific kind of spell

617
01:01:05,114 --> 01:01:06,906
是用来让人起死回生的。
is supposed to bring back people from the dead.

618
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:08,866
我的内心已经死了。
And something inside of me was dead.

619
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:10,451
所以它只在理论上有意义
So it only makes sense theoretically

620
01:01:10,453 --> 01:01:13,413
它可以…是可行的。
that it could... would work.

621
01:01:13,415 --> 01:01:14,416
干的?
Did it?

622
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,377
我，我以为我好多了，我痊愈了。
I, I thought I was better, that I was healed.

623
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:21,045
好吧,你呢?
Well, are you?

624
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:24,005
我这几天一直觉得不舒服。
I haven't felt right in the past couple of days.

625
01:01:24,007 --> 01:01:26,801
我还以为是乔给我的那些假情色的屁话。
And I thought maybe it was all the deepfake porno bullshit Joe pulled on me.

626
01:01:26,803 --> 01:01:28,680
但现在我怀疑是别的原因。
But now I suspect it's something else.

627
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:31,140
一些更邪恶的东西。
Something a little more evil.

628
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:33,891
艾米，你说什么都没用。
Amy, you're not making any sense.

629
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:36,810
如果一直以来死去的不是我呢?
What if it wasn't me who was dead all this time?

630
01:01:36,812 --> 01:01:40,063
如果我体内有什么东西死了呢?
What if something was inside me and that's what was dead?

631
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:43,859
我施了咒语，它就醒了吗?
And when I performed the spell, it woke up?

632
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:47,196
——艾米,我…-一直在等一个完美的时刻
- Amy, I... - It's just been waiting for the perfect moment

633
01:01:47,198 --> 01:01:48,450
来宣布它的到来。
to announce its arrival.

634
01:01:52,453 --> 01:01:56,413
-我不认为…-这就是为什么舌头拼错的原因。
- I don't think... - It has to be why the tongue spell went so wrong.

635
01:01:56,415 --> 01:01:58,583
我是说，我知道我们把牛的舌头换成了狗的舌头，
I mean, I know we substituted a dog's tongue for a cow's,

636
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:01,835
但我的意思是，天哪，发生的事本不该发生。
but still, I mean, holy shit, what happened shouldn't have happened.

637
01:02:01,837 --> 01:02:06,214
除非主持仪式的人心里藏着什么东西。
Unless the person who conducted the ritual had something hiding inside of them.

638
01:02:06,216 --> 01:02:10,051
超出人类的东西。某物
Something beyond human. Something...

639
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:11,221
一些什么?
Something what?

640
01:02:13,515 --> 01:02:14,683
恶魔的东西。
Something diabolical.

641
01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:39,834
他怎么还没去看你?
Why hasn't he checked on you yet?

642
01:02:52,721 --> 01:02:56,891
-为什么没有…——迪。不玩聋。
- Why hasn't who... - Dee. Don't play deaf.

643
01:02:56,893 --> 01:03:01,606
我知道你听到了。你不觉得他担心吗?
I know you hear me. Don't you think he's worried?

644
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:08,028
我觉得现在谈这个不太合适。
I really don't think now is the best time to talk about this.

645
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:14,786
我不是想当混蛋，该死的。
I'm not trying to be an asshole, god damn it.

646
01:03:16,913 --> 01:03:21,373
我只是想说我们得离开这里
I'm just saying we need to get out of here

647
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,292
或者我们受骗的。
or we're fucked.

648
01:03:23,294 --> 01:03:24,504
特别是现在。
Especially now.

649
01:03:25,672 --> 01:03:27,507
你们在说谁?
Who are you guys talking about?

650
01:03:30,384 --> 01:03:32,594
没关系,宝贝。没关系。我知道。
It's okay, baby. It's okay. I know.

651
01:03:33,805 --> 01:03:34,806
好吗?
Well?

652
01:03:39,935 --> 01:03:41,478
我跟他说如果他不…
I told him if he didn't...

653
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:44,897
他半夜还没收到我的消息，
He didn't hear from me by midnight,

654
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:48,152
那么可能发生了什么事。
then something might have happened.

655
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:54,576
像什么?
Something like what?

656
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,123
我们真的不应该谈这个。
We really shouldn't get into this.

657
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,252
不好意思，来的不是时候吗?
Oh, I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

658
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:13,594
我不知道你会有什么反应。我很害怕。
I didn't know how you'd react. I was scared.

659
01:04:15,053 --> 01:04:16,055
害怕什么?
Scared of what?

660
01:04:19,975 --> 01:04:21,558
的你。
Of you.

661
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,439
你以为我会怎么做?伤害你吗?
What'd you think I'd do? Hurt you?

662
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:32,737
——也许。-我的天啊我伤害过你吗?
- Maybe. - Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Have I ever hurt you?

663
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:34,199
不要忽略我。
Stop ignoring me.

664
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,283
你们他妈的在说什么?
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

665
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:41,788
我给过你很多机会。
I gave you chances, plenty of chances.

666
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,540
我给了你很多年的机会。
I gave you years and years of chances.

667
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:47,542
年?你想谈谈岁月吗?
Years? You wanna talk about years?

668
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:49,920
我会跟你说他妈的几年。
I'll talk to you about fucking years.

669
01:04:49,922 --> 01:04:52,130
你他妈整天都在说几年的事。
Talk about years all fucking day long.

670
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:54,716
你觉得你能离开这里吗?
You think you're ever getting out of here?

671
01:04:54,718 --> 01:04:56,551
你觉得我们能走路吗
You think any of us is ever gonna walk

672
01:04:56,553 --> 01:04:58,804
-又从这扇门出去?——这就够了!
- out of this door again? - That's enough!

673
01:04:58,806 --> 01:04:59,808
你最…!
You're the most...!

674
01:05:01,225 --> 01:05:05,185
你是我这辈子见过的最痴心妄想的贱人!
You're the most delusional bitch I've ever met in my entire life!

675
01:05:05,187 --> 01:05:07,522
-妈妈…-别吵了。请停止战斗。
- Mom... - Please stop fighting. Please stop fighting.

676
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:09,776
你又吓到孩子了，亲爱的。
You're scaring the kids again, dear.

677
01:05:12,236 --> 01:05:16,239
妈妈。
Mommy.

678
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:18,366
很疼，全身都在燃烧。
It hurts, everything burns.

679
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:20,036
所有的烧伤。
Everything burns.

680
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:24,165
他的心跳……
His heartbeat...

681
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:27,708
鲍比，你他妈的冷静点。
Bobby, you gotta calm the fuck down.

682
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,252
你他妈给我冷静下来。
You gotta calm the fuck down right now.

683
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:32,672
-好吧，那没用-你他妈的想让我做什么?
- Okay, that isn't helping. - What the fuck do you want me to do?

684
01:05:32,674 --> 01:05:34,297
我不知道。不是。
I don't know. Just not that.

685
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:41,931
好吧,宝贝。好了，宝贝，没事了。
Okay, baby. Okay, baby, it's okay.

686
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:47,937
我要你好好深呼吸，好吗?
I want you to take nice, deep breaths, okay?

687
01:05:47,939 --> 01:05:50,897
好吧，和我一起做。
Okay, do it with me.

688
01:05:50,899 --> 01:05:52,526
深呼吸。
Deep breath.

689
01:05:55,321 --> 01:05:58,448
很容易。很容易。
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

690
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,324
这很好。这很好。
That's good. That's good.

691
01:06:01,326 --> 01:06:04,120
这很好。这很好。
That's good. That's good.

692
01:06:04,122 --> 01:06:08,040
妈妈，再告诉我一次。
Mom, tell me again.

693
01:06:11,337 --> 01:06:13,214
告诉你吧，宝贝?
Tell you what, baby?

694
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:17,926
你知道的,请。
You know, please.

695
01:06:19,094 --> 01:06:21,430
我们想买个冷冻披萨，
We were trying to buy a frozen pizza,

696
01:06:23,056 --> 01:06:26,308
你觉得你在我肚子里待得够久了。
and you decided you had been in my belly long enough.

697
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:31,188
你又大又胖的肚子。
Your big, fat belly.

698
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:35,484
像一个西瓜。
Like a watermelon.

699
01:06:37,404 --> 01:06:38,489
和我…
And I...

700
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:45,786
我走不动了，我只是…
I couldn't walk anymore and I was just...

701
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:53,671
很疼，而且你踢我很用力。
It hurt so badly and you were kicking me so hard.

702
01:06:57,299 --> 01:07:01,678
他们叫救护车了吗?
Did they call an ambulance?

703
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:03,515
他们确定了。
They sure did.

704
01:07:05,933 --> 01:07:08,018
在我们等救护车的时候，
And while we were waiting for the ambulance,

705
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:16,276
茜茜坐在我旁边，握着我的手。
sissy sat down next to me and held my hand.

706
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,198
她看着我说，
And she looked at me and she said,

707
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,368
“一切都会好起来的。”
"everything's gonna be okay."

708
01:07:27,205 --> 01:07:30,667
你只需要勇敢一点，再多等一会儿。
You just have to be brave and wait little bit longer.

709
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:38,091
“不会有什么坏事发生的。一切都会解决的。”
"Nothing bad is gonna happen. And everything will work out."

710
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:45,140
你知道吗，宝贝?她是对的。
And you know what, baby? She was right.

711
01:07:47,725 --> 01:07:51,103
她帮助我变得勇敢和坚强。
She helped me be brave and strong.

712
01:07:52,522 --> 01:07:55,188
我们等着救护车来。
And we waited for the ambulance to come.

713
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:58,109
当他们来的时候，他们把你从我身上拖了出来。
And when they came, they pulled you out of me.

714
01:07:58,111 --> 01:08:01,112
就在那里，冷冻食品区那层。
Right there, on the frozen food section floor.

715
01:08:05,076 --> 01:08:08,830
所以我知道你会没事的。
And that's why I know you're gonna be okay.

716
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:12,915
娘娘腔也会没事的。
And sissy's gonna be okay.

717
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:17,169
一切都会好起来的，会有人来的。
And everything's gonna be okay and someone's gonna come.

718
01:08:17,171 --> 01:08:21,132
有人会来把那棵树移开，然后打开那扇门。
Someone's gonna come and move that tree and open that door.

719
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:24,552
所有人都会在外面等着。
And everyone will be waiting outside.

720
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:25,930
这样生活就会更好。
And life will be better.

721
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:30,016
一切都会好起来的。
And everything will be okay.

722
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:32,727
你只要再坚持一会儿，好吗，宝贝?
You just have to hold on a little bit longer, okay, baby?

723
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:37,397
只要再坚持一段时间。好吧?
Just have to hold on a little bit longer. Okay?

724
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:38,817
只是信任…
Just trust...

725
01:09:16,022 --> 01:09:17,649
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

726
01:09:23,237 --> 01:09:28,200
不!宝贝!
No! Baby!

727
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:30,745
我的宝贝，来吧!
My baby boy, come on!

728
01:09:31,996 --> 01:09:36,000
不，我们只需要再等一会儿!请。
No, we just have to wait a little longer! Please.

729
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:37,644
你从哪儿弄来的?
Where did you get this?

730
01:10:39,563 --> 01:10:41,732
有些秘密是不该被揭露的。
Some secrets aren't meant to be revealed.

731
01:11:04,171 --> 01:11:07,466
现在我。
Now me.

732
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:09,469
让我流血。
Make me bleed.

733
01:11:24,024 --> 01:11:25,859
你无法解决不可避免的事情。
You can't fix the inevitable.

734
01:11:54,889 --> 01:11:56,015
他妈的。
Fuck.

735
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:30,841
天啊，为什么还没完?
God, why won't it stop?

736
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,972
等等，鲍比在哪儿?
Wait, where's, where's Bobby?

737
01:12:41,935 --> 01:12:43,188
他一直在的地方，宝贝。
Where he's always been, baby.

738
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:54,698
妈妈，我胃疼。
Mom, my stomach hurts.

739
01:12:59,203 --> 01:13:01,038
你为什么不接我电话?
Why weren't you answering my calls?

740
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:08,045
我…我感觉不舒服。我认为……我觉得我体内有某种东西。
I... I don't feel good. I think... I think there's something inside me.

741
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:11,131
我们都会因为你而死。
We're all gonna die because of you.

742
01:13:12,884 --> 01:13:16,552
——什么?-你不知道你自己的女儿是个女巫?
- What? - You didn't know your own daughter was a witch?

743
01:13:16,554 --> 01:13:18,348
你真他妈的是个好妈妈。
Some fucking mother you are.

744
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:22,933
-是真的吗，梅尔?-请帮帮我。
- Is that true, Mel? - Please, help me.

745
01:13:22,935 --> 01:13:24,938
不喜欢。这是一个陷阱。
Don't. It's a trap.

746
01:13:25,979 --> 01:13:27,771
她的一个女巫陷阱。
One of her witch traps.

747
01:13:27,773 --> 01:13:30,816
你想帮她，她就会骂你。
You try to help her and she'll curse you.

748
01:13:30,818 --> 01:13:32,903
不，有点不对劲。
No, something is wrong.

749
01:13:38,952 --> 01:13:41,204
给我点时间，好吗?
Just give me a second, will you?

750
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,392
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

751
01:14:05,854 --> 01:14:07,063
你觉得呢?
Where do you think?

752
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:11,567
哦,上帝。
Oh, god.

753
01:14:20,827 --> 01:14:22,660
耶稣基督。
Jesus Christ.

754
01:14:22,662 --> 01:14:24,330
妈的，我怎么了?
Fuck, what's wrong with me?

755
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:33,005
在那之后，你…你把这些都喝了。
After what happened, you... You drank this, all of it.

756
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:41,389
你都不能给我留点，对吧?
And you couldn't even leave any for me, could you?

757
01:14:44,184 --> 01:14:46,019
后……之后发生了什么事?
After... after what happened?

758
01:16:41,925 --> 01:16:43,343
这都是我的错。
This is all my fault.

759
01:16:49,309 --> 01:16:50,432
什么?
What?

760
01:16:50,434 --> 01:16:52,269
这一切都是因为我。
All of this is because of me.

761
01:16:53,563 --> 01:16:57,192
-不，不是…-不，不，听着你不听。
- No, it's not... - No, no, just listen. You're not listening.

762
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:02,404
昨晚……妈的，不是昨晚。
Last night... Fuck, not last night.

763
01:17:03,697 --> 01:17:05,200
这一切开始的那晚
The night all of this started,

764
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:08,578
艾米和我…
Amy and I...

765
01:17:11,038 --> 01:17:12,540
我们做了坏事。
We did something bad.

766
01:17:15,085 --> 01:17:16,834
我不明白你的意思。
I don't understand.

767
01:17:16,836 --> 01:17:20,757
艾米病了，好吗?就像，真的，真的病了。我们……
Amy was sick, okay? Like, really, truly sick. We...

768
01:17:21,715 --> 01:17:24,383
我们以为她体内有东西。
We thought that there was something inside her.

769
01:17:24,385 --> 01:17:27,972
也许一些…不好的事情，比如……
Maybe something... Something bad, like a...

770
01:17:28,848 --> 01:17:31,641
就像恶魔或灵魂。
Like a demon or spirit.

771
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:36,103
梅尔，你他妈在胡说些什么?
Mel, what the fuck are you babbling about?

772
01:17:36,105 --> 01:17:37,689
学校的一个男孩死了。
A boy at school died.

773
01:17:40,484 --> 01:17:41,819
这都是因为我们。
It was because of us.

774
01:17:44,029 --> 01:17:46,446
我们施了咒语，
We did a spell,

775
01:17:46,448 --> 01:17:49,241
让他停止散播谣言，
something to just make him stop spreading rumors,

776
01:17:49,243 --> 01:17:50,495
编造谎言。
making up lies.

777
01:17:52,831 --> 01:17:54,457
他本不该死的。
He was never supposed to die.

778
01:17:55,707 --> 01:17:58,584
但是出了问题。
But something went wrong.

779
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:02,088
那天晚上，他睡觉时舌头哽住了。
That night, he choked on his tongue while he was sleeping.

780
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,798
被自己的舌头噎死是不可能的。
It's impossible to choke on your own tongue.

781
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,303
嗯,它的发生而笑。
Well, it happened.

782
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:10,762
谁知道接下来会发生什么
And who knows what would have kept happening

783
01:18:10,764 --> 01:18:12,267
如果我们不阻止的话。
if we hadn't put a stop to it.

784
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:17,605
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

785
01:18:18,814 --> 01:18:22,109
-结束…-对艾米的迷恋结束了。
- Put an end to... - An end to the thing possessing Amy.

786
01:18:24,778 --> 01:18:25,779
一个恶魔?
A demon?

787
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,324
我们，我们不知道那是什么。
Well, we, we didn't know what it was.

788
01:18:30,326 --> 01:18:32,953
只说这很糟糕。
Just that it was bad.

789
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:37,333
-你做了什么?-我们想杀了它。
- What did you do? - We tried to kill it.

790
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,921
我们施了个咒语，是在网上找到的。
We did a spell, something we found online.

791
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:45,425
在线吗?
Online?

792
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:50,721
我认为……
I think...

793
01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:57,479
我觉得发生的一切
I think that everything that's been happening

794
01:18:58,645 --> 01:19:00,398
是因为我们施了咒语。
is because of a spell we did.

795
01:19:01,608 --> 01:19:03,777
我觉得我们搞砸了。
I think we messed up really bad.

796
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:16,623
如果你说的是真的，
If that's true, what you just said,

797
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:20,168
你之前怎么什么都没说?
why didn't you say anything before?

798
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:25,670
-我很害怕。-啊，勇敢到足以毁灭世界
- I was afraid. - Ah, brave enough to destroy the world

799
01:19:25,672 --> 01:19:28,173
但不敢承认，是吗?
but too chicken shit to own up to it, is that it?

800
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:29,176
什么?
What?

801
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:32,388
我要你看看那个浴缸。
I want you to look in that tub.

802
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:36,726
我要你看看你死去的弟弟。
I want you to look at your dead brother.

803
01:19:38,435 --> 01:19:40,061
你闻到了吗?
Do you smell that?

804
01:19:40,063 --> 01:19:41,272
这是他的尸体。
That's his corpse.

805
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:45,067
分解、腐烂。
Decomposing, rotting.

806
01:19:46,443 --> 01:19:51,115
都是因为你和你的巫毒女友!
And all because of you and your voodoo bitch girlfriend!

807
01:19:51,907 --> 01:19:56,076
我希望你在网上玩的时间值得你杀了你的家人。
I hope your fun little time on the Internet was worth murdering your family.

808
01:19:56,078 --> 01:19:59,871
对不起，对不起，对不起。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

809
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:03,459
你再这么跟我女儿说话我就割了你的喉咙。
Speak that way to my daughter again and I'll slit your fucking throat.

810
01:20:03,461 --> 01:20:05,713
我期待着这一天的到来。
I look forward to the day.

811
01:20:12,303 --> 01:20:15,473
我很抱歉。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

812
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:15,200
我们得吃掉他。
We need to eat him.

813
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:23,248
把他单独留下。
Leave him alone.

814
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:26,836
这是我们唯一的选择。
It's our only choice.

815
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,922
见鬼去吧。
Like hell it is.

816
01:21:30,965 --> 01:21:32,050
我们必须。
We have to.

817
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,251
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

818
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:09,754
我他妈的什么也看不见!
I can't fucking see anything!

819
01:22:12,256 --> 01:22:14,882
我想我是瞎了。耶稣基督。
I think I'm blind. Jesus Christ.

820
01:22:14,884 --> 01:22:17,134
你一直在不停地吸酒精湿巾。
You have been sucking alcohol wipes non-stop.

821
01:22:17,136 --> 01:22:20,137
-难怪你他妈的瞎了。-我们得找个东西割肉。
- No wonder you're fucking blind. - We need to find something to cut the flesh.

822
01:22:20,139 --> 01:22:22,056
你他妈的别碰他!
Don't you fucking touch him!

823
01:22:22,058 --> 01:22:25,060
停止代理歇斯底里!
Stop acting hysterical!

824
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:57,551
你们这些该死的巫师最好别再阻止我了。
Now none of you fucking witches better try and stop me.

825
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:01,305
我们要吃的。
We gotta eat.

826
01:23:04,768 --> 01:23:06,895
天啊，那是什么鬼东西!
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is that?!

827
01:23:10,814 --> 01:23:14,357
那是什么?那是什么鬼东西?
What is that? What in the hell is that?

828
01:23:39,844 --> 01:23:42,052
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

829
01:23:42,054 --> 01:23:44,723
我想我明白了。
I think I got it.

830
01:23:50,772 --> 01:23:51,773
是吗?
Yes?

831
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:54,901
当然可以。
Of course.

832
01:23:57,862 --> 01:23:59,486
是的。
Yes.

833
01:24:00,823 --> 01:24:01,825
不。
No.

834
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:12,834
我明白了。
I understand.

835
01:24:12,836 --> 01:24:13,837
是的。
Yes.

836
01:24:20,844 --> 01:24:22,427
你他妈在干什么?
What the fuck are you doing?

837
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:24,180
搞什么，罗伯特?
What the fuck, Robert?

838
01:24:28,684 --> 01:24:31,103
这很有道理，不是吗?
It makes sense, doesn't it?

839
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:34,523
是她先开始的。
She's the one who started it.

840
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:37,609
所以只有她能结束这一切。
So she's the only one who can end it.

841
01:24:38,862 --> 01:24:42,031
什么?这是艾米吗?
What? Was that Amy?

842
01:24:45,577 --> 01:24:47,118
结束这场噩梦，你个女巫。
End this nightmare, you witch.

843
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,203
女巫!
Witch!

844
01:24:49,205 --> 01:24:52,123
女巫,女巫!
Witch, witch!

845
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:55,375
杀了女巫，杀了女巫!
Kill the witch, kill the witch!

846
01:24:55,377 --> 01:24:57,003
杀死女巫!
Kill the witch!

847
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:58,170
离开!别管她!
Get away! Leave her alone!

848
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:01,257
杀死女巫。杀死女巫!
Kill the witch. Kill the witch!

849
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:04,927
-杀了女巫!-离她远点!别管她!
- Kill the witch! - Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

850
01:26:10,077 --> 01:26:11,953
杀死女巫!
Kill the witch!

851
01:26:11,955 --> 01:26:16,960
杀死女巫!
Kill the witch!

852
01:27:46,882 --> 01:27:49,135
我们一直都在这里吗?
Have we always been here?

853
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:54,431
什么?
What?

854
01:28:01,063 --> 01:28:06,068
门外什么都没有。
There's nothing outside the door.

855
01:28:06,653 --> 01:28:09,614
没有什么……
There's nothing...

856
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:13,410
什么都没有。
Nothing.

857
01:28:16,621 --> 01:28:17,622
什么都没有。
Nothing.

858
01:30:00,308 --> 01:30:01,309
好吧……
Okay...

859
01:30:04,269 --> 01:30:05,354
好吧,好吧…
Okay, okay...

860
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,607
我要出去看看，我要…
I'm gonna go out and see, I'm just gonna...

861
01:30:10,609 --> 01:30:13,362
我只是想看看。我马上就回来。
I'm just gonna see. I'll be back.

862
01:31:22,431 --> 01:31:23,433
妈妈?
Mom?

863
01:31:25,225 --> 01:31:26,227
妈妈?
Mom?

864
01:31:28,438 --> 01:31:29,439
妈妈?
Mom?

865
01:31:32,317 --> 01:31:33,318
妈妈?
Mom?

866
01:31:35,487 --> 01:31:36,569
妈妈?
Mom?

867
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:49,539
艾米!
Amy!

868
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:51,460
我曾经割伤过自己。
I used to cut myself.

869
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:16,234
——梅丽莎!——妈妈?
- Melissa! - Mom?

870
01:32:19,363 --> 01:32:22,698
妈妈……我看到艾米。
Mom... I saw Amy.

871
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,825
——我知道。我知道。-我看到艾米了
- I know. I know. - I saw Amy.

872
01:32:24,827 --> 01:32:26,285
我知道。我知道。
I know. I know.

873
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:27,869
我知道。
I know.

874
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:30,124
妈妈,外面是什么?
Mom, what's outside?

875
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:33,001
妈妈,外面是什么?
Mom, what's outside?

876
01:32:34,837 --> 01:32:38,213
不会有事的。不会有事的。
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

877
01:32:38,215 --> 01:32:39,714
不会有事的。
It's gonna be okay.

878
01:32:39,716 --> 01:32:41,342
不会有事的。不会有事的。
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

879
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,009
不会有事的。不会有事的。
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

880
01:32:43,011 --> 01:32:45,096
不会有事的。一切都会没事的。
It's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

881
01:32:45,098 --> 01:32:47,140
一切都会没事的。一切都会没事的。
Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

882
