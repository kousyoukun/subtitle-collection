事实上 我就是这么计划的

668
00:46:27,248 --> 00:46:30,551
- What?  - Don't worry Blu. It's in your DNA.
- 什么?  - 别担心 布鲁 你天生会飞的

669
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:34,013
And if our featherless friends can do it, how hard can it be?
而且 我们这位没毛的朋友都会飞 你怎么可能做不到呢?

670
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:38,100
Help me!
救我!

671
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,925
Fun right?
好玩吧?

672
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:41,843
Yeah, fun.
是啊 很有趣

673
00:46:42,274 --> 00:46:44,878
Okay, I need you two to get closer.
好了 现在你俩靠近点

674
00:46:45,696 --> 00:46:46,945
Closer.
再近点

675
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,551
Closer.
要更近

676
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:53,534
Nice.
很好

677
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:55,920
- Now, put your wings around each other.  - What?
- 现在 搭肩膀  - 什么?

678
00:46:55,924 --> 00:46:58,935
Come on, amigos, not that she's going to bite.
来嘛 朋友 她又不会吃了你

679
00:46:59,043 --> 00:47:01,293
- Will you?  - We'll see.
- 你会吗?  - 你试试就知道了

680
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,713
Now, you flap your right wing and you flap your left wing.
现在 你扇右翅膀 你扇左翅膀

681
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:06,923
And together, you fly.
然后一起用力 你们就飞起来了

682
00:47:07,614 --> 00:47:10,594
This doesn't seem aerodynamically possible.
这根本不符合空气动力学啊

683
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:13,305
You think too much.
你想太多了

684
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:15,350
Flying is not what you think up here.
飞翔不是靠想象

685
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:17,779
It's what you feel in here.
而是靠你去感受

686
00:47:17,787 --> 00:47:19,411
And when you feel the rhythm of your heart.
当你感受到自己的心跳时

687
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:21,272
It's like Samba.
就像是跳桑巴

688
00:47:21,483 --> 00:47:23,066
You fly.
你自然而然就飞起来了

689
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:29,574
See, it's easy.
看吧 就这么简单

690
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:30,715
Easy?
简单?

691
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,891
Easy for you to say because from here, it looks really really hard.
你会飞 当然觉得简单 我觉得难死了

692
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:39,187
Hey, if want to see Linda again, this is the only way.
嘿 如果你还想见到琳达 只能这么做

693
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,357
- Okay, you're right.  - Yes, I am.

694
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,566
- This is for Linda.  - Right.

695
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,443
- Keep it simple.  - Easy breezing.
- 放轻松  - 轻轻呼吸

696
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,903
- Trust, lift, drag...  - Come on, let's go!
- 坚定 抬起 起飞...  - 别嗦 我们飞!

697
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,468
- Wait!  - Outside, inside, outside, inside...
- 等等!  - 右 左 右 左...

698
00:47:49,488 --> 00:47:50,575
Come on Blu, you can do it!
加油 布鲁 你能做到的!

699
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,617
I can do it, I can do it...
我能做到 我能做到...

700
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,287
I can't do it!

701

703
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,445
This is incredible.
真难以置信

704
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:39,711
This is the most beautiful thing I ever seen.
我从没见过这么美的景色

705
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:43,213
- See what you've been missing?  - Yes.
- 知道你错过多少美景了吧?  - 是啊

706
00:48:49,684 --> 00:48:52,893
Alright, Blu, you're flying. Sort of.
好了 布鲁 你在飞呢 算飞吧

707
00:48:53,145 --> 00:48:55,269
Not really, but do you feel it?
虽然不是真的飞 但你感觉到了吗?

708
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,863
Yes, I do feel it.
是的 我感觉到了

709
00:49:11,978 --> 00:49:13,602
No, no, Blu!
不 不要 布鲁!

710
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,314
Mi Caramba!
该死的!(西班牙语)

711
00:49:25,304 --> 00:49:26,991
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
对不起 对不起 对不起!

712
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,619
We're going to die!
我们要死了!

713
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:01,217
- You did not feel it in here.  - You think?
- 你没有用心感受  - 你这么想?

714
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:05,178
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

715
00:50:08,101 --> 00:50:10,184
Hurry, you two barbos!

Is that too much to ask?

For a bird who can't fly, yes.
对于一只不会飞的鸟来说 是太多了

723

They're starting to close off the streets for Carnival.
他们开始为狂欢节而戒严了

724

Never be able to get my car through this crowd.

Don't worry, I'm on it.
别急 交给我

727
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:03,717
Hey, kid, where did you get this bike?

Hold on!

I'm going to chew through my own leg if this doesn't come off soon.
如果还是解不开 我就咬断自己的腿

放轻松 我们已经到了 现在去找路易兹

Nico, Pedro! What a family?
尼科 佩德罗! 大家都来了啊?

Where've you been hiding yourself, bird?

I want to be like you.

747
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:04,369
Don't, it's not what you think. We're just chained together.
别 和你们想得不一样 我们是被锁一起了

748
00:52:04,383 --> 00:52:07,295

- 嘿 不是我说你  - 在我们面前还装

It's time to take it to the next level.

What's wrong with this level?
