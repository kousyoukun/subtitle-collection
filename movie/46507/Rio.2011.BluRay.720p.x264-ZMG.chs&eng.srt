再见啦
Bye now.

49
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,230
是的  妈妈  我也想去看您
Yes, Mum. I'd love to visit.

50
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,920
但谁来照顾布鲁呢
But who'll take care of Blu?

51
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,680
没有特别照顾鹦鹉的保姆
Mum, they don't have candles for parrots.

52
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,120
这是你的热巧克力  布鲁
Here's your hot chocolate, Blu.

53
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,260
你最爱的口味
Just how you like it.

54
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,430
把布鲁留给别人照看我也不放心啊
Because I don't trust leaving Blu with just anyone.

55
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,330
没有  我没雇鹦鹉保姆
No, I don't have a bird sitter.

56
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,640
什么叫鹦鹉保姆啊
What is a bird sitter...

57
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,650
这才叫生活
This is the life.

58
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,820
棉花糖数量刚刚好
The perfect marshmallow to cocoa ratio.

59
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,300
一  二  三  四  五
One, two, three, four, five...

60
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,160
六个
Six!

61
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,430
看看  那可不是我最爱的大笨鸟
Well, if it isn't my favorite nerd bird.

62
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,350
好笑极了  你俩真是一点都不幼稚
Very funny, real mature.

63
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,600
宠物鸟  你今年要迁徙去什么地方啊
Hey Pet, where are you migrating to this year?

64
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,370
广阔的角落吗
The 'broad-first' nook?

65
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,550
随便你们怎么扔
Throw all the snow balls you want.

66
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,260
反正我有这神奇的防护罩保护  这学名叫玻璃
I'm protected by this magical force field, called "Glass".

67
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,820
我在这里面温暖又舒服
It's what keep us so toasty and warm in here,

68
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,720
你们就只能待在外面冻得你们...
while you guys are out there freezing your...

69
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,960
真无聊
Classy.

70
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,870
你还好吗
Are you all right?

71
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,980
我真有点不适应这天气
I'm not really built for this weather.

72
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,130
你是来找什么书的吗
Oh, are you looking for some books?

73
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,270
书
Books?

74
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,920
不  不是
No, no.

75
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,610
我长途跋涉六千英里来找他
I've come six thousand miles looking for him.

76
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,280
鸟类学博士
Doctor of Ornithology?

77
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,280
巴西里约热内卢保护中心

78
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,080
他太漂亮了
Ooh, he's magnificent.

79
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,060
琳达  我需要帮助  琳达
Linda, a little help here. Linda!

80
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,920
哇  你们俩还真能聊起来呢
Wow, you're actually communicating.

81
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,800
对  我摇摆尾巴上的羽毛  代表向他自我介绍
Yes, I introduced myself and shook my tail feathers,

82
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,550
逆时针转  表示他占据掌控地位
counter-clockwise, those referring to his dominance.

83
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,710
我可没明白还有这种意思
I did not get that at all.

84
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,520
那  蒙特罗博士
So, Dr Monteiro.

85
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,310
拜托别叫我博士  直接喊图里欧就行了
No Dr. Please, just call me Tulio.

86
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,230
金刚鹦鹉是种非常稀有的鸟
You know your Macaw is a very special bird.

87
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,480
事实上  据我们所知
In fact, as far as we know,

88
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,010
布鲁是他们种类的一根独苗
Blu is the last male of his kind.

89
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,070
-是吗  -是的
- Really? - Yes.

90
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,840
最近我们找到一只雌鸟
Recently we found a female.

91
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,090
我们希望让他们俩结合
And our hope is to bring the two of them together

92
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,660
一起拯救整个种群
to save their species.

93
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,710
当然  那她什么时候过来呢
Well, yeah, sure, when can she come over?

94
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,590
哦不不  她在巴西
Oh, no, she is in Brazil.

95
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,860
得让布鲁去里约热内卢
Blu must come to Rio De Janeiro.

96
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,460
里约  巴西
Rio, Brazil?

97
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,340
不行不行
Oh, no, no, no, no.

98
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,810
我从没和布鲁分开过
I never let Blu out of my sight.

99
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,940
他需要我
He needs me.

100
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,170
不是的  你误会了
Oh, no. You misunderstand.

101
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,890
已经安排好了  你会一路陪着他
It's all arranged. You'll be with him every step of the way.

102
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,020
我也会陪着你
And I'll be with you.

103
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,980
我知道这是你的工作
Look, I know you're doing your job.

104
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,610
但我不能  布鲁很特别
But, I can't... well, Blu's very particular...

105
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,300
我们有固定的生活习惯
And we have our little routine here

106
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,180
我们也不太喜欢旅行
and we're not big on travel.

107
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,990
而且  他都不会飞呢
Heck, he doesn't even fly.

108
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,570
他当然会飞
Of course he can fly.

109
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,850
他是最适合的研究样本
He's a perfect specimen.

110
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,040
你要干什么
What are you doing?

111
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,280
别担心  鸟的天性会帮助他飞起来的
Don't worry, their natural instincts always take over.

112
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,730
等等  别
Wait, no!

113
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,300
也许会
Well, almost always.

114
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,760
布鲁
Blu!

115
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,770
你是哪门子博士啊
What kind of doctor are you?

116
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,280
你还好吗
Are you okay?

117
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,450
也许他寄居惯了
Perhaps he's too domesticated.

118
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,410
非常感谢你来我店里
It was very nice of you to step in,

119
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,080
胡言乱语一通  还丢我的鸟
squawk around and throw my bird,

120
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,750
现在你该走了
but now it is time for you to go.

121
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,940
对不起
I'm very sorry.

122
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,840
真对不起  等等  琳达
I'm very sorry, but wait, Linda.

123
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,360
这是我们最后的机会
This could be our last chance.

124
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,220
一路顺风
Have a safe flight.

125
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,660
琳达  请听我说
Linda, please listen to me!

126
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,100
如果我们不这么做  他的种群就会灭绝
If we don't do this, his whole species will be gone.

127
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,750
好好考虑考虑
Just think about it.

128
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,910
天性
Natural instincts.

129
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
把我扔过半个房间
There is nothing natural

130
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,490
才不叫什么天性
about being thrown half way across the room.

131
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,080
我自己能飞
Hah, I'll show him.

132
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,580
我可以的  只要搞清原理
I can do this. I just have to work out the physics.

133
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,850
基本飞行原理  贝多芬著

134
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,750
保持翅膀与身体为矢量直角
I have quadrated my vector angles.

135
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,560
调整飞行气流  逐渐加强飞行力道
I have adjusted for wind shear, house every reinforcement.

136
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,480
相信自己

137
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,860
很好
Good.

138
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,880
好了  来吧
Okay, let's see.

139
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,680
机翼张开  很好
Flaps open, perfect.

140
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,510
起落架  已准备
Landing gear, checked.

141
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,970
尾翼  正常
Tail flaps, operational.

142
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,950
这样子  真不赖
And actually, not bad.

143
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,940
就是这次了  看我飞一个
This is it. Let's fly.

144
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,770
莫要复杂化
Just keep it simple.

145
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,940
推力  升力  阻力  等候
Thrust, lift, drag, and wait.

146

150
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,180
我保证过我会一直照顾你
I promised I'll always look out for you.

151
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,760
是吧
Didn't I?

152
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,330
我说话不算数过吗
Have I ever broken a promise?

153
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,790
我也很害怕
I'm scared too.

154
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,690
不正确的事
But I wouldn't make you do this

155
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,380
我是绝不会让你做的
if it wasn't the right thing to do.

156
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,820
你觉得呢  布鲁
What do you say Blu?

157
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,270
这才是我勇敢的宝贝
That's my big brave boy.

158
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,880
我们会很快回来的
We will be back home before we even know it.

159
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,680
你也来点  布鲁  别晒坏小嘴巴了
Your turn Blu. You don't want to get 'beak-burn'.

160
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,860
这是怎么回事
Wow, what's going on here?

161
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,700
-你正好赶上嘉年华了  -嘉年华

163
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,750
大家一起狂欢  跳舞
You know a time to have fun and dance.

164
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,750
我的妈啊
Oh mine!

165
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,250
她是参加表演的吗
Is she a performer?

166
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,090
不是  她其实是我的牙医
No, in fact she's my dentist.

167
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,860
巴波萨医生
Dr. Barbosa!

168
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,260
别忘了用牙线剔牙  图里欧
Do not forget to floss, Tulio.

169
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,350
当然
You got it.

170
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,620
明晚每个人都会穿成这样
Come tomorrow night, everyone will be dressed like that.

171
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,410
我肯定不会
Oh, not me.

172
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,120
等等
Oh, wait.

173
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,200
我不是本地鸟
I am not from here.

174
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,070
尼可  他是游客
Hey Nico, he's a tourist.

175
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,670
真有意思  可你长得不像
Funny, you don't look like one.

176
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,270
是吗  我不像吗
Really? I don't?

177
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,100
你鼻子上那个鸽子屎倒像本地的
Except, you've got pigeon dodo on your nose.

178
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,520
这是防晒指数3000的防晒霜
Oh, no, this is just SPF3000.

179
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,210
你是来参加嘉年华的吗
So, are you here for carnival?

180
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,280
其实  我是来见个姑娘的

181
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,860
-哎哟  见姑娘  -对
- Huh, a girl? - Yes.

182
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,660
小小建议  你得主动点
Little word of advice. You make the first move.

183
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,740
-巴西女孩最爱自信满满的男生  -好的
- Brazilian ladies respond to confidence. - Oh, right.

184
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,790
是的  一定要大摇大摆的
Yes, it's all about swagger.

185
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,820
你要把胸挺得高高的
You've got to pop out that chest,

186
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,530
把尾巴摆起来
swing that tail,

187
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,320
眯着眼睛  像某些疯狂发情的鹰
eyes narrowed look like some kind of crazy love hawk.

188
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,090
-但首先我们得把你弄出来  -什么
- But first we've got to bust you out. - What?

189
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,050
我开你这笼子就像开汽水瓶一样易如反掌
I'm gonna pop that cage open like a soda cap.

190
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,740
不用不用
No, no...

191
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,470
谢谢  不用了
No, that's okay.

192
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,120
你这叫易如反掌啊
You call that popping?

193
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,820
这东西还挺结实的嘛
This thing's robust.

194
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,940
老兄  我没事  笼子挺好的
No, guys really, I'm fine. The cage is great.

195
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
我爱笼子
Love the cage.

196
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,840
达博  该走了
Dabbo, suit yourself.

197
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,070
别忘了  学发情的鹰  啊哦
Don't forget, love hawk.

198
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,180
好的  我们一起学
Yes... and to you as well.

199
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,880
这是我们鸟舍最重要的地方
This is the heart and soul of our aviary.

200
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,420
治疗室
Our treatment room.

201
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,890
他们真喜欢你
They really like you.

202
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,270
-这么多鸟  -当然
- A lot. - Yes!

203
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,220
我是他们的大鸟妈妈
I'm their great big mama bird.

204
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,250
-来点吗  -谢谢  不用了
- You want some? - No, I'm good.

205
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,320
这里很多鸟都是从走私犯那救出来的
Many of the birds here were rescued from smugglers.

206
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,470
-走私犯  -是的
- Smugglers? - Yes.

207
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,870
不幸的是  营救这些小可怜时
Unfortunately, the poor birds are often hurt.

208
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,430
经常会弄伤他们  有些甚至夭折
or even killed in the process.

209
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,290
但只要护理得当  他们就能恢复
But with proper care, they can be saved.

210
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,620
看看
Look here.

211
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,630
这可怜的小东西昨天被救回来的
This poor guy was found last night.

212
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,690
伙计  你今天看上去好多了
Hey buddy, you're looking great today.

213
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,010
比昨天好多了
Much better, much better.

214
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,340
早日康复哦
Get well soon.

215
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,790
珠儿在哪呢
So, where is Jewel?

216
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,040
我们把珠儿安置在一个特别的地方
Oh, we have a special place for Jewel.

217
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,170
她是只非常有性格的鸟
She's a very spirited bird.

218
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,920
可不是
I'll say.

219
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,460
这是她弄的吗
She did that?

220
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,560
真迷人
Charming.

221
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,530
好了  我现在想回家了
Okay, I want to go home now.

222

不用担心
No, don't worry.

223
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,970
我会把你打扮得帅不可挡
I'm going to make you look irresistible.

224
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,560
救命  救命  放我出去
Help! Help! Let me out of here!

225
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,730
琳达

226
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,670
-也许我该  -别  先试试
- Maybe I should... - No, give it a chance.

227
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,230
有鸟吗
Hello?

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,960
鸟啊你在哪
Hello?

229
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,880
我是和平的使者
I come in peace.

230
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,890
她太美了
She's beautiful.

231
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,790
他们真是胡说八道  她  她就是个天使
What were they talking about? She's... like an angel.

232
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,530
这个天使越来越  靠近我了
An angel whose getting really close up!

233
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,910
-你踩到我喉咙了  -你是个美国的
- You're standing on my throat. - You're an American.

234
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,520
多谢高抬贵脚
Thanks.

235
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,710
我用喉咙说话  所以  谢谢你了
I need my throat for talking, so thank you.

236
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,190

237
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,150
你好
Hi.

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,040
你好  我叫布鲁
Hi. My name is Blu.

239
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,550
蓝纹奶酪的蓝色的谐音
You know like the cheese with the mould on it.

240
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,090
虽然蓝纹奶酪很臭吧
No, it smells really bad.

241
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,180
我这是说了些什么  太丢人了
That's stupid, stupid, stupid.

242
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,620
好了  来吧  我们的时间不多
Alright come on, we don't have much time.

243
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,810
等等  
Wait, wait! Ouch!

244
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,610
-你准备好了吗  -准备好什么
- Are you ready? - For what?

245
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
哦哦  那个啊  呃  那就来吧
Oh, oh, wow. Aah... okay.

246
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,750
自信
Confidence!

247
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,740
疯狂发情的鹰
Crazy love hawk.

248
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,920
喂  你干什么呢
Wow, hey! What are you doing?

249
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,700
什么  你想让我干什么
What? What you want me to.

250
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,540
弱弱地问一句  那你想要干什么
But just for argument sake, what are you doing?

251
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,940
我想逃走
I am trying to escape.

252
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,040
这样啊  对  逃走
Oh..., ya... escape,

253
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,330
我刚也是想着逃走  才那样的
that's where I was going with that thing I just did.

254
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,530
等等
Wait, wait.

255
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,820
你以为我想让你亲我吗
Did you actually think we were going to kiss?

256
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,570
-当然不是  -我们才见面
- No, no, no! - We just met!

257
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,970
-我的老天  -我觉得他们需要点帮助
- Oh mine! - I think they need a little help.

258
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,420
我知道我羽毛很漂亮  
I know how my feathers look,

259
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,000
但我绝不是那种不负责任的鸟
but I'm not that kind of bird.

260
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,320
说你  说我
Say you, say me.

261
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,820
这可不是我策划的
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

262
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,320
但  这歌还挺好听的
But, it's actually a pretty good song.

263
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,950
"自然地"  对  莱昂纳尔唱的
"Naturally..." yes, sing it Lionel.

264
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,420
进展飞速啊
Wow, That was fast.

265
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,880
莱昂纳尔・里奇的歌  百发百中
Lionel Richie. Works every time.

266
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,090
我们回避下吧
We should probably give them some privacy.

267
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,350
我不放心把布鲁单独留在那
I'm not so sure I should leave Blu here alone.

268
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,880
不用担心
Oh no, don't worry.

269
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,430
赛尔微欧整晚在这值班的
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.

270
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,770
而且  他有珠儿作伴
Besides, he's got Jewel.

271
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,090
救命啊
Help me!

272
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,350
这是嘉年华开始前最后一次倒数  
This is the final countdown to Carnival!

273
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,980
让我们一起跳起桑巴
Let's Samba.

274
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,740
过来吧  小鸟鸟
Come here little birdie.

275
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,990
没事的  我保护你
It's okay. I got you.

276
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,890
不好意思
Excuse me!

277
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,880
不好意思  我想睡觉
Please, I'm trying to sleep.

278
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,170
不好意思哦  嗑睡虫  可我想逃走
I'm sorry sleepy head, I'm trying to escape.

279
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,260
逃走  为什么  这个笼子超级棒
Escape, why? This cage is awesome.

280
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,680
这个笼子  我在想什么呢
This cage...? Oh, what was I thinking?

281
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,140
我还指望一只宠物鸟能理解
I wouldn't expect a pet to understand.

282
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,690
宠物鸟  你叫我宠物鸟
Pet? Did you just call me a pet?

283
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,810
严正声明  我不是宠物鸟
For the record, I am not a pet.

284
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,190
我是同伴
I am a companion.

285
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,860
而且  你爱干啥干啥
And you know what? Do whatever you want.

286
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,840
明天一早  琳达就来接我了
Cause' tomorrow morning, Linda will come for me,

287
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,670
这个噩梦就可以结束了
and this whole nightmare will be over.

288
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,220
太神奇了  你宁愿和人类在一起
Incredibly, you rather be with a human

289
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,680
也不愿和同类在一起
than with your own kind.

290
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,180
那个人类
Well, that human

291
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,790
爱护我照顾我整整十五年
has given me love and affection for the past 15 years,

292
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,930
我的同类  见了我才十五秒  就想掐死我
whereas my own kind tries to strangle me after 15 seconds.

293
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,850
就是因为他们  我失去了一切
Yah, it's because of them, I've lost everything.

294
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,410
你不能信任他们
You can't trust them!

295
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,150
你当然能信任人类
Of course, you can trust humans.

296
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,630
珠儿
Jewel?

297
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,950
珠儿
Jewel?

298
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,140
你好啊
Hi there!

299
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,590
很高兴你陪我吃饭
It's nice of you to join me for dinner.

300
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,130
我一般都一个人吃
I often eat alone.

301
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,920
当然是因为  我的工作原因
Because of course, my work.

302
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,280
遇到你之前  我以为我才是鸟控
I thought I was the 'bird-mad' until I met you.

303
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,410
当然了  你有最喜欢的鸟吗
Yes, right. Do you have a favorite bird?

304
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,770
显然  蓝金刚鹦鹉是我的菜
Well, obviously I'm a Blue Macaw kind of gal.

305
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,250
有道理  这种鸟非常漂亮
That makes sense. They are very handsome birds.

306
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,730
其实  我更被他们的智慧所吸引
Actually, it's the brains I'm attracted to.

307
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,360
我对鲜艳羽毛的亮丽外表不太感冒
I'm not so impressed by fancy feathers.

308
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,470
我完全明白你的意思
I know exactly, what you mean.

309
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,450
我的最爱是斑点猫头鹰
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

310
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,140
他们水汪汪  炯炯有神的大眼
I've always been mesmerized by those big,

311
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,950
把我萌翻了
round intelligent eyes.

312
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,520
要鸡卷吗
Chicken rolls?

313
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,880
伦巴达[巴西现代快步舞]
Lambada.

314
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,320
眼镜脏了
Chicken eyes.

315
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,980
我的天啊
Oh gosh!

316
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,850
喂
Hello.

317
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,750
布鲁
Oh, Blu.

318
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,650
我们不该离开的
We should have never left.

319
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,480
-都是我的错  -别这样  琳达
- This is is all my fault. - No Linda, please.

320
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,460
这不是你的错
This is not your fault.

321
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,550
你说得对  这不是我的错
You're right, It's not my fault.

322
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,360
-这是你的错  -什么
- It's your fault! - What?

323
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,350
就因为你一通长篇鸟论
With your little bird talk,

324
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,810
还有一堆
and that whole...

325
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,470
听着
Well, you know what?

326
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,660
叽叽喳喳  喳喳叽叽[真正意义上的鸟语]
Squawk squawking is squawk-squawk!

327
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,340
不好意思  我不想诅咒你的
I am sorry. I didn't mean to curse.

328
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,180
我不懂
I don't understand!

329
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,360
赛尔微欧是业内最厉害的保安
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.

330
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,700
这么说吧
So let me get this straight.

331
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,820
你被一只小白鸟袭击了
You were attacked by a little white bird.

332
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,290
是的  用这个抹布  他像这样捂住我嘴巴
Yes, with this rag he held it to my mouth, like this.

333
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,520
这下完了
We're doomed.

334
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,430
哪里都比不上家里好  哪里都比不上家里好
Okay, there's no place like home, there's no place like home.

335
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,560
我真想回到我的笼子里
How I wish I was back in my cage

336
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,600
有我的小镜子  秋千  还有小铃铛
with my mirror and my swing and my little bell.

337
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,210
-我想我的小铃铛  -嘘  装死
- How I miss my little bell. - Ssshh, play dead.

338
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,450
什么  我用不着装
What? I don't need to play dead.

339
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,920
我已经快心脏病发作了
I'm about to have a heart attack.

340
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,650
-赶紧的  -好吧
- Just do it! - Fine.

341
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,390
-别抽抽了  -拜托  做戏要做足
- Stop twitching. - Come on, it's the twitching that sells it.

342
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
进来吧  孩子
Come on in, kid.

343
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,260
咱们来看看  干的不错  费尔南多
Well, what do you know? Good work, Fernando.

344
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,960
你们看  我跟你们说啥来着
You see boys. What did I tell you about this one?

345
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,710
是当时你说只给他一半的报酬吗
That you are going to pay him half as much as what you said?

346
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,230
不是  你个蠢蛋
No, you idiot.

347
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,260
是他让我想起了我当年的样子
That he reminds me of myself when I was that age.

348
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,300
足智多谋  给你  孩子
Smart, resourceful. Here you go, kid.

349
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,100
喂  这才只有当时说好的一半啊
Hey, this is only half of what you promised me.

350
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,470
少废话  小屁孩儿
Shut up, kid.

351
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,410
我勒个...
What the...?

352
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,210
我记得我跟你说过  要活的
I thought I told you I needed these birds alive.

353
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,590
你说  费尔南多  你看这像是活的吗
Tell me, Fernando. Does this look alive to you?

354
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,110
像吗
Huh?

355
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,220
-抓住它  -在那儿
- Get it! - Over here!

356
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,720
珠儿
Jewel!

357
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,920
你好啊  美人儿
Hello, pretty bird.

358
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,800
你怎么了
What's the matter?

359
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,260
我抓住你的喉咙了吗
Cockatoo got your throat?

360
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,230
奈吉尔  要活的
Nigel, alive.

361
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,700
这事儿没完
To be continued.

362
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,710
这就是你的计划吗  自己逃出去把我留这儿
That was your plan! To take off and leave me!

363
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,960
真是谢谢你了啊
Gee, thanks.

364
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,020
你怎么不跟着我
Why didn't you follow me?

365
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,360
-干得好  奈吉尔  -干得好  奈吉尔
- Nice work, Nigel. - Yah, nice work, Nigel.

366
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,090
最后两只蓝色金刚鹦鹉
The last two Macawsan birds.

367
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,850
它们价值连城
These are worth a fortune.

368
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,750
费尔南多  把笼子挂到屋里
Hey, Fernando! Hang these up in the other room.

369
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,780
-你们好啊小鸟  -让我出去  让我出去
- Hey, birdie.  - Let me out! Let me out!

370
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,970
让我出去啊
Let me out of here!

371
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,450
我很漂亮  我很漂亮
Pretty bird. I'm a pretty bird.

372
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,330
我很漂亮  我很漂亮  哈哈
Pretty bird. I'm a pretty bird, hahaha!

373
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,130
他们搞错了啊  我根本就不是鸟
I was framed. They got the wrong guy.

374
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,830
对不住了  我不是有意的
Sorry guys. Nothing personal.

375
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,180
它们会怎么样呢
So, what is going to happen to them?

376
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,730
别担心  我们会给它们找到一个温暖的家
Don't worry. We're going to find good homes for them.

377
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,750
现在回家找妈妈去吧
Now go home to Mama.

378
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,110
-但是我没有妈妈  -爸爸呢
- But I don't have a Mama. -Father?

379
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,110
-兄弟呢  -金鱼呢
- Brother? - Gold fish?

380
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,610
我们收养他吧  老大
Can we keep him, boss?

381
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,070
不行
No!

382
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,160
马修  它们到底会怎样呢
So Marcel, what's really going to happen to those birds?

383
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,740
吃了也好  弄死当标本也罢  关我屁事
Dulled, plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares.

384
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,180
我只知道  咱们这下可赚大发了
All I know is, we are going to be rich.

385
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,690
我们要有钱了
We're gonna to be rich.

386
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,320
快来  球赛开始了
Come on, the game's starting.

387
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,740
对  你听清楚  明天交易或者免谈
Yes, you be very clear. Tomorrow or the deal is off.

388
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,490
当然了  我有两只蓝色金刚鹦鹉
Of course, I have both the Macaws.

389
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,750
是的  我会亲自送货的
Yes, I'll deliver them myself.

390
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,410
再见
Au revoir.

391
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,360
你俩听好了  我们今晚装车
Alright you two, we load the truck tonight.

392
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,360
明天一早  就把这些鸟运到机场
First thing in the morning, we bring those birds to the airport.

393
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,240
-听明白了吗  -知道了
- You got it? - Yeah, sure, heard you.

394
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,200
你们选一个人  去喂奈吉尔
And one of you, feed Nigel.

395
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,980
石头  剪子  布  靠 
Rock paper scissors, shoot.

396
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,690
哈
Yes!

397
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,460
不对  剪刀剪石头[骗傻子不要钱啊]
No-no, scissors cut rock.

398
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,760
唉  你怎么每次都能赢[因为你是弱智]
Oh man, how come you always win?

399
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,320
好鸟鸟
Nice birdie.

400
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,580
吃饭饭嘛
Here you go.

401
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,340
食肉鸟
Ughh, cannibal.

402
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,840
好的  不要惊慌  关键在于不要惊慌
Okay, hold it together. The key is not to panic.

403
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,900
我没惊慌啊
I'm not panicking.

404
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,030
我没跟你说话  我自言自语呢
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to me.

405
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,930
没关系  琳达随时会找到我们的
But it's okay. Because any minute now, Linda will find us.

406
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,150
是啊  然后她会
Oh great, and then she'll

407
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,410
把咱们换到另一个笼子里  对吧
just stick us behind another set of bars, right?

408
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,800
是啊  不  不是那样
Yes, I mean no!

409
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,350
听着  宠物笼子也许适合你
Look, pet cages might work

410
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,040
但是我不想成为任何人的玩物
for you but I don't want to belong to anyone.

411
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,560
我嘴上好像卡了个东西
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

412
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,660
你介意吗
Would you mind?

413
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,060
我知道我现在算不上帅
Oh, I know I'm not a pretty birdie.

414
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,940
但我曾经却风光无限
But I used to be quite a looker.

415
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,470
明星是也
The star.

416
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,480
灯光  摄影  开始
Lights, camera, action.

417
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,790
我曾有的完美的身材
I was striking svelte.

418
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,050
从头到脚  光彩夺目
Ambitious feet-to-beak.

419
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,350
鸟中独领风骚
So birdie-licious.

420
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,240
现在我是卑鄙的  可怕的坏蛋
Now I'm vile. I'm villain and vicious.

421
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,980
并且还很恶毒
Oh, and malicious.

422
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,660
我曾拥有一切  电视和女人
I had it all, TV shows, women too.

423
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,410
我很高挑  36厘米高
I was tall. Over 1'foot 2".

424
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,000
然后他们找了一只漂亮鹦鹉顶替我
Then they got a pretty parrot to fill my shoes.

425
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,270
这就是我堕落至此的原因  
That's why I am so evil, why I do what I do.

426
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,080
他曾是超级明星  年轻而有活力
He was a superstar. So young and vital.

427
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,550
他声名远扬  是南美洲的偶像
He's nasty. A Southern American idol.

428
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,130
他现在是恶毒的鸟  谁这么说我
He's a vicious bird. Who said that about me?

429
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,840
一只十分恶毒的鸟  我把你们烤了
A very vicious bird. I'll have you rotisseried.

430
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,920
我是有羽毛的尖喙怪物  鸟类终结者
I am a feathery freak with beak, a bird murderer.

431
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,640
你觉得你比我更强  但是我从未听说
You think you're better than me. I've never heard of you.

432
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,250
我很恶毒  我喂你们吃象鼻虫的芝士球
I'm evil. I'll feed your cheese balls with weevils.

433
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,440
我在人们身上拉屎  然后嫁祸给海鸥
I poop on people and I blame it on seagulls.

434
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,780
是它干的
It was him.

435
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,210
他是险恶之鸟  我所向无敌
He's a nasty bird, I'm invincible.

436
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,540
它是可怕的
He's ghastly.

437
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,550
我所向无敌  无人敢洗  
I'm invincible, I'm unwashable, unrinsible.

438
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,000
就像是废弃的学校  我没有准则
Like an abandoned school, I have no principles.

439
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,310
你们巴西的鸟儿
All of you Brazilian birds

440
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,830
所有一千八百万只鸟儿
All 18 million birds.

441
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,350
我来告诉你们我要干什么
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

442
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,040
我要让你们
I'm going to make you...

443
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,110
闭嘴  都给我闭嘴
Shut up now, shut up!

444
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,400
我独唱
Just me.

445
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:11,320
我会让你们也变得丑陋
I will make you ugly too.

446
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,100
-喂  -祝你们做个噩梦
- Hey! - Sweet nightmares.

447
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,920
什么啊  这么吓人  一点都不帅
Not cool man. Scary, but not cool!

448
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,370
-你还好吗  -不好
- Hey, are you okay? - No.

449
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,670
我好个头啊
I'm definitely not okay!

450
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,090
-你干什么呢  -逃出这里
- What are you doing? - Getting out of here.

451
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,920
你到底帮不帮我吧
You going to help me, or what?

452
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,460
其实  救生手册上说
Actually our survival guide

453
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,800
我们应该保持镇定  坐等救援才会得救
said to sit and wait, and help will come.

454
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,300
没人会来的
No one is coming!

455
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:38,330
我们只能靠自己  如果在这等下去  咱俩都得死
We are on our own and if we just sit here, we're going to die!

456
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,650
好  好  好
Yes, yes, yes.

457
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,110
不
No!

458
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,400
奈吉尔  一边去
Nigel, get out of the way!

459
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,990
停停停  为啥不直接打开门呢
Stop, stop. Why don't you just open the door?

460
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,100
你开什么玩笑  
Are you kidding me?

461
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,200
怎么了  很简单的一个插销而已嘛
Why? It's just a standard flip slide ball.

462
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,620
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

463
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,870
-我不会  -什么  你不会什么
- Well I can't... - What? You can't what?

464
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,420
我不会飞
I can't fly!

465
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:13,010
-你早点说会死啊  -之前也不需要飞啊
- You couldn't tell me before now! - It didn't matter before now.

466
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,060
我鄙视你
I hate you.

467
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,900
-还有什么我需要知道的吗  -有
- There is something else I need to know? - Yes!

468
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,260
我不能飞  我抠嘴[类似于人类抠鼻孔]
I can't fly, I pick my beak

469
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,140
我有时候在鸟池里撒尿
and once in a while I pee in the bird bath.

470
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,840
高兴了
Happy?

471
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,650
那里  他们在那
There, they are!

472
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,820
我们得离开这儿
We got to get out of here!

473
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,110
等等  听我说
Wait. Listen to me.

474
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,690
我虽然不会飞  但是我特别会走  听我的
Flying may not be my thing, but walking is. Follow my lead.

475
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,870
-左右左  左右左[两人三足]  -明白
- Inside right, outside left. - Okay, I've got it.

476
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,410
左右左  左右左
Inside, outside, inside, outside.

477
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,880
好啊  好啊  加油
Yes, yes! Come on!

478
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,430
看  我还是双语人才
See, I'm bilingual too.

479
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,080
好极了
This is great!

480
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,390
我和世界上唯一不会飞的鸟绑在一起
I'm chained to the only bird in the world who can't fly!

481
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,840
其实  世界上有四十种鸟类不会飞
Actually, there are 40 species of flightless birds.

482
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,150
-弯腰[英文同鸭子]  -不  鸭子会飞
- Duck! - No, Ducks can fly!

483
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,990
我说让你弯腰
No! Duck!

484
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,820
好耶
Oh yes!

485
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,290
好耶
Yes!

486
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,330
冷静点
Calm down!

487
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,650
不  不
Nooo! Nooorrr!

488
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,390
滚开  你们这些肮脏的家禽
Get out of here, you putrid poultry.

489
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,310
-啊  那是啥  -一根木棍
- Oh, what was that? - A stick.

490
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,270
-啊  那个呢  -只是一块石头
- Ahh, and that? - It's just a rock.

491
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,620
-我感觉后背有只蜘蛛  -你有完没完
- Is that a spider on my back? - Will you quit it?

492
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,410
树叶而已  转过去我看看
It's just a leaf. Turn around.

493
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,910
树叶而已
Leaf.

494
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,140
跟你说了
Told you.

495
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,450
来吧  我们得找个安全的地方过夜
Come on, we need to find a safe place to spend the night.

496
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,040
安全  我们在丛林里怎么安全
Safe? Safe! We're in the jungle!

497
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,070
人们说那地方是个丛林的时候
You know when people say it's a jungle out there,

498
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,190
我很确定  他们肯定不觉得那是个好地方
I'm pretty sure they don't mean it as a good thing.

499
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,640
听着  我虽然不想这么说
Look, I hate to break it to you,

500
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,130
但这是我们鸟类天然的栖息地
but this is where our kind naturally lives.

501
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,680
别跟我讲自然的知识  我平时经常看动物世界
Hey, don't talk to me about nature. I watch Animal Planet.

502
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,770
我了解所有的食物链
I know all about the food chain.

503
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,470
你看  我在这儿就是别人的开胃菜
You see, out here I'm just a hors d'oeuvre.

504
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,760
就是一个羽毛春卷而已
Nothing more than a feathery spring roll.

505
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,920
这就是为什么我们要待在树上而不是地面
That is why we stay on the trees and not on the ground.

506
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,400
您先请
After you.

507
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,180
哦  不  我不这么觉得
Oh no, I don't think so.

508
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,180
我觉得我待在人造的地方会好点
I'll feel much more comfortable in something man-made.

509
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,960
那边怎样
How about up there?

510
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,270
我简直不能相信  我得拽着你这笨鸟上去
I can't believe I've to drag your clumsy butt up there.

511
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,280
拽着我  你瞧好吧
Drag me? Watch and learn.

512
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,160
布鲁  等等
Blu! Just wait!

513
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,310
看看谁拽着谁
Who's dragging who's butt now, huh?

514
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,500
好吧  好吧  你赢了
Ha, ha very funny.

515
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,740
你看  谁还需要飞
You see, who needs flying?

516
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,450
鸟  鸟需要飞翔
Birds, birds need flying.

517
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,700
飞翔就意味着  自由
Flying is... freedom

518
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,560
不用依赖任何人
and not having to rely on anyone.

519
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,270
你不希望这样吗
Don't you want that?

520
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,870
我不知道  听起来有点孤独
I don't know. Sounds a little lonely.

521
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,480
睡觉吧
Let's get some sleep.

522
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,050
我还是稍微晚点睡吧
I'm probably going to be up for a little while.

523
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,540
我还在倒时差呢
Because I'm still on Minnesota's time.

524
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,180
晚安
Good night.

525
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,680
晚安  珠儿
Good night Jewel.

526
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,560
晚安  琳达
Good night Linda.

527
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,320
您好  先生  您见过我的鸟了吗
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen my bird?

528
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,300
见过我的鸟吗
Have you seen my bird?

529
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,580
您好  您看见我的鸟了吗
Excuse me, have you seen my bird?

530
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,370
您看见我的鸟了吗
Have you seen my bird?

531
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,220
女士  美国女士
Lady, American lady.

532
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,140
布鲁  布鲁
Blu? Blu?

533
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,820
我知道您的鸟在哪  
I know where your birds are.

534
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,610
是布鲁吗  你确定吗
You found Blu? Are you sure?

535
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,650
是它
It's his.

536
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,830
让我看看
Let me see that.

537
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,120
没错  就是它
You're right.

538
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,890
好的  它在哪
Okay, where is he?

539
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,190
来吧  咱们走  我带你去找它
Come on, let's go. I'll take you to him.

540
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,590
等等  琳达  我们又不认识他
No, no Linda, wait. We don't know this boy.

541
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,070
我们不能相信他
We can't trust him.

542
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,630
我必须相信他
I have to trust him.

543
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,030
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

544
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,900
你们以为我是脑残吗
Do you think I'm an idiot?

545
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,450
两只鸟  拴在一起  关在笼子里
There were two birds, chained together, in a cage.

546
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,930
你们怎么能看丢了
How could you lose them?

547
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,880
它们比我们聪明  但是别担心
They out smart us boss. But don't worry.

548
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,520
我们会抓到它们的  我有个计划
We'll get them back. I have a plan.

549
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,580
真的啊  你有何高见
Oh great. What are you going to do?

550
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,570
在城里转悠  然后喊着  "鸟儿鸟儿快来这儿"
Wonder in the city, calling "Here birdie-birdie, here birdie!"

551
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,570
你这么说的话  什么计划听起来都够呆的
Well, anything sounds dumb when you say it like that.

552
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,780
我们今晚必须把它们送到机场
We have to get birds to the airport by tonight.

553
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,790
但今天狂欢节  所有的道路都会被封锁的
But it's Carnival. All the roads will be blocked by the parade.

554
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,980
这就是我为什么想要今早送到
That's why I wanted to go this morning!

555
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,140
奈吉尔
Nigel!

556
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,400
这只鸟比你们俩加起来聪明十倍
This bird is ten times smarter than the two of you combined.

557
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,190
它这么聪明  怎么不让它管啊
If he's so smart why don't you put him in charge?

558
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,300
我就是要让它管
I am putting him in charge.

559
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,530
你不说话会死啊
Stop suggesting things!

560
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,370
找到它们  奈吉尔
Go find them, Nigel.

561
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,420
如果我们没法穿过游行人群
Hmm, if we can't get through the parade,

562
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,380
我们要加入到游行中去
we'll have to be in the parade.

563
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,520
-你确定这个能成功  -肯定
- Are you sure it is going to work? - Positive.

564
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,140
我都用公式算好了
Check my map.

565
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,850
那还真是让人放心不少啊  谢谢你
Yes, that's just comforting. Thank you.

566
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,440
听着  只要把这个锁链弄断
Look, let's just get this chain broken.

567
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,930
然后我们就能去找琳达
Right, then we can go find Linda.

568
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,150
不  你去找琳达
No, you can go find Linda.

569
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,280
一旦我们自由了
Once this chain is off,

570
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,360
我要飞回到丛林中去
I'm going back to being free in the jungle.

571
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,120
-成交?  -好  成交
- Deal? - Fine, deal.

572
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,540
干得不错啊  天才
Nice try brainiac.

573
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,950
我觉得有什么东西在盯着咱们
I think something is watching us.

574
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,080
哎哟  小心点布鲁  
Oh, be careful Blu.

575
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,830
这些小玩意儿可能会弄死你呢
They might snuggle you to death.

576
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,000
过来吧
Oh, come here.

577
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,350
攻击
Attack!

578
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,210
这里怎么了
What is going on down there?

579
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,170
走  都走开
Go, go, go. Off with you.

580
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,030
宝贝们  我跟你们说了很多遍了
Okay guys, guys. I told you a thousand times.

581
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,390
马内拉  索菲亚  卡玛娜  听我说  正中我眼
Manuela Sofia Kamana, listen to me. Ow! O'yah, right in the eye.

582
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,330
它们多可爱啊  对吧
Oh precious, ain't they?

583
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,220
一共十七个孩子  还有一个没孵出来呢
The kids! Seventeen of them and one on the way.

584
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,480
嘿  帕克 卡洛斯  别玩你们的弟弟
Hey, Paco Carlos stop shaking him.

585
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,750
它们成了我身上漂亮的羽毛
They have given me great feathers.

586
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,250
爸爸需要歇会儿了
Oh, this papa needs a break.

587
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,990
你们小两口要去狂欢节吗
So, you two love birds headed for Carnival?

588
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,800
-不是情侣  -我们只是认识而已
- Wow, love birds? - We're more like acquaintance birds.

589
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,590
其实那都算不上  我们只是拴在一起
And not even that. We're more like 'chained-together' birds.

590
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,160
是的  我是说  哦
Yes, I mean... Ouch!

591
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,100
你的孩子们是怎么了  这么喜欢羽毛
What is it with these kids and the feathers?

592
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,380
我们也不知道  应该去医院查查
We have no idea, we're having them tested.

593
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,460
你能帮我们把这个弄断吗
So, do you think you could help us get this thing off?

594
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,720
你们真幸运  认识我拉斐尔  
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,

595
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,190
你就认识了所有人
and Rafael knows everyone.

596
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,730
又是打眼睛
Ow! Again with the eye!

597
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,140
听着  再闹我就叫你们妈了
Okay, you want me to call your mother!

598
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,180
不要
No!

599
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,750
屡试不爽  它们都很怕她
Works every time. They are scared to death of her.

600
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,350
叫我干什么
Call me for what?

601
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,230
伊娃  我的心肝儿
Eva, my love.

602
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,600
我得带这对情侣去见鲁伊兹
I must take this young couple to see Luiz.

603
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,680
鲁伊兹
Luiz?

604
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,360
你还想骗我
You don't fool me for a second.

605
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,470
你们就是想去偷偷参加狂欢节
You and your amigos just want to sneak off to Carnival.

606
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,730
说到狂欢节
Oh Carnival.

607
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,320
就是在那次神奇的狂欢节
That magical time

608
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,060
我见到了世界上最美丽的鸟儿
when I met the most beautiful bird in the world.

609
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,140
我还记得咱们相遇时
I still remember the song

610
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,140
回荡着的歌声
that was playing when I first laid eyes on you.

611
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,020
高佻而健康  年轻而可爱
'Tall and tanning, young and lovely,'

612
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,880
伊伯尼玛的姑娘缓缓踱步
'the girl from Ipanema goes walking.'

613
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,160
来吧  宝贝  一起唱
Come on baby, sing it.

614
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,510
当她缓缓走过时
'And when she passes'

615
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,150
每个路人都惊呼不已
'Each one she passes goes 'Aah!!!''

616
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,520
就像是天籁之音
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

617
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,020
爱情不光是盲目的  也是让人耳聋的
I guess love is deaf too.

618
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,040
来吧  宝贝
Come here, mmm.

619
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:37,010
好吧  带它们去见鲁伊兹  但要早点回来
Okay, take them to Luiz, but hurry back.

620
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,680
你真是一个天使
You are an angel.

621
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,850
我会想念你的  我的小芒果
I'll miss you, my juicy little mango.

622
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,500
我也是  我的小木瓜
Oh me too. My pouchy papaya.

623
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,900
帕克  卡洛斯  把你们弟弟放下
Hey! Paco, Carlos! Put your brother down, now!

624
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,890
她竟然放我走了
I can't believe she actually let me go.

625
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,050
鲁伊兹离这儿多远呢
So how far is this Luiz?

626
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,000
不远  乌鸦飞半个小时就到了
Not far, 30 minutes says the crow flies.

627
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,570
那鹦鹉走路去  要多久呢
And how long does the Macaw walks?

628
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,530
俺家亲爱的不会飞呢
Bobo here can't fly.

629
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,410
-它是只鸟啊  -不是所有的鸟都会飞的
- But he's a bird. - Not all birds fly.

630
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,530
-比如鸵鸟  -你又不是鸵鸟
- There are Ostriches... - You're not an Ostrich.

631
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,020
-理论上来说可不一定  -等等
- Well, not technically. - Wait, wait, wait...

632
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,570
朋友们  我想帮你们  但要走着去
My friends, I want to help you, but to walk the whole way,

633
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,360
-根本到不了嘛  -爸爸在哪呢
- It...it can't be done! - Where's daddy...?

634
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,880
爸爸  爸爸
Daddy, daddy!

635
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,020
但是  我们也许能试试别的方法
But hey, we might as well give it a shot.

636
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,090
快走
Let's go, quickly.

637
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,340
别回头  它们能感知恐惧
No, don't back. They sense fear.

638
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,030
敬告  不要喂食野生动物

639
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,350
真是只可爱的猴子
What an adorable monkey.

640
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,120
嘿  我的手表呢
Hey, my watch!

641
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,510
你们好
Hello boys.

642
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,010
看来你们今天收获颇丰啊
Seems like you had a busy day.

643
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,330
什么  这个吗
Oh, what? This?

644
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,270
这些是我们捡的
This is just some stuff we found.

645
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,020
对不对  小子们
Right boys?

646
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,030
我对你们的小玩意不感兴趣
I'm not interested in your nicked knickknacks.

647
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,930
我不喜欢小偷小摸
Your burgle-bobbles bore me.

648
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,430
有这么两只蓝金刚鹦鹉
There are two blue Macaws out there.

649
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,540
我要你的小喽罗们找到它们
And I need your multitude of vice to help me find them.

650
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,520
那我们有什么好处呢
Oh yes, what's in it for us?

651
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,840
问得好
That's a fair question.

652
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,140
咱们来谈谈吧
Let's discuss it.

653
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,990
我很明白你的意思
I certainly see your point.

654
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,740
但是我该怎么做才能报答你呢
But what could I possibly do for you in return?

655
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,590
救救我  救救我
Save me, save me!

656
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,920
这是个办法
Oh, that's a thought.

657
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,380
这样就行了吗
This is enough?

658
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,600
我可不想强迫你做什么
I don't want to feel like I'm cheating you.

659
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,440
我们去找  我们去找  救救我吧
We'll do it, we'll do it. Save me, please.

660
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:25,220
救救我
Save me!

661
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,020
好的  我同意了  成交
Alright, you twisted my wing. Deal.

662
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,140
那么  还有疑问吗
Now then, any more questions?

663
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,420
没有吗  很好
No? Good!

664
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,460
你们分散去找它们  今晚之前必须找到
You'll spread out and find these Macaws by the end of the day.

665
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,070
不然给你们每人都上堂飞行课
Or it's flying lessons for everyone!

666
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,320
去吧
Go!

667
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,080
去耍你们的猴把戏吧
Go do your monkey business.

668
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,860
我改主意了
I changed my mind.

669
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,130
要不我们搭巴士去吧
Maybe we can find a bus schedule or something.

670
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,340
不会吧  你现在哪能退缩
Come on, you are not going to back out now?

671
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,520
还当着小姑娘的面
Not in front of a lady.

672
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,390
好吧  那好吧  好吧好吧
Okay, yes..., sure.

673
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,210
太好了  就是这种精神
All right, that's the spirit.

674
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,810
你确定你决定要飞了
You sure you're up for this?

675
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,710
反正又不是
I mean it's not like just

676
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,180
直接从山上跳下去呗
we're hurdling ourselves off the mountain or something.

677
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,800
是吧
Right?

678
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,200
其实  我就是这么打算的
Actually that was pretty much my entire plan.

679
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,870
什么
What?

680
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,560
别担心  布鲁  你有飞行基因
Don't worry Blu. It's in your DNA.

681
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,410
那些没羽毛的哥们都能飞
And if our featherless friends can do it,

682
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,020
能有多难
how hard can it be?

683
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,110
救我
Help me!

684
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,920
你看  有意思吧
Fun right?

685
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,850
对  真有意思
Yeah, fun.

686
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,880
你们两个靠近点
Okay, I need you two to get closer.

687
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,950
再近点
Closer.

688
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,560
再近点
Closer.

689
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,540
很好
Nice.

690
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,260
现在  你们相互挽住翅膀
Now, put your wings around each other.

691
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,920
什么
What?

692
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,940
行了吧  兄弟  她又不会咬你
Come on amigos, Not that she's going to bite.

693
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,300
-你会咬他吗  -等着瞧
- Will you? - We'll see.

694
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,720
现在  你扇右翼  你扇左翼
Now, you flap your right wing and you flap your left wing.

695
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,930
一起扇  你们就可以飞了
And together, you fly.

696
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,600
这看起来不符合空气动力学原理
This doesn't seem aerodynamically possible.

697
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,310
你想太多了
You think too much.

698
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,350
你光用脑子想  是飞不起来的
Flying is not what you think up here.

699
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,780
要用心去感受
It's what you feel in here.

700
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,410
当你感受到心中的节奏
And when you feel the rhythm of your heart.

701
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,270
就像跳桑巴
It's like samba.

702
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,070
你就能飞了
You fly.

703
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,570
看看  很简单吧
See, it's easy.

704
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,710
简单吗
Easy?

705
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,960
对你来说简单  
Easy for you to say.

706
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,890
但对我来说  那是非常非常难
Because from here, it look really really hard.

707
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,980
如果你还想见琳达  
Hey, if want to see Linda again,

708
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,190
只有这办法
this is the only way.

709
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,980
-好吧  你说的对  -当然
- Okay, you're right. - Yes, I am.

710
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,280
-为了琳达  -对
- This is for Linda. - Right.

711
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,490
-易如反掌  -易如风掠
- Keep it simple. - Easy breezing.

712
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,070
信自己  抬起脚  慢步向前...   
Trust, lift, drag...

713
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,490
-来吧  飞喽  -等等  
- Oh, come on, let's go! - Wait!

714
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,480
左  右  左  右...
Outside, inside, outside, inside...

715
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,570
加油  布鲁  你能行
Come on Blu, you can do it!

716
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,620
我能行  我能行...
I can do it, I can do it...

717
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,290
我不行!
I can't do it!

718
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,250
不是吧  怎么又这样
Not again!

719
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,010
-我死了吗  -没  我们还活着
- Am I dead? - No, we are still alive!

720
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,440
太不可思议了
This is incredible.

721
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,710
这是我所见过的最美的场景
This is the most beautiful thing I ever seen.

722
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,210
-知道你以前错过了什么吧  -是啊
- See what you've been missing? - Yes.

723
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,890
布鲁  不管怎么说  你也飞了  
Alright Blu, you're flying. Sort of.

724
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,260
虽然不用动翅膀  但你感觉到了吗
Not really, but do you feel it?

725
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,850
是  我感觉到了
Yes, I do feel it.

726
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,600
不  不  布鲁
No, no, Blu!

727
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,310
我的天啊
Mi Caramba!

728
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,980
对不起对不起对不起  
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

729
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,610
我们要死了
We're going to die!

730
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,920
你还是没用心感受  
You did not feel it in here.

731
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,210
你以为
You think?

732
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,170
我们搭车去找鲁伊兹
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

733
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,170
你们两个快点  过来
Hurry you two, barbos! Barbos!

734
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,450
这儿都是什么人啊
What's to the species here?

735
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,160
快走
Move it!

736
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,430
快点上来  爱情鸟
Come on love birds.

737
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,830
你成功了
You made it.

738
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,600
就让我安全待五分钟不出生入死
I would love to go five minutes without getting killed.

739
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,980
就这么难吗
Is that too much to ask?

740
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,110
对于一只不会飞的鸟来说  那是当然
For a bird who can't fly, oh yeah.

741
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,820
他们开始为嘉年华封锁街道了
They're starting to close off the streets for Carnival.

742
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,540
小子  最好你说得没错  
Better be right, kid,

743
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,720
因为我们快没时间了
because we're running out of time.

744
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,720
这么多人  车肯定开不过去了
Never be able to get my car through this crowd.

745
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,340
别担心  交给我了
Don't worry, I'm on it.

746
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,700
小子  你这摩托车哪儿来的
Hey kid, where did you get this bike?

747
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,190
用你的吉普车换的
I traded it for your jeep.

748
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:06,850
什么
What?

749
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,500
是啊  这车车况非常好
Yes, it's in great condition.

750
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,920
其实也就还好吧
Well, good condition.

751
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,780
让开  让开
Hey, out of the way!

752
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,220
小心
Look out!

753
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,320
抓紧了
Hold on!

754
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,500
要不是马上就能解开这锁
I'm going to chew my own leg

755
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,710
我现在就把我的腿啃断
if this doesn't come off soon.

756
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,200
放松点  我们找到鲁伊兹了
Relax, we find Luiz,

757
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,590
我们到目的地了
we're right where we want to be.

758
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,680
拉斐  
Hey, Ralfi!

759
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,760
这不是我们的狂欢节之王嘛
If it isn't the king of carnival.

760
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,980
尼可  佩德罗  瞧这一家子
Nico, Pedro! What a family?

761
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,900
鸟兄  你躲哪儿去了  
Where've you been hiding yourself, bird?

762
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,230
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

763
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,000
等等  话说回来
Hold up, rewind.

764
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,530
这不是那只笼中之鸟吗
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

765
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,990
我们的爱情课真是立竿见影
I think our love lesson would down smooth.

766
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,400
你进展真快
You work fast.

767
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,670
小宝贝也有鹰钩鼻
Baby got beak.

768
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,700
原来的笼中之鸟  
You was locked up

769
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,060
现在有辣妞相伴
and now you're rolling with a hot wing.

770
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,750
我真想和你一样
I want to be like you.

771
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,960
别这样  不是你们想得那样  
Don't, it's not what you think.

772
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,350
我们只是被拴在一起
We're just chained together.

773
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,910
我没指手画脚
Hey, I'm not judging you.

774
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,270
给俺留点幻想空间
Keep us spastic.

775
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,130
伙计们  我们在找鲁伊兹  
Hey guys, we're looking for Luiz.

776
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:10,750
你们见过他吗
Have you seen him?

777
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,480
我见过他  但你没见过
Yes, I see him but you didn't.

778
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,820
他刚走  
You just missed him.

779
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,480
他回车库了
He took the trolley back to the garage.

780
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,670
好极了
Oh great.

781
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,180
没事的小宝贝  你可以赶下一趟
Relax baby bird, you can catch the next one.

782
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,640
是时候  进行下一阶段了
It's time to take it to the next level.

783
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,990
这阶段怎么了
What's wrong with this level?

784
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,650
得了吧  这阶段啥都不是
Come on, this ain't the level.

785
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,770
接下来才精彩
Next level is the level.

786
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,920
-你得摇动尾部羽毛  -是啊
- You got to shake your tail feather. - Oh yes.

787
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,310
我们得把这链条取下
We got to get this chain off.

788
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,080
来吧  爱情鸟  你们可是在里约
Come on love birds, you are in Rio.

789
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,540
你们该好好享受  享受生活
You should enjoy it. Live a little.

790
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,650
我们找到他们了
We got them.

791
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,720
欢迎来到天堂
Welcome to paradise.

792
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,070
是派对吗
Some party, huh?

793
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,230
这儿是我见过的最酷的地方
This is the coolest place I've ever seen.

794
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,520
虽然可能有点卫生问题
Despite all the RVS health code violations.

795
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,050
我喜欢你  我都听不懂你说什么
I like you. Nothing you say makes any sense.

796
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,260
大家听好了
Alright everyone listen up.

797
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,040
拉斐从镇外带来些特邀嘉宾
Ralfi has some special guests from out of town.

798
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,500
让我们展现我们的热情
Let's show them some love

799
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,220
因为我想他们不常出来玩
because I don't think they get out very much.

800
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,070
大家把翅膀合起来
Everybody put their wings together

801
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:32,440
尽情鼓掌吧
and clap them as loud as you can.

802
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,750
鼓掌  鼓掌  尽情鼓掌
Clap them, clap them. I don't care, slap them.

803
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,400
派对开始喽  我的宝贝
Party in an opening, my baby.

804
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,850
我想要派对
I wanna party

805
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,550
我想跳桑巴
I wanna samba

806
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,410
我想要派对
I wanna party

807
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,270
我想跳桑巴
I wanna samba

808
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:53,200
我想要派对  活出精彩
I wanna party and live my life

809
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:57,830
我想要派对  想要飞翔
I wanna party and fly

810
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,470
-我可以飞翔  就像鸟一样  -你本来就是鸟
- I'mma fly, fly just like the birds  - But you're a bird.

811
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,800
就那样让我飞吧  
Oh yah thats right so let me fly,

812
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,090
像火箭一样
like a rocket then

813
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,550
飞得太高  
Fly so high ,

814
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,720
我得下来吸口氧
where I need to come down for oxygen

815
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,980
因为一旦开始了  
Cause once we start it baby,

816
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,720
我们就不会停下
ain't no ain't no stopping then

817
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:16,200
因为我只想活出精彩 想要派对  
Cause I just wanna live my life and party

818
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,670
我所想要的就是自由自在  
All I want to do is to be free,

819
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,810
摇动我的身体
and rock my body

820
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,890
环游世界  
And around the world,

821
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,250
活出精彩
and I wanna live my life

822
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,540
就在里约  里约  里约生活
In Rio, Rio, Rio, Rio life

823
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,090
你在干什么
What are you doing?

824
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,370
我也不知道
I do not know.

825
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,290
不错啊  布鲁
Alright, Blu.

826
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,470
我是桑巴  桑巴大师  
I'm that samba samba master,

827

828
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,620
谁来听我的大音炮[手提式大录音机]
Who shall sound from my ghetto blaster,

829
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,910
大音炮  大音炮  大音炮

830
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,870
她喜欢你  
Hey, she likes you.

831
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:44,900
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

832
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,210
你在听吗  
Have you been listening?

833
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,510
不  我在看
No, I've been watching.

834
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,930
随心而动  去吧
Just be yourself, go on.

835
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,190
我想要派对

839
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,470
你们两个跟我走
You two are coming with me.

840
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,660
做你的猴头梦吧
In your little monkey dreams.

841
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,210
那是吐给你的
That was meant for you.

842
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,600
我们就不能和平共处吗
Come on, can we all get along?

843
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,180
大鼻子  这可不关你的事
This isn't your fight big nose.

844
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:07,130
你找我朋友麻烦  就是找我麻烦
You mess with my friend, you mess with me!

845
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,450
还有我们
And us!

846
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,680
对  你这小金刚
Yes, little King Kong.

847
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,900
我是来打酱油的
I don't know what's going on here.

848
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,930
鸟猴大战开始 
Birds vs. Monkeys!

849
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,920
干掉他们
Get them!

850
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,800
去死吧  小山民  
Yippee-kay-yay mountain man!

851
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,260
没打到
Miss!

852
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,910
我们得走了
We have to go!

853
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,980
要搭顺风鸟吗
Need a lift?

854
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,200
接招  臭猴子
Take that you, funky monkey.

855
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,560
-谢谢你  -不客气
- Thank you! - Any time!

856
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,000
那正如我所说
That's what I'm talking about.

857
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,740
鸟人  我们胜利了
Bird man, we threw down!

858
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,960
是啊  我们胜利了
Yes, we threw down.

859
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,880
你们这俩家伙就像火和冰
You guys were like fire and ice.

860
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,640
雷鸣和闪电
Thunder and lightning.

861
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:28,640
嘻和哈
Hip and hop.

862
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,090
芝士和糖末
Cheese and sprinkles.

863
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:32,930
那是明尼苏达的俗语
It's a Minnesota thing.

864
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,350
你看  都不知道你在说什么
You see, nothing you say makes any sense.

865
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,790
过来  跟我走
Come on, follow me.

866
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,960
怎么搞的
What?

867
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,080
小鸟们应该在这里
But, the birds were here.

868
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,420
对  它们肯定在这  小子
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

869
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,790
我发誓  那些鸟应该在这里
I swear. The birds were right here.

870
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,030
你怎么会知道呢
How do you know?

871
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,380
因为我也是抓鸟人之一
Because I'm the one who took them.

872
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,010
-是你   -我不想伤害任何人
- You? - I didn't want to hurt anybody.

873
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,010
我只想弄点钱
I just needed the money.

874
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,300
费尔南多  我信任你  
Fernando, I trusted you.

875
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,380
我知道但...
I know but...

876
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,680
老兄  那是很棒
Oh man, that's good.

877
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,030
你们好
Hey guys.

878
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,780
你在这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

879
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,330
我只是来看看  
I just wanted to see

880
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,080
有什么可以帮忙的吗
if you have any work for me.

881
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,140
如果你早两小时来
Well, if you were here two hours ago,

882
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,960
就可以帮我们装...
you could have helped us load...

883
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,150
什么  
What?

884
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,440
闭嘴
Shut up!

885
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,830
你们穿得这么漂亮是去嘉年华吗
So, why are you guys dressed for Carnival?

886
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,600
不  我们偷运这些鸟时  
No, no one will know us

887
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,960
就不会被发现了...
when we smuggle these birds...Ouch!

888
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,280
闭嘴
Shut up!

889
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,740
我们要弄辆彩车
We need a float.

890
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,310
彩车
A float!

891
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,660
你们要去参加游行啊  我能去吗
So you guys are going to the parade. Can I come?

892
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,100
我跳舞很棒 
I'm a great dancer.

893
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,310
他能去吗
Can he come?

894
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,980
就让他去吧  三个总比两个强
Come on, please. Three's better than two.

895
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,840
好吧  我们得抓紧时间了
Fine. We got to hurry though.

896
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:54,500
我差点忘了
Wow, I almost forgot.

897
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,240
我放哪里了呢  我想应该就在这里
Where did I put it? I thought it was right here.

898
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,620
在这
There it is!

899
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,040
我拿到了
Got it!

900
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,600
我们走
Let's go.

901
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,430
快点  小子
Hurry up, kid.

902
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,710
他能和我们一起上飞机吗
Can he go on the plane with us too?

903
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,630
闭嘴
Shut up.

904
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,050
我们不能让他们上飞机
We can't let them get on the plane.

905
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,800
你会骑摩托的  对吗
You can ride a motorcycle, right?

906
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:20,470
你少侮辱我
You insult me.

907
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,590
不  我不会骑摩托
No, I can't drive a motorcycle.

908
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,520
这就像骑机动雪橇一样
It's just like riding a snowmobile.

909
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,580
出啥事了
What happened?

910
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,860
爸爸
Papa?

911
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,250
发生什么了
What happened?

912
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,360
别伤害我
Don't hurt me.

913
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,280
别唧唧歪歪  告诉我
Stop your chirping and talk to me!

914
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,010
不  我什么都不知道
No, I don't know anything.

915
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,760
我咬下你的脑袋的时候
When I go biting down your head,

916
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,720
它是会爆开  还是会裂开呢
will it go pop or will it go crack?

917
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,240
那些小鸟去哪儿了
Where are the civilian birds?

918
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,230
我是说布鲁去哪儿了
That means Blu by the way.

919
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,570
他们跑了  去找鲁伊兹了
They escaped, went to Luiz.

920
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,020
还有什么
Anything else?

921
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,130
他们说你特善良
They said you were very nice.

922
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,550
真的吗
Did they?

923
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,610
骗子
Liar.

924
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,410
还很帅呢
And handsome too?

925
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:47,310
永远别让猴子去做什么鸟事
Never send a monkey to do a bird's job.

926
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,560
别担心  我懂的
Don't worry, I got it.

927
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,110
他行动了  那才是我的好小子
There he goes. That's my boy.

928
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:26,020
热吗  我好像流汗了
Is it hot? I think I'm sweating.

929
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,000
尽管生理学上根本不可能
I don't think it was even biologically possible.

930
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,060
看啊
Look

931
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,050
是啊  那就是你的好小子  很好   
Yes, that's your boy, alright.

932
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:33,980
他需要点火花
Okay, so he needs a little help.

933
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,430
来吧  我们就给他点火花
Oh, come on, let's give him some.

934
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,960
营造点气氛
Set the mood.

935
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,280
我来吧  这我懂
I'm on it. I know how to set the Mood.

936
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,290

Check it out.

937
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,270
上啊  上啊  去泡妞
Get it, get it, get it, get it girl

938
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,410
上啊  上啊  去泡妞
Get-get, get-get, get-get it girl.

939
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,630
带她  带她去跳舞
Take her, take her to the floor

940
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,580
给她看看  给她看看你多会扭
Show her, show her how you roll

941
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,790
低点  低点  再低点
Drop it, drop it, drop it low

942
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,960
低点  低点  再低点
Drop it low, drop drop it, drop it low

943
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,330
这算啥气氛啊
Wow, wow, wow! What kind of mood is that?

944
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,210
佩德罗  佩德罗  你有点过火了
Pedro, Pedro. A little too aggressively.

945
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:56,880
尽管你的创意不错  
I'm not hating on your creativity,

946
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,210
但  还是看看我的吧
but I think I've got this one.

947
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,530
跟上我的调调
Follow my lead.

948
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,940
这才对头
Now that's more like it.

949
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,000
不去想  不去看
Wasn't really thinking, wasn't looking

950
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,650
不去寻找答案
Wasn't searching for an answer

951
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,370
在月光下
In the moonlight

952
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:31,870
当我看到你的脸庞
When I saw you face

953
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,940
多美的日落啊 
Wow, what a beautiful sunset.

954
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,420
是啊
Yes.

955
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,050
布鲁  听我说
Psst! Blu, down here.

956
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,180
告诉她  你的眼睛很美
Tell her, you have beautiful eyes.

957
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,740
好  好主意
That's good, great idea.

958
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,830
我的眼睛很美
I have beautiful eyes.

959
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,090
呃  是  是  是不错

960
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,070
不  是"她的眼睛"  "她的眼睛"
No! "Her eyes," Her eyes "!

961
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,590
你的眼睛
Your eyes.

962
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,350
你的眼睛很棒  我的不咋地
Your eyes are great, not mine.

963
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,260
我是说我的也还凑合  但你的眼睛...
I mean mine are okay but yours...

964
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,530
你眼睛可以望眼欲穿
I bet you can see right through them.

965
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,820
布鲁
Blu!

966
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,580
只需告诉她你的感受
Just tell her how you feel.

967
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:11,930
-珠儿  -怎么了
- Jewel. - Yes?

968
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:15,330
我一直想告诉你  我...
I've been wanting to tell you, that I...

969
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,280
我...
that I... hoook!

970
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,210
多可爱  都凝噎了
How sweet, you're getting choked up.

971
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,320
你真噎了!
You're choking!

972
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,780
好吧  我来帮你
Okay! Alright!

973
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:36,270
好吧  这就是我家小子
Yap, that's my boy.

974
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,790
女士们先生们  鲁伊兹的汽车修理厂到了
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Luiz's garage.

975
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,830
你先请
After you.

976
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,800
-不 不  你先请  -请进  我坚持
- No, no, you first. - Please, I insist, ok.

977
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,470
我想这下能搞定了
I guess this is it.

978
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,990
是啊  刚才惊心动魄啊
Yes, quite an adventure.

979
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,860
至少结局不错 
End of the line

980
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,600
是啊
Ah, yes.

981
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,260
我想这种事在小苏达不会发生吧
I guess things like these don't happen in Tiny-sota.

982
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,510
什么小苏打
Tiny-sota?

983
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,310
等等  你说的是迷你苏打吧[取明尼苏达谐音]
Oh wait, Minnesota?

984
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:18,870
是啊
Yes.

985
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,140
很好  很搞笑
That's very good. That's very funny actually.

986
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,270
鲁伊兹
Luiz!

987
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,900
你在吗  鲁伊兹
Are you here, Luiz?

988
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,180
老兄
Hey Buddy.

989
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,450
我带了几个朋友想和你见一见
I got some friends I want you to meet.

990
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,580
左右  左右...
Inside-outside-inside-outside..!

991
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,590
我逮到你了哟
I got you... good.

992
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,000
什么
What?

993
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,070
我能扯烂你的喉咙
I could have rip your throats out.

994
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:50,340
但我不会
But I didn't.

995
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,560
但我本来可以的
But I could have.

996
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,890
你好鲁伊兹
Hey Luiz!

997
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,750
别吓着我的朋友们
Stop scaring my friends.

998
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,620
你好  拉斐  过来  
Hey Ralfi, come here!

999
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,670
你去哪儿了
Where have you been?

1000
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,750
你气色不错
You look good.

1001
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,940
等等  鲁伊兹是只斗牛犬吗
Wait, wait. Luiz is a bulldog?

1002
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,030
你对狗有啥意见吗
You got something against dogs?

1003
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,450
流我一身口水的时候我就有意见了
I do when they're drooling on me.

1004
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,370
人家这是一种医学症状嘛
It's a medical condition.

1005
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,910
朋友  我们真的需要你
No, amigo. We really need you.

1006
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,420
她真讨厌  
She's mean, brother.

1007
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:18,480
鲁伊兹  帮帮忙吧  
Luiz, come on, please.

1008
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,850
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

1009
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,210
我有办法
I think I know what to do.

1010
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,260
你肯定这样安全吗  
Are you sure this is safe?

1011
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,450
当然  没问题
Sure, there's nothing to it.

1012
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,920
如果出啥问题  就使劲大声喊
Now if something goes wrong, scream really loud.

1013
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:43,190
因为我戴着这玩意儿  听不清
Because I can't hear too good with this thing on.

1014
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,540
拉斐  打开开关
Hey Ralfi! Get the switch, please!

1015
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:49,010
别担心  他是个专家
Don't worry. He's a professional.

1016
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,290
别乱动
Try not to move.

1017
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,580
而且我戴这玩意可见度也不大好
I can't really see out of this thing either.

1018
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,960
你们去哪了
Hey, where'd you go?

1019
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,440
恶心死了
Gross.

1020
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,710
但我自由了
But I'm free.

1021
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,920
珠儿  我们自由了
Jewel, we are free!

1022
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,380
黏糊糊的  但是自由啦
Slimey, but free!

1023
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,800
可能被细菌感染  但是自由了
Contaminated probably, but free.

1024
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:53,380
你能相信吗  咱们终于
Can you believe it, finally.

1025
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,140
结束了
Over.

1026
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,430
太棒啦
Oh yes!

1027
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,810
伙计们  我们走
Come on guys, let's go!

1028
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:06,520
我们还傻站在这干嘛  这可是狂欢节啊
What are we standing around for. It's Carnival!

1029
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,890
我完全理解你现在的感受
I know just how you feel.

1030
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,360
看着他们在高处飞  恨不得立即追上它们
Watching them up there, makes you want to chase them,

1031
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:30,300
一把塞进嘴里  把脖子咬断
grab them in your mouth and bite their heads off.

1032
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,760
开个玩笑罢了  伙计
I'm just kidding, bro.

1033
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,220
追上它们得使出吃奶的劲
Chasing them is plenty.

1034
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:52,070
我在翱翔  像鸟一样尽情的翱翔
I'm flying, just like a bird.

1035
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,010
珠儿  你就是一只鸟好不好
Jewel, but you are a bird.

1036
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:01,010
你去哪
Hey, where are you going?

1037
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,270
布鲁
Blu?

1038
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,100
布鲁  怎么了
Blu, What wrong?

1039
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,900
没事  一切都很完美
Nothing. Everything is perfect.

1040
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:13,590
你会回到森林里  我会回到琳达身边
You'll be off to the rainforest. I'll be back to Linda.

1041
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,280
-和我们计划的一样  -我
- Just like we planned. - I...

1042
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,370
我说你们  别叽歪了  赶紧展翅高飞
Hey birds! Stop yapping and start flapping.

1043
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,780
我们快走吧
Let's go!

1044
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:23,580
-我想也许  -什么  你要来明尼苏达吗
- I guess I thought maybe... - What, that you'll come to Minnesota?

1045
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,790
不错  我可以给你织个围脖
Great, I guess I make you a scarf.

1046
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:28,460
不  我不是那意思
No, that's not what I meant.

1047
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,690
珠儿  我不可能一辈子
Look Jewel, I can't spend my life walking around

1048
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,460
都跟在你屁股后面用走的
following you wherever you're going.

1049
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,840
你不能飞  又不是我的错
Hey, it's not my fault you can't fly.

1050
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:39,340
这下尴尬了
Awkward.

1051
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,660
得啦  得啦
Okay, okay.

1052
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,810
把这层窗户纸捅破就好啦
You know what? This is good, just clear the air.

1053
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:45,940
彼此以诚相待
Just be completely honest with each other.

1054
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,680
你想听实话吗  很好  我可以说实话
You want honesty! Fine, I can be honest.

1055
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:49,910
我不属于这里
I don't belong here.

1056
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,850
事实上  一开始我根本就不想来
In fact, I never wanted to come here in the first place.

1057
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,130
还有  还有  你知道怎么着
And...and, you know what?

1058
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,490
我讨厌桑巴舞
I hate to Samba!

1059
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,200
喂  这话有点过了
Hey, that's a little too far.

1060
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,390
让这坏鸟收回他说的话
Make the mean bird take it back.

1061
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:09,290
怎么着吧  我就这么说了  每首歌都是同一个调子
Yes, I said it. Every song sounds exactly the same.

1062
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,920
蹦嚓嚓  蹦嚓嚓 无聊
Tiko-tako, yayaya, Tiko-tako, yayaya. Urghhh.

1063
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,480
我受够这里的蹦嚓嚓了
I'm tiko-tako out of here.

1064
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:18,190
好吧  后会有期  可怜的宠物
Fine! See you around, pet.

1065
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:19,620
别介  别介  快回来
No, no, no, come back!

1066
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:24,010
你们俩天造地设啊  简直就是当今朱丽叶与罗密欧
You belong together! You're Juliet, to his Romeo.

1067
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:27,930
当然  他们最后都蹬腿了  但你们懂我的
Sure, they both die in the end but you get my point!

1068
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:32,040
年轻人谈恋爱老这么戏剧化
Young love, always so melodramatic.

1069
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,340
伙计们  跟上她
Alright boys, go after her.

1070
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:36,450
布鲁
Blu!

1071
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,570
回来啊  别闹了
Come back here, come on!

1072
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,490
狂欢节  我来啦
I'm ready for Carnival!

1073
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:45,180
谁想骑在我的  水果上
Who wants to ride on my...fruit?

1074
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,750
他们居然把我给甩了
They left without me.

1075
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,460
居然没有等人家
I'm missed out.

1076
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,710
珠儿  珠儿  等等
Jewel! Jewel! Wait up!

1077
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,860
你这是要去哪啊  小美妞
Going somewhere, pretty bird?

1078
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,560
那是
Oh yes!

1079
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,430
我正要去抠出你的眼睛
I was on my way to crawl your eyes out!

1080
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,790
珠儿
Jewel!

1081
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,190
冷静  冷静
Temper, temper.

1082
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,730
现在跟着我  亲爱的  我们一起去参加游行
Now come along my dear, we are going to the parade.

1083
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,340
大家都爱游行
Everybody loves the parade.

1084
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,470
放开我
Let go of me!

1085
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,810
快回来
Hey, get back here!

1086
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:29,940
没人敢欺负我们佩德罗的朋友
Nobody messes with a friend of Pedro.

1087
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:33,310
这事绝不可能让它发生  来点士气
Ain't happening! It's on! Come on!

1088
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,980
你没看那家伙的铁爪吗
Did you see the talon on that guy?

1089
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,980
铁爪
Talon?

1090
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,480
绝不轻饶  那还是下次吧
Maybe it's on, next time.

1091
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,090
拉斐  救命啊  救命啊
Ralfi, help, help!

1092
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,970
拉斐尔  别跟着我
Rafael, quit following me.

1093
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,230
你走错方向了  狂欢节不是在那边吗
You're going in the wrong direction. Isn't Carnival that way?

1094
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,270
我不去狂欢节
I'm not going to Carnival.

1095
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,400
-不去啊  我是要回家  -但我还以为你喜欢狂欢节
- No, I'm going home. - But I thought you loved Carnival.

1096
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,460
我是喜欢  但我更爱我的家人
I do, but I love my family much more.

1097
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:05,070
这是我用心  而不是大脑做出的选择
And that's a choice I made with this, and not with this.

1098
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,100
布鲁  布鲁  我正飞着
Blu! Blu! Hey Blu! I was flying,

1099
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,860
看见了那个大个头葵花鹦鹉  
then I saw this big cockatoo

1100
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,960
那大铁爪不是闹着玩的
with big ninja talon.

1101
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,020
这个葵花鹦鹉丑陋无比  赶紧有话直说
This cockatoo was ugly. Anyway to the point.

1102
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,210
珠儿就在那  他把珠儿抓走了
Then Jewel was there, and he snatched Jewel up.

1103
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,590
他牛气的说  "小公主  跟我走"
Then he was like, "You coming with me you little princess?"

1104
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:19,840
然后珠儿左勾拳
And Jewel was like, Pssh!,
