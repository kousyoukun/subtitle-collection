嗯
Hmm.

1283
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,130
我想我知道怎麼做了
l think l know what to do.

1284
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,014
你確定這安全嗎？
Are you sure this is safe?

1285
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,475
當然，完全沒危險
Sure. There's nothing to it.

1286
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:40,937
如果有什麼差錯 就喊出來 一定要夠大聲
Now, if something goes wrong, scream really loud!

1287
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,731
因為戴著這玩意 我聽不太清
Because l can't hear too good with this thing on.

1288
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,234
嘿 拉斐! 把開關按下去!
Hey, Rafi! Get the switch, please.

1289
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,237

1290
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:51,948

1293
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,578
盡量不要動
LUIZ: Now, try not to move!

1294
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,831
這玩意在套頭上 我也看不太清
l can't really see out of this thing, either!

1295
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,673
(DISTORTED SCREAMING)

1296
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,397
嘿 你們在哪兒?
Hey! Where did you go?

1297
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,415
(GROANS) Eww!

1298
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,625
真噁心
Gross.

1299
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,919
但我自由了
But l'm free.

1300
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,921
珠兒，我們自由了
Jewel! Jewel! We're free!

1301
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,547
黏乎乎的 但自由了!
Slimy, but free.

1302
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,758
可能還髒兮兮的 但是總算自由了
Contaminated probably, but free.

1303
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,718
你相信嗎 我們終於...
Can you believe it's finally...

1304
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,929

夥計們 快來 我們走吧!
Come on, guys, let's go!

1308
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,731
我們還在這兒站著幹嗎? 今天可是狂歡節!
What are we standing around for? lt's Carnaval!

1309
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,486

我知道你現在的感受
l know just how you feel.

1313
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,958
看著他們在空中翱翔
Watching them up there

1314
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,294
使你情不自禁想追上他們 把他們咬在嘴裡
makes you want to chase them and grab them in your mouth

1315
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,672
一口咬斷他們的頭
and bite their heads off, huh?

1316
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,883
(LAUGHING)

1317
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,677
我是在玩笑 兄弟
l'm just kidding, bro.

1318
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,096
能追他們 我就滿足了
Yeah, chasing them is plenty.

1319
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:52,277
我要展翅飛翔 就像鳥兒一樣
l'm flying, flying just like a bird!

1320
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,654
珠兒 你就是一隻鳥啊
Jewel, but you are a bird!

1321
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,160
嘿 你要到哪兒去?

1323
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,293
布魯 你怎麼了?

1324
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,129
沒什麼 一切都很好
Nothing. Everything is perfect.

1325
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,755
你去你的雨林 
You'll be off to the rainforest,

1326
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,674
我回到琳達的懷抱 就像之前我們計劃的那樣
l'll be back with Linda, just like we planned.

1327
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,303
嘿 你們兩個! 別廢話了 起飛吧
Hey, birds! Stop yapping and start flapping!

1328
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,512
我們走!
Let's go!

1329
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,307
我想 也許 可能 我...
l guess, l thought, maybe...

1330
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,309
怎麼 你要來明尼蘇達?
What? That you'd come to Minnesota?

1331
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,269
那很好 我想我可以 為你做一條頭巾
Great, l guess l'll knit you a scarf.

1332
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,688
不 我不是這個意思
No, that's not what l meant.

1333
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,857
聽著 珠兒 我可不能一輩子這樣
Look, Jewel, l can't spend my life

1334
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:33,318
你飛到哪兒 我就走路跟到哪兒
walking around following you wherever you're going.

1335
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,029
嘿 你不能飛 又不是我的錯
Hey, it's not my fault you can't fly.

1336
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:39,615
尷尬了
Awkward.

1337
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:40,867
好了 好了
Okay, okay.

1338
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,120
你們知道嗎? 這樣很好 坦誠相待
You know what? This is good. Just clear the air.

1339
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,122
說出你們的心裡話
Just be completely honest with each other.

1340
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,916
說心裡話是吧! 那好 我說心裡話
You want honesty? Fine, l can be honest.

1341
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,126
我不屬於這兒
l don't belong here.

1342
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:53,004
事實上 我一開始就沒想來這兒
ln fact, l never wanted to come here in the first place.

1343
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,131
而且... 而且
And... And...

1344
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,008
你知道嗎?
And you know what?

1345
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,509
我討厭桑巴舞!
l hate samba.

1346
01:08:58,718 --> 01:08:59,719

嘿 這有點扯遠了
Hey! That's a little too far.

1349
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,433
叫那個討厭的鳥收回這句話
Make the mean bird take it back.

1350
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,060
不 我偏說
Yeah, l said it.

1351
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,395
每首歌聽起來都一樣
Every song sounds exactly the same.

1352

You belong together! You are Juliet to his Romeo!

1358
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,245
雖然 他們最後都死了 
Sure, they both die in the end,

1359
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,914
但你們知道我的意思!
but you get my point!

1360
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:31,417
年輕人的戀愛 總是這麼富有戲劇色彩
Young love. Always so melodramatic.

1361
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,921

他們不帶上我就走了
You left without me.

1367
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,769
我被落下了
That's messed up.

1368
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,527

珠兒!

冷靜，冷靜
Temper, temper.

1375

現在跟我來 親愛的 
Now come along, my dear.

1376

我們要去遊行了
We're going to a parade.

1377
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,968
人人都愛遊行
Everybody loves a parade.

1378
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,177
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

1379
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,637
放開我!
Let go of me!

1380
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,973
給我站住！
Hey! Get back here!

1381

Ain't nobody messing with a friend of Pedro, l ain't having it!

lt's on!

1383
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,022
你看見那傢伙的利爪了嗎?
Did you see the talons on that guy?

1384
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:36,149
利爪?
Talons?

1385
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,484
還是下次 再收拾他吧
Maybe it's on next time.

1386
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,694
(SCREAMING)

1387
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,446
拉斐 救命 救命!

1388
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,120
拉斐爾 別跟著我了
Rafael, quit following me.

1389
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,746
你走錯方向了 
You're going in the wrong direction.

1390
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,582
狂歡節不是在那邊嗎?
lsn't Carnaval that way?

1391
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,250
我不去狂歡節
l'm not going to Carnaval.

1392
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,793
我是要回家
No, l'm going home.

1393
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:57,253
但是你不是很喜歡狂歡節嗎?
But l thought you loved Carnaval.

1394
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,673
是的 但是我更愛我的家人
l do. But l love my family much more.

1395
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,676
這是我用這裡作的選擇
And that's a choice l made with this.

1396
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,678
而不是這兒
Not with this.

1397
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,305
- 布魯! 布魯!  - 布魯! 
NICO: Blu! PEDRO: Hey, Blu! Blu!

忍者利爪的鳳頭鸚鵡
With big ninja talons!

1400
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,019
這只鸚鵡醜的很 從哪兒看都很醜
This cockatoo was ugly! Anyway, that's not the point.

1401
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,438
然後珠兒遇到他了，就被他抓走了
And then Jewel was there, and he snatched Jewel up.

1402
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,939
然後他就類似：
Like, he snatched her up. And then he was like,

1403
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,691
「你要跟我走嗎，小公主？」
"You're coming with me, you little princess."

1404
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,401
然後珠兒就這樣 啪! 啪!
And Jewel was like,

1405
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,861
"我不是公主 放開我"
"l ain't your princess, leave me alone."

1406
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,529
- 然後我就 "嘿!"  - 然後他就 "啥!"
And l was like, "What?" Then he was like, "What?"

1407
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,156
夠了！告訴我究竟怎麼了！
Stop! Just tell me what happened.

1408
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:26,491
他把珠兒抓了起來
He got Jewel, man!

1409
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,034
他還要帶珠兒去遊行
And he's taking her to the parade.

1410
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,287
這都是我的錯
This is all my fault.

1411
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,664
我們起飛！
Let's fly.

1412
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,711
狂歡節 我們來了!

1413
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,881
嘿 臭狗 把我噴回來了
Hey, dog, l'm drowning back here!

1414
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,801
這趟飛行你會濕透的!
You will get wet on this ride!

1415
