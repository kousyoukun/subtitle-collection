1
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:05,698
I'll give my heart just to one man

2
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,510
The greatest love since time began

3
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:13,347
He'll come my way and he'll be strong

4
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:17,218
And he will sing me love's sweet song

5
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,872
- What happened, Mr. Höfgen?
- What do you want?

6
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:14,280
I don't need you now!
Go to hell!

7
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:35,106
We're invited to a boring banquet.
Sorry, but we have to leave now.

8
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,827
Can't you sit with us, Dora?

9
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,303
No, we're much too late.

10
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:42,150
Sorry, good evening.

11
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,932
I wanted to say you were
marvelous tonight.

12
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:48,067
It was fantastic. Thank God I saw it.

13
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:53,504
You fraud, you didn't see the show.
Never mind, you're talented.

14
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,943
Me? Talented? Say it louder.

15
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,167
Yes, you're very talented,
Herr Höfgen.

16
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:04,809
I'm sure you'll soon be able to show
just how talented you are.

17
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,204
I must be going, goodbye.

18
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,790
- Böck. Seven marks.
- But Hendrik...

19
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:25,191
...if you need money
I can lend you fifty marks.

20
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,062
This is men's business.
Böck likes giving money.

21
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,985
Good evening, Miklas.
Thank you.

22
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:35,326
So...

23
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:42,175
...Doctor Kroge lets me starve.

24
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:46,088
Höfgen, you old sinner!
Take a seat.

25
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,357
Well, Director,
how'd you like the show?

26
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:54,566
What's getting you down, Hendrik?

27
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:59,011
That I'm a provincial actor.

28
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,319
Is that all? Nothing else?

29
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,027
Hello.

30
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,281
You're late.

31
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:38,278
One day, I'll come to fetch you.

32
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,575
Don't you dread that, Heinz?

33
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:44,228
- Please don't call me Heinz.
- Why not? That's your name.

34
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:47,042
I dislike it. Understand?

35
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,438
Perfectly, Heinz.

36
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,272
You can't even drink a beer like
a man who feels like drinking one.

37
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,318
Shall we start?

38
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:58,498
What was that about beer?

39
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,361
It's not your style,
simply to call for a beer.

40
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:07,622
"A beer, please" sounds
phony when you say it.

41
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:09,703
I don't drink, Juliette.

42
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,767
I know, Heinz. Take your shoes off.

43
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,070
Come on...

44
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:37,409
One, two...

45
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,608
One, two...

46
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,271
...one, two, three, four...

47
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,483
On one...

48
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:01,476
Don't fall down now.

49
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,665
Faster!

50
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:13,855
Faster!
Show me what you can do.

51
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,311
You want to be an actor
and show off for money, too?

52
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,792
You comical picture of misery.

53
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:41,825
If you liked this music,
you wouldn't get tired.

54
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,351
You always laugh at me, Juliette.

55
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,919
I can't cry. Would you
love me if I could cry?

56
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:53,734
I love you anyway.

57
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:57,576
You only love yourself, Heinz,
and even then not enough.

58
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,607
Keep talking.
What you say is very nice.

59
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:07,335
Your only concern is your face
being devoid of human expression.

60
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,871
It's a mask, you hear?

61
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,655
I, too, have skin and bones
and body weight...

62
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:18,950
...and eyebrows and fingernails,
just like you.

63
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:26,407
I, too, feel the cold.
I can be hungry and thirsty.

64
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:28,196
I, too, think of my mother.

65
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:31,811
And I know there are
Philistines and Communists.

66
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:36,035
But my eyes are not my eyes.

67
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:42,689
My legs are not mine,
my face is not mine.

68
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:47,843
My name is not my name,
because I am an actor!

69
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:52,259
Do you know what it
means to be an actor?

70
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,872
An actor is a mask...

71
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:00,543
...among human beings.

72
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,330
Juliette...

73
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,694
Juliette...

74
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,809
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have the honor...

75
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:15,427
...of welcoming you to
the first reading of the play.

76
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:21,445
May I introduce our guest,
Nicoletta von Niebuhr...

77
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,406
...who will play the female
lead in this production.

78
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:35,329
Do you mind if my friend
watches the rehearsal?

79
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:36,998
I have no objection.

80
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:42,694
- Two cognacs, please.
- Yes, director.

81
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,025
Coming up right away.

82
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:47,647
Three beers, please.

83
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,079
There you go.

84
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,738
Please excuse me.

85
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,514
Please excuse me.

86
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:02,182
Father Hansemann...

87
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,703
Hendrik, will we look
lovely in this play?

88
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,857
We are lovely.

89
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,376
May I introduce my best friend,
Barbara Bruckner?

90
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:10,758
Nice to meet you.

91
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:12,126
What?

92
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,786
There's a nice smell of
lavender about you.

93
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,375
Can you smell the lavender, too?

94
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,083
How shocking, on a man.
But I need it like my daily bread.

95
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:25,317
A little on the temples is
as good as a night's sleep.

96
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:29,127
Sleep would be better,
but there's no time.

97
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,744
A beer and a mineral water.

98
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,359
We'll hear what he has to say...

99
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:39,240
...use the good bits,
then play it our way.

100
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:42,116
He's good, but old-fashioned.

101
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:45,065
The future of Hamburg
Art Theater is me.

102
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:48,008
I mean the two of us.

103
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,439
Most of the plays here
are shallow bourgeois stuff.

104
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:58,567
But we visualize theater
that will involve everyone...

105
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:00,869
...the workers, the dockers.

106
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,423
Where will you perform this theater?

107
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:07,105
It doesn't matter.
In the docks, factories, cellars.

108
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,505
They asked me about the play.
We promised it for last week.

109
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:13,416
Let's get this opening night over first.

110
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,112
We must prove that theater
has a political function.

111
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,269
Before it can be political or
revolutionary, it first has to be good.

112
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:25,791
Which actors will be in
this sort of theater?

113
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,963
All who think like us. Even workers.

114
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:32,099
It's what we say, not how we say it.

115
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:36,031
But I've no qualms if
Hendrik stages our plays.

116
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,005
Go on. Why are you looking at me?

117
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,281
Am I not allowed to?

118
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,931
If it pleases you, go ahead.

119
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,219
Without you, I'll be finished, Barbara.

120
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,847
There's too much evil in me.

121
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:52,512
Alone, I'm too weak to overcome it,
but you could help me.

122
00:15:55,498 --> 00:16:00,451
I can't talk anymore. So many
thoughts are just parts I've played.

123
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,227
I love you, Barbara.

124
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,369
I'm in love. With a woman.

125
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:36,199
Juliette, am I a good looking man?

126
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:40,516
I've never seen you on stage.
Maybe you're handsome, but...

127
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,675
...frankly, I've never found
you good looking, but...

128
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,894
...sometimes your cold cheating eyes
are those of a sad child.

129
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,749
You do it well.

130
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,611
Who have you fallen for?

131
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:59,391
- A girl.
- Great.

132
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,765
You falling in love...

133
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:05,346
One day you may just learn
how to walk, not just dance.

134
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:10,758
Love the girl, Heinz, and don't
tell me anything about her.

135
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:16,258
- Do we keep in touch?
- Yes.

136
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,228
You know what? I'm coming with you.

137
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,839
I have nothing to lose, Heinz.

138
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:40,004
Are you crazy?

139
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,796
See a psychiatrist.

140
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,702
Though I'm sure you wouldn't
dare talk about yourself.

141
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,981
Go, Heinz. We'll meet soon anyway...

142
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,503
...even if I don't want to.

143
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:09,575
Grandmother, have you a moment?

144
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:15,651
- I'd like to introduce...
- Your fiancé.

145
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:19,015
I have to take a closer look
at my new grandson.

146
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:25,830
Not bad at all.

147
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:32,736
Excuse my mother please,
she will be here shortly.

148
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,129
I assume you know,
my dear Höfgen...

149
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:42,950
...that loving mothers rarely want
their only sons to leave the nest.

150
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,710
Hello, Sebastian.

151
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:50,434
That is Sebastian.

152
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:58,914
Mom.

153
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:08,289
I'm really pleased.

154
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:10,371
Barbara, my dear child.

155
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,151
And I'm Nicoletta von Niebuhr...

156
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:16,640
...the bride's best friend,
almost her sister.

157
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:23,489
Often, the bridegroom's mistress.
Only on stage, of course.

158
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:26,244
May I call you Aunt Bella?

159
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:28,615
But of course, Nicoletta.

160
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,890
Let us leave the ladies to themselves.

161
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:41,574
I'd like to show you my garden.

162
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:44,521
I'd love to see it.

163
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,876
Have you unsettling memories, too?

164
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:53,858
You know, Barbara,
memories that give you the creeps?

165
00:20:55,753 --> 00:21:01,187
When I was about twelve,
I got into our school choir.

166
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:07,399
I was overjoyed. I thought I could
sing better than the other boys.

167
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,618
We had to sing in church
at some wedding.

168
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:19,936
I wanted to show off.
I was so proud of my soprano voice.

169
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:24,100
I had a great idea. I sang
one octave higher than the others.

170
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,145
As I stood there, proudly singing...

171
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:32,959
...the music teacher looked at me
more in disgust than disapproval...

172
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,881
...and he said softly,
"Just keep quiet".

173
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,558
Do you understand?

174
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:42,147
Softly and dryly he said,
"Just keep quiet".

175
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,511
When I felt I was singing
like an angel.

176
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:48,169
Do you have such memories?

177
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,198
No.

178
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,804
You've never felt
ashamed in your life.

179
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:59,939
I often have. That was the first time.

180
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:04,833
I often have to feel awfully
ashamed of myself.

181
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,934
So ashamed,
I could sink down into hell.

182
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:12,738
Do you understand me?

183
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:18,150
This is the basement room.
The window faces the street.

184
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,203
Here's a lamp post and here, too.
Behind it the bakery...

185
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,055
- ...with workers' wives lined up.
- Stop!

186
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,897
Great.

187
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:33,058
Ms. Schult, you come up
past the window.

188
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:36,325
Barbara, can you put a
lamp post here...

189
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:40,003
...with a light to dazzle the audience?

190
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:45,472
Then you come here. "I'm Widow
Queck who hasn't paid the rent".

191
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:51,175
We could have several more
lamp posts in the auditorium...

192
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:56,008
...so people feel they're
really in their filthy street.

193
00:22:56,105 --> 00:23:01,735
We'll have posters, recent political
slogans, all jumbled up.

194
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:07,591
At the back, a grocer's shop,
with nothing to sell, of course.

195
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,846
Everything in the hall must
express what we talk about.

196
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,094
Two policemen can patrol the rows
and stare at the audience.

197
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:22,409
An end to passive watching, actors
and public isolated from each other.

198
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:28,256
The public must play an active part.
The days of the peepshow are over.

199
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:31,744
The actor is only one element
of the performance...

200
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,704
...not it's focal point.

201
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:39,715
The hall, lights, walls, movements,
sounds, all must blend into a whole.

202
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:45,219
Only then shall we have real theater.
The workers need total theater.

203
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:48,704
One that shocks and arouses.

204
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:55,583
I am the widow Queck, who cannot
pay the rent. I work for the baker.

205
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:58,983
It's the only way I can feed
my seven hungry children.

206
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:01,896
The half-hour has to be paid for.

207
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:04,863
We've been waiting half an hour.

208
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:07,751
Here reigns logic and hunger.

209
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:12,640
I already owe you 31 marks
and 25 pfennigs.

210
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,519
I've had nothing these past few days.

211
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:19,456
Silly goose!

212
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,326
Sabotaging our work!
Do you think I don't know why?

213
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:28,387
Miklas or one of his damn party
friends has put you up to it!

214
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,970
- What do you want from me?
- Why don't you prompt her?!

215
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:38,720
Never mind! Revolutionary Theatre
can't be staged with provincial hams.

216
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:42,306
With amateurs, you can't
create any sort of theatre.

217
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:45,704
Even revolutions need professionals!

218
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:53,797
I'll buy you a drink to celebrate.
Revolutionary Theater is a big flop.

219
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:56,680
You're beside yourself with joy.

220
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:02,656
Hello.

221
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,872
Two stiff ones, Hansemann.

222
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,708
How about another
rebellious evening?

223
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:18,311
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

224
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,129
What, me?

225
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:24,678
- Good morning.
- Morning.

226
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,459
You're still half asleep.

227
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:29,284
I'm awake.

228
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:36,105
I've even phoned our grocer, he's
a bit impatient over our large bill.

229
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:41,512
I'm sorry. I don't present a picture
of early morning freshness.

230
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:48,224
If I, too, went riding every morning
I'd probably look more attractive.

231
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:52,518
But in our circles,
such noble sport is not customary.

232
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:55,934
The offended husband, as in Molière.

233
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,732
Oh, be quiet.

234
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:04,449
It's not customary to sit all night
at a Nazi thug's table.

235
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,447
- Miklas is not a thug.
- All Nazis are thugs.

236
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,344
You must a void their company.
Their dirt rubs off on you.

237
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:20,901
But you can't understand. It's your
family's well known liberalism.

238
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:26,850
No political beliefs, just curiosity.
Ideologies are psychological quirks.

239
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,043
I feel sorry for Miklas. He gets
small parts and earns very little.

240
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:36,579
You all treat him very badly. He's
at a loss, that's why he's with them.

241
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:40,548
So much understanding
for that lousy brat.

242
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:43,966
How do you think they'd treat us
if they came to power?

243
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,146
God forbid.

244
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:51,748
And yet you sit and chat with him.
It's you bourgeois tolerance.

245
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,338
This understanding of one's enemy.

246
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:59,111
I'm sure you could even
excuse Fascist terrorism.

247
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:03,171
Your liberalism might even
get used to dictatorship.

248
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:04,834
No, thank you.

249
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:06,982
May I remark...

250
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:11,359
...it's common practice to eat an egg
from its shell and with salt.

251
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:15,426
I know, in the Bruckner household
you eat it from a glass...

252
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,399
...with six spices,
and that's very original...

253
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:23,907
...but no need to make fun of those
unaccustomed to such originality.

254
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:41,379
- Who's juvenile lead in Halberstadt?
- Herbert Boltz.

255
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:43,749
Where's
Ms. Türkheim-Gawernitz now?

256
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:44,994
In Heidelberg.

257
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:47,465
- And Hannelore Kühn.
- Mannheim.

258
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:50,343
- And who's Othello there?
- Max Krause.

259
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:52,547
- And Iago?
- Johannes Fiedler.

260
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,398
- And Desdemona in Leipzig?
- Käthe Müttel.

261
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,156
Who's the ingénue in Jena?

262
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,908
A stupid cow called Lotte Lindenthal.

263
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:04,127
Why is Lotte Lindenthal a stupid cow?

264
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:06,249
I don't know, but she is.

265
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:09,128
I know why you insult her.

266
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:12,641
She's the friend of
a National Socialist leader.

267
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:18,660
I'm only moderately interested
in the names and titles of her lovers.

268
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:22,341
Must be quite a long list...

269
00:28:22,442 --> 00:28:24,133
Watch your tongue, Höfgen!

270
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:32,384
You won't insult a lady because she's
in the Nazi German worker's party...

271
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,749
...and the friend of a German hero.

272
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:38,335
You won't stand for it?

273
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:41,222
My, my...

274
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:44,932
Stop it, you're drunk.

275
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:49,890
I'm not. On the contrary.

276
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:53,633
Apparently I'm the only one here
with a spark of honor left.

277
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:57,632
Nobody in this Jew-ridden business
cares if a lady is insulted.

278
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:00,549
Let me!

279
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:03,614
No!

280
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,822
Go away!

281
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:12,484
I'll gladly believe you're not drunk.

282
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:16,550
You won't make that an excuse, then.

283
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,497
As for this Jew-ridden
business you're in...

284
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,862
...you won't suffer it much longer.

285
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:24,774
That I promise you.

286
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:27,780
Perhaps you're right.

287
00:29:28,553 --> 00:29:31,969
I agree, the fellow's behavior
was intolerable...

288
00:29:32,073 --> 00:29:36,099
...but I can't just fire a poor,
sick man like that.

289
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,655
Sick? He's not sick at all.

290
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,454
Why this indecision and compromise?
It's just like our government parties.

291
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,944
Excuse me, Barbara.

292
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,879
We must show this murderous
pack it can't get away with it.

293
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:54,247
I beg you, don't insist that
he be sacked on the spot.

294
00:29:54,346 --> 00:29:59,135
It's punishment enough that he
won't be hired for next season.

295
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:03,300
He has no idea what he said
last night, he just went wild.

296
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,928
I'm amazed, Otto.

297
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,010
I'm really amazed that you,
of all people, should say that.

298
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:14,496
I don't want him made a martyr.

299
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,559
- In the political situation...
- Excuse me if I interrupt.

300
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:24,164
This conversation is quite pointless.
The case is simple.

301
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:28,804
Either Miklas leaves the theater...

302
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:31,240
...or I do.

303
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:33,159
That's nonsense.

304
00:30:33,257 --> 00:30:37,764
Higher, higher!

305
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:28,354
Higher, higher!

306
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:34,598
Enough! This isn't a funeral march!

307
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:36,934
Again.

308
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,835
Lights!

309
00:32:17,257 --> 00:32:18,534
Sorry, to interrupt.

310
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:21,765
Dr. Kroge asks you to
approve the next poster.

311
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:24,451
I must take it to the printer.

312
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:32,128
Can't I get my name spelled
correctly even in this theatre?

313
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:35,684
My name is not Henrik, but Hendrik!

314
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:39,906
Hendrik Höfgen.

315
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:42,818
One day they'll all
have to mark my name.

316
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,410
Try to understand, doctor.
I can't and won't tie myself down.

317
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:53,704
It's a great strain
to stay under contract.

318
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:55,624
I must be free. Free.

319
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,905
I can't be a provincial matinee idol.

320
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,626
No, no, I don't want to be that.

321
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:05,544
You want to leave Hamburg for good?

322
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,714
I don't know yet.

323
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:17,856
The Professor invited me to a Berlin
guest appearance. One never knows.

324
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,806
By the way, Dora Martin
will be my partner.

325
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:24,676
Good. Then accept the offer.

326
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:27,582
Thank you.

327
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,842
Berlin.

328
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:36,579
Thank you, ladies. Till tomorrow.

329
00:34:36,682 --> 00:34:38,024
Goodbye.

330
00:34:43,113 --> 00:34:45,382
So you are Höfgen.

331
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,577
You have friends here.

332
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:52,707
Some of them, who understand
theater, recommended you to me.

333
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:59,617
Your father-in-law, too,
when we met at the ministry.

334
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:04,357
And Dora Martin, as well.

335
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:16,159
In real life I may seem a bit
nondescript, but not, I hope on stage.

336
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:22,336
My father-in-law once aptly described
my ability to transform myself.

337
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:28,998
Well, we'll give you a try.

338
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:37,479
Don't expect too much.
I'm not offering anything big.

339
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:43,491
You are probably used to a
reasonable income in Hamburg.

340
00:35:43,593 --> 00:35:48,165
Here you'll have less.
Have you expensive tastes?

341
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:53,794
Money doesn't interest me.
My needs are modest.

342
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,011
All I need every day is a clean shirt
and a drop of cologne.

343
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:03,688
Discuss the details with
Miss Bernhardt.

344
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,495
Please give my regards
to your father-in-law.

345
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,587
- Hendrik Höfgen.
- Oh, yes. Bernhardt.

346
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,634
Here's your contract.

347
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:14,848
Thank you.

348
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:17,826
- May I?
- Please.

349
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:27,780
700 marks a month, less tax.
You agree to play as cast.

350
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:41,184
Please give these flowers...

351
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,956
...and this card to Ms. Martin, will you?

352
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,148
THANKS!

353
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,372
Well, Hendrik Höfgen.

354
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:14,114
Now you're a beginner again.

355
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:19,075
Hamburg's fame, routine and
security all lie behind you.

356
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:24,390
Now you must summon
up all your strength.

357
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:36,094
And we'll work off that blubber.

358
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:04,806
- Who is that?
- Dora Martin's Hamburg actor lover.

359
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:08,484
- No, Miss Bernhardt's.
- You're misinformed, dear.

360
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:13,572
So glad you were able to come,
despite all your work.

361
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:16,514
May I introduce some
of your admirers?

362
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,767
Mr. Davidson of the London Times.
Cäser von Muck, Mr. Müller-Andreä.

363
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:41,192
Mind you aren't influenced by
the prevailing culture Bolshevism.

364
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,816
What do you mean?

365
00:39:43,178 --> 00:39:48,361
German culture can only be renewed
if it returns to its national roots...

366
00:39:48,457 --> 00:39:50,792
...to its essence of blood and soil.

367
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:56,673
Russian ravings or French farces are
alien to the spirit the nation needs.

368
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:18,182
Have you met Mr. Höfgen?

369
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,438
Berlin's new star, according to
tomorrow's London Times.

370
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:25,407
I've seen you on stage.
You danced, didn't you?

371
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:29,987
Yes, I like dancing.
I had a good teacher.

372
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,835
I'd like to model your head.

373
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:41,887
No neck-tie and no gold we've got
We're just a very shabby lot

374
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:45,664
At which the bourgeois spits

375
00:40:46,122 --> 00:40:50,050
The bourgeois with polished boots
And medals on morning suits

376
00:40:50,153 --> 00:40:55,074
And every morning he ablutes
for church, or for the Ritz

377
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:02,305
Where does the bourgeois get it all?
His guns his celebration ball?

378
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:05,123
He steals it where he can

379
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,471
He makes it hard for us to rob
Takes it all, the greedy slob

380
00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:14,280
Exploits the poor and wrecks the job
of every working man

381
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:22,275
Oh, if so wealthy I could be,
Commit like him grand larceny

382
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:25,094
All honored since my birth

383
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:31,016
If then I met someone I knew,
You filthy lot, I'd spit at you

384
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:36,743
That's all you dogs are worth!

385
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,535
Get the Jews out of here!

386
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:00,421
They are completely drunk.

387
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:06,882
Now one of the most famous
State Theater actors, Hendrik Höfgen.

388
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:15,519
Forget State Theater and fame.
I am your comrade Hendrik Höfgen.

389
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:24,831
What does the proletariat want?
That nobody should rule!

390
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:31,207
What does the proletariat want?
That nobody should rule!

391
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:36,617
Nobody shall give orders
Nobody shall be a slave

392
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:41,544
Freedom, equality for all souls

393
00:42:42,313 --> 00:42:44,680
I'll dictate. Headline:

394
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:51,141
Actor Höfgen wins
Berlin workers' hearts overnight.

395
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:52,963
New paragraph.

396
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:56,258
- Hendrik?
- Hello.

397
00:42:57,546 --> 00:43:03,459
I bought this picture at the
antique dealer. You don't mind?

398
00:43:03,593 --> 00:43:05,219
Why should I mind?

399
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:08,385
You can admire it
while I go and change.

400
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,647
I love you, Barbara. Not only
your father and grandmother.

401
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:50,600
I love you... I, Hendrik Höfgen.

402
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,356
Welcome to my home,
dear Sebastian.

403
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,333
The theater awaits me.

404
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:15,841
Up!

405
00:45:21,257 --> 00:45:22,118
Up!

406
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:23,937
Two!

407
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:25,633
Three!

408
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:27,265
Four!

409
00:45:27,785 --> 00:45:28,800
Five!

410
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:29,952
Six!

411
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:34,048
Führer!
We are our people's strength!

412
00:45:34,153 --> 00:45:36,804
We shall create a new world!

413
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,653
- What's your father's job?
- Road digger!

414
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,641
- And your father's?
- Farmer!

415
00:45:41,737 --> 00:45:44,901
- And yours?
- Teacher. He educates us!

416
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:48,450
- And your father?
- Baker. He bakes our bread!

417
00:45:48,553 --> 00:45:51,074
Mine's a miller. He grinds our grain!

418
00:45:51,177 --> 00:45:53,152
A doctor. He makes us healthy!

419
00:45:53,257 --> 00:45:55,232
Bricklayer. He builds our houses!

420
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:57,094
- Conductor!
- Electrician!

421
00:45:57,193 --> 00:46:01,285
We are the sons of one people,
we all have the same goal!

422
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:04,102
Unity and strength!
We follow the Führer!

423
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:11,076
No. That's not convincing enough.
Say it like this...

424
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,959
- Again... one, two, three.
- Unity and strength!

425
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:17,254
- Again... one, two, three.
- Unity and strength!

426
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:18,368
Again!

427
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:20,328
Unity and strength!

428
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:23,272
- Louder! Again!
- Unity and strength!

429
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:24,709
We follow the Führer!

430
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:30,047
Blood is a very special juice...

431
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:37,669
...let us in depths of sensuousness
assuage our burning passions.

432
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,966
No bounds and goals are set for you.

433
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:44,710
You find your pleasure.
A fleeing treasure.

434
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:50,558
May you enjoy the prize you get.
Help yourself and don't be coy.

435
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:53,121
But listen, it's not a question of joy.

436
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:56,542
To knowledge I'm devoted,
most painful gratification.

437
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,465
Most hateful love,
most vexing stimulation.

438
00:46:59,562 --> 00:47:05,890
Believe me, who countless years
on this hard nourishment has fed.

439
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:11,940
That from cradle to the grave, no
human can digest so stale a bread.

440
00:47:12,106 --> 00:47:16,197
Believe me, worlds
celestial and infernal...

441
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:19,015
...for one divinity were made.

442
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:22,113
He exists in eternal light.

443
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:27,302
But us, into the darkness, has
conveyed there's day and night alone.

444
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:28,612
Yet I want that!

445
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:33,797
That's well worth hearing.
But there's one thing I fear.

446
00:47:33,897 --> 00:47:36,647
For time is short, but art is long.

447
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:41,285
If I thought you sought more teaching,
cultivate a poet fond of preaching.

448
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,457
Let his thoughts wander.

449
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:46,977
And every noble quality upon
your brow let him bestow...

450
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:49,634
...the lion's courage,
the buck's swiftness.

451
00:47:49,738 --> 00:47:52,738
The Italian's fiery blood,
the north's enduring pluck.

452
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:56,802
He'll teach you the secret vile
of magnanimity steeped in guile.

453
00:47:56,937 --> 00:48:01,607
May his youthful drives uncover
to make of you an ardent lover.

454
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:09,703
I'd like to meet a scholar of such fame
to Microcosm I'd change his name.

455
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:15,749
So what am I, if it's not possible
the paragon of humanity to attain...

456
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,792
...towards all my senses strain?

457
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:22,152
You're in the end just what you are.

458
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:26,057
Put on the wigs of a million curls.

459
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:30,563
Put your feet in elevating socks.

460
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:35,657
You'll stay forever what you are!

461
00:48:57,321 --> 00:48:58,696
Bravo!

462
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,679
Wonderful!
You were fantastic, Hendrik.

463
00:49:07,785 --> 00:49:11,298
You were born to play Mephisto.

464
00:49:11,402 --> 00:49:14,817
You say that with a
touch of malice, Dora.

465
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:17,856
Not true, I don't detest
people for what they are.

466
00:49:17,962 --> 00:49:21,890
- Anyway, thank you for coming.
- Let's skip the clichés.

467
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:25,438
- What's your next project?
- I'm learning English.

468
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,335
English? Why?

469
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:31,295
- I'll be working in America.
- But why?

470
00:49:31,498 --> 00:49:34,662
Here the curtain's descending.
Haven't you noticed?

471
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:40,774
You're at the top here, hit after hit.
Thousands adore you. So why go?

472
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:44,670
Thousands! Soon they'll be
raving about others.

473
00:49:46,058 --> 00:49:50,281
There'll always be theater,
no matter what happens in Germany.

474
00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:53,952
No matter what happens in Germany?
You really mean that?

475
00:49:56,041 --> 00:50:00,930
Well, all the best.
I'm leaving in a few days.

476
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,319
In a few days?

477
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:06,847
I don't want to wait till it's too late.

478
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:09,896
But you'll always do well, Hendrik...

479
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:12,805
...no matter what happens
in Germany.

480
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,140
It's open.

481
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:31,265
Mephisto, I never lock the door.
Need neither bolts nor life insurance.

482
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:35,362
- I bet you've taken one out.
- I need no life insurance.

483
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:38,597
Sit down, sir, in my new home.

484
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:41,858
You could have
gotten me a nicer flat.

485
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:46,467
- Have you registered with the police?
- Yes, sir.

486
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:49,220
What did the landlord say?

487
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:53,348
Nothing. He was drunk,
humming a song...

488
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,871
No neck-ties, no gold we've got...

489
00:50:55,978 --> 00:50:59,589
He gave me the key and I moved in.

490
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:07,367
I've been longing to see you.

491
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:13,313
- And how's your wife?
- She's with her father, thank God.

492
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:18,120
They're worried about the Republic.

493
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:30,982
In Hamburg, the foreigners were also
very worried about Germany...

494
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,487
...about German culture,
whose Number-One-Parrot you are.

495
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:40,198
As if a peril threatened it. What are
the Jews planning against Germany?

496
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:42,632
Even the whores wonder...

497
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,723
...and they don't care about
the pant color as long as it has a fly.

498
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:50,503
Barbara understands politics,
doesn't she?

499
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,864
Is she keeping an eye on you?

500
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:58,503
No. Mostly her opinions
are the opposite of mine.

501
00:51:58,634 --> 00:52:02,660
- Have you told her so?
- No. What point would there be?

502
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:05,601
Words don't say everything.

503
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:12,737
I'd like very much to sleep with you.

504
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:15,238
Shall I make up the bed?

505
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:17,022
Yes!

506
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:23,016
Hendrik! Hendrik!

507
00:52:25,481 --> 00:52:28,296
Hendrik, wake up! Didn't you here?

508
00:52:28,873 --> 00:52:30,564
You're here already?

509
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:33,119
I came on the early train,
because of you.

510
00:52:33,225 --> 00:52:36,487
- What's the matter?
- When did you go to bed?

511
00:52:36,745 --> 00:52:40,225
I'm tired. I was tossing all night.
Why?

512
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:44,040
The Nazis have won the elections.
You know who became Chancellor?

513
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:45,152
No.

514
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:51,590
Do you hear that?

515
00:52:52,842 --> 00:52:54,467
Do you hear that?

516
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:02,217
That Bohemian corporal has
become Chancellor?

517
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:03,622
Here, read it.

518
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:07,877
I thought there was nothing
to fear from the Nazis.

519
00:53:09,578 --> 00:53:12,709
Remember that business with Miklas?

520
00:53:15,018 --> 00:53:20,233
That could have unpleasant
consequences. What do we do now?

521
00:53:22,185 --> 00:53:26,463
Keep a clear head and don't panic.

522
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:32,254
So, the Austrian clown has
become Reichs-Chancellor.

523
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:38,433
But there still is the opposition, no?
Communists and Social Democrats.

524
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,824
They'll make sure he doesn't
get too big for his boots.

525
00:53:43,114 --> 00:53:46,692
Perhaps there'll even
be armed resistance.

526
00:53:48,874 --> 00:53:55,071
And even if the Nazis stay in power,
why should it concern me?

527
00:53:55,177 --> 00:53:56,639
I'm from the Rhineland.

528
00:53:56,745 --> 00:54:00,771
So are my parents.
What can happen to us?

529
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:04,167
On top of that, I'm an actor. No?

530
00:54:05,065 --> 00:54:10,629
I go to the theater, play my parts,
then go back home. That's all.

531
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:14,024
Some people are leaving a country...

532
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:17,831
...where a career in the arts
is now impossible.

533
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:22,337
People will think you don't care
about anything beyond the limelight?

534
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:27,079
There were elections in a democratic
state. One party won, that's all.

535
00:54:27,178 --> 00:54:31,935
I've never been interested
in politics, so why now?

536
00:54:32,074 --> 00:54:35,073
Don't you realize
what's happening here?

537
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:42,659
Don't answer it. I'm not here,
I'm sick. Say what you want.

538
00:54:45,322 --> 00:54:49,512
Is that any solution? To lock
yourself in, to hide, not be at home?

539
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:54,977
Is that all you can think of,
instead of taking a definite stand?

540
00:54:55,114 --> 00:54:59,554
Definite... this is my answer!
Hamlet! Shakespeare!

541
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:03,454
Either we take a stand or go,
if our freedom is in danger.

542
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:07,456
This is the only form of freedom
for me, for an actor.

543
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:11,073
You can't hide behind Shakespeare,
on the stage.

544
00:55:11,178 --> 00:55:16,360
Barbara, I'm an actor.
An actor in Germany at all times.

545
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,304
You can go away.
Your father is a famous writer.

546
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:22,849
You can design sets anywhere,
or buy antiques.

547
00:55:22,954 --> 00:55:25,768
But I need the German language!

548
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:29,859
I need the motherland, don't you see?

549
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:49,604
- Who's there?
- Otto.

550
00:55:49,705 --> 00:55:51,199
- Who?
- Otto.

551
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:55,909
- I must talk to you.
- You want some coffee?

552
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,603
- No, thanks.
- Tea?

553
00:55:57,705 --> 00:56:02,594
Act with us again. It's the only reply
we can give to these events.

554
00:56:02,697 --> 00:56:06,527
An appearance by all of us,
a common front.

555
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:08,935
So we don't lose our future.

556
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:13,954
You just want to divide the audience?
We must work out our tactics.

557
00:56:14,057 --> 00:56:16,545
Tactics will force us to our knees.

558
00:56:16,649 --> 00:56:19,519
We must fight this
crushing demagogy.

559
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:26,368
It's our job to tell the hesitators:
Now is the time to resist dictatorship!

560
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:28,361
Otto, in the first place, we're actors...

561
00:56:28,457 --> 00:56:31,457
No, not a protest on the street.
I'm talking about the stage.

562
00:56:31,657 --> 00:56:34,276
Still, I think we should
wait a few days.

563
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,831
We must do something
immediately. Tonight.

564
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:43,394
Otto, I'd rather stay
with the reserves.

565
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:54,115
Thank God
I've no performance today.

566
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,064
GERMAN REICHS-MAIL

567
00:57:11,146 --> 00:57:14,528
Film contract, locations in Budapest...

568
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:20,032
...leading role.
Production Manager Altenburger.

569
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:30,463
She really is a beauty.
She's sitting by the side altar.

570
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,399
Cut! Very good!
The second one.

571
00:57:34,986 --> 00:57:41,248
Now the scene where they follow her
to the Fishermen's Bastion.

572
00:57:51,754 --> 00:57:53,161
What's going on?

573
00:57:53,322 --> 00:57:54,947
What's going on?

574
00:57:55,273 --> 00:57:57,095
Are we done for today?
Can we go?

575
00:57:57,193 --> 00:58:00,041
- The Reichstag was burned down.
- What?

576
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:04,130
They say the communists set fire to it.

577
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:17,411
Your wife wants you
to join her in Paris.

578
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:22,596
She didn't dare phone you. Don't go
back to Berlin. I'm moving to Vienna.

579
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:27,518
Many of your Berlin friends have
vanished lately. Otto Ulrichs is one.

580
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:32,193
We must be prepared for anything.
I fear we'll never be able to return.

581
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:38,503
The Nazis have blacklists.
Your wife and you are on them.

582
00:58:38,729 --> 00:58:43,432
Please, never go back to Berlin.
Hendrik, promise me that.

583
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,697
Please!

584
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:08,767
Cheers, and many thanks!

585
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:13,153
Cheers!

586
00:59:13,706 --> 00:59:16,324
To the most beautiful
actress in Europe!

587
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,541
When are you going home?

588
00:59:46,217 --> 00:59:49,064
I'll stay a few more days in Budapest.

589
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:53,187
Then I'm going to see about
a contract in Vienna.

590
00:59:53,353 --> 00:59:55,622
I understand you, Hendrik.

591
00:59:56,522 --> 01:00:01,639
I'll tell you now, I'm not going
back to Germany, either.

592
01:00:01,737 --> 01:00:04,104
I signed you for this part...

593
01:00:04,202 --> 01:00:08,610
...so you, too, could slip away,
if you want to.

594
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:13,442
The film studio gave me your
address in Budapest.

595
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:16,677
I hope my letter reaches you.
I'm in Berlin now.

596
01:00:16,778 --> 01:00:19,080
I've landed a part in a comedy.

597
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,039
During the shoot I met the
actress Lotte Lindenthal.

598
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:28,096
She's friendly with a National
Socialist who's very powerful now.

599
01:00:28,202 --> 01:00:33,603
She's wonderful. She never flaunts
what great influence she has.

600
01:00:33,706 --> 01:00:39,783
I told her you were abroad and didn't
dare return, for certain reasons.

601
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:41,637
What's the man afraid of?

602
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:46,211
She said you were an eminent artist
and saw Mephisto several times.

603
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:52,064
"We need such actors", she said, and
she promised to speak to her friend.

604
01:00:52,169 --> 01:00:57,319
This morning she said: "No matter
what silly things Höfgen has done...

605
01:00:57,417 --> 01:01:01,094
...when it's an eminent actor,
people are tolerant".

606
01:01:01,194 --> 01:01:06,726
Her friend has promised that nothing
will happen to you if you return.

607
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:10,949
Hendrik, Berlin awaits you.
You have nothing to fear.

608
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:15,523
No one can replace you.
Those who rule our lives...

609
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:21,190
...know that the theater is a shelter
for me and people like me...

610
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,901
...in which we all feel safe
and have nothing to fear.

611
01:01:25,034 --> 01:01:28,995
It would be that for you, too.
Theater is a mission.

612
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,545
In true friendship,
yours, Angelika Siebert.

613
01:02:24,777 --> 01:02:25,705
Name?

614
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:27,689
- Hendrik Höfgen.
- Profession?

615
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:29,630
Actor.

616
01:02:29,737 --> 01:02:30,686
Where?

617
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,023
At the State Theater in Berlin.

618
01:02:42,986 --> 01:02:45,189
- Is something wrong?
- No, no.

619
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,360
Thank you.

620
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:51,746
Thank you.

621
01:02:56,394 --> 01:02:59,940
I don't know if you'll
feel at home again here.

622
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:06,432
The spirit is different from
that you were accustomed to.

623
01:03:08,106 --> 01:03:10,440
Cultural Bolshevism is over.

624
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:17,794
There will no longer be a chance to
appear in your friend's plays...

625
01:03:18,218 --> 01:03:23,782
...or those popular French farces.
We perform German art now.

626
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:30,496
Frankly, I saw no great reason
to recall you from abroad.

627
01:03:31,273 --> 01:03:38,497
But Lotte Lindenthal wants you as
her partner in her comedy début here.

628
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:41,951
I didn't want to displease her.

629
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:50,469
The role of elegant friend and seducer
shouldn't cause you any difficulty.

630
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,602
I'm so cold.

631
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,454
I'll warm you up.

632
01:03:56,937 --> 01:04:00,166
Your room isn't heated
in this dreadful weather?

633
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:04,744
Is this how you anticipated my visit?
Very nice of you!

634
01:04:05,354 --> 01:04:08,037
There's a warm room over there.
Come.

635
01:04:08,138 --> 01:04:10,723
No, I'm in a great hurry today.

636
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:12,319
It would warm us up.

637
01:04:12,426 --> 01:04:14,913
No, there's no point in this cold flat.

638
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,864
My new maid doesn't
know her duties yet.

639
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:21,093
You should have told her
your visitor needed warmth.

640
01:04:21,193 --> 01:04:23,560
But I've only just returned home.

641
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:27,170
You should have returned earlier.

642
01:04:27,274 --> 01:04:30,372
I'm someone you must
wait for, impatiently.

643
01:04:30,474 --> 01:04:34,697
If I want to meet someone in passing,
I have my husband. And besides...

644
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:39,463
Where did you get this new maid?
She's far too pretty.

645
01:04:42,698 --> 01:04:44,770
It's an honor to act with you.

646
01:04:44,874 --> 01:04:48,518
It's so nice to hear
a warm voice again.

647
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:52,000
I'm happy to hear you say that,
I know you're no flatterer.

648
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:56,862
Me, a flatterer? I'm notorious
for telling people the truth.

649
01:04:56,969 --> 01:04:59,206
I like honest people.

650
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:16,133
If she turns, everything will be fine.
If she waves, I've scored a triumph.

651
01:05:17,577 --> 01:05:22,629
After the Reichstag fire,
I had to leave Hamburg.

652
01:05:22,729 --> 01:05:25,282
Bonetti wears a uniform now.

653
01:05:25,578 --> 01:05:28,360
He threw me out of the canteen.

654
01:05:28,553 --> 01:05:31,488
"We've got you now, Böck!" he said.

655
01:05:31,785 --> 01:05:35,746
They almost beat me up,
my landlady threw me out.

656
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,573
I had to leave Hamburg.

657
01:05:37,674 --> 01:05:39,813
Are you upset that I've come?

658
01:05:39,913 --> 01:05:44,735
When I heard you were in Berlin,
I found new hope...

659
01:05:44,842 --> 01:05:48,900
...and I just came.
Are you angry with me?

660
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:51,137
I'm not angry with you.

661
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:58,887
Live here till things settle down,
but don't tell anyone.

662
01:05:58,986 --> 01:06:02,433
Just simply disappear without a word.

663
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:08,808
If I were in your position,
I might well commit suicide.

664
01:06:09,802 --> 01:06:16,741
I'll buy you a radio, so you'll know
what's happening outside.

665
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:20,648
I've got nobody else
in the world but you.

666
01:06:20,745 --> 01:06:24,193
- Is Budapest beautiful?
- I don't know...

667
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:26,785
Yes, quite nice.

668
01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:29,864
I could have gone there.
Barbara wasn't with you.

669
01:06:29,962 --> 01:06:32,515
They wouldn't have let you
cross the border.

670
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:38,018
I'm a German citizen, too. My father
was pure German. Why can't I go out?

671
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:42,977
If you can't understand why,
we'll both be in trouble.

672
01:06:43,977 --> 01:06:47,174
- You're horrible.
- You're an idiot!

673
01:06:47,305 --> 01:06:50,436
Go to hell you... you actor!

674
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:20,711
Dear Lotte, may I ask a great favor?
I have to play Mephisto.

675
01:07:21,642 --> 01:07:23,235
I'll see what I can do.

676
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:27,458
I look forward to seeing
you again as Mephisto.

677
01:07:27,562 --> 01:07:32,297
It's thanks to me you're
playing Mephisto again.

678
01:07:32,554 --> 01:07:38,304
Certain ministerial circles feared
you might revive your old Faust spirit.

679
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:42,785
The spirit of cultural Bolshevism,
as it was called.

680
01:07:42,922 --> 01:07:47,657
Well, I succeeded in
overcoming those fears.

681
01:07:48,137 --> 01:07:51,617
Cäsar, thank you,
thank you very much.

682
01:07:55,754 --> 01:07:57,641
THANK YOU!

683
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,071
Please give these flowers...

684
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,628
...to Miss Lindenthal.

685
01:08:04,842 --> 01:08:07,176
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

686
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:10,559
Morning, Mr. Höfgen.

687
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:14,374
Mr. Miklas! Are you still around?

688
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:16,710
- Morning.
- Fine.

689
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:26,785
I've only been here a short space,
I come with a humility to this place...

690
01:08:27,657 --> 01:08:33,025
...to find a teacher of vocation
who's held by all in veneration.

691
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:36,675
How pleasant is your courtesy!
A man like many more you see.

692
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:38,818
Have you looked around?

693
01:08:40,297 --> 01:08:41,890
Take me as your student.

694
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,896
I come with courage and my youth.

695
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:48,831
I want to study with all my heart.

696
01:08:48,937 --> 01:08:51,076
You've come to the right place.

697
01:08:51,178 --> 01:08:52,934
I feel like going home I fear.

698
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:56,382
In that great hall
I won't like it at all.

699
01:08:56,682 --> 01:09:00,424
You see no grass, you see no tree.

700
01:09:00,522 --> 01:09:06,238
And in the classes we are taught
I lose my hearing, sight and thought.

701
01:09:06,473 --> 01:09:08,361
It all depends on habit.

702
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:12,200
Seeing the breast, a child
might accept the gift unwillingly.

703
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:14,021
But soon it sucks in delight.

704
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:18,377
So will you, on wisdom's breast,
enjoy it daily with more zest.

705
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:22,079
Around her neck I'll
cling with pleasure...

706
01:09:22,185 --> 01:09:26,146
...but tell me how can I
find this treasure?

707
01:09:26,346 --> 01:09:30,568
When you continue on your way,
which faculty will make your day?

708
01:09:30,698 --> 01:09:32,640
Is this where the cut comes?

709
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:36,069
The art of medicine
is not hard, you know.

710
01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:38,624
You study the world, big and small.

711
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:42,112
And in the end you let them go
when God demands it.

712
01:09:42,218 --> 01:09:44,771
You'll try in vain to learn all science.

713
01:09:44,873 --> 01:09:47,808
Each man just learns what he can.

714
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:51,939
But he who grasps every chance
he is the worthy man.

715
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:57,191
You are still of pleasing build
with self-confidence at last instilled...

716
01:09:57,322 --> 01:10:00,704
...others will have confidence in you.

717
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,941
Especially learn
the women to enthrall.

718
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:07,587
Eternal moans, a thousand ills.

719
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:11,236
There's just one place to cure them.

720
01:10:11,337 --> 01:10:17,317
If you've honor to some degree
one may allow some shared intimacy.

721
01:10:17,642 --> 01:10:24,450
A title helps to make her certain
your art exceeds that of your peers.

722
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:28,776
And may grant you a glimpse of which
another schemes for many years.

723
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:31,743
Her pulse you must learn to feel.

724
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:36,072
And burning looks you
then must steal.

725
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:43,807
Her slender hips are then embraced
to see how tightly she is laced.

726
01:10:44,425 --> 01:10:47,938
That's what I could care for.

727
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:54,216
Gray, my friend is all theory.
And green the golden tree of life.

728
01:10:55,657 --> 01:10:57,119
That's the way.

729
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:22,594
I greet the learned gentleman!
You made me to sweat profusely.

730
01:11:22,698 --> 01:11:25,185
- What is your name?
- The question's odd...

731
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,843
...for someone who idle talk despises.

732
01:11:27,945 --> 01:11:31,775
Who, far removed from worldly show
seeks only academic prizes.

733
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:36,482
With you, one knows your game
generally by your very name.

734
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:40,993
It's evident, Sire
if one's called a liar.

735
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:42,590
Who are you?

736
01:11:42,697 --> 01:11:44,836
I'm a part of that force...

737
01:11:44,969 --> 01:11:48,515
...that always craves evil
and always creates good.

738
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:50,079
What is this riddle?

739
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:52,095
I'm the spirit who negates.

740
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:56,392
And rightly so, for all creation
is worthy of annihilation.

741
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:59,042
So it were better,
nothing were created.

742
01:11:59,146 --> 01:12:04,002
And so everything you've stated
is sin, destruction, devilment.

743
01:12:04,138 --> 01:12:06,527
Remains my actual element.

744
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:11,431
Good evening. The Prime Minister
invites you to his box.

745
01:12:13,257 --> 01:12:14,206
Yes.

746
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,167
It's all going like clockwork.

747
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:45,535
May I introduce you to
my distinguished colleague?

748
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,784
Ah, our Mephistoles.

749
01:13:01,865 --> 01:13:03,240
Congratulations.

750
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:08,486
That mask is perfect, it's evil itself.
It's sacred evil.

751
01:13:09,322 --> 01:13:14,886
Yet, your eyes are so kind,
your handshake so soft. It's strange...

752
01:13:15,594 --> 01:13:22,370
...it seems the secret of acting is
to portray strength, yet one is weak.

753
01:13:26,377 --> 01:13:31,974
I imagine you've prepared
for this role for a long time.

754
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:34,371
All my life, Prime Minister.

755
01:13:35,017 --> 01:13:39,839
That's the only way.
That is the secret of greatness.

756
01:14:13,546 --> 01:14:14,822
Break a leg.

757
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,281
Carry on the good work, Mephistoles.

758
01:14:30,826 --> 01:14:32,135
Höfgen residence.

759
01:14:32,778 --> 01:14:33,857
Lotte Lindenthal.

760
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:38,087
Höfgen.

761
01:14:38,186 --> 01:14:39,396
- Hendrik?
- Yes.

762
01:14:39,498 --> 01:14:42,564
Will you come to us
after tonight's performance?

763
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:44,933
There'll be just a few friends here.

764
01:14:45,033 --> 01:14:48,775
With pleasure. Thank you very much.

765
01:14:50,634 --> 01:14:57,257
Böck!
Just a few friends will be there.

766
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,992
Am I not an incredible villain?

767
01:15:05,353 --> 01:15:08,321
Why a villain?
You're just successful, Mr. Höfgen.

768
01:15:08,554 --> 01:15:13,409
To the renewal of German culture.
Long live the actors.

769
01:15:20,713 --> 01:15:24,772
Our theater has many elements that
have nothing to do with Germany.

770
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:29,346
We must set up a customs control
of the mind for culture smugglers...

771
01:15:30,121 --> 01:15:35,523
...to stop foreign elements poisoning
German literature and theater.

772
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:40,265
This can't be left entirely
to our frontier guards.

773
01:15:40,521 --> 01:15:44,482
Everyone must cooperate
in this control.

774
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:46,882
- Am I understood?
- Yes, General.

775
01:15:48,266 --> 01:15:50,437
There are many who
don't understand.

776
01:15:51,562 --> 01:15:54,311
Look at this painting, my Mephisto.

777
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:57,632
A masterpiece of
German romanticism.

778
01:15:59,913 --> 01:16:05,216
Where did I find it? At an art dealer
with an foreign accent.

779
01:16:05,321 --> 01:16:08,616
I had it restored. No, no...

780
01:16:09,577 --> 01:16:13,506
...the future of painting doesn't
belong to the Liebermanns.

781
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,133
Your Mephisto occupies my mind.

782
01:16:16,426 --> 01:16:20,485
You've brought him alive.
He's a hell of a guy.

783
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:24,264
Isn't there a little of him in all of us?

784
01:16:25,162 --> 01:16:29,766
I mean, isn't there a bit of Mephisto
in every German?

785
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:35,106
Wouldn't our enemies love it if we
had nothing but the soul of Faust?

786
01:16:35,241 --> 01:16:40,544
No, Mephisto is also
a German national hero.

787
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:43,137
It's just something we
mustn't tell people.

788
01:16:44,937 --> 01:16:46,628
I must go now.

789
01:16:46,826 --> 01:16:51,495
Come to my office at 10:30,
the day after tomorrow.

790
01:16:51,594 --> 01:16:55,238
Some foreign journalists
want to know many things.

791
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:59,810
Above all, what 'Germany' means
today, and the German culture.

792
01:16:59,914 --> 01:17:05,577
I'll tell them. You can elaborate on
what I say about theater, for example.

793
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:10,340
Painting, architecture, sculpture,
plenty to write about.

794
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:13,472
I want them to be
informed by experts.

795
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:21,184
Tell me, why do you have
such a limp handshake?

796
01:18:27,018 --> 01:18:32,484
So, we meet again. How time flies!
You were wonderful as Mephisto.

797
01:18:32,586 --> 01:18:36,547
Now you act him more forcefully.
But I liked the other one, too.

798
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:41,122
I sensed it in the seed of what
can now be unfolded to the full.

799
01:18:41,226 --> 01:18:44,641
I also liked you in the play
with Lotte Lindenthal.

800
01:18:44,745 --> 01:18:48,739
The ideal actress to portray
the ideal German woman.

801
01:18:48,841 --> 01:18:55,203
What are we doing here? Why is
he wasting his time with foreigners?

802
01:18:55,818 --> 01:19:02,277
He said they're interested in German
culture. They'll ask a few questions.

803
01:19:02,377 --> 01:19:04,996
- I see. You spoke to him?
- Yes.

804
01:19:05,097 --> 01:19:08,097
How are you?
Nice to meet you again.

805
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:11,976
The Prime Minister sent for me.
I hope this doesn't last too long.

806
01:19:12,073 --> 01:19:16,645
Always problems with the old statues.
Shall we tear them down or not?

807
01:19:16,746 --> 01:19:20,007
As if that were important
for our future.

808
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:22,728
I'd like to sculpt
a bust of you, Höfgen.

809
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:27,810
What sort of man are you? Your own
face differs amazingly from Mephisto.

810
01:19:27,914 --> 01:19:30,783
In private life, you look rather shy.

811
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:34,851
I'll do a bust of you,
but in clay or in bronze?

812
01:19:34,953 --> 01:19:38,117
- What is your face made of?
- Perhaps a mixture.

813
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:43,750
I very much enjoyed your Mephisto.
I only had eyes for you.

814
01:19:43,849 --> 01:19:45,954
I'm preparing an exhibition.

815
01:19:46,058 --> 01:19:50,564
The General wants a pre view.
Try to come. Here's my number.

816
01:19:51,529 --> 01:19:55,784
If you have time, give me a ring
and come to my studio.

817
01:19:55,946 --> 01:19:59,361
You can relax while I model you.
How strange your face is.

818
01:19:59,465 --> 01:20:02,182
A German face yet it
changes every moment.

819
01:20:02,282 --> 01:20:05,631
That's acting.
The rest is humility and hard work.

820
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:12,455
I've discovered your secret.
It's the surprise effect, right?

821
01:20:13,769 --> 01:20:15,525
The unexpected.

822
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:21,321
I've been watching the way you
appear on stage. Always different.

823
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,697
Sometimes quick, erratic.

824
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:29,347
Then slow, suddenly,
when the audience is lulled.

825
01:20:29,993 --> 01:20:32,776
But always surprising
and unpredictable.

826
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:37,704
Thus you create the feeling
of something original...

827
01:20:38,217 --> 01:20:42,276
...even if the spectator
knows your lines by heart.

828
01:20:42,761 --> 01:20:47,649
And your glib tongue, your deliberate
pa uses, your precise emphasis.

829
01:20:49,706 --> 01:20:51,560
I think I'm learning from you.

830
01:20:52,777 --> 01:20:55,941
It's important to be unpredictable.

831
01:20:56,042 --> 01:21:01,443
Spectators needn't know what
my next step is or where I'm going.

832
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:05,123
- They're not prepared, it's a shock.
- Exactly.

833
01:21:05,322 --> 01:21:10,144
Yet it was only a change of pace,
or a slightly longer pa use.

834
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,894
In the theater it's the others
who make the king a king.

835
01:21:13,993 --> 01:21:20,420
Building the role is all important;
pianissimo alternating with fortissimo.

836
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:24,864
Naturally, you need a
certain flair, artistic talent...

837
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:28,199
...and as I usually say,
a high degree of culture.

838
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,199
When I hear the word culture,
I reach for my revolver.

839
01:21:31,306 --> 01:21:37,318
Bourgeois nonsense! Bolsheviks
preach it to win over school teachers.

840
01:21:37,418 --> 01:21:39,752
To say nothing of artists.
Isn't that so?

841
01:21:40,906 --> 01:21:44,615
I wasn't untouched by
Bolshevik trends, either.

842
01:21:44,938 --> 01:21:48,800
And I must admit that for a while
I flirted with the left.

843
01:21:50,346 --> 01:21:54,404
Well, anyone can get
involved in some folly.

844
01:21:55,402 --> 01:21:58,718
Those were troubled times.
Let's have a drink.

845
01:22:06,985 --> 01:22:12,320
General, other deserving artists
committed the follies I did.

846
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:17,641
I don't forget those paying for sins for
which I've been generously pardoned.

847
01:22:18,346 --> 01:22:23,103
I'm pleading for a certain person,
for a friend.

848
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:28,129
I guarantee he's reformed.
I'm pleading for Otto Ulrichs.

849
01:22:29,929 --> 01:22:32,963
Otto Ulrichs? Who's he?

850
01:22:33,065 --> 01:22:36,065
He ran the communist cabaret,
'The Storm-Bird'.

851
01:22:37,673 --> 01:22:43,075
Well... he must be
a pretty bad fellow.

852
01:22:43,177 --> 01:22:45,446
No, he's not bad.

853
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:49,855
A bit rash, I admit.
A bit thoughtless, but not bad.

854
01:22:50,089 --> 01:22:54,846
If anything, he's too decent.
Once he gives his word, he keeps it.

855
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:14,786
I'm back at the State Theater.

856
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,363
The funny thing is,
I simply can't believe it.

857
01:23:20,713 --> 01:23:25,929
Just as I can't believe
I'm here with you by the window.

858
01:23:26,633 --> 01:23:29,448
I know it's reality, but I don't feel it.

859
01:23:52,426 --> 01:23:55,295
- Great.
- Magnificent, really.

860
01:23:55,402 --> 01:23:57,093
A German work of art.

861
01:23:57,193 --> 01:24:00,576
Not every German artist is
capable of such work.

862
01:24:01,418 --> 01:24:03,785
It is a courageous work.

863
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:12,482
Come, Mephisto.

864
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:16,192
You sign, too.

865
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:26,945
What did I prophesy?
The exhibition is a success.

866
01:24:45,226 --> 01:24:48,095
You rascal, so you make
secret visits here.

867
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:55,618
If I may add something personal,
it is a courageous work.

868
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:58,853
Courageous,
because it captures our time...

869
01:24:58,985 --> 01:25:04,004
...the beauty of strength
without bourgeois snobbery.

870
01:25:04,137 --> 01:25:06,723
Contrasting the degenerate taste...

871
01:25:07,081 --> 01:25:09,448
...of the loud-mouths of culture.

872
01:25:09,545 --> 01:25:16,168
We see muscles and clear-cut
features mankind wants to see.

873
01:25:16,298 --> 01:25:19,080
Strong and beautiful in his strength.

874
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:22,977
Warrior-like and victorious
in his struggle.

875
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:34,025
Hello Hendrik.
That was a wonderful speech.

876
01:25:35,305 --> 01:25:38,240
- You know each other?
- Very well.

877
01:25:38,761 --> 01:25:40,649
You're in Berlin? Since when?

878
01:25:40,746 --> 01:25:44,041
I'm here because
I want to dine with you.

879
01:25:44,138 --> 01:25:47,269
I haven't seen you for so long.

880
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:49,192
So where will we go?

881
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:53,928
Your choice. How's Hamburg?
Surviving without me?

882
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:58,179
I'm in Berlin to have dinner with you.
Hamburg is history.

883
01:25:58,282 --> 01:26:02,624
You're out of touch. Kroge's in
Switzerland. He just vanished.

884
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:06,342
Didn't even tell his girl. Simply went.

885
01:26:07,497 --> 01:26:09,155
Kroge is a traitor.

886
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,859
Why must you appear with them?

887
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:19,685
Because they asked me to.

888
01:26:19,785 --> 01:26:22,568
They ask others, too. You needn't go.

889
01:26:22,665 --> 01:26:29,092
You can't refuse, none of us can.
If anyone says they do, they're lying.

890
01:26:29,802 --> 01:26:33,511
Besides, the General's a nice chap
and he knows a lot about the theater.

891
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:36,293
He's not so closed minded
as most others.

892
01:26:36,393 --> 01:26:41,860
A well behaved boy who wants to
enjoy the rewards for good behavior.

893
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:45,027
- Yes, I like to be well behaved.
- Because you're afraid.

894
01:26:47,561 --> 01:26:50,561
- I like it.
- Then you should.

895
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:55,008
It will be difficult to stay with me
and maintain good behavior.

896
01:26:59,433 --> 01:27:01,921
Damned black woman, right?

897
01:27:02,281 --> 01:27:05,664
I can't help being different
from what's allowed here.

898
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:09,861
People can spit in my face
in the street.

899
01:27:09,961 --> 01:27:12,744
Only I can't do anything about it.

900
01:27:12,841 --> 01:27:17,119
My nose, my hair remain the same
even if I want something else.

901
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:21,666
Yet, I'm German, a German Negro.
German is my mother tongue.

902
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:24,900
What am I supposed to do?
Where should I go?

903
01:27:25,034 --> 01:27:28,547
I don't know. I don't even know
what will become of me.

904
01:27:29,418 --> 01:27:31,425
You think only of yourself.

905
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:35,074
And like an idiot,
I dreamt of us having a child.

906
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:36,518
That's all we need.

907
01:27:36,746 --> 01:27:42,943
Is the child to be to blame, for she
might ruin her father's career?

908
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,805
That's enough now!

909
01:27:45,513 --> 01:27:48,928
- That's enough of that now!
- Now it is enough?

910
01:27:49,226 --> 01:27:55,456
I can see why your wife
couldn't stand living with you.

911
01:27:57,674 --> 01:28:01,602
Here... I pinched a photo
of you once. Look at it!

912
01:28:02,218 --> 01:28:03,843
Do you recognize yourself?

913
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:05,800
I must speak to you.

914
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:08,933
To tell me what you've said
behind my back?

915
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,659
I don't know what you mean.

916
01:28:10,762 --> 01:28:14,275
Höfgen would bury his mother alive.
Didn't you say that?

917
01:28:14,377 --> 01:28:17,127
I won't dispute that I dislike you.

918
01:28:17,642 --> 01:28:20,642
- What do you want?
- I want you to sign this.

919
01:28:20,745 --> 01:28:22,982
My signature? What for?

920
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:26,723
You want a raise?
Or do you collect signatures...

921
01:28:26,826 --> 01:28:30,720
...because theater safety
regulations are a bit unsafe?

922
01:28:30,985 --> 01:28:37,630
From a moral standpoint much seems
unsafe. And I don't mean the theater.

923
01:28:39,402 --> 01:28:41,256
What do you protest against?

924
01:28:41,353 --> 01:28:44,702
Against a leadership that
disregards our rights.

925
01:28:46,026 --> 01:28:49,604
But you were in the Nazi party,
back when you were in Hamburg.

926
01:28:49,706 --> 01:28:51,232
I'm leaving the party.

927
01:28:53,065 --> 01:28:54,559
That's your business.

928
01:28:54,922 --> 01:28:59,144
I'd like to ask you to
read our protest and sign it.

929
01:29:00,713 --> 01:29:05,896
Regardless of my opinion, you are
today's leading German actor.

930
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:10,241
Let me say that
I won't even read this thing.

931
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:15,588
Be careful not to get yourself
and others into real trouble.

932
01:29:15,946 --> 01:29:17,953
Miklas, you can go to hell.

933
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:26,088
I won't let a dirty pig like you
provoke me.

934
01:29:43,178 --> 01:29:44,160
Dear God.

935
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:49,569
Congratulations, my dear Höfgen.

936
01:29:50,154 --> 01:29:54,529
You put it precisely.
Some elements must go to the devil.

937
01:29:54,634 --> 01:29:57,950
If you were a soldier,
I'd promote you. I'm very pleased.

938
01:29:59,338 --> 01:30:02,785
By the way, you needn't be afraid.

939
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:09,317
For the fun of it, I checked
your horoscope. It's excellent.

940
01:30:10,025 --> 01:30:12,840
- Best of luck, Höfgen.
- Thank you.

941
01:30:19,242 --> 01:30:20,518
Did something happen?

942
01:30:25,706 --> 01:30:27,015
Good morning.

943
01:30:49,385 --> 01:30:50,814
Get walking!

944
01:31:27,498 --> 01:31:33,161
The management regrets that Hans
Miklas has died in a car accident.

945
01:31:36,681 --> 01:31:38,470
How awful, such a young fellow.

946
01:31:40,842 --> 01:31:44,736
But, frankly, there was something
disquieting about him...

947
01:31:44,809 --> 01:31:46,370
...don't you think?

948
01:31:49,161 --> 01:31:50,917
Disquieting...

949
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:06,465
That was no car accident.

950
01:32:10,506 --> 01:32:13,572
He must have come to you, too,
with that protest.

951
01:32:13,673 --> 01:32:18,081
Are you insane?
How can you talk such nonsense?

952
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:21,926
Why shouldn't it have
been a car accident?

953
01:32:22,313 --> 01:32:25,925
The government would stage
a car accident...

954
01:32:26,026 --> 01:32:28,514
...all for some unknown actor?

955
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:32,323
We're not in some
tenth-rate melodrama.

956
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,512
People shouldn't cross
roads in heavy traffic.

957
01:32:43,977 --> 01:32:48,996
I've great plans for you. We're alone.
You can refuse and remain an actor.

958
01:32:49,737 --> 01:32:53,534
But then you can't do as much
for our cause as you could.

959
01:32:55,337 --> 01:32:58,981
Your speech was good.
I realized you're not only an actor.

960
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:05,984
You put the essence into words.
Write your own biography, Hendrik.

961
01:33:06,825 --> 01:33:11,528
Submit it to me, as soon as possible.
Höfgen...

962
01:33:12,329 --> 01:33:16,585
...you will manage the Prussian
State Theater. Your task is easy:

963
01:33:16,681 --> 01:33:22,246
A full house and a wildly
enthusiastic, audience for you.

964
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:23,937
Do you understand?

965
01:33:25,705 --> 01:33:30,942
No need to enlarge upon
those matters in Hamburg.

966
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:36,548
Nor need we mention
the Revolutionary Theater.

967
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:39,333
Just mention some of
your roles there.

968
01:33:45,354 --> 01:33:49,129
What did you really imagine
in Hamburg?

969
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:53,094
How could you have conceived...

970
01:33:54,282 --> 01:34:00,392
...promoting Russian Bolshevism?
You, a German. Incredible!

971
01:34:01,577 --> 01:34:04,294
- Where is your wife now?
- In Paris, I believe.

972
01:34:04,394 --> 01:34:08,736
No, she's in Amsterdam,
working against her Motherland.

973
01:34:08,842 --> 01:34:11,013
They're publishing a newspaper.

974
01:34:14,217 --> 01:34:16,519
You don't correspond with her?

975
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:20,035
We have no contact at all.

976
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:23,809
You'll get a divorce easily.
I'll see to that.

977
01:34:25,289 --> 01:34:27,973
German citizens
who have left Germany...

978
01:34:28,138 --> 01:34:32,360
...couldn't wipe us out, so they
signed their own death sentence.

979
01:34:32,586 --> 01:34:35,815
Where weakness perishes,
humanity becomes healthy.

980
01:34:35,945 --> 01:34:38,945
Politics, like theater, is a fight.

981
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:43,202
Just as every rebuild
is the start of a new war.

982
01:34:45,578 --> 01:34:47,912
But we're not talking about this now.

983
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:55,297
Hamburg...
"In a harbor town by the river..."

984
01:34:57,034 --> 01:35:01,703
Lots of foreigners, night clubs, bars.
I understand you perfectly.

985
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:08,199
But in the Reich's capital?
No offense, we're men, but...

986
01:35:08,362 --> 01:35:13,796
What's this Hamburg souvenir
doing here? Juliette Martens.

987
01:35:15,370 --> 01:35:17,312
Is she kept by you?

988
01:35:21,929 --> 01:35:25,377
You once, rightfully, said...

989
01:35:25,738 --> 01:35:29,185
...Professor Bruckner was
not a man of the future.

990
01:35:29,834 --> 01:35:33,379
And, even more rightly,
you parted from his daughter.

991
01:35:34,249 --> 01:35:38,275
If you have such a good instinct
for a healthy, clean attitude...

992
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:41,640
...what's this Negro-woman
doing in Berlin?

993
01:35:44,426 --> 01:35:45,767
Mephisto...

994
01:35:47,882 --> 01:35:52,933
...it defies racial purity.
Don't even keep her picture at home.

995
01:35:53,226 --> 01:35:54,174
General...

996
01:35:54,282 --> 01:35:56,070
Wait, I haven't finished.

997
01:35:57,482 --> 01:36:00,995
I hope you completely
understood me.

998
01:36:04,138 --> 01:36:05,545
- Yes.
- So?

999
01:36:06,922 --> 01:36:10,118
- She's not to come to any harm.
- Leave that to me.

1000
01:36:11,593 --> 01:36:14,692
I'd like to request, Prime Minister...

1001
01:36:14,794 --> 01:36:18,307
...that she'd be allowed
to leave Germany unharmed.

1002
01:36:18,409 --> 01:36:25,054
Agreed. She'll be taken to the frontier
and good-bye. That's what we'll do.

1003
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:30,727
And you'll hold a press conference,
giving information about the theater.

1004
01:36:30,889 --> 01:36:33,737
The repertoire, plans
and your performances.

1005
01:36:34,058 --> 01:36:39,393
In October there'll be a big cultural
e vent in our Paris embassy.

1006
01:36:39,498 --> 01:36:41,734
I'd like you to attend it.

1007
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:52,418
Böck. I bet they know about him, too.

1008
01:36:52,777 --> 01:36:57,000
Böck, Böck, my note-book.

1009
01:36:59,241 --> 01:37:00,648
Böck stays.

1010
01:37:03,273 --> 01:37:05,990
- Here it is.
- Give it to me.

1011
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:12,163
I have to call friends.
I urgently need a friend.

1012
01:37:12,714 --> 01:37:17,089
- Find me a friend.
- But you've so many friends.

1013
01:37:19,082 --> 01:37:20,227
Friends...

1014
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:36,232
Call Miss Nicoletta von Niebuhr.
Find the number and call her.

1015
01:37:45,065 --> 01:37:46,953
Shall I make coffee, or tea?

1016
01:37:47,081 --> 01:37:49,929
Shall I become manager? Yes or no?

1017
01:37:50,985 --> 01:37:54,466
Can I? May I? Must I?

1018
01:37:55,146 --> 01:37:58,462
Is it my duty?
Can I make myself useful?

1019
01:37:58,570 --> 01:38:02,246
I mean, can I help anyone?
And if so, should I?

1020
01:38:03,338 --> 01:38:06,851
Or shall I look at it as a new role?

1021
01:38:07,018 --> 01:38:09,025
Or shall I emigrate to America?

1022
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:12,261
I can earn as much in films
as Dora Martin.

1023
01:38:12,874 --> 01:38:16,670
If I accept such an office
of this government, then...

1024
01:38:20,106 --> 01:38:21,928
Do I want to, at all?

1025
01:38:23,657 --> 01:38:25,380
They need me.

1026
01:38:26,761 --> 01:38:28,867
I was about to emigrate...

1027
01:38:28,969 --> 01:38:33,312
...and the Prussian Minister
asks me to rescue his theater.

1028
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,265
Tomorrow morning I must
give him an answer.

1029
01:38:37,482 --> 01:38:41,988
Heaven evidently has
great plans for me.

1030
01:38:42,153 --> 01:38:43,495
Then you've won.

1031
01:38:45,897 --> 01:38:47,555
Would you help me?

1032
01:38:49,129 --> 01:38:51,333
I'd be proud of you.

1033
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:56,767
Yes, I'll help you Hendrik.

1034
01:39:10,826 --> 01:39:12,833
If only one could live forever.

1035
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:26,720
Here's your passport for France.
You have five minutes to pack.

1036
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:28,231
Yes, but why?

1037
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:30,501
We're waiting. Hurry up.

1038
01:39:41,065 --> 01:39:43,880
You needn't thank me for this raise.

1039
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:47,360
I made it a condition for
taking over this job.

1040
01:39:47,530 --> 01:39:49,253
Everything's covered with dust.

1041
01:39:49,802 --> 01:39:55,399
If you don't clean the dressing rooms
as well as all the others...

1042
01:39:55,977 --> 01:39:59,239
...you may have to look
for another job.

1043
01:39:59,594 --> 01:40:04,744
I hope we'll get along. If you have
any problems, come to me.

1044
01:40:04,842 --> 01:40:08,387
I would like to treat you all to coffee.

1045
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:14,340
Allow me to give you the money.
I'm sorry I can't come with you.

1046
01:40:14,506 --> 01:40:17,091
Joachim would like to speak to you.

1047
01:40:17,193 --> 01:40:18,403
Wait, Hannelore!

1048
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:20,902
Wait, Hannelore!

1049
01:40:26,026 --> 01:40:28,644
So, now he can enter.

1050
01:40:28,873 --> 01:40:35,365
Please consider decent roles for me.
You're not like the other managers.

1051
01:40:35,466 --> 01:40:38,400
You're an actor yourself.
You understand.

1052
01:40:39,466 --> 01:40:42,368
I must act as if he's
saying something important.

1053
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:48,165
When you talk to actors, you must put
them at ease. That goes for me, too.

1054
01:40:48,329 --> 01:40:54,756
No, I don't like Premières. All night
one has to wear a big, frozen smile.

1055
01:40:54,858 --> 01:40:57,127
I hate that.

1056
01:40:59,114 --> 01:41:03,369
You think it's a good costume?
I don't! I think it's terrible!

1057
01:41:04,201 --> 01:41:06,754
Good morning, Mr. Kappelmüller.
How are you?

1058
01:41:06,857 --> 01:41:08,864
- Good.
- How's the family?

1059
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:12,614
So your daughter graduated as
a hairdresser. Maybe we can use her.

1060
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:14,758
Good morning.

1061
01:41:16,681 --> 01:41:22,345
Haven't you noticed? New suit,
new shoes, new manager, no? Well.

1062
01:41:22,698 --> 01:41:27,749
...ex-Bolshevik Höfgen, manager of
the Prussian State Theater...

1063
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:32,356
...is letting his former comrade
appear in his production of Hamlet.

1064
01:41:37,993 --> 01:41:42,150
Hannelore! Was the cast list
for Hamlet posted yet?

1065
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,264
Not yet.

1066
01:41:43,978 --> 01:41:48,036
Good. Let's wait another two days.
Thank you.

1067
01:41:53,642 --> 01:41:56,609
I must offer them more
than old comrades.

1068
01:41:56,874 --> 01:42:01,827
You must cultivate connections.
That's the essence of the system.

1069
01:42:01,962 --> 01:42:06,239
Let me tell you, yesterday I went to
the Prussian State Theater...

1070
01:42:06,345 --> 01:42:11,135
...it was Faust and the name of some
white-faced clown was Mephisto.

1071
01:42:11,241 --> 01:42:15,944
What a joke! And Mephisto by some
man called Höfgen, it was terrible!

1072
01:42:16,041 --> 01:42:20,319
I'd rather go to the Bavarian
People's Theater. Goodbye then.

1073
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:23,683
Why am I doing all this?

1074
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:26,366
Because I enjoy it.

1075
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:31,689
I must enjoy amateur plays and use
actors that are blonde not talented.

1076
01:42:31,786 --> 01:42:33,990
Most are totally untalented.

1077
01:42:34,154 --> 01:42:38,431
A Frankfurt audience
applauded Marquis Posa's...

1078
01:42:38,538 --> 01:42:42,531
...'Give us freedom of thought'.
Performance stopped, play withdrawn.

1079
01:42:42,634 --> 01:42:47,173
In Munich, 'The Robbers', withdrawn.
Schiller, our national poet!

1080
01:42:47,273 --> 01:42:51,943
They want to produce plays by
German authors. But what authors?

1081
01:42:52,073 --> 01:42:57,790
Those who haven't emigrated
aren't allowed to write, or won't.

1082
01:42:58,858 --> 01:43:03,592
It's simply impossible to offer
theater worthy of the name.

1083
01:43:03,754 --> 01:43:10,726
Unless I dig up a couple of old farces.
All Rococo wigs and white faces.

1084
01:43:13,674 --> 01:43:20,035
The joke is that the regime now sees
Shakespeare as one of our own.

1085
01:43:20,138 --> 01:43:24,262
Let's do 'As You Like It',
'Where the Banished Return.'

1086
01:43:24,553 --> 01:43:28,383
Show the opponents of dictatorship
that the will for freedom still lives.

1087
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:32,101
I didn't hear that!
I can't possibly have heard that!

1088
01:43:38,857 --> 01:43:41,061
Am I not an incredible villain?

1089
01:43:42,793 --> 01:43:45,379
Isn't what I'm doing insane?

1090
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:54,400
"Fürst and Niklisch, both on
the staff of your theater...

1091
01:43:54,698 --> 01:43:59,487
...on grounds of German
racial purity... dismiss them."

1092
01:44:00,554 --> 01:44:02,463
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1093
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:06,945
- Well, how are you?
- Fine.

1094
01:44:09,706 --> 01:44:13,535
- And you?
- Everything all right.

1095
01:44:13,898 --> 01:44:17,510
The stage-hands that are concerned,
Fürst and Niklisch...

1096
01:44:18,346 --> 01:44:20,582
...are indispensable...

1097
01:44:23,242 --> 01:44:26,690
...and the loss of their services...

1098
01:44:27,274 --> 01:44:32,194
...would jeopardize the theater's
work. Date. Heil! Signature.

1099
01:44:37,161 --> 01:44:40,129
Germans!
Don't tolerate Nazi oppression.

1100
01:45:50,698 --> 01:45:52,803
Embassy of the German Reich

1101
01:46:15,945 --> 01:46:19,775
Did you bring me anything from
Germany? A leather coat, at least?

1102
01:46:20,266 --> 01:46:21,640
- Leather coat?
- Yes.

1103
01:46:21,737 --> 01:46:27,618
It's the fashion for men. Those who
took me to the frontier had them.

1104
01:46:32,778 --> 01:46:36,738
Your eyes are so dead,
how do they look?

1105
01:46:37,321 --> 01:46:40,005
- Empty?
- No, dazed.

1106
01:46:40,106 --> 01:46:42,495
Yes, that's how I felt these past days.

1107
01:46:42,602 --> 01:46:45,188
You see? You were never like that.

1108
01:46:46,665 --> 01:46:50,626
I've thought a lot about you.
I believe I should be grateful.

1109
01:46:51,274 --> 01:46:55,103
Without you, I'd be in a
concentration camp, or already dead.

1110
01:46:56,969 --> 01:47:01,028
If you still like being with me,
then stay here.

1111
01:47:01,257 --> 01:47:04,770
I'll look after you. You needn't
leave the house, not at first.

1112
01:47:04,874 --> 01:47:07,743
Then we'll find jobs. You're so gifted.

1113
01:47:08,489 --> 01:47:11,457
- I could have gone to America.
- There you go.

1114
01:47:12,042 --> 01:47:15,009
I think I really was gifted.

1115
01:47:15,242 --> 01:47:17,151
But also a terrible coward.

1116
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:22,113
What do I do elsewhere? Be an extra,
a stage-hand, a technician?

1117
01:47:23,433 --> 01:47:27,143
Do you think these hands
were made for manual labor?

1118
01:47:27,498 --> 01:47:30,367
I'll provide for you.
What else do you want?

1119
01:47:31,369 --> 01:47:32,514
Success.

1120
01:47:32,618 --> 01:47:36,774
Hendrik Höfgen, just imagine...
you'd belong to me.

1121
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:42,373
Juliette, I have to go now.

1122
01:47:44,457 --> 01:47:47,425
- Shall I see you again?
- I don't know.

1123
01:47:47,530 --> 01:47:52,581
- Can I see you off at the station?
- No, you don't fit into the picture.

1124
01:47:55,433 --> 01:47:58,946
All right, forget the station.
Just do what you want.

1125
01:47:59,594 --> 01:48:01,001
I do.

1126
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:04,319
That's why I'm here.

1127
01:48:07,082 --> 01:48:11,010
Juliette, don't write anymore.
It's no good.

1128
01:48:53,354 --> 01:48:55,688
There aren't many people in this café.

1129
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:01,345
Would you prefer to sit in the sun?
You like that.

1130
01:49:01,450 --> 01:49:04,930
No. Though I haven't had
much sunshine lately.

1131
01:49:08,106 --> 01:49:11,455
May I ask you something?
Do you still live alone?

1132
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,498
No, I've got friends. And you?

1133
01:49:15,209 --> 01:49:19,071
Friends... in times like these?
It's difficult.

1134
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:24,454
How can you still live in Berlin?
What keeps you there?

1135
01:49:24,553 --> 01:49:26,855
Barbara, I live in the theater.

1136
01:49:27,017 --> 01:49:28,806
And that is in Berlin?

1137
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:32,614
I don't think you can judge
from Paris.

1138
01:49:36,394 --> 01:49:40,769
You're more than an actor now.
You took an oath. You're a manager.

1139
01:49:41,002 --> 01:49:43,849
I didn't take the oath,
I just moved my lips.

1140
01:49:43,945 --> 01:49:47,207
Someone has to save our
values for a better world.

1141
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:53,088
I'm playing Hamlet, whether those
in power like Shakespeare or not.

1142
01:49:53,418 --> 01:49:59,615
Shakespeare is their ornament to
prove "we're not as bad as you think".

1143
01:49:59,721 --> 01:50:01,380
You can't stay in Berlin.

1144
01:50:01,514 --> 01:50:05,889
I have a family in Berlin.
You know I'm married to the theater.

1145
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:08,999
I can help people who are
having a hard time.

1146
01:50:09,098 --> 01:50:12,327
If I leave, nothing better
will replace me.

1147
01:50:12,874 --> 01:50:13,888
Words!

1148
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:17,029
It's always the same with you.

1149
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:20,294
Your method of self-deception
is still intact.

1150
01:50:21,066 --> 01:50:26,761
Don't you see? Whoever you save,
it's only a gesture to your friends.

1151
01:50:27,082 --> 01:50:31,424
You're in a show-case, legalizing
these people will be attached to you.

1152
01:50:31,561 --> 01:50:35,173
We can't choose when
and where we're born.

1153
01:50:35,466 --> 01:50:37,375
An entire people can't emigrate.

1154
01:50:37,482 --> 01:50:42,500
As an actor I'm obliged to live in
my country, to observe and portray it.

1155
01:50:42,602 --> 01:50:46,628
And I can tell you, there are
decent people among them.

1156
01:50:46,986 --> 01:50:53,761
I hate coffee shop intellectuals and
I hate such resistance-fighters, too.

1157
01:50:53,866 --> 01:50:59,529
The really valuable, such as theater
and art can rise above everything.

1158
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:01,506
That's my conviction.

1159
01:51:01,673 --> 01:51:04,008
Why did you want to meet me?

1160
01:51:04,553 --> 01:51:07,936
Well, I don't really know why.

1161
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:13,951
It might even be dangerous for you.

1162
01:51:17,385 --> 01:51:20,768
Tell me, Barbara, did you ever...

1163
01:51:22,281 --> 01:51:23,808
...really love me?

1164
01:51:26,665 --> 01:51:32,743
Why did I come here today? If you'd
been listening, you wouldn't ask that.

1165
01:51:34,378 --> 01:51:37,760
If you don't accept what's
happening in Germany...

1166
01:51:37,866 --> 01:51:39,721
...why do you still live there?

1167
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:42,184
What does freedom mean for you?

1168
01:51:42,441 --> 01:51:46,751
Do you need it to live? Or do you just
need to be successful and loved?

1169
01:51:47,018 --> 01:51:50,214
I'm satisfied with success.
It means many love me.

1170
01:51:50,313 --> 01:51:52,997
And the fury of the envious
does me good.

1171
01:51:53,418 --> 01:51:57,825
Don't make me responsible
for the impotence of your friends.

1172
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:00,864
- Mr. Höfgen.
- Mr. Davidson, this is a surprise.

1173
01:52:15,689 --> 01:52:18,210
The check, please.

1174
01:52:19,306 --> 01:52:20,800
Have I come too early?

1175
01:52:21,961 --> 01:52:23,271
Farewell, Barbara.

1176
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:27,239
May I pa y?

1177
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:46,628
What could I do here?

1178
01:52:58,602 --> 01:52:59,911
Freedom...

1179
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:02,595
What for?

1180
01:54:20,489 --> 01:54:22,016
Oberon and Titania.

1181
01:54:27,401 --> 01:54:28,808
Congratulations!

1182
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:36,578
I greet our wonderful and truly
tantalizing German bride and groom.

1183
01:54:36,682 --> 01:54:40,130
Two young, yet mature people...

1184
01:54:40,233 --> 01:54:44,510
...of purest race and noblest blood,
who have enchanted us...

1185
01:54:44,618 --> 01:54:49,320
...and who serve our new society!

1186
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:58,471
- Thank you.
- All the best.

1187
01:55:05,642 --> 01:55:08,325
General, nice of you to come.

1188
01:55:08,745 --> 01:55:12,902
They can say what they want.
For me, the world is Grunewald.

1189
01:55:17,002 --> 01:55:22,119
I'll remain a German artist and patriot,
no matter who may rule my land.

1190
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:25,697
Grunewald is my favorite place...

1191
01:55:25,802 --> 01:55:28,901
...and what other country
brews such good beer?

1192
01:55:29,001 --> 01:55:31,489
Cäsar, nice to see you.

1193
01:55:34,153 --> 01:55:38,910
You can hold your rehearsals
in this villa.

1194
01:55:40,425 --> 01:55:44,801
We're very proud of the way
you spoke in Paris.

1195
01:55:44,905 --> 01:55:49,990
The way you simply answered
all the questions...

1196
01:55:50,569 --> 01:55:55,108
...and said quite frankly and
honestly what it's like here.

1197
01:57:03,306 --> 01:57:05,161
Carry on dancing.

1198
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:07,712
Good evening.

1199
01:57:09,578 --> 01:57:13,473
Now, that's a surprise!
I won't say no to that.

1200
01:57:24,297 --> 01:57:27,232
- Congratulations, my Mephisto.
- Thank you.

1201
01:57:27,337 --> 01:57:32,705
Now, as old Admiral Tirpitz said:
"Target sighted! Full speed ahead!"

1202
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:35,876
I'm looking forward to
your Hamlet, my Mephisto.

1203
01:57:37,193 --> 01:57:41,950
Your interview in Paris made a
good impression on all of us.

1204
01:57:44,201 --> 01:57:48,391
Congratulations!
And lots of healthy German boys!

1205
01:57:48,745 --> 01:57:49,694
Thank you.

1206
01:57:53,097 --> 01:57:54,079
Madam?

1207
01:57:58,474 --> 01:57:59,521
Beautiful.

1208
01:58:05,898 --> 01:58:09,575
Yes, very much to my taste.

1209
01:58:22,986 --> 01:58:24,327
Very lovely.

1210
01:58:26,793 --> 01:58:28,200
Thank you, Madam.

1211
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:32,352
Cheers!

1212
01:58:35,626 --> 01:58:38,015
We have no working hours, just work.

1213
01:58:38,954 --> 01:58:40,863
I'm sorry, I must go now.

1214
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:49,217
Be happy together... Hamlet.

1215
02:00:50,666 --> 02:00:56,165
Lately I've been wondering whether
we actually deserve all this.

1216
02:00:56,873 --> 02:01:00,452
If I'm forced to answer,
then I must say "Yes."

1217
02:01:00,553 --> 02:01:04,809
If not we, who represent
individuality and art...

1218
02:01:05,353 --> 02:01:10,143
...who else should, can and must rise
above all that happens in the world?

1219
02:01:10,249 --> 02:01:14,406
That's why we're an example
and encouragement to others.

1220
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:17,155
No matter how filthy the world is...

1221
02:01:17,258 --> 02:01:22,408
...true art always remains pure
and true, doesn't it?

1222
02:01:22,506 --> 02:01:24,644
I'm married to the theater.

1223
02:01:25,673 --> 02:01:26,786
And so are you.

1224
02:01:27,754 --> 02:01:32,991
I can't contact Otto Ulrichs.
I sent a messenger to his flat...

1225
02:01:33,097 --> 02:01:39,688
...but he was told that two men
took Ulrichs away two days ago.

1226
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:56,320
Call the Prime Minister and
connect me with him.

1227
02:01:57,801 --> 02:02:02,057
If he's not there, ask for an
appointment as soon as possible.

1228
02:02:04,265 --> 02:02:05,826
- Hello?
- Give it to me.

1229
02:02:07,305 --> 02:02:08,418
Höfgen.

1230
02:02:09,865 --> 02:02:13,727
- Hello.
- Do come in.

1231
02:02:25,289 --> 02:02:27,678
- Hello.
- Do come in.

1232
02:02:33,546 --> 02:02:35,433
Well, what's going on?

1233
02:02:36,522 --> 02:02:39,904
Recently you helped me, on
behalf of a colleague.

1234
02:02:41,578 --> 02:02:43,618
Now I have to ask again for help.

1235
02:02:45,097 --> 02:02:46,341
The thing is...

1236
02:02:47,434 --> 02:02:54,242
...a few days ago, Otto Ulrichs
was taken from his apartment.

1237
02:02:55,818 --> 02:02:59,233
- Is this why you've come?
- Yes, Excellency.

1238
02:02:59,593 --> 02:03:04,863
I'm fed up with you, Höfgen. These
matters are outside your jurisdiction.

1239
02:03:05,449 --> 02:03:08,166
Keep your nose out of this affair.

1240
02:03:08,618 --> 02:03:11,684
I'll give you some good advice:
Stop meddling.

1241
02:03:11,786 --> 02:03:14,982
You'd do better minding
your own business...

1242
02:03:15,082 --> 02:03:19,784
...so you won't get crushed
like a bug! Think you matter?

1243
02:03:21,002 --> 02:03:22,977
Ulrichs was involved in dirty work.

1244
02:03:23,081 --> 02:03:27,554
My State Theater manager ought
not show such interest in a traitor.

1245
02:03:28,137 --> 02:03:29,119
Now go.

1246
02:03:29,609 --> 02:03:30,984
I told you to go.

1247
02:03:31,914 --> 02:03:33,954
Get out, actor!

1248
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:21,027
I know how much I and the theater
owe to the General.

1249
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:24,742
I also know that to a great
extent we owe it to you.

1250
02:04:24,906 --> 02:04:29,161
Dear Lotte, that's why I ask you
to intervene for Ulrichs.

1251
02:04:29,258 --> 02:04:33,382
- I'm so worried.
- Worried? But he's dead.

1252
02:04:33,865 --> 02:04:38,208
Didn't you know? As far as I know,
he committed suicide.

1253
02:04:41,161 --> 02:04:42,339
Suicide.

1254
02:04:45,097 --> 02:04:48,959
He knew the risks he ran.
I think he's more to be envied.

1255
02:05:29,642 --> 02:05:34,912
The Prince of Denmark
renounces rank, youth and love.

1256
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:37,090
He is the savior of the North.

1257
02:05:37,193 --> 02:05:42,910
The lonely knight with lofty ideals,
the ideal of purity of blood and race.

1258
02:05:43,018 --> 02:05:47,360
Hamlet is a complex character, too.
A great and simple man.

1259
02:05:47,466 --> 02:05:52,037
Despite repeating myself so soon:
He is a man of the North.

1260
02:05:52,233 --> 02:05:57,448
He kills. And in his
self-destructing battle...

1261
02:05:58,921 --> 02:06:00,896
...he shows us the way to the future.

1262
02:06:01,002 --> 02:06:05,377
He commands us to lead a pure life.
That is his bequest to us today.

1263
02:06:05,481 --> 02:06:10,533
He is not weak, yet actors have
often portrayed him as neurotic...

1264
02:06:10,633 --> 02:06:15,455
...a pathological revolutionary,
thus as a decadent type.

1265
02:06:15,562 --> 02:06:17,766
Hamlet is a hard man.

1266
02:06:17,865 --> 02:06:23,397
You will see him as an
energetic, resolute hero.

1267
02:06:23,594 --> 02:06:29,377
He is also a hazard for the Germans.
We constantly analyze too much.

1268
02:06:29,481 --> 02:06:32,449
For the hour demands actions,
not only thoughts.

1269
02:06:32,553 --> 02:06:34,887
Least of all corruptive reflection.

1270
02:06:35,306 --> 02:06:40,423
Hamlet is the tragic conflict
between action and inaction.

1271
02:06:40,618 --> 02:06:44,447
Between hesitating,
thinking and doing.

1272
02:06:45,289 --> 02:06:49,315
And we, the bearers
of German culture...

1273
02:06:49,514 --> 02:06:51,881
...know what to make of that.

1274
02:06:52,202 --> 02:06:54,341
Hamlet is a populist drama.

1275
02:06:54,441 --> 02:06:58,086
Neither religious,
aristocratic, nor bourgeois...

1276
02:06:58,185 --> 02:07:00,487
...but a work like the Greek tragedies.

1277
02:07:00,586 --> 02:07:05,321
So we'll abolish the barrier
between audience and actor.

1278
02:07:05,801 --> 02:07:09,696
Space, light, movements,
sounds are everything...

1279
02:07:09,801 --> 02:07:14,504
...and even the spectators merge
into one great, common effect.

1280
02:07:14,857 --> 02:07:17,476
We must bring about total theater.

1281
02:07:17,866 --> 02:07:21,925
A theater that shocks and mobilizes.

1282
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:31,198
It cost 60,000 marks to decorate
the theater for tonight...

1283
02:08:31,305 --> 02:08:34,088
...and five days loss of takings.

1284
02:08:34,185 --> 02:08:38,114
A nice birthday party. And we have
to participate in this circus.

1285
02:08:38,217 --> 02:08:40,127
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1286
02:09:26,794 --> 02:09:30,143
The only place you will find a
party like this is in Berlin.

1287
02:09:48,201 --> 02:09:51,300
Dearest Bella,
we haven't met in ages.

1288
02:09:51,402 --> 02:09:53,889
Are you well? Not homesick?

1289
02:09:53,994 --> 02:09:58,882
I'm sure you're fantastically well
and your great son is flourishing.

1290
02:10:07,945 --> 02:10:11,109
Dear Höfgen, how are you?
How is the party going?

1291
02:10:11,337 --> 02:10:12,963
People seem to enjoy it.

1292
02:10:13,065 --> 02:10:17,375
Your Hamlet was magnificent.
The boss was quite taken.

1293
02:10:17,482 --> 02:10:24,771
After the première he spoke
only of you and the theater.

1294
02:10:24,906 --> 02:10:28,353
Success is strange. Sometimes
you have it, sometimes not.

1295
02:10:28,457 --> 02:10:34,174
No, dear Höfgen, you give
people something, you create.

1296
02:10:36,522 --> 02:10:37,634
Here they come.

1297
02:12:04,873 --> 02:12:08,169
- How are you, Mephisto?
- Very well, Your Excellency.

1298
02:12:09,481 --> 02:12:12,743
I haven't told you, how wonderful
your Hamlet was.

1299
02:12:12,842 --> 02:12:15,657
I'm very glad.
Allow me to say a few words.

1300
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:22,341
Mr. Prime Minister, Madam,
ladies and gentlemen.

1301
02:12:23,113 --> 02:12:30,086
We are proud to be able to celebrate
this day with you in this theater.

1302
02:12:30,314 --> 02:12:31,972
Since I have the honor...

1303
02:12:32,105 --> 02:12:34,855
...of greeting you on behalf
of everyone present...

1304
02:12:34,954 --> 02:12:38,914
...I salute the statesman and soldier...

1305
02:12:39,017 --> 02:12:42,366
...friend and generous
patron of the arts.

1306
02:12:43,690 --> 02:12:47,137
We admire him as our role model,
love him as our friend...

1307
02:12:47,273 --> 02:12:48,899
...obey him as our master...

1308
02:12:49,033 --> 02:12:53,027
...for without patrons,
art is a bird with broken wings.

1309
02:12:53,258 --> 02:12:56,836
As the poet says:
"May the gods protect you...

1310
02:12:56,938 --> 02:12:59,905
...and may the heart of Rome
beat for your aims".

1311
02:13:07,465 --> 02:13:12,516
The Prime Minister wishes to
speak to you outside, in his car.

1312
02:13:13,066 --> 02:13:14,276
You alone.

1313
02:13:18,089 --> 02:13:20,904
Nicoletta will take you home.
I won't be long.

1314
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:18,690
Well, Mephisto, what power is
looking down on you here.

1315
02:14:19,081 --> 02:14:20,740
Do you feel it?

1316
02:14:21,545 --> 02:14:27,110
This is theater! Look at this arena.
It's almost ready. Wonderful, isn't it?

1317
02:14:27,850 --> 02:14:30,403
This is where
I'd stage a performance.

1318
02:14:31,241 --> 02:14:35,267
Don't blink, Hendrik, look history
in the eye. What an echo.

1319
02:14:37,738 --> 02:14:40,007
Hendrik Höfgen!

1320
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:47,683
We shall rule Europe and the world.
A thousand-year empire.

1321
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:50,693
Hendrik Höfgen!

1322
02:14:59,433 --> 02:15:01,888
Go! Get going!

1323
02:15:05,513 --> 02:15:06,659
Into the middle!

1324
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:26,981
Well, how do you
enjoy this limelight?

1325
02:15:28,426 --> 02:15:30,498
This is the real light, isn't it?

1326
02:16:03,434 --> 02:16:06,500
What do they want of me? After all...

1327
02:16:07,274 --> 02:16:09,346
...I'm only an actor.
