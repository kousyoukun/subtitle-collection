1
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,087
- What happened Mr. Höf gen?
- What do you want?

2
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,597
l don't need you now!
Go to hell!

3
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:48,312
We'r e invited to a boring banquet.
Sorry, but we have to leave now.

4
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:51,149
Can't you sit with us, Dora?

5
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,688
No, we'r e much too late.

6
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:55,656
Sorry, good evening.

7
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,557
l wanted to say you wer e
marvelous tonight.

8
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:01,826
lt was fantastic. Thank God l saw it.

9
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:07,495
Y ou fraud, you didn't see the show.
Never mind, you'r e talented.

10
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:10,038
Me? Talented? Say it louder.

11
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:14,441
Y es, you'r e very talented,
Herr Höf gen.

12
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:19,282
l'm sur e you'll soon be able to show
just how talented you ar e.

13
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,779
l must be going, goodbye.

14
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:36,988
- Böck. Seven marks.
- But Hendrik...

15
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,533
... if you need money
l can lend you fifty marks.

16
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:44,569
This is men's business.
Böck likes giving money.

17
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,702
Good evening, Miklas.
Thank you.

18
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:51,101
So...

19
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,241
... Doctor Kr oge lets me starve.

20
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,321
Höf gen, you old sinner!
Take a seat.

21
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:04,688
Well, Dir ector,
how'd you like the show?

22
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,162
What's getting you down, Hendrik?

23
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,795
That l'm a pr ovincial actor.

24
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,330
ls that all? Nothing else?

25
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:47,092
Hello.

26
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:51,528
Y ou'r e late.

27
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:56,738
One day, l'll come to fetch you.

28
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,133
Don't you dr ead that, Heinz?

29
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:02,941
- Please don't call me Heinz.
- Why not? That's your name.

30
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,876
l dislike it. Understand?

31
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:09,418
Perfectly, Heinz.

32
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:14,457
Y ou can't even drink a beer like
a man who feels like drinking one.

33
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,548
Shall we start?

34
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,821
What was that about beer?

35
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:22,892
lt's not your style,
simply to call for a beer.

36
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,334
''A beer, please'' sounds
phony when you say it.

37
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,503
l don't drink, Juliette.

38
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:32,698
l know, Heinz. Take your shoes off.

39
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,826
Come on...

40
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:58,392
One, two...

41
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:43,433
One, two...

42
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,167
...one, two, thr ee, four...

43
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,473
On one...

44
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,045
Don't fall down now.

45
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,584
Faster!

46
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,952
Faster!
Show me what you can do.

47
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:42,555
Y ou want to be an actor
and show off for money, too?

48
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,270
Y ou comical pictur e of misery.

49
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,115
lf you liked this music,
you wouldn't get tir ed.

50
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,749
Y ou always laugh at me, Juliette.

51
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:17,597
l can't cry. Would you
love me if l could cry?

52
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,532
l love you anyway.

53
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:24,538
Y ou only love yourself, Heinz,
and even then not enough.

54
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:28,741
Keep talking.
What you say is very nice.

55
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:34,714
Y our only concern is your face
being devoid of human expr ession.

56
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,444
lt's a mask, you hear?

57
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:43,388
l, too, have skin and bones
and body weight...

58
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:46,824
...and eyebr ows and fingernails,
just like you.

59
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:54,599
l, too, feel the cold.
l can be hungry and thirsty.

60
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,465
l, too, think of my mother.

61
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,233
And l know ther e ar e
Philistines and Communists.

62
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,638
But my eyes ar e not my eyes.

63
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:11,576
My legs ar e not mine,
my face is not mine.

64
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:16,950
My name is not my name,
because l am an actor!

65
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:21,554
Do you know what it
means to be an actor?

66
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:26,364
An actor is a mask...

67
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,191
...among human beings.

68
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:45,609
Juliette...

69
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:49,115
Juliette...

70
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,497
Ladies and gentlemen,
l have the honor...

71
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:48,269
...of welcoming you to the
first r eading of the play.

72
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:54,544
May l intr oduce our guest,
Nicoletta von Niebuhr...

73
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:58,675
...who will play the female
lead in this pr oduction.

74
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,020
Do you mind if my friend
watches the r ehearsal?

75
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:10,761
l have no objection.

76
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:16,700
- Two cognacs, please.
- Y es, dir ector.

77
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,173
Coming up right away.

78
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:21,864
Thr ee beers, please.

79
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,399
Ther e you go.

80
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,172
Please ex cuse me.

81
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,109
Please ex cuse me.

82
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,019
Father Hansemann...

83
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:39,648
Hendrik, will we look
lovely in this play?

84
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:40,850
We ar e lovely.

85
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,521
May l intr oduce my best friend,
Barbara Bruckner?

86
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,961
Nice to meet you.

87
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:47,387
What?

88
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,161
Ther e's a nice smell of
lavender about you.

89
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,860
Can you smell the lavender, too?

90
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:57,769
How shocking, on a man.
But l need it like my daily br ead.

91
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,141
A little on the temples is
as good as a night's sleep.

92
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:05,113
Sleep would be better,
but ther e's no time.

93
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,884
A beer and a mineral water.

94
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,611
We'll hear what he has to say...

95
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:15,658
... use the good bits,
then play it our way.

96
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:18,657
He's good, but old-fashioned.

97
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:21,732
The futur e of Hamburg
Art Theater is me.

98
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,800
l mean the two of us.

99
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:31,505
Most of the plays her e
ar e shallow bourgeois stuff.

100
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:35,809
But we visualize theater
that will involve everyone...

101
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,210
...the workers, the dockers.

102
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:40,873
Wher e will you perform this theater?

103
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,711
lt doesn't matter.
ln the docks, factories, cellars.

104
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:48,256
They asked me about the play.
We pr omised it for last week.

105
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:51,292
Let's get this opening night over first.

106
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,188
We must pr ove that theater
has a political function.

107
00:14:56,332 --> 00:15:01,565
Befor e it can be political or
r evolutionary, it first has to be good.

108
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,194
Which actors will be in
this sort of theater?

109
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,502
All who think like us. Even workers.

110
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,772
lt's what we say, not how we say it.

111
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:14,871
But l've no qualms if
Hendrik stages our plays.

112
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,014
Go on. Why ar e you looking at me?

113
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,388
Am l not allowed to?

114
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:24,151
lf it pleases you, go ahead.

115
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,011
Without you, l'll be finished, Barbara.

116
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,752
Ther e's too much evil in me.

117
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:34,615
Alone, l'm too weak to overcome it,
but you could help me.

118
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:42,893
l can't talk anymor e. So many
thoughts ar e just parts l've played.

119
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,000
l love you, Barbara.

120
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:15,129
l'm in love. With a woman.

121
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:20,166
Juliette, am l a good looking man?

122
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:24,667
l've never seen you on stage.
Maybe you'r e handsome, but...

123
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:29,004
...frankly, l've never found
you good looking, but...

124
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:34,444
...sometimes your cold cheating eyes
ar e those of a sad child.

125
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,380
Y ou do it well.

126
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:41,448
Who have you fallen for?

127
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:44,347
- A girl.
- Gr eat.

128
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,822
Y ou falling in love...

129
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:50,555
One day you may just learn
how to walk, not just dance.

130
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:56,199
Love the girl, Heinz, and don't
tell me anything about her.

131
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:01,933
- Do we keep in touch?
- Y es.

132
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:06,073
Y ou know what? l'm coming with you.

133
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,837
l have nothing to lose, Heinz.

134
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,693
Ar e you crazy?

135
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,073
See a psychiatrist.

136
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:45,145
Though l'm sur e you wouldn't
dar e talk about yourself.

137
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:50,649
Go, Heinz. We'll meet soon anyway...

138
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,280
...even if l don't want to.

139
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:57,525
Grandmother, have you a moment?

140
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,860
- l'd like to intr oduce...
- Y our fiancé.

141
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:07,368
l have to take a closer look
at my new grandson.

142
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,473
Not bad at all.

143
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,674
Ex cuse my mother please,
she will be her e shortly.

144
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:25,213
l assume you know,
my dear Höf gen...

145
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:32,323
...that loving mothers rar ely want
their only sons to leave the nest.

146
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:38,330
Hello, Sebastian.

147
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:40,127
That is Sebastian.

148
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:48,969
Mom.

149
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,744
l'm r eally pleased.

150
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,914
Barbara, my dear child.

151
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,814
And l'm Nicoletta von Niebuhr...

152
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:07,452
...the bride's best friend,
almost her sister.

153
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:14,592
Often, the bridegr oom's mistr ess.
Only onstage, of course.

154
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:17,464
May l call you Aunt Bella?

155
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:19,936
But of course, Nicoletta.

156
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:29,607
Let us leave the ladies to themselves.

157
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:33,448
l'd like to show you my garden.

158
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:36,521
l'd love to see it.

159
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:42,579
Have you unsettling memories, too?

160
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:48,817
Y ou know, Barbara,
memories that give you the cr eeps?

161
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:56,458
When l was about twelve,
l got into our school choir.

162
00:21:56,598 --> 00:22:02,935
l was overjoyed. l thought l could
sing better than the other boys.

163
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,333
We had to sing in church
at some wedding.

164
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:16,007
l wanted to show off.
l was so pr oud of my soprano voice.

165
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,348
l had a gr eat idea. l sang
one octave higher than the others.

166
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:23,523
As l stood ther e, pr oudly singing...

167
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:29,586
...the music teacher looked at me
mor e in disgust than disappr oval...

168
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,631
...and he said softly,
''Just keep quiet.''

169
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,423
Do you understand?

170
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:39,165
Softly and dryly he said,
''Just keep quiet.''

171
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:42,673
When l felt l was singing
like an angel.

172
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:45,444
Do you have such memories?

173
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:48,603
No.

174
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:54,447
Y ou've never felt
ashamed in your life.

175
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,716
l often have. That was the first time.

176
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:02,819
l often have to feel awfully
ashamed of myself.

177
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:07,095
So ashamed,
l could sink down into hell.

178
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,061
Do you understand me?

179
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:16,704
This is the basement r oom.
The window faces the str eet.

180
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:21,973
Her e's a lamp post and her e, too.
Behind it the bakery...

181
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,946
- ...with workers' wives lined up.
- Stop!

182
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:27,909
Gr eat.

183
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,247
Ms. Schult, you come up
past the window.

184
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:35,655
Barbara, can you put a
lamp post her e...

185
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:39,489
...with a light to dazzle the audience?

186
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:45,192
Then you come her e. ''l'm Widow
Queck who hasn't paid the r ent.''

187
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:51,137
We could have several mor e
lamp posts in the auditorium...

188
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:56,177
...so people feel they'r e
r eally in their filthy str eet.

189
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:02,148
We'll have posters, r ecent political
slogans, all jumbled up.

190
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:08,254
At the back, a gr ocer's shop,
with nothing to sell, of course.

191
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:12,691
Everything in the hall must
expr ess what we talk about.

192
00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:18,163
Two policemen can patr ol the r ows
and star e at the audience.

193
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:23,704
An end to passive watching, actors
and public isolated fr om each other.

194
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:29,801
The public must play an active part.
The days of the peepshow ar e over.

195
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,438
The actor is only one element
of the performance...

196
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:35,482
... not it's focal point.

197
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:41,748
The hall, lights, walls, movements,
sounds, all must blend into a whole.

198
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:47,487
Only then shall we have r eal theater.
The workers need total theater.

199
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:51,121
One that shocks and ar ouses.

200
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:58,293
l am the widow Queck, who cannot
pay the r ent. l work for the baker.

201
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:01,838
lt's the only way l can feed
my seven hungry childr en.

202
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:04,876
The half-hour has to be paid for.

203
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:07,969
We've been waiting half an hour.

204
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,980
Her e r eigns logic and hunger.

205
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,078
l alr eady owe you 31 marks
and 25 pfennigs.

206
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:20,122
l've had nothing these past few days.

207
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,185
Silly goose !

208
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:27,221
Sabotaging our work!
Do you think l don't know why?

209
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:32,497
Miklas or one of his damn party
friends has put you up to it!

210
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:36,232
- What do you want fr om me?
- Why don't you pr ompt her?!

211
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:43,270
Never mind! Revolutionary Theatr e
can't be staged with pr ovincial hams.

212
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:47,009
With amateurs, you can't
cr eate any sort of theatr e.

213
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:50,553
Even r evolutions need pr ofessionals!

214
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:58,990
l'll buy you a drink to celebrate.
Revolutionary Theater is a big flop.

215
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:01,997
Y ou'r e beside yourself with joy.

216
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:08,227
Hello.

217
00:26:08,604 --> 00:26:10,538
Two stiff ones, Hansemann.

218
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:18,709
How about another
r ebellious evening?

219
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:24,550
l'd like to invite you to dinner.

220
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,446
What, me?

221
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,189
- Good morning.
- Morning.

222
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:34,089
Y ou'r e still half asleep.

223
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,992
l'm awake.

224
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:43,103
l've even phoned our gr ocer, he's
a bit impatient over our large bill.

225
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:48,741
l'm sorry. l don't pr esent a pictur e
of early morning fr eshness.

226
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:55,740
lf l, too, went riding every morning
l'd pr obably look mor e attractive.

227
00:26:56,417 --> 00:27:00,217
But in our circles,
such noble sport is not customary.

228
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:03,779
The offended husband, as in Moliér e.

229
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,653
Oh, be quiet.

230
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,657
lt's not customary to sit all night
at a Nazi thug's table.

231
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:16,825
- Miklas is not a thug.
- All Nazis ar e thugs.

232
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:22,974
Y ou must avoid their company.
Their dirt rubs off on you.

233
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:29,810
But you can't understand. lt's your
family's well known liberalism.

234
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:36,013
No political beliefs, just curiosity.
ldeologies ar e psychological quirks.

235
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,385
l feel sorry for Miklas. He gets
small parts and earns very little.

236
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:46,157
Y ou all tr eat him very badly. He's
at a loss, that's why he's with them.

237
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,295
So much understanding
for that lousy brat.

238
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,859
How do you think they'd tr eat us
if they came to power?

239
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,132
God forbid.

240
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,973
And yet you sit and chat with him.
lt's you bourgeois tolerance.

241
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,673
This understanding of one's enemy.

242
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:09,650
l'm sur e you could even
ex cuse Fascist terr orism.

243
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:13,884
Y our liberalism might even
get used to dictatorship.

244
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:15,618
No, thank you.

245
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,857
May l r emark...

246
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,420
... it's common practice to eat an egg
fr om its shell and with salt.

247
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:26,662
l know, in the Bruckner household
you eat it fr om a glass...

248
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,761
...with six spices,
and that's very original...

249
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:35,504
... but no need to make fun of those
unaccustomed to such originality.

250
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:53,721
- Who's juvenile lead in Halberstadt?
- Herbert Boltz.

251
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:56,193
Wher e's
Ms. Türkheim-Gawernitz now?

252
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,491
ln Heidelberg.

253
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,066
- And Hannelor e Kühn.
- Mannheim.

254
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:03,068
- And who's Othello ther e?
- Max Krause.

255
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:05,365
- And lago?
- Johannes Fiedler.

256
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:08,339
- And Desdemona in Leipzig?
- Kathe Müttel.

257
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,171
Who's the ingénue in Jena?

258
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:13,041
A stupid cow called Lotte Lindenthal.

259
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:17,440
Why is Lotte Lindenthal a stupid cow?

260
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:19,652
l don't know, but she is.

261
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:22,654
l know why you insult her.

262
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:26,317
She's the friend of
a National Socialist leader.

263
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:32,594
l'm only moderately inter ested
in the names and titles of her lovers.

264
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:36,431
Must be quite a long list...

265
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:38,299
Watch your tongue, Höf gen!

266
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:46,902
Y ou won't insult a lady because she's
in the Nazi German worker's party...

267
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,410
...and the friend of a German her o.

268
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,107
Y ou won't stand for it?

269
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,118
My, my...

270
00:29:57,723 --> 00:29:59,986
Stop it, you'r e drunk.

271
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,155
l'm not. On the contrary.

272
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:09,058
Appar ently l'm the only one her e
with a spark of honor left.

273
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:13,228
Nobody in this Jew-ridden business
car es if a lady is insulted.

274
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:16,270
Let me !

275
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,464
No !

276
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:22,809
Go away!

277
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:28,712
l'll gladly believe you'r e not drunk.

278
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:32,952
Y ou won't make that an ex cuse, then.

279
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:36,026
As for this Jew-ridden
business you'r e in...

280
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,492
...you won't suffer it much longer.

281
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:41,528
That l pr omise you.

282
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,662
Perhaps you'r e right.

283
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:49,028
l agr ee, the fellow's behavior
was intolerable...

284
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:53,336
... but l can't just fir e a poor,
sick man like that.

285
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,000
Sick? He's not sick at all.

286
00:30:56,246 --> 00:31:02,047
Why this indecision and compr omise?
lt's just like our government parties.

287
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,643
Ex cuse me, Barbara.

288
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:08,746
We must show this murder ous
pack it can't get away with it.

289
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:12,257
l beg you, don't insist that
he be sacked on the spot.

290
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:17,355
lt's punishment enough that he
won't be hir ed for next season.

291
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:21,696
He has no idea what he said
last night, he just went wild.

292
00:31:21,802 --> 00:31:23,394
l'm amazed, Otto.

293
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:29,736
l'm r eally amazed that you,
of all people, should say that.

294
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:33,371
l don't want him made a martyr.

295
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:37,606
- ln the political situation...
- Ex cuse me if l interrupt.

296
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:43,451
This conversation is quite pointless.
The case is simple.

297
00:31:43,556 --> 00:31:48,289
Either Miklas leaves the theater...

298
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:50,829
...or l do.

299
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,830
That's nonsense.

300
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:57,631
Higher, higher!

301
00:32:48,752 --> 00:32:50,379
Higher, higher!

302
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:56,890
Enough! This isn't a funeral march!

303
00:32:57,994 --> 00:32:59,325
Again.

304
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:03,392
Lights!

305
00:33:41,368 --> 00:33:42,700
Sorry, to interrupt.

306
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:46,068
Dr. Kr oge asks you to
appr ove the next poster.

307
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,869
l must take it to the printer.

308
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:56,873
Can't l get my name spelled
corr ectly even in this theatr e?

309
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,582
My name is not Henrik, but Hendrik!

310
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:04,983
Hendrik Höf gen.

311
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:08,019
One day they'll all
have to mark my name.

312
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,893
Try to understand, doctor.
l can't and won't tie myself down.

313
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:19,370
lt's a gr eat strain
to stay under contract.

314
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:21,372
l must be fr ee. Fr ee.

315
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:25,835
l can't be a pr ovincial matinee idol.

316
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:28,672
No, no, l don't want to be that.

317
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,715
Y ou want to leave Hamburg for good?

318
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,978
l don't know yet.

319
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:44,553
The Pr ofessor invited me to a Berlin
guest appearance. One never knows.

320
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:47,628
By the way, Dora Martin
will be my partner.

321
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:51,663
Good. Then accept the offer.

322
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:54,693
Thank you.

323
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:59,135
Berlin.

324
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:06,633
Thank you, ladies. Till tomorr ow.

325
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:08,140
Goodbye.

326
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,812
So you ar e Höf gen.

327
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,144
Y ou have friends her e.

328
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:23,450
Some of them, who understand
theater, r ecommended you to me.

329
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:30,655
Y our father-in-law, too,
when we met at the ministry.

330
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:35,597
And Dora Martin, as well.

331
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:47,902
ln r eal life l may seem a bit
nondescript, but not, l hope on stage.

332
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:54,342
My father-in-law once aptly described
my ability to transform myself.

333
00:36:55,987 --> 00:37:01,289
Well, we'll give you a try.

334
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:10,132
Don't expect too much.
l'm not offering anything big.

335
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:16,399
Y ou ar e pr obably used to a
r easonable income in Hamburg.

336
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:21,273
Her e you'll have less.
Have you expensive tastes?

337
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:27,143
Money doesn't inter est me.
My needs ar e modest.

338
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:32,581
All l need every day is a clean shirt
and a dr op of cologne.

339
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:37,459
Discuss the details with
Miss Bernhardt.

340
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:41,428
Please give my r egards
to your father-in-law.

341
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:45,694
- Hendrik Höf gen.
- Oh, yes. Bernhardt.

342
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:47,828
Her e's your contract.

343
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:49,095
Thank you.

344
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:52,200
- May l?
- Please.

345
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,578
700 marks a month, less tax.
Y ou agr ee to play as cast.

346
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:16,553
Please give these flowers...

347
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:21,530
..and this card to Ms. Martin, will you?

348
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:25,900
THANKS !

349
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,987
Well, Hendrik Höf gen.

350
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:50,889
Now you'r e a beginner again.

351
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,061
Hamburg's fame, r outine and
security all lie behind you.

352
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:01,604
Now you must summon
up all your str ength.

353
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:13,807
And we'll work off that blubber.

354
00:40:42,537 --> 00:40:46,303
- Who is that?
- Dora Martin's Hamburg actor lover.

355
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:50,137
- No, Miss Bernhardt's.
- Y ou'r e misinformed, dear.

356
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,443
So glad you wer e able to come,
despite all your work.

357
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:58,510
May l intr oduce some
of your admir ers?

358
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:03,988
Mr. Davidson of the London Times.
Caser von Muck, Mr. Müller-Andr ea.

359
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:24,240
Mind you ar en't influenced by
the pr evailing cultur e Bolshevism.

360
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:25,934
What do you mean?

361
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:31,716
German cultur e can only be r enewed
if it r eturns to its national r oots...

362
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:34,250
...to its essence of blood and soil.

363
00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:40,382
Russian ravings or Fr ench farces ar e
alien to the spirit the nation needs.

364
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,809
Have you met Mr. Höf gen?

365
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:07,246
Berlin's new star, according to
tomorr ow's London Times.

366
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,342
l've seen you on stage.
Y ou danced, didn't you?

367
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:15,117
Y es, l like dancing.
l had a good teacher.

368
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:18,087
l'd like to model your head.

369
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:27,524
No necktie and no gold we've got
We'r e just a very shabby lot

370
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:31,463
At which the bourgeois spits

371
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,036
The bourgeois with polished boots
And medals on morning suits

372
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:41,275
And every morning he ablutes
for church, or for the Ritz

373
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,814
Wher e does the bourgeois get it all?
His guns his celebration ball?

374
00:42:49,056 --> 00:42:51,752
He steals it wher e he can

375
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:56,286
He makes it hard for us to r ob
Takes it all, the gr eedy slob

376
00:42:56,397 --> 00:43:01,300
Exploits the poor and wr ecks the job
of every working man

377
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:09,635
Oh, if so wealthy l could be,
Commit like him grand larceny

378
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:12,575
All honor ed since my birth

379
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:18,750
lf then l met someone l knew,
Y ou filthy lot, l'd spit at you

380
00:43:18,852 --> 00:43:24,721
That's all you dogs ar e worth!

381
00:43:30,862 --> 00:43:33,889
Get the Jews out of her e !

382
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,409
They ar e completely drunk.

383
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:56,146
Now one of the most famous
State Theater actors, Hendrik Höf gen.

384
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:05,151
Forget State Theater and fame.
l am your comrade Hendrik Höf gen.

385
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:14,861
What does the pr oletariat want?
That nobody should rule !

386
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:21,508
What does the pr oletariat want?
That nobody should rule !

387
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:27,149
Nobody shall give orders
Nobody shall be a slave

388
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:32,287
Fr eedom, equality for all souls

389
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:35,556
l'll dictate. Headline :

390
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:42,294
Actor Höf gen wins
Berlin workers' hearts overnight.

391
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:44,193
New paragraph.

392
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:47,627
- Hendrik?
- Hello.

393
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:55,136
l bought this pictur e at the
antique dealer. Y ou don't mind?

394
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,972
Why should l mind?

395
00:44:57,178 --> 00:45:00,273
Y ou can admir e it
while l go and change.

396
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:41,210
l love you, Barbara. Not only
your father and grandmother.

397
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:44,289
l love you... l, Hendrik Höf gen.

398
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:02,801
Welcome to my home,
dear Sebastian.

399
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:05,907
The theater awaits me.

400
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,606
Up!

401
00:47:18,813 --> 00:47:19,711
Up!

402
00:47:20,514 --> 00:47:21,606
Two !

403
00:47:22,284 --> 00:47:23,375
Thr ee !

404
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:25,076
Four!

405
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,677
Five !

406
00:47:26,854 --> 00:47:27,878
Six !

407
00:47:28,122 --> 00:47:32,149
Führ er!
We ar e our people's str ength!

408
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:35,023
We shall cr eate a new world!

409
00:47:35,196 --> 00:47:37,994
- What's your father's job?
- Road digger!

410
00:47:38,132 --> 00:47:40,066
- And your father's?
- Farmer!

411
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:43,466
- And yours?
- Teacher. He educates us!

412
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,165
- And your father?
- Baker. He bakes our br ead!

413
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:49,901
Mine's a miller. He grinds our grain!

414
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,068
A doctor. He makes us healthy!

415
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:54,237
Bricklayer. He builds our houses!

416
00:47:54,347 --> 00:47:56,178
- Conductor!
- Electrician!

417
00:47:56,282 --> 00:48:00,547
We ar e the sons of one people,
we all have the same goal!

418
00:48:00,653 --> 00:48:03,486
Unity and str ength!
We follow the Führ er!

419
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:10,758
No. That's not convincing enough.
Say it like this...

420
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:13,763
- Again... one, two, thr ee.
- Unity and str ength!

421
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:17,198
- Again... one, two, thr ee.
- Unity and str ength!

422
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:18,360
Again!

423
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,404
Unity and str ength!

424
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:23,473
- Louder! Again!
- Unity and str ength!

425
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:24,972
We follow the Führ er!

426
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:30,537
Blood is a very special juice...

427
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:38,484
... let us in depths of sensuousness
assuage our burning passions.

428
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,921
No bounds and goals ar e set for you.

429
00:48:42,026 --> 00:48:45,825
Y ou find your pleasur e.
A fleeing tr easur e.

430
00:48:45,963 --> 00:48:51,923
May you enjoy the prize you get.
Help yourself and don't be coy.

431
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:54,595
But listen, it's not a question of joy.

432
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:58,162
To knowledge l'm devoted,
most painful gratification.

433
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:01,210
Most hateful love,
most vexing stimulation.

434
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:07,909
Believe me, who countless years
on this hard nourishment has fed.

435
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:14,217
That fr om cradle to the grave, no
human can digest so stale a br ead.

436
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,656
Believe me, worlds
celestial and infernal...

437
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:21,594
...for one divinity wer e made.

438
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:24,825
He exists in eternal light.

439
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:30,234
But us, into the darkness, has
conveyed ther e's day and night alone.

440
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:31,601
Y et l want that!

441
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,006
That's well worth hearing.
But ther e's one thing l fear.

442
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:39,978
For time is short, but art is long.

443
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:44,814
lf l thought you sought mor e teaching,
cultivate a poet fond of pr eaching.

444
00:49:44,986 --> 00:49:47,078
Let his thoughts wander.

445
00:49:47,188 --> 00:49:50,749
And every noble quality upon
your br ow let him bestow...

446
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:53,520
...the lion's courage,
the buck's swiftness.

447
00:49:53,627 --> 00:49:56,755
The ltalian's fiery blood,
the north's enduring pluck.

448
00:49:56,864 --> 00:50:00,993
He'll teach you the secr et vile
of magnanimity steeped in guile.

449
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:06,003
May his youthful drives uncover
to make of you an ardent lover.

450
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:14,445
I'd like to meet a scholar of such fame
to Micr ocosm l'd change his name.

451
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,748
So what am l, if it's not possible
the paragon of humanity to attain...

452
00:50:20,853 --> 00:50:22,878
...towards all my senses strain?

453
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:27,425
Y ou'r e in the end just what you ar e.

454
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:31,495
Put on the wigs of a million curls.

455
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:36,195
Put your feet in elevating socks.

456
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:41,505
Y ou'll stay for ever what you ar e !

457
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,527
Bravo !

458
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,893
Wonderful!
Y ou wer e fantastic, Hendrik.

459
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,667
Y ou wer e born to play Mephisto.

460
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,337
Y ou say that with a
touch of malice, Dora.

461
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:25,505
Not true, l don't detest
people for what they ar e.

462
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:29,710
- Anyway, thank you for coming.
- Let's skip the cliches.

463
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:33,410
- What's your next pr oject?
- l'm learning English.

464
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:35,387
English? Why?

465
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:39,517
- l'll be working in America.
- But why?

466
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:43,027
Her e the curtain's descending.
Haven't you noticed?

467
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:49,400
Y ou'r e at the top her e, hit after hit.
Thousands ador e you. So why go?

468
00:51:49,503 --> 00:51:53,463
Thousands! Soon they'll be
raving about others.

469
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:59,312
Ther e'll always be theater,
no matter what happens in Germany.

470
00:51:59,613 --> 00:52:03,140
No matter what happens in Germany?
Y ou r eally mean that?

471
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:10,416
Well, all the best.
l'm leaving in a few days.

472
00:52:11,459 --> 00:52:13,949
ln a few days?

473
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:16,585
l don't want to wait till it's too late.

474
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:19,764
But you'll always do well, Hendrik...

475
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,797
... no matter what happens
in Germany.

476
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:33,574
lt's open.

477
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:42,046
Mephisto, l never lock the door.
need neither bolts nor life insurance.

478
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:46,317
- l bet you've taken one out.
- l need no life insurance.

479
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:49,690
Sit down, sir, in my new home.

480
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:53,090
Y ou could have
gotten me a nicer flat.

481
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,896
- Have you r egister ed with the police?
- Y es, sir.

482
00:52:58,002 --> 00:53:00,767
What did the landlord say?

483
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:05,070
Nothing. He was drunk,
humming a song...

484
00:53:05,176 --> 00:53:07,701
No neckties, no gold we've got...

485
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:11,578
He gave me the key and l moved in.

486
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:19,688
l've been longing to see you.

487
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:25,888
- And how's your wife?
- She's with her father, thank God.

488
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:30,899
They'r e worried about the Republic.

489
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:44,309
ln Hamburg, the for eigners wer e also
very worried about Germany...

490
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:49,007
...about German cultur e,
whose Number-One-Parr ot you ar e.

491
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:53,919
As if a peril thr eatened it. What ar e
the Jews planning against Germany?

492
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,457
Even the whor es wonder...

493
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,723
...and they don't car e about
the pant color as long as it has a fly.

494
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:04,664
Barbara understands politics,
doesn't she?

495
00:54:05,066 --> 00:54:07,125
ls she keeping an eye on you?

496
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:13,005
No. Mostly her opinions
ar e the opposite of mine.

497
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:17,339
- Have you told her so?
- No. What point would ther e be?

498
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:20,405
Words don't say everything.

499
00:54:22,749 --> 00:54:27,847
l'd like very much to sleep with you.

500
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:30,453
Shall l make up the bed?

501
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:32,314
Y es!

502
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:38,564
Hendrik! Hendrik!

503
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:44,068
Hendrik, wake up! Didn't you her e?

504
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,434
Y ou'r e her e alr eady?

505
00:54:46,572 --> 00:54:49,097
l came on the early train,
because of you.

506
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:52,609
- What's the matter?
- When did you go to bed?

507
00:54:52,878 --> 00:54:56,507
l'm tir ed. l was tossing all night.
Why?

508
00:54:56,615 --> 00:55:00,484
The Nazis have won the elections.
Y ou know who became Chancellor?

509
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:01,643
No.

510
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:08,356
Do you hear that?

511
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:11,356
Do you hear that?

512
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:19,437
That Bohemian corporal has
become Chancellor?

513
00:55:19,536 --> 00:55:20,902
Her e, r ead it.

514
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:25,338
l thought ther e was nothing
to fear fr om the Nazis.

515
00:55:27,112 --> 00:55:30,376
Remember that business with Miklas?

516
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:38,221
That could have unpleasant
consequences. What do we do now?

517
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:44,716
Keep a clear head and don't panic.

518
00:55:45,795 --> 00:55:50,756
So, the Austrian clown has
become Reichs-Chancellor.

519
00:55:52,135 --> 00:55:57,198
But ther e still is the opposition, no?
Communists and Social Democrats.

520
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,775
They'll make sur e he doesn't
get too big for his boots.

521
00:56:02,077 --> 00:56:05,808
Perhaps ther e'll even
be armed r esistance.

522
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:14,546
And even if the Nazis stay in power,
why should it concern me?

523
00:56:14,656 --> 00:56:16,180
l'm fr om the Rhineland.

524
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:20,489
So ar e my par ents.
What can happen to us?

525
00:56:20,629 --> 00:56:24,030
On top of that, l'm an actor. No?

526
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:30,767
l go to the theater, play my parts,
then go back home. That's all.

527
00:56:30,872 --> 00:56:34,308
Some people ar e leaving a country...

528
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:38,276
...wher e a car eer in the arts
is now impossible.

529
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:42,974
People will think you don't car e
about anything beyond the limelight?

530
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:47,918
Ther e wer e elections in a democratic
state. One party won, that's all.

531
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:52,981
l've never been inter ested
in politics, so why now?

532
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:56,254
Don't you r ealize
what's happening her e?

533
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:04,163
Don't answer it. l'm not her e,
l'm sick. Say what you want.

534
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,308
ls that any solution? To lock
yourself in, to hide, not be at home?

535
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:17,007
ls that all you can think of,
instead of taking a definite stand?

536
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,779
Definite... this is my answer!
Hamlet! Shakespear e !

537
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:25,846
Either we take a stand or go,
if our fr eedom is in danger.

538
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:30,019
This is the only form of fr eedom
for me, for an actor.

539
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:33,790
Y ou can't hide behind Shakespear e,
on the stage.

540
00:57:33,899 --> 00:57:39,302
Barbara, l'm an actor.
An actor in Germany at all times.

541
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:42,372
Y ou can go away.
Y our father is a famous writer.

542
00:57:42,473 --> 00:57:46,068
Y ou can design sets anywher e,
or buy antiques.

543
00:57:46,177 --> 00:57:49,112
But l need the German language !

544
00:57:49,213 --> 00:57:53,376
l need the motherland, don't you see?

545
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,964
- Who's ther e?
- Otto.

546
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,628
- Who?
- Otto.

547
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,538
- l must talk to you.
- Y ou want some coffee?

548
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:22,305
- No, thanks.
- Tea?

549
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:27,508
Act with us again. lt's the only r eply
we can give to these events.

550
00:58:27,616 --> 00:58:31,609
An appearance by all of us,
a common fr ont.

551
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:34,120
So we don't lose our futur e.

552
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:39,353
Y ou just want to divide the audience?
We must work out our tactics.

553
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:42,054
Tactics will force us to our knees.

554
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:45,155
We must fight this
crushing demagogy.

555
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:52,296
lt's our job to tell the hesitators:
Now is the time to r esist dictatorship!

556
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,374
Otto, in the first place, we'r e actors...

557
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:57,603
No, not a pr otest on the str eet.
l'm talking about the stage.

558
00:58:57,811 --> 00:59:00,541
Still, l think we should
wait a few days.

559
00:59:00,682 --> 00:59:03,207
We must do something
immediately. Tonight.

560
00:59:05,919 --> 00:59:10,049
Otto, l'd rather stay
with the r eserves.

561
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:21,228
Thank God
l've no performance today.

562
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:31,601
GERMAN RElCHS-MAlL

563
00:59:38,985 --> 00:59:42,511
Film contract, locations in Budapest...

564
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:48,250
... leading r ole.
Pr oduction Manager Altenburger.

565
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,126
She r eally is a beauty.
She's sitting by the side altar.

566
00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:03,229
Cut! V ery good!
The second one.

567
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:10,371
Now the scene wher e they follow her
to the Fishermen's Bastion.

568
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:22,792
What's going on?

569
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,655
What's going on?

570
01:00:24,995 --> 01:00:26,894
Ar e we done for today?
Can we go?

571
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:29,965
- The Reichstag was burned down.
- What?

572
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:34,229
They say the communists set fir e to it.

573
01:00:43,946 --> 01:00:48,076
Y our wife wants you
to join her in Paris.

574
01:00:48,217 --> 01:00:53,483
She didn't dar e phone you. Don't go
back to Berlin. l'm moving to Vienna.

575
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:58,615
Many of your Berlin friends have
vanished lately. Otto Ulrichs is one.

576
01:00:58,926 --> 01:01:03,488
We must be pr epar ed for anything.
l fear we'll never be able to r eturn.

577
01:01:03,732 --> 01:01:10,068
The Nazis have blacklists.
Y our wife and you ar e on them.

578
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:15,207
Please, never go back to Berlin.
Hendrik, pr omise me that.

579
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:17,569
Please !

580
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,624
Cheers, and many thanks!

581
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:46,196
Cheers!

582
01:01:46,772 --> 01:01:49,502
To the most beautiful
actr ess in Eur ope !

583
01:02:17,702 --> 01:02:19,966
When ar e you going home?

584
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,640
l'll stay a few mor e days in Budapest.

585
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:27,939
Then l'm going to see about
a contract in Vienna.

586
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:30,477
l understand you, Hendrik.

587
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:36,751
l'll tell you now, l'm not going
back to Germany, either.

588
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,321
l signed you for this part...

589
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:44,019
...so you, too, could slip away,
if you want to.

590
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:49,057
The film studio gave me your
addr ess in Budapest.

591
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:52,430
l hope my letter r eaches you.
l'm in Berlin now.

592
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,936
l've landed a part in a comedy.

593
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:59,064
During the shoot l met the
actr ess Lotte Lindenthal.

594
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:04,336
She's friendly with a National
Socialist who's very powerful now.

595
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:10,078
She's wonderful. She never flaunts
what gr eat influence she has.

596
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:16,522
l told her you wer e abr oad and didn't
dar e r eturn, for certain r easons.

597
01:03:16,624 --> 01:03:18,455
What's the man afraid of?

598
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:23,224
She said you wer e an eminent artist
and saw Mephisto several times.

599
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:29,327
''We need such actors'', she said, and
she pr omised to speak to her friend.

600
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:34,806
This morning she said: ''No matter
what silly things Höf gen has done...

601
01:03:34,908 --> 01:03:38,743
...when it's an eminent actor,
people ar e tolerant.''

602
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:44,614
Her friend has pr omised that nothing
will happen to you if you r eturn.

603
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:49,017
Hendrik, Berlin awaits you.
Y ou have nothing to fear.

604
01:03:49,123 --> 01:03:53,786
No one can r eplace you.
Those who rule our lives...

605
01:03:53,894 --> 01:03:59,695
... know that the theater is a shelter
for me and people like me...

606
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:03,565
... in which we all feel safe
and have nothing to fear.

607
01:04:03,703 --> 01:04:07,833
lt would be that for you, too.
Theater is a mission.

608
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:11,535
ln true friendship,
yours, Angelika Siebert.

609
01:05:05,995 --> 01:05:06,962
Name?

610
01:05:07,063 --> 01:05:09,030
- Hendrik Höf gen.
- Pr ofession?

611
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:11,055
Actor.

612
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,155
Wher e?

613
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:14,593
At the State Theater in Berlin.

614
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,278
- ls something wr ong?
- No, no.

615
01:05:28,483 --> 01:05:29,541
Thank you.

616
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:34,114
Thank you.

617
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:42,657
l don't know if you'll
feel at home again her e.

618
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:49,427
The spirit is differ ent fr om
that you wer e accustomed to.

619
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:53,606
Cultural Bolshevism is over.

620
01:05:56,143 --> 01:06:01,274
Ther e will no longer be a chance to
appear in your friend's plays...

621
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:07,517
...or those popular Fr ench farces.
We perform German art now.

622
01:06:07,954 --> 01:06:14,518
Frankly, l saw no gr eat r eason
to r ecall you fr om abr oad.

623
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:22,859
But Lotte Lindenthal wants you as
her partner in her comedy debut her e.

624
01:06:23,469 --> 01:06:26,461
l didn't want to displease her.

625
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:35,342
The r ole of elegant friend and seducer
shouldn't cause you any difficulty.

626
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:38,609
l'm so cold.

627
01:06:39,717 --> 01:06:41,582
l'll warm you up.

628
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:45,454
Y our r oom isn't heated
in this dr eadful weather?

629
01:06:45,823 --> 01:06:50,227
ls this how you anticipated my visit?
V ery nice of you!

630
01:06:50,862 --> 01:06:53,660
Ther e's a warm r oom over ther e.
Come.

631
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:56,461
No, l'm in a gr eat hurry today.

632
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,124
lt would warm us up.

633
01:06:58,236 --> 01:07:00,830
No, ther e's no point in this cold flat.

634
01:07:00,937 --> 01:07:03,907
My new maid doesn't
know her duties yet.

635
01:07:04,007 --> 01:07:07,272
Y ou should have told her
your visitor needed warmth.

636
01:07:07,378 --> 01:07:09,845
But l've only just r eturned home.

637
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:13,609
Y ou should have r eturned earlier.

638
01:07:13,717 --> 01:07:16,948
l'm someone you must
wait for, impatiently.

639
01:07:17,053 --> 01:07:21,457
lf l want to meet someone in passing,
l have my husband. And besides...

640
01:07:21,557 --> 01:07:26,426
Wher e did you get this new maid?
She's far too pr etty.

641
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,960
lt's an honor to act with you.

642
01:07:32,068 --> 01:07:35,868
lt's so nice to hear
a warm voice again.

643
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:39,497
l'm happy to hear you say that,
l know you'r e no flatter er.

644
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:44,567
Me, a flatter er? l'm notorious
for telling people the truth.

645
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,012
l like honest people.

646
01:07:58,425 --> 01:08:04,660
lf she turns, everything will be fine.
lf she waves, l've scor ed a triumph.

647
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:11,433
After the Reichstag fir e,
l had to leave Hamburg.

648
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:14,200
Bonetti wears a uniform now.

649
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:17,409
He thr ew me out of the canteen.

650
01:08:17,611 --> 01:08:20,671
''We've got you now, Böck!'' he said.

651
01:08:20,981 --> 01:08:25,110
They almost beat me up,
my landlady thr ew me out.

652
01:08:25,219 --> 01:08:27,015
l had to leave Hamburg.

653
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,351
Ar e you upset that l've come?

654
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:34,483
When l heard you wer e in Berlin,
l found new hope...

655
01:08:34,595 --> 01:08:38,826
...and l just came.
Ar e you angry with me?

656
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:41,158
l'm not angry with you.

657
01:08:42,902 --> 01:08:49,238
Live her e till things settle down,
but don't tell anyone.

658
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:52,936
Just simply disappear without a word.

659
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:59,583
lf l wer e in your position,
l might well commit suicide.

660
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:07,855
l'll buy you a radio, so you'll know
what's happening outside.

661
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:11,928
l've got nobody else
in the world but you.

662
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:15,624
- ls Budapest beautiful?
- l don't know...

663
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:18,326
Y es, quite nice.

664
01:09:18,636 --> 01:09:21,537
l could have gone ther e.
Barbara wasn't with you.

665
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:24,301
They wouldn't have let you
cr oss the border.

666
01:09:24,442 --> 01:09:30,039
l'm a German citizen, too. My father
was pur e German. Why can't l go out?

667
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:35,209
lf you can't understand why,
we'll both be in tr ouble.

668
01:09:36,252 --> 01:09:39,585
- Y ou'r e horrible.
- Y ou'r e an idiot!

669
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:42,987
Go to hell you... you actor!

670
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:14,553
Dear Lotte, may l ask a gr eat favor?
l have to play Mephisto.

671
01:10:15,524 --> 01:10:17,184
l'll see what l can do.

672
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:21,588
l look forward to seeing
you again as Mephisto.

673
01:10:21,696 --> 01:10:26,632
lt's thanks to me you'r e
playing Mephisto again.

674
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:32,897
Certain ministerial circles fear ed
you might r evive your old Faust spirit.

675
01:10:33,006 --> 01:10:37,568
The spirit of cultural Bolshevism,
as it was called.

676
01:10:37,712 --> 01:10:42,648
Well, l succeeded in
overcoming those fears.

677
01:10:43,149 --> 01:10:46,777
Casar, thank you,
thank you very much.

678
01:10:51,091 --> 01:10:53,058
THANK Y OU!

679
01:10:53,192 --> 01:10:55,593
Please give these flowers...

680
01:10:56,529 --> 01:10:58,258
...to Miss Lindenthal.

681
01:11:00,566 --> 01:11:03,000
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

682
01:11:05,004 --> 01:11:06,527
Morning, Mr. Höf gen.

683
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:10,505
Mr. Miklas! Ar e you still ar ound?

684
01:11:10,608 --> 01:11:12,940
- Morning.
- Fine.

685
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:23,445
l've only been her e a short space,
l come with a humility to this place...

686
01:11:24,355 --> 01:11:29,952
...to find a teacher of vocation
who's held by all in veneration.

687
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,758
How pleasant is your courtesy!
A man like many mor e you see.

688
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:35,991
Have you looked ar ound?

689
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:39,195
Take me as your student.

690
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:42,329
l come with courage and my youth.

691
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,432
l want to study with all my heart.

692
01:11:46,543 --> 01:11:48,773
Y ou've come to the right place.

693
01:11:48,879 --> 01:11:50,710
l feel like going home l fear.

694
01:11:50,814 --> 01:11:54,306
ln that gr eat hall
l won't like it at all.

695
01:11:54,617 --> 01:11:58,519
Y ou see no grass, you see no tr ee.

696
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:04,582
And in the classes we ar e taught
l lose my hearing, sight and thought.

697
01:12:04,827 --> 01:12:06,795
lt all depends on habit.

698
01:12:07,355 --> 01:12:11,256
Seeing the br east, a child
might accept the gift unwillingly.

699
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,156
But soon it sucks in delight.

700
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:17,698
So will you, on wisdom's br east,
enjoy it daily with mor e zest.

701
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:21,558
Ar ound her neck l'll
cling with pleasur e...

702
01:12:21,668 --> 01:12:25,798
... but tell me how can l
find this tr easur e?

703
01:12:26,006 --> 01:12:30,409
When you continue on your way,
which faculty will make your day?

704
01:12:30,544 --> 01:12:32,568
ls this wher e the cut comes?

705
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:36,144
The art of medicine
is not hard, you know.

706
01:12:36,249 --> 01:12:38,808
Y ou study the world, big and small.

707
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:42,445
And in the end you let them go
when God demands it.

708
01:12:42,555 --> 01:12:45,218
Y ou'll try in vain to learn all science.

709
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:48,384
Each man just learns what he can.

710
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:52,691
But he who grasps every chance
he is the worthy man.

711
01:12:52,798 --> 01:12:58,168
Y ou ar e still of pleasing build
with self-confidence at last instilled...

712
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:01,830
...others will have confidence in you.

713
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:05,205
Especially learn
the women to enthrall.

714
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:09,007
Eternal moans, a thousand ills.

715
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:12,811
Ther e's just one place to cur e them.

716
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:19,151
lf you've honor to some degr ee
one may allow some shar ed intimacy.

717
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:26,590
A title helps to make her certain
your art ex ceeds that of your peers.

718
01:13:26,697 --> 01:13:31,100
And may grant you a glimpse of which
another schemes for many years.

719
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:34,193
Her pulse you must learn to feel.

720
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:38,707
And burning looks you
then must steal.

721
01:13:38,808 --> 01:13:46,773
Her slender hips ar e then embraced
to see how tightly she is laced.

722
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:51,079
That's what l could car e for.

723
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:57,625
Gray, my friend is all theory.
And gr een the golden tr ee of life.

724
01:13:59,127 --> 01:14:00,651
That's the way.

725
01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:27,213
l gr eet the learned gentleman!
Y ou made me to sweat pr ofusely.

726
01:14:27,322 --> 01:14:29,915
- What is your name?
- The question's odd...

727
01:14:30,024 --> 01:14:32,686
...for someone who idle talk despises.

728
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:36,786
Who, far r emoved fr om worldly show
seeks only academic prizes.

729
01:14:37,597 --> 01:14:41,694
With you, one knows your game
generally by your very name.

730
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:46,397
lt's evident, Sir e
if one's called a liar.

731
01:14:47,074 --> 01:14:48,062
Who ar e you?

732
01:14:48,174 --> 01:14:50,404
l'm a part of that force...

733
01:14:50,544 --> 01:14:54,240
...that always craves evil
and always cr eates good.

734
01:14:54,347 --> 01:14:55,871
What is this riddle?

735
01:14:55,982 --> 01:14:57,973
l'm the spirit who negates.

736
01:14:58,084 --> 01:15:02,453
And rightly so, for all cr eation
is worthy of annihilation.

737
01:15:02,554 --> 01:15:05,217
So it wer e better,
nothing wer e cr eated.

738
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:10,388
And so everything you've stated
is sin, destruction, devilment.

739
01:15:10,529 --> 01:15:13,020
Remains my actual element.

740
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:18,134
Good evening. The Prime Minister
invites you to his box.

741
01:15:20,038 --> 01:15:21,027
Y es.

742
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,541
lt's all going like clockwork.

743
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:53,692
May l intr oduce you to
my distinguished colleague?

744
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,037
Ah, our Mephistoles.

745
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,152
Congratulations.

746
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:17,623
That mask is perfect, it's evil itself.
lt's sacr ed evil.

747
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:24,296
Y et, your eyes ar e so kind,
your handshake so soft. lt's strange...

748
01:16:25,034 --> 01:16:32,099
... it seems the secr et of acting is
to portray str ength, yet one is weak.

749
01:16:36,277 --> 01:16:42,113
l imagine you've pr epar ed
for this r ole for a long time.

750
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:44,612
All my life, Prime Minister.

751
01:16:45,286 --> 01:16:50,314
That's the only way.
That is the secr et of gr eatness.

752
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,789
Br eak a leg.

753
01:17:27,927 --> 01:17:30,395
Carry on the good work, Mephistoles.

754
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:44,840
Höf gen r esidence.

755
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:46,636
Lotte Lindenthal.

756
01:17:50,148 --> 01:17:51,045
Höf gen.

757
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:52,411
- Hendrik?
- Y es.

758
01:17:52,516 --> 01:17:55,713
Will you come to us
after tonight's performance?

759
01:17:55,886 --> 01:17:58,184
Ther e'll be just a few friends her e.

760
01:17:58,288 --> 01:18:02,190
With pleasur e. Thank you very much.

761
01:18:04,128 --> 01:18:11,034
Böck!
Just a few friends will be ther e.

762
01:18:17,073 --> 01:18:19,099
Am l not an incr edible villain?

763
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:22,570
Why a villain?
Y ou'r e just successful, Mr. Höf gen.

764
01:18:22,812 --> 01:18:27,875
To the r enewal of German cultur e.
Long live the actors.

765
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:39,723
Our theater has many elements that
have nothing to do with Germany.

766
01:18:39,896 --> 01:18:44,492
We must set up a customs contr ol
of the mind for cultur e smugglers...

767
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:50,932
...to stop for eign elements poisoning
German literatur e and theater.

768
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,877
This can't be left entir ely
to our fr ontier guards.

769
01:18:56,144 --> 01:19:00,273
Everyone must cooperate
in this contr ol.

770
01:19:00,614 --> 01:19:02,776
- Am l understood?
- Y es, General.

771
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:06,482
Ther e ar e many who
don't understand.

772
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:10,522
Look at this painting, my Mephisto.

773
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,984
A masterpiece of
German r omanticism.

774
01:19:16,363 --> 01:19:21,891
Wher e did l find it? At an art dealer
with an for eign accent.

775
01:19:22,002 --> 01:19:25,437
l had it r estor ed. No, no...

776
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:30,535
...the futur e of painting doesn't
belong to the Liebermanns.

777
01:19:30,977 --> 01:19:33,275
Y our Mephisto occupies my mind.

778
01:19:33,579 --> 01:19:37,812
Y ou've br ought him alive.
He's a hell of a guy.

779
01:19:38,818 --> 01:19:41,753
lsn't ther e a little of him in all of us?

780
01:19:42,688 --> 01:19:47,489
l mean, isn't ther e a bit of Mephisto
in every German?

781
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:53,057
Wouldn't our enemies love it if we
had nothing but the soul of Faust?

782
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:58,727
No, Mephisto is also
a German national her o.

783
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:01,431
lt's just something we
mustn't tell people.

784
01:20:03,307 --> 01:20:05,071
l must go now.

785
01:20:05,276 --> 01:20:10,145
Come to my office at 10:30,
the day after tomorr ow.

786
01:20:10,248 --> 01:20:14,048
Some for eign journalists
want to know many things.

787
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:18,814
Above all, what 'Germany' means
today, and the German cultur e.

788
01:20:18,923 --> 01:20:24,828
l'll tell them. Y ou can elaborate on
what l say about theater, for ex ample.

789
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:29,794
Painting, architectur e, sculptur e,
plenty to write about.

790
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,059
l want them to be
informed by experts.

791
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,101
Tell me, why do you have
such a limp handshake?

792
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:55,442
So, we meet again. How time flies!
Y ou wer e wonderful as Mephisto.

793
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:59,678
Now you act him mor e forcefully.
But l liked the other one, too.

794
01:21:59,785 --> 01:22:04,449
l sensed it in the seed of what
can now be unfolded to the full.

795
01:22:04,557 --> 01:22:08,117
l also liked you in the play
with Lotte Lindenthal.

796
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:12,391
The ideal actr ess to portray
the ideal German woman.

797
01:22:12,497 --> 01:22:19,130
What ar e we doing her e? Why is
he wasting his time with for eigners?

798
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:26,506
He said they'r e inter ested in German
cultur e. They'll ask a few questions.

799
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:29,340
- l see. Y ou spoke to him?
- Y es.

800
01:22:29,446 --> 01:22:32,574
How ar e you?
Nice to meet you again.

801
01:22:32,683 --> 01:22:36,619
The Prime Minister sent for me.
l hope this doesn't last too long.

802
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:41,487
Always pr oblems with the old statues.
Shall we tear them down or not?

803
01:22:41,592 --> 01:22:44,993
As if that wer e important
for our futur e.

804
01:22:45,362 --> 01:22:47,830
l'd like to sculpt
a bust of you, Höf gen.

805
01:22:47,998 --> 01:22:53,128
What sort of man ar e you? Y our own
face differs amazingly fr om Mephisto.

806
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:56,228
ln private life, you look rather shy.

807
01:22:56,339 --> 01:23:00,469
l'll do a bust of you,
but in clay or in br onze?

808
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:03,874
- What is your face made of?
- Perhaps a mixtur e.

809
01:23:04,447 --> 01:23:09,749
l very much enjoyed your Mephisto.
l only had eyes for you.

810
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:12,047
l'm pr eparing an exhibition.

811
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:16,853
The General wants a pr eview.
Try to come. Her e's my number.

812
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:22,296
lf you have time, give me a ring
and come to my studio.

813
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:26,025
Y ou can r elax while l model you.
How strange your face is.

814
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,966
A German face yet it
changes every moment.

815
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:32,562
That's acting.
The r est is humility and hard work.

816
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:39,677
l've discover ed your secr et.
lt's the surprise effect, right?

817
01:23:41,048 --> 01:23:42,879
The unexpected.

818
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:48,922
l've been watching the way you
appear on stage. Always differ ent.

819
01:23:51,357 --> 01:23:53,484
Sometimes quick, erratic.

820
01:23:53,594 --> 01:23:57,290
Then slow, suddenly,
when the audience is lulled.

821
01:23:57,964 --> 01:24:00,865
But always surprising
and unpr edictable.

822
01:24:02,102 --> 01:24:06,004
Thus you cr eate the feeling
of something original...

823
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:10,770
...even if the spectator
knows your lines by heart.

824
01:24:11,277 --> 01:24:16,373
And your glib tongue, your deliberate
pauses, your pr ecise emphasis.

825
01:24:18,517 --> 01:24:20,451
l think l'm learning fr om you.

826
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,019
lt's important to be unpr edictable.

827
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:30,756
Spectators needn't know what
my next step is or wher e l'm going.

828
01:24:30,896 --> 01:24:34,592
- They'r e not pr epar ed, it's a shock.
- Ex actly.

829
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,828
Y et it was only a change of pace,
or a slightly longer pause.

830
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:43,737
ln the theater it's the others
who make the king a king.

831
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:50,542
Building the r ole is all important;
pianissimo alternating with fortissimo.

832
01:24:50,648 --> 01:24:55,175
Naturally, you need a
certain flair, artistic talent...

833
01:24:55,286 --> 01:24:58,652
...and as l usually say,
a high degr ee of cultur e.

834
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:01,781
When l hear the word cultur e,
l r each for my r evolver.

835
01:25:01,892 --> 01:25:08,161
Bourgeois nonsense ! Bolsheviks
pr each it to win over school teachers.

836
01:25:08,265 --> 01:25:10,699
To say nothing of artists.
lsn't that so?

837
01:25:11,902 --> 01:25:15,770
l wasn't untouched by
Bolshevik tr ends, either.

838
01:25:16,105 --> 01:25:20,132
And l must admit that for a while
l flirted with the left.

839
01:25:21,744 --> 01:25:25,976
Well, anyone can get
involved in some folly.

840
01:25:27,016 --> 01:25:30,473
Those wer e tr oubled times.
Let's have a drink.

841
01:25:39,094 --> 01:25:44,656
General, other deserving artists
committed the follies l did.

842
01:25:44,767 --> 01:25:50,204
l don't forget those paying for sins for
which l've been gener ously pardoned.

843
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,899
l'm pleading for a certain person,
for a friend.

844
01:25:56,544 --> 01:26:01,140
l guarantee he's r eformed.
l'm pleading for Otto Ulrichs.

845
01:26:03,016 --> 01:26:06,179
Otto Ulrichs? Who's he?

846
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,414
He ran the communist cabar et,
'The Storm-Bird' .

847
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:16,723
Well... he must be
a pr etty bad fellow.

848
01:26:16,829 --> 01:26:19,196
No, he's not bad.

849
01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:23,793
A bit rash, l admit.
A bit thoughtless, but not bad.

850
01:26:24,036 --> 01:26:28,996
lf anything, he's too decent.
Once he gives his word, he keeps it.

851
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:49,787
l'm back at the State Theater.

852
01:26:50,896 --> 01:26:54,559
The funny thing is,
l simply can't believe it.

853
01:26:55,967 --> 01:27:01,405
Just as l can't believe
l'm her e with you by the window.

854
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,075
l know it's r eality, but l don't feel it.

855
01:27:29,032 --> 01:27:32,024
- Gr eat.
- Magnificent, r eally.

856
01:27:32,135 --> 01:27:33,898
A German work of art.

857
01:27:34,003 --> 01:27:37,530
Not every German artist is
capable of such work.

858
01:27:38,407 --> 01:27:40,875
lt is a courageous work.

859
01:27:48,318 --> 01:27:49,944
Come, Mephisto.

860
01:27:52,254 --> 01:27:53,812
Y ou sign, too.

861
01:28:01,462 --> 01:28:05,023
What did l pr ophesy?
The exhibition is a success.

862
01:28:24,085 --> 01:28:27,076
Y ou rascal, so you make
secr et visits her e.

863
01:28:29,824 --> 01:28:34,920
lf l may add something personal,
it is a courageous work.

864
01:28:35,029 --> 01:28:38,293
Courageous,
because it captur es our time...

865
01:28:38,431 --> 01:28:43,664
...the beauty of str ength
without bourgeois snobbery.

866
01:28:43,803 --> 01:28:46,499
Contrasting the degenerate taste...

867
01:28:46,872 --> 01:28:49,340
...of the loud-mouths of cultur e.

868
01:28:49,442 --> 01:28:56,347
We see muscles and clear-cut
featur es mankind wants to see.

869
01:28:56,482 --> 01:28:59,383
Str ong and beautiful in his str ength.

870
01:28:59,885 --> 01:29:03,446
Warrior-like and victorious
in his struggle.

871
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:14,966
Hello Hendrik.
That was a wonderful speech.

872
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,360
-Y ou know each other?
-V ery well.

873
01:29:19,904 --> 01:29:21,872
Y ou'r e in Berlin? Since when?

874
01:29:21,973 --> 01:29:25,409
l'm her e because
l want to dine with you.

875
01:29:25,509 --> 01:29:28,775
l haven't seen you for so long.

876
01:29:28,879 --> 01:29:30,780
So wher e will we go?

877
01:29:31,816 --> 01:29:35,718
Y our choice. How's Hamburg?
Surviving without me?

878
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:40,150
l'm in Berlin to have dinner with you.
Hamburg is history.

879
01:29:40,257 --> 01:29:44,784
Y ou'r e out of touch. Kr oge's in
Switzerland. He just vanished.

880
01:29:44,895 --> 01:29:48,661
Didn't even tell his girl. Simply went.

881
01:29:49,865 --> 01:29:51,594
Kr oge is a traitor.

882
01:29:58,474 --> 01:30:00,669
Why must you appear with them?

883
01:30:00,776 --> 01:30:02,573
Because they asked me to.

884
01:30:02,678 --> 01:30:05,578
They ask others, too. Y ou needn't go.

885
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:12,381
Y ou can't r efuse, none of us can.
lf anyone says they do, they'r e lying.

886
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:16,989
Besides, the General's a nice chap
and he knows a lot about the theater.

887
01:30:17,093 --> 01:30:19,890
He's not so closed minded
as most others.

888
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:25,694
A well behaved boy who wants to
enjoy the r ewards for good behavior.

889
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,997
- Y es, l like to be well behaved.
- Because you'r e afraid.

890
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:34,767
- l like it.
- Then you should.

891
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:39,404
lt will be difficult to stay with me
and maintain good behavior.

892
01:30:44,017 --> 01:30:46,611
Damned black woman, right?

893
01:30:46,987 --> 01:30:50,514
l can't help being differ ent
fr om what's allowed her e.

894
01:30:50,624 --> 01:30:54,889
People can spit in my face
in the str eet.

895
01:30:54,995 --> 01:30:57,896
Only l can't do anything about it.

896
01:30:57,997 --> 01:31:02,457
My nose, my hair r emain the same
even if l want something else.

897
01:31:02,568 --> 01:31:07,198
Y et, l'm German, a German Negr o.
German is my mother tongue.

898
01:31:07,306 --> 01:31:10,571
What am l supposed to do?
Wher e should l go?

899
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:14,372
l don't know. l don't even know
what will become of me.

900
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,373
Y ou think only of yourself.

901
01:31:17,549 --> 01:31:21,178
And like an idiot,
l dr eamt of us having a child.

902
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:22,685
That's all we need.

903
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:29,383
ls the child to be to blame, for she
might ruin her father's car eer?

904
01:31:29,493 --> 01:31:31,325
That's enough now!

905
01:31:32,063 --> 01:31:35,624
- That's enough of that now!
- Now it is enough?

906
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:42,429
l can see why your wife
couldn't stand living with you.

907
01:31:44,742 --> 01:31:48,838
Her e... l pinched a photo
of you once. Look at it!

908
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,175
Do you r ecognize yourself?

909
01:31:51,315 --> 01:31:53,215
l must speak to you.

910
01:31:53,684 --> 01:31:56,481
To tell me what you've said
behind my back?

911
01:31:56,586 --> 01:31:58,282
l don't know what you mean.

912
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:02,051
Höf gen would bury his mother alive.
Didn't you say that?

913
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:05,025
l won't dispute that l dislike you.

914
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:08,690
- What do you want?
- l want you to sign this.

915
01:32:08,798 --> 01:32:11,129
My signatur e? What for?

916
01:32:11,334 --> 01:32:15,030
Y ou want a raise?
Or do you collect signatur es...

917
01:32:15,138 --> 01:32:19,198
... because theater safety
r egulations ar e a bit unsafe?

918
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:26,403
Fr om a moral standpoint much seems
unsafe. And l don't mean the theater.

919
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,184
What do you pr otest against?

920
01:32:30,285 --> 01:32:33,777
Against a leadership that
disr egards our rights.

921
01:32:35,157 --> 01:32:38,888
But you wer e in the Nazi party,
back when you wer e in Hamburg.

922
01:32:38,993 --> 01:32:40,585
l'm leaving the party.

923
01:32:42,496 --> 01:32:44,054
That's your business.

924
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:48,835
l'd like to ask you to
r ead our pr otest and sign it.

925
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:55,875
Regardless of my opinion, you ar e
today's leading German actor.

926
01:32:57,345 --> 01:33:00,405
Let me say that
l won't even r ead this thing.

927
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:05,980
Be car eful not to get yourself
and others into r eal tr ouble.

928
01:33:06,354 --> 01:33:08,446
Miklas, you can go to hell.

929
01:33:14,027 --> 01:33:16,928
l won't let a dirty pig like you
pr ovoke me.

930
01:33:34,747 --> 01:33:35,771
Dear God.

931
01:33:38,816 --> 01:33:41,410
Congratulations, my dear Höf gen.

932
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:46,582
Y ou put it pr ecisely.
Some elements must go to the devil.

933
01:33:46,692 --> 01:33:50,149
lf you wer e a soldier,
l'd pr omote you. l'm very pleased.

934
01:33:51,596 --> 01:33:55,191
By the way, you needn't be afraid.

935
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:02,000
For the fun of it, l checked
your hor oscope. lt's ex cellent.

936
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:05,674
- Best of luck, Höf gen.
- Thank you.

937
01:34:12,349 --> 01:34:13,680
Did something happen?

938
01:34:19,089 --> 01:34:20,453
Good morning.

939
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:45,268
Get walking!

940
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:29,421
The management r egr ets that Hans
Miklas has died in a car accident.

941
01:35:33,093 --> 01:35:34,958
How awful, such a young fellow.

942
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:41,491
But, frankly, ther e was something
disquieting about him...

943
01:35:41,567 --> 01:35:43,193
...don't you think?

944
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:47,936
Disquieting...

945
01:36:01,553 --> 01:36:04,147
That was no car accident.

946
01:36:08,359 --> 01:36:11,557
He must have come to you, too,
with that pr otest.

947
01:36:11,662 --> 01:36:16,258
Ar e you insane?
How can you talk such nonsense?

948
01:36:16,935 --> 01:36:20,267
Why shouldn't it have
been a car accident?

949
01:36:20,671 --> 01:36:24,436
The government would stage
a car accident...

950
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:27,136
...all for some unknown actor?

951
01:36:28,446 --> 01:36:31,107
We'r e not in some
tenth-rate melodrama.

952
01:36:31,948 --> 01:36:35,476
People shouldn't cr oss
r oads in heavy traffic.

953
01:36:43,259 --> 01:36:48,492
l've gr eat plans for you. We'r e alone.
Y ou can r efuse and r emain an actor.

954
01:36:49,264 --> 01:36:53,224
But then you can't do as much
for our cause as you could.

955
01:36:55,104 --> 01:36:58,903
Y our speech was good.
l r ealized you'r e not only an actor.

956
01:37:00,209 --> 01:37:06,205
Y ou put the essence into words.
Write your own biography, Hendrik.

957
01:37:07,082 --> 01:37:11,985
Submit it to me, as soon as possible.
Höf gen...

958
01:37:12,821 --> 01:37:17,257
...you will manage the Prussian
State Theater. Y our task is easy:

959
01:37:17,358 --> 01:37:23,160
A full house and a wildly
enthusiastic, audience for you.

960
01:37:23,831 --> 01:37:24,923
Do you understand?

961
01:37:26,767 --> 01:37:32,228
No need to enlarge upon
those matters in Hamburg.

962
01:37:33,373 --> 01:37:38,073
Nor need we mention
the Revolutionary Theater.

963
01:37:38,178 --> 01:37:40,977
Just mention some of
your r oles ther e.

964
01:37:47,254 --> 01:37:51,190
What did you r eally imagine
in Hamburg?

965
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,324
How could you have conceived...

966
01:37:56,563 --> 01:38:02,933
... pr omoting Russian Bolshevism?
Y ou, a German. lncr edible !

967
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:07,002
- Wher e is your wife now?
- ln Paris, l believe.

968
01:38:07,106 --> 01:38:11,634
No, she's in Amsterdam,
working against her Motherland.

969
01:38:11,743 --> 01:38:14,007
They'r e publishing a newspaper.

970
01:38:17,348 --> 01:38:19,749
Y ou don't corr espond with her?

971
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:23,414
We have no contact at all.

972
01:38:23,788 --> 01:38:27,349
Y ou'll get a divorce easily.
l'll see to that.

973
01:38:28,893 --> 01:38:31,691
German citizens
who have left Germany...

974
01:38:31,863 --> 01:38:36,265
...couldn't wipe us out, so they
signed their own death sentence.

975
01:38:36,501 --> 01:38:39,867
Wher e weakness perishes,
humanity becomes healthy.

976
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:43,131
Politics, like theater, is a fight.

977
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,571
Just as every r ebuild
is the start of a new war.

978
01:38:50,047 --> 01:38:52,481
But we'r e not talking about this now.

979
01:38:54,116 --> 01:39:00,180
Hamburg...
''ln a harbor town by the river...''

980
01:39:01,992 --> 01:39:06,860
Lots of for eigners, night clubs, bars.
l understand you perfectly.

981
01:39:08,764 --> 01:39:13,633
But in the Reich's capital?
No offense, we'r e men, but...

982
01:39:13,803 --> 01:39:19,468
What's this Hamburg souvenir
doing her e? Juliette Martens.

983
01:39:21,109 --> 01:39:23,135
ls she kept by you?

984
01:39:27,949 --> 01:39:31,543
Y ou once, rightfully, said...

985
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,515
... Pr ofessor Bruckner was
not a man of the futur e.

986
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:39,888
And, even mor e rightly,
you parted fr om his daughter.

987
01:39:40,795 --> 01:39:44,992
lf you have such a good instinct
for a healthy, clean attitude...

988
01:39:45,633 --> 01:39:48,500
...what's this Negr o-woman
doing in Berlin?

989
01:39:51,405 --> 01:39:52,804
Mephisto...

990
01:39:55,009 --> 01:40:00,275
... it defies racial purity.
Don't even keep her pictur e at home.

991
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:01,569
General...

992
01:40:01,682 --> 01:40:03,547
Wait, l haven't finished.

993
01:40:05,019 --> 01:40:08,681
l hope you completely
understood me.

994
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:13,425
- Y es.
- So?

995
01:40:14,861 --> 01:40:18,194
- She's not to come to any harm.
- Leave that to me.

996
01:40:19,731 --> 01:40:22,963
l'd like to r equest, Prime Minister...

997
01:40:23,068 --> 01:40:26,732
...that she'd be allowed
to leave Germany unharmed.

998
01:40:26,838 --> 01:40:33,767
Agr eed. She'll be taken to the fr ontier
and good-bye. That's what we'll do.

999
01:40:34,346 --> 01:40:39,682
And you'll hold a pr ess confer ence,
giving information about the theater.

1000
01:40:39,851 --> 01:40:42,819
The r epertoir e, plans
and your performances.

1001
01:40:43,155 --> 01:40:48,717
ln October ther e'll be a big cultural
event in our Paris embassy.

1002
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:51,158
l'd like you to attend it.

1003
01:40:58,668 --> 01:41:02,298
Böck. l bet they know about him, too.

1004
01:41:02,673 --> 01:41:07,075
Böck, Böck, my note-book.

1005
01:41:09,412 --> 01:41:10,880
Böck stays.

1006
01:41:13,616 --> 01:41:16,449
- Her e it is.
- Give it to me.

1007
01:41:18,722 --> 01:41:22,885
l have to call friends.
l urgently need a friend.

1008
01:41:23,459 --> 01:41:28,021
- Find me a friend.
- But you've so many friends.

1009
01:41:30,099 --> 01:41:31,293
Friends...

1010
01:41:43,612 --> 01:41:47,980
Call Miss Nicoletta von Niebuhr.
Find the number and call her.

1011
01:41:57,191 --> 01:41:59,159
Shall l make coffee, or tea?

1012
01:41:59,293 --> 01:42:02,262
Shall l become manager? Y es or no?

1013
01:42:03,364 --> 01:42:06,992
Can l? May l? Must l?

1014
01:42:07,702 --> 01:42:11,159
ls it my duty?
Can l make myself useful?

1015
01:42:11,272 --> 01:42:15,105
l mean, can l help anyone?
And if so, should l?

1016
01:42:16,243 --> 01:42:19,906
Or shall l look at it as a new r ole?

1017
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,173
Or shall l emigrate to America?

1018
01:42:22,281 --> 01:42:25,547
l can earn as much in films
as Dora Martin.

1019
01:42:26,185 --> 01:42:30,144
lf l accept such an office
of this government, then...

1020
01:42:33,726 --> 01:42:35,626
Do l want to, at all?

1021
01:42:37,429 --> 01:42:39,226
They need me.

1022
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:42,860
l was about to emigrate...

1023
01:42:42,968 --> 01:42:47,495
...and the Prussian Minister
asks me to r escue his theater.

1024
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:50,574
Tomorr ow morning l must
give him an answer.

1025
01:42:51,843 --> 01:42:56,543
Heaven evidently has
gr eat plans for me.

1026
01:42:56,715 --> 01:42:58,113
Then you've won.

1027
01:43:00,618 --> 01:43:02,347
Would you help me?

1028
01:43:03,988 --> 01:43:06,286
l'd be pr oud of you.

1029
01:43:09,426 --> 01:43:11,952
Y es, l'll help you Hendrik.

1030
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:28,702
lf only one could live for ever.

1031
01:43:38,688 --> 01:43:43,182
Her e's your passport for France.
Y ou have five minutes to pack.

1032
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:44,758
Y es, but why?

1033
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:47,125
We'r e waiting. Hurry up.

1034
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:01,074
Y ou needn't thank me for this raise.

1035
01:44:01,176 --> 01:44:04,703
l made it a condition for
taking over this job.

1036
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,677
Everything's cover ed with dust.

1037
01:44:07,249 --> 01:44:13,085
lf you don't clean the dr essing r ooms
as well as all the others...

1038
01:44:13,688 --> 01:44:17,088
...you may have to look
for another job.

1039
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:22,828
l hope we'll get along. lf you have
any pr oblems, come to me.

1040
01:44:22,931 --> 01:44:26,627
l would like to tr eat you all to coffee.

1041
01:44:28,636 --> 01:44:32,834
Allow me to give you the money.
l'm sorry l can't come with you.

1042
01:44:33,007 --> 01:44:35,703
Joachim would like to speak to you.

1043
01:44:35,808 --> 01:44:37,070
Wait, Hannelor e !

1044
01:44:37,844 --> 01:44:39,675
Wait, Hannelor e !

1045
01:44:45,018 --> 01:44:47,748
So, now he can enter.

1046
01:44:47,987 --> 01:44:54,756
Please consider decent r oles for me.
Y ou'r e not like the other managers.

1047
01:44:54,861 --> 01:44:57,921
Y ou'r e an actor yourself.
Y ou understand.

1048
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:02,057
l must act as if he's
saying something important.

1049
01:45:03,802 --> 01:45:08,102
When you talk to actors, you must put
them at ease. That goes for me, too.

1050
01:45:08,273 --> 01:45:14,973
No, l don't like Pr emier es. All night
one has to wear a big, fr ozen smile.

1051
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,445
l hate that.

1052
01:45:19,517 --> 01:45:23,954
Y ou think it's a good costume?
l don't! l think it's terrible !

1053
01:45:24,822 --> 01:45:27,485
Good morning, Mr. Kappelmüller.
How ar e you?

1054
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:29,684
- Good.
- How's the family?

1055
01:45:29,794 --> 01:45:33,593
So your daughter graduated as
a hairdr esser. Maybe we can use her.

1056
01:45:34,498 --> 01:45:35,829
Good morning.

1057
01:45:37,835 --> 01:45:43,739
Haven't you noticed? New suit,
new shoes, new manager, no? Well.

1058
01:45:44,107 --> 01:45:49,374
...ex-Bolshevik Höf gen, manager of
the Prussian State Theater...

1059
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:54,177
... is letting his former comrade
appear in his pr oduction of Hamlet.

1060
01:46:00,056 --> 01:46:04,390
Hannelor e ! Was the cast list
for Hamlet posted yet?

1061
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:05,551
Not yet.

1062
01:46:06,296 --> 01:46:10,527
Good. Let's wait another two days.
Thank you.

1063
01:46:16,372 --> 01:46:19,466
l must offer them mor e
than old comrades.

1064
01:46:19,741 --> 01:46:24,906
Y ou must cultivate connections.
That's the essence of the system.

1065
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:29,506
Let me tell you, yesterday l went to
the Prussian State Theater...

1066
01:46:29,617 --> 01:46:34,611
... it was Faust and the name of some
white-faced clown was Mephisto.

1067
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:39,624
What a joke ! And Mephisto by some
man called Höf gen, it was terrible !

1068
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:44,186
l'd rather go to the Bavarian
People's Theater. Goodbye then.

1069
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:47,694
Why am l doing all this?

1070
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:50,492
Because l enjoy it.

1071
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:56,041
l must enjoy amateur plays and use
actors that ar e blonde not talented.

1072
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:58,441
Most ar e totally untalented.

1073
01:46:58,612 --> 01:47:03,071
A Frankfurt audience
applauded Marquis Posa's...

1074
01:47:03,183 --> 01:47:07,346
...'Give us fr eedom of thought' .
Performance stopped, play withdrawn.

1075
01:47:07,453 --> 01:47:12,186
ln Munich, 'The Robbers', withdrawn.
Schiller, our national poet!

1076
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:17,160
They want to pr oduce plays by
German authors. But what authors?

1077
01:47:17,296 --> 01:47:23,256
Those who haven't emigrated
ar en't allowed to write, or won't.

1078
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:29,307
lt's simply impossible to offer
theater worthy of the name.

1079
01:47:29,475 --> 01:47:36,744
Unless l dig up a couple of old farces.
All Rococco wigs and white faces.

1080
01:47:39,818 --> 01:47:46,451
The joke is that the r egime now sees
Shakespear e as one of our own.

1081
01:47:46,557 --> 01:47:50,857
Let's do 'As Y ou Like lt',
'Wher e the Banished Return.'

1082
01:47:51,161 --> 01:47:55,154
Show the opponents of dictatorship
that the will for fr eedom still lives.

1083
01:47:55,265 --> 01:47:59,030
l didn't hear that!
l can't possibly have heard that!

1084
01:48:06,076 --> 01:48:08,374
Am l not an incr edible villain?

1085
01:48:10,179 --> 01:48:12,875
lsn't what l'm doing insane?

1086
01:48:18,754 --> 01:48:22,281
''Fürst and Niklisch, both on
the staff of your theater...

1087
01:48:22,592 --> 01:48:27,585
...on gr ounds of German
racial purity... dismiss them.''

1088
01:48:28,698 --> 01:48:30,689
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1089
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,361
- Well, how ar e you?
- Fine.

1090
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:42,233
- And you?
- Everything all right.

1091
01:48:42,611 --> 01:48:46,377
The stage-hands that ar e concerned,
Fürst and Niklisch...

1092
01:48:47,248 --> 01:48:49,581
...ar e indispensable...

1093
01:48:52,354 --> 01:48:55,948
...and the loss of their services...

1094
01:48:56,558 --> 01:49:01,688
...would jeopardize the theater's
work. Date. Heil! Signatur e.

1095
01:49:06,867 --> 01:49:09,960
Germans!
Don't tolerate Nazi oppr ession.

1096
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,735
Embassy of the German Reich

1097
01:50:49,865 --> 01:50:53,858
Did you bring me anything fr om
Germany? A leather coat, at least?

1098
01:50:54,369 --> 01:50:55,802
- Leather coat?
- Y es.

1099
01:50:55,904 --> 01:51:02,035
lt's the fashion for men. Those who
took me to the fr ontier had them.

1100
01:51:07,415 --> 01:51:11,545
Y our eyes ar e so dead,
how do they look?

1101
01:51:12,153 --> 01:51:14,950
- Empty?
- No, dazed.

1102
01:51:15,056 --> 01:51:17,546
Y es, that's how l felt these past days.

1103
01:51:17,659 --> 01:51:20,354
Y ou see? Y ou wer e never like that.

1104
01:51:21,895 --> 01:51:26,026
l've thought a lot about you.
l believe l should be grateful.

1105
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:30,693
Without you, l'd be in a
concentration camp, or alr eady dead.

1106
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:36,870
lf you still like being with me,
then stay her e.

1107
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:40,772
l'll look after you. Y ou needn't
leave the house, not at first.

1108
01:51:40,881 --> 01:51:43,873
Then we'll find jobs. Y ou'r e so gifted.

1109
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:47,744
- l could have gone to America.
- Ther e you go.

1110
01:51:48,354 --> 01:51:51,448
l think l r eally was gifted.

1111
01:51:51,691 --> 01:51:53,682
But also a terrible coward.

1112
01:51:54,326 --> 01:51:58,855
What do l do elsewher e? Be an extra,
a stage-hand, a technician?

1113
01:52:00,231 --> 01:52:04,100
Do you think these hands
wer e made for manual labor?

1114
01:52:04,469 --> 01:52:07,461
l'll pr ovide for you.
What else do you want?

1115
01:52:08,506 --> 01:52:09,700
Success.

1116
01:52:09,808 --> 01:52:14,142
Hendrik Höf gen, just imagine...
you'd belong to me.

1117
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:19,979
Juliette, l have to go now.

1118
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:25,247
- Shall l see you again?
- l don't know.

1119
01:52:25,356 --> 01:52:30,622
- Can l see you off at the station?
- No, you don't fit into the pictur e.

1120
01:52:33,597 --> 01:52:37,259
All right, forget the station.
Just do what you want.

1121
01:52:37,935 --> 01:52:39,402
l do.

1122
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:42,861
That's why l'm her e.

1123
01:52:45,742 --> 01:52:49,838
Juliette, don't write anymor e.
lt's no good.

1124
01:53:33,988 --> 01:53:36,422
Ther e ar en't many people in this café.

1125
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:42,319
Would you pr efer to sit in the sun?
Y ou like that.

1126
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:46,058
No. Though l haven't had
much sunshine lately.

1127
01:53:49,369 --> 01:53:52,861
May l ask you something?
Do you still live alone?

1128
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,034
No, l've got friends. And you?

1129
01:53:56,776 --> 01:54:00,803
Friends... in times like these?
lt's difficult.

1130
01:54:02,115 --> 01:54:06,414
How can you still live in Berlin?
What keeps you ther e?

1131
01:54:06,518 --> 01:54:08,919
Barbara, l live in the theater.

1132
01:54:09,088 --> 01:54:10,953
And that is in Berlin?

1133
01:54:11,089 --> 01:54:14,923
l don't think you can judge
fr om Paris.

1134
01:54:18,864 --> 01:54:23,426
Y ou'r e mor e than an actor now.
Y ou took an oath. Y ou'r e a manager.

1135
01:54:23,669 --> 01:54:26,638
l didn't take the oath,
l just moved my lips.

1136
01:54:26,737 --> 01:54:30,139
Someone has to save our
values for a better world.

1137
01:54:30,275 --> 01:54:36,270
l'm playing Hamlet, whether those
in power like Shakespear e or not.

1138
01:54:36,614 --> 01:54:43,076
Shakespear e is their ornament to
pr ove ''we'r e not as bad as you think.''

1139
01:54:43,187 --> 01:54:44,916
Y ou can't stay in Berlin.

1140
01:54:45,055 --> 01:54:49,617
l have a family in Berlin.
Y ou know l'm married to the theater.

1141
01:54:49,993 --> 01:54:52,860
l can help people who ar e
having a hard time.

1142
01:54:52,963 --> 01:54:56,330
lf l leave, nothing better
will r eplace me.

1143
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:57,958
Words!

1144
01:54:58,969 --> 01:55:01,233
lt's always the same with you.

1145
01:55:01,338 --> 01:55:04,636
Y our method of self-deception
is still intact.

1146
01:55:05,442 --> 01:55:11,381
Don't you see? Whoever you save,
it's only a gestur e to your friends.

1147
01:55:11,714 --> 01:55:16,243
Y ou'r e in a show-case, legalizing
these people will be attached to you.

1148
01:55:16,385 --> 01:55:20,151
We can't choose when
and wher e we'r e born.

1149
01:55:20,456 --> 01:55:22,446
An entir e people can't emigrate.

1150
01:55:22,558 --> 01:55:27,791
As an actor l'm obliged to live in
my country, to observe and portray it.

1151
01:55:27,897 --> 01:55:32,095
And l can tell you, ther e ar e
decent people among them.

1152
01:55:32,467 --> 01:55:39,532
l hate coffee shop intellectuals and
l hate such r esistance-fighters, too.

1153
01:55:39,641 --> 01:55:45,546
The r eally valuable, such as theater
and art can rise above everything.

1154
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,607
That's my conviction.

1155
01:55:47,782 --> 01:55:50,215
Why did you want to meet me?

1156
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:54,311
Well, l don't r eally know why.

1157
01:55:58,058 --> 01:56:00,583
lt might even be danger ous for you.

1158
01:56:04,163 --> 01:56:07,691
Tell me, Barbara, did you ever...

1159
01:56:09,269 --> 01:56:10,861
... r eally love me?

1160
01:56:13,839 --> 01:56:20,176
Why did l come her e today? lf you'd
been listening, you wouldn't ask that.

1161
01:56:21,881 --> 01:56:25,408
lf you don't accept what's
happening in Germany...

1162
01:56:25,517 --> 01:56:27,452
...why do you still live ther e?

1163
01:56:27,587 --> 01:56:30,021
What does fr eedom mean for you?

1164
01:56:30,288 --> 01:56:34,783
Do you need it to live? Or do you just
need to be successful and loved?

1165
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:38,393
l'm satisfied with success.
lt means many love me.

1166
01:56:38,496 --> 01:56:41,294
And the fury of the envious
does me good.

1167
01:56:41,733 --> 01:56:46,329
Don't make me r esponsible
for the impotence of your friends.

1168
01:56:46,471 --> 01:56:49,497
- Mr. Höf gen.
- Mr. Davidson, this is a surprise.

1169
01:57:04,955 --> 01:57:07,583
The check, please.

1170
01:57:08,726 --> 01:57:10,283
Have l come too early?

1171
01:57:11,494 --> 01:57:12,860
Far ewell, Barbara.

1172
01:57:15,633 --> 01:57:16,997
May l pay?

1173
01:57:35,484 --> 01:57:37,214
What could l do her e?

1174
01:57:49,697 --> 01:57:51,063
Fr eedom...

1175
01:57:52,668 --> 01:57:53,861
What for?

1176
01:59:15,079 --> 01:59:16,671
Ober on and Titania.

1177
01:59:22,285 --> 01:59:23,752
Congratulations!

1178
01:59:25,256 --> 01:59:31,854
l gr eet our wonderful and truly
tantalizing German bride and gr oom.

1179
01:59:31,962 --> 01:59:35,557
Two young, yet matur e people...

1180
01:59:35,664 --> 01:59:40,124
...of pur est race and noblest blood,
who have enchanted us...

1181
01:59:40,237 --> 01:59:45,140
...and who serve our new society!

1182
01:59:51,814 --> 01:59:54,680
- Thank you.
- All the best.

1183
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:04,955
General, nice of you to come.

1184
02:00:05,393 --> 02:00:09,727
They can say what they want.
For me, the world is Grunewald.

1185
02:00:14,001 --> 02:00:19,337
I'll r emain a German artist and patriot,
no matter who may rule my land.

1186
02:00:19,473 --> 02:00:23,068
Grunewald is my favorite place...

1187
02:00:23,178 --> 02:00:26,408
...and what other country
br ews such good beer?

1188
02:00:26,514 --> 02:00:29,107
Casar, nice to see you.

1189
02:00:31,885 --> 02:00:36,845
Y ou can hold your r ehearsals
in this villa.

1190
02:00:38,425 --> 02:00:42,986
We'r e very pr oud of the way
you spoke in Paris.

1191
02:00:43,096 --> 02:00:48,398
The way you simply answer ed
all the questions...

1192
02:00:49,002 --> 02:00:53,734
...and said quite frankly and
honestly what it's like her e.

1193
02:02:04,841 --> 02:02:06,774
Carry on dancing.

1194
02:02:08,411 --> 02:02:09,434
Good evening.

1195
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:15,441
Now, that's a surprise !
l won't say no to that.

1196
02:02:26,728 --> 02:02:29,787
- Congratulations, my Mephisto.
- Thank you.

1197
02:02:29,898 --> 02:02:35,494
Now, as old Admiral Tirpitz said:
''Target sighted! Full speed ahead!''

1198
02:02:35,603 --> 02:02:38,800
l'm looking forward to
your Hamlet, my Mephisto.

1199
02:02:40,173 --> 02:02:45,134
Y our interview in Paris made a
good impr ession on all of us.

1200
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:51,849
Congratulations!
And lots of healthy German boys!

1201
02:02:52,218 --> 02:02:53,208
Thank you.

1202
02:02:56,756 --> 02:02:57,780
Madam?

1203
02:03:02,362 --> 02:03:03,454
Beautiful.

1204
02:03:10,103 --> 02:03:13,936
Y es, very much to my taste.

1205
02:03:27,919 --> 02:03:29,319
V ery lovely.

1206
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:33,357
Thank you, Madam.

1207
02:03:36,662 --> 02:03:37,685
Cheers!

1208
02:03:41,099 --> 02:03:43,590
We have no working hours, just work.

1209
02:03:44,569 --> 02:03:46,560
l'm sorry, l must go now.

1210
02:03:51,676 --> 02:03:55,270
Be happy together... Hamlet.

1211
02:06:01,899 --> 02:06:07,633
Lately l've been wondering whether
we actually deserve all this.

1212
02:06:08,372 --> 02:06:12,103
lf l'm forced to answer,
then l must say ''Y es.''

1213
02:06:12,209 --> 02:06:16,646
lf not we, who r epr esent
individuality and art...

1214
02:06:17,214 --> 02:06:22,207
...who else should, can and must rise
above all that happens in the world?

1215
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:26,652
That's why we'r e an ex ample
and encouragement to others.

1216
02:06:26,823 --> 02:06:29,519
No matter how filthy the world is...

1217
02:06:29,626 --> 02:06:34,996
...true art always r emains pur e
and true, doesn't it?

1218
02:06:35,098 --> 02:06:37,327
l'm married to the theater.

1219
02:06:38,401 --> 02:06:39,561
And so ar e you.

1220
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:46,030
l can't contact Otto Ulrichs.
l sent a messenger to his flat...

1221
02:06:46,141 --> 02:06:53,013
... but he was told that two men
took Ulrichs away two days ago.

1222
02:07:05,861 --> 02:07:10,354
Call the Prime Minister and
connect me with him.

1223
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:16,336
lf he's not ther e, ask for an
appointment as soon as possible.

1224
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:20,265
- Hello?
- Give it to me.

1225
02:07:21,809 --> 02:07:22,969
Höf gen.

1226
02:07:24,477 --> 02:07:28,504
- Hello.
- Do come in.

1227
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,050
- Hello.
- Do come in.

1228
02:07:49,168 --> 02:07:51,137
Well, what's going on?

1229
02:07:52,271 --> 02:07:55,798
Recently you helped me, on
behalf of a colleague.

1230
02:07:57,543 --> 02:07:59,670
Now l have to ask again for help.

1231
02:08:01,213 --> 02:08:02,509
The thing is...

1232
02:08:03,649 --> 02:08:10,747
...a few days ago, Otto Ulrichs
was taken fr om his apartment.

1233
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:15,951
- ls this why you've come?
- Y es, Ex cellency.

1234
02:08:16,327 --> 02:08:21,821
l'm fed up with you, Höf gen. These
matters ar e outside your jurisdiction.

1235
02:08:22,432 --> 02:08:25,266
Keep your nose out of this affair.

1236
02:08:25,737 --> 02:08:28,933
l'll give you some good advice :
Stop meddling.

1237
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:32,372
Y ou'd do better minding
your own business...

1238
02:08:32,476 --> 02:08:37,379
...so you won't get crushed
like a bug! Think you matter?

1239
02:08:38,649 --> 02:08:40,707
Ulrichs was involved in dirty work.

1240
02:08:40,817 --> 02:08:45,480
My State Theater manager ought
not show such inter est in a traitor.

1241
02:08:46,088 --> 02:08:47,113
Now go.

1242
02:08:47,624 --> 02:08:49,057
l told you to go.

1243
02:08:50,026 --> 02:08:52,153
Get out, actor!

1244
02:09:37,037 --> 02:09:41,235
l know how much l and the theater
owe to the General.

1245
02:09:41,342 --> 02:09:45,108
l also know that to a gr eat
extent we owe it to you.

1246
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:49,716
Dear Lotte, that's why l ask you
to intervene for Ulrichs.

1247
02:09:49,816 --> 02:09:54,116
- l'm so worried.
- Worried? But he's dead.

1248
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:59,148
Didn't you know? As far as l know,
he committed suicide.

1249
02:10:02,228 --> 02:10:03,455
Suicide.

1250
02:10:06,332 --> 02:10:10,358
He knew the risks he ran.
l think he's mor e to be envied.

1251
02:10:52,777 --> 02:10:58,271
The Prince of Denmark
r enounces rank, youth and love.

1252
02:10:58,415 --> 02:11:00,542
He is the savior of the North.

1253
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:06,611
The lonely knight with lofty ideals,
the ideal of purity of blood and race.

1254
02:11:06,723 --> 02:11:11,251
Hamlet is a complex character, too.
A gr eat and simple man.

1255
02:11:11,361 --> 02:11:16,127
Despite r epeating myself so soon:
He is a man of the North.

1256
02:11:16,331 --> 02:11:21,769
He kills. And in his
self-destructing battle...

1257
02:11:23,305 --> 02:11:25,364
... he shows us the way to the futur e.

1258
02:11:25,474 --> 02:11:30,036
He commands us to lead a pur e life.
That is his bequest to us today.

1259
02:11:30,144 --> 02:11:35,412
He is not weak, yet actors have
often portrayed him as neur otic...

1260
02:11:35,516 --> 02:11:40,544
...a pathological r evolutionary,
thus as a decadent type.

1261
02:11:40,655 --> 02:11:42,953
Hamlet is a hard man.

1262
02:11:43,057 --> 02:11:48,825
Y ou will see him as an
energetic, r esolute her o.

1263
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:55,059
He is also a hazard for the Germans.
We constantly analyze too much.

1264
02:11:55,169 --> 02:11:58,262
For the hour demands actions,
not only thoughts.

1265
02:11:58,372 --> 02:12:00,806
Least of all corruptive r eflection.

1266
02:12:01,242 --> 02:12:06,577
Hamlet is the tragic conflict
between action and inaction.

1267
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:10,773
Between hesitating,
thinking and doing.

1268
02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:15,848
And we, the bear ers
of German cultur e...

1269
02:12:16,056 --> 02:12:18,524
... know what to make of that.

1270
02:12:18,858 --> 02:12:21,089
Hamlet is a populist drama.

1271
02:12:21,193 --> 02:12:24,993
Neither r eligious,
aristocratic, nor bourgeois...

1272
02:12:25,097 --> 02:12:27,497
... but a work like the Gr eek tragedies.

1273
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:32,537
So we'll abolish the barrier
between audience and actor.

1274
02:12:33,038 --> 02:12:37,099
Space, light, movements,
sounds ar e everything...

1275
02:12:37,208 --> 02:12:42,111
...and even the spectators merge
into one gr eat, common effect.

1276
02:12:42,481 --> 02:12:45,211
We must bring about total theater.

1277
02:12:45,617 --> 02:12:49,849
A theater that shocks and mobilizes.

1278
02:13:58,119 --> 02:14:02,077
lt cost 60,000 marks to decorate
the theater for tonight...

1279
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:05,091
...and five days loss of takings.

1280
02:14:05,193 --> 02:14:09,288
A nice birthday party. And we have
to participate in this circus.

1281
02:14:09,397 --> 02:14:11,388
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1282
02:15:00,044 --> 02:15:03,537
The only place you will find a
party like this is in Berlin.

1283
02:15:22,366 --> 02:15:25,597
Dear est Bella,
we haven't met in ages.

1284
02:15:25,702 --> 02:15:28,296
Ar e you well? Not homesick?

1285
02:15:28,406 --> 02:15:33,502
l'm sur e you'r e fantastically well
and your gr eat son is flourishing.

1286
02:15:42,952 --> 02:15:46,251
Dear Höf gen, how ar e you?
How is the party going?

1287
02:15:46,488 --> 02:15:48,183
People seem to enjoy it.

1288
02:15:48,291 --> 02:15:52,784
Y our Hamlet was magnificent.
The boss was quite taken.

1289
02:15:52,895 --> 02:16:00,495
After the pr emier e he spoke
only of you and the theater.

1290
02:16:00,636 --> 02:16:04,231
Success is strange. Sometimes
you have it, sometimes not.

1291
02:16:04,338 --> 02:16:10,300
No, dear Höf gen, you give
people something, you cr eate.

1292
02:16:12,747 --> 02:16:13,907
Her e they come.

1293
02:17:44,868 --> 02:17:48,304
- How ar e you, Mephisto?
- V ery well, Y our Ex cellency.

1294
02:17:49,673 --> 02:17:53,073
l haven't told you, how wonderful
your Hamlet was.

1295
02:17:53,177 --> 02:17:56,111
l'm very glad.
Allow me to say a few words.

1296
02:17:57,314 --> 02:18:03,081
Mr. Prime Minister, Madam,
ladies and gentlemen.

1297
02:18:03,886 --> 02:18:11,156
We ar e pr oud to be able to celebrate
this day with you in this theater.

1298
02:18:11,394 --> 02:18:13,123
Since l have the honor...

1299
02:18:13,261 --> 02:18:16,128
...of gr eeting you on behalf
of everyone pr esent...

1300
02:18:16,232 --> 02:18:20,362
... l salute the statesman and soldier...

1301
02:18:20,468 --> 02:18:23,961
...friend and gener ous
patr on of the arts.

1302
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:28,935
We admir e him as our r ole model,
love him as our friend...

1303
02:18:29,076 --> 02:18:30,772
...obey him as our master...

1304
02:18:30,912 --> 02:18:35,076
...for without patr ons,
art is a bird with br oken wings.

1305
02:18:35,316 --> 02:18:39,047
As the poet says:
''May the gods pr otect you...

1306
02:18:39,154 --> 02:18:42,247
...and may the heart of Rome
beat for your aims.''

1307
02:18:50,129 --> 02:18:55,397
The Prime Minister wishes to
speak to you outside, in his car.

1308
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:57,232
Y ou alone.

1309
02:19:01,208 --> 02:19:04,142
Nicoletta will take you home.
l won't be long.

1310
02:20:00,764 --> 02:20:04,393
Well, Mephisto, what power is
looking down on you her e.

1311
02:20:04,801 --> 02:20:06,530
Do you feel it?

1312
02:20:07,371 --> 02:20:13,172
This is theater! Look at this ar ena.
lt's almost r eady. Wonderful, isn't it?

1313
02:20:13,944 --> 02:20:16,605
This is wher e
l'd stage a performance.

1314
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:21,677
Don't blink, Hendrik, look history
in the eye. What an echo.

1315
02:20:24,254 --> 02:20:26,619
Hendrik Höf gen!

1316
02:20:29,959 --> 02:20:34,623
We shall rule Eur ope and the world.
A thousand-year empir e.

1317
02:20:34,964 --> 02:20:37,762
Hendrik Höf gen!

1318
02:20:46,875 --> 02:20:49,435
Go ! Get going!

1319
02:20:53,214 --> 02:20:54,408
lnto the middle !

1320
02:21:12,834 --> 02:21:15,597
Well, how do you
enjoy this limelight?

1321
02:21:17,104 --> 02:21:19,265
This is the r eal light, isn't it?

1322
02:21:53,605 --> 02:21:56,802
What do they want of me? After all...

1323
02:21:57,609 --> 02:21:59,770
... l'm only an actor.
