1
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:26,779
I'll give my heart just to one man

2
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,750
The greatest love since time began

3
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:34,747
He'll come my way and he'll be strong

4
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:38,779
And he will sing me love's sweet song

5
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:40,710
- What happened, Mr. Höfgen?
- What do you want?

6
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,219
I don't need you now!
Go to hell!

7
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:04,912
We're invited to a boring banquet.
Sorry, but we have to leave now.

8
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:07,747
Can't you sit with us, Dora?

9
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,284
No, we're much too late.

10
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,250
Sorry, good evening.

11
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:15,148
I wanted to say you were
marvelous tonight.

12
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:18,414
It was fantastic. Thank God I saw it.

13
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:24,077
You fraud, you didn't see the show.
Never mind, you're talented.

14
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,618
Me? Talented? Say it louder.

15
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:31,018
Yes, you're very talented,
Herr Höfgen.

16
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:35,853
I'm sure you'll soon be able to show
just how talented you are.

17
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:38,348
I must be going, goodbye.

18
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:53,542
- Böck. Seven marks.
- But Hendrik...

19
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,084
...if you need money
I can lend you fifty marks.

20
00:05:57,354 --> 00:06:01,117
This is men's business.
Böck likes giving money.

21
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:06,245
Good evening, Miklas.
Thank you.

22
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:07,642
So...

23
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,776
...Doctor Kroge lets me starve.

24
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:18,852
Höfgen, you old sinner!
Take a seat.

25
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:21,216
Well, Director,
how'd you like the show?

26
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,683
What's getting you down, Hendrik?

27
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,314
That I'm a provincial actor.

28
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:37,843
Is that all? Nothing else?

29
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,580
Hello.

30
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:08,011
You're late.

31
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,217
One day, I'll come to fetch you.

32
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,609
Don't you dread that, Heinz?

33
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:19,415
- Please don't call me Heinz.
- Why not? That's your name.

34
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:22,346
I dislike it. Understand?

35
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:25,883
Perfectly, Heinz.

36
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:30,919
You can't even drink a beer like
a man who feels like drinking one.

37
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,008
Shall we start?

38
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:34,279
What was that about beer?

39
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,345
It's not your style,
simply to call for a beer.

40
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:43,783
"A beer, please" sounds
phony when you say it.

41
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,951
I don't drink, Juliette.

42
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:49,143
I know, Heinz. Take your shoes off.

43
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,250
Come on...

44
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,811
One, two...

45
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,810
One, two...

46
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,543
...one, two, three, four...

47
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:03,847
On one...

48
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,381
Don't fall down now.

49
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:50,911
Faster!

50
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:55,276
Faster!
Show me what you can do.

51
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,876
You want to be an actor
and show off for money, too?

52
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:04,585
You comical picture of misery.

53
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,411
If you liked this music,
you wouldn't get tired.

54
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,043
You always laugh at me, Juliette.

55
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,884
I can't cry. Would you
love me if I could cry?

56
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:36,817
I love you anyway.

57
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:40,819
You only love yourself, Heinz,
and even then not enough.

58
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:45,018
Keep talking.
What you say is very nice.

59
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,984
Your only concern is your face
being devoid of human expression.

60
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,709
It's a mask, you hear?

61
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,651
I, too, have skin and bones
and body weight...

62
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:03,083
...and eyebrows and fingernails,
just like you.

63
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:10,851
I, too, feel the cold.
I can be hungry and thirsty.

64
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:12,715
I, too, think of my mother.

65
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:16,480
And I know there are
Philistines and Communists.

66
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:20,880
But my eyes are not my eyes.

67
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,811
My legs are not mine,
my face is not mine.

68
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:33,180
My name is not my name,
because I am an actor!

69
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,780
Do you know what it
means to be an actor?

70
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:42,585
An actor is a mask...

71
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,409
...among human beings.

72
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,812
Juliette...

73
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:05,317
Juliette...

74
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,645
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have the honor...

75
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:04,414
...of welcoming you to
the first reading of the play.

76
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:10,682
May I introduce our guest,
Nicoletta von Niebuhr...

77
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:14,808
...who will play the female
lead in this production.

78
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:25,145
Do you mind if my friend
watches the rehearsal?

79
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,883
I have no objection.

80
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:32,817
- Two cognacs, please.
- Yes, director.

81
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:36,286
Coming up right away.

82
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:37,976
Three beers, please.

83
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,509
There you go.

84
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,279
Please excuse me.

85
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,212
Please excuse me.

86
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,117
Father Hansemann...

87
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,743
Hendrik, will we look
lovely in this play?

88
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:56,945
We are lovely.

89
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,610
May I introduce my best friend,
Barbara Bruckner?

90
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:02,050
Nice to meet you.

91
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:03,475
What?

92
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:06,246
There's a nice smell of
lavender about you.

93
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,943
Can you smell the lavender, too?

94
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:13,847
How shocking, on a man.
But I need it like my daily bread.

95
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,216
A little on the temples is
as good as a night's sleep.

96
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,184
Sleep would be better,
but there's no time.

97
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,952
A beer and a mineral water.

98
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,676
We'll hear what he has to say...

99
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:31,719
...use the good bits,
then play it our way.

100
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,715
He's good, but old-fashioned.

101
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:37,786
The future of Hamburg
Art Theater is me.

102
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,852
I mean the two of us.

103
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:47,551
Most of the plays here
are shallow bourgeois stuff.

104
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,851
But we visualize theater
that will involve everyone...

105
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:54,249
...the workers, the dockers.

106
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:56,909
Where will you perform this theater?

107
00:14:57,153 --> 00:15:00,745
It doesn't matter.
In the docks, factories, cellars.

108
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:04,286
They asked me about the play.
We promised it for last week.

109
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:07,319
Let's get this opening night over first.

110
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:12,210
We must prove that theater
has a political function.

111
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:17,582
Before it can be political or
revolutionary, it first has to be good.

112
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:20,209
Which actors will be in
this sort of theater?

113
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:23,514
All who think like us. Even workers.

114
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,780
It's what we say, not how we say it.

115
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:30,876
But I've no qualms if
Hendrik stages our plays.

116
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:35,016
Go on. Why are you looking at me?

117
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:37,386
Am I not allowed to?

118
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:40,147
If it pleases you, go ahead.

119
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,947
Without you, I'll be finished, Barbara.

120
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,684
There's too much evil in me.

121
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:50,544
Alone, I'm too weak to overcome it,
but you could help me.

122
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:58,814
I can't talk anymore. So many
thoughts are just parts I've played.

123
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,914
I love you, Barbara.

124
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:31,020
I'm in love. With a woman.

125
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:36,051
Juliette, am I a good looking man?

126
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,548
I've never seen you on stage.
Maybe you're handsome, but...

127
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:44,880
...frankly, I've never found
you good looking, but...

128
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,317
...sometimes your cold cheating eyes
are those of a sad child.

129
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,249
You do it well.

130
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:57,314
Who have you fallen for?

131
00:17:57,686 --> 00:18:00,209
- A girl.
- Great.

132
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:02,682
You falling in love...

133
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:06,412
One day you may just learn
how to walk, not just dance.

134
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:12,050
Love the girl, Heinz, and don't
tell me anything about her.

135
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:17,779
- Do we keep in touch?
- Yes.

136
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:21,915
You know what? I'm coming with you.

137
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,676
I have nothing to lose, Heinz.

138
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,515
Are you crazy?

139
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,881
See a psychiatrist.

140
00:18:57,654 --> 00:19:00,950
Though I'm sure you wouldn't
dare talk about yourself.

141
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:06,449
Go, Heinz. We'll meet soon anyway...

142
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,076
...even if I don't want to.

143
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:13,318
Grandmother, have you a moment?

144
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:19,647
- I'd like to introduce...
- Your fiancé.

145
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:23,151
I have to take a closer look
at my new grandson.

146
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:30,250
Not bad at all.

147
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:37,444
Excuse my mother please,
she will be here shortly.

148
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:40,978
I assume you know,
my dear Höfgen...

149
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:48,083
...that loving mothers rarely want
their only sons to leave the nest.

150
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,083
Hello, Sebastian.

151
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:55,879
That is Sebastian.

152
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:04,712
Mom.

153
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:14,478
I'm really pleased.

154
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:16,647
Barbara, my dear child.

155
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:19,543
And I'm Nicoletta von Niebuhr...

156
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:23,177
...the bride's best friend,
almost her sister.

157
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:30,311
Often, the bridegroom's mistress.
Only on stage, of course.

158
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,181
May I call you Aunt Bella?

159
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:35,651
But of course, Nicoletta.

160
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:45,312
Let us leave the ladies to themselves.

161
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,150
I'd like to show you my garden.

162
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:52,220
I'd love to see it.

163
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:58,215
Have you unsettling memories, too?

164
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,446
You know, Barbara,
memories that give you the creeps?

165
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:12,080
When I was about twelve,
I got into our school choir.

166
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:18,551
I was overjoyed. I thought I could
sing better than the other boys.

167
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:22,946
We had to sing in church
at some wedding.

168
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:31,610
I wanted to show off.
I was so proud of my soprano voice.

169
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:35,948
I had a great idea. I sang
one octave higher than the others.

170
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:39,120
As I stood there, proudly singing...

171
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:45,176
...the music teacher looked at me
more in disgust than disapproval...

172
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:48,220
...and he said softly,
"Just keep quiet".

173
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,008
Do you understand?

174
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:54,747
Softly and dryly he said,
"Just keep quiet".

175
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:58,251
When I felt I was singing
like an angel.

176
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,020
Do you have such memories?

177
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:04,175
No.

178
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:10,015
You've never felt
ashamed in your life.

179
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:13,280
I often have. That was the first time.

180
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:18,378
I often have to feel awfully
ashamed of myself.

181
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:22,650
So ashamed,
I could sink down into hell.

182
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,612
Do you understand me?

183
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:32,250
This is the basement room.
The window faces the street.

184
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:37,513
Here's a lamp post and here, too.
Behind it the bakery...

185
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,484
- ...with workers' wives lined up.
- Stop!

186
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,445
Great.

187
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:47,779
Ms. Schult, you come up
past the window.

188
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:51,182
Barbara, can you put a
lamp post here...

189
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,013
...with a light to dazzle the audience?

190
00:23:55,153 --> 00:24:00,710
Then you come here. "I'm Widow
Queck who hasn't paid the rent".

191
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:06,651
We could have several more
lamp posts in the auditorium...

192
00:24:06,754 --> 00:24:11,685
...so people feel they're
really in their filthy street.

193
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:17,651
We'll have posters, recent political
slogans, all jumbled up.

194
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:23,751
At the back, a grocer's shop,
with nothing to sell, of course.

195
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:28,183
Everything in the hall must
express what we talk about.

196
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:33,650
Two policemen can patrol the rows
and stare at the audience.

197
00:24:33,754 --> 00:24:39,186
An end to passive watching, actors
and public isolated from each other.

198
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:45,277
The public must play an active part.
The days of the peepshow are over.

199
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:48,910
The actor is only one element
of the performance...

200
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,952
...not it's focal point.

201
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:57,213
The hall, lights, walls, movements,
sounds, all must blend into a whole.

202
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,947
Only then shall we have real theater.
The workers need total theater.

203
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:06,577
One that shocks and arouses.

204
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:13,743
I am the widow Queck, who cannot
pay the rent. I work for the baker.

205
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:17,284
It's the only way I can feed
my seven hungry children.

206
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:20,319
The half-hour has to be paid for.

207
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,409
We've been waiting half an hour.

208
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,418
Here reigns logic and hunger.

209
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:31,510
I already owe you 31 marks
and 25 pfennigs.

210
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:35,551
I've had nothing these past few days.

211
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:38,610
Silly goose!

212
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:42,642
Sabotaging our work!
Do you think I don't know why?

213
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:47,913
Miklas or one of his damn party
friends has put you up to it!

214
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:51,646
- What do you want from me?
- Why don't you prompt her?!

215
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:58,677
Never mind! Revolutionary Theatre
can't be staged with provincial hams.

216
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:02,412
With amateurs, you can't
create any sort of theatre.

217
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,952
Even revolutions need professionals!

218
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:14,382
I'll buy you a drink to celebrate.
Revolutionary Theater is a big flop.

219
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:17,385
You're beside yourself with joy.

220
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:23,610
Hello.

221
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:25,919
Two stiff ones, Hansemann.

222
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:34,081
How about another
rebellious evening?

223
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,918
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

224
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:41,811
What, me?

225
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,550
- Good morning.
- Morning.

226
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:49,447
You're still half asleep.

227
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:51,348
I'm awake.

228
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,453
I've even phoned our grocer, he's
a bit impatient over our large bill.

229
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:04,085
I'm sorry. I don't present a picture
of early morning freshness.

230
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:11,077
If I, too, went riding every morning
I'd probably look more attractive.

231
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:15,550
But in our circles,
such noble sport is not customary.

232
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:19,108
The offended husband, as in Molière.

233
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,981
Oh, be quiet.

234
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:27,978
It's not customary to sit all night
at a Nazi thug's table.

235
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:32,143
- Miklas is not a thug.
- All Nazis are thugs.

236
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:38,285
You must a void their company.
Their dirt rubs off on you.

237
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:45,116
But you can't understand. It's your
family's well known liberalism.

238
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:51,312
No political beliefs, just curiosity.
Ideologies are psychological quirks.

239
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,680
I feel sorry for Miklas. He gets
small parts and earns very little.

240
00:27:55,786 --> 00:28:01,447
You all treat him very badly. He's
at a loss, that's why he's with them.

241
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:05,581
So much understanding
for that lousy brat.

242
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:09,142
How do you think they'd treat us
if they came to power?

243
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:11,412
God forbid.

244
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,248
And yet you sit and chat with him.
It's you bourgeois tolerance.

245
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:19,946
This understanding of one's enemy.

246
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:24,918
I'm sure you could even
excuse Fascist terrorism.

247
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:29,147
Your liberalism might even
get used to dictatorship.

248
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:30,879
No, thank you.

249
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:33,117
May I remark...

250
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,676
...it's common practice to eat an egg
from its shell and with salt.

251
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:41,912
I know, in the Bruckner household
you eat it from a glass...

252
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:45,009
...with six spices,
and that's very original...

253
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:50,747
...but no need to make fun of those
unaccustomed to such originality.

254
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:08,947
- Who's juvenile lead in Halberstadt?
- Herbert Boltz.

255
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:11,416
Where's
Ms. Türkheim-Gawernitz now?

256
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,712
In Heidelberg.

257
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:15,286
- And Hannelore Kühn.
- Mannheim.

258
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,284
- And who's Othello there?
- Max Krause.

259
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:20,580
- And Iago?
- Johannes Fiedler.

260
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,550
- And Desdemona in Leipzig?
- Käthe Müttel.

261
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:25,381
Who's the ingénue in Jena?

262
00:29:25,487 --> 00:29:28,248
A stupid cow called Lotte Lindenthal.

263
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:32,643
Why is Lotte Lindenthal a stupid cow?

264
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,853
I don't know, but she is.

265
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:37,852
I know why you insult her.

266
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:41,511
She's the friend of
a National Socialist leader.

267
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:47,781
I'm only moderately interested
in the names and titles of her lovers.

268
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,616
Must be quite a long list...

269
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:53,482
Watch your tongue, Höfgen!

270
00:29:55,554 --> 00:30:02,077
You won't insult a lady because she's
in the Nazi German worker's party...

271
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:05,582
...and the friend of a German hero.

272
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:08,276
You won't stand for it?

273
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,283
My, my...

274
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:15,148
Stop it, you're drunk.

275
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:20,312
I'm not. On the contrary.

276
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,211
Apparently I'm the only one here
with a spark of honor left.

277
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,377
Nobody in this Jew-ridden business
cares if a lady is insulted.

278
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,416
Let me!

279
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,608
No!

280
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:37,950
Go away!

281
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:43,848
I'll gladly believe you're not drunk.

282
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:48,083
You won't make that an excuse, then.

283
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:51,153
As for this Jew-ridden
business you're in...

284
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,617
...you won't suffer it much longer.

285
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,650
That I promise you.

286
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,781
Perhaps you're right.

287
00:31:00,586 --> 00:31:04,145
I agree, the fellow's behavior
was intolerable...

288
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:08,447
...but I can't just fire a poor,
sick man like that.

289
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:11,109
Sick? He's not sick at all.

290
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:17,150
Why this indecision and compromise?
It's just like our government parties.

291
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:19,744
Excuse me, Barbara.

292
00:31:19,854 --> 00:31:23,843
We must show this murderous
pack it can't get away with it.

293
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:27,351
I beg you, don't insist that
he be sacked on the spot.

294
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:32,443
It's punishment enough that he
won't be hired for next season.

295
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:36,781
He has no idea what he said
last night, he just went wild.

296
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:38,477
I'm amazed, Otto.

297
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:44,812
I'm really amazed that you,
of all people, should say that.

298
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:48,444
I don't want him made a martyr.

299
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:52,676
- In the political situation...
- Excuse me if I interrupt.

300
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:58,515
This conversation is quite pointless.
The case is simple.

301
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,348
Either Miklas leaves the theater...

302
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:05,885
...or I do.

303
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:07,884
That's nonsense.

304
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:12,681
Higher, higher!

305
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:05,379
Higher, higher!

306
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,883
Enough! This isn't a funeral march!

307
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,317
Again.

308
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:18,380
Lights!

309
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,650
Sorry, to interrupt.

310
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:01,016
Dr. Kroge asks you to
approve the next poster.

311
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:03,813
I must take it to the printer.

312
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,810
Can't I get my name spelled
correctly even in this theatre?

313
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:15,515
My name is not Henrik, but Hendrik!

314
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:19,912
Hendrik Höfgen.

315
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,946
One day they'll all
have to mark my name.

316
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:29,812
Try to understand, doctor.
I can't and won't tie myself down.

317
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:34,285
It's a great strain
to stay under contract.

318
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:36,285
I must be free. Free.

319
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:40,745
I can't be a provincial matinee idol.

320
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,579
No, no, I don't want to be that.

321
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:46,619
You want to leave Hamburg for good?

322
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:48,879
I don't know yet.

323
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:59,444
The Professor invited me to a Berlin
guest appearance. One never knows.

324
00:35:00,187 --> 00:35:02,517
By the way, Dora Martin
will be my partner.

325
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:06,548
Good. Then accept the offer.

326
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:09,575
Thank you.

327
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:14,012
Berlin.

328
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:21,447
Thank you, ladies. Till tomorrow.

329
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,952
Goodbye.

330
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,617
So you are Höfgen.

331
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:33,945
You have friends here.

332
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:38,247
Some of them, who understand
theater, recommended you to me.

333
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:45,445
Your father-in-law, too,
when we met at the ministry.

334
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,382
And Dora Martin, as well.

335
00:36:56,721 --> 00:37:02,676
In real life I may seem a bit
nondescript, but not, I hope on stage.

336
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:09,110
My father-in-law once aptly described
my ability to transform myself.

337
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:16,050
Well, we'll give you a try.

338
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,884
Don't expect too much.
I'm not offering anything big.

339
00:37:24,986 --> 00:37:31,147
You are probably used to a
reasonable income in Hamburg.

340
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:36,016
Here you'll have less.
Have you expensive tastes?

341
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,879
Money doesn't interest me.
My needs are modest.

342
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:47,313
All I need every day is a clean shirt
and a drop of cologne.

343
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:52,185
Discuss the details with
Miss Bernhardt.

344
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:56,151
Please give my regards
to your father-in-law.

345
00:37:57,754 --> 00:38:00,413
- Hendrik Höfgen.
- Oh, yes. Bernhardt.

346
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:02,546
Here's your contract.

347
00:38:02,754 --> 00:38:03,810
Thank you.

348
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:06,912
- May I?
- Please.

349
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:17,281
700 marks a month, less tax.
You agree to play as cast.

350
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,244
Please give these flowers...

351
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:36,214
...and this card to Ms. Martin, will you?

352
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:40,581
THANKS!

353
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,648
Well, Hendrik Höfgen.

354
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:05,546
Now you're a beginner again.

355
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:10,713
Hamburg's fame, routine and
security all lie behind you.

356
00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:16,250
Now you must summon
up all your strength.

357
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:28,442
And we'll work off that blubber.

358
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:00,850
- Who is that?
- Dora Martin's Hamburg actor lover.

359
00:41:00,953 --> 00:41:04,681
- No, Miss Bernhardt's.
- You're misinformed, dear.

360
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:09,981
So glad you were able to come,
despite all your work.

361
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,046
May I introduce some
of your admirers?

362
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:18,518
Mr. Davidson of the London Times.
Cäser von Muck, Mr. Müller-Andreä.

363
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:38,752
Mind you aren't influenced by
the prevailing culture Bolshevism.

364
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:40,444
What do you mean?

365
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:46,220
German culture can only be renewed
if it returns to its national roots...

366
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,752
...to its essence of blood and soil.

367
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:54,878
Russian ravings or French farces are
alien to the spirit the nation needs.

368
00:42:15,454 --> 00:42:17,283
Have you met Mr. Höfgen?

369
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:21,717
Berlin's new star, according to
tomorrow's London Times.

370
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:24,809
I've seen you on stage.
You danced, didn't you?

371
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:29,580
Yes, I like dancing.
I had a good teacher.

372
00:42:29,854 --> 00:42:32,547
I'd like to model your head.

373
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,976
No neck-tie and no gold we've got
We're just a very shabby lot

374
00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:45,910
At which the bourgeois spits

375
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:50,479
The bourgeois with polished boots
And medals on morning suits

376
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:55,712
And every morning he ablutes
for church, or for the Ritz

377
00:42:57,686 --> 00:43:03,245
Where does the bourgeois get it all?
His guns his celebration ball?

378
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:06,180
He steals it where he can

379
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:10,709
He makes it hard for us to rob
Takes it all, the greedy slob

380
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:15,719
Exploits the poor and wrecks the job
of every working man

381
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:24,047
Oh, if so wealthy I could be,
Commit like him grand larceny

382
00:43:24,153 --> 00:43:26,983
All honored since my birth

383
00:43:27,253 --> 00:43:33,152
If then I met someone I knew,
You filthy lot, I'd spit at you

384
00:43:33,253 --> 00:43:39,118
That's all you dogs are worth!

385
00:43:45,253 --> 00:43:48,276
Get the Jews out of here!

386
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,782
They are completely drunk.

387
00:44:05,886 --> 00:44:10,512
Now one of the most famous
State Theater actors, Hendrik Höfgen.

388
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:19,509
Forget State Theater and fame.
I am your comrade Hendrik Höfgen.

389
00:44:22,754 --> 00:44:29,209
What does the proletariat want?
That nobody should rule!

390
00:44:29,554 --> 00:44:35,851
What does the proletariat want?
That nobody should rule!

391
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:41,486
Nobody shall give orders
Nobody shall be a slave

392
00:44:41,686 --> 00:44:46,619
Freedom, equality for all souls

393
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,885
I'll dictate. Headline:

394
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:56,616
Actor Höfgen wins
Berlin workers' hearts overnight.

395
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:58,513
New paragraph.

396
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:01,946
- Hendrik?
- Hello.

397
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:09,447
I bought this picture at the
antique dealer. You don't mind?

398
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:11,280
Why should I mind?

399
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:14,578
You can admire it
while I go and change.

400
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:55,476
I love you, Barbara. Not only
your father and grandmother.

401
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:58,552
I love you... I, Hendrik Höfgen.

402
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:17,048
Welcome to my home,
dear Sebastian.

403
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:20,149
The theater awaits me.

404
00:46:20,253 --> 00:46:24,845
Up!

405
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:33,883
Up!

406
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:35,778
Two!

407
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,545
Three!

408
00:47:38,153 --> 00:47:39,245
Four!

409
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:40,844
Five!

410
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:42,044
Six!

411
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:46,310
Führer!
We are our people's strength!

412
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,181
We shall create a new world!

413
00:47:49,354 --> 00:47:52,149
- What's your father's job?
- Road digger!

414
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,220
- And your father's?
- Farmer!

415
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,616
- And yours?
- Teacher. He educates us!

416
00:47:57,721 --> 00:48:01,312
- And your father?
- Baker. He bakes our bread!

417
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,046
Mine's a miller. He grinds our grain!

418
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:06,210
A doctor. He makes us healthy!

419
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,377
Bricklayer. He builds our houses!

420
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:10,317
- Conductor!
- Electrician!

421
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,682
We are the sons of one people,
we all have the same goal!

422
00:48:14,786 --> 00:48:17,617
Unity and strength!
We follow the Führer!

423
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:24,881
No. That's not convincing enough.
Say it like this...

424
00:48:25,021 --> 00:48:27,884
- Again... one, two, three.
- Unity and strength!

425
00:48:27,986 --> 00:48:31,317
- Again... one, two, three.
- Unity and strength!

426
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,477
Again!

427
00:48:32,586 --> 00:48:34,519
Unity and strength!

428
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,585
- Louder! Again!
- Unity and strength!

429
00:48:37,786 --> 00:48:39,082
We follow the Führer!

430
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:44,643
Blood is a very special juice...

431
00:48:46,854 --> 00:48:52,582
...let us in depths of sensuousness
assuage our burning passions.

432
00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:56,017
No bounds and goals are set for you.

433
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:59,917
You find your pleasure.
A fleeing treasure.

434
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:06,008
May you enjoy the prize you get.
Help yourself and don't be coy.

435
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:08,678
But listen, it's not a question of joy.

436
00:49:08,786 --> 00:49:12,242
To knowledge I'm devoted,
most painful gratification.

437
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:15,286
Most hateful love,
most vexing stimulation.

438
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:21,979
Believe me, who countless years
on this hard nourishment has fed.

439
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:28,281
That from cradle to the grave, no
human can digest so stale a bread.

440
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:32,716
Believe me, worlds
celestial and infernal...

441
00:49:32,821 --> 00:49:35,651
...for one divinity were made.

442
00:49:35,754 --> 00:49:38,878
He exists in eternal light.

443
00:49:38,986 --> 00:49:44,283
But us, into the darkness, has
conveyed there's day and night alone.

444
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:45,648
Yet I want that!

445
00:49:46,786 --> 00:49:51,049
That's well worth hearing.
But there's one thing I fear.

446
00:49:51,153 --> 00:49:54,018
For time is short, but art is long.

447
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:58,849
If I thought you sought more teaching,
cultivate a poet fond of preaching.

448
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:01,111
Let his thoughts wander.

449
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,778
And every noble quality upon
your brow let him bestow...

450
00:50:04,886 --> 00:50:07,546
...the lion's courage,
the buck's swiftness.

451
00:50:07,654 --> 00:50:10,779
The Italian's fiery blood,
the north's enduring pluck.

452
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:15,012
He'll teach you the secret vile
of magnanimity steeped in guile.

453
00:50:15,153 --> 00:50:20,018
May his youthful drives uncover
to make of you an ardent lover.

454
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:28,451
I'd like to meet a scholar of such fame
to Microcosm I'd change his name.

455
00:50:28,986 --> 00:50:34,749
So what am I, if it's not possible
the paragon of humanity to attain...

456
00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:36,877
...towards all my senses strain?

457
00:50:36,986 --> 00:50:41,419
You're in the end just what you are.

458
00:50:42,053 --> 00:50:45,486
Put on the wigs of a million curls.

459
00:50:45,986 --> 00:50:50,180
Put your feet in elevating socks.

460
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:55,486
You'll stay forever what you are!

461
00:51:18,053 --> 00:51:19,485
Bravo!

462
00:51:25,854 --> 00:51:28,843
Wonderful!
You were fantastic, Hendrik.

463
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:32,612
You were born to play Mephisto.

464
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:36,278
You say that with a
touch of malice, Dora.

465
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:39,444
Not true, I don't detest
people for what they are.

466
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:43,646
- Anyway, thank you for coming.
- Let's skip the clichés.

467
00:51:43,886 --> 00:51:47,342
- What's your next project?
- I'm learning English.

468
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:49,318
English? Why?

469
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,443
- I'll be working in America.
- But why?

470
00:51:53,654 --> 00:51:56,950
Here the curtain's descending.
Haven't you noticed?

471
00:51:57,053 --> 00:52:03,317
You're at the top here, hit after hit.
Thousands adore you. So why go?

472
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,375
Thousands! Soon they'll be
raving about others.

473
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:13,220
There'll always be theater,
no matter what happens in Germany.

474
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,044
No matter what happens in Germany?
You really mean that?

475
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,312
Well, all the best.
I'm leaving in a few days.

476
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:27,843
In a few days?

477
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:30,476
I don't want to wait till it's too late.

478
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:33,652
But you'll always do well, Hendrik...

479
00:52:33,886 --> 00:52:36,682
...no matter what happens
in Germany.

480
00:52:46,187 --> 00:52:47,448
It's open.

481
00:52:48,854 --> 00:52:55,911
Mephisto, I never lock the door.
Need neither bolts nor life insurance.

482
00:52:56,053 --> 00:53:00,179
- I bet you've taken one out.
- I need no life insurance.

483
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,549
Sit down, sir, in my new home.

484
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:06,946
You could have
gotten me a nicer flat.

485
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:11,747
- Have you registered with the police?
- Yes, sir.

486
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:14,614
What did the landlord say?

487
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:18,914
Nothing. He was drunk,
humming a song...

488
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:21,543
No neck-ties, no gold we've got...

489
00:53:21,654 --> 00:53:25,416
He gave me the key and I moved in.

490
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:33,518
I've been longing to see you.

491
00:53:34,654 --> 00:53:39,711
- And how's your wife?
- She's with her father, thank God.

492
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,719
They're worried about the Republic.

493
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:58,117
In Hamburg, the foreigners were also
very worried about Germany...

494
00:53:58,354 --> 00:54:02,809
...about German culture,
whose Number-One-Parrot you are.

495
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:07,717
As if a peril threatened it. What are
the Jews planning against Germany?

496
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:10,252
Even the whores wonder...

497
00:54:10,354 --> 00:54:14,513
...and they don't care about
the pant color as long as it has a fly.

498
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:18,451
Barbara understands politics,
doesn't she?

499
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:20,910
Is she keeping an eye on you?

500
00:54:21,886 --> 00:54:26,784
No. Mostly her opinions
are the opposite of mine.

501
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:31,114
- Have you told her so?
- No. What point would there be?

502
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:34,178
Words don't say everything.

503
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,611
I'd like very much to sleep with you.

504
00:54:41,886 --> 00:54:44,217
Shall I make up the bed?

505
00:54:45,087 --> 00:54:46,075
Yes!

506
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:52,319
Hendrik! Hendrik!

507
00:54:54,886 --> 00:54:57,819
Hendrik, wake up! Didn't you here?

508
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,181
You're here already?

509
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,843
I came on the early train,
because of you.

510
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:06,351
- What's the matter?
- When did you go to bed?

511
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,245
I'm tired. I was tossing all night.
Why?

512
00:55:10,354 --> 00:55:14,219
The Nazis have won the elections.
You know who became Chancellor?

513
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,377
No.

514
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:22,083
Do you hear that?

515
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,080
Do you hear that?

516
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:33,153
That Bohemian corporal has
become Chancellor?

517
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:34,617
Here, read it.

518
00:55:34,786 --> 00:55:39,049
I thought there was nothing
to fear from the Nazis.

519
00:55:40,821 --> 00:55:44,082
Remember that business with Miklas?

520
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:51,920
That could have unpleasant
consequences. What do we do now?

521
00:55:53,953 --> 00:55:58,409
Keep a clear head and don't panic.

522
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:04,442
So, the Austrian clown has
become Reichs-Chancellor.

523
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:10,878
But there still is the opposition, no?
Communists and Social Democrats.

524
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,452
They'll make sure he doesn't
get too big for his boots.

525
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:19,481
Perhaps there'll even
be armed resistance.

526
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:28,209
And even if the Nazis stay in power,
why should it concern me?

527
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,843
I'm from the Rhineland.

528
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:34,147
So are my parents.
What can happen to us?

529
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:37,684
On top of that, I'm an actor. No?

530
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:44,415
I go to the theater, play my parts,
then go back home. That's all.

531
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,952
Some people are leaving a country...

532
00:56:48,053 --> 00:56:51,918
...where a career in the arts
is now impossible.

533
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,611
People will think you don't care
about anything beyond the limelight?

534
00:56:56,721 --> 00:57:01,551
There were elections in a democratic
state. One party won, that's all.

535
00:57:01,654 --> 00:57:06,609
I've never been interested
in politics, so why now?

536
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:09,878
Don't you realize
what's happening here?

537
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:17,780
Don't answer it. I'm not here,
I'm sick. Say what you want.

538
00:57:20,554 --> 00:57:24,919
Is that any solution? To lock
yourself in, to hide, not be at home?

539
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:30,611
Is that all you can think of,
instead of taking a definite stand?

540
00:57:30,754 --> 00:57:35,379
Definite... this is my answer!
Hamlet! Shakespeare!

541
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,442
Either we take a stand or go,
if our freedom is in danger.

542
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:43,610
This is the only form of freedom
for me, for an actor.

543
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:47,378
You can't hide behind Shakespeare,
on the stage.

544
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:52,885
Barbara, I'm an actor.
An actor in Germany at all times.

545
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:55,952
You can go away.
Your father is a famous writer.

546
00:57:56,053 --> 00:57:59,645
You can design sets anywhere,
or buy antiques.

547
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:02,685
But I need the German language!

548
00:58:02,786 --> 00:58:06,947
I need the motherland, don't you see?

549
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:27,514
- Who's there?
- Otto.

550
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,176
- Who?
- Otto.

551
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:34,082
- I must talk to you.
- You want some coffee?

552
00:58:34,187 --> 00:58:35,847
- No, thanks.
- Tea?

553
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:41,046
Act with us again. It's the only reply
we can give to these events.

554
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:45,143
An appearance by all of us,
a common front.

555
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:47,651
So we don't lose our future.

556
00:58:47,754 --> 00:58:52,879
You just want to divide the audience?
We must work out our tactics.

557
00:58:52,986 --> 00:58:55,578
Tactics will force us to our knees.

558
00:58:55,686 --> 00:58:58,676
We must fight this
crushing demagogy.

559
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:05,810
It's our job to tell the hesitators:
Now is the time to resist dictatorship!

560
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:07,886
Otto, in the first place, we're actors...

561
00:59:07,986 --> 00:59:11,111
No, not a protest on the street.
I'm talking about the stage.

562
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,048
Still, I think we should
wait a few days.

563
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:16,709
We must do something
immediately. Tonight.

564
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:23,546
Otto, I'd rather stay
with the reserves.

565
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:34,713
Thank God
I've no performance today.

566
00:59:44,021 --> 00:59:45,077
GERMAN REICHS-MAIL

567
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:55,977
Film contract, locations in Budapest...

568
00:59:57,153 --> 01:00:01,710
...leading role.
Production Manager Altenburger.

569
01:00:08,586 --> 01:00:12,576
She really is a beauty.
She's sitting by the side altar.

570
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:16,676
Cut! Very good!
The second one.

571
01:00:17,287 --> 01:00:23,810
Now the scene where they follow her
to the Fishermen's Bastion.

572
01:00:34,754 --> 01:00:36,220
What's going on?

573
01:00:36,387 --> 01:00:38,080
What's going on?

574
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,318
Are we done for today?
Can we go?

575
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,386
- The Reichstag was burned down.
- What?

576
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,646
They say the communists set fire to it.

577
01:00:57,354 --> 01:01:01,480
Your wife wants you
to join her in Paris.

578
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:06,881
She didn't dare phone you. Don't go
back to Berlin. I'm moving to Vienna.

579
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:12,008
Many of your Berlin friends have
vanished lately. Otto Ulrichs is one.

580
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,878
We must be prepared for anything.
I fear we'll never be able to return.

581
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:23,451
The Nazis have blacklists.
Your wife and you are on them.

582
01:01:23,686 --> 01:01:28,585
Please, never go back to Berlin.
Hendrik, promise me that.

583
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:30,945
Please!

584
01:01:52,454 --> 01:01:54,976
Cheers, and many thanks!

585
01:01:57,454 --> 01:01:59,545
Cheers!

586
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:02,848
To the most beautiful
actress in Europe!

587
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:33,282
When are you going home?

588
01:02:33,986 --> 01:02:36,952
I'll stay a few more days in Budapest.

589
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:41,247
Then I'm going to see about
a contract in Vienna.

590
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,783
I understand you, Hendrik.

591
01:02:44,721 --> 01:02:50,051
I'll tell you now, I'm not going
back to Germany, either.

592
01:02:50,153 --> 01:02:52,619
I signed you for this part...

593
01:02:52,721 --> 01:02:57,312
...so you, too, could slip away,
if you want to.

594
01:02:57,686 --> 01:03:02,346
The film studio gave me your
address in Budapest.

595
01:03:02,454 --> 01:03:05,715
I hope my letter reaches you.
I'm in Berlin now.

596
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:08,219
I've landed a part in a comedy.

597
01:03:08,354 --> 01:03:12,343
During the shoot I met the
actress Lotte Lindenthal.

598
01:03:12,586 --> 01:03:17,610
She's friendly with a National
Socialist who's very powerful now.

599
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:23,347
She's wonderful. She never flaunts
what great influence she has.

600
01:03:23,454 --> 01:03:29,784
I told her you were abroad and didn't
dare return, for certain reasons.

601
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:31,715
What's the man afraid of?

602
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:36,480
She said you were an eminent artist
and saw Mephisto several times.

603
01:03:36,586 --> 01:03:42,577
"We need such actors", she said, and
she promised to speak to her friend.

604
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:48,051
This morning she said: "No matter
what silly things Höfgen has done...

605
01:03:48,153 --> 01:03:51,983
...when it's an eminent actor,
people are tolerant".

606
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:57,850
Her friend has promised that nothing
will happen to you if you return.

607
01:03:57,953 --> 01:04:02,249
Hendrik, Berlin awaits you.
You have nothing to fear.

608
01:04:02,354 --> 01:04:07,013
No one can replace you.
Those who rule our lives...

609
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:12,917
...know that the theater is a shelter
for me and people like me...

610
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:16,782
...in which we all feel safe
and have nothing to fear.

611
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:21,047
It would be that for you, too.
Theater is a mission.

612
01:04:21,187 --> 01:04:24,745
In true friendship,
yours, Angelika Siebert.

613
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:20,120
Name?

614
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,186
- Hendrik Höfgen.
- Profession?

615
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,208
Actor.

616
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,308
Where?

617
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:27,743
At the State Theater in Berlin.

618
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:40,415
- Is something wrong?
- No, no.

619
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,677
Thank you.

620
01:05:46,053 --> 01:05:47,246
Thank you.

621
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:55,781
I don't know if you'll
feel at home again here.

622
01:05:57,021 --> 01:06:02,544
The spirit is different from
that you were accustomed to.

623
01:06:04,287 --> 01:06:06,719
Cultural Bolshevism is over.

624
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:14,379
There will no longer be a chance to
appear in your friend's plays...

625
01:06:14,821 --> 01:06:20,617
...or those popular French farces.
We perform German art now.

626
01:06:21,053 --> 01:06:27,610
Frankly, I saw no great reason
to recall you from abroad.

627
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:35,945
But Lotte Lindenthal wants you as
her partner in her comedy début here.

628
01:06:36,554 --> 01:06:39,543
I didn't want to displease her.

629
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:48,415
The role of elegant friend and seducer
shouldn't cause you any difficulty.

630
01:06:50,053 --> 01:06:51,679
I'm so cold.

631
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:54,650
I'll warm you up.

632
01:06:55,153 --> 01:06:58,517
Your room isn't heated
in this dreadful weather?

633
01:06:58,886 --> 01:07:03,285
Is this how you anticipated my visit?
Very nice of you!

634
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:06,715
There's a warm room over there.
Come.

635
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:09,513
No, I'm in a great hurry today.

636
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:11,176
It would warm us up.

637
01:07:11,287 --> 01:07:13,878
No, there's no point in this cold flat.

638
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:16,952
My new maid doesn't
know her duties yet.

639
01:07:17,053 --> 01:07:20,315
You should have told her
your visitor needed warmth.

640
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,885
But I've only just returned home.

641
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:26,646
You should have returned earlier.

642
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:29,981
I'm someone you must
wait for, impatiently.

643
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:34,486
If I want to meet someone in passing,
I have my husband. And besides...

644
01:07:34,586 --> 01:07:39,451
Where did you get this new maid?
She's far too pretty.

645
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:44,979
It's an honor to act with you.

646
01:07:45,087 --> 01:07:48,883
It's so nice to hear
a warm voice again.

647
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:52,510
I'm happy to hear you say that,
I know you're no flatterer.

648
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:57,575
Me, a flatterer? I'm notorious
for telling people the truth.

649
01:07:57,686 --> 01:08:00,017
I like honest people.

650
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:17,649
If she turns, everything will be fine.
If she waves, I've scored a triumph.

651
01:08:19,153 --> 01:08:24,415
After the Reichstag fire,
I had to leave Hamburg.

652
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,179
Bonetti wears a uniform now.

653
01:08:27,487 --> 01:08:30,385
He threw me out of the canteen.

654
01:08:30,586 --> 01:08:33,644
"We've got you now, Böck!" he said.

655
01:08:33,953 --> 01:08:38,079
They almost beat me up,
my landlady threw me out.

656
01:08:38,187 --> 01:08:39,982
I had to leave Hamburg.

657
01:08:40,087 --> 01:08:42,315
Are you upset that I've come?

658
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:47,443
When I heard you were in Berlin,
I found new hope...

659
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:51,781
...and I just came.
Are you angry with me?

660
01:08:52,021 --> 01:08:54,111
I'm not angry with you.

661
01:08:55,854 --> 01:09:02,184
Live here till things settle down,
but don't tell anyone.

662
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:05,878
Just simply disappear without a word.

663
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:12,519
If I were in your position,
I might well commit suicide.

664
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:20,782
I'll buy you a radio, so you'll know
what's happening outside.

665
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:24,852
I've got nobody else
in the world but you.

666
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:28,545
- Is Budapest beautiful?
- I don't know...

667
01:09:29,153 --> 01:09:31,245
Yes, quite nice.

668
01:09:31,554 --> 01:09:34,452
I could have gone there.
Barbara wasn't with you.

669
01:09:34,554 --> 01:09:37,213
They wouldn't have let you
cross the border.

670
01:09:37,354 --> 01:09:42,946
I'm a German citizen, too. My father
was pure German. Why can't I go out?

671
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:48,111
If you can't understand why,
we'll both be in trouble.

672
01:09:49,153 --> 01:09:52,483
- You're horrible.
- You're an idiot!

673
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,881
Go to hell you... you actor!

674
01:10:22,554 --> 01:10:27,418
Dear Lotte, may I ask a great favor?
I have to play Mephisto.

675
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:30,047
I'll see what I can do.

676
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,446
I look forward to seeing
you again as Mephisto.

677
01:10:34,554 --> 01:10:39,486
It's thanks to me you're
playing Mephisto again.

678
01:10:39,754 --> 01:10:45,744
Certain ministerial circles feared
you might revive your old Faust spirit.

679
01:10:45,854 --> 01:10:50,411
The spirit of cultural Bolshevism,
as it was called.

680
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:55,486
Well, I succeeded in
overcoming those fears.

681
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:59,611
Cäsar, thank you,
thank you very much.

682
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:05,886
THANK YOU!

683
01:11:06,021 --> 01:11:08,418
Please give these flowers...

684
01:11:09,354 --> 01:11:11,081
...to Miss Lindenthal.

685
01:11:13,387 --> 01:11:15,819
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

686
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:19,343
Morning, Mr. Höfgen.

687
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:23,317
Mr. Miklas! Are you still around?

688
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,750
- Morning.
- Fine.

689
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:36,245
I've only been here a short space,
I come with a humility to this place...

690
01:11:37,153 --> 01:11:42,745
...to find a teacher of vocation
who's held by all in veneration.

691
01:11:42,854 --> 01:11:46,547
How pleasant is your courtesy!
A man like many more you see.

692
01:11:46,654 --> 01:11:48,779
Have you looked around?

693
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,979
Take me as your student.

694
01:11:52,087 --> 01:11:55,110
I come with courage and my youth.

695
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,209
I want to study with all my heart.

696
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,548
You've come to the right place.

697
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:03,483
I feel like going home I fear.

698
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:07,075
In that great hall
I won't like it at all.

699
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:11,285
You see no grass, you see no tree.

700
01:12:11,387 --> 01:12:17,342
And in the classes we are taught
I lose my hearing, sight and thought.

701
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:19,553
It all depends on habit.

702
01:12:19,654 --> 01:12:23,552
Seeing the breast, a child
might accept the gift unwillingly.

703
01:12:23,654 --> 01:12:25,449
But soon it sucks in delight.

704
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:29,986
So will you, on wisdom's breast,
enjoy it daily with more zest.

705
01:12:30,854 --> 01:12:33,843
Around her neck I'll
cling with pleasure...

706
01:12:33,953 --> 01:12:38,079
...but tell me how can I
find this treasure?

707
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:42,685
When you continue on your way,
which faculty will make your day?

708
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:44,844
Is this where the cut comes?

709
01:12:45,187 --> 01:12:48,415
The art of medicine
is not hard, you know.

710
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,077
You study the world, big and small.

711
01:12:51,187 --> 01:12:54,710
And in the end you let them go
when God demands it.

712
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:57,480
You'll try in vain to learn all science.

713
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:00,644
Each man just learns what he can.

714
01:13:00,786 --> 01:13:04,947
But he who grasps every chance
he is the worthy man.

715
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:10,418
You are still of pleasing build
with self-confidence at last instilled...

716
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:14,077
...others will have confidence in you.

717
01:13:14,187 --> 01:13:17,449
Especially learn
the women to enthrall.

718
01:13:17,554 --> 01:13:21,247
Eternal moans, a thousand ills.

719
01:13:21,354 --> 01:13:25,048
There's just one place to cure them.

720
01:13:25,153 --> 01:13:31,382
If you've honor to some degree
one may allow some shared intimacy.

721
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:38,812
A title helps to make her certain
your art exceeds that of your peers.

722
01:13:38,921 --> 01:13:43,319
And may grant you a glimpse of which
another schemes for many years.

723
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,409
Her pulse you must learn to feel.

724
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,919
And burning looks you
then must steal.

725
01:13:51,021 --> 01:13:58,976
Her slender hips are then embraced
to see how tightly she is laced.

726
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:03,279
That's what I could care for.

727
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:09,819
Gray, my friend is all theory.
And green the golden tree of life.

728
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,843
That's the way.

729
01:14:35,287 --> 01:14:39,379
I greet the learned gentleman!
You made me to sweat profusely.

730
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,078
- What is your name?
- The question's odd...

731
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:44,847
...for someone who idle talk despises.

732
01:14:44,953 --> 01:14:48,943
Who, far removed from worldly show
seeks only academic prizes.

733
01:14:49,754 --> 01:14:53,846
With you, one knows your game
generally by your very name.

734
01:14:53,953 --> 01:14:58,545
It's evident, Sire
if one's called a liar.

735
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,208
Who are you?

736
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,548
I'm a part of that force...

737
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:06,380
...that always craves evil
and always creates good.

738
01:15:06,487 --> 01:15:08,009
What is this riddle?

739
01:15:08,121 --> 01:15:10,109
I'm the spirit who negates.

740
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:14,585
And rightly so, for all creation
is worthy of annihilation.

741
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:17,346
So it were better,
nothing were created.

742
01:15:17,454 --> 01:15:22,512
And so everything you've stated
is sin, destruction, devilment.

743
01:15:22,654 --> 01:15:25,143
Remains my actual element.

744
01:15:26,854 --> 01:15:30,251
Good evening. The Prime Minister
invites you to his box.

745
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:33,141
Yes.

746
01:15:44,654 --> 01:15:46,643
It's all going like clockwork.

747
01:16:01,786 --> 01:16:05,776
May I introduce you to
my distinguished colleague?

748
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,119
Ah, our Mephistoles.

749
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,219
Congratulations.

750
01:16:25,854 --> 01:16:29,683
That mask is perfect, it's evil itself.
It's sacred evil.

751
01:16:30,554 --> 01:16:36,350
Yet, your eyes are so kind,
your handshake so soft. It's strange...

752
01:16:37,087 --> 01:16:44,146
...it seems the secret of acting is
to portray strength, yet one is weak.

753
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:54,150
I imagine you've prepared
for this role for a long time.

754
01:16:54,454 --> 01:16:56,647
All my life, Prime Minister.

755
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:02,343
That's the only way.
That is the secret of greatness.

756
01:17:37,454 --> 01:17:38,783
Break a leg.

757
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,386
Carry on the good work, Mephistoles.

758
01:17:55,454 --> 01:17:56,818
Höfgen residence.

759
01:17:57,487 --> 01:17:58,611
Lotte Lindenthal.

760
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:03,018
Höfgen.

761
01:18:03,121 --> 01:18:04,381
- Hendrik?
- Yes.

762
01:18:04,487 --> 01:18:07,681
Will you come to us
after tonight's performance?

763
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:10,149
There'll be just a few friends here.

764
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:14,151
With pleasure. Thank you very much.

765
01:18:16,087 --> 01:18:22,986
Böck!
Just a few friends will be there.

766
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:31,044
Am I not an incredible villain?

767
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:34,511
Why a villain?
You're just successful, Mr. Höfgen.

768
01:18:34,754 --> 01:18:39,811
To the renewal of German culture.
Long live the actors.

769
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:51,648
Our theater has many elements that
have nothing to do with Germany.

770
01:18:51,821 --> 01:18:56,412
We must set up a customs control
of the mind for culture smugglers...

771
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:02,847
...to stop foreign elements poisoning
German literature and theater.

772
01:19:03,354 --> 01:19:07,786
This can't be left entirely
to our frontier guards.

773
01:19:08,053 --> 01:19:12,179
Everyone must cooperate
in this control.

774
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,679
- Am I understood?
- Yes, General.

775
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:18,382
There are many who
don't understand.

776
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:22,418
Look at this painting, my Mephisto.

777
01:19:23,354 --> 01:19:25,877
A masterpiece of
German romanticism.

778
01:19:28,253 --> 01:19:33,777
Where did I find it? At an art dealer
with an foreign accent.

779
01:19:33,886 --> 01:19:37,319
I had it restored. No, no...

780
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,412
...the future of painting doesn't
belong to the Liebermanns.

781
01:19:42,854 --> 01:19:45,149
Your Mephisto occupies my mind.

782
01:19:45,454 --> 01:19:49,682
You've brought him alive.
He's a hell of a guy.

783
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:53,619
Isn't there a little of him in all of us?

784
01:19:54,554 --> 01:19:59,350
I mean, isn't there a bit of Mephisto
in every German?

785
01:19:59,821 --> 01:20:04,912
Wouldn't our enemies love it if we
had nothing but the soul of Faust?

786
01:20:05,053 --> 01:20:10,577
No, Mephisto is also
a German national hero.

787
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,278
It's just something we
mustn't tell people.

788
01:20:15,153 --> 01:20:16,914
I must go now.

789
01:20:17,121 --> 01:20:21,984
Come to my office at 10:30,
the day after tomorrow.

790
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:25,883
Some foreign journalists
want to know many things.

791
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:30,646
Above all, what 'Germany' means
today, and the German culture.

792
01:20:30,754 --> 01:20:36,653
I'll tell them. You can elaborate on
what I say about theater, for example.

793
01:20:36,886 --> 01:20:41,614
Painting, architecture, sculpture,
plenty to write about.

794
01:20:41,854 --> 01:20:44,877
I want them to be
informed by experts.

795
01:20:48,854 --> 01:20:52,910
Tell me, why do you have
such a limp handshake?

796
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:07,181
So, we meet again. How time flies!
You were wonderful as Mephisto.

797
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:11,413
Now you act him more forcefully.
But I liked the other one, too.

798
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,179
I sensed it in the seed of what
can now be unfolded to the full.

799
01:22:16,287 --> 01:22:19,845
I also liked you in the play
with Lotte Lindenthal.

800
01:22:19,953 --> 01:22:24,113
The ideal actress to portray
the ideal German woman.

801
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:30,847
What are we doing here? Why is
he wasting his time with foreigners?

802
01:22:31,487 --> 01:22:38,215
He said they're interested in German
culture. They'll ask a few questions.

803
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,048
- I see. You spoke to him?
- Yes.

804
01:22:41,153 --> 01:22:44,278
How are you?
Nice to meet you again.

805
01:22:44,387 --> 01:22:48,319
The Prime Minister sent for me.
I hope this doesn't last too long.

806
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:53,182
Always problems with the old statues.
Shall we tear them down or not?

807
01:22:53,287 --> 01:22:56,684
As if that were important
for our future.

808
01:22:57,053 --> 01:22:59,519
I'd like to sculpt
a bust of you, Höfgen.

809
01:22:59,686 --> 01:23:04,812
What sort of man are you? Your own
face differs amazingly from Mephisto.

810
01:23:04,921 --> 01:23:07,909
In private life, you look rather shy.

811
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:12,147
I'll do a bust of you,
but in clay or in bronze?

812
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,549
- What is your face made of?
- Perhaps a mixture.

813
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:21,416
I very much enjoyed your Mephisto.
I only had eyes for you.

814
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,712
I'm preparing an exhibition.

815
01:23:23,821 --> 01:23:28,514
The General wants a pre view.
Try to come. Here's my number.

816
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,952
If you have time, give me a ring
and come to my studio.

817
01:23:34,121 --> 01:23:37,678
You can relax while I model you.
How strange your face is.

818
01:23:37,786 --> 01:23:40,616
A German face yet it
changes every moment.

819
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:44,209
That's acting.
The rest is humility and hard work.

820
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:51,318
I've discovered your secret.
It's the surprise effect, right?

821
01:23:52,686 --> 01:23:54,515
The unexpected.

822
01:23:56,121 --> 01:24:00,553
I've been watching the way you
appear on stage. Always different.

823
01:24:02,986 --> 01:24:05,111
Sometimes quick, erratic.

824
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:08,913
Then slow, suddenly,
when the audience is lulled.

825
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:12,485
But always surprising
and unpredictable.

826
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:17,619
Thus you create the feeling
of something original...

827
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:22,381
...even if the spectator
knows your lines by heart.

828
01:24:22,886 --> 01:24:27,978
And your glib tongue, your deliberate
pa uses, your precise emphasis.

829
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:32,052
I think I'm learning from you.

830
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,615
It's important to be unpredictable.

831
01:24:36,721 --> 01:24:42,347
Spectators needn't know what
my next step is or where I'm going.

832
01:24:42,487 --> 01:24:46,180
- They're not prepared, it's a shock.
- Exactly.

833
01:24:46,387 --> 01:24:51,410
Yet it was only a change of pace,
or a slightly longer pa use.

834
01:24:51,554 --> 01:24:55,316
In the theater it's the others
who make the king a king.

835
01:24:55,420 --> 01:25:02,114
Building the role is all important;
pianissimo alternating with fortissimo.

836
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,744
Naturally, you need a
certain flair, artistic talent...

837
01:25:06,854 --> 01:25:10,218
...and as I usually say,
a high degree of culture.

838
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:13,343
When I hear the word culture,
I reach for my revolver.

839
01:25:13,454 --> 01:25:19,716
Bourgeois nonsense! Bolsheviks
preach it to win over school teachers.

840
01:25:19,821 --> 01:25:22,252
To say nothing of artists.
Isn't that so?

841
01:25:23,454 --> 01:25:27,318
I wasn't untouched by
Bolshevik trends, either.

842
01:25:27,654 --> 01:25:31,677
And I must admit that for a while
I flirted with the left.

843
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:37,514
Well, anyone can get
involved in some folly.

844
01:25:38,554 --> 01:25:42,008
Those were troubled times.
Let's have a drink.

845
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:56,177
General, other deserving artists
committed the follies I did.

846
01:25:56,287 --> 01:26:01,720
I don't forget those paying for sins for
which I've been generously pardoned.

847
01:26:02,454 --> 01:26:07,409
I'm pleading for a certain person,
for a friend.

848
01:26:08,053 --> 01:26:12,645
I guarantee he's reformed.
I'm pleading for Otto Ulrichs.

849
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,680
Otto Ulrichs? Who's he?

850
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:20,911
He ran the communist cabaret,
'The Storm-Bird'.

851
01:26:22,586 --> 01:26:28,213
Well... he must be
a pretty bad fellow.

852
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,683
No, he's not bad.

853
01:26:30,786 --> 01:26:35,276
A bit rash, I admit.
A bit thoughtless, but not bad.

854
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,475
If anything, he's too decent.
Once he gives his word, he keeps it.

855
01:26:58,586 --> 01:27:01,246
I'm back at the State Theater.

856
01:27:02,354 --> 01:27:06,013
The funny thing is,
I simply can't believe it.

857
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:12,853
Just as I can't believe
I'm here with you by the window.

858
01:27:13,586 --> 01:27:16,519
I know it's reality, but I don't feel it.

859
01:27:40,454 --> 01:27:43,443
- Great.
- Magnificent, really.

860
01:27:43,554 --> 01:27:45,315
A German work of art.

861
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:48,944
Not every German artist is
capable of such work.

862
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:52,286
It is a courageous work.

863
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:01,346
Come, Mephisto.

864
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,210
You sign, too.

865
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:16,411
What did I prophesy?
The exhibition is a success.

866
01:28:35,454 --> 01:28:38,443
You rascal, so you make
secret visits here.

867
01:28:41,187 --> 01:28:46,279
If I may add something personal,
it is a courageous work.

868
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:49,649
Courageous,
because it captures our time...

869
01:28:49,786 --> 01:28:55,014
...the beauty of strength
without bourgeois snobbery.

870
01:28:55,153 --> 01:28:57,847
Contrasting the degenerate taste...

871
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,685
...of the loud-mouths of culture.

872
01:29:00,786 --> 01:29:07,685
We see muscles and clear-cut
features mankind wants to see.

873
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:10,719
Strong and beautiful in his strength.

874
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:14,778
Warrior-like and victorious
in his struggle.

875
01:29:22,854 --> 01:29:26,286
Hello Hendrik.
That was a wonderful speech.

876
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,677
- You know each other?
- Very well.

877
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:33,186
You're in Berlin? Since when?

878
01:29:33,287 --> 01:29:36,720
I'm here because
I want to dine with you.

879
01:29:36,821 --> 01:29:40,082
I haven't seen you for so long.

880
01:29:40,187 --> 01:29:42,085
So where will we go?

881
01:29:43,121 --> 01:29:47,019
Your choice. How's Hamburg?
Surviving without me?

882
01:29:47,754 --> 01:29:51,447
I'm in Berlin to have dinner with you.
Hamburg is history.

883
01:29:51,554 --> 01:29:56,077
You're out of touch. Kroge's in
Switzerland. He just vanished.

884
01:29:56,187 --> 01:29:59,950
Didn't even tell his girl. Simply went.

885
01:30:01,153 --> 01:30:02,880
Kroge is a traitor.

886
01:30:09,754 --> 01:30:11,947
Why must you appear with them?

887
01:30:12,053 --> 01:30:13,849
Because they asked me to.

888
01:30:13,953 --> 01:30:16,852
They ask others, too. You needn't go.

889
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:23,648
You can't refuse, none of us can.
If anyone says they do, they're lying.

890
01:30:24,387 --> 01:30:28,251
Besides, the General's a nice chap
and he knows a lot about the theater.

891
01:30:28,354 --> 01:30:31,149
He's not so closed minded
as most others.

892
01:30:31,253 --> 01:30:36,948
A well behaved boy who wants to
enjoy the rewards for good behavior.

893
01:30:37,053 --> 01:30:40,247
- Yes, I like to be well behaved.
- Because you're afraid.

894
01:30:42,886 --> 01:30:46,011
- I like it.
- Then you should.

895
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:50,644
It will be difficult to stay with me
and maintain good behavior.

896
01:30:55,253 --> 01:30:57,845
Damned black woman, right?

897
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:01,744
I can't help being different
from what's allowed here.

898
01:31:01,854 --> 01:31:06,115
People can spit in my face
in the street.

899
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:09,119
Only I can't do anything about it.

900
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:13,676
My nose, my hair remain the same
even if I want something else.

901
01:31:13,786 --> 01:31:18,412
Yet, I'm German, a German Negro.
German is my mother tongue.

902
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,781
What am I supposed to do?
Where should I go?

903
01:31:21,921 --> 01:31:25,580
I don't know. I don't even know
what will become of me.

904
01:31:26,487 --> 01:31:28,578
You think only of yourself.

905
01:31:28,754 --> 01:31:32,379
And like an idiot,
I dreamt of us having a child.

906
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,883
That's all we need.

907
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:40,576
Is the child to be to blame, for she
might ruin her father's career?

908
01:31:40,686 --> 01:31:42,515
That's enough now!

909
01:31:43,253 --> 01:31:46,810
- That's enough of that now!
- Now it is enough?

910
01:31:47,121 --> 01:31:53,610
I can see why your wife
couldn't stand living with you.

911
01:31:55,921 --> 01:32:00,012
Here... I pinched a photo
of you once. Look at it!

912
01:32:00,654 --> 01:32:02,347
Do you recognize yourself?

913
01:32:02,487 --> 01:32:04,385
I must speak to you.

914
01:32:04,854 --> 01:32:07,649
To tell me what you've said
behind my back?

915
01:32:07,754 --> 01:32:09,447
I don't know what you mean.

916
01:32:09,554 --> 01:32:13,213
Höfgen would bury his mother alive.
Didn't you say that?

917
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,184
I won't dispute that I dislike you.

918
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:19,846
- What do you want?
- I want you to sign this.

919
01:32:19,953 --> 01:32:22,283
My signature? What for?

920
01:32:22,487 --> 01:32:26,180
You want a raise?
Or do you collect signatures...

921
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:30,344
...because theater safety
regulations are a bit unsafe?

922
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:37,541
From a moral standpoint much seems
unsafe. And I don't mean the theater.

923
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,319
What do you protest against?

924
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:44,908
Against a leadership that
disregards our rights.

925
01:32:46,287 --> 01:32:50,014
But you were in the Nazi party,
back when you were in Hamburg.

926
01:32:50,121 --> 01:32:51,710
I'm leaving the party.

927
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,176
That's your business.

928
01:32:55,554 --> 01:32:59,952
I'd like to ask you to
read our protest and sign it.

929
01:33:01,586 --> 01:33:06,985
Regardless of my opinion, you are
today's leading German actor.

930
01:33:08,454 --> 01:33:11,511
Let me say that
I won't even read this thing.

931
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:17,081
Be careful not to get yourself
and others into real trouble.

932
01:33:17,454 --> 01:33:19,545
Miklas, you can go to hell.

933
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:28,019
I won't let a dirty pig like you
provoke me.

934
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:46,844
Dear God.

935
01:33:49,886 --> 01:33:52,478
Congratulations, my dear Höfgen.

936
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:57,645
You put it precisely.
Some elements must go to the devil.

937
01:33:57,754 --> 01:34:01,208
If you were a soldier,
I'd promote you. I'm very pleased.

938
01:34:02,654 --> 01:34:06,245
By the way, you needn't be afraid.

939
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:13,049
For the fun of it, I checked
your horoscope. It's excellent.

940
01:34:13,786 --> 01:34:16,719
- Best of luck, Höfgen.
- Thank you.

941
01:34:23,387 --> 01:34:24,716
Did something happen?

942
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:31,484
Good morning.

943
01:34:54,786 --> 01:34:56,275
Get walking!

944
01:35:34,487 --> 01:35:40,386
The management regrets that Hans
Miklas has died in a car accident.

945
01:35:44,053 --> 01:35:45,916
How awful, such a young fellow.

946
01:35:48,387 --> 01:35:52,444
But, frankly, there was something
disquieting about him...

947
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,146
...don't you think?

948
01:35:57,053 --> 01:35:58,882
Disquieting...

949
01:36:12,487 --> 01:36:15,078
That was no car accident.

950
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:22,481
He must have come to you, too,
with that protest.

951
01:36:22,586 --> 01:36:27,178
Are you insane?
How can you talk such nonsense?

952
01:36:27,854 --> 01:36:31,183
Why shouldn't it have
been a car accident?

953
01:36:31,586 --> 01:36:35,349
The government would stage
a car accident...

954
01:36:35,454 --> 01:36:38,046
...all for some unknown actor?

955
01:36:39,354 --> 01:36:42,013
We're not in some
tenth-rate melodrama.

956
01:36:42,854 --> 01:36:46,377
People shouldn't cross
roads in heavy traffic.

957
01:36:54,153 --> 01:36:59,381
I've great plans for you. We're alone.
You can refuse and remain an actor.

958
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:04,108
But then you can't do as much
for our cause as you could.

959
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:09,782
Your speech was good.
I realized you're not only an actor.

960
01:37:11,087 --> 01:37:17,077
You put the essence into words.
Write your own biography, Hendrik.

961
01:37:17,953 --> 01:37:22,852
Submit it to me, as soon as possible.
Höfgen...

962
01:37:23,686 --> 01:37:28,120
...you will manage the Prussian
State Theater. Your task is easy:

963
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:34,016
A full house and a wildly
enthusiastic, audience for you.

964
01:37:34,686 --> 01:37:35,778
Do you understand?

965
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:43,075
No need to enlarge upon
those matters in Hamburg.

966
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:48,914
Nor need we mention
the Revolutionary Theater.

967
01:37:49,021 --> 01:37:51,815
Just mention some of
your roles there.

968
01:37:58,087 --> 01:38:02,020
What did you really imagine
in Hamburg?

969
01:38:03,821 --> 01:38:06,150
How could you have conceived...

970
01:38:07,387 --> 01:38:13,752
...promoting Russian Bolshevism?
You, a German. Incredible!

971
01:38:14,986 --> 01:38:17,816
- Where is your wife now?
- In Paris, I believe.

972
01:38:17,921 --> 01:38:22,444
No, she's in Amsterdam,
working against her Motherland.

973
01:38:22,554 --> 01:38:24,815
They're publishing a newspaper.

974
01:38:28,153 --> 01:38:30,551
You don't correspond with her?

975
01:38:31,053 --> 01:38:34,213
We have no contact at all.

976
01:38:34,586 --> 01:38:38,145
You'll get a divorce easily.
I'll see to that.

977
01:38:39,686 --> 01:38:42,482
German citizens
who have left Germany...

978
01:38:42,654 --> 01:38:47,052
...couldn't wipe us out, so they
signed their own death sentence.

979
01:38:47,287 --> 01:38:50,651
Where weakness perishes,
humanity becomes healthy.

980
01:38:50,786 --> 01:38:53,911
Politics, like theater, is a fight.

981
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:58,346
Just as every rebuild
is the start of a new war.

982
01:39:00,821 --> 01:39:03,252
But we're not talking about this now.

983
01:39:04,886 --> 01:39:10,945
Hamburg...
"In a harbor town by the river..."

984
01:39:12,754 --> 01:39:17,617
Lots of foreigners, night clubs, bars.
I understand you perfectly.

985
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,384
But in the Reich's capital?
No offense, we're men, but...

986
01:39:24,554 --> 01:39:30,214
What's this Hamburg souvenir
doing here? Juliette Martens.

987
01:39:31,854 --> 01:39:33,877
Is she kept by you?

988
01:39:38,686 --> 01:39:42,278
You once, rightfully, said...

989
01:39:42,654 --> 01:39:46,245
...Professor Bruckner was
not a man of the future.

990
01:39:46,921 --> 01:39:50,613
And, even more rightly,
you parted from his daughter.

991
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,713
If you have such a good instinct
for a healthy, clean attitude...

992
01:39:56,354 --> 01:39:59,219
...what's this Negro-woman
doing in Berlin?

993
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:03,517
Mephisto...

994
01:40:05,721 --> 01:40:10,982
...it defies racial purity.
Don't even keep her picture at home.

995
01:40:11,287 --> 01:40:12,275
General...

996
01:40:12,387 --> 01:40:14,250
Wait, I haven't finished.

997
01:40:15,721 --> 01:40:19,380
I hope you completely
understood me.

998
01:40:22,654 --> 01:40:24,120
- Yes.
- So?

999
01:40:25,554 --> 01:40:28,883
- She's not to come to any harm.
- Leave that to me.

1000
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:33,648
I'd like to request, Prime Minister...

1001
01:40:33,754 --> 01:40:37,413
...that she'd be allowed
to leave Germany unharmed.

1002
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:44,441
Agreed. She'll be taken to the frontier
and good-bye. That's what we'll do.

1003
01:40:45,021 --> 01:40:50,351
And you'll hold a press conference,
giving information about the theater.

1004
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,486
The repertoire, plans
and your performances.

1005
01:40:53,821 --> 01:40:59,378
In October there'll be a big cultural
e vent in our Paris embassy.

1006
01:40:59,487 --> 01:41:01,816
I'd like you to attend it.

1007
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:12,946
Böck. I bet they know about him, too.

1008
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:17,719
Böck, Böck, my note-book.

1009
01:41:20,053 --> 01:41:21,519
Böck stays.

1010
01:41:24,253 --> 01:41:27,083
- Here it is.
- Give it to me.

1011
01:41:29,354 --> 01:41:33,513
I have to call friends.
I urgently need a friend.

1012
01:41:34,087 --> 01:41:38,645
- Find me a friend.
- But you've so many friends.

1013
01:41:40,721 --> 01:41:41,913
Friends...

1014
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:58,585
Call Miss Nicoletta von Niebuhr.
Find the number and call her.

1015
01:42:07,786 --> 01:42:09,753
Shall I make coffee, or tea?

1016
01:42:09,886 --> 01:42:12,853
Shall I become manager? Yes or no?

1017
01:42:13,953 --> 01:42:17,579
Can I? May I? Must I?

1018
01:42:18,287 --> 01:42:21,741
Is it my duty?
Can I make myself useful?

1019
01:42:21,854 --> 01:42:25,683
I mean, can I help anyone?
And if so, should I?

1020
01:42:26,821 --> 01:42:30,480
Or shall I look at it as a new role?

1021
01:42:30,654 --> 01:42:32,745
Or shall I emigrate to America?

1022
01:42:32,854 --> 01:42:36,115
I can earn as much in films
as Dora Martin.

1023
01:42:36,754 --> 01:42:40,708
If I accept such an office
of this government, then...

1024
01:42:44,287 --> 01:42:46,185
Do I want to, at all?

1025
01:42:47,986 --> 01:42:49,781
They need me.

1026
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:53,413
I was about to emigrate...

1027
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:58,044
...and the Prussian Minister
asks me to rescue his theater.

1028
01:42:58,187 --> 01:43:01,120
Tomorrow morning I must
give him an answer.

1029
01:43:02,387 --> 01:43:07,081
Heaven evidently has
great plans for me.

1030
01:43:07,253 --> 01:43:08,651
Then you've won.

1031
01:43:11,153 --> 01:43:12,880
Would you help me?

1032
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,815
I'd be proud of you.

1033
01:43:19,953 --> 01:43:22,476
Yes, I'll help you Hendrik.

1034
01:43:37,121 --> 01:43:39,211
If only one could live forever.

1035
01:43:49,187 --> 01:43:53,677
Here's your passport for France.
You have five minutes to pack.

1036
01:43:53,854 --> 01:43:55,251
Yes, but why?

1037
01:43:55,354 --> 01:43:57,615
We're waiting. Hurry up.

1038
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,552
You needn't thank me for this raise.

1039
01:44:11,654 --> 01:44:15,177
I made it a condition for
taking over this job.

1040
01:44:15,354 --> 01:44:17,149
Everything's covered with dust.

1041
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:23,551
If you don't clean the dressing rooms
as well as all the others...

1042
01:44:24,153 --> 01:44:27,551
...you may have to look
for another job.

1043
01:44:27,921 --> 01:44:33,285
I hope we'll get along. If you have
any problems, come to me.

1044
01:44:33,387 --> 01:44:37,080
I would like to treat you all to coffee.

1045
01:44:39,087 --> 01:44:43,281
Allow me to give you the money.
I'm sorry I can't come with you.

1046
01:44:43,454 --> 01:44:46,147
Joachim would like to speak to you.

1047
01:44:46,253 --> 01:44:47,513
Wait, Hannelore!

1048
01:44:48,287 --> 01:44:50,116
Wait, Hannelore!

1049
01:44:55,454 --> 01:44:58,181
So, now he can enter.

1050
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:05,182
Please consider decent roles for me.
You're not like the other managers.

1051
01:45:05,287 --> 01:45:08,344
You're an actor yourself.
You understand.

1052
01:45:09,454 --> 01:45:12,477
I must act as if he's
saying something important.

1053
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:18,515
When you talk to actors, you must put
them at ease. That goes for me, too.

1054
01:45:18,686 --> 01:45:25,381
No, I don't like Premières. All night
one has to wear a big, frozen smile.

1055
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:27,851
I hate that.

1056
01:45:29,921 --> 01:45:34,353
You think it's a good costume?
I don't! I think it's terrible!

1057
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:37,879
Good morning, Mr. Kappelmüller.
How are you?

1058
01:45:37,986 --> 01:45:40,077
- Good.
- How's the family?

1059
01:45:40,187 --> 01:45:43,983
So your daughter graduated as
a hairdresser. Maybe we can use her.

1060
01:45:44,886 --> 01:45:46,216
Good morning.

1061
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:54,120
Haven't you noticed? New suit,
new shoes, new manager, no? Well.

1062
01:45:54,487 --> 01:45:59,749
...ex-Bolshevik Höfgen, manager of
the Prussian State Theater...

1063
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:04,548
...is letting his former comrade
appear in his production of Hamlet.

1064
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:14,750
Hannelore! Was the cast list
for Hamlet posted yet?

1065
01:46:14,854 --> 01:46:15,910
Not yet.

1066
01:46:16,654 --> 01:46:20,881
Good. Let's wait another two days.
Thank you.

1067
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:29,811
I must offer them more
than old comrades.

1068
01:46:30,087 --> 01:46:35,247
You must cultivate connections.
That's the essence of the system.

1069
01:46:35,387 --> 01:46:39,842
Let me tell you, yesterday I went to
the Prussian State Theater...

1070
01:46:39,953 --> 01:46:44,942
...it was Faust and the name of some
white-faced clown was Mephisto.

1071
01:46:45,053 --> 01:46:49,952
What a joke! And Mephisto by some
man called Höfgen, it was terrible!

1072
01:46:50,053 --> 01:46:54,509
I'd rather go to the Bavarian
People's Theater. Goodbye then.

1073
01:46:55,354 --> 01:46:58,013
Why am I doing all this?

1074
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:00,808
Because I enjoy it.

1075
01:47:00,921 --> 01:47:06,353
I must enjoy amateur plays and use
actors that are blonde not talented.

1076
01:47:06,454 --> 01:47:08,750
Most are totally untalented.

1077
01:47:08,921 --> 01:47:13,376
A Frankfurt audience
applauded Marquis Posa's...

1078
01:47:13,487 --> 01:47:17,647
...'Give us freedom of thought'.
Performance stopped, play withdrawn.

1079
01:47:17,754 --> 01:47:22,482
In Munich, 'The Robbers', withdrawn.
Schiller, our national poet!

1080
01:47:22,586 --> 01:47:27,451
They want to produce plays by
German authors. But what authors?

1081
01:47:27,586 --> 01:47:33,541
Those who haven't emigrated
aren't allowed to write, or won't.

1082
01:47:34,654 --> 01:47:39,585
It's simply impossible to offer
theater worthy of the name.

1083
01:47:39,754 --> 01:47:47,016
Unless I dig up a couple of old farces.
All Rococo wigs and white faces.

1084
01:47:50,087 --> 01:47:56,713
The joke is that the regime now sees
Shakespeare as one of our own.

1085
01:47:56,821 --> 01:48:01,116
Let's do 'As You Like It',
'Where the Banished Return.'

1086
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:05,409
Show the opponents of dictatorship
that the will for freedom still lives.

1087
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,282
I didn't hear that!
I can't possibly have heard that!

1088
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,615
Am I not an incredible villain?

1089
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:23,113
Isn't what I'm doing insane?

1090
01:48:28,986 --> 01:48:32,510
"Fürst and Niklisch, both on
the staff of your theater...

1091
01:48:32,821 --> 01:48:37,809
...on grounds of German
racial purity... dismiss them."

1092
01:48:38,921 --> 01:48:40,909
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1093
01:48:42,021 --> 01:48:45,578
- Well, how are you?
- Fine.

1094
01:48:48,454 --> 01:48:52,442
- And you?
- Everything all right.

1095
01:48:52,821 --> 01:48:56,583
The stage-hands that are concerned,
Fürst and Niklisch...

1096
01:48:57,454 --> 01:48:59,783
...are indispensable...

1097
01:49:02,554 --> 01:49:06,146
...and the loss of their services...

1098
01:49:06,754 --> 01:49:11,879
...would jeopardize the theater's
work. Date. Heil! Signature.

1099
01:49:17,053 --> 01:49:20,145
Germans!
Don't tolerate Nazi oppression.

1100
01:50:33,654 --> 01:50:35,847
Embassy of the German Reich

1101
01:50:59,953 --> 01:51:03,942
Did you bring me anything from
Germany? A leather coat, at least?

1102
01:51:04,454 --> 01:51:05,885
- Leather coat?
- Yes.

1103
01:51:05,986 --> 01:51:12,112
It's the fashion for men. Those who
took me to the frontier had them.

1104
01:51:17,487 --> 01:51:21,612
Your eyes are so dead,
how do they look?

1105
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:25,015
- Empty?
- No, dazed.

1106
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:27,609
Yes, that's how I felt these past days.

1107
01:51:27,721 --> 01:51:30,414
You see? You were never like that.

1108
01:51:31,953 --> 01:51:36,079
I've thought a lot about you.
I believe I should be grateful.

1109
01:51:36,754 --> 01:51:40,742
Without you, I'd be in a
concentration camp, or already dead.

1110
01:51:42,686 --> 01:51:46,914
If you still like being with me,
then stay here.

1111
01:51:47,153 --> 01:51:50,812
I'll look after you. You needn't
leave the house, not at first.

1112
01:51:50,921 --> 01:51:53,909
Then we'll find jobs. You're so gifted.

1113
01:51:54,686 --> 01:51:57,778
- I could have gone to America.
- There you go.

1114
01:51:58,387 --> 01:52:01,478
I think I really was gifted.

1115
01:52:01,721 --> 01:52:03,709
But also a terrible coward.

1116
01:52:04,354 --> 01:52:08,878
What do I do elsewhere? Be an extra,
a stage-hand, a technician?

1117
01:52:10,253 --> 01:52:14,117
Do you think these hands
were made for manual labor?

1118
01:52:14,487 --> 01:52:17,476
I'll provide for you.
What else do you want?

1119
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:19,712
Success.

1120
01:52:19,821 --> 01:52:24,150
Hendrik Höfgen, just imagine...
you'd belong to me.

1121
01:52:26,686 --> 01:52:29,982
Juliette, I have to go now.

1122
01:52:32,153 --> 01:52:35,245
- Shall I see you again?
- I don't know.

1123
01:52:35,354 --> 01:52:40,615
- Can I see you off at the station?
- No, you don't fit into the picture.

1124
01:52:43,586 --> 01:52:47,246
All right, forget the station.
Just do what you want.

1125
01:52:47,921 --> 01:52:49,386
I do.

1126
01:52:51,354 --> 01:52:52,842
That's why I'm here.

1127
01:52:55,721 --> 01:52:59,812
Juliette, don't write anymore.
It's no good.

1128
01:53:43,921 --> 01:53:46,352
There aren't many people in this café.

1129
01:53:49,187 --> 01:53:52,245
Would you prefer to sit in the sun?
You like that.

1130
01:53:52,354 --> 01:53:55,979
No. Though I haven't had
much sunshine lately.

1131
01:53:59,287 --> 01:54:02,776
May I ask you something?
Do you still live alone?

1132
01:54:03,354 --> 01:54:05,946
No, I've got friends. And you?

1133
01:54:06,686 --> 01:54:10,709
Friends... in times like these?
It's difficult.

1134
01:54:12,021 --> 01:54:16,316
How can you still live in Berlin?
What keeps you there?

1135
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:18,817
Barbara, I live in the theater.

1136
01:54:18,986 --> 01:54:20,850
And that is in Berlin?

1137
01:54:20,986 --> 01:54:24,816
I don't think you can judge
from Paris.

1138
01:54:28,754 --> 01:54:33,311
You're more than an actor now.
You took an oath. You're a manager.

1139
01:54:33,554 --> 01:54:36,520
I didn't take the oath,
I just moved my lips.

1140
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:40,017
Someone has to save our
values for a better world.

1141
01:54:40,153 --> 01:54:46,143
I'm playing Hamlet, whether those
in power like Shakespeare or not.

1142
01:54:46,487 --> 01:54:52,942
Shakespeare is their ornament to
prove "we're not as bad as you think".

1143
01:54:53,053 --> 01:54:54,781
You can't stay in Berlin.

1144
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:59,478
I have a family in Berlin.
You know I'm married to the theater.

1145
01:54:59,854 --> 01:55:02,717
I can help people who are
having a hard time.

1146
01:55:02,821 --> 01:55:06,184
If I leave, nothing better
will replace me.

1147
01:55:06,754 --> 01:55:07,810
Words!

1148
01:55:08,821 --> 01:55:11,082
It's always the same with you.

1149
01:55:11,187 --> 01:55:14,483
Your method of self-deception
is still intact.

1150
01:55:15,287 --> 01:55:21,220
Don't you see? Whoever you save,
it's only a gesture to your friends.

1151
01:55:21,554 --> 01:55:26,077
You're in a show-case, legalizing
these people will be attached to you.

1152
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:29,982
We can't choose when
and where we're born.

1153
01:55:30,287 --> 01:55:32,276
An entire people can't emigrate.

1154
01:55:32,387 --> 01:55:37,614
As an actor I'm obliged to live in
my country, to observe and portray it.

1155
01:55:37,721 --> 01:55:41,914
And I can tell you, there are
decent people among them.

1156
01:55:42,287 --> 01:55:49,345
I hate coffee shop intellectuals and
I hate such resistance-fighters, too.

1157
01:55:49,454 --> 01:55:55,353
The really valuable, such as theater
and art can rise above everything.

1158
01:55:55,786 --> 01:55:57,412
That's my conviction.

1159
01:55:57,586 --> 01:56:00,018
Why did you want to meet me?

1160
01:56:00,586 --> 01:56:04,110
Well, I don't really know why.

1161
01:56:07,854 --> 01:56:10,376
It might even be dangerous for you.

1162
01:56:13,953 --> 01:56:17,477
Tell me, Barbara, did you ever...

1163
01:56:19,053 --> 01:56:20,643
...really love me?

1164
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:29,951
Why did I come here today? If you'd
been listening, you wouldn't ask that.

1165
01:56:31,654 --> 01:56:35,177
If you don't accept what's
happening in Germany...

1166
01:56:35,287 --> 01:56:37,220
...why do you still live there?

1167
01:56:37,354 --> 01:56:39,785
What does freedom mean for you?

1168
01:56:40,053 --> 01:56:44,542
Do you need it to live? Or do you just
need to be successful and loved?

1169
01:56:44,821 --> 01:56:48,150
I'm satisfied with success.
It means many love me.

1170
01:56:48,253 --> 01:56:51,049
And the fury of the envious
does me good.

1171
01:56:51,487 --> 01:56:56,078
Don't make me responsible
for the impotence of your friends.

1172
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:59,243
- Mr. Höfgen.
- Mr. Davidson, this is a surprise.

1173
01:57:14,686 --> 01:57:17,312
The check, please.

1174
01:57:18,454 --> 01:57:20,010
Have I come too early?

1175
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:22,584
Farewell, Barbara.

1176
01:57:25,354 --> 01:57:26,717
May I pa y?

1177
01:57:45,187 --> 01:57:46,914
What could I do here?

1178
01:57:59,387 --> 01:58:00,751
Freedom...

1179
01:58:02,354 --> 01:58:03,547
What for?

1180
01:59:24,686 --> 01:59:26,277
Oberon and Titania.

1181
01:59:31,886 --> 01:59:33,352
Congratulations!

1182
01:59:34,854 --> 01:59:41,446
I greet our wonderful and truly
tantalizing German bride and groom.

1183
01:59:41,554 --> 01:59:45,146
Two young, yet mature people...

1184
01:59:45,253 --> 01:59:49,708
...of purest race and noblest blood,
who have enchanted us...

1185
01:59:49,821 --> 01:59:54,718
...and who serve our new society!

1186
02:00:01,387 --> 02:00:04,251
- Thank you.
- All the best.

1187
02:00:11,721 --> 02:00:14,515
General, nice of you to come.

1188
02:00:14,953 --> 02:00:19,283
They can say what they want.
For me, the world is Grunewald.

1189
02:00:23,554 --> 02:00:28,884
I'll remain a German artist and patriot,
no matter who may rule my land.

1190
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:32,611
Grunewald is my favorite place...

1191
02:00:32,721 --> 02:00:35,949
...and what other country
brews such good beer?

1192
02:00:36,053 --> 02:00:38,645
Cäsar, nice to see you.

1193
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:46,375
You can hold your rehearsals
in this villa.

1194
02:00:47,953 --> 02:00:52,511
We're very proud of the way
you spoke in Paris.

1195
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:57,916
The way you simply answered
all the questions...

1196
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:03,248
...and said quite frankly and
honestly what it's like here.

1197
02:02:14,287 --> 02:02:16,220
Carry on dancing.

1198
02:02:17,854 --> 02:02:18,877
Good evening.

1199
02:02:20,821 --> 02:02:24,878
Now, that's a surprise!
I won't say no to that.

1200
02:02:36,153 --> 02:02:39,210
- Congratulations, my Mephisto.
- Thank you.

1201
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:44,911
Now, as old Admiral Tirpitz said:
"Target sighted! Full speed ahead!"

1202
02:02:45,021 --> 02:02:48,214
I'm looking forward to
your Hamlet, my Mephisto.

1203
02:02:49,586 --> 02:02:54,541
Your interview in Paris made a
good impression on all of us.

1204
02:02:56,886 --> 02:03:01,251
Congratulations!
And lots of healthy German boys!

1205
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:02,608
Thank you.

1206
02:03:06,153 --> 02:03:07,176
Madam?

1207
02:03:11,754 --> 02:03:12,845
Beautiful.

1208
02:03:19,487 --> 02:03:23,317
Yes, very much to my taste.

1209
02:03:37,287 --> 02:03:38,684
Very lovely.

1210
02:03:41,253 --> 02:03:42,718
Thank you, Madam.

1211
02:03:46,021 --> 02:03:47,043
Cheers!

1212
02:03:50,454 --> 02:03:52,942
We have no working hours, just work.

1213
02:03:53,921 --> 02:03:55,909
I'm sorry, I must go now.

1214
02:04:01,021 --> 02:04:04,611
Be happy together... Hamlet.

1215
02:06:11,121 --> 02:06:16,849
Lately I've been wondering whether
we actually deserve all this.

1216
02:06:17,586 --> 02:06:21,314
If I'm forced to answer,
then I must say "Yes."

1217
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:25,853
If not we, who represent
individuality and art...

1218
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:31,409
...who else should, can and must rise
above all that happens in the world?

1219
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:35,850
That's why we're an example
and encouragement to others.

1220
02:06:36,021 --> 02:06:38,713
No matter how filthy the world is...

1221
02:06:38,821 --> 02:06:44,185
...true art always remains pure
and true, doesn't it?

1222
02:06:44,287 --> 02:06:46,514
I'm married to the theater.

1223
02:06:47,586 --> 02:06:48,746
And so are you.

1224
02:06:49,754 --> 02:06:55,209
I can't contact Otto Ulrichs.
I sent a messenger to his flat...

1225
02:06:55,320 --> 02:07:02,185
...but he was told that two men
took Ulrichs away two days ago.

1226
02:07:15,021 --> 02:07:19,510
Call the Prime Minister and
connect me with him.

1227
02:07:21,053 --> 02:07:25,486
If he's not there, ask for an
appointment as soon as possible.

1228
02:07:27,786 --> 02:07:29,412
- Hello?
- Give it to me.

1229
02:07:30,953 --> 02:07:32,112
Höfgen.

1230
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:37,642
- Hello.
- Do come in.

1231
02:07:49,686 --> 02:07:52,175
- Hello.
- Do come in.

1232
02:07:58,287 --> 02:08:00,253
Well, what's going on?

1233
02:08:01,387 --> 02:08:04,910
Recently you helped me, on
behalf of a colleague.

1234
02:08:06,654 --> 02:08:08,779
Now I have to ask again for help.

1235
02:08:10,319 --> 02:08:11,615
The thing is...

1236
02:08:12,754 --> 02:08:19,846
...a few days ago, Otto Ulrichs
was taken from his apartment.

1237
02:08:21,487 --> 02:08:25,044
- Is this why you've come?
- Yes, Excellency.

1238
02:08:25,419 --> 02:08:30,909
I'm fed up with you, Höfgen. These
matters are outside your jurisdiction.

1239
02:08:31,519 --> 02:08:34,350
Keep your nose out of this affair.

1240
02:08:34,821 --> 02:08:38,014
I'll give you some good advice:
Stop meddling.

1241
02:08:38,121 --> 02:08:41,450
You'd do better minding
your own business...

1242
02:08:41,554 --> 02:08:46,452
...so you won't get crushed
like a bug! Think you matter?

1243
02:08:47,721 --> 02:08:49,778
Ulrichs was involved in dirty work.

1244
02:08:49,886 --> 02:08:54,546
My State Theater manager ought
not show such interest in a traitor.

1245
02:08:55,153 --> 02:08:56,176
Now go.

1246
02:08:56,686 --> 02:08:58,118
I told you to go.

1247
02:08:59,087 --> 02:09:01,212
Get out, actor!

1248
02:09:46,053 --> 02:09:50,247
I know how much I and the theater
owe to the General.

1249
02:09:50,354 --> 02:09:54,116
I also know that to a great
extent we owe it to you.

1250
02:09:54,287 --> 02:09:58,719
Dear Lotte, that's why I ask you
to intervene for Ulrichs.

1251
02:09:58,821 --> 02:10:03,116
- I'm so worried.
- Worried? But he's dead.

1252
02:10:03,619 --> 02:10:08,143
Didn't you know? As far as I know,
he committed suicide.

1253
02:10:11,219 --> 02:10:12,447
Suicide.

1254
02:10:15,319 --> 02:10:19,342
He knew the risks he ran.
I think he's more to be envied.

1255
02:11:01,721 --> 02:11:07,210
The Prince of Denmark
renounces rank, youth and love.

1256
02:11:07,354 --> 02:11:09,479
He is the savior of the North.

1257
02:11:09,586 --> 02:11:15,541
The lonely knight with lofty ideals,
the ideal of purity of blood and race.

1258
02:11:15,654 --> 02:11:20,177
Hamlet is a complex character, too.
A great and simple man.

1259
02:11:20,287 --> 02:11:25,049
Despite repeating myself so soon:
He is a man of the North.

1260
02:11:25,253 --> 02:11:30,685
He kills. And in his
self-destructing battle...

1261
02:11:32,219 --> 02:11:34,277
...he shows us the way to the future.

1262
02:11:34,387 --> 02:11:38,944
He commands us to lead a pure life.
That is his bequest to us today.

1263
02:11:39,053 --> 02:11:44,315
He is not weak, yet actors have
often portrayed him as neurotic...

1264
02:11:44,419 --> 02:11:49,442
...a pathological revolutionary,
thus as a decadent type.

1265
02:11:49,554 --> 02:11:51,850
Hamlet is a hard man.

1266
02:11:51,953 --> 02:11:57,715
You will see him as an
energetic, resolute hero.

1267
02:11:57,921 --> 02:12:03,944
He is also a hazard for the Germans.
We constantly analyze too much.

1268
02:12:04,053 --> 02:12:07,144
For the hour demands actions,
not only thoughts.

1269
02:12:07,253 --> 02:12:09,684
Least of all corruptive reflection.

1270
02:12:10,121 --> 02:12:15,451
Hamlet is the tragic conflict
between action and inaction.

1271
02:12:15,654 --> 02:12:19,642
Between hesitating,
thinking and doing.

1272
02:12:20,519 --> 02:12:24,713
And we, the bearers
of German culture...

1273
02:12:24,921 --> 02:12:27,386
...know what to make of that.

1274
02:12:27,721 --> 02:12:29,949
Hamlet is a populist drama.

1275
02:12:30,053 --> 02:12:33,850
Neither religious,
aristocratic, nor bourgeois...

1276
02:12:33,953 --> 02:12:36,351
...but a work like the Greek tragedies.

1277
02:12:36,454 --> 02:12:41,386
So we'll abolish the barrier
between audience and actor.

1278
02:12:41,886 --> 02:12:45,943
Space, light, movements,
sounds are everything...

1279
02:12:46,053 --> 02:12:50,952
...and even the spectators merge
into one great, common effect.

1280
02:12:51,319 --> 02:12:54,048
We must bring about total theater.

1281
02:12:54,454 --> 02:12:58,682
A theater that shocks and mobilizes.

1282
02:14:06,886 --> 02:14:10,841
It cost 60,000 marks to decorate
the theater for tonight...

1283
02:14:10,953 --> 02:14:13,852
...and five days loss of takings.

1284
02:14:13,953 --> 02:14:18,046
A nice birthday party. And we have
to participate in this circus.

1285
02:14:18,153 --> 02:14:20,142
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1286
02:15:08,754 --> 02:15:12,242
The only place you will find a
party like this is in Berlin.

1287
02:15:31,053 --> 02:15:34,281
Dearest Bella,
we haven't met in ages.

1288
02:15:34,387 --> 02:15:36,978
Are you well? Not homesick?

1289
02:15:37,087 --> 02:15:42,179
I'm sure you're fantastically well
and your great son is flourishing.

1290
02:15:51,619 --> 02:15:54,915
Dear Höfgen, how are you?
How is the party going?

1291
02:15:55,153 --> 02:15:56,847
People seem to enjoy it.

1292
02:15:56,953 --> 02:16:01,442
Your Hamlet was magnificent.
The boss was quite taken.

1293
02:16:01,554 --> 02:16:09,147
After the première he spoke
only of you and the theater.

1294
02:16:09,287 --> 02:16:12,878
Success is strange. Sometimes
you have it, sometimes not.

1295
02:16:12,986 --> 02:16:18,941
No, dear Höfgen, you give
people something, you create.

1296
02:16:21,387 --> 02:16:22,546
Here they come.

1297
02:17:53,419 --> 02:17:56,853
- How are you, Mephisto?
- Very well, Your Excellency.

1298
02:17:58,219 --> 02:18:01,617
I haven't told you, how wonderful
your Hamlet was.

1299
02:18:01,721 --> 02:18:04,653
I'm very glad.
Allow me to say a few words.

1300
02:18:05,854 --> 02:18:11,615
Mr. Prime Minister, Madam,
ladies and gentlemen.

1301
02:18:12,419 --> 02:18:19,683
We are proud to be able to celebrate
this day with you in this theater.

1302
02:18:19,921 --> 02:18:21,648
Since I have the honor...

1303
02:18:21,786 --> 02:18:24,651
...of greeting you on behalf
of everyone present...

1304
02:18:24,754 --> 02:18:28,879
...I salute the statesman and soldier...

1305
02:18:28,986 --> 02:18:32,475
...friend and generous
patron of the arts.

1306
02:18:33,854 --> 02:18:37,444
We admire him as our role model,
love him as our friend...

1307
02:18:37,586 --> 02:18:39,280
...obey him as our master...

1308
02:18:39,419 --> 02:18:43,580
...for without patrons,
art is a bird with broken wings.

1309
02:18:43,821 --> 02:18:47,548
As the poet says:
"May the gods protect you...

1310
02:18:47,654 --> 02:18:50,744
...and may the heart of Rome
beat for your aims".

1311
02:18:58,619 --> 02:19:03,881
The Prime Minister wishes to
speak to you outside, in his car.

1312
02:19:04,454 --> 02:19:05,714
You alone.

1313
02:19:09,686 --> 02:19:12,618
Nicoletta will take you home.
I won't be long.

1314
02:20:09,187 --> 02:20:12,812
Well, Mephisto, what power is
looking down on you here.

1315
02:20:13,219 --> 02:20:14,948
Do you feel it?

1316
02:20:15,786 --> 02:20:21,583
This is theater! Look at this arena.
It's almost ready. Wonderful, isn't it?

1317
02:20:22,354 --> 02:20:25,013
This is where
I'd stage a performance.

1318
02:20:25,886 --> 02:20:30,080
Don't blink, Hendrik, look history
in the eye. What an echo.

1319
02:20:32,654 --> 02:20:35,017
Hendrik Höfgen!

1320
02:20:38,354 --> 02:20:43,013
We shall rule Europe and the world.
A thousand-year empire.

1321
02:20:43,354 --> 02:20:46,149
Hendrik Höfgen!

1322
02:20:55,253 --> 02:20:57,810
Go! Get going!

1323
02:21:01,586 --> 02:21:02,780
Into the middle!

1324
02:21:21,187 --> 02:21:23,949
Well, how do you
enjoy this limelight?

1325
02:21:25,454 --> 02:21:27,612
This is the real light, isn't it?

1326
02:22:01,921 --> 02:22:05,114
What do they want of me? After all...

1327
02:22:05,921 --> 02:22:08,079
...I'm only an actor.
