1
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:09,494
<i>I'll give my heart just to one man</i>

2
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,469
<i>The greatest love since time began</i>

3
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,470
<i>He'll come my way and he'll be strong</i>

4
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,506
<i>And he will sing me love's sweet song...</i>

5
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,087
- What happened Mr. Höfgen?
- Who call you?

6
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,597
I don't need you now!
Go to hell!

7
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:48,312
We're invited to a boring banquet.
Sorry, but we have to leave now.

8
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:51,149
Can't you sit with us just some minutes, Dora?

9
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,688
No, we're much too late.

10
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:55,656
Sorry, good evening.

11
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,557
I just wanted to say you were marvelous tonight.

12
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:01,826
It was fantastic. Thank God I saw it.

13
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:07,495
You liar! You didn't even see the show.
Never mind, I`ve hear you're talented.

14
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:10,038
Me? Talented? 
Say it louder, please.

15
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:14,441
Yes, you're very talented, Herr Höfgen.

16
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:19,282
I'm sure you'll soon be able to show
just how talented you are.

17
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,779
I must be going, goodbye.

18
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:36,988
- Böck, seven marks.
- But Hendrik,

19
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,533
if you need money
I can lend you fifty marks.

20
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:44,569
This is men's business.
Böck likes giving money. There we go.

21
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,702
Good evening, Miklas.
Thank you.

22
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:51,101
Right!

23
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,241
<i>If it was for Dr. Kroge, 
I`ll die of hunger.</i>

24
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,321
Höfgen, you old sinner!
Take a seat.

25
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:04,688
Well, Director,
how'd you like the show?

26
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,162
What's getting you down, Hendrik?

27
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,795
That I'm a provincial actor.

28
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,330
Is that all? Nothing else?

29
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:47,092
Good day.

30
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:51,528
You're late.

31
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:56,738
One day, I'll come to fetch you.

32
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,133
Don't you dread that, Heinz?

33
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:02,941
- Please don't call me Heinz.
- Why not? That's your name.

34
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,876
I dislike it. Understand?

35
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:09,418
I understand all, Heinz.

36
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:14,457
You can't even drink a beer 
like a man who feels like drinking one.

37
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,548
Shall we start?

38
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,821
What was that about beer?

39
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:22,892
It's not your style,
simply to call for a beer.

40
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,334
"A beer, please" sounds phony when you say it.

41
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,503
You know I don't drink, Juliette.

42
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:32,698
I know, Heinz. Take your shoes off.

43
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,826
What is it?

44
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:58,392
Don`t stand there like you`ve stained your pants.

45
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:43,433
One, two...

46
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,167
One, two, three, four...

47
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,473
On one.

48
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,045
Don't fall down now.

49
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,584
Faster!

50
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,952
Faster!
Show me what you can do.

51
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:42,555
You want to be an actor
and show off for money, too?

52
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,270
You comical picture of misery.

53
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,090
That`s it!

54
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,137
Oh God!

55
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,115
If you liked the music,
you wouldn't get tired.

56
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,749
You always laugh at me, Juliette.
Always!

57
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:17,597
I can't cry. 
Would you love me if I could cry?

58
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,532
I love you anyway.

59
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:24,538
You only love yourself, Heinz,
and even then not enough.

60
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:28,741
Keep talking.
I like hearing you.

61
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,185
You never listen to me.

62
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:34,714
Your only concern is your face 
being devoid of human expression.

63
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,444
It's a mask, you hear?

64
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:43,388
I, too, have skin and bones and body weight,

65
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:46,824
and eyebrows and fingernails,
just like you.

66
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:54,599
I, too, feel the cold.
I can be hungry and thirsty.

67
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,465
I, too, think of my mother.

68
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,233
And I know there are Philistines and Communists.

69
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,638
But my eyes are not my eyes.

70
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:11,576
My legs are not my legs!
My face is not my face!

71
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:16,950
My name is not my name,
because I am an actor!

72
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:21,554
Do you know what it means to be an actor?

73
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:26,364
An actor is a mask...

74
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,191
among human beings.

75
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:33,004
Come! Come!

76
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:45,609
Juliette!

77
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:49,115
Juliette!

78
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,497
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have the honor

79
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:48,269
of welcoming you 
to the first reading of the play.

80
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:54,544
But before that, may I introduce our guest,
Nicoletta von Niebuhr,

81
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:58,675
who will play the female lead 
in this production.

82
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,020
Do you mind if my friend watches the rehearsal?

83
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:10,761
I have no objection.

84
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:16,700
- Two cognacs and one absinte.
- Yes, Mr. Director.

85
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,173
Coming up right away, Director.

86
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:21,864
- Three beers, please.
- Right.

87
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,399
There you go,
two cognacs and one absinte.

88
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,172
Thank you. 
To a good collaboration.

89
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,109
Now, please excuse me.

90
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,317
- A beer?
- Yes, a beer please.

91
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:35,203
Right.

92
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,019
The old Hansemann...

93
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:39,648
Hendrik, will we look lovely in this play?

94
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:40,850
We are lovely.

95
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,521
May I introduce my best friend,
Barbara Bruckner?

96
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,961
Nice to meet you.

97
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:47,387
What?

98
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,161
There's a nice smell of lavender about you.

99
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,860
Can you smell the lavender, too?

100
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:57,769
How shocking, on a man.
But I need it like my daily bread.

101
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,141
A little on the temples 
is as good as a night's sleep.

102
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:05,113
Sleep would be better, 
but there's no time.

103
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,884
A beer and a mineral water.

104
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,611
We'll hear what the old man has to say,

105
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:15,658
use the good bits, then play it our way.

106
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:18,657
He's good, but old-fashioned.

107
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:21,732
The future of Hamburg Art Theater is me.

108
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,800
I mean the two of us, naturally.

109
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:31,505
But most of the plays here
are shallow bourgeois stuff.

110
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:35,809
But Otto and I visualize theater
that will involve everyone,

111
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,210
like the workers, the dockers.

112
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:40,873
Where will you perform this theater?

113
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,711
It doesn't matter.
In the docks, in the factories, in cellars.

114
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:48,256
Hendrik, they asked me about the play.
We promised it for last week.

115
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:51,292
Let's get this opening night over first.

116
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,188
To prove that theater has a 
political responsability is difficult.

117
00:14:56,332 --> 00:15:01,565
Before it can be political or revolutionary, 
it first has to be good.

118
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,194
Which actors will be in this sort of theater?

119
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,502
All who think like us. Even workers.

120
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,772
It's what we say, not how we say it.

121
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:14,871
But I've no qualms if Hendrik stages our plays.

122
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,014
Why are you looking at me?

123
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,388
Am I not allowed to?

124
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:24,151
If it pleases you, go ahead.

125
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,011
Without you, I'll be finished, Barbara.

126
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,752
There's too much evil in me.

127
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:34,615
Alone, I'm too weak to overcome it,
but you could help me to fortify my good side.

128
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:42,893
I can't talk anymore. 
So many thoughts are just parts I've played.

129
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,000
I love you, Barbara.

130
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:15,129
I'm in love. With a woman.

131
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:20,166
Juliette, am I a good looking man?

132
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:24,667
I've never seen you on stage.
Maybe you're handsome,

133
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:29,004
but frankly, 
I've never found you good looking, 

134
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:34,444
but sometimes your cold cheating eyes
are those of a sad child.

135
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,380
You do it well.

136
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:41,448
Who have you fallen for?

137
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:44,347
- A girl.
- Great!

138
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,822
You falling in love...

139
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:50,555
One day you may just learn how to walk, 
not just dance.

140
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:56,199
Love the girl, Heinz, 
and don't tell me anything about her.

141
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:01,933
- Do we keep in touch?
- Yes.

142
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:06,073
You know what? I'm coming with you.

143
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,837
I have nothing to lose, Heinz.

144
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,693
Are you crazy?

145
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,073
See a psychiatrist, Heinz.

146
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:45,145
Though I'm sure 
you wouldn't dare talk about yourself.

147
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:50,649
Go, Heinz. We'll meet soon anyway...

148
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,280
even if you don't want to.

149
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:57,525
Excuse me grandmother, have you a moment?

150
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,860
- I'd like to introduce...
- Your fiancé.

151
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:07,368
I have to take a closer look
at my new grandson.

152
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,473
Not bad at all.

153
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,674
My mother send her apologies,
she will be here shortly.

154
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:25,213
I assume you know, my dear Höfgen,

155
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:32,323
that loving mothers rarely want 
their only sons to leave the nest.

156
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:38,330
Good day, Sebastian.

157
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:40,127
That is Sebastian.

158
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:48,969
Mom.

159
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,516
Yes.

160
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,744
I'm pleased.
I'm really pleased.

161
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,914
Barbara, my dear child.

162
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,814
I'm Nicoletta von Niebuhr,
the adoptive daughter of the house,

163
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:07,452
the bride's best friend,
almost her sister.

164
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:14,592
Often, the bridegroom's mistress.
Only on stage, of course.

165
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:17,464
May I call you Aunt Bella?

166
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:19,936
But of course, Nicoletta.

167
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:29,607
Come Höfgen,
let us leave the ladies to themselves.

168
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:33,448
I'd like to show you my garden.

169
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:36,521
I'd love to see it.

170
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:42,579
Have you unsettling memories?

171
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:48,817
You know, Barbara, memories that give you the creeps 
when you think about them?

172
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:56,458
When I was about twelve,
I got into our school choir.

173
00:21:56,598 --> 00:22:02,935
I was overjoyed. 
I thought I could sing better than the other boys.

174
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,333
We had to sing in church at some wedding.

175
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:16,007
I wanted to show off.
I was so proud of my soprano voice.

176
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,348
I had a great idea. 
I sang one octave higher than the others.

177
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:23,523
As I stood there, proudly singing,

178
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:29,586
the music teacher looked at me
more in disgust than disapproval,

179
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,631
and he said softly,
"Just keep quiet."

180
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,423
Do you understand?

181
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:39,165
Softly and dryly he said,
"Just keep quiet."

182
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:42,673
When I felt I was singing like an angel.

183
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:45,444
Do you have such memories?

184
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:48,603
No.

185
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:54,447
You've never felt ashamed in your life.

186
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,716
I often have. That was the first time.

187
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:02,819
I often have to feel awfully ashamed of myself.

188
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:07,095
So ashamed, I could sink down into hell.

189
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,061
Do you understand me?

190
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:16,704
This is the basement room.
The window faces the street.

191
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:21,973
Here's a lamp post and here, too.
Behind it the bakery,

192
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,946
- with workers' wives lined up.
- Stop!

193
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:27,909
Prima!

194
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,247
Ms. Schult, you come up past the window.

195
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:35,655
Barbara, can you put a lamp post here,

196
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:39,489
with a light to dazzle the audience?

197
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:45,192
You come here and begin with the widow`s monologue:
"I'm widow Queck who hasn't paid the rent."

198
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:51,137
Barbara, we could have several more 
lamp posts in the middle of the auditorium,

199
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:56,177
so people feel they're really in their filthy street.

200
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:02,148
We'll have posters, recent political slogans, 
all jumbled up.

201
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:08,254
At the back, a grocer's shop,
with nothing to sell, of course.

202
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:12,691
Everything in the hall 
must express what we talk about!

203
00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:18,163
And two policemen can patrol the rows
and stare at the audience.

204
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:23,704
An end to passive watching, 
actors and public isolated from each other.

205
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:29,801
The public must play an active part.
The days of the peepshow are over!

206
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,438
The actor with is text,
is only one element of the performance,

207
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:35,482
not it's focal point.

208
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:41,748
The hall, lights, walls, movements, sounds, 
all must blend into a whole!

209
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:47,487
Only then shall we have real theater.
The workers need total theater!

210
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:51,121
One that shocks and arouses!

211
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:54,093
I am the widow Queck, who cannot pay the rent. 

212
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:58,497
My husband died and I am a servant of the baker, 
the owner of this house.

213
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:01,838
It's the only way I can feed
my seven hungry children.

214
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:04,876
Wait! Wait!
The half-hour has to be paid for.

215
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:07,969
At your orders, 
we've been waiting half an hour.

216
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,980
Here reigns logic and hunger.

217
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,078
Yes, I already owe you 31 marks and 25 pfennigs.

218
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:20,122
I've had nothing.
In these last days, I couldn`t even...

219
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,185
Silly goose!

220
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:27,221
Sabotaging our work!
Do you think I don't know why?

221
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:32,497
Miklas or one of his damn party friends 
has put you up to it!

222
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:36,232
- What do you want from me?
- Why don't you prompt her?!

223
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:43,270
Never mind! Revolutionary Theatre
can't be staged with provincials.

224
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:47,009
With amateurs, you can't create any sort of theatre.

225
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:50,553
Even revolutions need professionals!

226
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:58,990
I'll buy you a drink to celebrate
the failure of the Revolutionary Theater.

227
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:01,997
You're beside yourself with joy.

228
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:06,725
Good day.
 

229
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:08,227
Good day.

230
00:26:08,604 --> 00:26:10,538
Two stiff ones, Hansemann.

231
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:18,709
How about another rebellious evening?

232
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:24,550
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

233
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,446
What, me?

234
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,189
- Good morning.
- Morning.

235
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:34,089
You're still half asleep.

236
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,992
I'm awake.

237
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:43,103
I've even phoned our grocer, 
he's a bit impatient over our large bill.

238
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:48,741
I'm sorry. I don't present a picture 
of early morning freshness.

239
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:55,740
If I, too, went riding every morning,
I'd probably look more attractive.

240
00:26:56,417 --> 00:27:00,217
But in our circles,
such noble sport is not customary.

241
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:03,779
The offended husband, as in Moliére.

242
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,653
Oh, be quiet!

243
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,657
It's not customary to sit all night
at a National Socialist thug's table.

244
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:16,825
- Miklas is not a thug.
- All National Socialists are thugs!

245
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:22,974
You must avoid their company.
Their dirt rubs off on you.

246
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:29,810
It`s a pity you can't understand. 
It's your family's well known liberalism.

247
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:36,013
No political beliefs, just curiosity.
For you ideologies are psychological quirks.

248
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,385
I feel sorry for Miklas. 
He gets small parts and earns very little.

249
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:46,157
You all treat him very badly. 
He's at a loss, that's why he's with them.

250
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,295
So much understanding for that lousy brat.

251
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,859
How do you think they'd treat us
if they came to power?

252
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,132
God forbid!

253
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,973
And yet you sit and chat with him, Barbara.
It's your bourgeois tolerance.

254
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,673
This understanding of one's enemy.

255
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:09,650
I'm sure you could even excuse Fascist terrorism.

256
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:13,884
Your liberalism might even get used to dictatorship.

257
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:15,618
No, thank you.

258
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,857
May I remark, my love,

259
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,420
it's common practice to eat an egg
from its shell and with salt.

260
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:26,662
I know, in the Bruckner household
you eat it from a glass

261
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,761
with six spices, and that's very original,

262
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:35,504
but no need to make fun 
of those unaccustomed to such originality.

263
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:53,721
- Who's juvenile lead in Halberstadt?
- Herbert Boltz.

264
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:56,193
Where's Ms. Türkheim-Gawernitz now?

265
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,491
Strangely in Heidelberg.

266
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,066
- And Hannelore Kühn.
- In Mannheim.

267
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:03,068
- And who's Othello there?
- Max Krause.

268
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:05,365
- And Iago?
- Johannes Fiedler.

269
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:08,339
- And Desdemona in Leipzig?
- Kathe Müttel.

270
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,171
Who's the ingénue in Jena?

271
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:13,041
A stupid cow called Lotte Lindenthal.

272
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:17,440
Why is Lotte Lindenthal a stupid cow?

273
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:19,652
I don't know, but she is.

274
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:22,654
I know why you insult her.

275
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:26,317
She's the friend of a National Socialist leader.

276
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:32,594
I'm only moderately interested
in the names and titles of her lovers.

277
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:36,431
Must be quite a long list...

278
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:38,299
Watch your tongue, Höfgen!

279
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:46,902
I don´t allow you insult a lady 
because she's in the Nazi German worker's party,

280
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,410
and the friend of a German hero.

281
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,107
You won't stand for it?

282
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,118
My, my...

283
00:29:57,723 --> 00:29:59,986
Stop it! You're drunk!

284
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,155
I'm not. On the contrary.

285
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:09,058
Apparently I'm the only one here
with a spark of honor left.

286
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:13,228
Nobody in this Jew-ridden business cares 
if a lady is insulted!

287
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:16,270
Let go of me!

288
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,464
No!

289
00:30:19,315 --> 00:30:22,809
- Hans, calm yourself.
- Leave me!

290
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:28,712
I'll gladly believe you're not drunk.

291
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:32,952
So you won't make that an excuse, then.

292
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:36,026
As for this Jew-ridden business you're in,

293
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,492
you won't suffer it much longer.

294
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:41,528
That I promise you.

295
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,662
Perhaps you're right.

296
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:49,028
I agree, the fellow's behavior was intolerable,

297
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:53,336
but I can't just fire a poor,
sick man like that.

298
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,000
Sick? He's not sick at all.

299
00:30:56,246 --> 00:31:02,047
Why this indecision and compromise?
It's just like our government parties.

300
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,643
Excuse me, Barbara.

301
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:08,746
We must show this murderous pack 
it can't get away with it.

302
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:12,257
I beg you, don't insist 
that he be sacked on the spot.

303
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:17,355
It's punishment enough 
that he won't be hired for the next season.

304
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:21,696
He has no idea what he said last night, 
he just went wild.

305
00:31:21,802 --> 00:31:23,394
I'm amazed, Otto.

306
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:29,736
I'm really amazed that you,
of all people, should say that.

307
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:33,371
I don't want him made a martyr.

308
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:37,606
- In the political situation...
- Excuse me if I interrupt.

309
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:43,451
This interesting but theoretical discussion is useless.
The case is simple, it`s him or me.

310
00:31:43,556 --> 00:31:48,289
Either Miklas leaves the theater...

311
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:50,829
or I do.

312
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,830
Don`t say nonsense.

313
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:57,631
Don`t worry Höfgen, we will dismiss him.

314
00:32:48,752 --> 00:32:50,379
Higher, higher!

315
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:56,890
Enough! This isn't a funeral march!

316
00:32:57,994 --> 00:32:59,325
Again.

317
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:03,392
Lights!

318
00:33:41,368 --> 00:33:42,700
Sorry to interrupt.

319
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:46,068
Dr. Kroge asks you to approve the poster
for the next premiere.

320
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,869
I must take it to the printer.

321
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:56,873
Can't I get my name spelled correctly 
even in this theatre?

322
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,582
My name is not Henrik, but Hendrik!

323
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:04,983
Hendrik Höfgen.

324
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:08,019
One day they'll all have to mark my name.

325
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,893
Try to understand, Dr. Kroge.
I can't and won't tie myself down.

326
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:19,370
It's a great strain to stay under contract.

327
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:21,372
I must be free. Free!

328
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:25,835
I can't be a provincial matinee idol.

329
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:28,672
No, no, I don't want to be that.

330
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,715
You want to leave Hamburg for good?

331
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,978
I don't know yet.

332
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:44,553
The Professor invited me to a Berlin guest appearance. 
One never knows.

333
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:47,628
By the way, Dora Martin will be my partner.

334
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:51,663
Good. Then accept the offer.

335
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:54,693
Thank you.

336
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:59,135
Berlin!

337
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:06,633
Thank you, ladies. Till tomorrow.

338
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:08,140
Goodbye.

339
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,812
So you are Höfgen.

340
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,144
You have friends here.

341
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:23,450
Some of them, who understand theater, 
have recommended you.

342
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:30,655
Your father-in-law, too,
when we met at the ministry of culture.

343
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:35,597
And now also Dora Martin, as well.

344
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:47,902
In real life I may seem a bit nondescript, 
but not, I hope, on stage.

345
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:54,342
My father-in-law once aptly described 
my ability to transform myself.

346
00:36:55,987 --> 00:37:01,289
Well, we'll give you a try.

347
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:10,132
Don't expect too much.
I'm not offering anything big.

348
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:16,399
You are probably used 
to a reasonable income in Hamburg.

349
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:21,273
Here you'll have less.
Have you expensive tastes?

350
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:27,143
Money doesn't interest me.
My needs are modest.

351
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:32,581
All I need every day is a clean shirt
and a drop of cologne.

352
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:37,459
Discuss the details with Miss Bernhardt.

353
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:41,428
Please give my regards to your father-in-law.

354
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:45,694
- Hendrik Höfgen.
- Oh, yes. Bernhardt.

355
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:47,828
Here's your contract.

356
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:49,095
Thank you.

357
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:52,200
- May I?
- Please.

358
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,578
700 marks a month, less tax.
You agree to play as cast.

359
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,011
So...

360
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:16,553
Please give these flowers...

361
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:21,530
and this card to Ms. Martin.

362
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:24,591
Will you?

363
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:25,900
THANKS!

364
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,987
Well, Hendrik Höfgen.

365
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:50,889
Now you're a beginner again.

366
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,061
Hamburg's fame, routine and security 
all lie behind you.

367
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:01,604
Now you must summon up all your strength.

368
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:13,807
And we'll work off that blubber.

369
00:40:42,537 --> 00:40:46,303
- Who is that?
- Dora Martin's Hamburg actor lover.

370
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:50,137
- No, Miss Bernhardt's.
- You're misinformed, dear.

371
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,443
So glad you were able to come,
despite all your work.

372
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:58,510
May I introduce some of your admirers?

373
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:03,988
Mr. Davidson of the London Times.
Caser von Muck, Mr. Müller-Andrea.

374
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:24,240
Mind you aren't influenced by the prevailing 
culture Bolshevism which reins in Kurfürstendamm.

375
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:25,934
What do you mean?

376
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:31,716
German culture can only be renewed
if it returns to its national roots,

377
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:34,250
to its essence of blood and soil.

378
00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:40,382
Russian ravings or French farces 
are alien to the spirit the nation needs.

379
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,809
Lenie! 
Have you met Mr. Höfgen?

380
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:07,246
Berlin's new star,
according to tomorrow's London Times.

381
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,342
I've seen you on stage.
You danced, didn't you?

382
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:15,117
Yes, I like dancing.
I had a good teacher.

383
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:18,087
You`ve an outstanding head.
I'd like to model it.

384
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:27,524
<i>No necktie and no gold we've got
We're just a very shabby lot</i>

385
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:31,463
<i>At which the bourgeois spits</i>

386
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,036
<i>The bourgeois with polished boots
And medals on morning suits</i>

387
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:41,275
<i>And every morning he ablutes
for church, or for the Ritz</i>

388
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,814
<i>Where does the bourgeois get it all?
His guns, his celebration ball?</i>

389
00:42:49,056 --> 00:42:51,752
<i>He steals it where he can</i>

390
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:56,286
<i>He makes it hard for us to rob
Takes it all, the greedy slob</i>

391
00:42:56,397 --> 00:43:01,300
<i>Exploits the poor and wrecks the job
of every working man</i>

392
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:09,635
<i>Oh, if so wealthy I could be,
Commit like him grand larceny</i>

393
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:12,575
<i>All honored since my birth</i>

394
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:18,750
<i>If then I met someone I knew,
You filthy lot, I'd spit at you</i>

395
00:43:18,852 --> 00:43:24,721
<i>That's all you dogs are worth!</i>

396
00:43:30,862 --> 00:43:33,889
Out! Out of here!
You jewish pig!

397
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:39,076
- Go away!
- Alright!

398
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,409
They are completely drunk.

399
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:56,146
Now one of the most famous State Theater actors, 
Hendrik Höfgen.

400
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:05,151
Forget State Theater and fame.
I am your comrade Hendrik Höfgen.

401
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:14,861
<i>What does the proletariat want?
That nobody should rule!</i>

402
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:21,508
<i>What does the proletariat want?
That nobody should rule!</i>

403
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:27,149
<i>Nobody shall give orders
Nobody shall be a slave</i>

404
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:32,287
<i>Freedom, equality for all souls</i>

405
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:35,556
I'll dictate. Headline:

406
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:42,294
Actor Höfgen wins Berlin workers' hearts overnight.

407
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:44,193
New paragraph.

408
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:47,627
- Hendrik?
- Hello.

409
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:54,536
I went to an antique dealer in Woltersdorf. 
I bought this picture at some other things. 

410
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:56,972
- You don't mind?
- Why should I mind?

411
00:44:57,178 --> 00:45:00,273
I going to change, then you can admire it.

412
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:41,210
I love you, Barbara. 
Not only your father and grandmother.

413
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:44,289
I love you... I, Hendrik Höfgen.

414
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:02,801
Welcome to my home, my dear Sebastian.

415
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,796
Unfortunately, the theater awaits me,

416
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:09,567
but when I came back, we can talk...

417
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,325
The three of us!

418
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,504
Up! 

419
00:47:20,514 --> 00:47:21,606
Two!

420
00:47:22,284 --> 00:47:23,375
Three!

421
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:25,076
Four!

422
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,677
Five!

423
00:47:26,854 --> 00:47:27,878
Six!

424
00:47:28,122 --> 00:47:32,149
Führer!
We are our people's strength!

425
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:35,023
We shall create a new world!

426
00:47:35,196 --> 00:47:37,994
- What's your father's job?
- Road digger!

427
00:47:38,132 --> 00:47:40,066
- And your father's?
- Farmer!

428
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:43,466
- And yours?
- Teacher. He educates us!

429
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,165
- And your father?
- Baker. He bakes our bread!

430
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:49,901
Mine's a miller. He grinds our grain!

431
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,068
A doctor. He makes us healthy!

432
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:54,237
Bricklayer. He builds our houses!

433
00:47:54,347 --> 00:47:56,178
- Conductor!
- Electrician!

434
00:47:56,282 --> 00:48:00,547
We are the sons of one people,
we all have the same goal!

435
00:48:00,653 --> 00:48:03,486
Unity and strength!
We follow the Führer!

436
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,858
No. That's not convincing enough.
Say it like this...

437
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,854
We are the sons of one people,
we all have the same goal!

438
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:13,763
Unity and strength!
We follow the Führer!

439
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:17,198
- Again... one, two, three.
- Unity and strength!

440
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:18,360
Again!

441
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,404
Unity and strength!

442
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:23,473
- Louder! Again!
- Unity and strength!

443
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:24,972
We follow the Führer!

444
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:30,537
Blood is a very special juice...

445
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:38,484
let us in depths of sensuousness
assuage our burning passions.

446
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,921
No bounds and goals are set for you.

447
00:48:42,026 --> 00:48:45,825
You find your pleasure.
A fleeing treasure.

448
00:48:45,963 --> 00:48:51,923
May you enjoy the prize you get.
Help yourself and don't be coy.

449
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:54,595
But listen, it's not a question of joy.

450
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:58,162
To knowledge I'm devoted,
most painful gratification.

451
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:01,210
Most hateful love,
most vexing stimulation.

452
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:07,909
Believe me, who a thousand years
on this hard nourishment has fed.

453
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:14,217
That from cradle to the grave, 
no human can digest so stale a bread.

454
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,656
Believe me, worlds celestial and infernal

455
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:21,594
for one divinity were made.

456
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:24,825
He exists in eternal light.

457
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:30,234
But us, into the darkness conveyed, 
there's day and night alone.

458
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:31,601
Yet I want that!

459
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,006
That's well worth hearing.
But there's one thing I fear.

460
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:39,978
For time is short, but art is long.

461
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:44,814
If I thought you sought more teaching,
cultivate a poet fond of preaching.

462
00:49:44,986 --> 00:49:47,078
Let his thoughts wander.

463
00:49:47,188 --> 00:49:50,749
And every noble quality 
upon your brow let him bestow,

464
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:53,520
the lion's courage,
the buck's swiftness.

465
00:49:53,627 --> 00:49:56,755
The Italian's fiery blood,
the north's enduring pluck.

466
00:49:56,864 --> 00:50:00,993
He'll teach you the secret vile 
of magnanimity steeped in guile.

467
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:06,003
May his youthful drives uncover
to make of you an ardent lover.

468
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:14,445
I'd like to meet a scholar of such fame,
to Microcosm I'd change his name.

469
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,748
So what am I, if it's not possible
the paragon of humanity to attain,

470
00:50:20,853 --> 00:50:22,878
towards all my senses strain?

471
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:27,425
You're in the end just what you are.

472
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:31,495
Put on the wigs of a million curls.

473
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:36,195
Put your feet in elevating socks.

474
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:41,505
You'll stay for ever what you are!

475
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,527
Bravo!

476
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,893
Wonderful!
You were fantastic, Hendrik.

477
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,667
You were born to play Mephisto.

478
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,337
You say that with a touch of malice, Dora.

479
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:25,505
Not true, I don't detest people 
for what they are.

480
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:29,710
- Anyway, thank you for coming.
- Let's skip the cliches.

481
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:33,410
- What's your next project?
- I'm learning English.

482
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:35,387
English? Why?

483
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:39,517
- I'll be working in America.
- In America? But why?

484
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:43,027
Here the curtain's descending.
Haven't you noticed?

485
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:49,400
You're at the top here, hit after hit.
Thousands adore you. So why go?

486
00:51:49,503 --> 00:51:53,463
The love of thousands! 
Soon they'll be raving about others.

487
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:59,312
Dora, there'll always be theater,
no matter what happens in Germany.

488
00:51:59,613 --> 00:52:03,140
No matter what happens in Germany?
You really mean that?

489
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,957
Well, all the best, Hendrik.

490
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,290
You`ll not see me for a long time.
I'm leaving in a few days.

491
00:52:11,459 --> 00:52:13,949
In a few days?

492
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:16,585
I don't want to wait till it's too late.

493
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:19,764
But you'll always do well, 
Hendrik Höfgen,

494
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,797
no matter what happens in Germany.

495
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:33,574
It's open.

496
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:42,046
Mephisto, I never lock the door.
Need neither bolts nor life insurance.

497
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:46,317
- I bet you've already made one.
- I need no life insurance.

498
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:49,690
Sit down, sir, in my new home.

499
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:53,090
You could have gotten me a nicer flat.

500
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,896
- Have you registered?
- Yes, sir.

501
00:52:58,002 --> 00:53:00,767
What did the landlord say?

502
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:05,070
Nothing. He was drunk, humming a song...

503
00:53:05,176 --> 00:53:07,701
"No neckties, no gold..."

504
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:11,578
He gave me the key and I moved in.

505
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:19,688
I've been longing to see you.

506
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:25,888
- And how's your wife?
- She's with her father, thank God.

507
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:30,899
They're worried about the Republic.

508
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:44,309
In Hamburg, the foreigners 
were also very worried about Germany,

509
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:49,007
about German culture,
whose Number-One-Parrot you are.

510
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:53,919
As if a peril threatened it. 
What are the Jews planning against Germany?

511
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,457
Everyone talks about them.
Even the whores wonder,

512
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,723
and they don't care about the pant color 
as long as it has a fly.

513
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:04,664
Barbara understands politics, doesn't she?

514
00:54:05,066 --> 00:54:07,125
Is she keeping an eye on you?

515
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:13,005
No. Mostly her opinions
are the opposite of mine.

516
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:17,339
- Have you told her so?
- No. What point would there be?

517
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:20,405
Words don't say everything.

518
00:54:22,749 --> 00:54:27,847
I'd like very much to sleep with you.

519
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:30,453
Shall I make up the bed?

520
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:32,314
Yes!

521
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:38,564
Hendrik! Hendrik!

522
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:44,068
Hendrik, wake up! Get up!

523
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,434
You're here already?

524
00:54:46,572 --> 00:54:49,097
I came on the early train,
because of you.

525
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:52,609
- What's the matter?
- When did you go to bed?

526
00:54:52,878 --> 00:54:56,507
I'm tired. I was tossing all night.
Why?

527
00:54:56,615 --> 00:55:00,484
The National Socialists have won the elections.
You know who became Chancellor?

528
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:01,643
No.

529
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:08,356
Do you hear that?

530
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:11,356
Do you hear that?

531
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:19,437
That Bohemian corporal has become Chancellor?

532
00:55:19,536 --> 00:55:20,902
Here, read it!

533
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:25,338
I thought there was nothing to fear 
from the National Socialists.

534
00:55:27,112 --> 00:55:30,376
- Remember that business with Miklas?
- I don`t have friends between them.

535
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:38,221
That could have unpleasant consequences. 
What do we do now?

536
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:44,716
Keep a clear mind and don't panic.

537
00:55:45,795 --> 00:55:50,756
So, the Austrian clown has become Reichs-Chancellor.

538
00:55:52,135 --> 00:55:57,198
But there still is the opposition, no?
Communists and Social Democrats.

539
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,775
They'll make sure 
he doesn't get too big for his boots.

540
00:56:02,077 --> 00:56:05,808
Perhaps there'll even be armed resistance.

541
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:14,546
And even if the National Socialists stay in power,
why should it concern me?

542
00:56:14,656 --> 00:56:16,180
I'm from the Rhineland.

543
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:20,489
So are my parents.
What can happen to us?

544
00:56:20,629 --> 00:56:24,030
On top of that, I'm an actor. No?

545
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:30,767
I go to the theater, play my parts and well,
then go back home. That's all!

546
00:56:30,872 --> 00:56:34,308
But some people can see the consequences,

547
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:38,276
and are leaving the country,
where a career in the arts is now impossible.

548
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:42,974
People will think you don't care
about anything beyond the limelight?

549
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:47,918
There were elections in a democratic state. 
One party won, that's all.

550
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:52,981
I've never been interested in politics, 
so why now?

551
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:56,254
Don't you realize what's happening here?

552
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:04,163
Don't answer it. I'm not here, I'm sick!
Say what you want.

553
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,308
Hendrik, is that the solution? 
To lock yourself in, to hide, not be at home? 

554
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,891
To run!
To not answer the phone?

555
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,599
Is that all you can think of,
instead of taking a definite stand?

556
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,803
Definite? Definite? 
This is my answer!

557
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,871
- No, I don`t accept that.
- Hamlet! Shakespeare!

558
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:25,846
Either we take a stand or go,
if our freedom is in danger!

559
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:30,019
This is the only form of freedom for me, 
for an actor.

560
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:33,790
You can't hide behind Shakespeare,
on the stage!

561
00:57:33,899 --> 00:57:39,302
Barbara, I'm an actor!
An actor in Germany at all times.

562
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:42,372
You can go away.
Your father is a famous writer.

563
00:57:42,473 --> 00:57:46,068
You can design sets anywhere,
or buy antiques.

564
00:57:46,177 --> 00:57:49,112
But I need the German language!

565
00:57:49,213 --> 00:57:53,376
I need the motherland, don't you see?

566
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,964
- Who's there?
- Otto.

567
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,628
- Who?
- Otto.

568
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,538
- I must talk to you.
- You want some coffee?

569
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:22,305
- No, thanks.
- Tea?

570
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:27,508
Act with us again. It's the only reply
we can give to these events.

571
00:58:27,616 --> 00:58:31,609
An appearance by all of us,
a common front.

572
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:34,120
So we don't lose our future.

573
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:39,353
You just want to divide the audience?
We must work out our tactics.

574
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:42,054
Tactics will force us to our knees.

575
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:45,155
We must fight this crushing demagogy.

576
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:52,296
It's our job to tell the hesitators:
Now is the time to resist dictatorship!

577
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,374
Otto, in the first place, we're actors...

578
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:57,603
No, not a protest on the street.
I'm talking about the stage.

579
00:58:57,811 --> 00:59:00,541
Still, I think we should wait a few days.

580
00:59:00,682 --> 00:59:03,207
We must do something immediately. 
Tonight.

581
00:59:05,919 --> 00:59:10,049
Otto, I'd rather stay with the reserves.

582
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:21,228
Thank God I've no performance today.

583
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:31,601
GERMAN REICHS-MAIL

584
00:59:38,985 --> 00:59:42,511
Film contract, locations in Budapest...

585
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:48,250
leading role.
Production Manager Altenburger.

586
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,126
She really is a beauty.
She's sitting by the side altar.

587
00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:03,229
Cut! Very good.
The second one.

588
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:10,371
Now the scene where the officials
follow her to the Fishermen's Bastion.

589
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:22,792
What it is?

590
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,655
What's going on?

591
01:00:24,995 --> 01:00:26,894
Are we done for today?
Can we go home?

592
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:29,965
- The Reichstag was burned down!
- What?

593
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:34,229
They say the communists set fire to it.

594
01:00:43,946 --> 01:00:47,076
Your wife wants you to join her in Paris.

595
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,279
She didn't dare phone you from Berlin.

596
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:53,683
Don't go back to Berlin. 
I`m moving to Vienna myself.

597
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:58,615
Many of your Berlin friends have vanished lately. 
Otto Ulrichs is one.

598
01:00:58,926 --> 01:01:03,488
We must be prepared for anything.
I fear we'll never be able to return.

599
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,796
For years the Nazis have blacklists.

600
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:10,033
The Professor, his father-in-law, 
your wife and you are on them.

601
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:15,207
Please, never go back to Berlin.
Hendrik, promise me that.

602
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:17,569
Please!

603
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,624
Cheers, and a thousand thanks!

604
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:46,196
- Cheers!
- I make the toast with water.

605
01:01:46,772 --> 01:01:49,502
To the most beautiful actress in Europe!

606
01:02:17,702 --> 01:02:19,966
When are you going home?

607
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,640
I'll stay a few more days in Budapest.
It´s a beautiful city.

608
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:27,939
Then I'm going to see 
about a contract in Vienna.

609
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:30,477
I understand you, Hendrik.

610
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:36,751
I'll tell you now, 
I'm not going back to Germany, either.

611
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,321
I signed you for this part,

612
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:44,019
so you, too, could slip away,
if you want to.

613
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:49,057
<i>The film studio gave me 
your address in Budapest.</i>

614
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:52,430
<i>I hope my letter reaches you.
I'm in Berlin now.</i>

615
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,936
<i>I've landed a part in a comedy.</i>

616
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:59,064
<i>During the shoot I met the actress 
Lotte Lindenthal.</i>

617
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:04,336
She's friendly with a National Socialist 
officer pilot who's very powerful now.

618
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:10,078
She's wonderful. 
She never flaunts what great influence she has.

619
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:15,922
I told her you were abroad and didn't dare return, 
for certain reasons.

620
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:20,455
"What's the man afraid of?", she said,
"He is an eminent artist."

621
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,224
She said she saw Mephisto several times.

622
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:29,327
"We need such actors", she said, 
and she promised to speak to her friend.

623
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:34,806
This morning she said: 
"No matter what silly things Höfgen has done,

624
01:03:34,908 --> 01:03:38,743
when it's an eminent actor,
they are tolerant."

625
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:44,614
Her friend has promised 
that nothing will happen to you if you return.

626
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:49,017
Hendrik, Berlin awaits you.
You have nothing to fear.

627
01:03:49,123 --> 01:03:55,786
No one can replace you in the the theater.
I know that and also those who rule now our lives.

628
01:03:55,894 --> 01:03:59,695
The theater is a shelter for me 
and people like me,

629
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:03,565
in which we all feel safe
and have nothing to fear.

630
01:04:03,703 --> 01:04:07,833
It would be that for you, too, Hendrik.
Theater is a mission.

631
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:11,535
<i>In true friendship, yours, 
Angelika Siebert.</i>

632
01:05:05,995 --> 01:05:06,962
Name?

633
01:05:07,063 --> 01:05:09,030
- Hendrik Höfgen.
- Profession?

634
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:11,055
Actor.

635
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,155
Where?

636
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:14,593
At the State Theater in Berlin.

637
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,278
- Is something wrong?
- No, no.

638
01:05:28,483 --> 01:05:29,541
Please.

639
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:34,114
Thank you.

640
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:42,657
I don't know if you'll feel 
at home again here, Höfgen.

641
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:49,427
The spirit is different 
from that you were accustomed to.

642
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:53,538
Cultural Bolshevism is over.

643
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:58,120
There will no longer be a chance 
to perform your friend's plays,

644
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,773
or those popular French farces 
you like so much.

645
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:07,596
We perform German art now.

646
01:06:07,954 --> 01:06:14,518
Frankly, I saw no great reason
to recall you from abroad.

647
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:22,859
But Lotte Lindenthal wants you as her partner 
in her comedy debut here.

648
01:06:23,469 --> 01:06:26,461
I didn't want to displease her.

649
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:35,342
The role of elegant friend and seducer
shouldn't cause you any difficulty.

650
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:38,609
I'm so cold.

651
01:06:39,717 --> 01:06:41,582
I'll warm you up.

652
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:45,454
Your room isn't heated
in this dreadful weather?

653
01:06:45,823 --> 01:06:50,227
Is this how you anticipated my visit?
Very nice of you!

654
01:06:50,862 --> 01:06:53,660
There's a warm room over there.
Come.

655
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:56,461
No, I'm in a great hurry today.

656
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,124
It would warm us up.

657
01:06:58,236 --> 01:07:00,830
No, there's no point in this cold flat.

658
01:07:00,937 --> 01:07:03,907
My new maid doesn't know her duties yet.

659
01:07:04,007 --> 01:07:07,272
You should have told her
your visitor needed warmth.

660
01:07:07,378 --> 01:07:09,845
But I've only just returned home.

661
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:13,609
You should have returned earlier!
I knew you`d come.

662
01:07:13,717 --> 01:07:16,948
I'm someone you must wait for, impatiently.

663
01:07:17,053 --> 01:07:21,457
If I want to meet someone in passing,
I have my husband. And besides...

664
01:07:21,557 --> 01:07:26,426
Where did you get this new maid?
She's far too pretty!

665
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,960
It's an honor to act with you.

666
01:07:32,068 --> 01:07:35,868
It's so nice to hear a warm voice again.

667
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:39,497
I'm happy to hear you say that,
I know you're no flatterer.

668
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:44,567
Me, a flatterer? 
I'm notorious for telling people the truth.

669
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,012
I like honest people.

670
01:07:58,425 --> 01:08:04,660
<i>If she turns, everything will be fine.
If she waves, I've scored a triumph.</i>

671
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:11,433
I`ve live 10 years in Hamburg.
After the Reichstag fire, I had to leave the theatre.

672
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:14,200
Bonetti went in uniform to the essay.

673
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:17,409
Before being fire,
he threw me out of the canteen.

674
01:08:17,611 --> 01:08:20,671
He said: 
"We've got you now, Böck. Out!"

675
01:08:20,981 --> 01:08:25,110
They almost beat me up,
my landlady threw me out.

676
01:08:25,219 --> 01:08:27,015
I had to leave Hamburg.

677
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,351
Are you upset that I've come?

678
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:34,083
When I heard you were in Berlin,
I found new hope and I thought:

679
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,711
"Maybe God will help me."
So, I just came.

680
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:41,349
- Are you angry with me?
- I'm not angry with you, Böck.

681
01:08:42,902 --> 01:08:49,238
Live here till things settle down,
but don't tell anyone.

682
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:52,936
Just simply disappear without a word.

683
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:59,583
You know, if I were in your position,
I might well commit suicide.

684
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:04,055
I'll buy you a radio, 
so you'll know what's happening outside.

685
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,505
Don`t leave here 
and don`t speak with neighbors.

686
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,847
I've got nobody else in the world but you.

687
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:15,624
- Is Budapest beautiful?
- I don't know!

688
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:18,326
Yes, quite nice.

689
01:09:18,636 --> 01:09:21,537
I could have gone there.
Barbara wasn't with you.

690
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:24,301
They wouldn't have let you cross the border.

691
01:09:24,442 --> 01:09:30,039
I'm a German citizen, too. My father was pure German. 
Why can't I go out?

692
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:35,209
If you can't understand why,
we'll both be in trouble.

693
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,774
You're horrible!
You look like a caretaker!

694
01:09:39,022 --> 01:09:42,987
- You're an idiot!
- Go to hell you... you actor!

695
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:14,553
Dear Lotte, may I ask a great favor?
I have to play Mephisto. I have.

696
01:10:15,524 --> 01:10:17,184
I'll see what I can do.

697
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:21,588
I look forward to seeing you again as Mephisto.

698
01:10:21,696 --> 01:10:26,632
Between us, it's thanks to me 
you'll be playing Mephisto again.

699
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:32,897
Certain ministerial circles feared
you might revive your old Faust spirit.

700
01:10:33,006 --> 01:10:37,568
The spirit of cultural Bolshevism,
as it was called.

701
01:10:37,712 --> 01:10:42,648
Well, I succeeded in overcoming those fears.

702
01:10:43,149 --> 01:10:46,777
Cesar, thank you, thank you very much.

703
01:10:51,091 --> 01:10:53,058
THANK YOU!

704
01:10:53,192 --> 01:10:55,593
Please give these flowers...

705
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,613
to Miss Lindenthal.

706
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:00,422
Ready.

707
01:11:00,566 --> 01:11:03,000
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

708
01:11:05,004 --> 01:11:06,527
Morning, Mr. Höfgen.

709
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:10,505
Mr. Miklas! 
Are you still around?

710
01:11:10,608 --> 01:11:12,940
- Morning.
- Fine.

711
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:23,445
I've only been here a short space,
I come with a humility to this place...

712
01:11:24,355 --> 01:11:29,952
to find a teacher of vocation
who's held by all in veneration.

713
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,758
How pleasant is your courtesy,
but I`m a common man.

714
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:35,991
Have you looked around?

715
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:39,195
Take me as your student.

716
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:42,329
I come with courage and my young blood.

717
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,432
My mother tried to stop me.
I want to study with all my heart.

718
01:11:46,543 --> 01:11:48,773
You've come to the right place.

719
01:11:48,879 --> 01:11:50,710
I feel like going home I fear.

720
01:11:50,814 --> 01:11:54,306
In that great hall
I won't like it at all.

721
01:11:54,617 --> 01:11:58,519
You see no grass, you see no trees.

722
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:04,582
And in the classes we are taught,
I lose my hearing, sight and thought.

723
01:12:04,827 --> 01:12:06,795
It all depends on habit.

724
01:12:07,355 --> 01:12:11,256
Seeing the breast, 
a child might accept the gift unwillingly.

725
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,156
But soon it sucks in delight.

726
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:17,698
So will you, on wisdom's breast,
enjoy it daily with more zest.

727
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:21,558
Around her neck I'll cling with pleasure,

728
01:12:21,668 --> 01:12:25,798
but tell me how can I find this treasure?

729
01:12:26,006 --> 01:12:30,409
When you continue on your way,
which faculty will make your day?

730
01:12:30,544 --> 01:12:32,568
Is this where the cut comes?

731
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:36,144
The art of medicine is not hard, you know.

732
01:12:36,249 --> 01:12:38,808
You study the world, big and small.

733
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:42,445
And in the end you let them go
when God demands it.

734
01:12:42,555 --> 01:12:45,218
You'll try in vain to learn all science.

735
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:48,384
Each man just learns what he can.

736
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:52,691
But he who grasps every chance,
he is the worthy man.

737
01:12:52,798 --> 01:12:58,168
You are still of pleasing build,
with self-confidence at last instilled,

738
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:01,830
others will have confidence in you.

739
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:05,205
Especially learn the women to enthrall.

740
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:09,007
Eternal moans, a thousand ills.

741
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:12,811
There's just one place to cure them.

742
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:19,151
If you've honor to some degree,
one may allow some shared intimacy.

743
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:26,590
A title helps to make her certain
your art exceeds that of your peers.

744
01:13:26,697 --> 01:13:31,100
And may grant you a glimpse of which
another schemes for many years.

745
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:34,193
Her pulse you must learn to feel.

746
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:38,707
And burning looks you then must steal.

747
01:13:38,808 --> 01:13:46,773
Her slender hips are then embraced,
to see how tightly she is laced.

748
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:51,079
That's what I could care for.

749
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:57,625
Gray, my friend is all theory.
And green the golden tree of life.

750
01:13:59,127 --> 01:14:00,651
That's the way.

751
01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:27,213
I greet the learned gentleman!
You made me to sweat profusely.

752
01:14:27,322 --> 01:14:29,915
- What is your name?
- The question's odd,

753
01:14:30,024 --> 01:14:32,686
for someone who idle talk despises.

754
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:36,786
Who, far removed from worldly show
seeks only academic prizes.

755
01:14:37,597 --> 01:14:41,694
With you, one knows your game
generally by your very name.

756
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:46,397
It's evident, Sire, if one's called a liar.

757
01:14:47,074 --> 01:14:48,062
Who are you?

758
01:14:48,174 --> 01:14:50,404
I'm a part of that force

759
01:14:50,544 --> 01:14:54,240
that always craves evil
and always creates good.

760
01:14:54,347 --> 01:14:55,871
What is this riddle?

761
01:14:55,982 --> 01:14:57,973
I'm the spirit who negates.

762
01:14:58,084 --> 01:15:02,453
And rightly so, for all creation
is worthy of annihilation.

763
01:15:02,554 --> 01:15:05,217
So it were better nothing were created.

764
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:10,388
And so everything you've stated
is sin, destruction, devilment.

765
01:15:10,529 --> 01:15:13,020
Remains my actual element.

766
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:18,134
Good evening, Herr Höfgen.
The Prime Minister invites you to his box.

767
01:15:20,038 --> 01:15:21,027
Yes.

768
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,541
It's all going like clockwork.

769
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:53,692
May I introduce you 
to my distinguished colleague Hendrik Höfgen?

770
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,037
Ah, our Mephistoles.

771
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,152
Congratulations.

772
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:17,623
That mask is perfect, it's evil itself.
It's sacred evil.

773
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:24,296
Yet, your eyes are so kind,
your handshake so soft. It's strange...

774
01:16:25,034 --> 01:16:32,099
it seems the secret of acting is to portray strength, 
yet one is weak.

775
01:16:36,277 --> 01:16:42,113
I imagine you've prepared for this role 
for a long time.

776
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:44,612
All my life, Prime Minister.

777
01:16:45,286 --> 01:16:50,314
That's the only way.
That is the secret of greatness.

778
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,789
Good luck.

779
01:17:27,927 --> 01:17:30,395
Carry on the good work, Mephistoles.

780
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:44,840
Höfgen residence.

781
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:46,636
Lotte Lindenthal!

782
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,800
- Höfgen.
<i>- Hendrik?</i>

783
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,136
<i>- What`ll do after tonight's performance?</i>
- Nothing.

784
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:56,571
<i>Would you like to come afterwards?
There'll be just a few friends here.</i>

785
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:58,073
With pleasure.

786
01:17:59,303 --> 01:18:00,375
Yes, thank you.

787
01:18:00,471 --> 01:18:02,876
<i>- See you then. Bye.</i>
- Thank you.

788
01:18:04,128 --> 01:18:11,034
Böck! Just a few friends will be there,
just a few!

789
01:18:17,073 --> 01:18:19,099
Am I not an incredible villain?

790
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:22,570
Why a villain?
You're just successful, Mr. Höfgen.

791
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,993
To the renewal of German culture,
ladies and gentlemen.

792
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,569
Long live the actors.

793
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,628
Long live! Long live! Long live!

794
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:39,723
Our theater has many elements 
that have nothing to do with Germany.

795
01:18:39,896 --> 01:18:44,492
We must set up a customs control of the mind 
for culture smugglers...

796
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:50,932
to stop foreign elements poisoning
German literature and theater.

797
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,877
This can't be left entirely
to our frontier guards.

798
01:18:56,144 --> 01:19:00,273
Everyone must cooperate in this control.

799
01:19:00,614 --> 01:19:02,776
- Am I understood?
- Yes, General.

800
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:06,482
There are many who don't understand.

801
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:10,522
Look at this painting, my Mephisto.

802
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,984
A masterpiece of German romanticism.

803
01:19:16,363 --> 01:19:21,891
Where did I find it? 
At an art dealer with an foreign accent.

804
01:19:22,002 --> 01:19:25,437
I had it restored. 
No, no...

805
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:30,535
the future of painting 
doesn't belong to the Liebermanns.

806
01:19:30,977 --> 01:19:33,275
Your Mephisto occupies my mind.

807
01:19:33,579 --> 01:19:37,812
You've brought him alive.
He's a hell of a guy.

808
01:19:38,818 --> 01:19:41,753
Isn't there a little of him in all of us?

809
01:19:42,688 --> 01:19:47,489
I mean, isn't there a bit of Mephisto
in every German?

810
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:53,057
Wouldn't our enemies love it 
if we had nothing but the soul of Faust?

811
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:58,727
No, Mephisto is also a German national hero.

812
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:01,431
It's just something we mustn't tell people.

813
01:20:03,307 --> 01:20:05,071
I must go now.

814
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:07,869
Come to my office at 10:30,
the day after tomorrow.

815
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:12,007
I`m expecting some foreign journalists.
French, english, americans.

816
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:16,037
They want to know what 'Germany' means today, 

817
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,580
above all the German culture.

818
01:20:18,923 --> 01:20:24,828
I'll tell them. You can elaborate 
on what I say about theater, for example.

819
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:29,794
About painting, architecture, sculpture,
they`ll have plenty to write about.

820
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,059
I want them to be informed by experts.

821
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,101
Tell me, why do you have
such a limp handshake?

822
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,272
Good day.

823
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:55,442
So, we meet again. How time flies!
You were wonderful as Mephisto.

824
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:59,678
Now you act him more forcefully.
But I liked the other one, too.

825
01:21:59,785 --> 01:22:04,449
I sensed it in the seed of what
can now be unfolded to the full.

826
01:22:04,557 --> 01:22:08,117
I also liked you in the play
with Lotte Lindenthal.

827
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:12,391
Lotte Lindenthal is the ideal actress 
to portray the ideal German woman.

828
01:22:12,497 --> 01:22:16,983
What are we doing here? 
Why is he wasting his time with foreigners?

829
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,234
Do you know what it is?

830
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:26,506
He said they're interested in German culture. 
They'll ask a few questions.

831
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:29,340
- I see. You spoke to him?
- Yes.

832
01:22:29,446 --> 01:22:32,574
How are you?
Nice to meet you again.

833
01:22:32,683 --> 01:22:36,619
The Prime Minister sent for me.
I hope this doesn't last too long.

834
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:41,487
Always problems with the old statues.
Shall we tear them down or not?

835
01:22:41,592 --> 01:22:44,993
As if that were important for our future.

836
01:22:45,362 --> 01:22:47,830
I'd like to sculpt a bust of you, Höfgen.

837
01:22:47,998 --> 01:22:53,128
What sort of man are you? 
Your own face differs amazingly from Mephisto.

838
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:56,228
In private you don`t look devilish, 
but rather shy.

839
01:22:56,339 --> 01:23:00,469
I'll do a bust of you,
but in clay or in bronze?

840
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:03,874
- What is your face made of?
- Perhaps a mixture.

841
01:23:04,447 --> 01:23:09,749
I very much enjoyed your Mephisto.
I only had eyes for you.

842
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:11,017
I'm preparing an exhibition.

843
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:14,977
The General wants a preview.
Try to come. 

844
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,392
- Here's my number.
- Thank you.

845
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:22,296
If you have time, 
give me a ring and come to my studio.

846
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:26,025
You can relax while I model you.
How strange your face is.

847
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,966
A German face yet it changes every moment.

848
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:32,562
That's acting.
The rest is humility and hard work.

849
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:39,677
I've discovered your secret, Mephisto.
It's the surprise effect, right?

850
01:23:41,048 --> 01:23:42,879
The unexpected.

851
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:48,922
I've been watching the way you appear on stage. 
Always different.

852
01:23:51,357 --> 01:23:53,484
Sometimes quick, erratic.

853
01:23:53,594 --> 01:23:57,290
Then slow, suddenly,
when the audience is lulled.

854
01:23:57,964 --> 01:24:00,865
But always surprising and unpredictable.

855
01:24:02,102 --> 01:24:06,004
Thus you create the feeling of something original,

856
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:11,212
even if the spectator knows your lines by heart.
That is you secret.

857
01:24:11,277 --> 01:24:16,373
And your glib tongue, 
your deliberate pauses, your precise emphasis.

858
01:24:18,517 --> 01:24:20,451
I think I'm learning from you.

859
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,019
It's important to be unpredictable.

860
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:30,756
The spectators needn't know 
what my next step is or where I'm going.

861
01:24:30,896 --> 01:24:34,592
- They're not prepared and can`t defend themselves.
- Exactly.

862
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,828
Yet it was only a change of pace,
or a slightly longer pause.

863
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:43,737
In the theater it's the others 
who make the king a king.

864
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:50,542
Building the role is all important;
pianissimo alternating with fortissimo.

865
01:24:50,648 --> 01:24:55,175
Naturally, you need a certain flair, 
artistic talent,

866
01:24:55,286 --> 01:24:58,652
and as I usually say,
a high degree of culture.

867
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:01,781
When I hear the word culture,
I reach for my revolver.

868
01:25:01,892 --> 01:25:08,161
Bourgeois nonsense! 
Bolsheviks preach it to win over school teachers.

869
01:25:08,265 --> 01:25:10,699
To say nothing of artists.
Isn't that so?

870
01:25:11,902 --> 01:25:15,770
I wasn't untouched by Bolshevik trends, either.

871
01:25:16,105 --> 01:25:20,132
And I must admit that for a while
I flirted with the left.

872
01:25:21,744 --> 01:25:25,976
Well, anyone can get involved in some folly.

873
01:25:27,016 --> 01:25:30,473
Those were troubled times.
Let's have a drink.

874
01:25:39,094 --> 01:25:44,656
General, other deserving artists
committed the follies I did.

875
01:25:44,767 --> 01:25:50,204
I can't forget those paying for sins 
for which I've been generously pardoned.

876
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,899
I'm pleading for a certain person,
for a friend.

877
01:25:56,544 --> 01:26:01,140
I guarantee he's reformed.
General, I'm pleading for Otto Ulrichs.

878
01:26:03,016 --> 01:26:06,179
Otto Ulrichs? Who's he?

879
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,414
He ran the communist cabaret,
'The Storm-Bird'.

880
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:16,723
Well... he must be a pretty bad fellow.

881
01:26:16,829 --> 01:26:19,196
No, he's not bad.

882
01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:23,793
A bit rash, I admit.
A bit thoughtless, but not bad.

883
01:26:24,036 --> 01:26:28,996
If anything, he's too decent.
Once he gives his word, he keeps it.

884
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:49,787
I'm back at the State Theater!

885
01:26:50,896 --> 01:26:54,559
The funny thing is,
I simply can't believe it.

886
01:26:55,967 --> 01:27:01,405
Just as I can't believe
I'm here with you by the window.

887
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,075
I know it's reality, but I don't feel it.

888
01:27:29,032 --> 01:27:32,024
- Great art.
- Magnificent, really.

889
01:27:32,135 --> 01:27:33,898
A German work of art.

890
01:27:34,003 --> 01:27:37,530
Not every German artist is capable of such work.

891
01:27:38,407 --> 01:27:40,875
It is a courageous work.

892
01:27:48,318 --> 01:27:49,944
Come, Mephisto.

893
01:27:52,254 --> 01:27:53,812
You sign, too.

894
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,679
What did I prophesy?
The exhibition is a success.

895
01:28:04,717 --> 01:28:05,976
Thank you very much.

896
01:28:24,085 --> 01:28:27,076
You rascal, so you make secret visits here.

897
01:28:29,824 --> 01:28:34,920
If I may add something personal,
it is a courageous work.

898
01:28:35,029 --> 01:28:38,293
Courageous, because it captures our time,

899
01:28:38,431 --> 01:28:43,664
the beauty of strength without bourgeois snobbery.

900
01:28:43,803 --> 01:28:46,499
Contrasting the degenerate taste

901
01:28:46,872 --> 01:28:49,340
of the loud-mouths of culture.

902
01:28:49,442 --> 01:28:56,347
We see muscles and clear-cut features 
mankind wants to see.

903
01:28:56,482 --> 01:28:59,383
Strong and beautiful in his strength.

904
01:28:59,885 --> 01:29:03,446
Warrior-like and victorious in his struggle.

905
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:13,014
Good day Hendrik Höfgen. 

906
01:29:13,117 --> 01:29:16,017
- That was a wonderful speech.
- Nicoletta! You`re here?

907
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,360
- You know each other?
- Very well!

908
01:29:19,904 --> 01:29:21,872
You're in Berlin? Since when?

909
01:29:21,973 --> 01:29:25,009
I'm only here because I want to dine with you.

910
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,696
I haven't seen you for so long,
but I read all about you.

911
01:29:28,879 --> 01:29:30,780
So where will we go?

912
01:29:31,816 --> 01:29:35,718
Your choice. How's Hamburg?
Surviving without me?

913
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:40,150
I'm in Berlin to have dinner with you.
Hamburg is history.

914
01:29:40,257 --> 01:29:44,784
You're out of touch. 
Kroge's in Switzerland. He just vanished.

915
01:29:44,895 --> 01:29:48,661
Didn't even tell his girl. Simply went.

916
01:29:49,865 --> 01:29:51,594
Kroge is a traitor.

917
01:29:58,474 --> 01:30:00,669
Why must you appear with them?

918
01:30:00,776 --> 01:30:02,573
Because they asked me to.

919
01:30:02,678 --> 01:30:05,578
They ask others, too. You needn't go.

920
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:12,381
You can't refuse, none of us can.
If anyone says they do, they're lying!

921
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:16,989
Besides, the General's a nice chap
and he knows a lot about the theater.

922
01:30:17,093 --> 01:30:19,890
He's not so closed minded as most others.

923
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:25,694
A well behaved boy who wants to enjoy 
the rewards for good behavior.

924
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,997
- Yes, I like to be well behaved.
- Because you're afraid.

925
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:34,767
- I like it.
- Then you should.

926
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:39,404
It will be difficult to stay with me
and maintain good behavior.

927
01:30:44,017 --> 01:30:46,611
Damned black woman, right?

928
01:30:46,987 --> 01:30:50,514
I can't help being different
from what's allowed here.

929
01:30:50,624 --> 01:30:54,889
And is visible.
People can spit in my face in the street.

930
01:30:54,995 --> 01:30:57,896
Even if I wanted, 
I can't do anything about it.

931
01:30:57,997 --> 01:31:02,457
My nose, my hair remain the same
even if I`m ashame.

932
01:31:02,568 --> 01:31:07,198
Yet, I'm German, a German Negro.
German is my mother tongue.

933
01:31:07,306 --> 01:31:10,571
What am I supposed to do?
Where should I go?

934
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:14,372
I don't know. 
I don't even know what will become of me.

935
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,373
You think only of yourself!

936
01:31:17,549 --> 01:31:21,178
And like an idiot,
I dreamt of us having a child!

937
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:22,685
- That's all we need.
- Why?

938
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:29,383
Is the child to be to blame, 
for she might ruin her father's career?

939
01:31:29,493 --> 01:31:31,325
That's enough now!

940
01:31:32,063 --> 01:31:35,524
- Now it`s enough!
- Now it`s enough?

941
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,641
Enough...

942
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:42,389
I can see why your wife
couldn't stand living with you.

943
01:31:44,742 --> 01:31:48,838
Here... I pinched a photo of you once. 
Look at it!

944
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,175
Do you recognize yourself?

945
01:31:51,315 --> 01:31:53,215
Hello, I must speak to you.

946
01:31:53,684 --> 01:31:56,481
To tell me what you've said behind my back?

947
01:31:56,586 --> 01:31:58,282
I don't know what you mean.

948
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:02,051
Hendrik Höfgen has no scruples.
Didn't you say that?

949
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:05,025
I won't dispute that I dislike you.

950
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:08,690
- What do you want?
- I want you to sign this.

951
01:32:08,798 --> 01:32:11,129
My signature? What for?

952
01:32:11,334 --> 01:32:15,030
You want a raise?
Or do you collect signatures

953
01:32:15,138 --> 01:32:19,198
because theater safety regulations 
are a bit unsafe?

954
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:26,403
From a moral standpoint much seems unsafe. 
And I don't mean the theater.

955
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,184
What do you protest against?

956
01:32:30,285 --> 01:32:33,777
Against a leadership that disregards our rights.

957
01:32:35,157 --> 01:32:38,888
But you are in the Nazi party,
since back when you were in Hamburg.

958
01:32:38,993 --> 01:32:40,585
I'm leaving the party.

959
01:32:42,496 --> 01:32:44,054
That's your business.

960
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:48,835
I'd like to ask you to read our protest 
and sign it.

961
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:55,875
Regardless of my opinion, 
you are today's leading German actor.

962
01:32:57,345 --> 01:33:00,405
Let me say that I won't even read this thing.

963
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:05,980
Be careful not to get yourself and others 
into real trouble.

964
01:33:06,354 --> 01:33:08,446
Miklas, you can go to hell.

965
01:33:14,027 --> 01:33:16,928
I won't let a dirty pig like you provoke me.

966
01:33:34,747 --> 01:33:35,771
Dear God!

967
01:33:38,816 --> 01:33:41,410
Congratulations, my dear Höfgen!

968
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:46,582
You put it precisely.
There are some you only can send them to hell.

969
01:33:46,692 --> 01:33:50,149
If you were a soldier, I'd promote you. 
I'm very pleased.

970
01:33:51,596 --> 01:33:55,191
By the way, you needn't be afraid.

971
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:02,000
For the fun of it, I checked your horoscope. 
It's excellent.

972
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:05,674
<i>- Best of luck, Höfgen.</i>
- Thank you.

973
01:34:12,349 --> 01:34:13,680
Did something happen?

974
01:34:13,447 --> 01:34:14,782
Good morning.

975
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:15,840
Good morning.

976
01:34:19,089 --> 01:34:20,453
Good morning.

977
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:45,268
Quick!
Start walking!

978
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:29,421
We regret to inform the colleagues that the actor 
Hans Miklas has died in a car accident.

979
01:35:33,093 --> 01:35:34,958
How awful, such a young fellow.

980
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:41,491
But, frankly, 
there was something disquieting about him,

981
01:35:41,567 --> 01:35:43,193
don't you think, Hendrik?

982
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:47,936
Disquieting...

983
01:36:01,553 --> 01:36:04,147
That was no car accident.

984
01:36:08,359 --> 01:36:11,557
He must have come to you, too,
with that protest.

985
01:36:11,662 --> 01:36:16,258
Are you insane?
How can you talk such nonsense?

986
01:36:16,935 --> 01:36:20,267
Why shouldn't it have been a car accident?

987
01:36:20,671 --> 01:36:24,436
Do you think the government 
would stage a car accident,

988
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:27,136
all for some unknown actor?

989
01:36:28,446 --> 01:36:31,107
We're not in some tenth-rate melodrama.

990
01:36:31,948 --> 01:36:35,476
People shouldn't cross roads in heavy traffic.

991
01:36:43,259 --> 01:36:48,492
I've great plans for you.
You can refuse and remain an actor.

992
01:36:49,264 --> 01:36:53,224
But then you can't do 
as much for our cause as you could.

993
01:36:55,104 --> 01:36:58,903
Your speech was good.
I realized you're not only an actor.

994
01:37:00,209 --> 01:37:06,205
You put the essence into words.
Write your own biography, Hendrik.

995
01:37:07,082 --> 01:37:11,985
Submit it to me, as soon as possible.
Höfgen...

996
01:37:12,821 --> 01:37:17,257
you will manage the Prussian State Theater. 
Your task is easy:

997
01:37:17,358 --> 01:37:23,160
A full house and a wildly enthusiastic
audience for you.

998
01:37:23,831 --> 01:37:24,923
Do you understand?

999
01:37:26,767 --> 01:37:32,228
No need to enlarge upon your past in Hamburg.

1000
01:37:33,373 --> 01:37:38,073
Nor need we mention the Revolutionary Theater.

1001
01:37:38,178 --> 01:37:40,977
Just mention some of your roles there.

1002
01:37:47,254 --> 01:37:51,190
What did you really imagine in Hamburg?

1003
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,324
How could you have conceived...

1004
01:37:56,563 --> 01:38:02,933
promoting Russian Bolshevism?
You, a German. Incredible!

1005
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:07,002
- Where is your wife now?
- In Paris, I believe.

1006
01:38:07,106 --> 01:38:11,634
No, she's in Amsterdam,
working against her Motherland.

1007
01:38:11,743 --> 01:38:14,007
They're publishing a newspaper.

1008
01:38:17,348 --> 01:38:19,749
You don't correspond with her?

1009
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:23,414
We have no contact at all.

1010
01:38:23,788 --> 01:38:27,349
You'll get a divorce easily.
I'll see to that.

1011
01:38:28,893 --> 01:38:31,691
German citizens who have left Germany

1012
01:38:31,863 --> 01:38:36,265
couldn't wipe us out, 
so they signed their own death sentence.

1013
01:38:36,501 --> 01:38:39,867
Where weakness perishes,
humanity becomes healthy.

1014
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:43,131
Politics, like theater, is a fight.

1015
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,571
Just as every rebuild is the start of a new war.

1016
01:38:50,047 --> 01:38:52,481
But we're not talking about this now.

1017
01:38:54,116 --> 01:39:00,180
Hamburg...
<i>In a harbor town by the river...</i>

1018
01:39:01,992 --> 01:39:06,860
Lots of foreigners, night clubs, bars.
I understand you perfectly.

1019
01:39:08,764 --> 01:39:13,633
But in the Reich's capital?
No offense, we're men, but...

1020
01:39:13,803 --> 01:39:19,468
What's this Hamburg souvenir doing here? 
Juliette Martens.

1021
01:39:21,109 --> 01:39:23,135
Is she kept by you?

1022
01:39:27,949 --> 01:39:31,543
You once, rightfully, said...

1023
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,515
"Professor Bruckner 
was not a man of the future."

1024
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:39,888
And, even more rightly,
you parted from his daughter.

1025
01:39:40,795 --> 01:39:44,992
If you have such a good instinct for a healthy, 
clean attitude...

1026
01:39:45,633 --> 01:39:48,500
what's this Negro-woman doing in Berlin?

1027
01:39:51,405 --> 01:39:52,804
Mephisto...

1028
01:39:55,009 --> 01:40:00,275
it defies racial purity.
Don't even keep her picture at home.

1029
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:01,569
General...

1030
01:40:01,682 --> 01:40:03,547
Wait, I haven't finished.

1031
01:40:05,019 --> 01:40:08,681
I hope you completely understood me.

1032
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:13,425
- Yes.
- So?

1033
01:40:14,861 --> 01:40:18,194
- She's not to come to any harm.
- Leave that to me.

1034
01:40:19,731 --> 01:40:22,963
I'd like to request, Prime Minister,

1035
01:40:23,068 --> 01:40:26,732
that she'd be allowed to leave Germany unharmed.

1036
01:40:26,838 --> 01:40:30,067
Agreed. 
She'll be taken to the frontier and good-bye. 

1037
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:34,028
Forget this part of our conversation.

1038
01:40:34,346 --> 01:40:39,682
You'll hold a press conference,
giving information about the theater.

1039
01:40:39,851 --> 01:40:42,819
The repertoire, plans and your performances.

1040
01:40:43,155 --> 01:40:48,717
In October there'll be a big cultural event 
in our Paris embassy.

1041
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:51,158
I'd like you to attend it.

1042
01:40:58,668 --> 01:41:02,298
Böck! 
I bet they know about him, too.

1043
01:41:02,673 --> 01:41:07,075
Böck! Böck! My note-book.

1044
01:41:09,412 --> 01:41:10,880
Böck stays.

1045
01:41:13,616 --> 01:41:16,449
- Here it is.
- Give it to me.

1046
01:41:18,722 --> 01:41:22,885
I have to call friends.
I urgently need a friend.

1047
01:41:23,459 --> 01:41:28,021
- Find me a friend.
- But you've so many friends.

1048
01:41:30,099 --> 01:41:31,293
Friends...

1049
01:41:43,612 --> 01:41:47,980
Call Miss Nicoletta von Niebuhr.
Find the number and call her.

1050
01:41:57,191 --> 01:41:59,159
Shall I make coffee, or tea?

1051
01:41:59,293 --> 01:42:02,262
Shall I become manager? 
Yes or no?

1052
01:42:03,364 --> 01:42:06,992
Can I? May I? Must I?

1053
01:42:07,702 --> 01:42:11,159
Is it my duty?
Can I make myself useful?

1054
01:42:11,272 --> 01:42:15,105
I mean, can I help anyone?
And if so, should I?

1055
01:42:16,243 --> 01:42:19,906
Or shall I look at it as a new role?

1056
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,173
Or shall I emigrate to America?

1057
01:42:22,281 --> 01:42:25,547
I can earn as much in films as Dora Martin.

1058
01:42:26,185 --> 01:42:30,144
If I accept such an office of this government, 
then...

1059
01:42:33,726 --> 01:42:35,626
Do I want to, at all?

1060
01:42:37,429 --> 01:42:39,226
They need me.

1061
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:42,860
I was about to emigrate,

1062
01:42:42,968 --> 01:42:47,495
and now the Prussian Minister
asks me to rescue his theater.

1063
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:50,574
Tomorrow morning I must give him an answer.

1064
01:42:51,843 --> 01:42:56,543
Heaven evidently has great plans for me.

1065
01:42:56,715 --> 01:42:58,113
Then you've won.

1066
01:43:00,618 --> 01:43:02,347
Would you help me?

1067
01:43:03,988 --> 01:43:06,286
I'd be proud of you.

1068
01:43:09,426 --> 01:43:11,952
Yes, I'll help you, Hendrik.

1069
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:28,702
If only one could live for ever.

1070
01:43:38,688 --> 01:43:43,182
Here's your passport for France.
You have five minutes to pack.

1071
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:44,758
Yes, but why?

1072
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:47,125
We're waiting. Hurry up.

1073
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:01,074
You needn't thank me for this raise.

1074
01:44:01,176 --> 01:44:04,703
I made it a condition for taking over this job.

1075
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,677
Everything's covered with dust!

1076
01:44:07,249 --> 01:44:13,185
If you don't clean the dressing rooms
as well as all the others,

1077
01:44:13,588 --> 01:44:17,088
you may have to look for another job,
outside the Prussian State Theater.

1078
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:22,828
I hope we'll get along. 
If you have any problems, come to me.

1079
01:44:23,123 --> 01:44:25,959
I would like to treat you all to coffee.

1080
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:32,299
Allow me to give you the money.
I'm sorry I can't come with you.

1081
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:34,830
Mr. Joachim would like to speak to you.

1082
01:44:35,104 --> 01:44:37,104
Send him in.

1083
01:44:37,204 --> 01:44:39,104
Wait, Hannelore!

1084
01:44:45,018 --> 01:44:47,048
So, now he can enter.

1085
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:50,684
Please, consider decent roles for me.

1086
01:44:51,044 --> 01:44:54,221
With you I can talk.
You're not like the other managers.

1087
01:44:54,861 --> 01:44:57,921
You're an actor yourself.
You understand.

1088
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:02,057
<i>I must act as if he's saying something important.</i>

1089
01:45:03,802 --> 01:45:08,102
When you talk to actors, you must put them at ease. 
That goes for me, too.

1090
01:45:08,273 --> 01:45:14,973
No, I don't like Premieres. 
All night one has to wear a big, frozen smile.

1091
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,445
I hate that!

1092
01:45:19,517 --> 01:45:23,954
You think it's a good costume?
I don't! I think it's terrible!

1093
01:45:24,822 --> 01:45:27,485
Good morning, Mr. Kappelmüller.
How are you?

1094
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:29,684
- Good.
- How's the family?

1095
01:45:29,794 --> 01:45:32,593
So your daughter graduated as a hairdresser. 
Maybe we can use her.

1096
01:45:32,792 --> 01:45:33,794
See you later. Continue.

1097
01:45:34,498 --> 01:45:35,829
Good morning!

1098
01:45:37,835 --> 01:45:43,739
Haven't you noticed? 
New suit, new shoes, new manager, no? Well.

1099
01:45:44,107 --> 01:45:49,374
"Ex-Bolshevik Höfgen, 
manager of the Prussian State Theater,

1100
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:54,177
is letting his former comrade
appear in his production of Hamlet."

1101
01:46:00,056 --> 01:46:04,390
Hannelore?
Has the cast list for Hamlet already been posted?

1102
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:05,551
Not yet.

1103
01:46:06,296 --> 01:46:10,527
Good. Let's wait another two days.
Thank you.

1104
01:46:16,372 --> 01:46:19,466
I must offer them more than old comrades.

1105
01:46:19,741 --> 01:46:24,906
You must cultivate connections.
That's the essence of the system.

1106
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:29,506
Let me tell you, 
yesterday I went to the Prussian State Theater,

1107
01:46:29,617 --> 01:46:34,611
it was Faust and the name 
of some white-faced clown was Mephisto.

1108
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:39,624
What a joke! 
And Mephisto by some man called Höfgen, it was terrible!

1109
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:44,186
I'd rather go to the Bavarian People's Theater. 
Goodbye then.

1110
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:47,694
Why am I doing all this?

1111
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:50,492
Because I enjoy it.

1112
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:56,041
I must enjoy amateur plays 
and use actors that are blonde, not talented.

1113
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:58,441
Most are totally untalented.

1114
01:46:58,612 --> 01:47:03,071
A Frankfurt audience applauded Marquis Posa's

1115
01:47:03,183 --> 01:47:07,346
'Give us freedom of thought'.
Performance stopped, play withdrawn.

1116
01:47:07,453 --> 01:47:12,186
In Munich, 'The Robbers', withdrawn.
Schiller, our national poet!

1117
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:17,160
They want to produce plays by German authors. 
But what authors?

1118
01:47:17,296 --> 01:47:23,256
Those who haven't emigrated
aren't allowed to write, or won't.

1119
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:29,307
It's simply impossible 
to offer theater worthy of the name.

1120
01:47:29,475 --> 01:47:36,744
Unless I dig up a couple of old farces.
All Rococco wigs and white faces.

1121
01:47:39,818 --> 01:47:46,451
The joke is that the regime 
now sees Shakespeare as one of our own.

1122
01:47:46,557 --> 01:47:50,857
Let's do 'As You Like It',
'Where the Banished Return.'

1123
01:47:51,161 --> 01:47:55,154
Show the opponents of dictatorship
that the will for freedom still lives.

1124
01:47:55,265 --> 01:47:59,030
I didn't hear that!
I can't possibly have heard that!

1125
01:48:06,076 --> 01:48:08,374
Am I not an incredible villain?

1126
01:48:10,179 --> 01:48:12,875
Isn't what I'm doing insane?

1127
01:48:18,754 --> 01:48:22,281
"Fürst and Niklisch, 
both on the staff of your theater,

1128
01:48:22,592 --> 01:48:27,585
on grounds of German racial purity... 
dismiss them."

1129
01:48:27,868 --> 01:48:31,360
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1130
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:36,272
- Well, how are you?
- Fine.

1131
01:48:37,444 --> 01:48:39,279
- And you?
- Everything all right.

1132
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:41,414
- I don`t want to interrupt.
- See you later.

1133
01:48:42,611 --> 01:48:46,377
The stage-hands that are concerned,
Fürst and Niklisch...

1134
01:48:47,248 --> 01:48:49,581
are indispensable...

1135
01:48:52,354 --> 01:48:55,948
and the loss of their services...

1136
01:48:56,558 --> 01:49:01,688
would jeopardize the theater's work. 
Date. Heil! Signature.

1137
01:49:06,867 --> 01:49:09,960
Germans!
Don't tolerate Nazi oppression!

1138
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,735
Embassy of the German Reich

1139
01:50:49,865 --> 01:50:53,858
Did you bring me anything from Germany? 
A leather coat, at least?

1140
01:50:54,369 --> 01:50:55,802
- A leather coat?
- Yes.

1141
01:50:55,904 --> 01:51:02,035
Those who took me to the frontier had them.
It's the fashion for men. 

1142
01:51:07,415 --> 01:51:11,545
Your eyes are so dead,
how do they look?

1143
01:51:12,153 --> 01:51:14,950
- Empty?
- No, dazed.

1144
01:51:15,056 --> 01:51:17,546
Yes, that's how I felt these past days.

1145
01:51:17,659 --> 01:51:20,354
You see? You were never like that.

1146
01:51:21,895 --> 01:51:26,026
I've thought a lot about you.
I believe I should be grateful.

1147
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:30,693
Without you, I'd be in a concentration camp, 
or already dead.

1148
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:36,870
If you still like being with me,
then stay here.

1149
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:40,772
I'll look after you. 
You needn't leave the house, not at first.

1150
01:51:40,881 --> 01:51:43,873
Then I`ll find you a job. 
You're so gifted.

1151
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:47,744
- I could have gone to America.
- There you go.

1152
01:51:48,354 --> 01:51:51,448
Yes, I think I am gifted.

1153
01:51:51,691 --> 01:51:53,682
But also a terrible coward.

1154
01:51:54,326 --> 01:51:58,855
What do I do elsewhere? 
Be an extra, a stage-hand, a technician?

1155
01:52:00,231 --> 01:52:04,100
Do you think these hands
were made for manual labor?

1156
01:52:04,469 --> 01:52:07,461
I'll provide for you.
What else do you want?

1157
01:52:08,506 --> 01:52:09,700
Success.

1158
01:52:09,808 --> 01:52:14,142
Hendrik Höfgen, just imagine...
you'd belong to me.

1159
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:19,979
Juliette, I have to go now.

1160
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:25,247
- Shall I see you again?
- I don't know.

1161
01:52:25,356 --> 01:52:30,622
- Can I see you off at the station?
- No, you don't fit into the picture.

1162
01:52:33,597 --> 01:52:37,259
All right, forget the station.
Just do what you want.

1163
01:52:37,935 --> 01:52:39,402
I do.

1164
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:42,861
That's why I'm here.

1165
01:52:45,742 --> 01:52:49,838
Juliette, don't write anymore.
It's no good.

1166
01:53:33,988 --> 01:53:36,422
There aren't many people in this café.

1167
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:42,319
Would you prefer to sit in the sun?
You like that.

1168
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:46,058
No. Though I haven't had much sunshine lately.

1169
01:53:49,369 --> 01:53:52,861
May I ask you something?
Do you still live alone?

1170
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,034
No, I've got friends. And you?

1171
01:53:56,776 --> 01:54:00,803
Friends? In times like these?
It's difficult.

1172
01:54:02,115 --> 01:54:06,414
How can you still live in Berlin?
You know what`s going on.

1173
01:54:06,518 --> 01:54:08,919
- What keeps you there?
- Barbara, I live in the theater.

1174
01:54:09,088 --> 01:54:10,953
And that is in Berlin?

1175
01:54:11,089 --> 01:54:14,923
I don't think you can judge from Paris.

1176
01:54:18,864 --> 01:54:23,426
You're more than an actor now.
You took an oath. You're a manager.

1177
01:54:23,669 --> 01:54:26,638
I didn't take the oath,
I just moved my lips.

1178
01:54:26,737 --> 01:54:30,139
Someone has to save our values 
for a better world.

1179
01:54:30,275 --> 01:54:36,270
I'm playing Hamlet, 
whether those in power like Shakespeare or not.

1180
01:54:36,614 --> 01:54:43,076
Shakespeare is their ornament to prove 
"we're not as bad as you think."

1181
01:54:43,187 --> 01:54:44,916
You can't stay in Berlin.

1182
01:54:45,055 --> 01:54:49,617
I have a family in Berlin.
You know I'm married to the theater.

1183
01:54:49,993 --> 01:54:52,860
I can help people who are having a hard time.

1184
01:54:52,963 --> 01:54:56,330
If I leave, nothing better will replace me.

1185
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:57,958
Words!

1186
01:54:58,969 --> 01:55:01,233
It's always the same with you.

1187
01:55:01,338 --> 01:55:04,636
Your method of self-deception is still intact.

1188
01:55:05,442 --> 01:55:11,381
Don't you see? Whoever you save,
it's only a gesture to your friends.

1189
01:55:11,504 --> 01:55:13,973
You're a show-case. 
By legalizing those people, you participate.

1190
01:55:13,973 --> 01:55:15,875
You`ll never get rid of the guilt.

1191
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:20,246
We can't choose when and where we're born.

1192
01:55:20,456 --> 01:55:22,446
An entire people can't emigrate.

1193
01:55:22,558 --> 01:55:27,791
As an actor I'm obliged to live in my country, 
to observe and portray it.

1194
01:55:27,897 --> 01:55:32,095
And I can tell you, 
there are decent people among them.

1195
01:55:32,467 --> 01:55:39,532
I hate coffee shop intellectuals 
and I hate such resistance-fighters, too.

1196
01:55:39,641 --> 01:55:45,546
The really valuable, 
such as theater and art can rise above everything.

1197
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,607
That's my conviction.

1198
01:55:47,782 --> 01:55:50,215
Why did you want to meet me?

1199
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:54,311
Well, I don't really know why.

1200
01:55:58,058 --> 01:56:00,583
It might even be dangerous for you.

1201
01:56:04,163 --> 01:56:07,691
Tell me, Barbara, did you ever...

1202
01:56:09,269 --> 01:56:10,861
really love me?

1203
01:56:13,839 --> 01:56:20,176
Why did I come here today? 
If you'd been listening, you wouldn't ask that.

1204
01:56:21,881 --> 01:56:25,408
If you don't accept what's happening in Germany,

1205
01:56:25,517 --> 01:56:27,452
why do you still live there?

1206
01:56:27,587 --> 01:56:30,021
What does freedom mean for you?

1207
01:56:30,288 --> 01:56:34,783
Do you need it to live? 
Or do you just need to be successful and loved?

1208
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:38,393
I'm satisfied with success.
It means many love me.

1209
01:56:38,496 --> 01:56:41,294
And the fury of the envious does me good.

1210
01:56:41,733 --> 01:56:46,329
Babara, don't make me responsible
for the impotence of your friends.

1211
01:56:46,471 --> 01:56:49,497
- Mr. Höfgen.
- Mr. Davidson, this is a surprise!

1212
01:57:04,955 --> 01:57:07,583
The check...
L'addition, s'il vous plait.

1213
01:57:08,726 --> 01:57:10,283
Have I come too early?

1214
01:57:11,494 --> 01:57:12,860
Farewell, Barbara.

1215
01:57:15,633 --> 01:57:16,997
May I pay?

1216
01:57:35,484 --> 01:57:37,214
What could I do here?

1217
01:57:49,697 --> 01:57:51,063
Freedom...

1218
01:57:52,668 --> 01:57:53,861
What for?

1219
01:59:15,079 --> 01:59:16,671
Oberon and Titania!

1220
01:59:22,285 --> 01:59:23,752
Congratulations!

1221
01:59:25,256 --> 01:59:31,854
I greet our wonderful and truly tantalizing 
German bride and groom.

1222
01:59:31,962 --> 01:59:35,557
Two young, yet mature people,

1223
01:59:35,664 --> 01:59:40,124
of purest race and noblest blood,
who have enchanted us

1224
01:59:40,237 --> 01:59:45,140
and who serve our new society!

1225
01:59:51,814 --> 01:59:54,180
- Thank you very much.
- All the best.

1226
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:55,578
Thank you.

1227
01:59:57,089 --> 01:59:59,559
Marietta, what joy!

1228
02:00:00,052 --> 02:00:02,092
Thank you all!

1229
02:00:02,181 --> 02:00:04,955
General, nice of you to come.

1230
02:00:05,393 --> 02:00:09,727
They can say what they want.
For me, the world is Grünewald!

1231
02:00:09,936 --> 02:00:12,302
Thank you for coming.

1232
02:00:14,001 --> 02:00:19,337
I'll remain a German artist and patriot,
no matter who may rule my land.

1233
02:00:19,473 --> 02:00:23,068
Grünewald is my favorite place,

1234
02:00:23,178 --> 02:00:26,408
and what other country brews such good beer?

1235
02:00:26,684 --> 02:00:27,753
Cesar!

1236
02:00:28,083 --> 02:00:30,473
- Thank you for coming.
- Sic itur ad astra

1237
02:00:31,885 --> 02:00:36,845
You can hold your rehearsals in this villa, Hendrik.

1238
02:00:38,425 --> 02:00:42,986
We're very proud of the way
you spoke in Paris.

1239
02:00:43,096 --> 02:00:48,398
The way you simply answered
all the questions...

1240
02:00:49,002 --> 02:00:53,734
and said quite frankly and honestly 
what it's like here.

1241
02:02:04,841 --> 02:02:06,774
Carry on dancing.

1242
02:02:08,411 --> 02:02:09,434
Good evening.

1243
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:15,441
Now, that's a surprise!
I won't say no to that.

1244
02:02:26,728 --> 02:02:29,787
- Congratulations, my Mephisto!
- Thank you.

1245
02:02:29,898 --> 02:02:35,494
Now, as old Admiral Tirpitz said:
"Target sighted! Full speed ahead!"

1246
02:02:35,603 --> 02:02:38,500
I'm looking forward to your Hamlet, my Mephisto.

1247
02:02:38,684 --> 02:02:40,219
Me too.

1248
02:02:40,273 --> 02:02:45,134
Your interview in Paris 
made a good impression on all of us.

1249
02:02:46,077 --> 02:02:47,066
My dear.

1250
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:51,849
Congratulations!
And lots of healthy German boys!

1251
02:02:52,218 --> 02:02:53,208
Thank you.

1252
02:02:56,756 --> 02:02:57,780
Madam?

1253
02:03:02,362 --> 02:03:03,454
Beautiful.

1254
02:03:10,103 --> 02:03:13,936
Yes, very much to my taste.

1255
02:03:27,919 --> 02:03:29,319
Very lovely.

1256
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:33,357
Thank you, Madam.

1257
02:03:36,662 --> 02:03:37,685
Cheers!

1258
02:03:41,099 --> 02:03:43,590
We have no working hours, just work.

1259
02:03:44,569 --> 02:03:46,560
I'm sorry, I must go now.

1260
02:03:51,676 --> 02:03:55,270
Be happy together... Hamlet.

1261
02:06:01,899 --> 02:06:07,633
Nicoletta, lately I've been wondering 
whether we actually deserve all this.

1262
02:06:08,372 --> 02:06:12,103
If I'm forced to answer,
then I must say "Yes."

1263
02:06:12,209 --> 02:06:16,646
If not we, 
who represent individuality and art...

1264
02:06:17,214 --> 02:06:22,207
who else should, can and must rise
above all that happens in the world?

1265
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:26,652
That's why we're an example
and encouragement to others.

1266
02:06:26,823 --> 02:06:29,519
No matter how filthy the world is,

1267
02:06:29,626 --> 02:06:34,996
true art always remains pure and true, 
doesn't it?

1268
02:06:35,098 --> 02:06:37,327
I'm married to the theater.

1269
02:06:38,401 --> 02:06:39,561
And so are you.

1270
02:06:40,426 --> 02:06:45,696
I try to call Otto Ulrichs about the raise 
and to sign the contract,

1271
02:06:46,166 --> 02:06:48,901
but I didn`t find him.
I sent a messenger to his flat,

1272
02:06:49,034 --> 02:06:53,471
but he was told that two men 
took him away two days ago.

1273
02:07:05,861 --> 02:07:10,354
Call the Prime Minister and connect me with him.

1274
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:16,336
If he's not there, 
ask for an appointment as soon as possible.

1275
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:20,265
- Hello?
- Give it to me.

1276
02:07:21,809 --> 02:07:22,969
Höfgen.

1277
02:07:24,477 --> 02:07:28,504
Yes, I`ll would like to talk 
with the Prime Minister. 

1278
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:41,363
Good day.

1279
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:43,050
- Good day.
- Do come in.

1280
02:07:46,096 --> 02:07:47,215
Good day.

1281
02:07:49,168 --> 02:07:51,137
Well, what's going on?

1282
02:07:51,271 --> 02:07:55,798
Excellency, recently you helped me, 
on behalf of a colleague.

1283
02:07:57,543 --> 02:07:59,670
Now I have to ask again for help.

1284
02:08:01,213 --> 02:08:02,509
The thing is...

1285
02:08:03,649 --> 02:08:10,747
Otto Ulrichs was taken from his apartment
a few days ago.

1286
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:15,951
- Is this why you've come?
- Yes, Excellency.

1287
02:08:16,327 --> 02:08:21,821
I'm fed up with you, Höfgen. 
These matters are outside your competence.

1288
02:08:22,432 --> 02:08:25,266
Keep your nose out of this affair.

1289
02:08:25,737 --> 02:08:28,933
I'll give you some good advice:
Stop meddling.

1290
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:32,372
You'd do better minding your own business,

1291
02:08:32,476 --> 02:08:37,379
so you won't get crushed like a bug! 
Think you matter?

1292
02:08:38,649 --> 02:08:40,707
Ulrichs was involved in dirty work.

1293
02:08:40,817 --> 02:08:45,480
My State Theater manager ought not show 
such interest in a traitor.

1294
02:08:46,088 --> 02:08:47,113
Now go.

1295
02:08:47,624 --> 02:08:49,057
I told you to go.

1296
02:08:50,026 --> 02:08:52,153
Get out, actor!

1297
02:09:37,037 --> 02:09:41,235
I know how much I and the theater
owe to the General.

1298
02:09:41,342 --> 02:09:45,108
I also know that to a great extent 
we owe it to you.

1299
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:49,716
Dear Lotte, that's why I ask you
to intervene for Otto Ulrichs.

1300
02:09:49,816 --> 02:09:54,116
- I'm so worried.
- Worried? But he's dead.

1301
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:59,148
Didn't you know? 
As far as I know, he committed suicide.

1302
02:10:02,228 --> 02:10:03,455
Suicide.

1303
02:10:06,332 --> 02:10:10,358
He knew the risks he ran.
I think he's more to be envied.

1304
02:10:52,777 --> 02:10:58,271
The Prince of Denmark renounces rank, 
youth and love.

1305
02:10:58,415 --> 02:11:00,542
He is the savior of the North.

1306
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:06,611
The lonely knight with lofty ideals,
the ideal of purity of blood and race.

1307
02:11:06,723 --> 02:11:11,251
Hamlet is a complex character, too.
A great and simple man.

1308
02:11:11,361 --> 02:11:16,127
Despite repeating myself so soon:
He is a nordic man.

1309
02:11:16,331 --> 02:11:21,769
He kills. 
And in his self-destructing battle...

1310
02:11:23,305 --> 02:11:25,364
he shows us the way to the future.

1311
02:11:25,474 --> 02:11:30,036
He commands us to lead a pure life.
That is his bequest to us today.

1312
02:11:30,144 --> 02:11:35,412
He is not weak, 
yet actors have often portrayed him as neurotic,

1313
02:11:35,516 --> 02:11:40,544
a pathological revolutionary,
thus as a decadent type.

1314
02:11:40,655 --> 02:11:42,953
I disagree.
Hamlet is a hard man.

1315
02:11:43,057 --> 02:11:48,825
You will see him as an energetic, 
resolute hero.

1316
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:55,059
He is also a hazard for the Germans.
We constantly analyze too much.

1317
02:11:55,169 --> 02:11:58,262
For the hour demands actions,
not only thoughts.

1318
02:11:58,372 --> 02:12:00,806
Least of all corruptive reflection.

1319
02:12:01,242 --> 02:12:06,577
Hamlet is the tragic conflict
between action and inaction.

1320
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:10,773
Between hesitating, thinking and doing.

1321
02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:15,848
And we, the bearers of German culture,

1322
02:12:16,056 --> 02:12:18,524
know what to make of that.

1323
02:12:18,858 --> 02:12:21,089
Hamlet is a populist drama.

1324
02:12:21,193 --> 02:12:24,993
Neither religious, nor aristocratic, nor bourgeois,

1325
02:12:25,097 --> 02:12:27,497
but a work like the Greek tragedies.

1326
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:32,537
So we'll abolish the barrier between audience and actor.

1327
02:12:33,038 --> 02:12:37,099
Space, light, movements, sounds are everything,

1328
02:12:37,208 --> 02:12:42,111
and even the spectators merge into one great, 
common effect.

1329
02:12:42,481 --> 02:12:45,211
We must bring about total theater.

1330
02:12:45,617 --> 02:12:49,849
A theater that shocks and mobilizes.

1331
02:13:58,119 --> 02:14:02,077
It has cost 60,000 marks 
to decorate the theater for tonight,

1332
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:05,091
and it will be closed for 5 days.

1333
02:14:05,193 --> 02:14:09,288
A nice birthday party!
And we have to participate in this circus.

1334
02:14:09,397 --> 02:14:11,388
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1335
02:14:51,883 --> 02:14:53,077
Good night, Director.

1336
02:15:00,044 --> 02:15:03,537
The only place you will find 
a party like this is in Berlin.

1337
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:07,921
Very kind.
Good night.

1338
02:15:22,366 --> 02:15:25,597
Dearest Bella, we haven't met in ages!

1339
02:15:25,702 --> 02:15:28,296
Are you well? 
No homesickness from Ulm?

1340
02:15:28,406 --> 02:15:33,502
I'm sure you're fantastically well
and your great son is flourishing.

1341
02:15:42,868 --> 02:15:45,011
- Dear Höfgen, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

1342
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:48,206
- How is the party going?
- People seem to enjoy it.

1343
02:15:48,291 --> 02:15:52,784
Your Hamlet was magnificent.
The boss was quite taken.

1344
02:15:52,895 --> 02:15:58,495
After the premiere 
he spoke only of you and the theater.

1345
02:15:59,084 --> 02:16:00,485
I envy you.

1346
02:16:00,636 --> 02:16:04,231
Success is strange. 
Sometimes you have it, sometimes not.

1347
02:16:04,338 --> 02:16:08,300
No, dear Höfgen, you give people something, 
you create. 

1348
02:16:08,493 --> 02:16:10,154
Believe me.

1349
02:16:12,747 --> 02:16:13,907
Here they come!

1350
02:17:44,868 --> 02:17:48,304
- How are you, Mephisto?
- Very well, Your Excellency.

1351
02:17:49,673 --> 02:17:53,073
I haven't told you, 
how wonderful your Hamlet was.

1352
02:17:53,177 --> 02:17:56,111
I'm very glad.
Allow me to say a few words.

1353
02:17:57,314 --> 02:18:03,081
Mr. Prime Minister, Madam,
ladies and gentlemen.

1354
02:18:03,886 --> 02:18:11,156
We are proud to be able to celebrate this day 
with you in this theater.

1355
02:18:11,394 --> 02:18:13,123
Since I have the honor

1356
02:18:13,261 --> 02:18:16,128
of greeting you on behalf of everyone present,

1357
02:18:16,232 --> 02:18:20,362
I salute the statesman and soldier,

1358
02:18:20,468 --> 02:18:23,961
friend and generous patron of the arts.

1359
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:28,935
We admire him as our role model,
love him as our friend,

1360
02:18:29,076 --> 02:18:30,772
obey him as our master,

1361
02:18:30,912 --> 02:18:35,076
for without patrons,
art is a bird with broken wings.

1362
02:18:35,316 --> 02:18:39,047
As the poet says:
"May the gods protect you

1363
02:18:39,154 --> 02:18:42,247
and may the heart of Rome beat for your aims."

1364
02:18:50,129 --> 02:18:55,397
The Prime Minister wishes to speak to you, herr Höfgen. 
He`s waiting in his car. Follow me.

1365
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:57,232
You alone.

1366
02:19:01,208 --> 02:19:04,142
Nicoletta will take you home.
I won't be long.

1367
02:20:00,764 --> 02:20:04,393
Well, Mephisto, 
what power is looking down on you here.

1368
02:20:04,801 --> 02:20:06,530
Do you feel it?

1369
02:20:07,371 --> 02:20:13,172
This is theater! Look at this arena.
It's almost ready. Wonderful, isn't it?

1370
02:20:13,944 --> 02:20:16,605
This is where I'd stage a performance.

1371
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:21,677
Don't blink, Hendrik, look history in the eye. 
What an echo!

1372
02:20:24,254 --> 02:20:26,619
Hendrik Höfgen!

1373
02:20:29,959 --> 02:20:34,623
We shall rule Europe and the world.
A thousand-year Reich!

1374
02:20:34,964 --> 02:20:37,762
Hendrik Höfgen!

1375
02:20:46,875 --> 02:20:49,435
Go! Get going!

1376
02:20:53,214 --> 02:20:54,408
Into the middle!

1377
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:58,906
Hendrik...

1378
02:20:59,951 --> 02:21:03,512
Höfgen!

1379
02:21:12,834 --> 02:21:15,597
Well, how do you enjoy this limelight?

1380
02:21:17,104 --> 02:21:19,265
This is the real light, isn't it?

1381
02:21:53,605 --> 02:21:56,802
What do they want of me? 
What?

1382
02:21:57,609 --> 02:21:59,770
I'm only an actor.
