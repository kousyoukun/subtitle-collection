1
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:47,431
Eighteen centimeters
on the figure of Osiris, doctor.

2
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:48,599
Eighteen.

3
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:50,142
Very good.

4
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,353
And the representation of Nefertiti,
Professor?

5
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:55,272
Uh, 12 centimeters.

6
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,773
Excellent.

7
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,483
And the last measurement?

8
00:01:58,628 --> 00:01:59,484
Let's see.

9
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:03,322
Hathor is 11.

10
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:11,913
What is that?

11
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:15,000
Earthquake!

12
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:20,589
North wall is going!

13
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:28,096
Professor, are you injured?

14
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,349
No, I'm okay. I'm all right.

15
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:33,643
God, earthquake.

16
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:36,270
Abdullah, look.

17
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:40,524
This is unbelievable.

18
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:58,918
It's a chamber, Abdullah.

19
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:02,755
Please be careful, Professor.

20
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,276
Abdullah, this is incredible.

21
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:06,831
What have you found, my friend?

22
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:13,450
Ankh... Van... Haris.

23
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:21,583
Ankh-Vanharis.

24
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,589
Are you all right?

25
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,842
It sc...
it scared the hell out of me.

26
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,927
There's so many bodies, Abdullah.

27
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:01,831
I'm gonna need at least three of you
on each side.

28
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,250
Come on, give him a hand.

29
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:08,254
Okay, carefully.

30
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:12,024
Could you all sort of move around
to the other side of the coffin?

31
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:14,594
Linda, this is fairly heavy.

32
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:16,012
Must we pose right now?

33
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,348
Rossmore wants
a bunch of publicity stills

34
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:20,130
for their press conference tomorrow.

35
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,435
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

36
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,603
Seems we have no choice.

37
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,388
Professor, could you move over here
and smile at the mummy?

38
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:58,136
Well, these are clearly
the original seals.

39
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,763
Which means the fella inside

40
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:03,267
hasn't seen the light of day
in approximately 3000 years.

41
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,144
Okay, fellas.
One on each side.

42
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,689
Lift it carefully.

43
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:14,695
Okay, easy.

44
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,408
Put it right over there.

45
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:28,125
Perfect condition.

46
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,585
Can anyone translate the name?

47
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,170
Ankh-Vanharis.

48
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:35,924
A male cognomen.
Literally a noble traveler.

49
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,259
Uh-huh. Meaning?

50
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,095
I guess he was a visiting dignitary.

51
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:44,099
Why would they bury a foreigner
in the tomb of King Tut?

52
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:45,767
It's a good question, Michael.

53
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:49,146
Maybe we'll find the answer
in the scroll of dedication.

54
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:52,274
All right, let's go for the
inner lid now. Carefully.

55
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:55,777
Watch it, you idiot.

56
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:56,820
Sorry, doctor.

57
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:59,393
Sorry's not gonna help when
you break some of the machinery.

58
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,074
Ready for the X-ray, sir.

59
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,165
All right.

60
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,918
Carefully.

61
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:24,639
Can anyone tell me why the wrappings
are so deteriorated?

62
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,768
A hasty burial.
Minimum preparation.

63
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:30,770
Yep. I'd say that's likely.

64
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,773
What is that green stuff? Mold?

65
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:35,316
I'm not really sure.

66
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,610
Michael, why don't you collect
some samples?

67
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:38,945
Okay, doc.

68
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,492
Professor, why would he have been
given a hasty burial?

69
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,078
Well, until we remove the wrappings
and examine the body,

70
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:48,788
we're not gonna know for sure,

71
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,416
but my guess is Ankh-Vanharis
died from some kind of disease,

72
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:54,126
such as plague or smallpox.

73
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,004
Or whatever it was that disfigured
and killed his attendants.

74
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,966
Susie,
bring me an airtight container.

75
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,761
I wanna seal this up until we can
give it a proper cleaning.

76
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:20,945
Michael?

77
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,571
Just about done, doc.

78
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,049
All right.

79
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,110
All right, I think we're ready
for the x-rays.

80
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:39,797
Thank you for your help.

81
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,757
And I'll see you all later.

82
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:42,508
Okay.

83
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,677
- Thanks, doc.
- Bye.

84
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:47,263
Great stuff.

85
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:50,683
Thanks.

86
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,478
So long, Parker.

87
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,357
No, I'd like Mr. Parker to stay.

88
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:01,026
After all, he is the chief engineer.

89
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,410
Ready, aim, fire.

90
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,251
Ready, aim, fire.

91
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:26,593
Ready, aim, fire.

92
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,644
What are you doing, you moron?

93
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:38,271
Doug, look at that.

94
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,315
My god, Sharpe.

95
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,609
One of those damned kids must've
knocked it off the setting.

96
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:45,529
You've been x-raying this mummy
with 10 times the normal dose.

97
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,948
Okay.
So we'll start again.

98
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:50,116
Let's not.

99
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:51,284
It's had enough radiation
for one night.

100
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,245
Just deliver those
plates to my office.

101
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,773
That's a little over-exposed.

102
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:25,485
That's okay.

103
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,782
What the hell could those be?

104
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:07,234
Oughta be right about...

105
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,777
There.

106
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:20,097
Gotta match the dose.

107
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:26,187
Don't worry, big fella.
This isn't gonna hurt a bit.

108
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:34,237
A perfect match.

109
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:07,954
Well, if I can't get it...

110
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,133
X-rays.

111
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,597
Um, just put them over there.

112
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:28,308
I wanna finish cleaning this scroll.

113
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,234
Ah, Susie.

114
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,624
I don't know, Ken.

115
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,918
Some kinda dormant mold.

116
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:58,588
Great.
I'll have Susie run it over.

117
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,633
Yeah, thanks, Ken.

118
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:06,304
Ken Melrose in pathology can start
analyzing it right away.

119
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:08,848
Can you bring it over to him?
Do you mind?

120
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:09,766
Of course not.

121
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:12,477
Maybe he'll show me
his new electron microscope.

122
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:15,271
Well, what have I got
that can compete with that?

123
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,648
Mm.

124
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,651
Oh, honey, before you go,
what do you think of this?

125
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,903
I found it rolled up in the scroll.

126
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,739
Magic symbols?
Astrological diagram?

127
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:26,241
Look at the material.

128
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:27,909
I've never seen anything like it.

129
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:29,493
It's not papyrus.

130
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,494
It's not leather, cloth...

131
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:34,248
well, maybe you found the first
civilization to use polyester.

132
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,417
What a dismal thought.

133
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,085
Don't work too late, doc.

134
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,308
I'm sorry.
Did I startle you?

135
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,438
Oh, Susie, what time is it?

136
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,273
You're gonna look worse
than Ankh-Vanharis

137
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,900
at the press conference.

138
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,405
Susie, would you look at this?

139
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:52,576
Notice the cranial structure,
the line of the spinal column.

140
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:55,189
Maybe there's something wrong
with the X-ray machine.

141
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,663
No. No.

142
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,083
Here, coffin came out perfectly.

143
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,293
And look at this.

144
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:04,421
Usually the internal organs are
removed and prepared separately,

145
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,464
but here they're all intact.

146
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:13,137
This mummy hasn't been prepared
in a standard manner.

147
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,972
What's this?

148
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,231
Probably a hidden compartment
for personal jewelry.

149
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,107
That's not unheard of.

150
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,568
Well, we'll find out.

151
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,494
What is this stuff?

152
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,581
Don't touch it.

153
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:43,927
Get Ken Melrose and tell him
something has happened to the mold.

154
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,920
Hurry! Go on!

155
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,273
Worthless.

156
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,984
Worthless?
What do you mean, "worthless"?

157
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,610
I mean they're not precious.

158
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,905
They're 3000 years old.
They're ancient, man.

159
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,284
Well, who told you that?
Some hustler in a swap meet?

160
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,328
Forget it.

161
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,435
Clown.

162
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,464
Uh, it is the same fungus.

163
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,092
But it's definitely
no longer dormant.

164
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,344
And you have no idea what it is.

165
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:36,429
No.

166
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,473
And until we find out,
don't let anyone near it.

167
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,641
That's not gonna be easy.

168
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:43,435
Rossmore's scheduled
a press conference for today.

169
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,895
He wants to introduce Ankh-Vanharis
to the public.

170
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:47,564
Okay, doc.

171
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,649
I'll call Rossmore and tell him
he simply must cancel it.

172
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,735
Thanks, Ken.
I appreciate it.

173
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,406
Evening news.

174
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,574
Is this the stiff?

175
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,576
Michael, see if you can
find something to rope

176
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,077
the coffin off with,
please.

177
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,793
Suse, be sure everyone
stays clear of the coffin.

178
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,295
Including you.

179
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,130
Doug.

180
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:14,924
He wants to talk to you.

181
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,305
No, we don't know for sure
that it's dangerous.

182
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,233
Look, I'll get back to work on this,

183
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,569
and if I learn anything, I'll...
I'll call you.

184
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,946
Thanks, Ken. Thanks.

185
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,258
Get him to the campus hospital.
To the emergency room.

186
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,260
Call Melrose
as soon as you get there.

187
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,262
And don't touch his hand!

188
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,975
Please just, uh,
have a seat, please.

189
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,068
McCadden, what is the meaning
of all this commotion?

190
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:17,737
One of my students was just burned
by this fungus.

191
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:18,822
Fungus?

192
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,906
Come on. You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

193
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:23,283
Melrose and I tried
to warn you about this.

194
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,120
McCadden, you know
I really resent being blamed

195
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,247
for the clumsiness
of one of your students.

196
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,417
Now, if you're unwilling to accept
the responsibility for this project,

197
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,836
perhaps we ought
to find someone who will.

198
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,739
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

199
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:03,574
My name is Wendell J. Rossmore.

200
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,123
Today we are formally announcing
the permanent acquisition

201
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,587
of a major artifact from the tomb
and the treasure of Tutankhamen.

202
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,981
When we uncover the mummy, you're
gonna notice that the wrappings

203
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,234
are very deteriorated and covered
with a green substance.

204
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,153
This may make him seem
rather unattractive,

205
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,739
but please remember he's been
in there for 3000 years.

206
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,912
Gentlemen,
you may remove the inner lid.

207
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,925
Hey, look, I wasn't the only one
in the lab that night.

208
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,344
Don't you belong to a fraternity,
Sharpe?

209
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:08,304
Yes. So what?

210
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,807
Hey, Pete, I was a frat man.
I know what it's like.

211
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,517
Slow night, nothing to do.

212
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:15,394
- Have a couple of beers...
- Steal a mummy?

213
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,605
That's a great theory, captain.

214
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,606
Try to prove it.

215
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,816
Why, you little...

216
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,817
hey, listen,

217
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:22,735
why don't you ask Parker
where he was that night?

218
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,445
I saw him there.

219
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:27,657
Dr. Rossmore,
Jack Parker is not a suspect.

220
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,910
The most important thing is
we've got to find the mummy.

221
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:32,912
We've got to counteract
the bad press

222
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,414
generated by that disaster
this morning.

223
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,333
- Uh, Sharpe?
- Yes, sir?

224
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,253
I want you to spread the word
through the fraternity houses.

225
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,631
I'm offering a 24-hour amnesty
to get the mummy back.

226
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,591
Now, if he is not returned,

227
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:48,010
I am going to close every frat house

228
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:49,929
and search every room
on this campus.

229
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:52,265
Yes, sir.

230
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,310
All right.
Uh, Sharpe and Parker, you may go.

231
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,908
Captain, I think the city police
should be brought in on this.

232
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:26,591
Absolutely not.
Now, come on.

233
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,009
This is an internal affair.

234
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:29,176
We don't need 'em.

235
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:30,845
You're overreacting, Doug.

236
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,681
That mummy could be dangerous.
There is something on the wrappings.

237
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:36,808
Something very strange.

238
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,810
There's already a boy
in the hospital.

239
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,479
Anybody else who touches that
mummy could end up the same way.

240
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:44,107
If that's so,
whoever has taken the mummy

241
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:46,610
is going to end up in the hospital
sooner or later.

242
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,653
And then I'll nab 'em.

243
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:52,282
And nobody has to know about it.
Not the police, not the press.

244
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:56,411
Fine.

245
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:00,363
We'd better find that mummy
before somebody else gets hurt.

246
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,644
Hey.

247
00:25:02,914 --> 00:25:04,324
Hey, what's goin' on back here?

248
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,907
Captain Willoughby, I want you
to search the campus.

249
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:19,994
Turn it upside down if necessary,
but find that mummy.

250
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:21,912
Yes, sir.
You got it.

251
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:25,124
Here's why I'm so concerned.

252
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:28,335
The structure is just crazy.

253
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,963
The nucleus is unstable,

254
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:34,425
the chromosomal pattern
is mystifying,

255
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:37,136
and the cells are multiplying
at a rate so fast,

256
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,304
I can hardly measure it.

257
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:49,064
Yes?

258
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:52,985
We'll be right there.

259
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:56,780
Yes, whatever it is,
it's highly delatropic.

260
00:25:56,928 --> 00:26:00,075
It breaks down tissues faster than
anything we've ever encountered.

261
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:03,787
And it doubles its mass
reproductively every 65 minutes,

262
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,831
provided it has enough food.

263
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:06,957
Food?

264
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:08,751
Well, any organic tissue.

265
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,919
In this case, human flesh.

266
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:19,595
Hi, doc.

267
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:21,324
I'm sorry I screwed up your show.

268
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:23,974
It's okay.

269
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:26,303
You were upstaged
by the disappearing act anyway.

270
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:31,899
When you find that guy, I want to be
the first one that knows.

271
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:34,735
You got it.

272
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,613
Mind if I take a look at that hand?

273
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,239
Sure, doc.

274
00:26:58,403 --> 00:26:59,967
Take care of yourself, Michael.

275
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:02,845
Okay.

276
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,474
<i>Dr. Fehr, Dr. Fehr.</i>

277
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:09,227
<i>You're needed
in emergency ward number 4.</i>

278
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:13,064
<i>Please answer extension number 75.</i>

279
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:15,900
What's the prognosis?

280
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:19,904
Well, there's no
skeletal damage yet,

281
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:23,991
but the nerves, tendons,
musculature, circulatory vessels

282
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:25,576
are virtually destroyed.

283
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,662
Excuse me, Dr. Hayworth.
Mrs. Goldstein is here.

284
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:29,747
Fine.
I'll be right there.

285
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:32,583
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but I will stay in touch.

286
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:34,669
Wait a minute, doctor.

287
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:36,921
Truthfully, what can you do for him?

288
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:39,507
Amputate before it goes any further.

289
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:40,651
Ooh.

290
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:06,993
Oh... go...

291
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:08,452
what were you doing?

292
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,581
Sh... Sherri, honey,
I came over to see you.

293
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,666
Then, what were you staring
at her for, bozo face?

294
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:14,750
Ow! I don't know!

295
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:15,751
Sherri!

296
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:16,335
- Hey!
- I hate you!

297
00:28:16,482 --> 00:28:19,255
Listen... Sherri, will ya listen
for a minute?

298
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:30,724
Come on, baby.
Don't be mad.

299
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,310
I brought ya a present.

300
00:28:33,454 --> 00:28:35,437
[ Sniffs ]
What?

301
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,730
Gimme a kiss first.

302
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:38,148
No way.

303
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:41,067
No kiss, no present.

304
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:44,070
Oh...

305
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:46,615
Okay, where's my present?

306
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,054
Wow.

307
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,747
Where'd you get this?

308
00:28:53,892 --> 00:28:55,624
I found it in an old box.

309
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:29,074
Dr. Serrano?

310
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:32,077
Yeah, this is captain Willoughby.
Yeah.

311
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:34,829
Look, I'm in the
electrical supply room.

312
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:39,417
President Rossmore told me to call
you if I saw anything suspicious.

313
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:42,462
<i>This is Linda Flores
taking your requests tonight.</i>

314
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:46,508
<i>So give me a call at 662-8200.</i>

315
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:49,177
And now, to Brian from Sheilagh,

316
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:52,722
and to Christy from all the guys
at delta psi...

317
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:04,066
so this is where you hide out when
you're not taking my picture, huh?

318

Cheapest rent on campus,
right next to the reactor.

319

<i>Hi, I'm Jamie Reynolds.</i>

<i>And so am I.</i>

<i>No, I'm Dick Traveland, and this is

<i>Today, here at the
California Institute of the Sciences,</i>

to show off their new mummy,</i>

00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,423
<i>It wasn't a mummy.
It was a daddy.</i>

326
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:28,924
Oh, my god.

327
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,261
<i>No, it wasn't anything.
The coffin was empty.</i>

328
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:33,262
<i>Empty?</i>

329
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:34,406
<i>As a tomb.</i>

330
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,391
<i>I wonder how much they paid
for that thing.</i>

331
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,101
<i>Whatever it was, it was too much.</i>

332
00:30:39,248 --> 00:30:42,730
<i>Jamie, I think the Institute
is in grave trouble.</i>

333
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:43,731
<i>Oh, Dick.</i>

334
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,440
<i>Sorry.</i>

335
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:46,400
<i>At any rate, it all started
this morning</i>

336
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:47,651
<i>when Wendell J. Rossmore
of the Institute</i>

337
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:48,986
<i>called a press conference</i>

338
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:50,821
<i>to show the world their find.</i>

339
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:55,743
It's worth over a hundred bucks.
I could let you have it for say, 50.

340
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,244
Hey, where am I gonna get 50 bucks?

341
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:00,456
Hey, come on, Greg.
I know you got paid today.

342
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:02,750
Just imagine
what Ellen's gonna think

343
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:06,837
when you walk in
with a present like that.

344
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:23,562
Name your restaurant, baby.

345
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:28,817
To our love.

346
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:30,277
Forever.

347
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,157
It's nice.

348
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,089
Um, excuse me.

349
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:52,590
Sherry, I'll be right back.

350
00:31:58,073 --> 00:31:58,721
Hey.

351
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:01,933
Brother Sharpe!
Imagine meeting you here!

352
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,601
Yeah, especially
in this outrageously

353
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:06,312
expensive restaurant
with nine different kinds of forks.

354
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:09,816
How do you suppose he can afford
a place like this, brother Robinson?

355
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,651
Hey, look, it's hard to figure,
brother Vogel,

356
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,071
especially since he owes us
25 bucks apiece.

357
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:15,780
Hey, look, come on.

358
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:18,074
I need that.
I just ordered the food.

359
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,617
That's okay.
We'll pay for it.

360
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:21,077
We'll eat it, too.

361
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:23,413
Look, I'm here with Sherri.

362
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,581
Okay.
We'll eat her food, too.

363
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:27,750
Hey, listen, I know we can, uh,
share the food.

364
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:31,254
But, listen,
we have to flip for the lady.

365
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,464
Tails seems appropriate?

366
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:35,007
Hey.

367
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,301
How would you guys like
to double your money?

368
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,126
Wow.

369
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:11,836
Yeah.

370
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:14,297
You give that to a girl,
she'll never forget you.

371
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,132
Okay. It's a deal.

372
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,599
Hey, baby.

373
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,559
- Oh!
- Mm.

374
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,603
Shh.
Don't wake the baby.

375
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:32,439
I promised Miss McGinnis
I'd be really quiet.

376
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,583
Come on.

377
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:49,915
Tadaa!

378
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,458
What time are they gonna
come home?

379
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:52,834
Not until midnight.

380
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:07,557
<i>This is Linda Flores on KCIS.</i>

381
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:12,145
And now, a special message for those
naughty boys and girls

382
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,272
who took the Institute's mummy.

383
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,069
Here's my in-studio guest, our own
Professor Douglas McCadden.

384
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:21,738
Thank you very much, Linda.

385
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:25,909
To whom it may concern: The fungus
on the mummy's wrappings

386
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:27,619
is extremely dangerous.

387
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:29,663
<i>If you have come
into contact with it,</i>

388
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,791
<i>please seek
medical attention at once.</i>

389
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,795
If you discover the mummy,
do not touch it.

390
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:41,091
Call the police or the Institute
or even this radio station.

391
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:17,334
Lemme know what happens.

392
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:20,004
I promise you'll be the
first reporter on the scene.

393
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:32,266
<i>Thought I lost it
there for a minute.</i>

394
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:35,894
Guess it must've fallen out of
my pocket and into the baby's crib.

395
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:38,147
He sure liked it.

396
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,815
I hope you do, too.

397
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:42,484
Greg, it's beautiful.

398
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:46,238
Hey.

399
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:49,408
It wasn't glowing like that
when I bought it.

400
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:50,909
Oh, it's so warm.

401
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,760
Damn!

402
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:09,219
Can't you let the kid cry?

403
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:10,804
He wants his doll.

404
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:16,101
I'll be right back.

405
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:48,174
Can you treat her?

406
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:49,467
<i>Oh, Lt. Hummer,</i>

407
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:52,303
I believe you know
our pathologist, Ken Melrose.

408
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:53,554
- Of course.
- Lieutenant.

409
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:55,723
And this is Professor
Douglas McCadden of the Institute.

410
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,392
- How're you doing?
- Professor.

411
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:59,727
I've brought Lt. Plummer
up to date on everything.

412
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,145
Doctor, what about Ellen?

413
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:04,065
Well, I'm consulting by phone
with Dr. Cunningham

414
00:37:04,211 --> 00:37:06,234
of the Atlanta center
for control of disease.

415
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,403
Oh? You expecting
an epidemic?

416
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:10,613
No, but if anyone knows

417
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,408
anything about unusual disorders,
it's Atlanta.

418
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:14,992
We've sent them samples.

419
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,994
They have all of our data now,
you see.

420
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,246
And what have they come up with?

421
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,580
So far, nothing.

422
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:22,819
I understand there was a witness
to this accident involving the girl.

423
00:37:23,397 --> 00:37:25,461
Yeah, her boyfriend,
uh, Greg Hauser.

424
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,088
He's here in the hospital now.

425
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,467
Okay, Hauser.
Describe the attacker.

426
00:37:31,612 --> 00:37:34,887
Was he black? White?

427
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,262
Come on, let's hear it now!
Don't sit there! Talk!

428
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:40,393
That's enough, Willoughby.

429
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:42,478
I'll take it from here.

430
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:46,232
Hey, plummer, this kid
saw the guy who did it.

431
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:51,154
I'm trying to get a description,
but he won't cooperate.

432
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:53,906
That'll be all, captain Willoughby.

433
00:37:57,974 --> 00:38:02,081
Greg, this is Lt. Plummer
from the police department.

434
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:05,251
He wants to ask a few questions,
that's all.

435
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,587
Greg, was it?

436
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:12,549
Okay, Greg.
Just tell me what you saw.

437
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:17,387
A horrible...

438
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:19,931
Face.

439
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:24,227
Whose face, Greg?
Whose face was it?

440
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,398
Mummy.

441
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:32,402
Look, he's still in shock.

442
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:36,490
I think I'd better take him
under observation for a few hours.

443
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:38,617
Greg, come with me.

444
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:51,338
How's Michael Goldstein?

445
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:55,425
They had to amputate.
But I think they got it all.

446
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,595
Ken.

447
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,221
How's Ellen this morning?

448
00:41:06,368 --> 00:41:09,099
Uh, Dr. Hayworth wants
to try a surgical laser,

449
00:41:09,244 --> 00:41:10,559
to burn the fungus off,

450
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:14,104
just as soon as they make sure
there aren't any broken bones or...

451
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:16,065
I took a look at these x-rays
you sent me.

452
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:17,650
What did you think?

453
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:21,653
You were right.
Skeletal structure is abnormal.

454
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:26,157
An extended clavicle, oversized
sternum, displaced mastoid process...

455
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:28,284
Doug?

456
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:29,577
- Hi, Ken.
- Hi, Susie.

457
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:32,497
Ken, I want you to listen to this.
I think I'm onto something.

458
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:39,170
This scroll, it basically tells the
story of King Tutankhamen's soldiers

459
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:43,049
discovering a stranger
in the desert. All right?

460
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:44,968
Because of his unusual appearance,

461
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:47,387
the Egyptians assumed
him to be a god,

462
00:41:47,532 --> 00:41:49,555
sent to advise their own god king.

463
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:53,643
So King Tut goes
forth to greet this deity,

464
00:41:53,788 --> 00:41:56,604
<i>whom he calls "Ankh-Vanharis".</i>

465
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:59,107
<i>Now, listen to this.</i>

466
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:06,280
"All-knowing Tutankhamen reached
out to touch the weary traveler

467
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:08,908
and was sorely burned

468
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:12,161
and afflicted with a disease
that consumed his flesh."

469
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:13,579
Hm.

470
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:18,251
"Likewise were all servants who laid
soothing hands on the boy king.

471
00:42:18,398 --> 00:42:22,547
All died, save only the strange
traveler himself,

472
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,215
who lay near death
and without strength,

473
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:26,926
but who would not pass
into the afterworld."

474
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:30,263
So they simply sealed him alive
in a corner of Tut's tomb,

475
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,223
along with all
the afflicted servants.

476
00:42:34,453 --> 00:42:35,601
Tell me something.

477
00:42:35,749 --> 00:42:40,398
Are you suggesting that our fungus
is the same disease

478
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:42,567
that killed Tut and his servants?

479
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:46,279
And it's been dormant
for 3000 years?

480
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:48,406
And now it's not?

481
00:42:48,552 --> 00:42:52,744
Suppose it were true.
Okay, just suppose.

482
00:42:54,056 --> 00:42:55,621
What would we have to do?

483
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:58,749
We'd have to figure out how it was
stimulated out of dormancy.

484
00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:00,834
Then we might know how to stop it.

485
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:03,086
Well?

486
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:06,548
But, Doug,
it's an unbelievable concept.

487
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:08,884
What else have we got?

488
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:12,888
Damn it!
Have you seen this?

489
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:16,725
We look ridiculous.
We were seen on every channel.

490
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:17,726
Mm-hm.

491
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,769
And look at this.

492
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:21,772
"Where is my mummy?
A fraternity party Saturday night.

493
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:22,814
Please wear costumes."

494
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:25,108
That's all we need.

495
00:43:25,252 --> 00:43:26,777
Oh.

496
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,136
Get me Dr. Hayworth.

497
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,138
It's an emergency.
Get a hold of her!

498
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:38,918
Tell her not to X-ray Ellen winters.

499
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:41,308
Do not X-ray Ellen winters!

500
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:43,894
<i>Dr. Hayworth, call the operator.</i>

501
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:45,104
<i>Stat.</i>

502
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:49,900
Gosh.

503
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,416
- Hi, Susie.
- Hi, Stanley.

504
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:06,458
Can I talk to you for a minute?

505
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:08,252
Not right now, okay?
I'm really in a rush.

506
00:45:08,396 --> 00:45:09,628
What is it?

507
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:11,255
Are you still going out
with Professor McCadden?

508
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:13,757
I don't think that's any
of your business, Stanley.

509
00:45:13,904 --> 00:45:17,052
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a very busy schedule.

510
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:18,220
Well, look, I'm sorry.

511
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:20,639
This conversation hasn't gone
as I'd hoped it would.

512
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,600
Here, take this.

513
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:23,726
I can't take this.

514
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:26,228
Take this, think of me,
and maybe I'll see ya sometime.

515
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:28,898
Stanley!

516
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:49,293
I don't see anything.

517
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:50,878
Let's get out of here.

518
00:45:53,858 --> 00:45:54,858
What was that?

519
00:45:58,863 --> 00:46:00,054
Eh...

520
00:46:20,552 --> 00:46:22,283
Nothing but a damned door.

521
00:47:17,026 --> 00:47:19,632
Keep looking.
Somebody must've broke in.

522
00:47:22,279 --> 00:47:24,053
It's the fungus.

523
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:34,397
The mummy walks!

524
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,773
Stop it! Hey!

525
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,401
Mummy needs love.
Mummy been in box too long.

526
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,403
Get off of me!

527
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:44,073
Hey, look, man, I...
I was only kidding.

528
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,079
Hi, Jack.
How do I look?

529
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,249
Come on.

530
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:57,794
As Cleopatra would say,
"see ya later, guys."

531
00:48:11,953 --> 00:48:13,560
Did he hurt you?

532
00:48:13,705 --> 00:48:15,270
No. I'm all right.

533
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:17,564
Thanks for being there.

534
00:48:31,263 --> 00:48:33,330
Conehead!

535
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:36,583
Peter! Grow up.
Just grow up.

536
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,711
I swear, you are such a dork
sometimes.

537
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:42,047
Gross.

538
00:48:52,368 --> 00:48:53,225
Hey, baby.

539
00:48:53,373 --> 00:48:55,560
You want maybe I should make you up
like mummy?

540
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:58,063
I'm Cleopatra!
I swear...

541
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:07,072
Hey, hold it down.

542
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:11,743
You guys hear about the girl
who got lost in King Tut's tomb?

543
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:14,246
Nine months later
she was a "mummy".

544
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:33,764
Hey, Peter, I thought you were gonna
wear a costume.

545
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,474
Love your outfit, bill.

546
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:36,767
Thanks.

547
00:49:36,913 --> 00:49:38,727
Love your necklace.
It's so unique.

548
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:42,096
What'd you do, get a truck load
of those things?

549
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:45,276
Excuse us, pal.

550
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:56,579
Enough of this crap.

551
00:49:56,724 --> 00:49:58,581
Now, listen, you pervert.

552
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:03,252
You don't disappear, I'm gonna
kick your bandaged butt.

553
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:05,921
Who is that?

554
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:09,300
Just some chicken frat rat.

555
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:09,776
Hey, have you seen Sarah?
I've got a present for her.

556
00:51:09,922 --> 00:51:12,070
No.
I think she's outside.

557
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:14,906
Thanks.

558
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:20,662
Sarah?

559
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:22,956
Sarah?

560
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:29,546
Sarah, is that you?

561
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:33,883
No, she's not Sarah!
And I sure as hell ain't.

562
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:36,261
You just wanna get lost?

563
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:47,647
Sarah.

564
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:49,232
Bill.

565
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:50,400
Jeff.

566
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:52,443
Ready, Sarah?

567
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:53,945
Hey, Sarah, what is going on?

568
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:56,155
Sorry, buddy.
This is only a two-seater.

569
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:58,908
Hey, Sarah, what happened?

570
00:52:03,265 --> 00:52:04,747
Damn!

571
00:52:04,894 --> 00:52:06,541
That's it.
I'm through with women.

572
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:08,209
I'm gonna be a priest.

573
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:10,920
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

574
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:12,213
- How's it goin'?
- How are you, ladies?

575
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,423
- Nice dress.
- I like you. I'll be right back.

576
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:15,216
- Where are you goin'?
- Be right back.

577
00:52:15,361 --> 00:52:17,885
- See you later.
- All right.

578
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,542
Hey!

579
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:14,232
Look, I gotta go over to my office
and check this out.

580
00:53:14,377 --> 00:53:15,150
Can I come along?

581
00:53:15,296 --> 00:53:16,234
No, no.
I'll be right back.

582
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:19,201
Really, I just wanna see if there
was some sort of power drain.

583
00:53:21,384 --> 00:53:22,491
Be careful.

584
00:53:22,636 --> 00:53:25,911
Lock the door and keep it locked.

585
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:17,712
It was on the wall right there,

586
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:21,549
so whoever stole the mummy
must've stashed him in here.

587
00:54:24,405 --> 00:54:26,804
Oh, look who's here.

588
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,056
Come to change a lightbulb, Parker?

589
00:54:29,202 --> 00:54:31,600
No, actually, I came
to blow up the reactor.

590
00:54:32,078 --> 00:54:33,436
Hm.

591
00:55:05,696 --> 00:55:07,052
Hey, do you need any help?

592
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:08,971
Hey!

593
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:25,905
Hey, bill?

594
00:55:29,302 --> 00:55:30,576
He's dead.

595
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,715
Hello.

596
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:47,384
Yes, it's he.

597
00:55:49,532 --> 00:55:51,263
Do I have the time right?

598
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:55,058
What?

599
00:55:57,204 --> 00:55:59,229
I'll be right over.

600
00:56:21,187 --> 00:56:23,253
Ah, Professor.

601
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,463
Thought you might be interested
in this.

602
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:28,591
What happened?

603
00:56:29,403 --> 00:56:30,885
Well, we found this.

604
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:36,599
It's definitely
from the mummy's wrappings.

605
00:56:36,746 --> 00:56:38,560
Looks like somebody's
playing a very sick game.

606
00:56:38,707 --> 00:56:40,395
Please stay away from the
green stuff if there's any on him.

607
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,815
It's very dangerous.
It can be fatal.

608
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,942
I don't think the fungus killed him.

609
00:56:46,087 --> 00:56:47,569
All right, what did?

610
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:48,945
Parker did it.

611
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:50,989
- Impossible.
- Why?

612
00:56:51,135 --> 00:56:53,908
It looks like every bone
in that boy's body's broken.

613
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:55,618
There's not a mark on him.

614
00:56:55,765 --> 00:56:58,037
We figure he hit that wall
with incredible force.

615
00:56:58,183 --> 00:57:00,123
Well, Jack Parker's pretty strong.

616
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:02,125
Nobody's that strong.

617
00:57:15,616 --> 00:57:17,807
I know you, Rossmore,

618
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:20,560
and this isn't the first time
you've tried to cover something up

619
00:57:20,706 --> 00:57:23,146
because you don't wanna
smell bad in the press.

620
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:24,898
<i>I beg your pardon, Lt.</i>

621
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:28,109
You're addressing the president
of an accredited university.

622
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:30,403
Don't interfere
with this investigation.

623
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:34,281
<i>Don't withhold information.</i>

624
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:37,409
And don't play detective.

625
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,870
What about the mummy?

626
00:57:40,517 --> 00:57:42,873
Well, you look for your mummy,
doctor.

627
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:44,958
I'm looking for a murderer.

628
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:47,961
Susie and I have been researching
a theory of sorts.

629
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:50,547
First of all, I wanna warn you,

630
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:54,635
it's gonna sound very unbelievable,
but please just bear with me.

631
00:57:54,781 --> 00:57:58,555
I know it can't be proved,
but this fungus,

632
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:01,725
I think we all agree it's like
nothing else we've ever encountered.

633
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,894
I'd have to agree with that.

634
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:09,775
Suppose it was because
it didn't come from earth.

635
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,486
Where else would it
have come from?

636
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:15,739
All right, Ken, you've seen
these x-rays of our mummy.

637
00:58:15,885 --> 00:58:18,075
You said he wasn't
a normal human being.

638
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:21,870
Suppose he wasn't a human being.

639
00:58:22,014 --> 00:58:23,080
Uh, Doug-

640
00:58:23,225 --> 00:58:24,623
I said it would sound crazy.

641
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,876
Remember the scroll.

642
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:31,588
It said, "all who touched the weary
traveler became afflicted

643
00:58:31,734 --> 00:58:34,925
and died except Ankh-Vanharis."

644
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,886
Because he was immune.

645
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:39,763
Because he wasn't human.

646
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:43,558
We all agree that we're dealing
with something unknown,

647
00:58:43,706 --> 00:58:47,729
but I can't, myself, take a quantum
leap into the supernatural.

648
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:51,942
I'm sorry, Professor,
but with all due respect,

649
00:58:52,088 --> 00:58:54,444
we have to have some basis
in fact.

650
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,239
I've got the best available
equipment at my disposal,

651
00:58:57,386 --> 00:58:59,449
and I've been... I've... I've come up
with absolutely nothing.

652
00:58:59,595 --> 00:59:02,703
I mean, it simply does not exist.

653
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:05,539
Look, Doug,
the bottom line is this:

654
00:59:05,683 --> 00:59:07,082
Whatever it is,

655
00:59:07,229 --> 00:59:09,875
we still have to find
out who took it and where it is now.

656
00:59:10,023 --> 00:59:11,887
Otherwise,
more people are gonna get hurt.

657
00:59:13,525 --> 00:59:16,632
Thanks to McCadden,
we are in deep trouble.

658
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,884
Two of our donors have withdrawn
their bequests.

659
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:22,471
500,000 dollars
out the window. Aw.

660
00:59:22,618 --> 00:59:25,474
Maybe there's a way of turning
this whole thing around.

661
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:27,268
How, Bruce? How?

662
00:59:27,415 --> 00:59:29,937
- What if he stole the mummy?
- Huh?

663
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,939
He wasn't ready
to unveil that mummy,

664
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:35,401
so he had it stolen and hidden where
he could work on it in private.

665
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:38,738
And then when he's ready
to find it and unveil it,

666
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:40,566
he'll find it
and come out a big hero.

667
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:42,742
No.

668
00:59:42,888 --> 00:59:45,453
I don't think that scenario's
going to hold water, Bruce.

669
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,872
I do.
And I think I can prove it.

670
00:59:48,854 --> 00:59:51,584
You don't think it's
walking around on its own, do you?

671
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:08,726
Oh!

672
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,061
There's something out there!

673
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,313
- What?
- It's in the hall!

674
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,784
Come on, Doug.
Wake up.

675
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:32,208
What time is it?

676
01:00:32,355 --> 01:00:34,460
You've been sleeping all day.

677
01:00:34,607 --> 01:00:38,047
You must have been really tired.

678
01:00:42,529 --> 01:00:44,136
Doug, look.

679
01:00:51,204 --> 01:00:52,102
Where's that coming from?

680
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:53,394
My bracelet.

681
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,404
Suse, that looks
exactly like the diagram

682
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,739
that I found inside the scroll.

683
01:01:04,884 --> 01:01:06,074
That can't be a coincidence.

684
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,368
Susie, where'd you get
this bracelet?

685
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:12,872
Well, it was a present
from this guy named Stanley.

686
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:14,707
Do you know where it came from?

687
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,459
No.

688
01:01:16,604 --> 01:01:18,545
Susie, can you call him?

689
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:20,463
- Now?
- Yeah, honey. It's important.

690
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,715
That diagram and this crystal
have the same pattern.

691
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:24,384
They've gotta be related.

692
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:27,595
I've seen that pattern before,
I know I have.

693
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:30,640
Or something like it anyway.

694
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:34,894
When you asked me about in your
office, I couldn't remember, but...

695
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:36,646
what, hon? What?

696
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,273
I know.

697
01:01:38,418 --> 01:01:40,066
My brother used to build radios,

698
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:45,488
and I think he had diagrams
lying around that looked like that.

699
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:47,824
Radios?

700
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:50,702
Radios.

701
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:53,371
You know, maybe Parker will know.

702
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:57,375
- This was in the coffin?
- Yeah.

703
01:01:58,231 --> 01:02:02,297
It's amazing. It looks like
some kind of wiring schematic.

704
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:04,215
Like for making radios?

705
01:02:04,363 --> 01:02:07,302
Right, but what would it be doing
in a 3000-year-old coffin?

706
01:02:08,282 --> 01:02:11,139
Jack, could this have
something to do with it?

707
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:15,393
Maybe. Crystals could be
used as transmitters.

708
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:19,564
Jack, look at this.

709
01:02:25,424 --> 01:02:28,280
What's goin' on, Doug?
There must be a connection.

710
01:02:28,427 --> 01:02:32,868
If this did belong to Ankh-Vanharis,
what would he have used it for?

711
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:36,038
I mean, he couldn't have been
building radios in ancient Egypt.

712
01:02:36,184 --> 01:02:39,041
Susie, I want you to go
to the astronomy center,

713
01:02:39,187 --> 01:02:41,460
see what else you can find
on ancient phenomena.

714
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:44,922
But also, check out those
NASA information bulletins

715
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:47,299
on ultra-long-range communication.

716
01:02:49,073 --> 01:02:51,887
Honey, if you don't find anything,
come right back.

717
01:02:52,031 --> 01:02:53,388
Okay.

718
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,728
What's it printed on?
This doesn't feel like paper.

719
01:02:59,915 --> 01:03:02,105
Analysis came up a blank.

720
01:03:02,252 --> 01:03:07,569
It matches no other material,
either natural or synthetic.

721
01:03:07,714 --> 01:03:09,905
Like nothing else, huh?

722
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,033
It's like the fungus.

723
01:03:13,178 --> 01:03:14,701
And Ankh-Vanharis.

724
01:03:37,035 --> 01:03:39,059
Where's everybody?

725
01:03:39,203 --> 01:03:40,269
Field trip.

726
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:42,562
They all went to the observatory.

727
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,982
To see some comet or something.

728
01:03:45,126 --> 01:03:46,233
Thank you.

729
01:04:18,452 --> 01:04:21,809
There's definitely a connection
between the two.

730
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:24,770
It's logical, but I still don't know
what it means.

731
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:28,107
Let me have another look
at that crystal.

732
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:33,112
Susie!

733
01:06:16,942 --> 01:06:18,258
No!

734
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,977
Help! Help!

735
01:07:20,046 --> 01:07:21,737
Help! Help!

736
01:07:39,733 --> 01:07:42,466
Help! Let me out!

737
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,554
Oh!

738
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:57,266
And the next thing I remember
is waking up here.

739
01:09:58,954 --> 01:10:01,729
Okay.

740
01:10:01,876 --> 01:10:04,899
I appreciate you answering
these questions, Miss Fuller.

741
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:08,611
If you think of anything else,
give me a call, okay?

742
01:10:08,755 --> 01:10:09,904
<i>Lt. Hummer,</i>

743
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:13,366
you don't really still believe
this is a fraternity joke, do you?

744
01:10:13,512 --> 01:10:17,536
No. No, I think this is
a very sick individual.

745
01:10:17,684 --> 01:10:21,207
- But, lieutenant, it's...
- try to get some sleep now, okay?

746
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,765
Ow! Damn! Ow!

747
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:53,029
Suse, what happened?

748
01:10:53,176 --> 01:10:56,449
Doug, you know me.
I'm not the hysterical type.

749
01:10:56,594 --> 01:10:59,536
But it was him.

750
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,372
It was Ankh-Vanharis.

751
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,042
He's alive.

752
01:11:06,856 --> 01:11:10,922
He didn't wanna hurt me.
He just wanted my bracelet.

753
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:13,258
My... my crystal bracelet.

754
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,884
It was glowing.

755
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:19,431
And he... he had a crystal
just like it in his chest.

756
01:11:19,577 --> 01:11:23,393
Wasn't Ellen wearing jewelry,
some kind of necklace?

757
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:24,310
Yeah.

758
01:11:24,457 --> 01:11:26,229
So was bill Vogel,
according to the coroner.

759
01:11:26,376 --> 01:11:28,898
Susie, do you know if there's
any more of those crystals?

760
01:11:29,043 --> 01:11:30,400
No, I don't.

761
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:33,862
I'm going back to my office
and check out that schematic again.

762
01:11:34,006 --> 01:11:35,280
Go ahead. It's okay.

763
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,625
Jack.

764
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:57,635
Come on, Doug.
We got him.

765
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:04,601
He was here.

766
01:12:04,745 --> 01:12:05,809
What's that?

767
01:12:16,673 --> 01:12:17,780
How did these get here?

768
01:12:17,925 --> 01:12:20,532
One, two, three, four, five.

769
01:12:20,677 --> 01:12:23,702
- Crystals?
- Sharpe.

770
01:12:29,564 --> 01:12:31,376
- Hey!
- Where'd you get those crystals?

771
01:12:31,521 --> 01:12:32,294
What crystals?

772
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,213
The ones you've been
selling your friends.

773
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:35,631
I... I... I got 'em at the swap meet.

774
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:37,466
Sharpe, don't lie to me.

775
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:38,759
What about these?

776
01:12:39,698 --> 01:12:41,720
Ellen winters and bill Vogel
are dead.

777
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:42,971
Because of those crystals.

778
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:44,890
And Susie Fuller's in the hospital.

779
01:12:52,794 --> 01:12:55,567
I didn't mean
for anyone to get hurt.

780
01:12:59,716 --> 01:13:01,782
Where are the rest of 'em?

781
01:13:01,928 --> 01:13:03,867
There's one
in my top drawer there.

782
01:13:07,225 --> 01:13:08,872
I gave the other one
to my girlfriend.

783
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:10,374
- Sherri?
- Yeah.

784
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,293
Oh, my god.
She's Jennie's roommate.

785
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,754
All right.
Call your girlfriend right now.

786
01:13:15,898 --> 01:13:17,047
She's at work.

787
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:18,632
Call her.

788
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:46,534
Suppose he is building a long-range
communication device.

789
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:50,371
He's got the circuitry, he's got
the electrical transformer,

790
01:13:50,516 --> 01:13:52,582
he's got most of the crystals.

791
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:54,417
What else does he need?

792
01:13:55,604 --> 01:13:56,961
A power source.

793
01:14:06,198 --> 01:14:06,929
Did you find her?

794
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,890
Yes, but she doesn't have it on.

795
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:10,641
It's at home, bathroom cabinet.

796
01:14:10,785 --> 01:14:12,226
Jennie!

797
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:26,115
Bus)'-

798
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,408
I'm going over there!

799
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:30,536
All right.
I'll meet you at the reactor.

800
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:32,413
Okay, mom.

801
01:14:33,183 --> 01:14:34,790
Love to dad.

802
01:14:35,686 --> 01:14:37,627
I love you, too.

803
01:14:37,771 --> 01:14:39,253
Bye.

804
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:06,523
No.

805
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:12,780
No.
Please. No.

806
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:28,295
Linda, this is Professor McCadden.

807
01:17:28,442 --> 01:17:31,882
Get your camera and come over
to the reactor building.

808
01:17:32,026 --> 01:17:34,218
Linda, now.

809
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:37,471
Jennie! Jennie!

810
01:17:38,908 --> 01:17:40,891
Jennie.

811
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,893
Did he touch you?

812
01:17:43,037 --> 01:17:44,561
No.

813
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:47,731
He took the crystal.

814
01:18:38,676 --> 01:18:40,032
Thank you, Douglas.

815
01:18:40,553 --> 01:18:41,909
What are you guys doing here?

816
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:45,246
Proving my theory.

817
01:18:45,393 --> 01:18:46,873
I knew all along
that you'd taken that mummy

818
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:49,041
and now I know
where you've hidden it.

819
01:18:49,188 --> 01:18:51,419
- What?
- Oh, come off it, Professor.

820
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:54,964
Don't you realize
what has been going on here?

821
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:56,048
Yes, as a matter of fact.

822
01:18:56,195 --> 01:18:57,717
You've been getting away
with murder.

823
01:18:57,862 --> 01:18:59,302
Well, the game is over.

824
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:00,887
And as soon as I call
Lt. Plummer,

825
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:03,715
you'll be on your way to jail,
and I'll have what I deserve.

826
01:19:05,702 --> 01:19:07,059
Jack?

827
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:38,561
Shoot it!

828
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:47,217
No!

829
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,557
The crystal!

830
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,226
No!
