00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,524
Now this is different!

360
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,568
My Christmas wish
is coming true!

361
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,694
It'll be fun!

362
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,738
Ah, I don't need this anymore!

363
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,626
I gotta ask somebody how to
get back up the‐‐

364
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,794
Buongiorno!

365
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,881
"Buongiorno"?
That doesn't sound French.

366
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,424
Welcome to Italy!

367
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,635
Italy?!

368
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,804
Oh, frozen puddles.

369
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,890
How am I gonna get down
the mountain

370
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,641
to the city
to meet everybody?

371
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,272
Madame, maybe you'd like to
borrow this snowmobile?

372
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,775
If you hurry, you can catch
the last bus at the bottom
of the hill.

373
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,402
Thanks for the loaner!

374
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,862
I really need to get back home

00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,238
with all my friends!

376
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,615
That sounds wonderful.

377
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,701
You do know how to drive
a snowmobile, don't you?

378
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,037
Sure! Easy peasy!

379
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,789
Be careful!

No! Stop!

394
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,037
Aw, quackers!

395

Doodles! Now what?

398
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,923
I don't see Donald.

399
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,467
Or Daisy or Cuckoo Loca.

400
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,636
And it's going to be
Christmas soon!

‐Let me check my Pal Tracker.
‐[beeps]

402
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,561
Oh, no! I'm not sure the app
is working right now.

403
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,146
I'll... check it
in a little while.

404
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,940
But we better go
catch our bus.

405
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,485
Aha!

406
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,779
Golly, this station
sure is a big place.

407
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,198
Uh, let's make sure
we don't get separated.

408
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,075
Oops, sorry, Mick!

[grunts]

410
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,040
It looks like we catch our bus
down that way.

411
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,542
Huh?! Oh, no!

412

‐Oh, dear!
‐Hey, Goofy!

418
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,183
Maybe you can
use the fishing pole
to stop the cart!

419
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,186
Say, how'd you know
it was a fishing pole?!

420
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,354
Lucky guess?

421
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,774
Time to go fishin' for luggage!

‐ Yeah. The city of Rome.

‐ Italy? Is Donald
with either of you?

No, he flew away.

451
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,499
He can fly?

I forgot to mention the part
about "in a blimp."

453
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,795
I better call him.

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,339

[grunts]

719
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,387
[laughs]

720
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,560
It's time to light up
the Christmas tree!

721
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,645
Ready!

722
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,689
Three, two, one!

723
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,815
Lights!

724
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,026

00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,533
[groaning]

727
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:42,080
I put too many lights on...
again.

728
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,833
Oh, that's okay, Donald,
we're still having fun.

729
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,294
[groans] It's not that.

730
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,964
This reminds me of...
my best friends.

731
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,843
You see... Celebrating our
traditions together...

732
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:58,179
is what makes
the holiday so special.

733
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,726
[all] It's what makes
Christmas Christmas!

734
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,977
Guys!

735
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,523
Aww. It wasn't real.

736
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,900
Just my imagination.

737
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,237
[Minnie] Oh, dear.

738
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,657
There must be a way we can
all be together tonight.

739
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,869
[horn blows]

740
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:28,627
Gee, I don't know how else
to get us all home.

741
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,713
‐[beeping]
‐Wait a minute.

742
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,924
The Christmas Wishing Star
can make a wish come true!

743
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,844
I need to wish
with all my heart!

744
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,388
And Minnie said that someone
told her the Wishing Star

745
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,016
is the brightest and
most magical star of them all!

746
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,726
So...

747
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,353

[Santa] Ho ho ho ho!

791
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:47,348
‐Mickey!
‐Santa! It's you!

792
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,518
Um...
did you ever drive a taxi?

793
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,895
Ho ho ho ho!

794
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,897
I wear many hats, kiddo.

795
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,941
But this one's my favorite.

796
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,735
So climb in, Mickey!

797
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,029
You and Minnie
are getting your wish.

798
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,990
You and your pals
are going to be together

799
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,950
for Christmas!

800
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,203
So I made a good wish
after all?

801
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,621
You sure did.

802
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,748
And it came
right from your heart.

803
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,502
And that's the best wish
anyone can ever make.

804
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,420
Minnie's gonna be so happy!

805
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,713
So is everybody!

806
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,673
Now let's find your friends!

807
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,009
Up, up, and away!

808
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:32,060
I can show you where all my
friends are on my Pal Tracker.

809
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,603
Ho ho! No need.

810
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,230
I've got this, Mickey.

811
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,564
It's kinda my thing.

812
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,499
It's gonna be a lonely
Christmas without my friends.

813
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,252
Huh?

814
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,839
Oh!

815
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,971
Merry Christmas, Daisy!

816
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,723
Krerry Mistmas, Goofy!

817
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,934
You mean Mickey.
[chuckles]

818
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,228
You're... Santa... Claus.

819
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,856
Merry Christmas, Daisy!

820
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,315
Ho ho ho!

821
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,668
[sighs] Christmas without
my friends isn't merry at all.

822
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,629
Huh?

823
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,471
[Mickey and Daisy] Cuckoo Loca!

824
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,433
[gasps]
Mama Mia! Bonasera!

825
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,143
Buon Natale!

826
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,938
I spent so much time in Italy,
I speak fluent Italian!

827
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,232
Pizza? [giggles]

828
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,525
Ah!

829
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,404
Up, Dasher! Up, Dancer!

830
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,531
Ho ho ho ho!

831
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,743
[cheering and chatter]

832
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,997
[sighs]

833
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,835
Another round of
"Jingle Bells," Donald?

834
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,211
No, thank you.

835
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,504
Are you okay?

836
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,506
You're all very nice but‐‐

837
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,926
I miss my best friends.

838
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,220
We were supposed to
spend Christmas together.

839
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,640
I think not being with your
best friends

840
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,643
is making you realize
just how much they mean to you.

841
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,811
[sighs] You're right.

842
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,980
I wish they were here.

843
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,567
[Daisy] We are, Donald!

844
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,029
Oh, no, I'm not
falling for that again!

845
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,282
Santa and my pals.

846
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,952
Just my imagination.

847
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,787
Hi, Donald!

848
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,538
You're all really here?

849
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,748
Hiya, Donald!

850
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,042
Ho ho!

851
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,002
And Santa, too?!

852
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,380
This time your wish
came true, Donald!

853
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,423
It was made
right from your heart.

854
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,217
Merry Christmas!

855
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,011
Oh, boy! Is it ever!

856
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,721
Hey, I know you!

857
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,015
You're the fella
from the chalet.

858
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,976
And the train to‐‐

859
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,894
[blabbers] I should've known.

860
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,145
Goodbye, Jenny!

861
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,064
Goodbye, Henry!

862
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,150
I'm going home to celebrate
with my best friends.

863
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,611
Have a Merry Christmas!

864
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,488
We will! Goodbye!

865
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,906
[both] Oh‐‐ what?!

866
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,492
[Santa] Ho ho ho!

867
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,036
[both gasp]
That was Santa Claus!

868
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,038
[Santa] Merry Christmas!

869
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,419
And one for you,
and one for you!

870
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,379
And one for you!

871
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,507

[sighs] Oh, my.

883
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,136
No reason to make bows

884
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,181
because there's no one
to give any presents to.

885
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,183
[sighs]

886
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,771
Merry Christmas, Mickey.
Daisy. Donald. Goofy.

887
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,522

I couldn't be happier
to see you all!

895
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:13,549
Oh, Mickey, you made our
Christmas wishes come true.

896
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,510
