1
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,080
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

2
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,040
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.

3
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,080
- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,040
Why don't you jam it down her throat?

5
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,120
It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,080
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,120
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,040
I won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.

9
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
Come now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

10
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,120
Not this time, you won't!
I'm already married to him.

11
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,080
You'll never live
under the same roof with him.

12
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,040
I'll see to it.

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Get it through your head,
King Westley and I are married!

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,080
Definitely, legally, actually married!
It's over, it's finished.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,120
There's not a thing you can do about it.
I'm over 21 and so is he.

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,080
While you've been onboard...

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,040
...I've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,080
Annulled. I'll have something to say
about that and so will King.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I expect him to.

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,120
The vittles. Come in.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,040
I told you not to bring any food in here.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,080
Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Put it down here.

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,080
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,120
Strategy, my dear.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away...

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,080
...from the Justice of the Peace?

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,120
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,120
I've won many arguments that way.

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,040
You're always telling me what not to do.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,080
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
All right, scream.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Let me off this boat or I'll break
every piece of furniture in here!

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Here, now.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Just smell it. It's a poem.

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Lower the boats! Catch her!

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Come on, men!

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
She got away, sir.

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,040
Of course, she's too smart for you.

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,080
Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,120
"Daughter escaped again.

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,080
"Watch roads,
airports and train stations in Miami."

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,040
All aboard!
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,040
...New York, Philadelphia.

49
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,040
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,080
Heel, boy.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I can't stand this any longer.

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,080
In a pig's eye, you will.

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,040
Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound...

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,080
...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.

55
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,120
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,120
I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna write it in Greek?

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,080
I'd start a new department.

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,120
That was free verse,
you gas house palooka.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,080
What was free about it?
It cost this paper a gob of dough.

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
And it's not going to cost us any more!

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Gordon.

62
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Did you know he reversed the charge?

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
What? Why you...

64
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,040
When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,040
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,040
What'd he say?

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,120
So, you're changing your tune?

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
You're late with your apologies.

69
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,080
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!

70
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
I hope this'll be a lesson to you.

71
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,040
Did we tell that baby?

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,120
- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete.

73
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
I guess he knows now,
how I feel about his job.

74
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
I bet he does, too.

75
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,080
Is my chariot ready?

76
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,120
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth,
mighty King.

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Make way for the king.

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Long live the king.

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,120
Philadelphia, all aboard!

81
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
Step down Marty, King is back.

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,040
On the rack in the back.
It's your goodbye chariot.

83
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,080
Make hams of you and scram!

84
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
Two thousand miles is a long trip.

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,080
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

86
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Pillow, sir?

87
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Driver! If you'll be good enough
to move those newspapers, I'll have a seat.

88
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,120
Hey, wait a minute!

89
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,080
What do you think you're doing?

90
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
The papers. What's the idea of
throwing them out?

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,040
The papers? It's a long story, my friend.

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,080
I never did like the idea
of sitting on newspapers.

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,120
I did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,080
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

95
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,040
They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.

96
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,040
A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.

97
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,120
Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but I do.

98
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
I always wear it out in the open so...

99
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
...if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.

100
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,080
Yeah?

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,040
Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Our conversation could have been over
long ago.

103
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,080
Yeah?

104
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,080
If you keep that up,
we won't get anywhere.

105
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,120
Yeah?

106
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,120
You got me. Yeah!

107
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.

108
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,040
I beg your pardon?

109
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,120
Now listen,
I put up a stiff fight for that seat.

110
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,120
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.

111
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,040
Driver, are these seats reserved?

112
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,080
- No. First come, first serve.
- Thank you.

113
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,120
These seats accommodate two people,
don't they?

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

115
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Thank you.

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,080
Move over.

117
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,080
This is a "maybe they do."

118
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,120
If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.

119
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.

120
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Get some! Come on, everybody!

121
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,080
Hot dogs, folks!

122
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,120
Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.

123
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,080
Red hot coffee!

124
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,120
Right around there.

125
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!

127
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
He got away.

128
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,120
I found myself in the middle of brush
and no sign of the skunk.

129
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,040
I don't know what you're raving about,
young man.

130
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,080
- Furthermore, I'm not interested.
- Well of all the...

131
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.

132
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,120
My heavens! It's gone!

133
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,080
I knew you'd catch on eventually.

134
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,120
- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

135
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,080
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.

136
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.

137
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,040
No, I can't.

138
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,080
- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.

139
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.

140
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,120
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.

141
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,080
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!

142
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,120
That's silly.
The company will take care of it.

143
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?

144
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I want to be left alone.

145
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,120
Why, you ungrateful brat.

146
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,080
Board!

147
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,080
All aboard!

148
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,040
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.

149
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,080
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.

150
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,120
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

151
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Read all about it!

152
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm so sorry.

153
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,080
Silly, isn't it?

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Why, everybody's gone!

155
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,120
Thank you for that, very much.

156
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,120
- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
- Yes.

157
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,120
That was foolish of me.

158
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Why didn't you shove me away?

159
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,080
I hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.

160
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,120
How about some breakfast?

161
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,120
No thank you. No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

162
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,080
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.

163
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,120
No, they'll wait for me.

164
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Be sure to wait for me.

165
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Yeah?

166
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes.

167
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Where's the bus to New York?

168
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,080
It left about 20 minutes ago.

169
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,120
But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

170
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,080
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

171
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Good morning. Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

172
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,120
Seems to me,
I've already thanked you for that.

173
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,080
What time's the next bus?

174
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,120
8:00 tonight.

175
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,040
8:00? That's 12 hours.

176
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,080
Sorry, miss.

177
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
What's wrong?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

178
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,120
Why are you so excited?
You missed it, too.

179
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Yeah, I missed it too.

180
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,040
Don't tell me you did it on my account.

181
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,080
I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is...

182
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,120
Young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

183
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I can take care of myself.

184
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,080
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here's your ticket.

185
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,040
My ticket?

186
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,040
I found it on the seat.

187
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Thank you.
It must have fallen out of my purse.

188
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,120
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

189
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,120
- What are you talking about?
- You won't get away with it.

190
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,040
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

191
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
You must have me confused
with someone else.

192
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.

193
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
I've always been curious to know...

194
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,120
...what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.

195
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Take my advice. Grab the next bus back
to Miami. That guy's a phoney.

196
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,080
I didn't ask for your advice.

197
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,080
That's right. You didn't.

198
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,120
You're not going to notify my father,
are you?

199
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,080
What for?

200
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,040
You probably could get
some money out of him.

201
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,080
I never thought of that.

202
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,080
If you promise not to do it,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

203
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
You won't gain a thing by giving me up.

204
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
I'm willing to make it worth your while.

205
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,120
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

206
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,080
It's very important to me.

207
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
I'd pay you now, only...

208
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,120
...all I had when I jumped off
the yacht was a watch.

209
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
I had to pawn it to get these clothes.

210
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,080
I'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.

211
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,120
Never mind.

212
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,080
I had you pegged right from the jump.

213
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,120
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.

214
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,040
You're in a jam and all you can think of is
your money. It never fails, does it?

215
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,080
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

216
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,040
No, you wouldn't.

217
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,080
It never occurred to you to say...

218
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,080
..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

219
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,120
That'd bring you down off your high horse.

220
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,040
I'll tell you something to ease your mind.

221
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
You don't have to worry about me.

222
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,080
I'm not interested in your money
or your problem.

223
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,080
You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.

224
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,080
You send telegrams here?

225
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,080
I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?

226
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,040
"To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

227
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,080
"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.

228
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,080
"I know where Ellen Andrews is."
No, do you really?

229
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,120
Go on. Send the telegram.

230
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,080
"How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of..."

231
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,120
Mush.

232
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.

233
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,120
"What I said about never writing
another line for you still goes.

234
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,080
"Are you burning? Peter Warne."

235
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
That'll be $2.60.

236
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
- Send it collect.
- Collect?

237
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Collect.

238
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,120
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...

239
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,120
...Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York...

240
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.

241
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,080
Gets tiresome.
Especially for somebody like you.

242
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
You look like you've got class.

243
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Yes, with a capital "K". I'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.

244
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.

245
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,120
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.

246
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Shapeley's the name
and that's the way I like them.

247
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,040
You made no mistake sitting next to me.

248
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Most girls you meet on the bus...

249
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,080
...ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.

250
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,080
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

251
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,120
You can't be too particular, neither.

252
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,040
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?

253
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,080
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

254
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,080
That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance."

255
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.

256
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,080
Looks like you're one up on me.

257
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,080
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

258
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,120
...that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.

259
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
That's what I always say.

260
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,040
Yes, sir.

261
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,040
When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.

262
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,080
Now you're just my type.

263
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,120
Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.

264
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,120
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me.
With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.

265
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

266
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,080
Looks like you're two up on me now.

267
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Hey, you.

268
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,120
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

269
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,040
I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

270
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
- Your wife?
- Yes.

271
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Come on.

272
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,080
Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, I was just...

273
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,120
Sure. Excuse me, miss.
I was just trying to make things pleasant.

274
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Excuse me, I...

275
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,120
I didn't mean anything, Doc.

276
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,120
- No offence, Doc.
- No.

277
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,040
If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.

278
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.

279
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,120
What'd you do all day?

280
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.

281
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,040
Your clothes are all wet.

282
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,080
Here.

283
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
You're as helpless as a baby.

284
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Thank you.

285
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

286
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Here, boy.

287
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,080
- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.

288
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,120
- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But...

289
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,120
- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.

290
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,080
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!

291
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,120
$1.60.

292
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,120
You had $4 last night.

293
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
How will you get to New York at this rate?

294
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,080
That's none of your business.

295
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,120
You're on a budget from now on.

296
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,120
- Just a minute. You can't...
- Shut up.

297
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,120
- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.

298
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,080
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

299
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
If any passengers want a place to sleep...

300
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,040
...you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

301
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,080
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

302
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,120
Dyke's Auto camp.

303
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,120
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

304
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Are you talking to me?

305
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.

306
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Hey! Come on, we're all set.

307
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.

308
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?

309
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Darn clever, these Armenians?

310
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,080
Yeah, it's a gift.

311
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,080
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.

312
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,120
Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.
I registered as Mr. And Mrs.

313
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,080
You did?

314
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,080
What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?

315
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,040
I kind of half expected you to thank me.

316
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

317
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?

318
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,040
You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.

319
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,120
Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?

320
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,040
Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.

321
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,080
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

322
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,080
You're just a headline to me.

323
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
A headline?

324
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,120
You're not a newspaper man, are you?

325
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Chalk up one for your side.

326
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?

327
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,120
All right, I'm here to help you.
What I want is your story.

328
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.

329
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,040
I need that story.
Between you and me, I've got to have it.

330
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Isn't that just too cute.

331
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,080
There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?

332
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,120
You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. Including this.

333
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,120
This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.

334
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,040
These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...

335
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,040
...but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.

336
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.

337
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,080
It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.

338
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
But I'm going to follow you.

339
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
Yeah.

340
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,080
And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.

341
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,120
Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.

342
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,040
A simple story for simple people.

343
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,040
You behave yourself,
I'll see you get to King Westley.

344
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,120
If not,
I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.

345
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,040
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?

346
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,040
This one? All right.

347
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,040
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

348
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,120
This?

349
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I like privacy when I retire.
Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.

350
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Prying eyes annoy me.

351
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,120
Behold the walls of Jericho.

352
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,080
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.

353
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,120
But a lot safer.

354
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,080
You see, I have no trumpet.

355
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,120
Now to show you
my heart's in the right place...

356
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,080
...I'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.

357
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,120
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

358
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,080
You don't want to join the Israelites?

359
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,080
All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

360
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,120
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

361
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
No two men do it alike.

362
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,080
I once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

363
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Now he made a picture.

364
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.

365
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,080
I have a method all my own.

366
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,080
If you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.

367
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,120
Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.

368
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
There's where I'm different.

369
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,080
I go for the shoes next.

370
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,080
First the right. Then the left.

371
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,080
After that, it's every man for himself.

372
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,040
Still with me, brat?

373
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,080
Don't be a sucker.

374
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,080
A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.

375
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.

376
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,080
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

377
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,120
"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
The big bad wolf

378
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,080
"The big bad wolf

379
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,080
"She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la"

380
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,120
Would you mind please,
putting out the light?

381
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,120
No, not at all.

382
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,080
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

383
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Excuse me.

384
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,080
By the way, what's your name?

385
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
What's that?

386
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,040
Who are you?

387
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,080
Who, me?

388
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,120
I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.

389
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,040
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

390
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,040
You've got a name, haven't you?

391
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,120
Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.

392
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Peter Warne.

393
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I don't like it.

394
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

395
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,120
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

396
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,120
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

397
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,120
- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?

398
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,120
It's from Charleston.
"Checking every northbound train.

399
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
"Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.

400
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,040
"No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.

401
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,080
"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."

402
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,120
It's just the same as all the others.

403
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,120
- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.

404
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,040
- What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.

405
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
- All right, step on it.
- Yes, sir.

406
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,120
I hope she's all right.

407
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,080
All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?

408
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,080
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.

409
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Hello?

410
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Hey, mister.

411
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Hello.

412
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,040
What's the matter, you not up yet?

413
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,080
- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.

414
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,080
It's a toothbrush, thanks.

415
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,080
My dress, you had it pressed.

416
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,120
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

417
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,080
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

418
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,080
I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then...

419
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
...I'll drag you out myself.

420
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,080
- One, two, three, four, five...
- I really think you would!

421
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,040
I'm out! I'm out!

422
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,120
You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.

423
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,080
Outside?

424
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,040
All the best homes have them outside.

425
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,080
I can't go out like this.

426
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,080
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

427
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,080
Here, use mine.

428
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,120
Thanks.

429
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
Make it snappy.

430
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,040
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.

431
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,040
- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

432
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Where'd you say the showers were?

433
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,120
Here's a towel.

434
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,080
Thank you.

435
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,120
You're kind of little, aren't you?

436
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,080
Where's the shower?

437
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,120
Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.

438
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,120
I'll find it myself.

439
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
Are the showers in there?

440
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
They ain't out here.

441
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Thank you.

442
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?

443
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,040
You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

444
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,080
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?

445
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
Say, I'm sorry about last night.

446
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.

447
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
High time you got back.

448
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,080
I met some very interesting women
at the showers.

449
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,080
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

450
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,120
Come on. Sit down.

451
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,040
My, my. Scrambled eggs.

452
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

453
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Any complaints?

454
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,080
No. No complaints.

455
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,120
I'd have cream for your coffee,
but I'd be buying a whole pint.

456
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
You don't have to apologise to me.

457
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,040
You don't know how much
I appreciate all this.

458
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,120
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

459
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,080
Must be the spring.

460
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,080
I thought maybe "believe you me"
told you some more snappy stories.

461
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,080
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.

462
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.

463
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,120
- Donut?
- Thanks.

464
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,040
You think this whole business is silly?

465
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,080
Running away and all.

466
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,120
No. Makes too good a story.

467
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Yes, you do.
You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

468
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,040
Perhaps I am.
Although, I don't see how I can be.

469
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,120
Spoiled people are used to
having their way.

470
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,040
I never have. On the contrary.

471
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,120
I've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.

472
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Can you believe, this is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man?

473
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Yeah.

474
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,040
It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

475
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,120
You're doing all right.

476
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,080
Thanks.

477
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.

478
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,080
One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.

479
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,080
It has its moments. It's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.

480
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,040
I did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

481
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,040
It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.

482
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,120
It didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.

483
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,120
I was so mad, I ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car I saw.

484
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,040
Guess who was in it?

485
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Santa Claus?

486
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Ghandi?

487
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,120
King Westley was in it.

488
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,080
- Is that how you met him?
- Yes.

489
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,040
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

490
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,040
By 6.00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.

491
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,120
Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?

492
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,080
Now don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.

493
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,120
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.

494
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,040
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.

495
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,120
You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.

496
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,080
It's all a matter of timing.
I'll write a book about it.

497
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,120
Thanks, professor.

498
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,080
Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.

499
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,120
I'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.

500
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,080
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

501
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,080
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.

502
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,120
How do I know you're detectives?

503
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,120
Show him your credentials, Mac.

504
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Detectives.

505
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,080
That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?

506
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.

507
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,120
Get yourself all mussed up.

508
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.

509
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,040
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.

510
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,080
She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.

511
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,120
What are you talking about?

512
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,080
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

513
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,080
She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

514
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,080
Come in.

515
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,120
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?

516
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

517
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,080
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

518
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,120
Who, me? You wanna see me?

519
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
What's your name?

520
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,080
- Are you addressing me?
- Yeah. What's your name?

521
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,040
Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.

522
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,080
What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?

523
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,120
- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.

524
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,080
This isn't a public park.

525
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,120
I got news to take a sock at you.

526
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,040
- Take it easy.
- The men are detectives.

527
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Even if they're the
whole police department...

528
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,080
...they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.

529
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.

530
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,120
Is that so? How many times
have I told you not to butt in?

531
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,040
You don't have to lose your temper!

532
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,120
As usual. Every time I try to protect you.

533
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,080
At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.

534
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
He did not! I told you a million times.

535
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,040
He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.

536
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
He didn't. You were drunk.

537
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,080
Nuts! Just like your old man.

538
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

539
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.

540
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,040
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!

541
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,080
- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?

542
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,120
Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.

543
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,080
We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.

544
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.

545
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,120
Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.

546
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,080
Quit bawling!

547
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,080
I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.

548
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,120
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.

549
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,120
- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.

550
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
We could start a two-people
stock company.

551
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,080
Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.

552
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."

553
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,120
What about "Cinderella" or
a real hot love story?

554
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,080
No, too mushy.

555
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,120
I like mushy stuff.

556
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,040
Quit bawling!

557
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,080
Bus leaves in five minutes!

558
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,120
- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.

559
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.

560
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.

561
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,120
This is the last session...

562
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,120
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

563
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,120
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

564
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,120
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?

565
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,080
"Have I got a story. Stop.
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.

566
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,120
"Hope you're the same."

567
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,120
- Collect?
- Yes.

568
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,040
- Lf you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,120
And that gives me an idea for all of you.

570
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,120
I want action, Lovington, action.

571
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,120
- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.

572
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,120
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.

573
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,040
- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.

574
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,080
Send in Clark and Brown.

575
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,120
- You sure she isn't with King Westley?
- No.

576
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,120
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.

577
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,040
He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.

578
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.

579
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
I don't think so.

580
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.

581
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,120
Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of...

582
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,120
...$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.

583
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,040
Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.

584
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,080
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

585
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,120
Wire this to them.
I want the story to break right away.

586
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:19,120
Now we'll get some action!

587
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,120
Fine, that's fine.

588
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,120
You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?

589
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Yeah.

590
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,040
"Once I was happy
but now I'm forlorn

591
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,080
"Like an old coat
that is tattered and torn

592
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,040
"Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn

593
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,040
"Betrayed by a maid in her teens

594
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,080
"This maid that I loved
she was handsome

595
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,120
"And I tried all I knew how to please

596
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,040
"But I never could please her
one-quarter so well

597
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,120
"As the man on the flying trapeze

598
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,120
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

599
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,120
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

600
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,080
"His actions are graceful,
all the girls he does please

601
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,080
"And my love he has stolen away"

602
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,080
I know the second verse there.

603
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,040
"Now he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse

604
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,040
"His eyes would undress
every girl in the house

605
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,040
"Perhaps he is better described as a louse
And still people came just the same

606
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,040
"Now he smiles from the bar
on the people below

607
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,120
"And one night he smiled on my love

608
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,120
"She blew him a kiss

609
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,120
"And she hollered bravo
And he hung by his schnozzle from above

610
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,080
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

"All the girls he does please
And my love he has stolen away"

613
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Do you mind if I take the third one?

614
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,120
"I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks

615
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,120
"While she spent her time
with the circus' freaks

616
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,120
"The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

617
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,120
"Alas, Alack and Alaska

618
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,080
"I went to this fellow
the villain, and I said

619
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,120
"I'll see that you get your deserts

620
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,080
"His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer

621
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,080
"He sneered once again and said no

622
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,120
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

623
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,040
"That daring young man
on the flying trapeze

624
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,120
"His actions are graceful
The girls he does please

625
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:39,120
"My love he has stolen away"

626
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,120
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.

627
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,120
It's the first comfortable position
I've been in all night.

628
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,040
"She flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

629
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,080
"The daring young..."

630
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,080
What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.

631
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,120
Something happened to her.

632
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,120
Look how pale she is.

633
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,080
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.

634
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,080
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

635
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,120
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

636
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,120
What happened to your money?

637
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,120
Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.

638
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,120
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

639
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,120
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

640
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:41,120
...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.

641
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,120
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

642
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,120
The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.

643
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,040
I shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.

644
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,120
Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.

645
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
No, but you might need it.

646
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,120
Come on.

647
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,080
I got millions.

648
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
Here.

649
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:08,080
- Thanks.
- Come on, go back.

650
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,120
Better phone for some help.

651
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,120
Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.

652
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,040
Yeah?

653
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,080
Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?

654
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,080
Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

655
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,040
Take that story there, for instance.

656
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,120
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

657
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,080
No.

658
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,120
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.

659
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Why?

660
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,120
Because I don't believe in hogging.

661
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,040
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

662
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,040
That's what I always say.

663
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,080
What's on your mind?

664
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:03,080
Five G's or I crab the works.

665
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,080
Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.

666
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:14,080
I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.

667
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,040
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man I need.

668
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,080
- You made no mistake, believe me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

669
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,080
- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?

670
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,080
Huh?

671
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,040
A gat. A rod.

672
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,040
- Got any fireworks on you?
- No.

673
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,120
I got a couple of machine guns
in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.

674
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,040
May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.

675
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,080
If you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.

676
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,120
I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.

677
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
Killer?

678
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,120
Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.

679
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,040
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

680
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,080
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

681
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,120
$10, 000? Chicken feed.

682
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,080
Now listen, we're holding that dame
for a million smackers.

683
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,040
Say, I didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, I've got...

684
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,080
What's the matter? You getting yellow?

685
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,120
I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids.
I can't afford to get...

686
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,120
Pipe down your mug before I...

687
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,120
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

688
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,040
Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?

689
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,080
You know too much.

690
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
I won't say anything, honest I won't.

691
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,080
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

692
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,080
- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

693
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,080
Yeah?

694
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,120
What's your name?

695
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,120
Oscar Shapeley.

696
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,040
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

697
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Got a couple of kids?

698
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,080
Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.

699
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,080
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

700
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
You wouldn't. You're not thinking of...

701
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,120
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure.

702
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,080
- Lf you don't...
- I'll keep my trap shut. I will.

703
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,080
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

704
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,120
Bugs Dooley? No.

705
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,120
He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.

706
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,040
Got a little too talkative.

707
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,040
- You know what happened to his kid?
- No.

708
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,120
I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.

709
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,120
That's terrible.

710
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,120
He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. I never talk.

711
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,040
I never say a word. Word of honour.

712
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,040
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

713
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,080
Okay. Just remember that.

714
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Now beat it.

715
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,120
Sure, mister. Thanks.
I always knew you guys were...

716
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,080
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

717
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,120
Sure. Anything you say.

718
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,120
- You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
- Lf you don't beat it...

719
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,120
I'm going.

720
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,120
What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?

721
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,080
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

722
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:01,080
Why?

723
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,080
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.

724
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,120
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

725
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,120
Why did we have to leave the bus?

726
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:19,080
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

727
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,080
I've been doing a little thinking myself.

728
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,080
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

729
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,080
What's the matter, are you weakening?

730
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,080
No. I was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.

731
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
Did you give that child all your money?

732
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,080
I gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.

733
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,080
All the money I had was that ten spot.

734
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,120
So I've been thinking
you better wire your father.

735
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,120
No, sir. I started out for New York
and I'm going to get there...

736
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,080
...if I have to starve all the way.

737
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Okay.

738
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,120
What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?

739
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,080
Here, take these.

740
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,080
- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?

741
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:04,080
Get up on the log.

742
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
I wish you'd stop being playful.

743
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,080
So sorry. You know, this is the first time
in years I've ridden piggyback.

744
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,040
This isn't piggyback.

745
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,120
- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.

746
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,120
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

747
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,120
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

748
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,040
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

749
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,120
My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.

750
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,120
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

751
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,120
I never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.

752
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,040
You're prejudiced.

753
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,080
Show me a good piggy backer.
I'll show you a real human.

754
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,120
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.

755
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:55,080
Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

756
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,080
My father was a great piggy backer.

757
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,080
Here, hold this a minute.

758
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,040
Thank you.

759
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,080
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

760
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,040
This looks like the best spot.

761
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,040
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

762
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,080
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.

763
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,120
Peter?

764
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,080
What?

765
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,040
I'm awfully hungry.

766
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,040
It's just your imagination.

767
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,080
No it isn't.

768
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,120
I'm hungry and scared.

769
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,080
You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.

770
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,120
Well, I am.

771
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,040
If you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.

772
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,080
Not if you're more hungry than scared.

773
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,080
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.

774
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,120
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

775
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,080
Holy smoke!
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

776
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,080
If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.

777
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,080
What about your story?

778
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

779
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,080
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

780
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,120
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.

781
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,040
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

782
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,080
- Then take them off.
- What?

783
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,080
All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.

784
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,040
You're becoming awfully
disagreeable lately.

785
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,040
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

786
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:19,040
If being with me is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.

787
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,080
You can leave any time you see fit.

788
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,120
Nobody's holding you here.

789
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,120
I can get along.

790
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,120
Peter?

791
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,120
Peter!

792
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

793
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,040
What's got into you? I left for a minute
to find you something to eat.

794
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,120
I know but...

795
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,080
Here, eat your head off.

796
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,040
I don't want it now.

797
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,120
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but...

798
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,120
But what?

799
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,120
I was so scared, it scared the hunger...

800
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:08,120
Holy jumping catfish.
You drive a guy crazy.

801
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,080
It's liable to get chilly before morning.

802
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:55,080
Better use this.

803
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,080
What are you thinking about?

804
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,040
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

805
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

806
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,080
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

807
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,120
What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?

808
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,080
Hitchhiking.

809
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,040
You've given me a very good example
of the hiking.

810
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,120
Where does the hitching come in?

811
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,120
It's a little early yet. No cars out.

812
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,120
If it's the same to you...

813
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:37,120
...I'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.

814
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,080
You got a toothpick?

815
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,080
- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.

816
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,080
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here, I got a penknife, though.

817
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,080
Now hold still.

818
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:59,040
- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?

819
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,080
All right, now hold still.

820
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,120
Here. Get it?

821
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,080
Thanks.

822
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,040
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?

823
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:15,040
You needn't rub it in.

824
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,080
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

825
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,120
- Raw?
- Want one?

826
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,080
No. Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

827
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:28,120
That's right, I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

828
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,040
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

829
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,080
Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

830
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,120
I hate the horrid things.

831
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,080
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.

832
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,120
And suppose nobody stops for us?

833
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,040
They'll stop all right. It's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.

834
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,120
And you're an expert I suppose.

835
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,120
Expert. And I'll write a book
about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

836
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,120
There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?

837
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,080
- You think it's simple?
- No.

838
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,120
Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?

839
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:06,080
Some people do it like this. Or like this.

840
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,040
All wrong. Never get anywhere.

841
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
The poor things.

842
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,120
But that old thumb never fails.
It's all a matter of how you do it, though.

843
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,080
Now you take No. 1, for instance.

844
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,120
That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.

845
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,080
You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.

846
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,120
- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.

847
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,080
Smile goes with this one, like this.

848
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:33,040
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

849
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,080
You figured that out all by yourself?

850
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,120
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.

851
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,080
When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.

852
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:46,040
It's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.

853
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,040
That's amazing.

854
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,080
But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.

855
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,080
Here comes a car.

856
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,080
Okay. Now watch me.
I'm gonna use No. 1.

857
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,080
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.

858
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,120
I still got my eye on the thumb.

859
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:09,040
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try No. 2.

860
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,040
When you get to 100, wake me up.

861
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,080
I don't think I'll write that book after all.

862
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,040
Think of all the fun you had, though.

863
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,080
You mind if I try?

864
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,080
You?

865
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,120
Don't make me laugh.

866
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,120
You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

867
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,080
I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.

868
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,120
What are you gonna do?

869
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:18,120
It's a system all my own.

870
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,080
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?

871
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,120
What for?

872
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,040
I proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.

873
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,120
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

874
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,120
I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.

875
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,120
So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.

876
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:00,120
But if I was young, that's the way
I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.

877
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,120
Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway

878
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,040
"Of love on a honeymoon

879
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:14,040
"Hitchhiking down the highway, down"

880
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,080
Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

881
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,080
Tonsil? Me? No.

882
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:33,080
Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"

883
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,080
All right, let it go.

884
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:41,080
"Turn"

885
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,080
How about a bite to eat?

886
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,120
- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.

887
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,120
Young people in love are never hungry.

888
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,120
No.

889
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,120
"Young people in love

890
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,120
"Are very seldom hungry

891
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:05,120
"People in love are very seldom hungry"

892
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,080
What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?

893
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,080
Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.

894
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,080
Eat a carrot.

895
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,120
No.

896
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,080
I'm going in to ask him.

897
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,080
You do and I'll break your neck.

898
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:37,120
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

899
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,080
I'm sorry...

900
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:07,080
That's all right.

901
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,080
Hey! Come here!

902
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:23,080
You've got my suitcase!

903
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,120
What happened to you? I was worried.

904
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,040
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

905
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,040
Well, what happened?

906
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,080
A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.

907
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,120
How'd you get the car?

908
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:57,120
I gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.

909
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,080
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

910
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,040
Gotta start promoting some.

911
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,080
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

912
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:41,080
That'll be good for ten gallons.

913
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,080
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

914
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,080
I don't like you. Never have. Never will.

915
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,080
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?

916
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,120
You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.

917
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,120
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

918
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,080
Ellie and I got married
because we love each other.

919
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,120
She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.

920
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:35,120
I see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?

921
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,120
All right, you win.
I'll just have to get used to you.

922
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:46,080
I admit, I'm licked.
But it's only because I'm worried.

923
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,040
If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.

924
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,120
I could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. I've been watched so closely...

925
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:58,120
I know. Well, you can help now.
I've got a room full of reporters in there.

926
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,120
Now, I want you to make a statement.

927
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:05,080
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.

928
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,080
And that if she returns
I won't interfere with your marriage.

929
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,120
- All right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

930
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,080
Okay.

931
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,120
I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

932
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,040
So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.

933
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,120
Goodnight.

934
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,120
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

935
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,040
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.

936
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,120
What about the money?

937
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:41,040
I talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.

938
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,120
- I must think something up before morning.
- That's swell.

939
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Yeah? I'm glad you think so.
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

940
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:53,120
I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.

941
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:02,080
I thought you were in a hurry to get back.

942
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,080
Whoever heard of getting in
at 3.00 in the morning?

943
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:13,080
Everybody will be asleep.

944
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:20,080
Okay. Cottage no. 6.

945
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,120
There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did I tell you...

946
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:52,120
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

947
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:02,080
We're on the last lap.

948
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,120
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

949
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,080
Yeah.

950
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,120
You'll have a great story, won't you?

951
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:16,120
Yeah. Swell.

952
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,120
Thanks.

953
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,040
We certainly outsmarted your father.

954
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,040
I guess you ought to be happy.

955
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,080
Am I going to see you in New York?

956
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,120
Nope.

957
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,040
Why not?

958
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,040
I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

959
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,040
There's no harm in your coming to see us.

960
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:41,040
Not interested.

961
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,120
Won't I ever see you again?

962
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,120
What for? I've served my purpose!

963
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,120
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

964
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,040
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

965
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,080
Me?

966
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,080
Yes.

967
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:38,040
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?

968
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:43,040
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

969
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:48,120
Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?

970
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:54,080
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.

971
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,120
Where are you gonna find her?

972
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,080
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

973
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,080
They don't come that way anymore.

974
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,120
Have I ever thought about it?

975
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:13,120
I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

976
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,040
I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.

977
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,040
That's where I'd like to take her.

978
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,080
She'd have to be the sort of a girl...

979
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:36,080
...who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

980
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,040
Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.

981
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:51,120
You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.

982
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,080
That's the only place to live.

983
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,080
The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.

984
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,080
I've been thinking about it.

985
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.

986
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,120
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

987
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,120
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

988
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,120
You better go back to your bed.

989
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,080
I love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.

990
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:37,040
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter...

991
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,040
...I can't let you out of my life now.

992
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:46,040
I couldn't live without you.

993
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:01,080
You'd better go back to your bed.

994
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:12,120
I'm sorry.

995
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:51,080
Did you mean that? Would you really go?

996
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,080
All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

997
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,120
That bag's worth $25.

998
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,120
I got a bag. I got one for Christmas...

999
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,040
Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning...

1000
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,080
...and buy it back from you
with a $10 profit.

1001
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,120
- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat.

1002
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,080
- What?
- I ain't got a hat.

1003
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:49,080
Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.

1004
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:57,120
Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.

1005
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,040
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.

1006
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,040
Sure, boss.

1007
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,080
Hello, Agnes.

1008
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,120
- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.

1009
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,120
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe.

1010
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,120
Don't "Joe" me.

1011
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,040
All right, Joe. Listen.

1012
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,080
You know I've always liked you.

1013
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,120
Anytime I could help you,
ran across a good story...

1014
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:22,080
...I came running to you with it.
I got one now.

1015
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,120
The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.

1016
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,120
- It's yours.
- About the Andrews kid?

1017
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,120
I've got it all written up, ready to go.
All I want is a $1,000.

1018
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,080
A $1,000? Get out of here before...

1019
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,120
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.

1020
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,040
I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.
I'm in a jam.

1021
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,120
What's the $1,000 for?

1022
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,040
To tear down the walls of Jericho.

1023
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,080
...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?

1024
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,080
- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

1025
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,080
Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?

1026
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:52,040
- Lf it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1027
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:56,080
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.

1028
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,080
- You?
- Yes.

1029
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,120
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1030
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,040
For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.

1031
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,120
We know each other.
You ought to know when I'm serious.

1032
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,080
This is on the level.
I met her on a bus from Miami.

1033
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,040
I've been with her every minute.
I'm in love with her.

1034
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,120
You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.

1035
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,080
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.

1036
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,120
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know I'm gone.

1037
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,080
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1038
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,080
What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews...

1039
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,080
That's it.

1040
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,120
Let me see that a minute.

1041
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:39,080
Zeke!

1042
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,080
I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.

1043
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,080
Who?

1044
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,080
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.

1045
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,040
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia.

1046
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:53,040
Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1047
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:58,040
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.

1048
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,080
See that? They're gone.

1049
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,080
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?

1050
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,080
Ma! Here's the woman.

1051
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,080
- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?

1052
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,120
- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.

1053
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,080
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.

1054
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,120
You got any money?

1055
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,120
- No.
- Then you'll have to git!

1056
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:39,040
Yeah. You'll have to git.

1057
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,120
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1058
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,120
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.

1059
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,120
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1060
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:54,120
And listen, next time you better not come
back here. I run a respectable place.

1061
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,040
- Thanks, you saved my life.
- Okay. So long kid and good luck.

1062
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:06,040
Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.

1063
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,120
I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.

1064
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,040
Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1065
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,120
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.

1066
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,120
Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church...

1067
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,040
...with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.

1068
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,040
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.

1069
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:45,040
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?

1070
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,040
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1071
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:52,040
I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.

1072
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,120
He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.

1073
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,080
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.

1074
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:00,040
When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1075
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,040
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.

1076
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,120
Agnes, get me a doctor,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1077
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,120
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare.

1078
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,040
Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1079
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,040
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched.

1080
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,040
You want us?

1081
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,120
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.

1082
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,120
She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.

1083
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,120
She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!

1084
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,040
Play it up big! Major league!
"Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.

1085
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,040
Okay.

1086
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:50,120
Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.

1087
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:03,120
Can't you drive any faster?

1088
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,120
"Young people in love are never hungry"

1089
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:23,080
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.

1090
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:36,120
Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.

1091
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,120
All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.

1092
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,120
Come on, step back.

1093
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,120
How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?

1094
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:52,120
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1095
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,040
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

1096
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:09,080
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze"

1097
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,040
Get that thing out of the way!

1098
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,040
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.

1099
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:53,120
Hey, you darn fool!

1100
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:58,080
Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.

1101
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,120
Gordon's out back some place.

1102
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:12,120
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1103
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,120
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in.

1104
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,080
- What?
- He left this money.

1105
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,080
- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?

1106
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:26,080
- There he goes.
- Hey, Pete!

1107
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:30,120
Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1108
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,120
Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.

1109
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,120
- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
- No, great.

1110
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,120
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn...

1111
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:44,120
...and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.

1112
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:50,080
Yeah. Where am I?

1113
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:57,080
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1114
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:02,080
Thanks.

1115
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:24,040
Ellie?

1116
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,080
Hello, Dad.

1117
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,120
I knocked several times.

1118
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,120
I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.

1119
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:35,040
Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.

1120
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,040
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1121
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,040
Stunt?

1122
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:44,040
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1123
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,120
Yes, I heard.

1124
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:49,040
Personally, I think it's silly, too.

1125
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,040
You look lovely, child.

1126
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,120
Are you pleased with the gown?

1127
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,080
Ellie?

1128
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:02,080
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1129
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:10,120
What's the matter, child?

1130
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:12,040
What's wrong?

1131
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,040
Nothing.

1132
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,080
You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?

1133
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,120
No.

1134
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:22,040
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1135
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,040
Well, you gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1136
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,080
You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.

1137
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:33,080
I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.

1138
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,040
What's the matter, child?

1139
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:40,080
Aren't you happy?

1140
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,080
I thought so.

1141
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:47,040
I knew there was something on your mind.

1142
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:51,040
There, now.

1143
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,120
What's the matter?

1144
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,120
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1145
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,080
Have you?

1146
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:07,080
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1147
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,120
This must be serious.

1148
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,080
Where'd you meet him?

1149
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,120
On the road.

1150
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,120
Now don't tell me you've fallen in love
with a bus driver?

1151
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:23,120
Oh, no.

1152
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,040
Who is he?

1153
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,080
I don't know very much about him.

1154
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,080
Except that I love him.

1155
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,120
If it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to...

1156
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:39,080
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1157
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:39,120
Come now.

1158
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:43,080
Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.

1159
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:48,080
He says that I'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.

1160
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,040
Ridiculous.

1161
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,120
He doesn't think so much of you, either.

1162
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,120
Well, l...

1163
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,120
And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1164
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,120
He says you raised me stupidly.

1165
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,120
And now that's a fine man
to fall in love with.

1166
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,120
He's marvellous.

1167
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:10,040
What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?

1168
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,040
- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.

1169
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:17,120
It wouldn't do any good.
I practically threw myself at him.

1170
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:22,120
Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?

1171
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,040
No, I'll go through with it.

1172
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,080
But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.

1173
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,080
No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1174
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,120
I've done it all my life.

1175
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:37,040
I've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.

1176
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:42,040
I'm tired, father. I'm tired
of running around in circles.

1177
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:47,040
He's right, that's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.

1178
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,080
I've got to settle down.

1179
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:54,080
It doesn't matter how,
where, or with whom.

1180
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,120
You've changed, Ellie.

1181
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:02,120
I can't walk out on King now.
It would make us all look so ridiculous.

1182
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:07,080
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1183
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,080
I'll never see Peter again.

1184
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,120
Is that his name?

1185
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,080
Peter Warne.

1186
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:19,120
Peter Warne.

1187
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,080
Why, do you know him?

1188
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,040
Why, no.

1189
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,080
Father, you haven't heard from him,
have you?

1190
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:30,080
- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?

1191
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:44,120
I guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?

1192
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:48,040
- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.

1193
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,120
- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.

1194
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:56,080
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1195
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,120
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

1196
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:03,080
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1197
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,080
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1198
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:10,080
Fine, have him come in.

1199
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:18,080
I'll be going.

1200
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,080
If it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.

1201
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,080
How are you, Ellie?

1202
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,080
You happy?

1203
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,040
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?

1204
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,040
Here we are, let's drink.

1205
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,080
It's up to you now.
I want our life to be full of excitement.

1206
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,120
We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.

1207
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,120
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1208
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:51,120
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.

1209
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:11,120
Yeah. Who?

1210
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,080
Why can't I see you at your office?

1211
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:16,120
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1212
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:21,120
I thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1213
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:34,080
No. Why do I wanna...

1214
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:39,040
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

1215
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,080
I'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.

1216
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,120
I wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1217
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:49,120
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1218
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:50,080
Mr. Warne?

1219
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,080
Yeah.

1220
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,080
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1221
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:01,040
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything...

1222
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,040
...about you. About your helping her.

1223
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,120
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1224
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,120
Why did she think
I lugged her from Miami?

1225
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,040
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1226
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,080
She does? Isn't that sweet of her?
You don't, I suppose.

1227
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:19,120
Well, I don't know. I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1228
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,120
I presume you feel justified.

1229
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:26,120
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemised.

1230
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:32,080
"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.

1231
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,040
"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.

1232
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:40,040
"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.

1233
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:44,080
"All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline."

1234
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,040
And I sold some shorts and socks, too.
I'm throwing those in.

1235
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:51,040
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

1236
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,080
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000,
maybe more.

1237
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:58,080
Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?

1238
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,120
What 10,000?

1239
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,040
The reward.

1240
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,080
Who said anything about a reward?

1241
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,120
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.
I assumed...

1242
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:12,120
All I want is $39.60. If you give
me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.

1243
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,040
It gives me the jitters.

1244
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,120
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1245
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,120
The average man would go
after the reward.

1246
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:23,040
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1247
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,040
It's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.

1248
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,120
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like paying for the privilege.

1249
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,120
Were you taken for a buggy ride?

1250
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,040
Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do I get it?

1251
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:41,040
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

1252
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,120
Here you are.

1253
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:56,080
Thank you.

1254
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,120
Do you mind if I ask you a question,
frankly?

1255
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,080
Do you love my daughter?

1256
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:05,120
Any guy in love with your daughter
should be examined.

1257
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,080
Now that's an evasion.

1258
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:11,120
She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.

1259
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:15,040
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1260
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:18,080
If you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.

1261
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,080
Do you love her?

1262
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,120
A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.

1263
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,040
She's my idea of nothing.

1264
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,040
I asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?

1265
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:31,040
Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
I'm a little screwy myself!

1266
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:37,080
Here's to the merry-go-round.

1267
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:46,080
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1268
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,080
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1269
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:54,120
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1270
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,120
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1271
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:02,120
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

1272
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,120
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.

1273
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:10,040
Now just a minute, Ellie.

1274
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:15,040
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

1275
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:30,040
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.

1276
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:24,080
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.

1277
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,080
You're a sucker to go through with this.

1278
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,120
That guy, Warne, is okay.

1279
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:59,040
He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.

1280
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,080
It's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.

1281
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:07,080
You took him for a ride.

1282
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:16,040
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1283
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,120
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1284
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:24,120
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1285
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,080
And you can make an old man happy.

1286
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,080
And you won't do so bad for yourself.

1287
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:36,080
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1288
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,040
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

1289
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:51,120
...and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman...

1290
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:56,080
...in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully...

1291
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:01,080
...be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.

1292
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:08,120
King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?

1293
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,040
I will.

1294
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:15,040
Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1295
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:20,040
...so long as you both shall live?

1296
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:23,040
Ellen!

1297
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:28,040
Ellie!

1298
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,080
What happened?

1299
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:59,080
I haven't the slightest idea.

1300
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:14,080
Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.

1301
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,080
Don't want to see anybody.

1302
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:21,080
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1303
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:26,080
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.

1304
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:32,080
That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.

1305
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:36,040
That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.

1306
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:41,040
I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.

1307
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:45,080
Don't fall out of any windows!

1308
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,120
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1309
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:52,080
"What's holding up the annulment,
you slowpoke.

1310
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:56,120
"The walls of Jericho are toppling."

1311
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:01,120
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let them topple."

1312
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,080
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1313
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,120
If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.

1314
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:11,120
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1315
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:15,080
They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.

1316
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,120
What do you reckon that's for?

1317
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:19,080
Blamed if I know.
I just brought them a trumpet.

1318
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,080
A trumpet?

1319
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,120
A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.

1320
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,040
What in the world do they want
a trumpet for?

1321
