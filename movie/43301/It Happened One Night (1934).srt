00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:06,986
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

2
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,030
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.

3
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:11,366
- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,328
Why don't you jam it down her throat?

5
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,205
It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:19,085
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:20,837
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,675
I won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.

9
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,304
Come now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

10
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:30,600
Not this time, you won't!
I'm already married to him.

11
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:33,020
You'll never live
under the same roof with him.

12
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,021
I'll see to it.

13
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:36,900
Get it through your head,
King Westley and I are married!

14
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:40,572
Definitely, legally, actually married!
It's over, it's finished.

15
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,951
There's not a thing you can do about it.
I'm over 21 and so is he.

16
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,578
While you've been onboard...

17
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:48,624
...I've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.

18
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:52,045
Annulled. I'll have something to say
about that and so will King.

19
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,505
I expect him to.

20
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,636
The vittles. Come in.

21
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:00,222
I told you not to bring any food in here.

22
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:02,517
Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.

23
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:03,810
Put it down here.

24
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:15,034
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

25
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,786
Strategy, my dear.

26
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:19,623
Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away...

27
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,250
...from the Justice of the Peace?

28
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:23,461
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

29
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,255
I've won many arguments that way.

30
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:28,676
Besides not liking him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

31
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:31,931
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best flyers in the country.

32
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:34,601
He's no good.
You married him because I said not to.

33
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:36,854
You're always telling me what not to do.

34
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,981
Because you've always been a stubborn idiot.

35
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,276
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,447
Don't shout so. You may work up an appetite.

37
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,159
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

38
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:48,327
All right, scream.

39
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,873
Let me off this boat or I'll break
every piece of furniture in here!

40
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:53,542
Here, now.

41
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:56,671
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.

42
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:58,841
Just smell it. It's a poem.

43
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,076
Lower the boats! Catch her!

44
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:21,454
Come on, men!

45
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,170
She got away, sir.

46
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:29,255
Of course, she's too smart for you.

47
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:32,385
Send a wireless to the Lovington Detective Agency.

48
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:33,553
"Daughter escaped again.

49
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:36,182
"Watch roads, airports and train stations in Miami."

50
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:42,023
All aboard! Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

51
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:44,944
...New York, Philadelphia.

52
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:48,073
We're wasting our time. 
Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.

53
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,908
I told the old man it was bunk.

54
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:51,619
Ticket for New York, please.

55
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,045
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:02,299
Thank you.

57
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,976
What's going on here?
I'd like to use that phone.

58
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,939
Go away. This is history in the making.

59
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:16,610
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

60
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:19,030
Heel, boy.

61
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,115
I can't stand this any longer.

62
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:23,243
In a pig's eye, you will.

63
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:28,334
Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound...

64
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,045
...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.

65
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,424
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

66
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:38,388
I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell 
me you were gonna write it in Greek?

67
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:39,807
I'd start a new department.

68
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,227
That was free verse, you gas house palooka.

69
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:45,481
What was free about it?
It cost this paper a gob of dough.

70
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:47,359
And it's not going to cost us any more!

71
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:48,485
Gordon.

72
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,363
Did you know he reversed the charge?

73
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:52,281
What? Why you...

74
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:57,538
When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.

75
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:01,794
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.

76
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:04,631
What'd he say?

77
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,971
So, you're changing your tune?

78
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:13,684
You're late with your apologies.

79
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:17,523
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!

80
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,526
I hope this'll be a lesson to you.

81
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,405
Did we tell that baby?

82
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,495
- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete.

83
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,789
I guess he knows now,
how I feel about his job.

84
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,500
I bet he does, too.

85
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,251
Is my chariot ready?

86
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:36,464
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth, mighty King.

87
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,887
- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.

88
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:42,847
Make way for the king.

89
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,725
Long live the king.

90
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,904
Philadelphia, all aboard!

91
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,909
Step down Marty, King is back.

92
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:00,412
On the rack in the back.
It's your goodbye chariot.

93
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:05,336
Make hams of you and scram!

94
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:07,213
Two thousand miles is a long trip.

95
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,759
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

96
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,136
Pillow, sir?

97
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:25,028
Driver! If you'll be good enough to move 
those newspapers, I'll have a seat.

98
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,544
Hey, wait a minute!

99
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:41,424
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,679
The papers. What's the idea of throwing them out?

101
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:47,891
The papers? It's a long story, my friend.

102
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,478
I never did like the idea of sitting on newspapers.

103
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:54,274
I did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.

104
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:57,613
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

105
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:01,535
They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.

106
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:05,123
A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.

107
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:12,006
Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but I do.

108
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,510
I always wear it out in the open so...

109
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:17,264
...if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.

110
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,517
Oh, yeah?

111
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,606
Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

112
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,318
Our conversation could have been over long ago.

113
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,611
Oh, yeah?

114
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:31,365
If you keep that up, we won't get anywhere.

115
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:33,159
Oh, yeah?

116
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:36,914
You got me. Yeah!

117
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:49,722
Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.

118
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:52,643
I beg your pardon?

119
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:55,313
Now listen,
I put up a stiff fight for that seat.

120
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,359
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.

121
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:01,947
Driver, are these seats reserved?

122
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,576
- No. First come, first serve.
- Thank you.

123
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,165
These seats accommodate two 
people, don't they?

124
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:11,084
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

125
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,253
Thank you.

126
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,591
Move over.

127
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:20,513
This is a "maybe they do."

128
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:31,778
If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.

129
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,806
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.

130
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,252
Get some! Come on, everybody!

131
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:17,588
Hot dogs, folks!

132
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:24,347
Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.

133
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,807
Red hot coffee!

134
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,352
Right around there.

135
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,480
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!

136
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:33,609
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!

137
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:16,916
He got away.

138
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,296
I found myself in the middle of 
brush and no sign of the skunk.

139
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,757
I don't know what you're 
raving about, young man.

140
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:26,554
- Furthermore, I'm not interested.
- Well of all the...

141
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,392
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.

142
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:32,603
My heavens! It's gone!

143
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,272
I knew you'd catch on eventually.

144
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:39,320
- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

145
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:44,034
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.

146
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:46,246
You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.

147
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:47,455
No, I can't.

148
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:51,378
- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.

149
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,380
Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.

150
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:56,926
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.

151
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:59,638
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!

152
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,142
That's ridiculous.
The company will take care of it.

153
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:06,356
Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?

154
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,483
I want to be left alone.

155
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:14,241
Why, you ungrateful brat.

156
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,286
Board!

157
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:18,163
All aboard!

158
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,550
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.

159
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,678
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.

160
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:08,474
Just 30 minutes. 
That's all. No more.

161
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:09,934
Read all about it!

162
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,015
I'm so sorry.

163
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,684
Silly, isn't it?

164
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:44,605
Why, everybody's gone!

165
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:50,446
Thank you for that, very much.

166
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:55,286
- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
- Yes.

167
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:59,583
That was foolish of me.

168
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:03,087
Why didn't you shove me away?

169
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:07,385
I hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.

170
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,389
How about some breakfast?

171
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:15,479
No thank you. No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

172
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,818
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.

173
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,945
No, they'll wait for me.

174
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:28,538
Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes 
late. Be sure to wait for me.

175
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:29,831
Yeah?

176
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:31,626
Yes.

177
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,698
Where's the bus to New York?

178
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:57,451
It left about 20 minutes ago.

179
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,831
But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

180
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,585
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

181
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:09,216
Good morning. Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

182
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:13,680
Seems to me, I've already thanked you for that.

183
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,224
What time's the next bus?

184
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:16,809
8:00 tonight.

185
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:19,897
8:00? That's 12 hours.

186
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:21,608
Sorry, miss.

187
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,613
What's the matter?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

188
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,158
What are you so excited about?
You missed it, too.

189
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,951
Yeah, I missed it too.

190
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:34,041
Don't tell me you did it on my account.

191
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,671
I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is...

192
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,800
Now look here young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

193
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,511
I can take care of myself.

194
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:47,475
You're doing a pretty sloppy 
job of it. Here's your ticket.

195
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,353
My ticket?

196
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:51,480
I found it on the seat.

197
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:58,615
Thank you.
It must have fallen out of my purse.

198
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,746
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

199
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:07,877
- What are you talking about?
- I said you'd never get away with it.

200
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,590
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

201
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:14,427
You must have me confused
with someone else.

202
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,804
Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.

203
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:24,690
I've always been curious to know...

204
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:28,904
...what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.

205
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:33,494
Take my advice. Grab the next bus 
back to Miami. That guy's a phoney.

206
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,123
I didn't ask for your advice.

207
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:39,960
That's right. You didn't.

208
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:43,465
You're not going to notify my father,
are you?

209
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:44,883
What for?

210
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:47,970
You probably could get 
some money out of him.

211
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:49,431
I never thought of that.

212
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:53,186
If you promise not to do it,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

213
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,105
You won't gain a thing by giving me away

214
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,316
as long as I'm willing 
to make it worth your while.

215
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,778
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

216
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,781
It's terribly important to me.

217
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,616
I'd pay you now, only...

218
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:06,244
...all I had when I jumped off
the yacht was a wrist watch.

219
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,414
I had to pawn it to get these clothes.

220
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:11,460
I'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.

221
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,961
Never mind.

222
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:15,590
I had you pegged right from the jump.

223
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:20,889
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.

224
00:17:21,014 --> 00:17:25,102
You're in a jam and all you can think of 
is your money. It never fails, does it?

225
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:27,564
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

226
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:29,150
No, you wouldn't.

227
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,027
It never occurred to you to say...

228
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,947
..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

229
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:36,618
That'd bring you down off your high horse.

230
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,121
I'll tell you something to ease your mind.

231
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,790
You don't have to worry about me.

232
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,543
I'm not interested in your 
money or your problem.

233
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:47,758
You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.

234
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:55,309
You send telegrams here?

235
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:58,730
I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?

236
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:05,906
"To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

237
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,079
"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.

238
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:13,750
"I know where Ellen Andrews is."
No, do you really?

239
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,879
Go on. Send the telegram.

240
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:21,009
"How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of..."

241
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:23,304
Mush.

242
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,641
"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.

243
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:29,354
"What I said about never writing
another line for you still goes.

244
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,440
"Are you burning? Peter Warne."

245
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,359
That'll be $2.60.

246
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:35,570
- Send it collect.
- Collect?

247
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:36,947
Collect.

248
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:47,670
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...

249
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:52,050
...Washington, Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, New York...

250
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:24,134
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.

251
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:26,595
Gets tiresome. Especially for somebody like you.

252
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,431
You look like you've got class.

253
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:33,271
Yes sir, with a capital "K". I'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.

254
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:36,943
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.

255
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,903
Shapeley sure knows how to pick 'em.

256
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:42,324
Yes sir. Shapeley's the name
and that's the way I like 'em.

257
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,285
You made no mistake sitting next to me.

258
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,121
Just between us, the kind 
of mugs you meet on the bus...

259
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,540
...ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.

260
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,544
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

261
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:54,048
You can't be too particular, neither.

262
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:56,510
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?

263
00:19:56,593 --> 00:20:00,515
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

264
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:06,147
That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance."

265
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,651
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.

266
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:11,655
Looks like you're one up on me.

267
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:14,826
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

268
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:19,122
...that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.

269
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:20,750
That's what I always say.

270
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:22,627
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,800
When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.

272
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:31,097
Now you're just my type.

273
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,393
Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.

274
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:39,692
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me.
With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.

275
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:43,196
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

276
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:48,036
Looks like you're two up on me now.

277
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,329
Hey, you.

278
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,294
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

279
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,924
I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

280
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,509
- Your wife?
- Yes.

281
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,470
Come on.

282
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:05,850
Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, I was just...

283
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:09,564
Sure. Excuse me, miss.
I was just trying to make things pleasant.

284
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,191
Excuse me, I...

285
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:13,778
I didn't mean anything, Doc.

286
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,032
- No offence, Doc.
- No.

287
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:27,337
If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.

288
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:31,635
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.

289
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:40,104
What'd you do all day?

290
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:44,819
Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.

291
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,616
Your clothes are all wet.

292
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:52,787
Here.

293
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:55,749
You're as helpless as a baby.

294
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:56,960
Thank you.

295
00:21:57,043 --> 00:22:02,049
Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

296
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:03,593
Here, boy.

297
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,224
- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.

298
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,894
- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But...

299
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:13,606
- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.

300
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,777
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!

301
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,573
$1.60.

302
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:23,327
You had $4 last night.

303
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:26,206
How will you get to New York at this rate?

304
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:28,751
That's none of your business.

305
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:31,505
You're on a budget from now on.

306
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:35,051
- Just a minute. You can't...
- Shut up.

307
00:22:57,122 --> 00:22:59,834
- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.

308
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,254
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

309
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:04,716
If any passengers want a place to sleep...

310
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,176
...you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.


311
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,638
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

312
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,142
Dyke's Auto camp.

313
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,520
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

314
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,647
Are you talking to me?

315
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:19,359
Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.

316
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:38,217
Hey! Come on, we're all set.

317
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,279
Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.

318
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:05,003
Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?

319
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,074
Darn clever, these Armenians?

320
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:30,077
Yeah, it's a gift.

321
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:37,503
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.

322
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:41,843
Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.
I registered as Mr. And Mrs.

323
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,261
You did?

324
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:47,851
What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?

325
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,855
I kind of half expected you to thank me.

326
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:54,568
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

327
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:57,363
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?

328
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,294
You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.

329
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:13,384
Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?

330
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:17,514
Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.

331
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:21,312
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

332
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,689
You're just a headline to me.

333
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,608
A headline?

334
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,696
You're not a newspaper man, are you?

335
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:30,949
Chalk up one for your side.

336
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:35,288
Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?

337
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:39,168
All right, I'm here to help you.
What I want is your story.

338
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:44,383
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.

339
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:48,638
I need that story.
Between you and me, I've got to have it.

340
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:54,980
Isn't that just too cute.

341
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:59,028
There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?

342
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,409
You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. Including this.

343
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:07,621
This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.

344
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:12,044
These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...

345
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,216
...but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.

346
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:26,229
Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.

347
00:26:26,522 --> 00:26:29,025
It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.

348
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,069
But I'm going to follow you.

349
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:32,195
Yeah.

350
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:37,494
And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.

351
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:41,124
Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.

352
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,420
A simple story for simple people.

353
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:48,258
You behave yourself,
I'll see you get to King Westley.

354
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:51,471
If not,
I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.

355
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:55,685
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?

356
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:58,856
This one? All right.

357
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:25,348
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

358
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:27,059
This?

359
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:33,860
I like privacy when I retire.
Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.

360
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,571
Prying eyes annoy me.

361
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,954
Behold the walls of Jericho.

362
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:46,209
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.

363
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:47,795
But a lot safer.

364
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,674
You see, I have no trumpet.

365
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:54,220
Now to show you
my heart's in the right place...

366
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:56,891
...l'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.

367
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:01,229
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

368
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,317
You don't want to join the Israelites?

369
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,113
All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

370
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:12,536
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

371
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,496
No two men do it alike.

372
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:18,376
I once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

373
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:20,463
Now he made a picture.

374
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:24,092
Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.

375
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:28,015
I have a method all my own.

376
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:32,312
If you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.

377
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:36,984
Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.

378
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:39,446
There's where I'm different.

379
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:41,449
I go for the shoes next.

380
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:44,369
First the right. Then the left.

381
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:49,919
After that, it's every man for himself.

382
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:14,743
Still with me, brat?

383
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,832
Don't be a sucker.

384
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:23,880
A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.

385
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:26,215
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.

386
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:30,305
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

387
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,746
"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
The big bad wolf

388
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,247
"The big bad wolf

389
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:55,630
"She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la"

390
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:01,095
Would you mind please,
putting out the light?

391
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:02,722
No, not at all.

392
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,029
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

393
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:47,823
Excuse me.

394
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:16,194
By the way, what's your name?

395
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:18,947
What's that?

396
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:20,908
Who are you?

397
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,244
Who, me?

398
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:27,249
I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.

399
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:31,714
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

400
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:34,593
You've got a name, haven't you?

401
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:37,806
Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.

402
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:40,350
Peter Warne.

403
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,103
I don't like it.

404
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,318
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

405
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,490
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

406
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:54,535
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

407
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:18,067
- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?

408
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,071
It's from Charleston.
"Checking every northbound train.

409
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:23,698
"Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.

410
00:32:23,782 --> 00:32:26,619
"No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.

411
00:32:26,702 --> 00:32:28,622
"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."


412
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,042
It's just the same as all the others.

413
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:34,463
- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.

414
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:36,883
- What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.

415
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:39,135
- All right, step on it.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:40,930
I hope she's all right.

417
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:45,060
All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?

418
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:48,272
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.

419
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:14,099
Hello?

420
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:17,978
Hey, mister.

421
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,486
Hello.

422
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:25,780
What's the matter, you not up yet?

423
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:28,575
- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.

424
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:32,915
It's a toothbrush, thanks.

425
00:33:33,582 --> 00:33:36,169
My dress, you had it pressed.

426
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:38,881
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

427
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,258
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

428
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:44,137
I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then...

429
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:45,932
...l'll drag you out myself.

430
00:33:46,015 --> 00:33:49,269
- One, two, three, four, five...
- I really think you would!

431
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:52,148
I'm out! I'm out!

432
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,820
You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.

433
00:33:57,906 --> 00:33:59,199
Outside?

434
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,869
All the best homes have them outside.

435
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,001
I can't go out like this.

436
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:10,005
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

437
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,799
Here, use mine.

438
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,344
Thanks.

439
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,637
Make it snappy.

440
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,140
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.

441
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:21,228
- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

442
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:26,402
Where'd you say the showers were?

443
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:27,778
Here's a towel.

444
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,490
Thank you.

445
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,411
You're kind of little, aren't you?

446
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:35,872
Where's the shower?

447
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:38,626
Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.

448
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,586
I'll find it myself.

449
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:15,174
Are the showers in there?

450
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:17,051
They ain't out here.

451
00:35:17,468 --> 00:35:18,720
Thank you.

452
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:25,062
Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?

453
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:33,907
You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

454
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:46,924
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?

455
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:49,009
Say, I'm sorry about last night.

456
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:52,682
Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.

457
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:04,196
High time you got back.

458
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,866
I met some very interesting women
at the showers.

459
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:10,496
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

460
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:15,378
Come on. Sit down.

461
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:19,842
My, my. Scrambled eggs.

462
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,558
Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

463
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:27,143
Any complaints?

464
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,687
No. No complaints.

465
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,149
I'd have cream for your coffee,
but I'd be buying a whole pint.

466
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,152
You don't have to apologise to me.

467
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,531
You don't know how much
I appreciate all this.

468
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:39,535
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

469
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:41,120
Must be the spring.

470
00:36:41,203 --> 00:36:44,499
I thought maybe "believe you me"
told you some more snappy stories.

471
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:48,922
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.

472
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:52,135
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.

473
00:36:54,303 --> 00:36:55,931
- Donut?
- Thanks.

474
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,562
You think this whole business is silly?

475
00:37:00,645 --> 00:37:02,064
Running away and all.

476
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:03,859
No. Makes too good a story.

477
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:07,530
Yes, you do.
You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

478
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:10,284
Perhaps I am.
Although, I don't see how I can be.

479
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,703
Spoiled people are used to
having their way.

480
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:14,497
I never have. On the contrary.

481
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,711
I've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.

482
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:23,175
Can you believe, this is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man?

483
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,427
Yeah.

484
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,680
It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

485
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:28,640
You're doing all right.

486
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,892
Thanks.

487
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:37,777
Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.

488
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:40,281
One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.

489
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:45,663
It has its moments. It's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.

490
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:49,710
I did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

491
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,630
It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.

492
00:37:52,714 --> 00:37:55,759
It didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.

493
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:59,974
I was so mad, I ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car I saw.

494
00:38:00,182 --> 00:38:01,475
Guess who was in it?

495
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,893
Santa Claus?

496
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:04,271
Gandhi?

497
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:06,357
King Westley was in it.

498
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:09,570
- Is that how you met him?
- Yes.

499
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:12,824
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

500
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:16,036
By 6:00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.

501
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:20,959
Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?

502
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,546
Now don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.

503
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:26,008
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.

504
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:30,638
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.

505
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:33,475
You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.

506
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,148
It's all a matter of timing.
I'll write a book about it.

507
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,524
Thanks, professor.

508
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,362
Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.

509
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,658
I'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.

510
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,246
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

511
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:53,961
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.

512
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:56,381
How do I know you're detectives?

513
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:58,550
Show him your credentials, Mac.

514
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:02,264
Detectives.

515
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,436
That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?

516
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,273
Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.

517
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:10,858
Get yourself all mussed up.

518
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:13,737
Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.

519
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:17,491
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.

520
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:21,080
She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.

521
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:22,790
What are you talking about?

522
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:26,461
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

523
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,759
She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

524
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:35,265
Come in.

525
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:38,102
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?

526
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:42,232
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

527
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,861
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

528
00:39:44,944 --> 00:39:46,739
Who, me? You wanna see me?

529
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:48,198
What's your name?

530
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:51,746
- Are you addressing me?
- Yeah. What's your name?

531
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,875
Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.

532
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,752
What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?

533
00:39:57,836 --> 00:40:01,175
- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.

534
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:02,342
This isn't a public park.

535
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:04,220
I got news to take a sock at you.

536
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:06,389
- Take it easy.
- The men are detectives.

537
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,642
Even if they're the
whole police department...

538
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:10,979
...they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.

539
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:13,816
Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.

540
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:18,697
Is that so? How many times
have I told you not to butt in?

541
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,951
You don't have to lose your temper!

542
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:24,246
As usual. Every time I try to protect you.

543
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:27,417
At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.

544
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,795
He did not! I told you a million times.

545
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:32,632
He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.

546
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:34,342
He didn't. You were drunk.

547
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:36,220
Nuts! Just like your old man.

548
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:39,016
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

549
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,226
There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.

550
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,104
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!

551
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:46,275
- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?

552
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:50,196
Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.

553
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,450
We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.

554
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,494
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.

555
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:57,081
Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.

556
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,666
Quit bawling!

557
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,588
I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.

558
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,317
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.

559
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,112
- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.

560
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:23,115
We could start a two-people
stock company.

561
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:25,952
Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.

562
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:28,331
We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."

563
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:30,833
What about "Cinderella" or
a real hot love story?

564
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:32,085
No, too mushy.

565
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:33,962
I like mushy stuff.

566
00:41:34,714 --> 00:41:36,215
Quit bawling!

567
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:38,677
Bus leaves in five minutes!

568
00:41:38,802 --> 00:41:41,055
- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.

569
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,893
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.

570
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,277
I'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.

571
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,653
This is the last session...

572
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,656
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

573
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,201
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

574
00:41:57,535 --> 00:42:02,041
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?

575
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:06,630
"Have I got a story. Stop.
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.

576
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,800
"Hope you're the same."

577
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,055
- Collect?
- Yes.

578
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,850
- If you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.

579
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,269
And that gives me an idea for all of you.

580
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,606
I want action, Lovington, action.

581
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:22,610
- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.

582
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:25,489
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.

583
00:42:25,614 --> 00:42:28,284
- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.

584
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:29,702
Send in Clark and Brown.

585
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:32,247
- You sure she isn't with King Westley?
- No.

586
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:35,168
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.

587
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:37,838
He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.

588
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:41,051
I'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.

589
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:42,218
I don't think so.

590
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:44,388
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.

591
00:42:44,472 --> 00:42:46,767
Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of...

592
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,187
...$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.

593
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:52,191
Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.

594
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:54,985
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

595
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:58,449
Wire this to them.
I want the story to break right away.

596
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:00,618
Now we'll get some action!

597
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:38,000
Fine, that's fine.

598
00:43:39,127 --> 00:43:43,507
You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?

599
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:45,636
Yeah.

What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.

641
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:58,055
Something happened to her.

642
00:46:58,138 --> 00:46:59,807
Look how pale she is.

643
00:47:08,151 --> 00:47:10,238
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.

644
00:47:10,404 --> 00:47:12,657
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

645
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:17,288
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

646
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:21,168
What happened to your money?

647
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:25,716
Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.

648
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:28,929
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

649
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:32,684
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

650
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,354
...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.

651
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,906
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

652
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,912
The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.

653
00:47:48,246 --> 00:47:51,583
I shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.

654
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:54,796
Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.

655
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,840
No, but you might need it.

656
00:47:56,924 --> 00:47:57,841
Come on.

657
00:47:57,925 --> 00:47:59,009
I got millions.

658
00:47:59,093 --> 00:47:59,928
Here.

659
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:02,222
- Thanks.
- Come on, go back.

660
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:21,455
Better phone for some help.

661
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:24,584
Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.

662
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:25,878
Yeah?

663
00:48:26,128 --> 00:48:29,550
Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?

664
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,723
Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

665
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,143
Take that story there, for instance.

666
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:41,065
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

667
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,274
No.

668
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,528
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.

669
00:48:45,028 --> 00:48:45,862
Why?

670
00:48:45,946 --> 00:48:47,740
Because I don't believe in hogging.

671
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:51,120
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

672
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:52,956
That's what I always say.

673
00:48:56,085 --> 00:48:57,711
What's on your mind?

674
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:00,173
Five G's or I crab the works.

675
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:09,310
Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.

676
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,939
I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.

677
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:19,156
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man I need.

678
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,536
- You made no mistake, believe you me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

679
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,207
- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?

680
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:27,501
Huh?

681
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:30,004
A gat. A rod.

682
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,549
- Got any fireworks on you?
- No.

683
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:37,848
I got a couple of machine guns in my 
suitcase. I'll give you one of them.

684
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:41,060
May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.

685
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:44,606
If you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.

686
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,985
I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.

687
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,111
Killer?

688
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:50,948
Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.

689
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,576
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

690
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:57,456
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

691
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,293
$10,000? Chicken feed.

692
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,216
Now listen, we're holding that 
dame for a million smackers.

693
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:08,138
Say, I didn't know it was anything 
like this. You see, I've got...

694
00:50:08,513 --> 00:50:10,933
What's the matter? You getting yellow?

695
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:14,479
I'm a married man. I got a couple 
of kids. I can't afford to get...

696
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:16,983
Pipe down your mug before I...

697
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:20,320
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

698
00:50:20,404 --> 00:50:23,616
Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?

699
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,243
You know too much.

700
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:27,246
I won't say anything, honest I won't.

701
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:30,333
How do I know that? I got a notion to plug you.

702
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:34,672
- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

703
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:35,757
Yeah?

704
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,345
What's your name?

705
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,013
Oscar Shapeley.

706
00:50:41,222 --> 00:50:43,684
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

707
00:50:44,143 --> 00:50:45,812
Got a couple of kids?

708
00:50:46,062 --> 00:50:49,358
Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.

709
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:52,112
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

710
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:54,156
You wouldn't. You're not thinking of...

711
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,784
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure.

712
00:50:57,077 --> 00:50:59,663
- If you don't...
- I'll keep my trap shut. I will.

713
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:01,708
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

714
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,627
Bugs Dooley? No.

715
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:07,257
He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.

716
00:51:07,382 --> 00:51:08,925
Got a little too talkative.

717
00:51:09,008 --> 00:51:10,803
- You know what happened to his kid?
- No.

718
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:14,433
I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.

719
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:16,310
Gee! That's terrible.

720
00:51:16,894 --> 00:51:19,982
He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. I never talk.

721
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,527
I never say a word. Word of honour.

722
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:25,322
I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.

723
00:51:25,406 --> 00:51:27,741
Okay. Just remember that.

724
00:51:28,994 --> 00:51:29,995
Now beat it.

725
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:34,250
Sure, mister. Thanks.
I always knew you guys were...

726
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:37,212
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

727
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:39,549
Sure. Anything you say.

728
00:51:39,924 --> 00:51:42,970
- You ain't gonna shoot me in the back, are ya?
- If you don't beat it...

729
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:44,305
I'm going.

730
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,369
What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?

731
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,372
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

732
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:05,040
Why?

733
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:14,761
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.

734
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:19,059
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

735
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,147
Why did we have to leave the bus?

736
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:25,943
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

737
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:29,948
I've been doing a little thinking myself.

738
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:33,662
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

739
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:35,747
What's the matter, are you weakening?

740
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:40,713
No. I was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.

741
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,091
Did you give that child all your money?

742
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:45,844
I gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.

743
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:48,222
All the money I had was that ten spot.

744
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:51,226
So I've been thinking
you better wire your father.

745
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:55,816
No, sir. I started out for New York
and I'm going to get there...

746
00:52:55,899 --> 00:52:58,319
...if I have to starve all the way.

747
00:52:58,570 --> 00:52:59,487
Okay.

748
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:04,118
What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?

749
00:53:04,285 --> 00:53:05,745
Here, take these.

750
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:09,167
- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?

751
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,878
Get up on the log.

752
00:53:21,558 --> 00:53:23,519
I wish you'd stop being playful.

753
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:28,650
So sorry. You know, this is the first 
time in years I've ridden piggyback.

754
00:53:29,234 --> 00:53:30,611
This isn't piggyback.

755
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:32,865
- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.

756
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:37,412
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

757
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:39,457
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

758
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,544
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

759
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:47,049
My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.

760
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:49,970
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

761
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:52,932
I never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.

762
00:53:54,017 --> 00:53:55,686
You're prejudiced.

763
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:59,357
Show me a good piggy backer.
I'll show you a real human.

764
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:02,653
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.

765
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:06,283
Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

766
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:10,539
My father was a great piggy backer.

767
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,710
Here, hold this a minute.

768
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,966
Thank you.

769
00:54:24,015 --> 00:54:27,436
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

770
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:43,457
This looks like the best spot.

771
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:46,502
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

772
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:50,216
I don't know about you, but I'm going 
to give a good imitation of it.

773
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:51,426
Peter?

774
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:52,844
What?

775
00:54:53,471 --> 00:54:55,264
I'm awfully hungry.

776
00:54:55,514 --> 00:54:57,017
It's just your imagination.

777
00:54:57,142 --> 00:54:58,602
No it isn't.

778
00:54:58,935 --> 00:55:01,731
I'm hungry and scared.

779
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:04,735
You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.

780
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:06,195
Well, I am.

781
00:55:06,279 --> 00:55:08,656
If you're scared, it scares the hunger out of you.

782
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,118
Not if you're more hungry than scared.

783
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:14,247
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.

784
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:19,171
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

785
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:23,593
Holy smoke!
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

786
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,473
If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.

787
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:29,684
What about your story?

788
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:32,521
Taking a married woman back to her husband.

789
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:38,946
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

790
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,951
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.

791
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:46,248
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

792
00:55:46,332 --> 00:55:47,916
- Then take them off.
- What?

793
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,255
All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.

794
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,633
You're becoming awfully disagreeable lately.

795
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,304
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

796
00:56:32,266 --> 00:56:35,604
If being with me is so distasteful 
to you, you can leave.

797
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:39,777
You can leave any time you see fit.

798
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:43,031
Nobody's holding you here.

799
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:46,285
I can get along.

800
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,294
Peter?

801
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:57,174
Peter!

802
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:08,105
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

803
00:57:08,189 --> 00:57:11,985
What's got into you? I left for a minute
to find you something to eat.

804
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:13,237
I know but...

805
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:15,406
Here, eat your head off.

806
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:16,992
I don't want it now.

807
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:19,662
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but...

808
00:57:19,787 --> 00:57:21,080
But what?

809
00:57:21,164 --> 00:57:23,751
I was so scared, it scared the hunger...

810
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:27,214
Holy jumping catfish. You drive a guy crazy.

811
00:58:10,395 --> 00:58:12,523
It's liable to get chilly before morning.

812
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:14,317
Better use this.

813
00:58:50,615 --> 00:58:52,158
What are you thinking about?

814
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:56,790
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.

815
00:58:58,124 --> 00:59:00,127
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:04,841
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

817
00:59:39,178 --> 00:59:41,515
What did you say we're supposed to be doing?

818
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,850
Hitchhiking.

819
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:48,900
You've given me a very good 
example of the hiking.

820
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:51,319
Where does the hitching come in?

821
00:59:51,402 --> 00:59:53,906
It's a little early yet. No cars out.

822
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,245
If it's the same to you...

823
00:59:59,372 --> 01:00:02,584
...I'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.

824
01:00:13,431 --> 01:00:14,809
You got a toothpick?

825
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:17,646
- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.

826
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:21,317
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here, I got a penknife, though.

827
01:00:21,817 --> 01:00:22,903
Now hold still.

828
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,531
- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?

829
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:28,743
All right, now hold still.

830
01:00:30,162 --> 01:00:32,039
Here. Get it?

831
01:00:32,749 --> 01:00:34,000
Thanks.

832
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:38,047
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?

833
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,883
You needn't rub it in.

834
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:46,517
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

835
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:48,978
- Raw?
- Want one?

836
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:53,442
No. Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

837
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:57,698
That's right, I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

838
01:00:58,032 --> 01:01:01,161
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

839
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:03,873
Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

840
01:01:03,957 --> 01:01:06,042
I hate the horrid things.

841
01:01:08,254 --> 01:01:11,716
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.

842
01:01:11,841 --> 01:01:14,261
And suppose nobody stops for us?

843
01:01:14,428 --> 01:01:17,933
They'll stop all right. It's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.

844
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,685
And you're an expert I suppose.

845
01:01:19,811 --> 01:01:23,649
Expert. And I'll write a book
about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

846
01:01:23,732 --> 01:01:26,611
There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?

847
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:28,739
- You think it's simple?
- No.

848
01:01:28,948 --> 01:01:32,035
Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?

849
01:01:32,327 --> 01:01:35,373
Some people do it like this. Or like this.

850
01:01:36,874 --> 01:01:38,627
All wrong. Never get anywhere.

851
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:39,795
The poor things.

852
01:01:39,878 --> 01:01:43,633
But that old thumb never fails.
It's all a matter of how you do it, though.

853
01:01:43,759 --> 01:01:46,220
Now you take No. 1, for instance.

854
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:50,059
That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.

855
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:52,812
You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.

856
01:01:52,895 --> 01:01:56,150
- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.

857
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:58,569
Smile goes with this one, like this.

858
01:02:00,114 --> 01:02:03,326
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

859
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:07,039
You figured that out all by yourself?

860
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:10,836
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.

861
01:02:10,919 --> 01:02:13,589
When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.

862
01:02:13,673 --> 01:02:17,552
It's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.

863
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:20,181
That's amazing.

864
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,727
But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.

865
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:25,146
Here comes a car.

866
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,817
Okay. Now watch me.
I'm gonna use No. 1.

867
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,113
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.

868
01:02:36,536 --> 01:02:38,956
I still got my eye on the thumb.

869
01:02:39,206 --> 01:02:42,085
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try No. 2.

870
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:45,464
When you get to 100, wake me up.

871
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:28,062
I don't think I'll write that book after all.

872
01:03:28,396 --> 01:03:30,649
Think of all the fun you had, though.

873
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:34,237
You mind if I try?

874
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:36,073
You?

875
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:39,160
Don't make me laugh.

876
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:44,166
You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

877
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,629
I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.

878
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:49,757
What are you gonna do?

879
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:52,094
It's a system all my own.

880
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:15,416
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?

881
01:04:15,624 --> 01:04:16,960
What for?

882
01:04:18,336 --> 01:04:22,133
I proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.

883
01:04:22,717 --> 01:04:26,347
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

884
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:28,892
I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.

885
01:04:29,643 --> 01:04:33,273
So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.

886
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:38,697
But if I was young, that's the way
I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.

887
01:04:38,947 --> 01:04:43,244
Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway

888
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:47,333
"Of love on a honeymoon

889
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,337
"Hitchhiking down the highway, down"

890
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:04,605
Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

891
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,817
Tonsil? Me? No.

892
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:12,408
Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"

893
01:05:13,617 --> 01:05:16,079
All right, let it go.

894
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:17,539
"Turn"

895
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:28,429
How about a bite to eat?

896
01:05:28,554 --> 01:05:31,141
- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.

897
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:33,393
Young people in love are never hungry.

898
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:34,311
No.

899
01:05:34,395 --> 01:05:37,190
"Young people in love

900
01:05:37,274 --> 01:05:41,237
"Are very seldom hungry

901
01:05:41,612 --> 01:05:46,828
"People in love are very seldom hungry"

902
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:50,874
What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?

903
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:54,254
Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.

904
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:56,173
Eat a carrot.

905
01:05:56,924 --> 01:05:57,967
No.

906
01:05:59,177 --> 01:06:00,679
I'm going in to ask him.

907
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:02,849
You do and I'll break your neck.

908
01:06:14,906 --> 01:06:17,618
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

909
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:45,405
I'm sorry...

910
01:06:45,822 --> 01:06:47,407
That's all right.

911
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:01,426
Hey! Come here!

912
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,722
You've got my suitcase!

913
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,837
What happened to you? I was worried.

914
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,214
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

915
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,217
Well, what happened?

916
01:07:33,301 --> 01:07:36,972
A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.

917
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:38,474
How'd you get the car?

918
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:41,729
I gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.

919
01:08:13,604 --> 01:08:15,940
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

920
01:08:16,441 --> 01:08:18,526
Gotta start promoting some.

921
01:08:20,446 --> 01:08:23,366
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

922
01:08:24,117 --> 01:08:26,245
That'll be good for ten gallons.

923
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:04,879
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

924
01:09:04,962 --> 01:09:07,632
I don't like you. Never have. Never will.

925
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:09,635
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?

926
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:12,389
You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.

927
01:09:12,473 --> 01:09:14,308
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

928
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:16,936
Ellie and I got married
because we love each other.

929
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:20,901
She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.

930
01:09:20,984 --> 01:09:26,198
I see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?

931
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,789
All right, you win.
I'll just have to get used to you.

932
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:36,045
I admit, I'm licked.
But it's only because I'm worried.

933
01:09:36,963 --> 01:09:40,551
If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.

934
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:44,556
I could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. I've been watched so closely...

935
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:49,855
I know. Well, you can help now.
I've got a room full of reporters in there.

936
01:09:50,397 --> 01:09:52,525
Now, I want you to make a statement.

937
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:56,530
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.

938
01:09:56,614 --> 01:10:00,285
And that if she returns
I won't interfere with your marriage.

939
01:10:11,216 --> 01:10:13,678
- All right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

940
01:10:13,762 --> 01:10:14,888
Okay.

941
01:10:15,138 --> 01:10:17,808
I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

942
01:10:17,892 --> 01:10:20,395
So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.

943
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:21,855
Goodnight.

944
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,069
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

945
01:10:26,153 --> 01:10:28,906
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.

946
01:10:29,072 --> 01:10:30,366
What about the money?

947
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:33,704
I talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.

948
01:10:33,787 --> 01:10:36,541
- I must think something up before morning.
- That's swell.

949
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:41,422
Yeah? I'm glad you think so.
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

950
01:10:42,049 --> 01:10:46,679
I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.

951
01:10:50,726 --> 01:10:53,313
I thought you were in a hurry to get back.

952
01:10:58,361 --> 01:11:01,866
Whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?

953
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,620
Everybody will be asleep.

954
01:11:10,127 --> 01:11:12,923
Okay. Cottage no. 6.

955
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,378
There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did I tell you...

956
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:46,926
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

957
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,102
We're on the last lap.

958
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:02,488
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

959
01:12:02,571 --> 01:12:03,781
Yeah.

960
01:12:06,117 --> 01:12:07,911
You'll have a great story, won't you?

961
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:10,873
Yeah. Swell.

962
01:12:33,361 --> 01:12:34,613
Thanks.

963
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,120
We certainly outsmarted your father.

964
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,708
I guess you ought to be happy.

965
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:18,754
Am I going to see you in New York?

966
01:13:21,174 --> 01:13:22,342
Nope.

967
01:13:24,637 --> 01:13:25,930
Why not?

968
01:13:27,307 --> 01:13:30,645
I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

969
01:13:32,396 --> 01:13:34,942
There's no harm in your coming to see us.

970
01:13:36,486 --> 01:13:37,946
Not interested.

971
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:43,620
Won't I ever see you again?

972
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:46,666
What for? I've served my purpose!

973
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:50,504
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

974
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:28,971
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

975
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,725
Me?

976
01:14:33,227 --> 01:14:34,144
Yes.

977
01:14:36,147 --> 01:14:38,692
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?

978
01:14:41,363 --> 01:14:45,034
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

979
01:14:47,078 --> 01:14:49,998
Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?

980
01:14:54,004 --> 01:14:56,591
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.

981
01:14:58,259 --> 01:14:59,762
Where are you gonna find her?

982
01:14:59,845 --> 01:15:02,264
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

983
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,518
They don't come that way anymore.

984
01:15:09,441 --> 01:15:11,443
Have I ever thought about it?

985
01:15:13,113 --> 01:15:16,242
I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

986
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:26,713
I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.

987
01:15:30,301 --> 01:15:31,971
That's where I'd like to take her.

988
01:15:34,265 --> 01:15:36,643
She'd have to be the sort of a girl...

989
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:40,440
...who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

990
01:15:46,532 --> 01:15:51,496
Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.

991
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,877
You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.

992
01:15:58,296 --> 01:16:00,800
That's the only place to live.

993
01:16:01,927 --> 01:16:06,766
The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.

994
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:14,652
I've been thinking about it.

995
01:16:16,278 --> 01:16:19,825
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.

996
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:30,297
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

997
01:16:30,381 --> 01:16:33,134
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

998
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:36,681
You better go back to your bed.

999
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,019
I love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.

1000
01:16:41,103 --> 01:16:44,857
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter...

1001
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:48,237
...I can't let you out of my life now.

1002
01:16:49,364 --> 01:16:51,909
I couldn't live without you.

1003
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:07,763
You'd better go back to your bed.

1004
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,568
I'm sorry.

1005
01:17:57,453 --> 01:18:00,165
Did you mean that? Would you really go?

1006
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,346
All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

1007
01:18:43,472 --> 01:18:45,015
That bag's worth $25.

1008
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:47,936
I got a bag. I got one for Christmas...

1009
01:18:48,019 --> 01:18:50,606
Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning...

1010
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:52,860
...and buy it back from you with a $10 profit.

1011
01:18:52,943 --> 01:18:55,237
- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat.

1012
01:18:55,571 --> 01:18:57,532
- What?
- I ain't got a hat.

1013
01:18:58,074 --> 01:19:00,744
Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.

1014
01:19:08,212 --> 01:19:11,801
Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.

1015
01:19:11,884 --> 01:19:15,681
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.

1016

01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:16,974
Sure, boss.



1017
01:19:19,728 --> 01:19:20,855
Hello, Agnes.

1018
01:19:20,938 --> 01:19:24,359
- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.

1019
01:19:24,443 --> 01:19:27,363
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe.

1020
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:28,447
Don't "Joe" me.

1021
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:29,991
All right, Joe. Listen.

1022
01:19:30,075 --> 01:19:31,535
You know I've always liked you.


1023
01:19:31,618 --> 01:19:34,163
Anytime I could help you,
ran across a good story...

1024
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:37,251
...I came running to you with it.
I got one now.

1025
01:19:37,501 --> 01:19:39,921
The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.

1026
01:19:40,005 --> 01:19:41,756
- It's yours.
- About the Andrews kid?

1027
01:19:41,881 --> 01:19:45,303
I've got it all written up, ready to go.
All I want is a $1,000.

1028
01:19:45,428 --> 01:19:47,097
A $1,000? Get out of here before...

1029
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,267
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.

1030
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,895
I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.
I'm in a jam.

1031
01:19:51,979 --> 01:19:53,647
What's the $1,000 for?

1032
01:19:53,731 --> 01:19:55,358
To tear down the walls of Jericho.

1033
01:19:55,442 --> 01:19:57,235
Never mind. If I told you that...

1034
01:19:57,318 --> 01:19:59,405
...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?

1035
01:19:59,488 --> 01:20:01,491
- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

1036
01:20:01,575 --> 01:20:03,493
Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?

1037
01:20:03,577 --> 01:20:06,414
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1038
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:11,754
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.

1039
01:20:13,339 --> 01:20:15,092
- You?
- Yes.

1040
01:20:15,175 --> 01:20:18,430
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1041
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:21,058
For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.

1042
01:20:21,142 --> 01:20:23,854
We know each other.
You ought to know when I'm serious.

1043
01:20:23,937 --> 01:20:26,649
This is on the level.
I met her on a bus from Miami.

1044
01:20:26,733 --> 01:20:29,361
I've been with her every minute.
I'm in love with her.

1045
01:20:29,445 --> 01:20:32,072
You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.

1046
01:20:32,156 --> 01:20:34,284
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.

1047
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:37,413
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know I'm gone.

1048
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:40,917
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1049
01:20:41,126 --> 01:20:45,382
What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews...

1050
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:46,967
That's it.

1051
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:50,597
Let me see that a minute.

1052
01:20:53,267 --> 01:20:54,394
Zeke!

1053
01:20:57,982 --> 01:21:00,986
I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.

1054
01:21:01,153 --> 01:21:02,029
Who?

1055
01:21:02,195 --> 01:21:05,950
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.

1056
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:09,329
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia.

1057
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:12,208
Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1058
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:15,546
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.

1059
01:21:29,648 --> 01:21:31,233
See that? They're gone.

1060
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:34,530
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?

1061
01:21:35,698 --> 01:21:38,118
Ma! Here's the woman.

1062
01:21:38,618 --> 01:21:40,997
- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?

1063
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:44,168
- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.

1064
01:21:46,128 --> 01:21:49,299
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.

1065
01:21:51,343 --> 01:21:53,096
You got any money?

1066
01:21:53,722 --> 01:21:55,432
- No.
- Then you'll have to git!

1067
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:57,310
Yeah. You'll have to git.

1068
01:22:00,314 --> 01:22:02,984
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1069
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:05,153
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.

1070
01:22:05,236 --> 01:22:09,617
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1071
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:15,876
And listen, next time you better not come
back here. I run a respectable place.

1072
01:22:19,881 --> 01:22:23,051
- Thanks, you saved my life.
- Okay. So long kid and good luck.

1073
01:22:23,135 --> 01:22:27,223
Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.

1074
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,854
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaper man in the business.

1075
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,608
Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.

1076
01:22:34,233 --> 01:22:35,526
Hold up the morning edition.

1077
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:38,280
Break down the front page.
We'll have a new layout.

1078
01:22:38,363 --> 01:22:42,160
Send in a couple of rewrite men.
And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.

1079
01:22:42,243 --> 01:22:46,499
I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.

1080
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:51,005
Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1081
01:22:51,088 --> 01:22:55,678
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.

1082
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,432
Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church...

1083
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:01,478
...with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.

1084
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:03,771
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.

1085
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:07,568
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?

1086
01:23:10,113 --> 01:23:12,283
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1087
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:16,163
I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.

1088
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:19,292
He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.

1089
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:21,837
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.

1090
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,924
When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1091
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:28,763
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.

1092
01:23:28,929 --> 01:23:31,975
Agnes, get me a doctor,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1093
01:23:32,058 --> 01:23:34,562
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare.

1094
01:23:34,645 --> 01:23:38,317
Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1095
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,196
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched.

1096
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:42,114
You want us?

1097
01:23:42,198 --> 01:23:45,368
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.

1098
01:23:45,452 --> 01:23:48,414
She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.

1099
01:23:48,497 --> 01:23:51,083
She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!

1100
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:54,964
Play it up big! Major league!
"Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.

1101
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:56,132
Okay.

1102
01:24:12,487 --> 01:24:15,240
Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.

1103
01:24:26,088 --> 01:24:28,382
Can't you drive any faster?

1104
01:24:31,303 --> 01:24:37,353
"Young people in love are never hungry"

1105
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:49,619
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.

1106
01:25:00,383 --> 01:25:03,721
Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.

1107
01:25:07,643 --> 01:25:10,772
All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.

1108
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:12,649
Come on, step back.

1109
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:16,946
How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?

1110
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:20,034
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1111
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:34,178
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

1112
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:38,642
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze"

1113
01:25:52,326 --> 01:25:53,995
Get that thing out of the way!

1114
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:58,000
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.

1115
01:26:20,572 --> 01:26:22,366
Hey, you darn fool!

1116
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:31,999
Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.

1117
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,888
Gordon's out back some place.

1118
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:46,810
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1119
01:27:50,397 --> 01:27:53,318
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in.

1120
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:54,820
- What?
- He left this money.

1121
01:27:54,904 --> 01:27:57,199
- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?

1122
01:27:57,282 --> 01:27:59,284
- There he goes.
- Hey, Pete!

1123
01:28:02,497 --> 01:28:07,295
Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1124
01:28:07,379 --> 01:28:10,257
Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.

1125
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:13,303
- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
- No, great.

1126
01:28:13,387 --> 01:28:16,682
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn...

1127
01:28:16,766 --> 01:28:21,563
...and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.

1128
01:28:22,357 --> 01:28:24,985
Yeah. Where am I?

1129
01:28:30,534 --> 01:28:33,454
When you sober up, come in and talk to me.

1130
01:28:34,665 --> 01:28:35,707
Thanks.

1131
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,201
Ellie?

1132
01:29:02,743 --> 01:29:04,078
Hello, Dad.

1133
01:29:04,161 --> 01:29:05,830
I knocked several times.

1134
01:29:06,831 --> 01:29:09,502
I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.

1135
01:29:09,585 --> 01:29:13,674
Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.

1136
01:29:14,299 --> 01:29:16,469
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1137
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,055
Stunt?

1138
01:29:18,138 --> 01:29:20,349
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1139
01:29:23,896 --> 01:29:25,272
Yes, I heard.

1140
01:29:25,356 --> 01:29:27,359
Personally, I think it's silly, too.

1141
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,488
You look lovely, child.

1142
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:32,573
Are you pleased with the gown?

1143
01:29:33,867 --> 01:29:34,868
Ellie?

1144
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,209
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1145
01:29:46,425 --> 01:29:48,135
What's the matter, child?

1146
01:29:51,265 --> 01:29:52,600
What's wrong?

1147
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:53,893
Nothing.

1148
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,147
You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?

1149
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:58,358
No.

1150
01:29:58,566 --> 01:30:02,905
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1151
01:30:03,072 --> 01:30:06,368
Well, you gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1152
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:09,372
You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.

1153
01:30:09,914 --> 01:30:14,462
I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.

1154
01:30:14,629 --> 01:30:16,381
What's the matter, child?

1155
01:30:17,675 --> 01:30:19,093
Aren't you happy?

1156
01:30:22,264 --> 01:30:24,016
I thought so.

1157
01:30:24,517 --> 01:30:27,312
I knew there was something on your mind.

1158
01:30:29,315 --> 01:30:31,109
There, now.

1159
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,905
What's the matter?

1160
01:30:36,574 --> 01:30:39,745
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1161
01:30:41,665 --> 01:30:42,999
Have you?

1162
01:30:46,546 --> 01:30:49,424
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby.

1163
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:52,720
This must be serious.

1164
01:30:54,056 --> 01:30:55,683
Where'd you meet him?

1165
01:30:57,727 --> 01:30:59,187
On the road.

1166
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:02,358
Now don't tell me you've fallen 
in love with a bus driver?

1167
01:31:02,483 --> 01:31:03,777
Oh, no.

1168
01:31:08,491 --> 01:31:09,702
Who is he?

1169
01:31:11,078 --> 01:31:13,331
I don't know very much about him.

1170
01:31:14,249 --> 01:31:16,210
Except that I love him.

1171
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:19,714
If it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to...

1172
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:23,219
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1173
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:24,554
Come now.

1174
01:31:24,637 --> 01:31:27,724
Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.

1175
01:31:27,891 --> 01:31:33,899
He says that I'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.

1176
01:31:34,275 --> 01:31:35,694
Ridiculous.

1177
01:31:36,152 --> 01:31:38,656
He doesn't think so much of you, either.

1178
01:31:38,781 --> 01:31:39,782
Well, l...

1179
01:31:39,865 --> 01:31:42,786
And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1180
01:31:43,036 --> 01:31:45,623
He says you raised me stupidly.

1181
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:49,044
And now that's a fine man to fall in love with.

1182
01:31:49,586 --> 01:31:51,256
He's marvellous.

1183
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,677
What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?

1184
01:31:55,803 --> 01:31:58,723
- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.

1185
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:03,021
It wouldn't do any good.
I practically threw myself at him.

1186
01:32:03,772 --> 01:32:07,652
Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?

1187
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:10,614
No, I'll go through with it.

1188
01:32:10,698 --> 01:32:13,660
But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.

1189
01:32:13,827 --> 01:32:16,998
No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1190
01:32:17,123 --> 01:32:19,376
I've done it all my life.

1191
01:32:19,459 --> 01:32:22,964
I've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.

1192
01:32:23,923 --> 01:32:29,139
I'm tired, father. I'm tired
of running around in circles.

1193
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:33,645
He's right, that's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.

1194
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:36,231
I've got to settle down.

1195
01:32:37,233 --> 01:32:40,320
It doesn't matter how, where, or with whom.

1196
01:32:41,947 --> 01:32:44,701
You've changed, Ellie.

1197
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:50,041
I can't walk out on King now.
It would make us all look so ridiculous.

1198
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:54,255
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1199
01:32:55,382 --> 01:32:57,426
I'll never see Peter again.

1200
01:32:57,676 --> 01:32:59,387
Is that his name?

1201
01:33:01,264 --> 01:33:02,725
Peter Warne.

1202
01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:05,645
Peter Warne.

1203
01:33:08,524 --> 01:33:09,984
Why, do you know him?

1204
01:33:10,109 --> 01:33:11,736
Why, no.

1205
01:33:12,028 --> 01:33:14,615
Father, you haven't heard from him, have you?

1206
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:17,870
- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?

1207
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,683
I guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?

1208
01:33:34,808 --> 01:33:37,895
- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.

1209
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,983
- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.

1210
01:33:42,152 --> 01:33:46,115
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1211
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:50,745
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

1212
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:53,791
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1213
01:33:53,916 --> 01:33:56,044
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1214
01:33:56,169 --> 01:33:57,922
Fine, have him come in.

1215
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:06,224
I'll be going.

1216
01:34:17,531 --> 01:34:20,910
If it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.

1217
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:22,413
How are you, Ellie?

1218
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:24,165
You happy?

1219
01:34:24,248 --> 01:34:26,793
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?

1220
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:29,255
Here we are, let's drink.

1221
01:34:29,338 --> 01:34:32,676
It's up to you now.
I want our life to be full of excitement.

1222
01:34:32,759 --> 01:34:36,055
We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.

1223
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:38,684
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1224
01:34:39,268 --> 01:34:43,565
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.

1225
01:35:00,087 --> 01:35:02,381
Yeah. Who?

1226
01:35:05,093 --> 01:35:06,679
Why can't I see you at your office?

1227
01:35:06,971 --> 01:35:10,392
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1228
01:35:10,475 --> 01:35:13,646
I thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1229
01:35:13,813 --> 01:35:17,318
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1230
01:35:17,401 --> 01:35:20,071
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1231
01:35:20,155 --> 01:35:23,451
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1232
01:35:23,576 --> 01:35:26,079
No. Why do I wanna...

1233
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:33,589
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

1234
01:35:33,965 --> 01:35:37,094
I'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.

1235
01:35:37,178 --> 01:35:39,805
I wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1236
01:35:39,889 --> 01:35:42,142
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1237
01:35:45,062 --> 01:35:45,771
Mr. Warne?

1238
01:35:45,855 --> 01:35:47,024
Yeah.

1239
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:52,155
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1240
01:35:52,531 --> 01:35:56,453
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything...

1241
01:35:56,536 --> 01:35:58,538
...about you. About your helping her.

1242
01:35:58,621 --> 01:36:01,751
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1243
01:36:01,877 --> 01:36:04,379
Why did she think I lugged her all the 
way from Miami, for the love of it?

1244
01:36:04,588 --> 01:36:07,258
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1245
01:36:07,341 --> 01:36:11,598
Oh, she does, eh? Now, isn't that 
sweet of her? You don't, I suppose.

1246
01:36:11,723 --> 01:36:16,187
Well, I don't know. I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1247
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,148
I presume you feel justified.

1248
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:21,694
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemised.

1249
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:29,370
"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.

1250
01:36:29,454 --> 01:36:32,207
"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.00.

1251
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:38,132
"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.

1252
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:41,720
"All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline."

1253
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:44,891
And I sold some shorts and socks, too.
I'm throwing those in.

1254
01:36:45,016 --> 01:36:48,312
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

1255
01:36:48,605 --> 01:36:51,232
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000, maybe more.

1256
01:36:51,316 --> 01:36:56,531
Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?

1257
01:36:56,948 --> 01:36:58,534
What $10,000?

1258
01:36:58,993 --> 01:37:00,411
The reward.

1259
01:37:01,163 --> 01:37:03,582
Who said anything about a reward?

1260
01:37:03,749 --> 01:37:06,502
I'm afraid I'm a little 
bit confused. I assumed...

1261
01:37:06,586 --> 01:37:11,092
All I want is $39.60. If you give
me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.

1262
01:37:11,259 --> 01:37:12,969
It gives me the jitters.

1263
01:37:13,804 --> 01:37:16,975
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1264
01:37:17,058 --> 01:37:19,812
The average man would go after the reward. 
All You seem to be...

1265
01:37:19,896 --> 01:37:22,273
Did anybody ever make a sucker out of you?

1266
01:37:22,356 --> 01:37:25,402
It's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.

1267
01:37:25,486 --> 01:37:29,366
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like paying for the privilege.

1268
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:31,368
Were you taken for a buggy ride?

1269
01:37:31,535 --> 01:37:35,374
Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do I get it?

1270
01:37:36,042 --> 01:37:37,918
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

1271
01:37:52,438 --> 01:37:53,940
Here you are.

1272
01:37:54,274 --> 01:37:55,484
Thank you.

1273
01:37:56,818 --> 01:37:59,906
Do you mind if I ask you a question, frankly?

1274
01:38:00,282 --> 01:38:02,242
Do you love my daughter?

1275
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:06,624
Any guy in love with your 
daughter should be examined.

1276
01:38:06,707 --> 01:38:08,083
Now that's an evasion.

1277
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:12,380
She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.

1278
01:38:12,715 --> 01:38:16,595
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1279
01:38:16,678 --> 01:38:19,724
If you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.

1280
01:38:19,807 --> 01:38:21,017
Do you love her?

1281
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:24,188
A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.

1282
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:25,648
She's my idea of nothing.

1283
01:38:25,732 --> 01:38:28,069
I asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?

1284
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:32,324
Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
I'm a little screwy myself!

1285
01:38:34,577 --> 01:38:37,456
Here's to the merry-go-round.

1286
01:38:43,797 --> 01:38:46,383
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1287
01:38:51,849 --> 01:38:54,561
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1288
01:38:54,686 --> 01:38:57,190
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1289
01:38:57,857 --> 01:39:00,861
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1290
01:39:00,944 --> 01:39:03,323
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

1291
01:39:09,706 --> 01:39:12,502
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.

1292
01:39:12,585 --> 01:39:13,920
Now just a minute, Ellie.

1293
01:39:14,003 --> 01:39:16,632
I don't want to hear another word about him.

1294
01:39:29,398 --> 01:39:32,152
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.

1295
01:40:26,224 --> 01:40:28,518
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.

1296
01:40:57,181 --> 01:40:59,391
You're a sucker to go through with this.

1297
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:02,896
That guy, Warne, is okay.

1298
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:07,527
He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.

1299
01:41:07,611 --> 01:41:11,074
It's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.

1300
01:41:11,157 --> 01:41:13,118
You took him for a ride.

1301
01:41:20,378 --> 01:41:23,382
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1302
01:41:25,927 --> 01:41:28,931
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1303
01:41:29,264 --> 01:41:31,643
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1304
01:41:35,564 --> 01:41:37,984
And you can make an old man happy.

1305
01:41:38,068 --> 01:41:40,738
And you won't do so bad for yourself.

1306
01:41:41,155 --> 01:41:44,284
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1307
01:41:55,548 --> 01:41:58,886
Dearly beloved, we are gathered 
together here in the sight of God...

1308
01:41:58,969 --> 01:42:02,767
...and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman...

1309
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:07,272
...in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully...



1310
01:42:07,356 --> 01:42:12,571

...be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.

1311
01:42:15,367 --> 01:42:20,248
King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?

1312
01:42:20,748 --> 01:42:21,750
I will.

1313
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,547
Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1314
01:42:26,631 --> 01:42:28,926
...so long as you both shall live?

1315
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:33,683
Ellen!

1316
01:42:35,226 --> 01:42:36,435
Ellie!

1317
01:43:06,642 --> 01:43:07,769
What happened?

1318
01:43:07,894 --> 01:43:09,979
I haven't the slightest idea.

1319
01:43:24,749 --> 01:43:28,879
Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.

1320
01:43:28,963 --> 01:43:30,549
Don't want to see anybody.

1321
01:43:30,632 --> 01:43:32,467
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1322
01:43:35,889 --> 01:43:42,147
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.

1323
01:43:42,648 --> 01:43:47,237
That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.

1324
01:43:47,612 --> 01:43:51,242
That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.

1325
01:43:51,493 --> 01:43:55,832
I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.

1326
01:43:56,958 --> 01:43:59,294
Don't fall out of any windows!

1327
01:44:00,713 --> 01:44:03,926
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1328
01:44:04,468 --> 01:44:08,098
"What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke.

1329
01:44:08,431 --> 01:44:11,560
"The walls of Jericho are toppling."

1330
01:44:13,146 --> 01:44:17,777
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let them topple."

1331
01:44:20,906 --> 01:44:22,951
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1332
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:25,412
If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.

1333
01:44:25,496 --> 01:44:27,998
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1334
01:44:28,499 --> 01:44:32,130
They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.

1335
01:44:32,255 --> 01:44:33,631
What do you reckon that's for?

1336
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,301
Blamed if I know.
I just brung 'em a trumpet.

1337
01:44:36,385 --> 01:44:37,469
A trumpet?

1338
01:44:37,553 --> 01:44:40,014
Yeah one of them toy things. 
They sent me to the store to get it.

1339
01:44:40,098 --> 01:44:42,476
What in the world do they want a trumpet for?

1340
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,727
Don't know.
