1
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,326
Hunger strike, eh?
How long has this been going on?

2
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,620
She hasn't had a thing
yesterday or today.

3
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,497
- Send her meals up regularly?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,791
Why don't you jam it
down her throat?

5
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,127
It's not as simple as that,
Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,714
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,507
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,969
I'm not going to eat
until you let me off this boat!

9
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,680
Come, now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

10
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,225
Not this time, you won't.
I'm already married to him.

11
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,353
You're never going live
under the same roof. I'll see to that.

12
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,857
Can't you get it through your head
King Westley and I are married?

13
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,859
Definitely, legally,
actually married.

14
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,320
It's over.
There's not a thing you can do.

15
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,988
I'm over 21.
So is he.

16
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,741
Would it interest you to know
while you've been on board...

17
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,202
I've been making arrangements
to have your marriage annulled?

18
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,455
"Annulled!" I'll have something
to say about that, and so will King.

19
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,373
I expect him to.

20
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,044
Ah, the vittles.
Come in, come in.

21
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,463
I told you not to bring
any food in.

22
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,050
Wait a minute. This isn't for you.
Put it right down here.

23
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,394
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

24
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,813
Strategy, my dear.

25
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,025
I suppose it was strategy
sending gorillas to drag me
from that justice of the peace.

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,194
Your idea of strategy
is a lead pipe.

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,238
I've won a lot of arguments
with a lead pipe.

28
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:39,200
Outside the fact you don't like him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

29
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,286
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best fliers in the country.

30
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,914
You married him
only because I told you not to.

31
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,667
You've been telling me what not to do
since I can remember.

32
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,754
- Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.
- I come from a long line of stubborn idiots!

33
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,590
Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.

34
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,635
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

35
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,096
- All right, scream.
- If you don't let me off...

36
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,598
I'll break every piece
of furniture in this room!

37
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,726
Here, now. Have a nice piece
of juicy steak.

38
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,145
You don't have to eat it.
Just smell it.

39
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,939
It's a poem.

40
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,405
Oh!

41
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,615
Ellie! Ellie!

42
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,160
Ellie!

43
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,787
Ellen!

44
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,790
- Lower the boats!
- Lower the boats!

45
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,750
Catch her!
Catch her!

46
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,919
Come on, men.
Come on!

47
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,510
- She got away.
- Of course. She's too smart for you.

48
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,513
Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.

49
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,849
"Daughter escaped again.
Watch all roads...

50
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,184
airports, and railway stations
in Miami."

51
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,061
All aboard!

52
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,690
Palm Beach,
Savannah, Jacksonville...

53
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,942
New York, Philadelphia...

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,945
We're wasting our time.
You imagine Ellie Andrews riding a bus?

55
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,114
I told the old man
it was bunk.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,824
Ticket for New York, please.

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,081
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

58
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,920
- Here.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

59
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,134
What's going on?
I'd like to use that phone.

60
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,346
Shh! Go away.
This is history in the making.

61
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,432
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

62
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,893
Attaboy, Petey, old boy!

63
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,312
I can't stand this any longer.

64
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,523
- In a pig's eye, you will!
- That's telling him!

65
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,026
Listen, monkey face,
when you fired me...

66
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,197
- you fired the best newshound
your filthy scandal sheet ever had.
- Ooh!

67
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,575
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

68
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,369
Yeah, I got all your copy.

69
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,830
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to write it in Greek?

70
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,500
That was free verse,
you gashouse palooka.

71
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,503
What was free about it?
It cost this paper dough...

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,797
and it's not gonna
cost us any more.

73
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,299
Mr. Gordon, he reversed
the charge on that call.

74
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,927
What? Why, you...

75
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,721
Say, listen, you.
When you get back to New York...

76
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,848
keep far away from this office.

77
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,852
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore, and you never will.

78
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,231
What did he say?

79
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,277
Oh, so you're changing
your tune, eh?

80
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,948
You're late with your apologies.

81
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,994
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged on hands and knees!

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,538
I hope this will be
a lesson to you!

83
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,415
That's telling him, isn't it?

84
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,083
Did we tell that baby, huh?

85
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,253
- Won't give me any more of his lip.
- You tell him!

86
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,256
I guess he knows now
how I feel about his job.

87
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,092
- I'll bet he does too.
- Is my chariot ready?

88
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,887
Your chariot awaiteth "withouteth,"
O mighty king.

89
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,598
Lead on, sire.

90
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,852
- Make way for the king.
- Make way for the king.

91
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,604
Long live the king.

92
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,024
Make way for the king.

93
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,031
Philadelphia. New York.
All aboard!

94
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,825
- Attaboy.
- Look out for the king's baggage.

95
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,619
Your good-bye chariot.

96
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,499
Scram!

97
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,880
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

98
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,258
Pillow, sir? Two bits.

99
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,427
A thousand miles
is a long trip.

100
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,804
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

101
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,099
Hey, driver!

102
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,311
If you'll move those newspapers,
I'll have a seat.

103
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,781
Hey, wait a minute!

104
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,660
- What do you think you're doing?
- Huh?

105
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,121
The papers... what's the idea
of throwing them out?

106
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,792
Oh, the papers?
That's a long story, my friend.

107
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,252
I never did like
sitting on newspapers.

108
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:04,423
I did it once, and the headlines
came off on my white pants.

109
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,635
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

110
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,847
They just followed me around town
and read the news
off the seat of my pants.

111
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,018
Oh, fresh guy, huh?
What you need's
a good sock on the nose.

112
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,064
Listen, partner...

113
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,525
you may not like my nose,
but I do.

114
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,652
I always wear it
out in the open...

115
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,363
where if anybody wants to sock it,
they can.

116
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,449
Oh, yeah?

117
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,578
That's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

118
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,039
Our conversation
could have been over long ago.

119
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,624
Oh, yeah?

120
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,544
If you keep that up,
we're not going to get anywhere.

121
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,587
Oh, yeah?

122
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,841
You got me. Yeah!

123
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,726
Excuse me, lady...

124
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,854
but that upon which
you sit is mine.

125
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,357
- I beg your pardon?
- Now, listen.

126
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,901
I put up a stiff fight
for that seat...

127
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,487
so if it's just the same
to you, scram.

128
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,074
Driver, are these seats
reserved?

129
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,451
No.
First come, first served.

130
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,037
- Thank you.
- Hey, driver.

131
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,165
These seats accommodate two,
don't they?

132
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,167
Maybe they do
and maybe they don't.

133
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,793
Thank you.

134
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,882
Move over.

135
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,217
This is a "maybe they do."

136
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:41,604
If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.

137
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,208
Next time you drop in,
bring your folks.

138
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,772
Red-hot coffee, folks. Yes, sir.

139
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,149
Come on inside and enjoy yourselves.
Hot dogs, folks.

140
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,361
You can't enjoy the ride unless
you put something in your stomach.

141
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,529
Rest station.
Fifteen minutes.

142
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,324
- We'll only be here 15 minutes.
- Red-hot coffee.

143
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,160
Right around there, boss.

144
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,955
Yes, sir! Red-hot coffee.
Hot dogs.

145
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,416
You can't enjoy the ride unless
you put something in your stomach.

146
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:30,254
He got away.
 I suddenly found myself in the brush and not a sign of the skunk.

147
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,508
I don't know what you're raving about,
young man, and furthermore,
I'm not interested.

148
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,677
Well, of all the...

149
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,306
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag's gone.

150
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,268
- Oh, my heavens, it's gone!
- I knew you'd catch on eventually.

151
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,104
Oh! What am
I going to do now!

152
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,231
Don't tell me
your ticket was in it.

153
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,902
No, I've got that, but not my money.
All I have is four dollars.

154
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,905
You can wire home for more
when you get to Jacksonville.

155
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,825
No, I can't...
Yes, I guess I will.

156
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,579
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.
- No! Thank you. I'd rather you didn't.

157
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,665
Don't be a fool.
The company ought to make good.

158
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,209
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported.

159
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,545
That's ridiculous.
The company will take care...

160
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,714
Can you understand English?

161
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,133
Would you please
keep out of my affairs?

162
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,469
I want to be left alone.

163
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,475
Why, you ungrateful brat.

164
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,226
Board!

165
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,978
All aboard!

166
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,274
Board!

167
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,449
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

168
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,541
Jacksonville. Thirty minutes
for breakfast, folks.

169
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,003
- Only 30 minutes for breakfast
- Read all about it!

170
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,964
Just 30 minutes.
That's all. No more.

171
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,758
Thirty minutes for breakfast, folks.
That's all.

172
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,136
Read all about it!

173
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,555
Just 30 minutes for breakfast.
That's all.

174
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,491
Oh.

175
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,285
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

176
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,705
Silly, isn't it?

177
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,292
Why, everybody's gone!

178
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,422
Oh.
Thank you very much.

179
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,092
We're in Jacksonville,
aren't we?

180
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,802
Yes.

181
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,098
That was foolish of me.

182
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,435
W-Well, why didn't you
shove me away?

183
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,604
I hated to wake you up.

184
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,440
You look kind of pretty asleep.

185
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,442
How about some breakfast?

186
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,694
Oh, no, no.
No, thank you.

187
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,531
No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

188
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,284
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in half an hour.

189
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,662
Oh, no.
They'll wait for me.

190
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,209
Driver, I'm going to be
a few minutes late.

191
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,295
- Be sure to wait for me.
- Oh, yeah?

192
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,506
Yes.

193
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,322
- Where's the bus to New York?
- It left about 20 minutes ago.

194
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,283
But that's ridiculous.

195
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,035
I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

196
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,204
I'm sorry, miss,
but it's gone.

197
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,123
Good morning.

198
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,002
Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

199
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,755
Seems to me
I've already thanked you for that.

200
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,675
- What time is the next bus?
- 8:00 tonight.

201
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,720
Eight o'clo...
That's 12 hours!

202
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm sorry, miss.

203
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,475
What's the matter?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

204
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,061
What are you excited about?
You missed it too.

205
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,855
Yeah, I missed it too.

206
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,692
Don't tell me
you did it on my account.

207
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,155
I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night...

208
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,825
Look here, young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

209
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,495
- I can take care of myself.
- You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.

210
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,706
Here's your ticket.

211
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,958
- My ticket?
- I found it on the seat.

212
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,548
Thank you.

213
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,343
It must have fallen
out of my purse.

214
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,221
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

215
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,016
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,145
Your father will stop you
before you get halfway to New York.

217
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,107
You must have me confused
with someone else.

218
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,401
Quit kidding.
It's all over the front page.

219
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,036
I've always been curious to know
what kind of girl would marry...

220
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,372
a front-page aviator
like King Westley.

221
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,999
Take my advice:
Grab the next bus back to Miami.

222
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,085
That guy's a phony.

223
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,422
I didn't ask for your advice.

224
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,425
That's right. You didn't.

225
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,303
You're not going to notify
my father, are you?

226
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,180
What for?

227
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:59,101
- You probably could get
some money out of him.
- I never thought of that.

228
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,729
If you promise not to,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

229
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:07,275
You won't gain anything
by giving me away
as long as I make it worth your while.

230
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,446
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.
It's terribly important to me.

231
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,116
I'd pay you now,
only the only thing I had...

232
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:18,286
when I jumped off was a wristwatch,
and I had to pawn that to get clothes.

233
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:22,749
I'll give you my address.
Get in touch with me
the minute you get to New York.

234
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,294
Never mind. I had you pegged
right from the jump...

235
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,505
just a spoiled brat
of a rich father.

236
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,174
The only way
you get anything is to buy it.

237
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,554
You're in a jam,
and all you can think of is your money.
It never fails, does it?

238
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,597
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

239
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,101
No, you wouldn't. I guess
it never occurred to you to just say...

240
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,937
"Please, mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

241
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,314
No. That'd bring you down
off your high horse.

242
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,986
Let me tell you something:
You don't have to worry about me.

243
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm not interested in your money
or your problem.

244
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,451
You, King Westley, your father...
you're all a lot of hooey to me.

245
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,041
Do you send
telegrams here?

246
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,961
I'm just fine, thanks.
And how are you?

247
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,635
"To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

248
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,179
"Am I laughing.

249
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,140
The biggest scoop of the year
just dropped in my lap.

250
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,267
I know where
Ellen Andrews is."

251
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,436
No! Do you really?

252
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,730
Go on, go on.
Send the telegram.

253
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,858
"How would you like to have
the story, you big tub of..."

254
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,651
um, "of..."

255
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,862
- "Mush."
- "Tub of mush.

256
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,239
Well, try and get it.
What I said about...

257
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,992
never writing another line
for you still goes.

258
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,328
Are you burning?
Peter Warne."

259
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,371
That'll be $2.60.

260
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,415
- Send it collect.
- "Collect"?

261
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,125
Collect.

262
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,215
Bus leaving for Savannah,
Charleston, Columbia...

263
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,968
Greensborough, Richmond,
Washington, Baltimore...

264
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,346
Philadelphia, New York.

265
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,475
Savannah,
Charleston, Columbia...

266
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,936
Greensborough,
Richmond...

267
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,230
Washington, Baltimore...

268
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,070
All aboard!

269
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,708
Hi, sister. All alone?

270
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,919
My name's Shapeley.
Might as well get acquainted.

271
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,422
It's gonna be a long trip. Gets tiresome,
especially for somebody like you.

272
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,677
You look like you've got class.
Yes, sir, with a capital K.

273
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,639
And I'm the guy that knows class
when he sees it, believe you me.

274
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,268
Ask the boys. They'll tell you:
"Shapeley knows how to pick 'em."

275
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,146
Yes, sir. Shapeley's the name,
and that's the way I like 'em.

276
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,274
You made no mistake
sitting next to me.

277
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,694
The mugs on a hop like this
ain't nothin' to write home about.

278
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,530
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

279
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,116
You can't be
too particular neither.

280
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,743
What's the matter, sister?
You ain't sayin' much.

281
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,538
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

282
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,332
That's pretty good.

283
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,544
"Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance."

284
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,131
Well, shut my big nasty mouth!

285
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,217
Looks like
you're one up on me.

286
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,470
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

287
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,556
that can snap 'em back at ya.

288
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,184
The colder they are, the hotter they get.
That's what I always say.

289
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,980
Yes, sir.
When a cold mama gets hot...

290
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,982
boy, how she sizzles!

291
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,445
You're just my type.

292
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,990
Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.

293
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,075
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley,"
they call me...

294
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,454
with accent on the "fun,"
believe you me.

295
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,041
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

296
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,795
Looks like
you're two up on me now.

297
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,256
- Hey, you.
- Huh?

298
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,843
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

299
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,430
I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

300
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,849
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

301
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,726
Come on, come on.

302
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,103
Oh, yeah, sure.
Excuse me.

303
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,356
I was just...
Excuse me, miss.

304
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,817
I just was trying to make things
pleasant, you see?

305
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,987
Excuse me. I...
I didn't mean anything, doc.

306
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,658
- Uh, n-no offense, doc.
- No.

307
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,451
No.

308
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,918
If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.

309
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,212
Forget it.
I didn't do it for you.

310
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,381
His voice gets on my nerves.

311
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,390
What'd you do all day?

312
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,394
Ran in and out of doorways
trying to keep out of the rain.

313
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,648
Your clothes are all wet.

314
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,986
Here.

315
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,489
- You're as helpless as a baby.
- Thank you.

316
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,158
Here you are, folks:
cigars, cigarettes...

317
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,619
chewing gum,
candy, magazines.

318
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,371
Here, boy.

319
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,500
- Yes, ma'am?
- A box of chocolates, please.

320
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,419
Never mind.
She doesn't want it.

321
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,504
- But the lady...
- Of course I do!

322
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,464
Beat it!

323
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,467
You've got your nerve!
Here, boy.

324
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,805
Dollar and 60 cents.

325
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,099
You had four dollars last night.

326
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,853
How do you expect to get to New York
at the rate you're going?

327
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,771
That is none of your business.

328
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,232
You're on a budget
from now on.

329
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,360
- Just a minute. You can't...
- Shut up.

330
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,260
- What's the matter, Officer?
- Bridge washout.

331
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,429
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

332
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,057
If any of you passengers
want a place to sleep...

333
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,726
you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

334
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,187
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

335
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,439
- Oh, yeah.
- Dyke's Auto Camp.

336
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,733
All right, thanks.
Hey, brat.

337
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,069
Are you talking to me?

338
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,155
Yeah. Come on.
We're stopping here for the night.

339
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:46,091
- Thank you.
- Hey, come on! We're all set!

340
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,894
Good evening.

341
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,438
Hope you and your husband
rest comfortable.

342
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,448
Come on, come on.

343
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,450
You going to stay there all night?

344
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,807
Darn clever, these Armenians.

345
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,934
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a gift.

346
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:43,022
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to...

347
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,316
as my husband.

348
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,279
Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you:
I registered as "Mr. and Mrs."

349
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,281
- Oh, you did?
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,618
What am I expected to do?
Leap for joy?

351
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,079
I kind of half expected you
to thank me.

352
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,041
Your ego is
absolutely colossal.

353
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,003
Yeah, yeah. Not bad.
How's yours?

354
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,761
You know,
compared to you...

355
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,097
my friend Shapeley
is an amateur.

356
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,977
Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?

357
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,770
Now, wait a minute.

358
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,981
Let's get this
straightened out right now.

359
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,902
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

360
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,279
You're just a headline to me.

361
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,740
A headline?

362
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,284
You're not a newspaperman,
are you?

363
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,245
Chalk up one for your side.

364
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,874
Now, listen. You want to get
to King Westley, don't you?

365
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,918
All right.
I'm here to help you.

366
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,003
What I want is your story.

367
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,923
Exclusive.
A day-to-day account.

368
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,467
All about your mad flight
to happiness.

369
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,054
I need that story.
Between you and me,
I've got to have it.

370
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,143
Isn't that just too cute?

371
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,981
There's a brain behind that face
of yours, isn't there?

372
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,068
You've got everything
nicely figured out for yourself...

373
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,986
including this.

374
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,989
This? That's a matter
of simple mathematics.

375
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,242
These cabins cost
two bucks a night...

376
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,869
and I'm very sorry to inform you,
wifey dear...

377
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,664
that the family purse won't stand
for separate establishments.

378
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,089
Well, thank you.

379
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,883
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

380
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,511
It's all right with me.
Go out in the storm.

381
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,680
But I'm going
to follow you, see?

382
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,641
Yeah.
And if you get tough...

383
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,353
I'll just have to turn you over
to your old man... right now.

384
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,481
Savvy? Now, that's
my whole plot in a nutshell.

385
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,860
A simple story
for simple people.

386
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,780
If you behave,
I'll see that you get to King Westley.

387
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:59,200
If not, I'll just have to spill
the beans to Papa.

388
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,538
Now, uh, which of these beds
do you prefer?

389
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,292
This one? All right.

390
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,525
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

391
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,986
Oh, this?

392
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,532
I like privacy when I retire.

393
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,827
I'm very delicate in that respect.
Prying eyes annoy me.

394
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,001
Behold the walls of Jericho.

395
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,796
Maybe not as thick as the ones
Joshua blew down with his trumpet...

396
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,590
but a lot safer.

397
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,801
You see,
I have no trumpet.

398
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,512
Just to show you
my heart's in the right place...

399
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,681
I'll give you
my best pair of pajamas.

400
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,478
Do you mind
joining the Israelites?

401
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,815
You don't want to join the Israelites?
All right.

402
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,778
Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

403
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:20,031
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

404
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,824
No two men do it alike.

405
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,787
I knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

406
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,830
He made a picture!

407
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,249
Years later,
his secret came out.

408
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,336
He wore a toupee. Yeah.

409
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,463
I have a method all my own.

410
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,673
If you'll notice,
the coat came first...

411
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,301
then the tie,
then the shirt.

412
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,470
Now, according to Hoyle...

413
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,014
after that,
the pants should be next.

414
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,935
There's where I'm different:
I go for the shoes next.

415
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,728
First the right...

416
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,189
then the left.

417
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,816
After that...

418
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,735
it's every man for himself.

419
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,260
Still with me, brat?

420
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,348
Ah, don't be a sucker.

421
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,476
A good night's rest
will do you good.

422
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,979
Besides, you've got nothing
to worry about.

423
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,441
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

424
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,625
♪ Who's afraid
of the big bad wolf ♪

425
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,087
♪ The big bad wolf
The big bad wolf ♪

426
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,590
♪ She's afraid
of the big bad wolf ♪

427
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,967
♪ Tra, la, la, la, la ♪♪

428
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,055
Would you mind
please putting out the light?

429
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,558
No, not at all.

430
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,392
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

431
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,770
Oh, excuse me.

432
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,464
By the way,
what's your name?

433
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,424
What's that?

434
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,468
Who are you?

435
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,763
Who, me?

436
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:35,059
I'm the whippoorwill
that cries in the night.

437
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:39,355
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

438
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,108
You've got a name,
haven't you?

439
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,778
Yeah, I got a name:
Peter Warne.

440
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,573
"Peter Warne."

441
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,449
I don't like it.

442
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,161
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me
in the morning.

443
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,541
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Warne.

444
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:02,920
The pleasure is all mine,
Mrs. Warne.

445
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,608
Another message, sir.

446
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,736
- What is it?
- It's from Charleston, Mr. Andrews.

447
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,531
"Checking every northbound train.
Also assigned 20 operators
to watch highways.

448
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,035
No sign of your daughter yet.
Will continue to do everything possible.

449
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,037
Signed,
Lovington Detective Agency."

450
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,414
Just the same
as all the others.

451
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,542
- Yes, sir?
- I made it clear
I was in a hurry to get to New York.

452
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,295
- What are we crawling for?
- I've got it wide open, sir.

453
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,005
- Step on it!
- Yes, sir.

454
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,174
Oh, I hope she's all right, sir.

455
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,718
"All right"?
Of course she's all right.

456
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,762
What could happen to her?

457
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,640
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it!

458
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,540
Hello?

459
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,544
Hey, mister.

460
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,758
Oh, hello.

461
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,094
What's the matter?
You not up yet?

462
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,262
- What time is it?
- 8:00.

463
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,764
Here.

464
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,393
What... Oh, it's a toothbrush.
Thanks.

465
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,019
My dress...

466
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,896
you had it pressed!

467
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,107
Come on.
Breakfast will be ready.

468
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,442
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

469
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,988
I'm gonna count ten.
If you're not out of that bed,
I'm coming and drag you out.

470
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,033
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- I really think you would.

471
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,952
- seven, eight, nine...
- I'm out, I'm out.

472
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,246
I'm out. I'm out.

473
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,290
You'll find the showers and things
just behind the second cottage.

474
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,961
Outside?

475
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,296
Certainly. All the best homes
have them outside.

476
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,385
Really, I-I can't
go out like this.

477
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,971
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

478
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,889
Oh. Here.

479
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,808
- Use mine.
- Oh, thanks.

480
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,727
Come on.
Make it snappy.

481
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,563
It's not my fault.
You got the sleeve.

482
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,941
- Here. Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

483
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,487
Where'd you say
the showers and things were?

484
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,740
Here.
Here's a towel.

485
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,658
Thank you.

486
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,746
You're kind of little,
aren't you?

487
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,415
- Where's the shower?
- Your hair's cute like that.

488
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,334
- You should never comb it.
- I'll find it myself.

489
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,578
Are the showers in there?

490
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,705
Well, they ain't out here.

491
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,373
Thank you.

492
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,713
Can't a body
have a little privacy around here?

493
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:41,180
- That serves her right.
- If you want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

494
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,360
Ah, hi, sister.
You remember me? Shapeley?

495
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,404
I'm sorry about last night.
Didn't know you was married.

496
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,865
You shoulda told me right off.
♪ Mm-mm ♪

497
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,418
High time you got back.

498
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,838
I met some very interesting
women at the showers.

499
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:17,299
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

500
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,051
Mm.

501
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,847
Come on, sit down.

502
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,476
My, my, my.
Scrambled eggs.

503
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,687
"Egg." One egg.

504
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,232
One doughnut. Black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

505
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,609
- Any complaints?
- No, no complaints.

506
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:39,154
I'd have gotten cream,
but it'd have meant buying a whole pint.

507
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,407
You don't have
to apologize to me.

508
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,784
You'll never know
how much I appreciate all this.

509
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,704
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

510
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,455
It must be the spring.

511
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,709
I thought "believe you me"
told you a couple snappy stories.

512
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,461
Oh, no.
He apologized for last night.

513
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,463
Said he didn't know
we were married.

514
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,924
Just shows you
how wrong a guy can be.

515
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,511
Doughnut?

516
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,097
Thanks.

517
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,893
You think this whole business is silly,
don't you? I mean, running away.

518
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,186
No, no.
Makes too good a story.

519
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,607
Yes, you do. You think
I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

520
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,484
Perhaps I am,
though I don't see how I can be.

521
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,446
Spoiled people are accustomed
to having their way. I never have.

522
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,990
I've always been told
what to do...

523
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,619
and how to do it
and when and with whom.

524
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,748
Would you believe it?
This is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man.

525
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,500
- Yeah.
- It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

526
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,961
Mm-hmm.
You're doing all right.

527
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,005
Thanks.

528
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,633
Nurses, governesses...

529
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,344
chaperones,
even bodyguards.

530
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,348
- Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
- One consolation:
You can never get lonesome.

531
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,768
Mm. It has its moments.
It's become a sort of game...

532
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,187
trying to outwit
Father's detectives.

533
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:57,066
I did once. I actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

534
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,902
It was swell.
I felt absolutely immoral.

535
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,947
It didn't last long.
They caught me in a department store.

536
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,407
I was so mad,
I ran out the back...

537
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,743
and jumped
into the first car I saw.

538
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,455
- Guess who was in it.
- Santa Claus. Gandhi.

539
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,959
King Westley was in it.

540
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,252
- Is that how you met him?
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,130
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

542
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,217
By 6:00 he was having
all the rivers dragged.

543
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,597
Say, where'd you learn to dunk?
In finishing school?

544
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,141
Don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.

545
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,103
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.
Dunking's an art.

546
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:38,107
Don't let it soak so long.
A dip... and sock! Into your mouth.

547
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:42,695
Let it hang too long, it'll get soft
and fall off. All a matter of timing.

548
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,739
- I'll write a book about it.
- Thanks, Professor.

549
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,660
Just goes to show you: 20 millions,
and you don't know how to dunk.

550
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,038
I'd change places
with a plumber's daughter any day.

551
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,583
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

552
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,711
You can't go around
bothering my tenants.

553
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,130
There's no girl
by that name here.

554
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,132
Besides, how do I know
you're detectives?

555
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,300
Show him your credentials, Mac.

556
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,431
- Detectives!
- Oh!

557
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,017
That's Father at work.
Peter, what'll I do?

558
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,936
Maybe I can jump out the window.
They won't see me.

559
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,688
Sit down.
Get yourself mussed up.

560
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,983
Get your hair down over your eyes
and your blouse unfastened.

561
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,945
Yeah, I got a letter
from Aunt Bella last week.

562
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,365
If we don't stop over to Wilkes-Barre,
she'll never forgive us.

563
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,451
- What are you talking about?
- Shh!

564
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,412
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

565
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,958
Uh... Oh, yeah.
She saw your sister the other day.
Said she's looking swell.

566
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,465
- Come in.
- I hope Aunt Bella has a boy.

567
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,926
Grandma says it's a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

568
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,097
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

569
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,433
Me?
You want to see me?

570
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,144
- What's your name?
- Are you addressin' me?

571
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,105
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Hey, wait a minute.

572
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,191
That's my wife
you're talking to.

573
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,860
What do you mean, coming here?
What do you want?

574
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,153
We're looking for somebody.

575
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,655
Look your head off,
but don't come in here.

576
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,325
I've got a notion
to take a sock at you.

577
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,952
- Take it easy, son.
- These men are detectives.

578
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,082
I don't care if they're police.
They can't bust in here
shooting questions at my wife.

579
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,043
Don't get so excited.
The man asked a simple question.

580
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,003
Oh, is that so?

581
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,881
How many times have I told you
to stop butting in?

582
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,802
- You don't have to lose your temper.
-  - "You don't have to lose your temper."

583
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:34,973
Every time I try to protect you!
The other night at the dance,
when that Swede made a pass...

584
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,101
He didn't make
a pass at me!

585
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:41,438
- He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.
- He didn't. You were drunk.

586
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,607
Ah, nuts! You're just like
your old man!

587
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,859
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

588
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,195
Ain't an ounce of brains
in your family!

589
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,406
- You've gone far enough!
- Ah, shut up!

590
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,534
See what you've done?

591
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,954
Sorry, Mr. Warne, but we've got
to check up on everybody.

592
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,583
We're looking for Ellen Andrews,
the daughter of that Wall Street mug.

593
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,128
Too bad you ain't looking
for a plumber's daughter.

594
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,463
Quit bawling!

595
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,217
I told you they were
a perfectly nice married couple.

596
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,440
You weren't bad,
jumping in like that.

597
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,443
- You've got a brain, haven't you?
- You're not so bad yourself.

598
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,445
We could start
a two-people stock company.

599
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,948
If things get tough,
we'll play the small-town auditoriums.

600
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,450
We'll call this one
The Great Deception.

601
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,870
What about Cinderella
or A Real Hot Love Story?

602
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,205
- No, too mushy.
- I like mushy stuff.

603
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,543
Quit bawling!
You're just like...

604
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,044
- Five minutes.
- What?

605
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,713
Your bus leaves
in five minutes.

606
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,508
Oh! Holy smoke!
We're not even packed yet.

607
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,725
- I'm beginning to believe
you fellas couldn't find your way home.

608
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,685
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

609
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,313
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

610
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,440
Warne?
Throw it in the wastebasket.

611
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,151
Wait a minute.
What does it say?

612
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,112
"Have I got a story.
Stop.

613
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,073
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.
Hope you're the same."

614
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,994
- Collect?
- Yes.

615
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,121
If you accept another one,
you're fired.

616
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,499
- Yes sir.
- That gives me a good idea
for all of you!

617
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,376
I want action, Lovington!

618
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,588
- We can't do the impossible.
- What I'm asking isn't impossible.

619
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,549
My daughter is between here
and Miami. I want her found.

620
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,677
- I put extra men on all along the way.
- That's not enough.

621
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,805
Send in Clark and Brown.
You're sure she isn't with King Westley?

622
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,975
No. He's been trailed 24 hours a day
since this thing started.

623
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:46,313
- He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.
- I'm worried, Lovington.

624
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,982
- Something might have happened to her.
- I don't think so.

625
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,818
Brown, make arrangements
for a radio broadcast.

626
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:54,196
Coast-to-coast hookup.
Offer a reward of $10,000...

627
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,198
for information
leading to her whereabouts.

628
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,201
- Yes. sir.
- Clark, send the story
to all the newspapers.

629
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,912
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

630
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,872
Here.
Wire this to them.

631
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,625
- I want the story to break right away.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,710
Now we'll get some action!

633
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,291
That's fine. Say, fellas...

634
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,836
do you know that one about the man
who flew on the trapeze?

635
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,796
- Sure.
- Oh, yeah.

636
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,257
- "Flying Trapeze."
- Attaboy.

Ma! What's the matter
with you?

00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,321
Somebody help us!
Something's happened to her!

684
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,949
Get some water, somebody.
Let me in there, son.

685
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,869
You got some smelling salts?

686
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,579
Ma!

687
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,417
Come on. Let's give your mother
a chance to snap out of it.

688
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,463
Don't worry.
She'll be all right in a few minutes.

689
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,050
We ain't ate nothing
since yesterday.

690
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,136
Oh? What happened
to your money?

691
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,347
Ma spent it all on the tickets.

692
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,600
We didn't know
it was gonna be so much.

693
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,478
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

694
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,232
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

695
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,860
and if we didn't go,
she might lose it.

696
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,742
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

697
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:55,163
Here, honey. The next town
we come to, buy some food. Come on.

698
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,792
I shouldn't oughta take this.
Ma'll get mad.

699
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:02,337
Don't tell her. You don't want her
to get sick again, do you?

700
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,756
- No, but you might need it.
- Come on.

701
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,425
- I got millions.
- Gee, thanks.

702
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,636
Come on.
Let's go back to your mother.

703
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,656
- Better phone for help.
- You can if you want.

704
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,825
The nearest town is
10 miles from here.

705
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,160
- Yeah?
- Say, buddy...

706
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:37,163
like to take a look
at my paper?

707
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,710
Traveling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

708
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,046
Take that story there,
for instance.

709
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,466
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

710
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:52,262
- No, what?
- I'd go 50-50 with you.

711
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,806
- Why?
- Because I don't believe
in hogging it, see?

712
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,435
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

713
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,895
That's what I always say.

714
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,025
What's on your mind?

715
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,402
Five Gs or I crab the works.

716
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,369
Let's get away from this gang,
talk this over privately.

717
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,913
I knew she wasn't your wife
all the time.

718
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:26,212
You know, lucky thing, my running
into you. Just the man I need.

719
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,591
- You made no mistake.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

720
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,885
When you're talking to Shapeley,
you're talking to...

721
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,845
You pack a gat?

722
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,473
- Huh?
- A gat, a gat.

723
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,808
A rod.
Got any fireworks on you?

724
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,685
Why, no.

725
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,313
It's all right. I got machine guns
in my suitcase.

726
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:46,232
I'll let you have one.
We may have trouble up north...

727
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,360
have to shoot it out
with the cops.

728
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:52,072
But if you come through, those five Gs
are in the bag... maybe more.

729
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:55,450
- I'll talk with the Killer,
see he takes care of you.
- "Killer"?

730
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,244
Yeah, the big boy.
The boss of the outfit.

731
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,622
You're not kidnapping her,
are you?

732
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,459
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

733
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,587
- Ten thousand bucks?
- Chicken feed.

734
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,299
Hey, listen. We're holding that dame
for a million smackers.

735
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,512
I didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, I've got...

736
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,931
What's the matter?
You getting yellow?

737
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:21,017
I'm married, a couple kids.
I can't afford to...

738
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,479
Shh! Pipe down,
you mug, before I...

739
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,607
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

740
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,610
Listen, you're into this thing,
and you're staying in, get me?

741
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,278
You know too much.

742
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,155
I-I won't say anything, honest.

743
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,409
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

744
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,577
Why should I take
a chance with you?

745
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,705
Trust me, mister,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

746
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,331
Yeah?

747
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,501
What's your name?

748
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,378
Oscar Shapeley.

749
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:51,131
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

750
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,091
Got a couple of kids, huh?

751
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,386
Y-Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl...

752
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,139
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

753
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,141
Why, you wouldn't...
You're not thinking...

754
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,060
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure, sure!

755
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,604
- If you don't...
- I will, I will.

756
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,149
You ever hear
of Bugs Dooley?

757
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,025
B-B-Bugs Dooley? No.

758
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:14,404
A nice guy, like you,
but he made a mistake one day.

759
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,532
Got too talkative.
Know what happened to his kid?

760
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:21,244
- No.
- I can't tell you, but when Bugs heard,
he blew his brains out.

761
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,830
Oh, gee, that's terrible.
Terrible.

762
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,416
He had it coming, though.
He talked too much.

763
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,461
I never talk. I never say a word.
W-Word of honor.

764
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,338
Gee, I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

765
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,175
Okay.
Just remember that.

766
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,885
Now beat it.

767
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,220
Sure, mister.
Thanks.

768
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,347
I always knew you guys were...

769
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,350
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

770
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,811
Sure.
Anything you say, mister.

771
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,731
- Ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
- If you don't beat it...

772
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,191
I'm going.

773
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,666
- Come on!
- Why do we have to leave the bus?

774
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,585
Come on.
Don't ask so many questions.

775
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,212
Why?

776
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,721
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't
have frightened him like that.

777
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,391
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

778
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:29,145
Say, why did we have
to leave the bus?

779
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:33,399
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

780
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:37,529
You know, I've been doing
a little thinking myself.

781
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,698
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

782
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,951
What's the matter?
Are you weakening?

783
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,495
No.
No, just thinking of you.

784
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,622
A starvation diet
may not agree with you.

785
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,041
Did you give that child
all your money?

786
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,752
I didn't give him anything.
You were the bighearted gal.

787
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,088
All the money I had
was that ten-spot...

788
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,424
so I've been thinking
you better wire your father.

789
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,218
No, sir.

790
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,596
I started out for New York,
and I'm going to get there...

791
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,391
- if I have to starve all the way.
- Okay.

792
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,601
What is this strange power...

793
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,229
this man Westley has
over you women?

794
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,273
Here. Take these.

795
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,733
Hold on to them.
Get up on that log.

796
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,027
- Huh?
- Get up on the log.

797
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,656
Come on.

798
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,290
I wish you'd stop
being playful.

799
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,584
Oh, so sorry. Sorry.

800
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,962
This is the first time in years
I've ridden piggyback.

801
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,506
- This isn't piggyback.
- Of course it is.

802
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,466
You're crazy.

803
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,345
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

804
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,556
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

805
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,517
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

806
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,270
My uncle, Mother's brother,
has four children...

807
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,063
and I've seen them
ride piggyback.

808
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,233
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

809
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,737
I never knew a rich man yet
who could piggyback ride.

810
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,323
You're prejudiced.

811
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:06,451
Show me a good piggybacker,
and I'll show you a real human.

812
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,495
Take Abraham Lincoln:
a natural born piggybacker.

813
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:12,749
Where do you get off
with that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

814
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,837
My father was
a great piggybacker.

815
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,882
Here, hold this a minute.

816
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,470
- Ow! Oh!
- Thank you.

817
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:34,437
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

818
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,620
This looks like the best spot.

819
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,331
We're not going to sleep
out here, are we?

820
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,167
I'm going to give
a good imitation of it.

821
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,544
Peter?

822
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,380
What?

823
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,382
I'm awfully hungry.

824
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,843
- Oh, it's just your imagination.
- No, it isn't.

825
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,721
I'm hungry and...
and scared.

826
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,724
You can't be hungry and scared
both at the same time.

827
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,561
- Well, I am.
- If you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.

828
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,147
Not if you're more hungry
than scared.

829
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,024
All right, you win.

830
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,151
Let's forget about it.

831
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,364
I can't forget it.
I'm still hungry.

832
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,491
Holy smoke!

833
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,411
Why did I ever get
mixed up with you?

834
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,831
If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.

835
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:36,624
What about your story?

836
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,544
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

837
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,295
Mm, mm!

838
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,258
I turned out to be
the prize sucker.

839
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:49,929
All right, come on.
Your bed's all ready.

840
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,932
I'll get my clothes
all wrinkled.

841
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,767
- Then take 'em off.
- What?

842
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,437
All right, don't.
Do whatever you please...

843
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,522
but shut up about it.

844
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,764
You know, you're becoming
awfully disagreeable lately.

845
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,559
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

846
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:42,482
If being with me
is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.

847
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:47,487
You can leave
anytime you see fit.

848
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,655
Nobody's holding you here.

849
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,326
I can get along.

850
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,625
Peter?

851
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,004
Peter!

852
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,591
Oh, Peter! Peter!

853
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,635
Peter! Peter!

854
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,720
Peter! Oh, Peter!

855
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,889
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

856
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:18,726
What got into you? I went to try
and find you something to eat.

857
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,853
- I know, but...
- Here.

858
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,856
- Here, eat your head off.
- I don't want it now.

859
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,734
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but...

860
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,611
But what?

861
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,822
I was so scared,
it scared the hung...

862
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,991
Holy jumpin' catfish!
You'd drive a guy crazy!

863
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,204
It's liable to get chilly before morning.
You better use this.

864
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,910
What are you thinking about?

865
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,581
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

866
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,625
Really?

867
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,002
Yeah.

868
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:11,631
I was just wondering
what makes dames like you so dizzy.

869
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,334
What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?

870
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,127
Hitchhiking.

871
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:51,921
Oh.

872
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,758
Well, you've given me
a very good example of the hiking.

873
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,052
Where does the hitching
come in?

874
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,596
A little early yet.
No cars out.

875
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,143
If it's just the same to you...

876
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,522
I'm going to sit right here
and wait till they come.

877
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,701
Ooh.
You got a toothpick?

878
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,578
- What's the matter?
- Got hay in my teeth.

879
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:28,374
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here. I got a penknife, though.

880
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,294
- Hold still.
- Be careful.

881
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,337
- Where is it?
- Right in the middle.

882
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,464
The middle?
All right. Hold still.

883
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,009
Real still.
All right. There.

884
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,220
- Get it?
- Mm, thanks.

885
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,598
You should've swallowed that.
You're not gonna have breakfast.

886
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,767
Oh, you needn't rub it in.

887
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,399
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

888
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,776
- Raw?
- Mm-hmm. Want one?

889
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,778
No!

890
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,239
Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

891
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:04,744
Oh, that's right. I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

892
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,830
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

893
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:10,583
Better have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

894
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:13,377
I hate the horrid things.

895
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:18,424
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
We let a car get away.

896
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,052
So suppose nobody
stops for us, huh?

897
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,555
They'll stop, all right.
It's a matter of knowing how to hail 'em.

898
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,557
Oh, and you're an expert,
I suppose.

899
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,768
"Expert"?
I'm gonna write a book about it.

900
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,895
Call it The Hitchhiker's Hail.

901
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,773
There's no end
to your accomplishments, is there?

902
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,941
- You think it's simple, huh?
- Oh, no.

903
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:38,944
It is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?

904
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:40,946
Some people do it like this...

905
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,990
or like this.

906
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,285
- All wrong. Never get anywhere.
- Aw, the poor things.

907
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,454
But that old thumb
never fails.

908
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,582
It's all a matter
of how you do it, though.

909
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,584
You take number one,
for instance.

910
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,795
That's a short, jerky movement,
like this.

911
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,465
Shows independence. You don't care
whether they stop. You got money.

912
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:00,966
- Clever.
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:05,346
Number two's a wider movement.
A smile goes with this one, like this.

914
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:10,142
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

915
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,813
Mm, mm! You figured that out
all by yourself?

916
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,732
Ah, that's nothing.
Number three is a pip.

917
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:20,444
That's the pitiful one,
when you're broke and hungry,
and everything looks black.

918
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,280
It's a long, sweeping movement.
Got to follow through, though.

919
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,659
That's amazing.

920
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:29,578
But it's no good
if you haven't got a long face.

921
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,455
Here comes a car.

922
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,958
Okay, watch me.
I'm gonna use number one.

923
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,627
Keep your eye on that thumb
and see what happens.

924
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,761
I still got my eye
on the thumb.

925
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,806
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try number two.

926
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,934
Well, when you get to a hundred,
wake me up.

927
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,852
I don't think I'll write
that book after all.

928
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,980
Think of all the fun
you had, though.

929
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,483
Do you mind if I try?

930
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,903
You?

931
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,864
Don't make me laugh.

932
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,991
Oh, you're such a smart aleck.

933
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,452
Nobody knows anything but you.

934
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,371
I'll stop a car,
and I won't use my thumb.

935
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:56,749
What are you gonna do?

936
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,710
It's a system all my own.

937
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,274
Aren't you going
to give me a little credit?

938
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,151
What for?

939
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,320
Well, I proved
once and for all...

940
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,281
that the limb is mightier
than the thumb.

941
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,952
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

942
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,579
Ooh, I'll remember that
when we need 40 cars.

943
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,082
So you're just married, huh?

944
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,125
That's pretty good.

945
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,294
But if I was young...

946
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,089
that's the way I'd spend
my honeymoon: hitchhiking.

947
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,882
- Yeah.

01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,165
Sure, I was.
No fooling: I'm hungry.

969
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,542
Eat a carrot.

970
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,628
No.

971

- I'm going in and asking him.
- You do and I'll break your neck.

972
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:24,104
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

973
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,152
Come on.

974
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,633
I'm sorry I...

975
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,260
Oh, that's all right.

976
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:07,022
Hey! Hey!

977
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,024
Hey, come here!

978
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,236
Hey, you've got my suitcase!
Hey!

979
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,029
Hey, you!

980
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,032
Hey! Hey!

981
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,592
What happened to you?
I've been so worried.

982
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,428
- Get in.
- Look at your face!

983
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,221
- You've got a cut!
- Come on.

984
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,848
- What happened?
- Just a road thief.

985
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,976
Picks people up, then runs off
with their things. What a racket!

986
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:48,397
- How'd you get the car?
- Gave him a black eye.
Had to tie him to a tree.

987
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,765
Can't be much gas
left in this thing.

988
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:24,892
Got to start promoting some.

989
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:30,314
Better take the things
out of the pocket of that coat.

990
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,775
That ought to be good
for 10 gallons.

991
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:11,647
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

992
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:14,024
I don't like you.
Never have, never will.

993
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,151
That's clear enough,
isn't it?

994
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,821
You've made that evident
by your threats of annulment.

995
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,906
It hasn't worried me
for a minute.

996
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,242
Ellie and I married
because we love each other.

997
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,993
- Mm.
- And she's proving it.

998
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,663
As far as I'm concerned,
there's to be no annulment.

999
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,749
I see. You've got hold
of a good thing...

1000
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,836
and you're going
to hang on to it, eh?

1001
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:35,754
All right. You win.

1002
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,674
I guess I'll just have
to get used to you.

1003
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,050
I admit I'm licked...

1004
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,636
but it's only
because I'm worried.

1005
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:46,682
If I don't find her soon,
I'll go crazy.

1006
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:49,935
I might've been able to help
if it hadn't been for you.

1007
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:54,314
- I've been watched so closely...
- Yes, I know. Well, you can help now.

1008
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,025
I've got a room full
of reporters in there.

1009
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,278
Now I want you
to make a statement.

1010
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:03,282
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding...

1011
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:07,369
and that if she returns,
I won't interfere with your marriage.

1012
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,549
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

1013
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:24,386
- Okay.
- I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

1014
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,097
Yeah, so do I.
Thank you. Good night.

1015
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,807
Good night.

1016
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,686
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

1017
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,522
Yeah. He finally agreed
to let us have a cabin.

1018
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,483
- What about the money?
- I talked him out of that idea.

1019
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,362
He thinks we're staying a week.
I'll have to think something up
before morning.

1020
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:46,158
- That's swell.
- Yeah? I'm glad you think so.

1021
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,285
If you ask me,
I think it's foolish.

1022
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,163
I told you there's no use
staying here tonight.

1023
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:53,624
We could make New York
in three hours.

1024
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,088
I thought you were
in such a hurry to get back.

1025
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,798
Well, I...

1026
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,847
Well, whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?

1027
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,516
Everybody will be asleep.

1028
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,231
Okay.

1029
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,192
Cottage number six.

1030
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,220
There you go,
trusting people again.

1031
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,263
How many times did I tell you...

1032
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,976
But he looked like
a nice, upright young fellow, Ma.

1033
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,150
Well, we're on the last lap.

1034
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,157
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

1035
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,826
Yeah.

1036
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,454
You'll have a great story,
won't you?

1037
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,748
Yeah.

1038
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,583
Swell.

1039
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,690
Thank you.

1040
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,810
Well, we certainly
outsmarted your father.

1041
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,230
I guess you ought
to be happy.

1042
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,609
Am I going to see you
in New York?

1043
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,571
Nope.

1044
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,492
Why not?

1045
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:37,329
I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

1046
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,917
There's no harm
in your coming to see us.

1047
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,795
Not interested.

1048
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,133
Won't I ever see you again?

1049
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,345
What do you want to see me for?
I've served my purpose.

1050
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,348
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted.

1051
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,428
Have you ever been in love,
Peter?

1052
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,723
Me?

1053
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,434
Yes.

1054
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,355
Haven't you ever
thought about it at all?

1055
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,570
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

1056
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,657
Sure, I've thought about it.

1057
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,742
Who hasn't?

1058
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:03,999
If I could ever meet
the right sort of girl...

1059
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,501
Yeah, well,
where are you gonna find her?

1060
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,920
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

1061
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,089
They don't come
that way anymore.

1062
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,221
Have I ever thought about it?

1063
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,976
Boy, I've even been
sucker enough to make plans.

1064
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,273
You know...

1065
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,359
I saw an island
in the Pacific once.

1066
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,486
Never been able to forget it.

1067
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,450
That's where
I'd like to take her.

1068
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,455
But she'd have to be
the sort of girl who...

1069
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:48,084
who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

1070
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:52,923
You know...

1071
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,383
nights when
you and the moon...

1072
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:57,969
and the water
all become one...

1073
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:02,057
and you feel you're part
of something big and marvelous.

1074
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,896
That's the only place to live.

1075
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,315
The stars are so close
over your head...

1076
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,485
you feel you could reach up
and stir them around.

1077
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,368
Certainly I've been
thinking about it.

1078
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:26,248
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those thi...

1079
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:37,175
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

1080
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,804
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

1081
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,932
You'd better go back
to your bed.

1082
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,559
I love you.
Nothing else matters.

1083
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:50,272
We can run away.
Everything will take care of itself.

1084
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,023
Please, Peter.

1085
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:55,694
I can't let you
out of my life now.

1086
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,904
I couldn't live without you.

1087
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,129
You'd better go back
to your bed.

1088
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,056
I'm sorry.

1089
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:03,762
Hey, brat.

1090
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,431
Did you mean that?
Would you really go?

1091
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:49,641
All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

1092
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,559
That bag's worth $25.

1093
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,646
I got a bag.
My wife gave me one for Christmas.

1094
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:57,982
When I get back in the morning,
I'll buy it back.

1095
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,485
Give you a $10 profit.
What do you say?

1096
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,654
- I ain't got a hat.
- What?

1097
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:04,531
I ain't got a hat.

1098
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,575
You got one now!
Come on, fill 'er up.

1099
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,501
Peter, where you been
all this time?

1100
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,337
- Everybody been asking about you.
- Okay, Tony. Look.

1101
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,840
Get me one drink.
Don't let anybody disturb me.

1102
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,508
Sure, boss.

1103
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,721
- Hello, Agnes.
- Don't go in. He'll shoot you on sight.

1104
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,723
Haven't been shot at in days.

1105
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,725
Get out of here!
Get out!

1106
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,519
- Get out!
- Listen, Joe.

1107
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,771
- Don't "Joe" me.
- Joe, listen.

1108
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,690
You know I've always liked you.

1109
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,569
Anytime I ran across a good story,
I came running to you with it.

1110
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:46,322
I got one now.
Those wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop of the year!

1111
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,616
- I'm giving it to you.
- About the Andrews kid?

1112
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,703
I've got it written up.
All I want is a thousand bucks.

1113
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:53,121
A thousand bucks?
Get out...

1114
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:56,374
Don't get sore. This is something
you gotta do for me.

1115
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,794
- I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
- What's the thousand bucks for?

1116
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,921
- To tear down the walls of Jericho.
- What?

1117
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,425
Never mind. Andrews is going
to have her marriage annulled.

1118
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,093
- Huh?
- To marry somebody else.

1119
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,762
- You're drunk.
- Would that story be worth
a thousand bucks?

1120
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,474
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1121
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:17,896
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am, Joe.

1122
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,399
- You?
- Yeah.

1123
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,694
Now I know you're drunk.
I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1124
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,405
For heaven's sake,
stop being an editor for a minute.

1125
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:31,242
We've known each other a long time.
This is on the level.

1126
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:34,913
I met her on a bus from Miami.
I've been with her every minute.

1127
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:38,291
I'm in love with her.
You got to get me this money now.

1128
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:41,002
She's waiting for me
in an auto camp outside Philadelphia.

1129
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:43,755
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't know I'm gone.

1130
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:47,675
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1131
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,427
What a story.

1132
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:52,096
On her way to join her husband,
Ellen Andrews...

1133
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:53,890
That's it, that's it.

1134
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,435
Let me see that a minute.

1135
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,856
Zeke? Zeke!

1136
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,983
Zeke!

1137
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,444
I told you you couldn't trust him.

1138
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,446
- He's gone.
- Who?

1139
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:12,617
That fellow who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car too.

1140
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:16,329
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia. Get up.

1141
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:18,915
Don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1142
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,126
There ain't nothing
we can do if he's gone.

1143
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:39,769
- See that? They're gone.
- Looks like it, don't it?

1144
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,021
What's this?

1145
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,148
Ma, here's the woman.

1146
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,067
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

1147
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:48,486
- Where's your husband?
- "Husband"?

1148
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,613
Yes, if he is your husband.

1149
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,660
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone too.

1150
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,579
Oh.

1151
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:59,914
You got any money?

1152
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,708
- No.
- Then you'll have to git.

1153
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,960
Yeah, you'll have to git.

1154
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:09,299
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1155
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,676
You ain't gonna stick me
for no phone call.

1156
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:15,763
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter mile
down the road. They'll fix you up.

1157
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:20,184
And listen, next time
you better not come back here.

1158
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,604
I run a respectable place.

1159
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,526
- Thanks. You saved my life.
- So long, kid.

1160
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,653
- Good luck.
- Thanks. Good-bye, Agnes.

1161
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,865
Oh, you're beautiful!
All women are beautiful.

1162
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:37,201
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaperman in the business.

1163
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,538
- Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn!
- Hello?

1164
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,207
Hold up the morning edition.
Break down the front page.

1165
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,502
Complete new layout.
Send in a couple rewrite men.

1166
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:50,632
Hank, don't do a thing.
I've got a story
that will make your hair curl.

1167
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:52,884
Wait a minute.
Don't annoy me. I'm busy.

1168
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:57,347
- Agnes, send Mac in here!
Dig up all the pictures on that Andrews kid.
- Yes, sir.

1169
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:00,183
And Hank,
get Healy out of bed.

1170
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,727
I want a cartoon,
and I want it quick.

1171
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,063
King Westley's in it,
waiting at the church...

1172
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:06,981
with tears streaming
down his face.

1173
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,776
The bride didn't show up.
Old man Andrews is laughing.

1174
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,195
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it.

1175
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,280
Yeah, what is it?
Huh?

1176
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,743
Ellen Andrews?
You're crazy.

1177
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:22,997
No, I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp to come get her.

1178
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,667
He's getting a police escort,
and Westley's going along.

1179
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:27,835
Yeah, she's been
traveling by bus.

1180
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:31,214
The moment she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1181
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,925
Okay, grab a car
and stay with them.

1182
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,219
Get Hank again. Agnes!

1183
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,846
Get me a doctor.
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1184
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:42,100
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare. Agnes!

1185
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,519
Call the police.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1186
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:47,522
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched!

1187
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,941
- Do you want us?
- Everything off the front page!

1188
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:52,402
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.
She's going home.

1189
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:56,280
The minute she found out
the old man withdrew his objections,
she gave herself up.

1190
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,200
Spread it all over!
Play it up big! Here's your lead:

1191
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:03,246
- "Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it!
- Okay.

1192
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:19,512
Come on, baby.
Come on.

1193
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,765
We gotta get there
before she wakes up.

1194
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,736

1199
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,360

- Get 'em back.

1200

- How about a statement?

1202
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:27,163

We'll get it out of the way.

1208
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,371
Hiya!

1209
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:28,599
Hey, you darn fool!

1210
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:38,860
Hey!

1211
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,502
Hey, Pete, Ellen Andrews is going
to marry that Westley guy again.

1212
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:50,556
- Gordon's out back someplace.
- Yeah?

1213
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:54,352
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1214
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:59,565
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter Warne was just in.

1215
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,693
- What?
- He left this money.
Said to tell you he was kidding.

1216
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,278
- Where is he?
- There.

1217
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,238
Hey, Pete!

1218
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,159
Hello, Joe.

1219
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,080
Sorry. It was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1220
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,749
Yeah, sure.
You had me going for a while.

1221
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,919
- Wouldn't have made a bad story.
- No. Great.

1222
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:23,631
But that's the way things go.
You think you got a great yarn...

1223
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,884
and then something comes along
and messes up the finish...

1224
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,719
and there you are.

1225
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,764
Yeah. Where am I?

1226
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,730
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1227
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:42,566
Thanks.

1228
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,386
- Ellie?
- Oh, hello, Dad.

1229
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:13,222
I knocked several times.

1230
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,766
I'm sorry.
I must have been daydreaming.

1231
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,102
Well, everything's set.

1232
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,438
Creating quite a furor too.

1233
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:23,315
Great stunt
King is going to pull.

1234
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:27,069
- "Stunt"?
- Yes, landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1235
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,988
Oh. Oh, yes.

1236
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,615
Yes, I heard.

1237
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:34,535
Yes, personally,
I think it's silly too.

1238
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,704
You look lovely, child.

1239
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,831
Are you pleased
with the gown?

1240
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,960
- Ellie?
- Hmm?

1241
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,879
Oh, the gown.

1242
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,298
Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1243
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:54,680
What's the matter, child?

1244
01:29:57,476 --> 01:30:00,311
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1245
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:02,730
You haven't changed your mind
about King, have you?

1246
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:04,774
Oh, no, no.

1247
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:09,278
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1248
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,573
You gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1249
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:15,826
You know, the old pump
isn't what it used to be.

1250
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:18,996
I'm sorry, Father.
I wouldn't hurt you for anything.

1251
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:20,873
You know that.

1252
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,876
What's the matter, child?

1253
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:25,669
Aren't you happy?

1254
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,674
I thought so.

1255
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:33,469
I knew there was something
on your mind.

1256
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:37,139
There, there, there, now.

1257
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:41,852
What's the matter?

1258
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:45,523
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1259
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,527
Have you?

1260
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:55,658
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1261
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,702
This must be serious.

1262
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,373
Where'd you meet him?

1263
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:05,543
On the road.

1264
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,587
Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with a bus driver.

1265
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,714
Oh, no.

1266
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,178
Who is he?

1267
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,349
I don't know
very much about him...

1268
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,476
except that I love him.

1269
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:26,147
Well, if it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth...

1270
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:29,275
No, it's no use.
He despises me.

1271
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,569
- Oh, come, now!
- Yes, he does.

1272
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,280
He despises
everything about me.

1273
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,158
He says that
I'm spoiled and selfish...

1274
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:40,077
and pampered
and thoroughly insincere.

1275
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,371
Oh, ridiculous!

1276
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,790
He doesn't think
so much of you either.

1277
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,417
Well, I...

1278
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:49,378
He blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1279
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,089
He says
you raised me stupidly.

1280
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:55,384
That's a fine man
to fall in love with!

1281
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,428
Oh, he's marvelous.

1282
01:31:57,554 --> 01:32:00,014
Well, what are we going
to do about it?

1283
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,974
Where is he?

1284
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,643
- I don't know.
- I'd like to talk with him.

1285
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,896
It wouldn't do any good.

1286
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:09,899
I practically
threw myself at him.

1287
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:13,611
Under the circumstances,
don't you think we'd better
call this thing off?

1288
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,614
No, no.
No, I'll go through with it.

1289
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,825
But that's silly,
seeing the way you feel about him.

1290
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:23,245
No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1291
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,581
I've done it all my life.

1292
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:29,960
I've made your life miserable,
and mine too.

1293
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:32,588
I'm tired, Father.

1294
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:36,091
I'm tired of running around
in circles.

1295
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:39,762
He's right. That's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.

1296
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,307
I've got to settle down.

1297
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,644
It doesn't matter how
or where or with whom.

1298
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,856
You've changed, Ellie.

1299
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:53,317
I can't walk out on King now.

1300
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,819
It would make us all look
so ridiculous.

1301
01:32:57,155 --> 01:33:01,325
Anyway,
what difference does it make?

1302
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,577
I'll never see Peter again.

1303
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,121
Is that his name?

1304
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:08,791
Yes. Peter Warne.

1305
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:12,044
"Peter Warne."

1306
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:18,133
- Why? Do you know him?
- Why, no, no.

1307
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,678
Father, you haven't heard
from him, have you?

1308
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,888
- Don't be silly...
- Oh, please!

1309
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,640
What's that?

1310
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:40,406
Well, I guess that was
his only interest in me, wasn't it?

1311
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,074
The reward.

1312
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,994
- I'm sorry you read it.
- Are you going to see him?

1313
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,162
I suppose so.

1314
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:49,873
Certainly! Pay him off!

1315
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,543
He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1316
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:54,712
He kept me
thoroughly entertained.

1317
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:57,172
It's worth every penny he gets.

1318
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,508
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1319
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:02,219
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1320
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,346
Fine. Have him come in.

1321
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,563
I'll be going.

1322
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,276
Oh.

1323
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,077
If it isn't the bridegroom himself!
You're just in time, King.

1324
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,204
How are you, Ellie?

1325
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,040
- Are you happy?
- "Happy"?

1326
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,375
Why shouldn't I be happy?

1327
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,754
Here we are. Let's drink.
Well, it's up to you now.

1328
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,674
I want our life to be full of excitement.
We'll never let up, will we?

1329
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,551
Never a dull moment.

1330
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:45,262
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1331
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:48,557
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling.

1332
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,434
It's a promise.

1333
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,451
Hello. Yeah?

1334
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:10,496
Who? Oh.

1335
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,790
Why can't I see you
at your office?

1336
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:16,543
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1337
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,755
I thought perhaps
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1338
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:23,217
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1339
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:26,136
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1340
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:29,598
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1341
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:32,184
No, no, no.
Why do I want to...

1342
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:37,189
Hey, wait a minute.

1343
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,942
Maybe I will come over.
Yeah.

1344
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,070
I'd like to get a load
of that three-ring circus you're pulling.

1345
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:45,989
I want to see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1346
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:48,409
I haven't had
a good laugh in a week.

1347
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:53,163
- Mr. Warne?
- Yeah.

1348
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,585
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1349
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:02,339
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me...

1350
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:04,466
anything about you,
about your helping her.

1351
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,219
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1352
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:10,472
Why did she think I lugged her
all the way from Miami?

1353
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,392
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1354
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:16,353
She does, eh?
Isn't that sweet of her?

1355
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,481
- You don't, I suppose.
- Well, I don't know.

1356
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:22,276
I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1357
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:24,403
I presume you feel justified.

1358
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:27,865
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemized.

1359
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:33,620
"Cash outlay: $8.60.

1360
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:37,082
Topcoat: $15.
Suitcase: $7.50.

1361
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,544
Hat: $4.00.
Three shirts: $4.50.

1362
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:44,631
Total: $39.60.

1363
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:47,843
All the above items
had to be sold to buy gasoline."

1364
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:51,138
I sold some shorts and socks too.
I'm throwing those in.

1365
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:54,475
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter?
Isn't it cheap enough?

1366
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:57,603
Trip like that would cost you
a thousand dollars, maybe more.

1367
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:00,397
Let me get this straight.
You want 39.60...

1368
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,691
in addition to the $10,000?

1369
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,902
What 10,000?

1370
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:08,906
- The reward.
- Who said anything about a reward?

1371
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:11,700
I'm afraid
I'm a little bit confused.

1372
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:14,661
- I assumed that...
- Look, all I want is 39.60.

1373
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,873
If you give me a check,
I'll get out of this joint.

1374
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,958
It gives me the jitters.

1375
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:23,045
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1376
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,923
The average man
would go after the reward...

1377
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,592
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1378
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:31,553
This is a matter of principle, something
you probably wouldn't understand.

1379
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,099
When anybody takes me
for a buggy ride, I don't like
having to pay for the privilege.

1380
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,686
- Were you taken for a buggy ride?
- Yes, with all the trimmings.

1381
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:42,898
- So how about the check? Do I get it?
- Certainly.

1382
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,775
Thanks.

1383
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,290
There you are.

1384
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:02,251
Thank you.

1385
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:05,963
Do you mind if I ask you
a question, frankly?

1386
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:08,131
Do you love my daughter?

1387
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:13,095
Any guy in love with your daughter
oughta have his head examined.

1388
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,265
- That's an evasion.
- She picked a perfect running mate:

1389
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:18,475
King Westley,
the pill of the century.

1390
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:22,896
She needs a guy
that'd sock her once a day
whether it's coming to her or not.

1391
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:26,400
If you had half the brains
you're supposed to,
you'd have done it yourself.

1392
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:30,404
- Do you love her?
- A normal human being couldn't live
with her without going nutty!

1393
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:34,157
- She's my idea of nothing.
- I asked a simple question:
Do you love her?

1394
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:37,286
Yes! But don't hold that against me.
I'm a little screwy myself.

1395
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:43,959
Well, here's
to the merry-go-round.

1396
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:52,467
Perfect.
Now you look natural.

1397
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:00,726
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1398
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:03,729
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1399
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:06,857
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1400
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:09,192
I would, but I've got
a weak stomach.

1401
01:39:15,742 --> 01:39:18,702
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.

1402
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,623
- Just a minute, Ellie.
- I don't want to hear
another word about him.

1403
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,221
Come on, folks.
King Westley has arrived. Come on!

1404
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:34,277
There they come, boys.
Turn 'em over.

1405
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,517
You're a sucker
to go through with this.

1406
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:11,106
That guy Warne is okay.
He didn't want the reward.

1407
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:15,444
All he asked for was $39.60,
what he spent on you.

1408
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:19,740
Said it was a matter of principle.
You took him for a ride.

1409
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:30,000
He loves you, Ellie.
He told me so.

1410
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:35,130
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1411
01:41:35,256 --> 01:41:37,758
I can buy him off
for a pot of gold.

1412
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:44,139
And you can make
an old man happy...

1413
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:46,725
and you won't do
so bad for yourself.

1414
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,228
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1415
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:03,825
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here...

1416
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:06,995
in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

1417
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,998
to join together this man
and woman in holy matrimony.

1418
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:14,252
If any man can show just cause
why they may not lawfully
be joined together...

1419
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:19,090
let him now speak or else
hereafter forever hold his peace.

1420
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:24,221
King, wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife...

1421
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:27,682
- so long as ye both shall live?
- I will.

1422
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:32,646
Ellen, wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1423
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:34,773
so long as ye both shall live?

1424
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:41,071
- Ellen!
- Ellen! Ellen!

1425
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,739
Ellie!

1426
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:56,419
Where has she gone?

1427
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:15,814
- What happened?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

1428
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:33,206
Don't want to talk to...

1429
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,293
Don't want to talk to anybody.
Don't want to see anybody.

1430
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:38,461
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1431
01:43:38,588 --> 01:43:41,798
Oh! Ho-ho!

1432
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:45,468
Hello, my would-be
ex-son-in-law.

1433
01:43:45,595 --> 01:43:48,471
I've sent you a check
for a hundred thousand.

1434
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,182
That's the smartest thing
you ever did, Westley...

1435
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:53,435
not to contest that annulment.

1436
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:57,439
That's satisfactory, isn't it?
Well, it oughta be.

1437
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:00,650
I'm not complaining.
Oh, no. Not complaining.

1438
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,777
It was dirt cheap.

1439
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:05,322
Don't fall out of any windows!

1440
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:10,327
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1441
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:14,372
"What's holding up
the annulment, you slowpoke?

1442
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:17,417
The walls of Jericho
are toppling."

1443
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:21,171
Send him
a telegram right away.

1444
01:44:21,339 --> 01:44:24,049
Just say,
"Let 'em topple."

1445
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,929
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1446
01:44:29,055 --> 01:44:31,389
If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.

1447
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,892
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1448
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:36,853
They made me get 'em
a rope and a blanket.

1449
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:39,522
On a night like this!
What do you reckon that's for?

1450
01:44:39,649 --> 01:44:42,192
Blamed if I know.
I just brung 'em a trumpet.

1451
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:45,820
- A trumpet?
- One of them toy things.
They sent me to the store.

1452
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:48,573
What in the world
do they want a trumpet for?

1453
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:50,367
Don't know.
