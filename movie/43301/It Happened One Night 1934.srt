1
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,403
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

2
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:08,365
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.

3
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:10,598
-Sending meals up to her regularly?
-Yes, sir.

4
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,485
Why don't you jam it down her throat?

5
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,286
lt's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:17,997
l'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:19,682
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,362
l won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.

9
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:25,882
Come now, Ellie.
You know l'll have my way.

10
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:29,045
Not this time, you won't!
l'm already married to him.

11
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:31,358
You'll never live
under the same roof with him.

12
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:32,324
l'll see to it.

13
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:35,087
Get it through your head,
King Westley and l are married!

14
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:38,604
Definitely, legally, actually married!
lt's over, it's finished.

15
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:41,839
There's not a thing you can do about it.
l'm over 21 and so is he.

16
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:43,407
While you've been onboard...

17
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:46,321
...l've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.

18
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,605
Annulled. l'll have something to say
about that and so will King.

19
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,007
l expect him to.

20
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,958
The vittles. Come in.

21
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,437
l told you not to bring any food in here.

22
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:59,638
Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.

23
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:00,883
Put it down here.

24
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:11,643
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

25
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,322
Strategy, my dear.

26
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:16,047
Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away...

27
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:17,607
...from the Justice of the Peace?

28
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,724
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

29
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,446
l've won many arguments that way.

30
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:24,725
Besides not liking him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

31
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:27,841
-He's a fake.
-He's one of the best flyers in the country.

32
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:30,396
He's no good.
You married him because l said not to.

33
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,564
You're always telling me what not to do.

34
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,604
Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.

35
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,804
l come from a long line of stubborn idiots.

36
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,846
Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.

37
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,442
l'll shout if l want to!
l'll scream if l want to!

38
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,563
All right, scream.

39
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,958
Let me off this boat or l'll break
every piece of furniture in here!

40
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,561
Here, now.

41
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:51,560
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.

42
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,639
Just smell it. lt's a poem.

43
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:13,046
Lower the boats! Catch her!

44
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,327
Come on, men!

45
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:20,804
She got away, sir.

46
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,799
Of course, she's too smart for you.

47
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,802
Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.

48
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:26,923
''Daughter escaped again.

49
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,442
''Watch roads,
airports and train stations in Miami.''

50
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:35,044
All aboard!
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

51
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:37,843
...New York, Philadelphia.

52
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:40,840
We're wasting our time.
lmagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.

53
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,600
l told the old man it was bunk.

54
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,242
Ticket for New York, please.

55
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,367
-Here's your ticket.
-Thank you very much.

56
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,487
Thank you.

57
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,843
What's going on here?
l'd like to use that phone.

58
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:04,681
Go away. This is history in the making.

59
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:08,198
-What?
-There's a man biting a dog in there.

60
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,518
Heel, boy.

61
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,525
l can't stand this any longer.

62
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,566
ln a pig's eye, you will.

63
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:19,437
Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound...

64
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:22,036
...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.

65
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:25,285
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

66
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:29,077
l got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna write it in Greek?

67
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,442
l'd start a new department.

68
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,758
That was free verse,
you gas house palooka.

69
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:35,880
What was free about it?
lt cost this paper a gob of dough.

70
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,686
And it's not going to cost us any more!

71
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:38,758
Gordon.

72
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,566
Did you know he reversed the charge?

73
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,400
What? Why you....

74
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:47,440
When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.

75
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:51,521
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.

76
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:54,247
What'd he say?

77
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,360
So, you're changing your tune?

78
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:02,921
You're late with your apologies.

79
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:06,603
l wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!

80
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:08,525
l hope this'll be a lesson to you.

81
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,247
Did we tell that baby?

82
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:16,156
-We don't need anymore of his lip.
-You told him, Pete.

83
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:18,364
l guess he knows now,
how l feel about his job.

84
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,006
l bet he does, too.

85
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,680
ls my chariot ready?

86
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:24,760
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth,
mighty King.

87
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:29,002
-Lead on, sire.
-Make way for the king.

88
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,880
Make way for the king.

89
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,686
Long live the king.

90
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,479
Philadelphia, all aboard!

91
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,327
Step down Marty, King is back.

92
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:47,717
On the rack in the back.
lt's your goodbye chariot.

93
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,436
Make hams of you and scram!

94
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:54,240
Two thousand miles is a long trip.

95
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,648
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

96
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:58,957
Pillow, sir?

97
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:11,326
Driver! lf you'll be good enough
to move those newspapers, l'll have a seat.

98
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,365
Hey, wait a minute!

99
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:27,040
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,167
The papers. What's the idea of
throwing them out?

101
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:33,240
The papers? lt's a long story, my friend.

102
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:35,717
l never did like the idea
of sitting on newspapers.

103
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:39,357
l did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.

104
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:42,565
lt actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

105
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:46,323
They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.

106
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:49,764
A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.

107
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:56,363
Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but l do.

108
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,764
l always wear it out in the open so...

109
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:01,408
...if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.

110
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:03,567
Yeah?

111
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:08,440
Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't l think of it?

112
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,042
Our conversation could have been over
long ago.

113
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,283
Yeah?

114
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:14,923
lf you keep that up,
we won't get anywhere.

115
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:16,643
Yeah?

116
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:20,238
You got me. Yeah!

117
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:32,522
Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.

118
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:35,321
l beg your pardon?

119
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,876
Now listen,
l put up a stiff fight for that seat.

120
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:40,802
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.

121
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:44,243
Driver, are these seats reserved?

122
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:47,718
-No. First come, first serve.
-Thank you.

123
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:51,160
These seats accommodate two people,
don't they?

124
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,000
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

125
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:54,117
Thank you.

126
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,281
Move over.

127
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,037
This is a ''maybe they do.''

128
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:12,841
lf you'd ask me real nice,
l might put that bag up there for you.

129
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:33,001
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.

130
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:54,518
Get some! Come on, everybody!

131
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:56,766
Hot dogs, folks!

132
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:03,243
Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.

133
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,647
Red hot coffee!

134
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:07,081
Right around there.

135
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:09,124
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!

136
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,120
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!

137
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:53,637
He got away.

138
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,886
l found myself in the middle of brush
and no sign of the skunk.

139
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:59,243
l don't know what you're raving about,
young man.

140
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:02,877
-Furthermore, l'm not interested.
-Well of all the....

141
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:06,560
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.

142
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:08,685
My heavens! lt's gone!

143
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,281
l knew you'd catch on eventually.

144
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:15,120
-What am l going to do now?
-Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

145
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:19,645
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All l have here is $4.

146
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,764
You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.

147
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:22,917
No, l can't.

148
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:26,685
-Yes, l guess l will.
-l'll tell the driver about your bag.

149
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,599
Thank you, l'd rather you didn't.

150
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:31,998
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.

151
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,602
-What's your name?
-l don't want it reported!

152
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:36,997
That's silly.
The company will take care of it.

153
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:41,047
Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?

154
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:43,084
l want to be left alone.

155
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:48,604
Why, you ungrateful brat.

156
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:50,556
Board!

157
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,361
All aboard!

158
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,436
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.

159
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,485
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.

160
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:38,117
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

161
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,527
Read all about it!

162
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:07,405
l'm so sorry.

163
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,960
Silly, isn't it?

164
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:12,765
Why, everybody's gone!

165
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,365
Thank you for that, very much.

166
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:23,001
-We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
-Yes.

167
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,120
That was foolish of me.

168
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:30,482
Why didn't you shove me away?

169
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:34,598
l hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.

170
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,481
How about some breakfast?

171
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:42,366
No thank you. No, l'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

172
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:46,523
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.

173
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:48,565
No, they'll wait for me.

174
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,883
Driver, l'm going to be a few minutes late.
Be sure to wait for me.

175
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,123
Yeah?

176
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:57,837
Yes.

177
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:20,926
Where's the bus to New York?

178
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:22,606
lt left about 20 minutes ago.

179
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:26,802
But that's ridiculous. l was on that bus.
l told them to wait.

180
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,443
l'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

181
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:33,880
Good morning. Remember me?
l'm the fellow you slept on last night.

182
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:38,163
Seems to me,
l've already thanked you for that.

183
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:39,642
What time's the next bus?

184
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,161
8:00 tonight.

185
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,126
8:00? That's 12 hours.

186
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:45,767
Sorry, miss.

187
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:49,608
What's wrong?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

188
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,044
Why are you so excited?
You missed it, too.

189
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:53,766
Yeah, l missed it too.

190
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:57,681
Don't tell me you did it on my account.

191
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:02,123
l hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is....

192
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:05,117
Young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

193
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,766
l can take care of myself.

194
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:10,563
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here's your ticket.

195
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,362
My ticket?

196
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,399
l found it on the seat.

197
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:21,239
Thank you.
lt must have fallen out of my purse.

198
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,166
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

199
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:30,120
-What are you talking about?
-You won't get away with it.

200
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,678
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

201
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,404
You must have me confused
with someone else.

202
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:38,683
Quit kidding. lt's all over the front page.

203
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:46,246
l've always been curious to know...

204
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:50,287
...what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.

205
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:54,680
Take my advice. Grab the next bus back
to Miami. That guy's a phoney.

206
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,163
l didn't ask for your advice.

207
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:00,884
That's right. You didn't.

208
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,238
You're not going to notify my father,
are you?

209
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:05,602
What for?

210
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,563
You probably could get
some money out of him.

211
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:09,962
l never thought of that.

212
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:13,563
lf you promise not to do it,
l'll pay you as much as he will.

213
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,406
You won't gain a thing by giving me up.

214
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,524
l'm willing to make it worth your while.

215
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,883
l've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

216
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,800
lt's very important to me.

217
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,560
l'd pay you now, only...

218
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:26,082
...all l had when l jumped off
the yacht was a watch.

219
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,159
l had to pawn it to get these clothes.

220
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:31,081
l'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.

221
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:32,522
Never mind.

222
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,044
l had you pegged right from the jump.

223
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,126
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.

224
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:44,161
You're in a jam and all you can think of is
your money. lt never fails, does it?

225
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,525
Ever hear of the word ''humility''?

226
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,041
No, you wouldn't.

227
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,846
lt never occurred to you to say...

228
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:52,647
...''Please, Mister, l'm in trouble.
Will you help me?''

229
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:55,196
That'd bring you down off your high horse.

230
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:57,597
l'll tell you something to ease your mind.

231
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,201
You don't have to worry about me.

232
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:01,837
l'm not interested in your money
or your problem.

233
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:05,887
You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.

234
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:13,126
You send telegrams here?

235
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:16,401
l'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?

236
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:23,279
''To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

237
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:27,281
''Am l laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.

238
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:30,799
''l know where Ellen Andrews is.''
No, do you really?

239
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:33,798
Go on. Send the telegram.

240
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,762
''How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of....''

241
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:39,961
Mush.

242
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:42,198
''Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.

243
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:45,758
''What l said about never writing
another line for you still goes.

244
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,759
''Are you burning? Peter Warne.''

245
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:49,600
That'll be $2.60.

246
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,724
-Send it collect.
-Collect?

247
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,036
Collect.

248
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:03,322
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...

249
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:07,526
...Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York....

250
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:38,281
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.

251
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,643
Gets tiresome.
Especially for somebody like you.

252
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,400
You look like you've got class.

253
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:47,039
Yes, with a capital ''K''. l'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.

254
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:50,564
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.

255
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:52,445
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.

256
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:55,726
Shapeley's the name
and that's the way l like them.

257
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,600
You made no mistake sitting next to me.

258
00:18:57,688 --> 00:18:59,360
Most girls you meet on the bus...

259
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,678
...ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.

260
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,566
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

261
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:06,957
You can't be too particular, neither.

262
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,323
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?

263
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:13,162
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

264
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:18,563
That's pretty good. ''Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance.''

265
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,963
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.

266
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:23,840
Looks like you're one up on me.

267
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,886
There's nothing l like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

268
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:31,007
...that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.

269
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,567
That's what l always say.

270
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,367
Yes, sir.

271
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:38,361
When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.

272
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:42,478
Now you're just my type.

273
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:45,640
Believe me, sister,
l could go for you in a big way.

274
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:50,722
''Fun-on-the-side Shapeley,'' they call me.
With accent on the ''fun''. Believe you me.

275
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:54,080
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

276
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:58,716
Looks like you're two up on me now.

277
00:19:59,048 --> 00:19:59,958
Hey, you.

278
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:04,720
-There's a seat over there for you.
-What's the idea?

279
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:08,204
l'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

280
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,722
-Your wife?
-Yes.

281
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:11,597
Come on.

282
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,803
Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, l was just....

283
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:19,358
Sure. Excuse me, miss.
l was just trying to make things pleasant.

284
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:20,917
Excuse me, l....

285
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:23,397
l didn't mean anything, Doc.

286
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,521
-No offence, Doc.
-No.

287
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:36,398
lf you promise not to snap my head off,
l'd like to thank you.

288
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:40,521
Forget it. l didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.

289
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:48,639
What'd you do all day?

290
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:53,163
Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.

291
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,759
Your clothes are all wet.

292
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:00,802
Here.

293
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,644
You're as helpless as a baby.

294
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:04,797
Thank you.

295
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:09,678
Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

296
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,167
Here, boy.

297
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,603
-Yes, ma'am.
-A box of chocolates, please.

298
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:18,156
-Never mind. She doesn't want it.
-But....

299
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,762
-Of course, l do. What do you mean?
-Beat it.

300
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:23,807
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!

301
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:27,446
$1 .60.

302
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,086
You had $4 last night.

303
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:32,839
How will you get to New York at this rate?

304
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,283
That's none of your business.

305
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:37,923
You're on a budget from now on.

306
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:41,320
-Just a minute. You can't--
-Shut up.

307
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,082
-What's the matter, officer?
-Bridge washed out.

308
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:07,398
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

309
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,758
lf any passengers want a place to sleep...

310
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:12,123
...you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

311
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,483
-Where?
-Right over there. See those lights?

312
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:16,876
Dyke's Auto camp.

313
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:19,158
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

314
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:21,201
Are you talking to me?

315
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:23,796
Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.

316
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,881
Hey! Come on, we're all set.

317
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:56,323
Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.

318
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:07,565
Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?

319
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,680
Darn clever, these Armenians?

320
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:31,600
Yeah, it's a gift.

321
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:38,728
l just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.

322
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:42,881
Yeah. l forgot to tell you about that.
l registered as Mr. and Mrs.

323
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,242
You did?

324
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:48,640
What am l expected to do? Leap for joy?

325
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,522
l kind of half expected you to thank me.

326
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:55,087
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

327
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:57,762
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?

328
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:08,236
You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.

329
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:13,124
Just whatever gave you any idea
l'd stand for this?

330
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:17,083
Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.

331
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:20,724
lf you're nursing any silly notion
that l'm interested in you, forget it.

332
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:23,003
You're just a headline to me.

333
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,847
A headline?

334
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:27,799
You're not a newspaper man, are you?

335
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:29,959
Chalk up one for your side.

336
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:34,119
Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?

337
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:37,843
All right, l'm here to help you.
What l want is your story.

338
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:42,844
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.

339
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:46,924
l need that story.
Between you and me, l've got to have it.

340
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:53,001
lsn't that just too cute.

341
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:56,885
There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?

342
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:02,039
You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. lncluding this.

343
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,120
This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.

344
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:09,360
These cabins cost $2 a night.
l'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...

345
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:13,367
...but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.

346
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:22,961
Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.

347
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:25,637
lt's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.

348
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,605
But l'm going to follow you.

349
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:28,677
Yeah.

350
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:33,763
And if you get tough, l'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.

351
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:37,238
Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.

352
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,398
A simple story for simple people.

353
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:44,082
You behave yourself,
l'll see you get to King Westley.

354
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,160
lf not,
l'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.

355
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,200
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?

356
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:54,239
This one? All right.

357
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,645
That, l suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

358
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,277
This?

359
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,798
l like privacy when l retire.
Yes, l'm very delicate in that respect.

360
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,446
Prying eyes annoy me.

361
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:35,566
Behold the walls of Jericho.

362
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,644
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.

363
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,167
But a lot safer.

364
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:43,921
You see, l have no trumpet.

365
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:47,322
Now to show you
my heart's in the right place...

366
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:49,876
...l'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.

367
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,038
Do you mind joining the lsraelites?

368
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,004
You don't want to join the lsraelites?

369
00:26:57,088 --> 00:27:00,637
All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

370
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:04,880
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

371
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:06,765
No two men do it alike.

372
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:10,483
l once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

373
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:12,486
Now he made a picture.

374
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:15,964
Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.

375
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:19,725
l have a method all my own.

376
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:23,841
lf you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.

377
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:28,322
Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.

378
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:30,680
There's where l'm different.

379
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:32,605
l go for the shoes next.

380
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:35,402
First the right. Then the left.

381
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:40,727
After that, it's every man for himself.

382
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,526
Still with me, brat?

383
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,399
Don't be a sucker.

384
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:13,277
A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.

385
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:15,518
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.

386
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:19,442
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

387
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:37,122
''Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?.
The big bad wolf

388
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:38,562
''The big bad wolf

389
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:43,717
''She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la''

390
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:48,963
Would you mind please,
putting out the light?

391
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,527
No, not at all.

392
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:32,041
l wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

393
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,766
Excuse me.

394
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,960
By the way, what's your name?

395
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:03,602
What's that?

396
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,485
Who are you?

397
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:07,727
Who, me?

398
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:11,567
l'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.

399
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:15,843
l'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

400
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,604
You've got a name, haven't you?

401
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:21,677
Yeah, l got a name. Peter Warne.

402
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:24,120
Peter Warne.

403
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,760
l don't like it.

404
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:30,807
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

405
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:34,799
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

406
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:37,722
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

407
00:30:57,528 --> 00:31:00,281
-Another message, sir.
-What is it? What is it?

408
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:03,166
lt's from Charleston.
''Checking every northbound train.

409
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:05,677
''Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.

410
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:08,487
''No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.

411
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:10,399
''Signed, Lovington Detective Agency.''

412
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:12,724
lt's just the same as all the others.

413
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,007
-Yes, sir?
-l said l was in a hurry to get to New York.

414
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:18,318
-What are we crawling for?
-l got it wide open.

415
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:20,478
-All right, step on it.
-Yes, sir.

416
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:22,206
l hope she's all right.

417
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:26,162
All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?

418
00:31:26,728 --> 00:31:29,242
-Nothing, sir.
-Then shut up about it.

419
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:54,007
Hello?

420
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,721
Hey, mister.

421
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:03,007
Hello.

422
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:05,199
What's the matter, you not up yet?

423
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:07,876
-What time is it?
-8:00. Here.

424
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,044
lt's a toothbrush, thanks.

425
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:15,156
My dress, you had it pressed.

426
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:17,764
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

427
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:20,038
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

428
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:22,801
l'll count to 10.
lf you're not out of bed by then...

429
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:24,526
...l'll drag you out myself.

430
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:27,725
-One, two, three, four, five....
-l really think you would!

431
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:30,481
l'm out! l'm out!

432
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,007
You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.

433
00:32:36,008 --> 00:32:37,236
Outside?

434
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:39,798
All the best homes have them outside.

435
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:44,724
l can't go out like this.

436
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,608
-Like what?
-Like this. l have no robe.

437
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,326
Here, use mine.

438
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,762
Thanks.

439
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,003
Make it snappy.

440
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:55,397
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.

441
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:58,367
-Here are my puppets.
-Thanks.

442
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,327
Where'd you say the showers were?

443
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:04,636
Here's a towel.

444
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,242
Thank you.

445
00:33:08,928 --> 00:33:10,998
You're kind of little, aren't you?

446
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:12,397
Where's the shower?

447
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:15,048
Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.

448
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:16,920
l'll find it myself.

449
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:50,080
Are the showers in there?

450
00:33:50,168 --> 00:33:51,886
They ain't out here.

451
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:53,482
Thank you.

452
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,558
Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?

453
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:08,038
You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

454
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:20,527
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?

455
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,520
Say, l'm sorry about last night.

456
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:26,044
Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.

457
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,080
High time you got back.

458
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,636
l met some very interesting women
at the showers.

459
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:43,124
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

460
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:47,799
Come on. Sit down.

461
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:52,080
My, my. Scrambled eggs.

462
00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:57,563
Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

463
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,083
Any complaints?

464
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,567
No. No complaints.

465
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:03,879
l'd have cream for your coffee,
but l'd be buying a whole pint.

466
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:05,805
You don't have to apologise to me.

467
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:08,083
You don't know how much
l appreciate all this.

468
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,961
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

469
00:35:11,368 --> 00:35:12,483
Must be the spring.

470
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,719
l thought maybe ''believe you me''
told you some more snappy stories.

471
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:19,960
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.

472
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:23,040
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.

473
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,686
-Donut?
-Thanks.

474
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:31,124
You think this whole business is silly?

475
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,561
Running away and all.

476
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,286
No. Makes too good a story.

477
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:37,804
Yes, you do.
You think l'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

478
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:40,442
Perhaps l am.
Although, l don't see how l can be.

479
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:42,758
Spoiled people are used to
having their way.

480
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,486
l never have. On the contrary.

481
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:48,527
l've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.

482
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:52,804
Can you believe, this is the first time
l've ever been alone with a man?

483
00:35:52,928 --> 00:35:53,997
Yeah.

484
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:56,158
lt's a wonder l'm not panic-stricken.

485
00:35:56,248 --> 00:35:58,045
You're doing all right.

486
00:35:58,248 --> 00:35:59,237
Thanks.

487
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:06,804
Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. lt's been a lot of fun.

488
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:09,197
One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.

489
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:14,359
lt has its moments. lt's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.

490
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:18,243
l did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

491
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:21,042
lt was swell. l felt absolutely immoral.

492
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:24,040
lt didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.

493
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:28,087
l was so mad, l ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car l saw.

494
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,516
Guess who was in it?

495
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:30,882
Santa Claus?

496
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,197
Ghandi?

497
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:34,199
King Westley was in it.

498
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:37,285
-ls that how you met him?
-Yes.

499
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,401
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

500
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:43,480
By 6:00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.

501
00:36:45,488 --> 00:36:48,207
Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?

502
00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:50,677
Now don't you start telling me
l shouldn't dunk.

503
00:36:50,768 --> 00:36:53,043
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.

504
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:57,485
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.

505
00:36:57,568 --> 00:37:00,207
You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.

506
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,724
lt's all a matter of timing.
l'll write a book about it.

507
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:05,036
Thanks, professor.

508
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:08,717
Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.

509
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:11,886
l'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.

510
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,324
How do l know who you are?
l never saw you before.

511
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,840
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.

512
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:22,158
How do l know you're detectives?

513
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:24,239
Show him your credentials, Mac.

514
00:37:26,888 --> 00:37:27,798
Detectives.

515
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:31,800
That's father at work. Peter, what'll l do?

516
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:34,527
Maybe l can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.

517
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:36,041
Get yourself all mussed up.

518
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,801
Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.

519
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:42,396
l got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.

520
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:45,844
She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.

521
00:37:45,928 --> 00:37:47,486
What are you talking about?

522
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:51,000
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

523
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:55,117
She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

524
00:37:58,328 --> 00:37:59,443
Come in.

525
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:02,167
l hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?

526
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:06,127
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

527
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,640
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

528
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:10,446
Who, me? You wanna see me?

529
00:38:10,528 --> 00:38:11,847
What's your name?

530
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,240
-Are you addressing me?
-Yeah. What's your name?

531
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:18,246
Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.

532
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,997
What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?

533
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:24,285
-We're looking for somebody.
-Fine, but don't come busting in here.

534
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,403
This isn't a public park.

535
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:27,206
l got news to take a sock at you.

536
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,284
-Take it easy.
-The men are detectives.

537
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:31,438
Even if they're the
whole police department...

538
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:33,678
...they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.

539
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:36,407
Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.

540
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:41,084
ls that so? How many times
have l told you not to butt in?

541
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:44,205
You don't have to lose your temper!

542
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,404
As usual. Every time l try to protect you.

543
00:38:46,488 --> 00:38:49,446
At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.

544
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,723
He did not! l told you a million times.

545
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:54,447
He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.

546
00:38:54,528 --> 00:38:56,086
He didn't. You were drunk.

547
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,886
Nuts! Just like your old man.

548
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,562
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

549
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:02,684
There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.

550
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:04,486
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!

551
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,520
-Shut up!
-You see what you've done?

552
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:11,277
Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.

553
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:13,438
We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.

554
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,399
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.

555
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,877
Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.

556
00:39:17,968 --> 00:39:19,401
Quit bawling!

557
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,164
l told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.

558
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:38,244
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.

559
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:40,922
-You've got a brain.
-You're not so bad, yourself.

560
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,839
We could start a two-people
stock company.

561
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:45,567
Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.

562
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:47,843
We'll call this one, ''The Great Deception.''

563
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,237
What about ''Cinderella'' or
a real hot love story?

564
00:39:50,328 --> 00:39:51,443
No, too mushy.

565
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:53,246
l like mushy stuff.

566
00:39:53,968 --> 00:39:55,401
Quit bawling!

567
00:39:56,248 --> 00:39:57,761
Bus leaves in five minutes!

568
00:39:57,888 --> 00:40:00,038
-What?
-Your bus leaves in five minutes.

569
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:02,767
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.

570
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:09,836
l'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.

571
00:40:09,928 --> 00:40:11,156
This is the last session....

572
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:13,086
-Yeah?
-Telegram for you.

573
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,523
-Bring it in.
-Another wire from Peter Warne.

574
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:20,160
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?

575
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:24,564
''Have l got a story. Stop.
lt's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.

576
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:26,645
''Hope you're the same.''

577
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:29,767
-Collect?
-Yes.

578
00:40:29,848 --> 00:40:32,442
-lf you accept another one, you're fired.
-Yes, sir.

579
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:34,758
And that gives me an idea for all of you.

580
00:40:35,248 --> 00:40:37,000
l want action, Lovington, action.

581
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,886
-We can't do the impossible.
-lt isn't impossible.

582
00:40:39,968 --> 00:40:42,641
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
l want her found.

583
00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:45,328
-l put extra men on, the whole way.
-That's not enough.

584
00:40:45,408 --> 00:40:46,682
Send in Clark and Brown.

585
00:40:46,768 --> 00:40:49,123
-You sure she isn't with King Westley?
-No.

586
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:51,921
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.

587
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:54,482
He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.

588
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:57,560
l'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.

589
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:58,683
l don't think so.

590
00:40:58,768 --> 00:41:00,759
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.

591
00:41:00,848 --> 00:41:03,043
Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of...

592
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,358
...$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.

593
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:08,237
Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.

594
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,928
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

595
00:41:11,008 --> 00:41:14,239
Wire this to them.
l want the story to break right away.

596
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:16,327
Now we'll get some action!

597
00:41:50,728 --> 00:41:52,161
Fine, that's fine.

598
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:57,446
You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?

599
00:41:58,088 --> 00:41:59,487
Yeah.

600
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:08,316
''Once l was happy
but now l'm forlorn

601
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:11,918
''Like an old coat
that is tattered and torn

602
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:15,765
''Left in this wide world

603
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:19,725
''Betrayed by a maid in her teens

604
00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:23,080
''This maid that l loved

605
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:27,443
''And l tried all l knew how to please

606
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:31,238
''But l never could please her
one-quarter so well

607
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:35,241
''As the man on the flying trapeze

608
00:42:35,368 --> 00:42:38,917

''And my love he has stolen away''

612
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:58,638
l know the second verse there.

613
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,277
''Now he'd play with a miss

00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:15,398
''Perhaps he is better described as a louse
And still people came just the same

616
00:43:15,608 --> 00:43:19,283
''Now he smiles from the bar
on the people below

617
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:22,440
''And one night he smiled on my love

618
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:24,920
''She blew him a kiss

619
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:30,959
''And she hollered bravo
And he hung by his schnozzle from above

620
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:34,484
''He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

621
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:39,962
''Daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful

622
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:45,964
''All the girls he does please
And my love he has stolen away''

623
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:50,478
Do you mind if l take the third one?

624
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:59,118
''l wept and l whimpered
l simpered for weeks

625
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:02,758
''While she spent her time
with the circus' freaks

626
00:44:02,968 --> 00:44:06,643
''The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

627
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:09,760
''Alas, Alack and Alaska

628
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:13,644
''l went to this fellow
the villain, and l said

629
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:17,078
''l'll see that you get your deserts

630
00:44:17,248 --> 00:44:20,604
''His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer

631
00:44:20,888 --> 00:44:24,358
''He sneered once again and said no

632
00:44:24,488 --> 00:44:27,878
''He flies through the air

633
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:30,966
''That daring young man

''My love he has stolen away''

636
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:48,960
-Everybody keep your seats.
-Thank the man for me, Peter.

637
00:44:49,048 --> 00:44:52,358
lt's the first comfortable position
l've been in all night.

638
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:56,478
''She flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

''The daring young--''

640
00:44:59,688 --> 00:45:02,327
What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.

641
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,966
Something happened to her.

642
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:05,640
Look how pale she is.

643
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:15,639
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.

644
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:17,958
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

645
00:45:19,808 --> 00:45:22,402
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

646
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,119
What happened to your money?

647
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:30,486
Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.

648
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:33,558
We shouldn't have come, l guess.

649
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:37,160
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

650
00:45:37,248 --> 00:45:39,716
...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.

651
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:47,922
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

652
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:51,763
The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.

653
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:55,285
l shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.

654
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:58,366
Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.

655
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:00,325
No, but you might need it.

656
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:01,284
Come on.

657
00:46:01,368 --> 00:46:02,403
l got millions.

658
00:46:02,488 --> 00:46:03,284
Here.

659
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:05,478
-Thanks.
-Come on, go back.

660
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:23,926
Better phone for some help.

661
00:46:24,008 --> 00:46:26,920
Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.

662
00:46:27,048 --> 00:46:28,163
Yeah?

663
00:46:28,408 --> 00:46:31,684
Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?

664
00:46:33,088 --> 00:46:36,637
Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

665
00:46:36,808 --> 00:46:38,958
Take that story there, for instance.

666
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:42,717
lf l was to see that dame,
you know what l'd do?

667
00:46:42,848 --> 00:46:43,883
No.

668
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:46,044
l'd go fifty-fifty with you.

669
00:46:46,528 --> 00:46:47,324
Why?

670
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:49,126
Because l don't believe in hogging.

671
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:52,359
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

672
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:54,120
That's what l always say.

673
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:58,686
What's on your mind?

674
00:46:58,848 --> 00:47:01,043
Five G's or l crab the works.

675
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:09,801
Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.

676
00:47:09,888 --> 00:47:12,322
l knew she wasn't your wife all the time.

677
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:19,247
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man l need.

678
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:22,479
-You made no mistake, believe me.
-l can use a smart guy like you.

679
00:47:22,568 --> 00:47:26,004
-When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
-Can you make a gat?

680
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:27,244
Huh?

681
00:47:27,648 --> 00:47:29,639
A gat. A rod.

682
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,079
-Got any fireworks on you?
-No.

683
00:47:33,288 --> 00:47:37,167
l got a couple of machine guns
in my suitcase. l'll give you one of them.

684
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:40,240
May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.

685
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:43,638
lf you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.

686
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,923
l'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.

687
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:46,998
Killer?

688
00:47:47,128 --> 00:47:49,722
Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.

689
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,238
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

690
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:55,963
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

691
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:58,687
$10, 000? Chicken feed.

692
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:02,444
Now listen, we're holding that dame
for a million smackers.

693
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:06,203
Say, l didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, l've got....

694
00:48:06,568 --> 00:48:08,877
What's the matter? You getting yellow?

695
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:12,278
l'm a married man. l got a couple of kids.
l can't afford to get....

696
00:48:12,448 --> 00:48:14,678
Pipe down your mug before l....

697
00:48:15,248 --> 00:48:17,887
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

698
00:48:17,968 --> 00:48:21,040
Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?

699
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:22,607
You know too much.

700
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:24,519
l won't say anything, honest l won't.

701
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,486
How do l know that?
l got a notion to plug you.

702
00:48:27,728 --> 00:48:31,641
-Why should l take a chance with you?
-Trust me, mister. l'll keep my mouth shut.

703
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:32,683
Yeah?

704
00:48:34,648 --> 00:48:36,127
What's your name?

705
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:37,727
Oscar Shapeley.

706
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:40,283
-Where do you live?
-Orange, New Jersey.

707
00:48:40,728 --> 00:48:42,320
Got a couple of kids?

708
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:45,719
Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.

709
00:48:45,808 --> 00:48:48,368
-You love them, don't you?
-Yes, l do.

710
00:48:48,528 --> 00:48:50,325
You wouldn't. You're not thinking of--

711
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:52,842
-You keep your trap shut, all right?
-Sure.

712
00:48:53,128 --> 00:48:55,596
-lf you don't....
-l'll keep my trap shut. l will.

713
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:57,565
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

714
00:48:58,048 --> 00:48:59,401
Bugs Dooley? No.

715
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:02,878
He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.

716
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:04,487
Got a little too talkative.

717
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:06,286
-You know what happened to his kid?
-No.

718
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:09,758
l can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.

719
00:49:10,128 --> 00:49:11,561
That's terrible.

720
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:15,086
He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. l never talk.

721
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,518
l never say a word. Word of honour.

722
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:20,196
l wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

723
00:49:20,288 --> 00:49:22,518
Okay. Just remember that.

724
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:24,683
Now beat it.

725
00:49:24,848 --> 00:49:28,761
Sure, mister. Thanks.
l always knew you guys were--

726
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:31,602
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

727
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:33,844
Sure. Anything you say.

728
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:37,120
-You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
-lf you don't beat it....

729
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,402
l'm going.

730
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:54,764
What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?

731
00:49:54,848 --> 00:49:56,679
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

732
00:49:56,808 --> 00:49:58,287
Why?

733
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:07,600
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.

734
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:11,727
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

735
00:50:12,448 --> 00:50:14,678
Why did we have to leave the bus?

736
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,318
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

737
00:50:20,128 --> 00:50:22,164
l've been doing a little thinking myself.

738
00:50:22,968 --> 00:50:25,721
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

739
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:27,719
What's the matter, are you weakening?

740
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:32,484
No. l was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.

741
00:50:32,648 --> 00:50:34,764
Did you give that child all your money?

742
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:37,408
l gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.

743
00:50:37,488 --> 00:50:39,683
All the money l had was that ten spot.

744
00:50:39,808 --> 00:50:42,561
So l've been thinking
you better wire your father.

745
00:50:42,848 --> 00:50:46,966
No, sir. l started out for New York
and l'm going to get there...

746
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:49,357
...if l have to starve all the way.

747
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:50,484
Okay.

748
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,918
What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?

749
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:56,487
Here, take these.

750
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:59,761
-Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
-That?

751
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,406
Get up on the log.

752
00:51:11,648 --> 00:51:13,525
l wish you'd stop being playful.

753
00:51:13,648 --> 00:51:18,438
So sorry. You know, this is the first time
in years l've ridden piggyback.

754
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:20,327
This isn't piggyback.

755
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:22,478
-Of course it is.
-You're crazy.

756
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:26,837
l remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

757
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:28,805
-And he carried you like this?
-Yes.

758
00:51:28,888 --> 00:51:31,766
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

759
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:36,081
My uncle has four children.
l've seen them ride piggyback.

760
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:38,887
l'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

761
00:51:38,968 --> 00:51:41,721
l never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.

762
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:44,360
You're prejudiced.

763
00:51:45,328 --> 00:51:47,888
Show me a good piggy backer.
l'll show you a real human.

764
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:51,040
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.

765
00:51:51,128 --> 00:51:54,518
Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

766
00:51:56,128 --> 00:51:58,596
My father was a great piggy backer.

767
00:51:59,968 --> 00:52:01,640
Here, hold this a minute.

768
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:06,687
Thank you.

769
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:14,804
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

770
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:30,159
This looks like the best spot.

771
00:52:30,608 --> 00:52:33,076
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

772
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:36,638
l don't know about you,
but l'm going to give a good imitation of it.

773
00:52:36,768 --> 00:52:37,803
Peter?

774
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:39,163
What?

775
00:52:39,768 --> 00:52:41,486
l'm awfully hungry.

776
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:43,161
lt's just your imagination.

777
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:44,687
No it isn't.

778
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:47,681
l'm hungry and scared.

779
00:52:48,008 --> 00:52:50,568
You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.

780
00:52:50,648 --> 00:52:51,967
Well, l am.

781
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:54,323
lf you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.

782
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:56,683
Not if you're more hungry than scared.

783
00:52:56,888 --> 00:52:59,686
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.

784
00:53:02,008 --> 00:53:04,397
l can't forget it. l'm still hungry.

785
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:08,637
Holy smoke!
Why did l ever get mixed up with you?

786
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,367
lf l had any sense,
l'd be in New York by this time.

787
00:53:12,848 --> 00:53:14,486
What about your story?

788
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:17,207
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

789
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,366
l turned out to be the prize sucker.

790
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:27,202
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.

791
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,358
l'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

792
00:53:30,448 --> 00:53:31,961
-Then take them off.
-What?

793
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:36,121
All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.

794
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:08,121
You're becoming awfully
disagreeable lately.

795
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:11,639
You just snap my head off
every time l open my mouth.

796
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:17,685
lf being with me is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.

797
00:54:19,568 --> 00:54:21,684
You can leave any time you see fit.

798
00:54:22,768 --> 00:54:24,804
Nobody's holding you here.

799
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:27,925
l can get along.

800
00:54:33,408 --> 00:54:34,636
Peter?

801
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,357
Peter!

802
00:54:46,808 --> 00:54:48,844
-What's the matter?
-l was so scared!

803
00:54:48,928 --> 00:54:52,557
What's got into you? l left for a minute
to find you something to eat.

804
00:54:52,648 --> 00:54:53,763
l know but....

805
00:54:53,888 --> 00:54:55,844
Here, eat your head off.

806
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,367
l don't want it now.

807
00:54:57,448 --> 00:54:59,916
-l thought you said you were hungry.
-l was, but--

808
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:01,276
But what?

809
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:03,836
l was so scared, it scared the hunger--

810
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:07,159
Holy jumping catfish.
You drive a guy crazy.

811
00:55:48,568 --> 00:55:50,604
lt's liable to get chilly before morning.

812
00:55:50,808 --> 00:55:52,321
Better use this.

813
00:56:27,128 --> 00:56:28,607
What are you thinking about?

814
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,048
By a strange coincidence,
l was thinking of you.

815
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:36,239
-Really?
-Yeah.

816
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:40,765
l was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

817
00:57:13,688 --> 00:57:15,918
What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?

818
00:57:16,048 --> 00:57:17,197
Hitchhiking.

819
00:57:19,488 --> 00:57:23,003
You've given me a very good example
of the hiking.

820
00:57:23,328 --> 00:57:25,319
Where does the hitching come in?

821
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,797
lt's a little early yet. No cars out.

822
00:57:30,128 --> 00:57:31,959
lf it's the same to you...

823
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:36,120
...l'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.

824
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:47,847
You got a toothpick?

825
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:50,556
-What's the matter?
-l got hay in my teeth.

826
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:54,078
No, l haven't got a toothpick.
Here, l got a penknife, though.

827
00:57:54,568 --> 00:57:55,603
Now hold still.

828
00:57:55,688 --> 00:57:58,122
-Be careful.
-All right. Where is it?

829
00:57:59,568 --> 00:58:01,206
All right, now hold still.

830
00:58:02,568 --> 00:58:04,365
Here. Get it?

831
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,242
Thanks.

832
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:10,118
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?

833
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,880
You needn't rub it in.

834
00:58:15,888 --> 00:58:18,243
-What are you eating?
-Carrots.

835
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:20,598
-Raw?
-Want one?

836
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:24,881
No. Why didn't you get me
something l could eat?

837
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:28,961
That's right, l forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

838
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:32,280
You don't think l'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

839
00:58:32,368 --> 00:58:34,882
Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

840
00:58:34,968 --> 00:58:36,959
l hate the horrid things.

841
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:42,398
l wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.

842
00:58:42,528 --> 00:58:44,837
And suppose nobody stops for us?

843
00:58:45,008 --> 00:58:48,364
They'll stop all right. lt's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.

844
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:50,040
And you're an expert l suppose.

845
00:58:50,168 --> 00:58:53,843
Expert. And l'll write a book
about it. Call it ''The Hitchhiker's Hail.''

846
00:58:53,928 --> 00:58:56,681
There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?

847
00:58:57,048 --> 00:58:58,720
-You think it's simple?
-No.

848
00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:01,886
Well, it is simple.
lt's all in that old thumb, see?

849
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:05,080
Some people do it like this. Or like this.

850
00:59:06,528 --> 00:59:08,200
All wrong. Never get anywhere.

851
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:09,323
The poor things.

852
00:59:09,408 --> 00:59:13,003
But that old thumb never fails.
lt's all a matter of how you do it, though.

853
00:59:13,128 --> 00:59:15,483
Now you take No. 1, for instance.

854
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:19,158
That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.

855
00:59:19,248 --> 00:59:21,808
You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.

856
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:25,005
-Clever.
-No. 2, that's a little wider movement.

857
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:27,318
Smile goes with this one, like this.

858
00:59:28,808 --> 00:59:31,880
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

859
00:59:33,368 --> 00:59:35,438
You figured that out all by yourself?.

860
00:59:35,688 --> 00:59:39,078
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.

861
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:41,728
When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.

862
00:59:41,808 --> 00:59:45,517
lt's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.

863
00:59:46,448 --> 00:59:48,040
That's amazing.

864
00:59:48,248 --> 00:59:51,445
But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.

865
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:52,802
Here comes a car.

866
00:59:52,888 --> 00:59:55,356
Okay. Now watch me.
l'm gonna use No. 1 .

867
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:58,520
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.

868
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:06,037
l still got my eye on the thumb.

869
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:09,041
Something must have gone wrong.
l'll try No. 2.

870
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,287
When you get to 100, wake me up.

871
01:00:50,408 --> 01:00:53,127
l don't think l'll write that book after all.

872
01:00:53,448 --> 01:00:55,598
Think of all the fun you had, though.

873
01:00:57,248 --> 01:00:59,045
You mind if l try?

874
01:00:59,808 --> 01:01:00,797
You?

875
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:03,765
Don't make me laugh.

876
01:01:05,168 --> 01:01:08,558
You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

877
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:11,881
l'll stop a car and l won't use my thumb.

878
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:13,921
What are you gonna do?

879
01:01:14,328 --> 01:01:16,159
lt's a system all my own.

880
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:38,522
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?

881
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,002
What for?

882
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:44,957
l proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.

883
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:48,998
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

884
01:01:49,088 --> 01:01:51,443
l'll remember that when we need 40 cars.

885
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:55,638
So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.

886
01:01:55,848 --> 01:02:00,842
But if l was young, that's the way
l'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.

887
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:05,206
Yes, sir. ''Hitchhiking down the highway

888
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:09,122
''Of love on a honeymoon

889
01:02:09,288 --> 01:02:12,007
''Hitchhiking down the highway, down''

890
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,678
Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

891
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,799
Tonsil? Me? No.

892
01:02:28,728 --> 01:02:33,165
Me burn a tonsil? ''My tonsils won't burn''

893
01:02:34,328 --> 01:02:36,683
All right, let it go.

894
01:02:36,888 --> 01:02:38,082
''Turn''

895
01:02:47,288 --> 01:02:48,516
How about a bite to eat?

896
01:02:48,648 --> 01:02:51,116
-That would be lovely.
-No thanks, we're not hungry.

897
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,278
Young people in love are never hungry.

898
01:02:53,368 --> 01:02:54,164
No.

899
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,921
''Young people in love

900
01:02:57,008 --> 01:03:00,796
''Are very seldom hungry

901
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:06,162
''People in love are very seldom hungry''

902
01:03:06,928 --> 01:03:10,045
What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?

903
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:13,282
Sure, l was. No fooling, l'm hungry.

904
01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:15,121
Eat a carrot.

905
01:03:15,848 --> 01:03:16,837
No.

906
01:03:18,008 --> 01:03:19,441
l'm going in to ask him.

907
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:21,519
You do and l'll break your neck.

908
01:03:33,088 --> 01:03:35,682
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

909
01:04:01,048 --> 01:04:02,322
l'm sorry....

910
01:04:02,728 --> 01:04:04,241
That's all right.

911
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:17,683
Hey! Come here!

912
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:20,838
You've got my suitcase!

913
01:04:42,328 --> 01:04:43,966
What happened to you? l was worried.

914
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:46,243
-Get in.
-Look at your face! You've got a cut!

915
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:48,166
Well, what happened?

916
01:04:48,248 --> 01:04:51,763
A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.

917
01:04:51,848 --> 01:04:53,201
How'd you get the car?

918
01:04:53,288 --> 01:04:56,325
l gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.

919
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:29,118
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

920
01:05:29,608 --> 01:05:31,599
Gotta start promoting some.

921
01:05:33,448 --> 01:05:36,246
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

922
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,004
That'll be good for ten gallons.

923
01:06:12,888 --> 01:06:16,039
l haven't changed my mind, Westley.
l want you to understand that.

924
01:06:16,128 --> 01:06:18,688
l don't like you. Never have. Never will.

925
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:20,606
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?

926
01:06:20,688 --> 01:06:23,248
You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.

927
01:06:23,328 --> 01:06:25,080
lt hasn't worried me for a minute.

928
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:27,597
Ellie and l got married
because we love each other.

929
01:06:27,728 --> 01:06:31,403
She's proving it. As far as l'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.

930
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:36,482
l see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?

931
01:06:37,448 --> 01:06:41,839
All right, you win.
l'll just have to get used to you.

932
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,923
l admit, l'm licked.
But it's only because l'm worried.

933
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:50,244
lf l don't find her soon, l'll go crazy.

934
01:06:50,328 --> 01:06:54,082
l could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. l've been watched so closely--

935
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:59,162
l know. Well, you can help now.
l've got a room full of reporters in there.

936
01:06:59,688 --> 01:07:01,724
Now, l want you to make a statement.

937
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:05,563
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.

938
01:07:05,648 --> 01:07:09,163
And that if she returns
l won't interfere with your marriage.

939
01:07:19,648 --> 01:07:22,003
-All right?
-Yeah, that's quite all right.

940
01:07:22,088 --> 01:07:23,157
Okay.

941
01:07:23,408 --> 01:07:25,968
l hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

942
01:07:26,048 --> 01:07:28,437
So do l. Thank you. Goodnight.

943
01:07:28,528 --> 01:07:29,847
Goodnight.

944
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,879
-All right, brat.
-Any luck?

945
01:07:33,968 --> 01:07:36,607
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.

946
01:07:36,768 --> 01:07:37,996
What about the money?

947
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:41,205
l talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.

948
01:07:41,288 --> 01:07:43,927
-l must think something up before morning.
-That's swell.

949
01:07:44,008 --> 01:07:48,604
Yeah? l'm glad you think so.
lf you ask me, l think it's foolish.

950
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:53,645
l told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.

951
01:07:57,528 --> 01:07:59,996
l thought you were in a hurry to get back.

952
01:08:04,848 --> 01:08:08,204
Whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?

953
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:10,838
Everybody will be asleep.

954
01:08:16,128 --> 01:08:18,801
Okay. Cottage no. 6.

955
01:08:43,848 --> 01:08:48,000
There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did l tell you--

956
01:08:48,088 --> 01:08:51,398
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

957
01:08:57,648 --> 01:08:59,240
We're on the last lap.

958
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:06,328
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

959
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,557
Yeah.

960
01:09:09,808 --> 01:09:11,526
You'll have a great story, won't you?

961
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:14,357
Yeah. Swell.

962
01:09:35,928 --> 01:09:37,122
Thanks.

963
01:10:10,768 --> 01:10:13,077
We certainly outsmarted your father.

964
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:16,519
l guess you ought to be happy.

965
01:10:17,328 --> 01:10:19,444
Am l going to see you in New York?

966
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:22,883
Nope.

967
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,316
Why not?

968
01:10:27,648 --> 01:10:30,845
l don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

969
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,962
There's no harm in your coming to see us.

970
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:37,847
Not interested.

971
01:10:41,648 --> 01:10:43,286
Won't l ever see you again?

972
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:46,199
What for? l've served my purpose!

973
01:10:46,328 --> 01:10:49,877
l brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

974
01:11:24,688 --> 01:11:26,758
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

975
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,403
Me?

976
01:11:30,848 --> 01:11:31,724
Yes.

977
01:11:33,648 --> 01:11:36,082
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?

978
01:11:38,648 --> 01:11:42,163
lt seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

979
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:46,926
Sure, l've thought about it. Who hasn't?

980
01:11:50,768 --> 01:11:53,236
lf l could ever meet the right sort of girl.

981
01:11:54,848 --> 01:11:56,281
Where are you gonna find her?

982
01:11:56,368 --> 01:11:58,677
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

983
01:11:58,808 --> 01:12:00,844
They don't come that way anymore.

984
01:12:05,568 --> 01:12:07,479
Have l ever thought about it?

985
01:12:09,088 --> 01:12:12,080
l've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

986
01:12:17,528 --> 01:12:22,124
l saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.

987
01:12:25,568 --> 01:12:27,160
That's where l'd like to take her.

988
01:12:29,368 --> 01:12:31,643
She'd have to be the sort of a girl...

989
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:35,284
...who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as l did.

990
01:12:41,128 --> 01:12:45,883
Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.

991
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:50,079
You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.

992
01:12:52,408 --> 01:12:54,797
That's the only place to live.

993
01:12:55,888 --> 01:13:00,518
The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.

994
01:13:06,168 --> 01:13:08,079
l've been thinking about it.

995
01:13:09,648 --> 01:13:13,038
Boy, if l could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.

996
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:23,076
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

997
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:25,807
l want to do all those things
you talked about.

998
01:13:27,128 --> 01:13:29,198
You better go back to your bed.

999
01:13:30,128 --> 01:13:33,359
l love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.

1000
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:37,043
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter...

1001
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:40,288
...l can't let you out of my life now.

1002
01:13:41,368 --> 01:13:43,802
l couldn't live without you.

1003
01:13:56,928 --> 01:13:58,998
You'd better go back to your bed.

1004
01:14:08,008 --> 01:14:09,361
l'm sorry.

1005
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:49,242
Did you mean that? Would you really go?

1006
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:30,640
All l'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

1007
01:15:30,768 --> 01:15:32,247
That bag's worth $25.

1008
01:15:33,168 --> 01:15:35,045
l got a bag. l got one for Christmas--

1009
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:37,596
Here's what l'll do.
l'll come back in the morning...

1010
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:39,758
...and buy it back from you
with a $10 profit.

1011
01:15:39,848 --> 01:15:42,043
-What do you say?
-l ain't got a hat.

1012
01:15:42,368 --> 01:15:44,245
-What?
-l ain't got a hat.

1013
01:15:44,768 --> 01:15:47,328
Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.

1014
01:15:54,488 --> 01:15:57,924
Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.

1015
01:15:58,008 --> 01:16:01,637
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.

1016
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:02,877
Sure, boss.

1017
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:06,597
Hello, Agnes.

1018
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:09,964
-Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
-Haven't been shot at in days.

1019
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:12,846
-Get out of here! Get out!
-Now listen, Joe.

1020
01:16:12,928 --> 01:16:13,883
Don't ''Joe'' me.

1021
01:16:13,968 --> 01:16:15,367
All right, Joe. Listen.

1022
01:16:15,448 --> 01:16:16,847
You know l've always liked you.

1023
01:16:16,928 --> 01:16:19,362
Anytime l could help you,
ran across a good story...

1024
01:16:19,448 --> 01:16:22,326
...l came running to you with it.
l got one now.

1025
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:24,877
The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.

1026
01:16:24,968 --> 01:16:26,640
-lt's yours.
-About the Andrews kid?

1027
01:16:26,768 --> 01:16:30,044
l've got it all written up, ready to go.
All l want is a $1,000.

1028
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,760
A $1,000? Get out of here before--

1029
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:33,839
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.

1030
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:36,362
l need a $1,000 and l need it quick.
l'm in a jam.

1031
01:16:36,448 --> 01:16:38,040
What's the $1,000 for?

1032
01:16:38,128 --> 01:16:39,686
To tear down the walls of Jericho.

1033
01:16:39,768 --> 01:16:41,486
Never mind. lf l told you that...

1034
01:16:41,568 --> 01:16:43,559
...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?

1035
01:16:43,648 --> 01:16:45,559
-She'll marry somebody else.
-You're drunk.

1036
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:47,479
Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?

1037
01:16:47,568 --> 01:16:50,287
-lf it was on the level.
-l got it, Joe.

1038
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:55,400
-Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
-l am.

1039
01:16:56,928 --> 01:16:58,600
-You?
-Yes.

1040
01:16:58,688 --> 01:17:01,805
Now l know you're drunk. l'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1041
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:04,322
For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.

1042
01:17:04,408 --> 01:17:07,002
We know each other.
You ought to know when l'm serious.

1043
01:17:07,088 --> 01:17:09,682
This is on the level.
l met her on a bus from Miami.

1044
01:17:09,768 --> 01:17:12,282
l've been with her every minute.
l'm in love with her.

1045
01:17:12,368 --> 01:17:14,882
You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.

1046
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:17,004
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.

1047
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:20,000
l gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know l'm gone.

1048
01:17:20,128 --> 01:17:23,359
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1049
01:17:23,568 --> 01:17:27,641
What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews--

1050
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:29,161
That's it.

1051
01:17:30,968 --> 01:17:32,640
Let me see that a minute.

1052
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:36,277
Zeke!

1053
01:17:39,728 --> 01:17:42,606
l told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.

1054
01:17:42,768 --> 01:17:43,598
Who?

1055
01:17:43,768 --> 01:17:47,363
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.

1056
01:17:47,448 --> 01:17:50,599
We wouldn't have known till morning
if l hadn't took that magnesia.

1057
01:17:50,688 --> 01:17:53,361
Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1058
01:17:53,448 --> 01:17:56,565
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.

1059
01:18:10,088 --> 01:18:11,601
See that? They're gone.

1060
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:14,765
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?

1061
01:18:15,888 --> 01:18:18,197
Ma! Here's the woman.

1062
01:18:18,688 --> 01:18:20,963
-What's the matter?
-Where's your husband?

1063
01:18:21,448 --> 01:18:24,008
-Husband?
-Yes, if he is your husband.

1064
01:18:25,888 --> 01:18:28,925
-lsn't he here?
-No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.

1065
01:18:30,888 --> 01:18:32,560
You got any money?

1066
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:34,806
-No.
-Then you'll have to git!

1067
01:18:34,888 --> 01:18:36,606
Yeah. You'll have to git.

1068
01:18:39,488 --> 01:18:42,048
Please, may l use your phone?
l've got to call New York.

1069
01:18:42,128 --> 01:18:44,119
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.

1070
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:48,406
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1071
01:18:50,048 --> 01:18:54,405
And listen, next time you better not come
back here. l run a respectable place.

1072
01:18:58,248 --> 01:19:01,285
-Thanks, you saved my life.
-Okay. So long kid and good luck.

1073
01:19:01,368 --> 01:19:05,281
Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.

1074
01:19:05,648 --> 01:19:08,765
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaper man in the business.

1075
01:19:08,888 --> 01:19:11,402
Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.

1076
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:13,236
Hold up the morning edition.

1077
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:15,888
Break down the front page.
We'll have a new layout.

1078
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:19,597
Send in a couple of rewrite men.
And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.

1079
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:23,761
l've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, l'm busy.

1080
01:19:23,848 --> 01:19:28,080
Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1081
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:32,559
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
l want a cartoon and l want it quick.

1082
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:35,204
Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church...

1083
01:19:35,288 --> 01:19:38,121
...with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.

1084
01:19:38,288 --> 01:19:40,324
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.

1085
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:43,957
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?

1086
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:48,478
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1087
01:19:48,648 --> 01:19:52,197
l'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.

1088
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:55,200
He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.

1089
01:19:55,288 --> 01:19:57,643
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.

1090
01:19:57,728 --> 01:20:00,606
When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1091
01:20:00,688 --> 01:20:04,283
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.

1092
01:20:04,448 --> 01:20:07,360
Agnes, get me a doctor,
l'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1093
01:20:07,448 --> 01:20:09,837
Hank, forget what l told you.
l'm having a nightmare.

1094
01:20:09,928 --> 01:20:13,443
Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1095
01:20:13,528 --> 01:20:16,201
Send out a general alarm.
l want that dirty crook pinched.

1096
01:20:16,288 --> 01:20:17,084
You want us?

1097
01:20:17,168 --> 01:20:20,205
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.

1098
01:20:20,288 --> 01:20:23,121
She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.

1099
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:25,676
She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!

1100
01:20:25,768 --> 01:20:29,397
Play it up big! Major league!
''Love Triumphant.'' Go on, hop to it.

1101
01:20:29,568 --> 01:20:30,523
Okay.

1102
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,847
Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.

1103
01:20:59,248 --> 01:21:01,443
Can't you drive any faster?

1104
01:21:04,248 --> 01:21:10,039
''Young people in love are never hungry''

1105
01:21:18,928 --> 01:21:21,806
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.

1106
01:21:32,128 --> 01:21:35,325
Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.

1107
01:21:39,088 --> 01:21:42,080
All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.

1108
01:21:42,168 --> 01:21:43,886
Come on, step back.

1109
01:21:45,928 --> 01:21:47,998
How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?

1110
01:21:48,088 --> 01:21:50,966
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1111
01:21:59,528 --> 01:22:04,522
''He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

''The daring young man
on the flying trapeze''

1113
01:22:21,928 --> 01:22:23,520
Get that thing out of the way!

1114
01:22:23,608 --> 01:22:27,362
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.

1115
01:22:49,008 --> 01:22:50,726
Hey, you darn fool!

1116
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:57,483
Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.

1117
01:24:06,368 --> 01:24:07,926
Gordon's out back some place.

1118
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:11,677
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him l was just kidding.

1119
01:24:15,128 --> 01:24:17,926
-You can't get a thing done around here.
-Peter was just in.

1120
01:24:18,008 --> 01:24:19,361
-What?
-He left this money.

1121
01:24:19,448 --> 01:24:21,643
-He said he was just kidding.
-Where is he?

1122
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:23,639
-There he goes.
-Hey, Pete!

1123
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:31,324
Hello. l'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
l thought l'd have some fun with you.

1124
01:24:31,408 --> 01:24:34,161
Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.

1125
01:24:34,248 --> 01:24:37,081
-lt wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
-No, great.

1126
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:40,319
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn...

1127
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:45,004
...and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.

1128
01:24:45,768 --> 01:24:48,282
Yeah. Where am l?

1129
01:24:53,608 --> 01:24:56,406
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1130
01:24:57,568 --> 01:24:58,557
Thanks.

1131
01:25:22,808 --> 01:25:23,957
Ellie?

1132
01:25:24,488 --> 01:25:25,762
Hello, Dad.

1133
01:25:25,848 --> 01:25:27,440
l knocked several times.

1134
01:25:28,408 --> 01:25:30,968
l'm sorry. l must have been daydreaming.

1135
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:34,961
Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.

1136
01:25:35,568 --> 01:25:37,638
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1137
01:25:38,368 --> 01:25:39,164
Stunt?

1138
01:25:39,248 --> 01:25:41,364
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1139
01:25:44,768 --> 01:25:46,087
Yes, l heard.

1140
01:25:46,168 --> 01:25:48,079
Personally, l think it's silly, too.

1141
01:25:49,288 --> 01:25:51,085
You look lovely, child.

1142
01:25:51,168 --> 01:25:53,079
Are you pleased with the gown?

1143
01:25:54,328 --> 01:25:55,283
Ellie?

1144
01:25:57,688 --> 01:26:00,407
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1145
01:26:06,368 --> 01:26:08,006
What's the matter, child?

1146
01:26:11,008 --> 01:26:12,282
What's wrong?

1147
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:13,517
Nothing.

1148
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:16,636
You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?

1149
01:26:16,768 --> 01:26:17,803
No.

1150
01:26:18,008 --> 01:26:22,160
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how l feel about him.

1151
01:26:22,328 --> 01:26:25,479
Well, you gave me such a scare
when l couldn't find you.

1152
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:28,367
You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.

1153
01:26:28,888 --> 01:26:33,245
l'm sorry, Father. l wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.

1154
01:26:33,408 --> 01:26:35,080
What's the matter, child?

1155
01:26:36,328 --> 01:26:37,681
Aren't you happy?

1156
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:42,400
l thought so.

1157
01:26:42,888 --> 01:26:45,561
l knew there was something on your mind.

1158
01:26:47,488 --> 01:26:49,206
There, now.

1159
01:26:51,328 --> 01:26:52,841
What's the matter?

1160
01:26:54,448 --> 01:26:57,485
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1161
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,602
Have you?

1162
01:27:04,008 --> 01:27:06,761
l haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1163
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:09,924
This must be serious.

1164
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:12,766
Where'd you meet him?

1165
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:16,127
On the road.

1166
01:27:16,368 --> 01:27:19,166
Now don't tell me you've fallen in love
with a bus driver?

1167
01:27:19,288 --> 01:27:20,516
Oh, no.

1168
01:27:25,048 --> 01:27:26,197
Who is he?

1169
01:27:27,528 --> 01:27:29,678
l don't know very much about him.

1170
01:27:30,568 --> 01:27:32,445
Except that l love him.

1171
01:27:32,688 --> 01:27:35,805
lf it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to--

1172
01:27:35,928 --> 01:27:39,159
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1173
01:27:39,608 --> 01:27:40,438
Come now.

1174
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:43,486
Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.

1175
01:27:43,648 --> 01:27:49,405
He says that l'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.

1176
01:27:49,768 --> 01:27:51,121
Ridiculous.

1177
01:27:51,568 --> 01:27:53,957
He doesn't think so much of you, either.

1178
01:27:54,088 --> 01:27:55,043
Well, l--

1179
01:27:55,128 --> 01:27:57,926
And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1180
01:27:58,168 --> 01:28:00,636
He says you raised me stupidly.

1181
01:28:01,128 --> 01:28:03,926
And now that's a fine man
to fall in love with.

1182
01:28:04,448 --> 01:28:06,040
He's marvellous.

1183
01:28:06,288 --> 01:28:09,325
What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?

1184
01:28:10,408 --> 01:28:13,206
-l don't know.
-l'd like to have a talk with him.

1185
01:28:13,368 --> 01:28:17,327
lt wouldn't do any good.
l practically threw myself at him.

1186
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:21,757
Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?.

1187
01:28:23,088 --> 01:28:24,601
No, l'll go through with it.

1188
01:28:24,688 --> 01:28:27,521
But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.

1189
01:28:27,688 --> 01:28:30,725
No, it doesn't matter.
l don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1190
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:32,998
l've done it all my life.

1191
01:28:33,088 --> 01:28:36,444
l've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.

1192
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:42,362
l'm tired, father. l'm tired
of running around in circles.

1193
01:28:43,328 --> 01:28:46,684
He's right, that's what l've been doing
ever since l can remember.

1194
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:49,160
l've got to settle down.

1195
01:28:50,128 --> 01:28:53,086
lt doesn't matter how,
where, or with whom.

1196
01:28:54,648 --> 01:28:57,287
You've changed, Ellie.

1197
01:28:57,968 --> 01:29:02,405
l can't walk out on King now.
lt would make us all look so ridiculous.

1198
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:06,439
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1199
01:29:07,528 --> 01:29:09,484
l'll never see Peter again.

1200
01:29:09,728 --> 01:29:11,366
ls that his name?

1201
01:29:13,168 --> 01:29:14,567
Peter Warne.

1202
01:29:15,728 --> 01:29:17,366
Peter Warne.

1203
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,527
Why, do you know him?

1204
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,206
Why, no.

1205
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:25,956
Father, you haven't heard from him,
have you?

1206
01:29:26,088 --> 01:29:29,080
-Don't be silly, of course.
-Please, what's that?

1207
01:29:41,408 --> 01:29:45,196
l guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?

1208
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:48,286
-The reward.
-l'm sorry you read it.

1209
01:29:48,368 --> 01:29:51,246
-Are you going to see him?
-l suppose so.

1210
01:29:52,368 --> 01:29:56,156
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1211
01:29:56,528 --> 01:30:00,601
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
lt's worth every penny he gets.

1212
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:03,522
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what l needed.

1213
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,684
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1214
01:30:05,808 --> 01:30:07,480
Fine, have him come in.

1215
01:30:13,968 --> 01:30:15,447
l'll be going.

1216
01:30:26,288 --> 01:30:29,519
lf it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.

1217
01:30:29,608 --> 01:30:30,961
How are you, Ellie?

1218
01:30:31,768 --> 01:30:32,644
You happy?

1219
01:30:32,728 --> 01:30:35,162
Happy? Why shouldn't l be happy?

1220
01:30:35,528 --> 01:30:37,519
Here we are, let's drink.

1221
01:30:37,608 --> 01:30:40,805
lt's up to you now.
l want our life to be full of excitement.

1222
01:30:40,888 --> 01:30:44,039
We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.

1223
01:30:44,168 --> 01:30:46,557
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1224
01:30:47,128 --> 01:30:51,246
-Promise you'll never let me get off.
-Whatever you say, darling. lt's a promise.

1225
01:31:07,088 --> 01:31:09,283
Yeah. Who?

1226
01:31:11,888 --> 01:31:13,401
Why can't l see you at your office?

1227
01:31:13,688 --> 01:31:16,964
l'm leaving for Washington tonight.
l may be gone several weeks.

1228
01:31:17,048 --> 01:31:20,085
l thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1229
01:31:20,248 --> 01:31:23,604
Yeah. But l don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1230
01:31:23,688 --> 01:31:26,248
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1231
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:29,479
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1232
01:31:29,608 --> 01:31:31,997
No. Why do l wanna--

1233
01:31:35,048 --> 01:31:39,200
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe l will come over. Yeah.

1234
01:31:39,568 --> 01:31:42,560
l'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.

1235
01:31:42,648 --> 01:31:45,162
l wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1236
01:31:45,248 --> 01:31:47,398
l haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1237
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:50,879
Mr. Warne?

1238
01:31:50,968 --> 01:31:52,083
Yeah.

1239
01:31:54,768 --> 01:31:56,998
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

1240
01:31:57,368 --> 01:32:01,122
l was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything...

1241
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,119
...about you. About your helping her.

1242
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:06,200
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1243
01:32:06,328 --> 01:32:08,717
Why did she think
l lugged her from Miami?

1244
01:32:08,928 --> 01:32:11,488
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1245
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:15,641
She does? lsn't that sweet of her?
You don't, l suppose.

1246
01:32:15,768 --> 01:32:20,046
Well, l don't know. l'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1247
01:32:20,128 --> 01:32:21,925
l presume you feel justified.

1248
01:32:22,008 --> 01:32:25,318
lf l didn't, l wouldn't be here.
l got it all itemised.

1249
01:32:27,888 --> 01:32:32,678
''Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.

1250
01:32:32,768 --> 01:32:35,407
''Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.

1251
01:32:35,488 --> 01:32:41,085
''Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.

1252
01:32:41,568 --> 01:32:44,526
''All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline.''

1253
01:32:44,688 --> 01:32:47,566
And l sold some shorts and socks, too.
l'm throwing those in.

1254
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:50,839
-Yes, l know.
-What's the matter? lsn't it cheap enough?

1255
01:32:51,128 --> 01:32:53,642
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000,
maybe more.

1256
01:32:53,728 --> 01:32:58,722
Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?

1257
01:32:59,128 --> 01:33:00,641
What 10,000?

1258
01:33:01,088 --> 01:33:02,441
The reward.

1259
01:33:03,168 --> 01:33:05,477
Who said anything about a reward?

1260
01:33:05,648 --> 01:33:08,287
l'm afraid l'm a little bit confused.
l assumed--

1261
01:33:08,368 --> 01:33:12,680
All l want is $39.60. lf you give
me a check for it, l'll get out of this joint.

1262
01:33:12,848 --> 01:33:14,486
lt gives me the jitters.

1263
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:18,325
-You're a peculiar chap.
-We'll go into that some other time.

1264
01:33:18,408 --> 01:33:21,047
The average man would go
after the reward.

1265
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:23,403
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1266
01:33:23,488 --> 01:33:26,400
lt's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.

1267
01:33:26,488 --> 01:33:30,197
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
l don't like paying for the privilege.

1268
01:33:30,288 --> 01:33:32,119
Were you taken for a buggy ride?

1269
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:35,963
Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do l get it?

1270
01:33:36,608 --> 01:33:38,405
-Certainly.
-Thanks.

1271
01:33:52,328 --> 01:33:53,761
Here you are.

1272
01:33:54,088 --> 01:33:55,237
Thank you.

1273
01:33:56,528 --> 01:33:59,486
Do you mind if l ask you a question,
frankly?

1274
01:33:59,848 --> 01:34:01,725
Do you love my daughter?

1275
01:34:03,048 --> 01:34:05,926
Any guy in love with your daughter
should be examined.

1276
01:34:06,008 --> 01:34:07,327
Now that's an evasion.

1277
01:34:07,448 --> 01:34:11,441
She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.

1278
01:34:11,768 --> 01:34:15,477
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1279
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:18,480
lf you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.

1280
01:34:18,568 --> 01:34:19,717
Do you love her?

1281
01:34:19,808 --> 01:34:22,766
A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.

1282
01:34:22,848 --> 01:34:24,167
She's my idea of nothing.

1283
01:34:24,248 --> 01:34:26,478
l asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?

1284
01:34:26,568 --> 01:34:30,561
Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
l'm a little screwy myself!

1285
01:34:32,728 --> 01:34:35,481
Here's to the merry-go-round.

1286
01:34:41,568 --> 01:34:44,036
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1287
01:34:49,288 --> 01:34:51,882
-l hope you got your money.
-You bet l did.

1288
01:34:52,008 --> 01:34:54,397
-Congratulations.
-Thanks. Same to you.

1289
01:34:55,048 --> 01:34:57,926
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1290
01:34:58,008 --> 01:35:00,283
l would, but l've got a weak stomach.

1291
01:35:06,408 --> 01:35:09,081
-l just had a long talk with him.
-l'm not interested.

1292
01:35:09,168 --> 01:35:10,442
Now just a minute, Ellie.

1293
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:13,042
l don't want to hear
another word about him.

1294
01:35:25,288 --> 01:35:27,927
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.

1295
01:36:19,768 --> 01:36:21,963
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.

1296
01:36:49,448 --> 01:36:51,564
You're a sucker to go through with this.

1297
01:36:52,928 --> 01:36:54,919
That guy, Warne, is okay.

1298
01:36:55,248 --> 01:36:59,366
He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.

1299
01:36:59,448 --> 01:37:02,758
lt's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.

1300
01:37:02,848 --> 01:37:04,725
You took him for a ride.

1301
01:37:11,688 --> 01:37:14,566
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1302
01:37:17,008 --> 01:37:19,886
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1303
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:22,483
l can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1304
01:37:26,248 --> 01:37:28,557
And you can make an old man happy.

1305
01:37:28,648 --> 01:37:31,208
And you won't do so bad for yourself.

1306
01:37:31,608 --> 01:37:34,600
lf you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1307
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:48,605
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

1308
01:37:48,688 --> 01:37:52,317
...and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman...

1309
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:56,640
...in holy matrimony. lf any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully...

1310
01:37:56,728 --> 01:38:01,722
...be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.

1311
01:38:04,408 --> 01:38:09,084
King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?

1312
01:38:09,568 --> 01:38:10,523
l will.

1313
01:38:11,688 --> 01:38:15,124
Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1314
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:17,403
...so long as you both shall live?

1315
01:38:20,968 --> 01:38:21,957
Ellen!

1316
01:38:23,448 --> 01:38:24,597
Ellie!

1317
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,637
What happened?

1318
01:38:54,768 --> 01:38:56,759
l haven't the slightest idea.

1319
01:39:10,928 --> 01:39:14,887
Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.

1320
01:39:14,968 --> 01:39:16,481
Don't want to see anybody.

1321
01:39:16,568 --> 01:39:18,320
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1322
01:39:21,608 --> 01:39:27,604
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
l've sent you a check for $100,000.

1323
01:39:28,088 --> 01:39:32,479
That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.

1324
01:39:32,848 --> 01:39:36,318
That's satisfactory, isn't it? lt ought to be.

1325
01:39:36,568 --> 01:39:40,720
l'm not complaining.
Not complaining. lt was dirt-cheap.

1326
01:39:41,808 --> 01:39:44,038
Don't fall out of any windows!

1327
01:39:45,408 --> 01:39:48,480
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1328
01:39:49,008 --> 01:39:52,478
''What's holding up the annulment,
you slowpoke.

1329
01:39:52,808 --> 01:39:55,800
''The walls of Jericho are toppling.''

1330
01:39:57,328 --> 01:40:01,765
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, ''Let them topple.''

1331
01:40:04,768 --> 01:40:06,724
-Funny couple, ain't they?
-Yeah.

1332
01:40:06,888 --> 01:40:09,083
lf you ask me,
l don't believe they're married.

1333
01:40:09,168 --> 01:40:11,557
They're married, all right.
l just seen the license.

1334
01:40:12,048 --> 01:40:15,518
They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.

1335
01:40:15,648 --> 01:40:16,967
What do you reckon that's for?

1336
01:40:17,368 --> 01:40:19,518
Blamed if l know.
l just brought them a trumpet.

1337
01:40:19,608 --> 01:40:20,643
A trumpet?

1338
01:40:20,728 --> 01:40:23,083
A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.

1339
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,443
What in the world do they want
a trumpet for?

1340
01:40:25,528 --> 01:40:26,643
Don't know.
