<i>- [Man] What happened? - [Woman] Step away from her.</i>

26

不是他做的

27
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,277
Oh, man, he ain't done nothing.

28
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,304
那些小流氓 是他抢了你的皮包？

29
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,337
- Those kids. - Who took your bag? This man?

30
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,509
不是他，是几个小流氓 已经跑了

31
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,509
<i>No, it was a couple of punks. They came and they just ran off.</i>

32
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,450
注意，抢劫攻击被害人…

33
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,519
Four-eight, this is Romano. Robbery and assault victim...

34
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,545
脸部受伤，在东42街入口

35
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,578
with facial wound at East 42nd entrance.

36
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,749
先生，请你站过来

37
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,782
Sir, I'd like you to just stand right there.

38
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,385
好

39
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,020
- Certainly. - Are you traveling somewhere?

40
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,987
你要去哪儿？

41
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:51,427
I have arrived. My travels are over for the time being.

42
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,387
我刚到，暂时不会走

43
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,060
你的行李呢？

44
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,930
Where's your luggage?

45
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,130
我没有行李

46
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,967
- I don't require luggage. - Do you have a ticket?

47

<i>Train ticket? Ticket stub?</i>

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,564
我不是坐火车来的

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,598
I didn't arrive by train.

52
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,540
麻烦你把太阳眼镜拿掉

53
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,540
Would you remove your sunglasses for me, please?

54
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,907
最好不要

55
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:10,345
Oh, I'd rather not. I'd forgotten, but I mean, wow,

56
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,345
我完全忘了…

57
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,475
你们的星球有多亮

58
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,509
your planet is really bright.

59
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,952
是吗？东42街 有名男子精神异常

60
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,986
I see. East 42, we have an E.D.P.

61
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,080
麻烦你跟我们回去

62
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,114
I have to ask you to come with us, sir.

63

<i>[Female Officer] Freddy!</i>

00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,613
他是不是从月台出来的？

68
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,976
Did you see this fella come out of a gate?

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,951
不是，他突然就出现了

70
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,982
He didn't come from no gate. Brother came from nowhere.

71
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,047
你明白我的意思吗？

72
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,116
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

73
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,184
明白，我明白你的意思

74
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,217
Yeah, Freddy, I know what you're saying.

00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,502
<i>I don't wanna go outside, because there's things that can kill you...</i>

81
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,803
外面太危险了

82
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,679
谢谢

83
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,837
thank you.

84
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,772
你要是闻到那些化学物质

85
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,806
If you breathe all those chemicals out there,

86
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,443
尤其是宇宙辐射线 和西尼罗河病毒

87
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,647
not to mention the cosmic rays and the West Nile virus,

88
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,985
还有那个…

89
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,519
and that other one... the new airborne pigeon disease nobody wants to talk about.

90
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,487
没人敢提的新鸽子传染病

91
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,454
我听过那个病

92
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,489
The new pigeon disease. I've heard of that.

93
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,391
我最受不了的是伙食

94
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,459
Another thing that's been bothering me is the food.

95
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,520
餐厅的食物不够热，有细菌

96
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,554
The cafeteria serves lukewarm food, full of germs.

97
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,758
鲍威尔医生，你们应该想想办法

98
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,496
<i>You really need to do something about that, Dr. Powell.</i>

99
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,925
加热才能杀菌

100
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,797
Heat is the only thing that kills germs. Heat.

101
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,562
知道了，我们会注意

102
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,599
<i>Point taken. We'll look into that right away.</i>

103
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,606
另外呢…

104
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:24,109
In the meantime, I want you to start taking your medication again.

105
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,073
我要你开始吃药

106
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,839
帮助你入睡，你要好好睡觉

107
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,873
It'll help you sleep. And you need the sleep, Ernie.

108
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,880
对你的身体好

109
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,914
Sleep is good.

110
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,006
<i>[Buzzer Buzzes]</i>

111
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,779
时间到了吗？

112
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,479
Is our time up?

113
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,214
今天的时间到了

114
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,253
Only for today, Ernie.

115
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,059
两通电话，你太太叫你带瓶酒

116
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,083
Two calls: Your wife, bring home a bottle of wine.

117
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,061
好         还有查克伯堤医生

118
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,095
- Yeah. - And Dr. Chakraborty.

119
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,665
他要你看一下转院病人的资料

120
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,688
A transfer from Bellevue he wants you to take a look at.

121
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:51,203
好极了，这次是谁 耶稣还是圣女贞德

122
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:51,226
Great. Who is it this time? Jesus Christ or Joan of Arc?

123
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,966
查克伯堤医生没说

124
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,363
Dr. Chakraborty didn't say.

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,631
他一个月前入院

126
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,660
<i>[Man] He arrived at Bellevue a month ago,</i>

127
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,169
起先怀疑他服食迷幻药

128
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,203
<i>suspicion of hallucinogenic intoxication.</i>

129
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,502
可是又验不出任何药物反应

130
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,536
<i>But, uh, he was found negative for substances of any kind.</i>

131
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,906
心电图和血液都很正常

132
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,906
His EKG, his blood value are all normal.

133
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,035
没有脑震荡，没有脑肿瘤

134
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,309
There's no sign of concussion, no brain tumor,

135
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,772
没有颞叶癫痫

136
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,145
no temporal lobe, epilepsy, no indication of organic abnormality whatsoever.

137
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,111
也没有任何器官异常的迹象

138
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,611
不过，治疗一个月以后

139
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,684
However, after one month,

140
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,552
他的健忘症、妄想症还是存在

141
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,585
his amnesia and his delusion have persisted.

142
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,089
他自称不是人类

143
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,122
He claims to be not human.

144
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,489
是外星人

145
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,660
A visitor from another planet.

146
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,663
注射了三个礼拜的镇定剂

147
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,526
They administered thorazine on this guy for three weeks...

148
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,291
每天三百毫克，他都没反应

149
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,328
at 300 milligrams a day, and he was unresponsive?

150
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,928
注射三百毫克也没反应？ 不可能

151
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,837
How can you be unresponsive to 300 milligrams of thorazine? It's impossible.

152
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,768
所以才交给你

153
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,930
That's why they sent him to you.

154
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,465
太好了

155
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,168
[Sighs] Terrific.

156
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,909
没有身份证 没有失踪人口报告

157
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,943
No I.D., no missing persons report matching his description.

158
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,379
这是什么？

159
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,241
What's this?

160
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,109
在他身上找到的

161
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,175
<i>He had it on him.</i>

162
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,012
希望外星人可以申请医疗补助

163
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,081
Well, let's hope extraterrestrials qualify for Medicaid.

164
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,422
医生，他来了

165
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,648
[Secretary] He's here, Doctor.

166
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,121
谢谢你，乔伊斯

167
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,660
Thank you, Joyce.

168
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,634
医疗记录287号，自称帕特

169
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,963
Medical record 2-8-7. Calls himself Prot.

170
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,094
<i>[Knock At Door, Door Opens]</i>

171
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,966
医生，这家伙像猫一样温驯

172
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,004
This one's as gentle as a pussycat, Doc.

173
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,634
进来，请坐

174
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,140
Come in. Have a seat.

175
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,805
请坐？奇怪的说法

176
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,839
"Have a seat." Curious expression.

177
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,117
让我自我介绍一下…

178
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,151
Well, let me introduce myself. I'm...

179
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,778
马克鲍威尔医生 临床精神科主治医师

180
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,812
Dr. Mark Powell, Chief of Clinical Psychiatry...

181
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,356
在曼哈顿精神疗养院服务

182
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,379
of the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute.

183
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,249
很好，你知道自己在哪儿

184
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,948
Good. You know where you are.

185
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,663
那么…

186
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,755
Well, now, uh... Prot, is it?

187
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,358
你叫帕特？         波特

188
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,131
- "Prote." - I see, "Prote."

189
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,096
好，波特

190
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,171
<i>- Well, Prot, we're here to... - May I?</i>

191
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,096
波特，我们要… 可以吗？

192
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,598
请便

193
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,632
Please.

194
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,274
你们叫这个苹果品种红蛇果

195
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,304
Red delicious. You call this variety.

196
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,814
是我最喜欢吃的

197
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,349
It's my favorite.

198
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,217
我想先问你知不知道…

199
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,409
<i>I'd like to begin by asking you...</i>

200
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,885
自己为什么在这里

201
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,551
if you know why you're here.

202
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,259
当然，你们以为我疯了

203
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,755
Of course. You think I'm crazy.

204
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,659
我们用“病”这个字

205
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:35,025
We prefer the term "ill." Do you think you are ill?

206
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,097
你认为自己有病吗？

207
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,395
也许吧，有点想家

208
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,398
A little homesick, perhaps.

209
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,067
真的？你家在哪儿？

210
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,101
Really. Where is home?

211
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,371
K-PAX星

212
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,197
K-PAX.

213
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,768
K-PAX星？

214
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,533
K-PAX?

215
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,743
大写K，连字号，大写PAX

216
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,768
Capital "K," hyphen, capitals "P-A-X."

217
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,440
K派斯是个星球

218
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,780
K-PAX is a planet.

219
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,847
放心，我不会寄生在你身上

220
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,875
But don't worry, I'm not going to leap out of your chest.

221
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,818
我并不担心

222
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,185
I'm not worried.

223
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,253
问题是，我只知道九大行星

224
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,355
It's just that I'm only familiar with nine planets.

225
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,985
其实是十大行星，不过没关系

226
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,824
Well, actually, there are ten, but that doesn't matter.

227
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,993
我不是来自这个太阳系

228
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,020
I'm not from your solar system.

229
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,428
K派斯距离地球一千光年

230
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,428
K-PAX is about 1,000 of your light-years away from here...

231
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,228
在你们所谓的天琴座附近

232
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,263
in what you would call your constellation Lyra.

233
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,599
那么远

234
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,768
That's quite a ways.

235
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,672
你是怎么来地球的

236
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,730
I'm curious. How did you get to Earth?

237
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,007
这是如何运用光能的问题

238
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,045
It's a matter of harnessing the energy of light.

239
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,606
你一定认为我疯了

240
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,672
I know that sounds crazy to you.

241
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,809
光束旅行不是你们能想像的

242
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,842
You beings are eons away from discovering light travel.

243
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,778
你用光的速度旅行？

244
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,812
You travel at the speed of light?

245
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,954
不，比那还要快多了

246
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:35,053
Oh, no. We can travel many times that speed. Various multiples of "C."

247
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,027
我是说，快上“好多”倍

248
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,291
否则，一趟旅行 至少要一千年才到得了

249
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,325
Otherwise, the trip here would have taken about 1,000 years now, wouldn't it?

250
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,998
要是我告诉你

251
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,702
What if, um, I were to tell you...

252
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,868
一个叫爱因斯坦的地球人说

253
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,934
that according to a man who lived on our planet named Einstein,

254
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,977
光的速度最快 没有东西快过它

255
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,967
that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light?

256
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,242
鲍威尔医生，你误解了他的话 可以叫你马克吗

257
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,276
I would say that you misread Einstein, Dr. Powell. May I call you Mark?

258
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,476
其实，爱因斯坦的意思是

259
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,476
<i>You see, Mark, what Einstein actually said...</i>

260
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,815
没有东西能加速到光速

261
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,850
was that nothing can accelerate to the speed of light,

262
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,912
因为质量会变得无限大

263
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,946
because its mass would become infinite.

264
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,888
爱因斯坦没提到

265
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:08,050
Einstein said nothing about entities already traveling at the speed of light or faster,

266
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,324
本来已经快过光的超光速粒子

267
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,358
- at tachyon speeds. - Tachyon?

268
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,323
超光速粒子？

269
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,094
你好像不相信我

270
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,128
I detect a note of skepticism, Dr. Powell.

271
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,601
不是，我只是惊讶…

272
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,635
Oh, not at all. It's just that you...

273
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,536
你的英文这么流利

274
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,933
you speak English so well.

275
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,039
学英文并不难

276
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,031
- I'm amazed. - Well, English isn't that difficult a language to learn.

277
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,769
你应该学说…

278
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:28,979
You should try speaking... [Speaking Alien Language]

279
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,053
我…我觉得奇怪

280
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,110
I'm... [Clears throat] I'm confused.

281
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,714
你可不可以解释给我听

282
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,747
Maybe you can explain it to me. Uh...

283
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,883
既然你是外星人

284
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,917
how is it that being a visitor from space,

285
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,518
为什么长得跟我

286
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,553
that you-you look so much like me...

287
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,120
还有其他地球人一样

288
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,154
or anyone else from Earth?

289
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,002
为什么肥皂泡是圆的？

290
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,037
Why is a soap bubble round?

291
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,335
为什么肥皂泡是圆的？

292
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,369
Why is a soap bubble round?

293
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,138
知道吗？身为一个知识份子 你老是重复别人的话

294
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,036
You know, for an educated person, Mark, you repeat things quite a bit.

295
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,542
你没发现吗？

296
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,545
Are you aware of that?

297
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,813
肥皂泡是圆的

298
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,847
A soap bubble is round...

299
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:10,714
因为那是最有能量效率的形状

300
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,684
because it is the most energy-efficient configuration.

301
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,452
同样的，在你的星球上，我像你

302
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,485
Similarly, on your planet, I look like you.

303
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,994
在K派斯，我就像K派斯人

304
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,028
On K-PAX, I look like a K-PAXian.

305
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,628
波特

306
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,654
Prot,

307
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,223
你为什么要来我们的星球？

308
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,257
why did you want to come to our planet?

309
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,367
我以前就来过好多次

310
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,402
Well, I've been here many times before.

311
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,970
我也不知道当初为什么会来

312
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,999
But what brought me here first? I don't know.

313
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,739
可能是因为好奇吧

314
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,635
Pure curiosity, I guess.

315
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,871
我从来没去过BA3级的行星

316
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,908
I'd never been to a Class BA-3 planet before.

317
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,506
BA3级？

318
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,074
Class BA-3?

319
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,050
处于进化初期

320
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,084
Early stage of evolution.

321
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,386
未来发展不确定

322
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,744
Future uncertain.

323
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,491
假如我把所有财产捐给贫民…

00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,863
You're really from... up there?

00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,268
是啊

332
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,071
Indeed.

<i>What...</i>

337
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,307
那是个什么样的地方？

338
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,372
What sort of place is it?

339
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,173
K派斯比你们的星球大

340
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,212
K-PAX is bigger than your planet.

341
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,585
被七个紫色的月亮环绕

342
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:17,347
But we are circled by seven purple moons.

Well, K-PAX is most lovely when K-MON and K-RIL are in conjunction.

You finish your homework, Abby?

00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,769
Yeah.

358
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,201
我又掉了一颗牙

359
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,201
I lost another tooth.

360
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,745
真的吗？让我看看

361
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,113
Oh, yeah? Let me see. Hey! Maybe the tooth fairy will come tonight. Huh?

362
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,077
说不定齿仙今天晚上会来

363
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,309
根本就没有齿仙

364

There's no such thing as the tooth fairy, Dad.

I fed them already. I couldn't wait. How was your day?

369
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,557
6点15的火车误点 到6点半才开

早知道就坐光束回来

372
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,496
Should have caught the nearest beam of light.

373
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,498
就坐什么回来？

374
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,498
You should have caught what?

375
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,091
没什么，你呢         不错

<i>- Oh, nothing. How was your day? - Good.</i>

00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,931
我付了度假屋的定金

378
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:41,104
Sent the deposit in for the house on the cape for the last two weeks of August.

379
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,063
日期定在8月最后两个礼拜

艾比的夏令营15号就结束 时间刚刚好

381

Which works out perfectly, 'cause Abby doesn't get out of camp till the 15th.

我们还不确定去不去

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,681
That wasn't definite. We were just talking. I said maybe.

388
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,048
我只是说也许8月去

389
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,082
Maybe sometime in August we'll clear it.

390
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,849
也许我们应该付钱请你伴游

391
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:58,317
Maybe. Maybe we should start paying you for your time. You got a family rate?

他们登了我的信

00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,589
我跟纳塔莉说了明年 参加课后辅导的事

396
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,589
I spoke with Natalie about going into the after-school program next year,

397
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,190
我想再回去教书

398
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,724
in case I go back to teaching.

399
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,859
今天早上，我的头掉下来

400
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,234
And this morning my head fell off, but I was able to sew it back on with dental floss.

401
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,200
还好我用牙线把它缝回去

402
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,239
有上蜡的那种

403
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:17,105
- Waxed, of course. - Dental floss?

404
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,104
牙线？

405
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,471
对不起，我没在听

406
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,438
<i>Sorry. I wasn't listening.</i>

407
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,206
我知道，吃饭吧

408
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,240
Yeah, I know. Let's just eat.

[Sighs] Train was late. I'm tired.

411

市立医院又拼命把病人塞进来

412
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,342
And to top it off, the city is dumping patients on us.

413
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,820
我知道

414
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,682

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,144
[Dr. Powell's Voice] And when did you arrive on Earth?

425
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,305
四年零九个月前

426
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,339
[Prot's Voice] Four years and nine months ago.

427
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,279
所以你是几岁？

428
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,348
[Dr. Powell] So that makes you how old?

429
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,352
以地球的算法，337岁

430
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,385
[Prot] In Earth terms, 337 years old.

431
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,718
我到的时候大概7岁 用六倍的光速旅行

432
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,752
I aged about seven getting here, traveling at six multiples of "C."

其实，马可，只是一眨眼的事

434
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,758
But really, Marko, it only seemed like an instant.

435
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:12,525
马可？ 超光速会将时间压缩

436
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,057
- Marko? - [Prot] time may warp at super light speed.

437
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,828
我认为是一级精神错乱

438
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,862
I'd say access one psychosis NOS.

439
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,927
这样就说他是精神病患 诊断也未免太过笼统

440
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,802
<i>That's glib to call him a psychotic. That's a wastebasket diagnosis.</i>

442
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,205
<i>Oh, yeah? He believes he traveled here from another planet.</i>

443
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,168
他自称来自外星球

444
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,368
难道说他患了飞行时差综合症

445
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,402
What's your diagnosis, jet lag?

446
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,942
那他为什么对氟哌醇没反应

447
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,968
Well, how come he didn't respond to the Haldol?

448
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,947
氟哌醇有可能会让病情更加严重

<i>[Woman] Haldol can make you more psychotic.</i>

00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,853
我不否认药物治疗有用

453
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,878
Look. I'm not saying that medication can't be a useful tool...

454

在治疗这样的病患方面…

455
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,355
to help somebody like this, but you can't...

456
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,253
我们可以拿他来进行 贝塔素的临床实验

457
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,293
<i>He may be a good subject for the "Betazine'"protocol. The drug's on clinical trial.</i>

还没诊断出病因就拿他来实验

<i>You want to experiment on him before we have a diagnosis?</i>

你有更好的提议？

461
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,428
Do you have some other idea?

462
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,934
他不会伤害任何人

463
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,459
He's not a danger to anyone. How about getting to know him first?

464
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,435
为什么不试着去了解他？

465
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,493
问题是…

466

<i>In the meantime, we have ten new transfers to take care of.</i>

<i>[Dr. Powell] You know, maybe what's wrong with him...</i>

你在K派斯的童年

484
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,002
a bit about your boyhood on K-PAX?

485
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,941
你在哪儿出生的？

486
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,009
Where were you born?

487
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:10,378
你是生出来的吧？

488
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:10,139
You were, uh, born, right?

489
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,109
K派斯人生小孩吧？

490
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,149
K-PAXians have babies?

491
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,708
对，和地球差不多 可是不像你们人类

492
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,777
Oh, yes, much like on Earth, but unlike you humans,

493
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,517
我们生殖的过程并不愉快

494
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,084
the reproductive process is quite unpleasant for us.

495
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,558
能不能用一个 我知道的例子来形容

496
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,990
Could you compare the effect to something that I might understand?

497
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,921
像是牙痛

498
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,051
<i>- Like a toothache? - It's more like having your nuts in a vise,</i>

499
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,292
比较像睾丸被夹到，痛不欲生

500
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,560
更糟的是，那种感觉让你

501
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,596
except we feel it all over.

502
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,600
And to make matters worse, the sensation is associated...

503
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,125
觉得反胃，同时闻到臭味

504
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,194
with something like your nausea, accompanied by a very bad smell.

505
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,502
高潮的时候像胃被踢了一脚

506
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,536
The moment of climax is like being kicked in the stomach,

507
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,599
然后掉进摩特的粪便里

508
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,633
and then falling into a pool of mod droppings.

509
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,541
摩特的粪便？

510
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,575
Mod droppings?

511
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,342
摩特就像你们的臭鼬

512
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:45,413
A mod is a being, much like your skunk, only far more potent.

513
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,541
不过比它更臭

514
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,516
<i>Uh, if it's such a terrible experience,</i>

515
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,221
既然这么恐怖

516
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,822
uh, how do you reproduce?

517
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,784
你们怎么繁殖？

518
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,556
尽量小心就是了

519
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,590
As carefully as possible.

520
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,658
你在干嘛？

521
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,598
What are you doing?

522
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:04,532
你让我想到有东西忘了写下来

523
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,033
Well, you just reminded me of something I want to include in my report.

524
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,762
写报告？

525
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,730
- Your report. - Yes, it's our custom...

526
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,361
对，我们的习惯

527
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,638
to compile descriptions of the various places and people we encounter...

528
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,637
记录下星系中去过的地方 遇到的人

529
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,676
throughout the galaxy.

530
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,217
早啊，贝蒂      早上好，波特

531
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,250
- Morning, Betty. - Good morning, Prot.

532
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,445
早啊，纳罗         你好啊

533
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,513
- Morning, Navarro. - Hey, what's up, man?

534
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,147
傅先生         早安，玛丽亚

535
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,181
Mr. Friedman. Morning, Maria.

536
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,780
我是凡妮萨

537
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,590
- I'm Vanessa. - [Navarro] Just chill.

538
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,553
别怕，放轻松

539
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,821
早啊，贝丝

540
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,490
Morning, Bess.

541
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,727
她不理人的

542
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:38,097
<i>She doesn't talk to anybody. Afraid smoke will come out of her mouth when she talks.</i>

543
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,069
怕一开口会有烟冒出来

544
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,037
从小就来了，房子被她烧掉

545
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,037
<i>Been here since she was a little girl. Burned her house down.</i>

546
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:44,165
不应该玩火柴，太危险了

547
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,836
Shouldn't play with matches. Very dangerous.

548
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:48,645
明明是电线走火，你干嘛骗人

549
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,202
It was an electrical fire. Why do you make up stories like that?

550
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,147
恩尼的想像力非常丰富

551
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,182
Ernie has a very powerful imagination.

552
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,677
俗气

553
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,711
<i>[Woman] Philistine!</i>

554
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,653
别这样，多丽丝

555
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:01,725
Come on, Doris. You gotta come out of your room sometime.

556
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,658
偶尔也要出来走走啊

557
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,819
看我替你带了什么

558
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,852
<i>Look what I brought just for you.</i>

559
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,060
呸、呸、呸…

560
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,060
<i>[Doris] Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.</i>

561
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,396
再这样就送你去三楼

562
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,465
<i>[Intern] Do that again, you go up to three.</i>

563
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,097
女王陛下从来不出房门一步 也不吃东西

564
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,137
Her Royal Highness never, ever comes out of her room. Not even for eating.

565
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,369
难怪会在这里，我受够她了

566
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,403
<i>No wonder she's here. I'm sick and tired of this shit.</i>

567
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,446
每天来都是这样，可恶

568
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,469
<i>Every day, coming up here and shooting food at me. I hate this.</i>

569
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,150
<i>[Clanging]</i>

570
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,020
服务实在太差了

571
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,055
The service here is atrocious!

572
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,288
早上好，阿彻太太…多丽丝

573
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:38,358
Good morning, Mrs. Archer. Doris.

574
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,694
[Chuckles]

575
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,133
我一直以为今天下午

576
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,167
I wasn't expecting any gentleman callers...

577
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,466
才会有男访客

578
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,500
until this afternoon.

579
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,471
不好意思

580
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,505
Excuse me.

581
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,252
你有两份餐具

582
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,279
You have a place set for two.

583
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:11,661
对，我在等人

584
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:11,525
Oh, yes. Um... I'm expecting someone.

585
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,788
你等了多久？

586
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,788
How long have you been waiting?

587
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,156
十一年

588
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,890
Eleven years.

589
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,561
[Laughs]

590
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:23,037
这里有些人认为

591
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:23,074
For some around here might...

592
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:27,339
这样等是神经病，我认为是…

593
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,269
call that crazy, but I prefer to call it...

594
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,743
罗曼蒂克

595
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,779
[Sniffles] Romantic.

596
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,848
罗曼蒂克？         就像…

597
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,873
- Romantic. - Like a, uh...

598
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,880
在月光下跳舞，或者…

599
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,915
waltz in the moonlight, or a...

600
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,751
共进烛光晚餐

601
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,751
candlelit dinner...

602
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,881
或者欣赏落日

603
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,224
- or a sunset. - Oh, we have those.

604
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,186
那个我们也有

605
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,126
On K-PAX, we have two suns.

606
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,086
在K派斯，我们有两个太阳

607
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,189
每隔两百年会一块升起来

608
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,223
They rise together only once every 200 years.

609
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,393
非常的壮观

610
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,325
And that is quite a sight.

611
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,402
他肯定对白光敏感

612
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,436
He most definitely has a sensitivity to white light,

613
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:00,501
不过有趣的是他看到的范围

614
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:00,535
but I think it's his range that you'll find interesting.

615
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,477
什么意思？

616
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,477
What am I looking at?

617
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,608
他看得到高达四百埃的光波

618
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,643
He can detect light at a wavelength of up to 300 to 400 angstroms.

619
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,083
就是紫外线

620
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,616
<i>Ultraviolet.</i>

621
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,054
当然，波特的解释是

622
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,082
Of course, Prot's explanation is that...

623
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:17,527
他的星球有两个太阳 所以产生特殊的光

624
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:17,561
due to his planet's peculiar quality of light caused by its two suns,

625
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:23,090
K派斯人习惯的光线 比较像我们的微光

626
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:23,124
K-PAXians are used to light conditions much like our twilight most of the time.

627
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,463
等一下

628
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,192
W-Wait a minute. Chuck, I didn't think...

629
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,231
人类看不到紫外线

630
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,261
human beings could see ultraviolet light.

631
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,167
我们是看不到

632
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,204
We can't.

633
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,389
早安，乔伊斯 今天的外形好漂亮

634
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,419
Good morning, Joyce.

635
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,123
- That's a lovely configuration you're wearing today. - Thank you.

636
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,691
谢谢

637
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,824
百货公司买的         请进

638
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,699
- Macy's. - Come in.

639
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,872
这样好多了

640
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,906
This is so much better.

641
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,450
好像回家一样

642
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,484
It's a lot like home.

643
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,400
对了，波特

644
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,457
<i>Well, uh, Prot,</i>

645
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,402
我希望你多讲一些家乡的事情

646
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,934
<i>I was hoping you'd tell me more about home.</i>

647
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,739
你想知道什么？

648
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,774
Well, what would you like to know?

649
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,001
你在你们…

650
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,035
Well, uh, do you, um,

651
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,638
在你们K派斯有没有家庭

652
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,774
<i>do you have a family on K-PAX?</i>

653
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,480
马克，K派斯和这里不一样

654
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,517
It doesn't work on K-PAX the same way it works here, Mark.

655
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,818
我们没有你们印象中的家庭

656
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,852
On K-PAX, we don't have families in the way that you think of them.

657
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:56,383
在大部分星球 家庭已经失去了作用

658
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:56,417
In fact, a family would be a non sequitur on our planet, as it would on most others.

659
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,826
换言之

660
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,860
In other words, um,

661
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:04,664
你…从来不认识你的父母

662
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:04,698
you, uh, you never knew your parents.

663
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,102
在K派斯，小孩不是由 他们的亲生父母抚养

664
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,069
On K-PAX, children are not raised by their biological parents, Mark, but by everyone.

665
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,195
而是由每一个人

666
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,439
They circulate among us, learning from one and then another.

667
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,401
大家轮流抚养，由所有人教导

668
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,412
你有小孩吗？         没有

669
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,446
- Do you have a child? - No.

670
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,015
有太太在等你回去吗？

671
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,446
Do you have a wife waiting back for you on K-PAX?

672
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,083
马克…

673
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,078
Mark. Mark. Mark.

674
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,148
你根本没在听我说话

675
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,220
You are not really listening to what I'm saying to you, are you?

676
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,296
我们K派斯人没有婚姻

677
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,329
<i>We do not have marriage on K-PAX.</i>

678
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,797
没有太太，没有先生

679
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,797
<i>There are no wives. There are no husbands.</i>

680
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,562
也没有家庭

681
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,596
There are no families.

682
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,805
我明白了，那…

683
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,803
I see. So, um,

684
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,846
社会结构呢？

685
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,835
what about... societal structure?

686
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,438
有没有政府？         不需要

687
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,474
- Government. - No, there's no need for one.

688
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,881
你们没有法律？

689
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,646
- You have no laws? - No laws. No lawyers.

690
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,612
没有法律，没有律师

691
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,479
那怎么分辨对和错？

692
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,488
How do you know right from wrong?

693
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,326
宇宙每一个生物 都能分辨对和错

694
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,357
Every being in the universe knows right from wrong, Mark.

695
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,332
可是万一…

696
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,865
But what if...

697
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,869
有人做错了事

698
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,891
if someone did do something wrong...

699
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,306
杀人，甚至强奸 怎么处罚他们

700
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,667
committed murder or rape...

701
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,640
how would you punish them?

702
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,044
马克，让我告诉你

703
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,081
Let me tell you something, Mark.

704
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,743
你们人类，大多数的人

705
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,777
You humans, most of you,

706
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,581
赞同“以牙还牙，一命还一命”

707
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,615
subscribe to this policy of "an eye for an eye...

708
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,088

00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,122
<i>a life for a life, '" which is known throughout the universe...</i>

710
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,090
都认为是愚蠢的

711
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,124
<i>for its stupidity.</i>

712
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,558
连你们的佛祖和耶稣都反对

713
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,752
Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision,

714
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,652
可是连他们的教徒

715
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,594
but nobody's paid much attention to them, not even the Buddhists or the Christians.

716
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,857
都把他们的话当耳边风

717
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,829
[Sighs] You humans,

718
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,999

719

真不明白你们 怎么有办法活到现在

720
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,340
sometimes it's hard to imagine how you've made it this far.

<i>[Swing Creaking]</i>

Hey. Where were you just now?

Hey, kids, come on. Wash up.

745
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,425
- Not too bad. - We even stopped by to see Michael.

746
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,396
我们顺便去看迈克尔

麻烦你们了，妹妹

Oh, that was nice of you, Sis.

749
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,791
绕那么一大段路

750
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,791
Quite a detour for you guys.

751
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,097
刚好是他生日

752
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,803
Well, it was his birthday.

753
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,673
我知道他过生日

754
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,699
I know it was his birthday.

755
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,572
我照例寄了一张卡片…

756
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,607
I sent him a card and a nice, uh,

757
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,611
和一张支票过去

758
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,611
a nice, big check as usual.

759
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,681
偶尔打通电话给你儿子

760
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,705
It wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone every once in a while...

761
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,682
不是那么难吧

762
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,716

谢了，麻烦把马铃薯沙拉给我

764

Thank you, Abby. You wanna pass the potato salad, please?

765
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,754
你的沙拉

766

是我供他上的大学

768
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,290
By the way, I put him through Dartmouth. He knows how to pick up a phone too.

769
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,292
他为什么不打给我

770
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,761
我想请他来过圣诞节

771
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,296
- I'm thinking of inviting him for Christmas. - Oh, great.

772
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:24,324
他圣诞节要跟他妈过 他不会来的

773
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,765
He spends Christmas with his mother.

774
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,802
你怎么知道 你什么时候问过他了？

775
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,800
<i>- He won't come here. - How do you know? When was the last time you asked him?</i>

779
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,834
- You want a beer? - Please and thank you.

780
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,378
还要吗？         给我一根玉米

781
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,844
- You want some more? - Can I have corn, darling?

782
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,745
史蒂夫，我…

783
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,779
Steve, I, uh,

784
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,515
我想请你帮个忙

785
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,321
I have a rather unusual favor to ask you.

786
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,988
什么忙？         我有个病人

787
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,983
- What can I do you for, Dr. "P"? - Well, I have a patient.

788
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,890
坐，这个病人他…

789
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,925
Sit down. I have this patient, who, uh,

790
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,894
对你那行非常有研究

791
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,928
seems to know quite a bit about your field.

792
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,327
你的病人是天文学家？

793
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,486
A patient who's an astronomer?

794
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,128
他是个怎样的人

795
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,129
<i>So, tell me about this patient of yours.</i>

796
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:02,229
他自称，来自一个 叫K派斯的星球

797
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:02,265
<i>Well, he, uh, he claims to come from a planet he calls K-PAX.</i>

798
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,808
好奇怪的名字         K派斯？

799
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,831
- What kind of name is that? - K-PAX?

800
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:10,245
说是在天琴座附近 距离地球一千光年

801
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:10,279
He says it's a thousand light-years away, near the constellation Lyra.

802
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,813
大头、绿皮肤，大概这么高

803
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,806
<i>Uh-huh. Big head? Green? About this high?</i>

804
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,044
我想我认识他

805
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,375
<i>Yeah, I think I know the guy.</i>

806
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,017
不，他说得煞有介事

807
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,988
No, he's, uh, he's very convincing.

808
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,756
当然，他是人类

809
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:27,126
[Laughs] I mean, of course, he's, uh, he's human.

810
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,765
只是他…

811
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,792
It's just that he's, um,

812
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,065
是我碰过最有说服力 的妄想症病人

813
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,065
<i>well, he's-he's the most convincing delusional I've ever come across.</i>

814
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,740
要是我能向他证明 K派斯根本不存在

815
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,700
If I can prove to him that this K-PAX is just a figment of his imagination,

816
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,936
也许我就能查出他真正的身份

817
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,973
then maybe I can find out who he really is.

818
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:45,141
我可以列出一张问题让他回答

819
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,343
<i>Well, sure. I can give you...</i>

820
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,509
- a whole list of questions to ask your fella. - Wonderful.

821
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,478
好极了

822
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,154
他的书和报纸

823
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,177
<i>[Betty] All his books and papers and everything...</i>

824
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:56,751
照样摊在桌上，他只是呆坐着

825
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:56,250
are spread all over the desk like always, but he's just sitting there.

826
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,260
有人改了他的药

827
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,261
Someone change his medication?

828
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:02,197
我还是给他 二百五十毫克的镇定剂

829
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,231
I gave him his usual, Anafronil, 250 milligrams.

830
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,733
他不太对劲

831
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,763
<i>[Dr. Powell] Hmm. Well, something's wrong with him.</i>

832
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:14,801
强迫性精神病患 不会呆坐看着窗外

833
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:14,877
An obsessive-compulsive doesn't just sit there looking out the window.

834
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,182
豪伊？

835
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,222
Howie?

836
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,619
早上好，鲍威尔医生

837
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,596
Good morning, Dr. Powell.

838
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,300
早啊，你…在找什么

839
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,062
Good morning. But are you looking for something?

840
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,029
青鸟

841
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,069
Bluebird.

842
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,199
青鸟？

843
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,230
The bluebird?

844
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,501
象征幸福的青鸟

845
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,240
The bluebird of happiness.

846
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,672
波特叫我找幸福的青鸟

847
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,712
Prot told me to find the bluebird of happiness.

848
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,682
波特叫你找的

849
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,138
Prot told you.

850
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,478
是一项任务

851
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,483
It's a task.

852
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,614
三项任务之一

853
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,485
The first of three.

854
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,456
我不知道其他两项是什么

855
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,289
I don't know what the other two are yet.

856
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,026
他会告诉我

857
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,724
He'll tell me.

858
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:07,188
我完成三项任务

859
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,654
If I complete all three,

860
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,129
我的病就会好

861
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,166
I'll be cured.

862
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,076
好，继续呼吸

863
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,105
<i>[Prot] There. Maintain your breathing.</i>

864
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,650
对了，你看

865
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,650
That's it. Now you see?

866
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,743
哪有什么阿摩尼亚微粒

867
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,186
There are none of these ammonia particles that you're so worried about.

868
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:33,984
有我早就看到了，可是我没有

869
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,314
- In the first place, I would be able to see them. - Good morning, Sal.

870
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,324
<i>- And I don't. - [Sal] Good morning, Dr. Stinky.</i>

871
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,925
飞猴出现，七点钟方向

872
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,952
Ringed monkey, 7:00.

873
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,297
洗澡，洗澡

874
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,366
Take a bath. Take a bath.

875
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,962
恩尼，我有事找他谈

876
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,961
- Ernie, could you excuse us for a moment, please? - Mm-hmm.

877
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,936
你出来我很高兴

878
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,972
Good to, uh, see you outside, Ernie.

879
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,237
谢谢         恩尼，你好臭

880
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,271
- Thank you. - Oh, Ernie, you stink.

881
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,642
波特，关心病人是一回事

882
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,676
<i>Prot, it's one thing to take an interest in your fellow patients.</i>

883
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,739
说你能治好他们是另外一回事

884
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,773
It's quite another to make them think that you can cure them.

885
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,841
你太紧张了

886
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,841
You seem overly upset, Mark.

887
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,444
套句纳罗的话，放轻松

888
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,480
To borrow a phrase from Navarro, you need to chill.

889
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,752
凡是生物都有治愈自我的能力

890
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,991
For your information, all beings have the capacity to cure themselves, Mark.

891
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,521
K派斯人几百万年前就知道了

892
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,586
This is something we've known on K-PAX for millions of years.

893
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,826
听我说，在地球上 我是医生，你是病人

894
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,826
Listen to me. On this planet, I'm a doctor, you're a patient.

895
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,825
医生、病人，奇怪的区别

896
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,733
Doctor. Patient. Curious human distinction.

897
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,804
我的工作是治好豪伊

898
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,772
It's not your job to cure Howie.

899
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,807
恩尼、玛丽亚，还有其他人 不是你的工作

900
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,831
Or Ernie or Maria or anyone else. It's mine.

901
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,002
那你为什么还没治好他们呢？

902
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,036
Then why haven't you cured them yet?

903
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,709
还有，我回答了你给我的问题

904
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:33,743
Oh, by the way, here are the answers to the questions you asked me.

905
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,680
希望你满意

906
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,555
I hope they meet your satisfaction.

907
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,137
我不知道要说什么

908
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,171
<i>[Russell] I don't know what to say, Mark.</i>

909
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,936
这实在是…太夸张了

910
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,970
I mean, this is... this is pretty wild stuff.

911
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,070
他乱答一通？         不算乱答

912
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,070
- Gibberish, huh? - Well, not exactly.

913
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,411
我是说…

914
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,445
I mean, see,

915
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,417
你的病人说他的星球K派斯

916
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,417
your patient indicates his planet, K-PAX,

917
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,478
环绕着双子星系的轨道运行

918
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,513
<i>orbiting an eclipsing binary star system...Agape and Satori.</i>

919
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,354
对         靠近天琴座

920
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,388
<i>- Yeah. - Near the Constellation Lyra.</i>

921
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,553
这可以从书上查到，对不对

922
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,587
He could have looked that up, right?

923
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,756
怪就怪在不可以

924
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,756
That's the funny thing, Mark. Not really.

925
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,734
我是说 除了我的上司，邓肯弗林

926
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,735
I mean, except for my boss, Duncan Flynn,

927
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,670
他是全球首屈一指的天文学家

928
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,704
one of the foremost astrophysicists in the world...

929
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:33,107
还有他两、三位同事之外

930
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:33,142
and maybe two or three of his colleagues,

931
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,476
就没人了解这方面的事了

932
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,510
nobody knows much about the possibility of planets in this star system yet.

933
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,015
期刊上面也没报导过

934
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,049
It hasn't even been reported in any journals.

935
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,946
老实告诉我

936
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,616
<i>Tell me, honestly,</i>

937
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,022
邓肯是不是在搞鬼

938
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,046
did Duncan put you up to this?

939
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,320
叫你来…跟我开玩笑

940
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,785
You know... You know, like a joke?

941
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:51,589
绝对不是开玩笑

942
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,590
[Chuckles] No. It's no joke, Steve.

943
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,891
告诉我

944
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,926
Uh, tell me,

945
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,263
是不是有什么 天体物理学家失踪了

946
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,297
do you know of any missing astrophysicists?

947
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,860
- [Laughs] Can't say I do. - [Chuckles]

948
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,838
应该没有

949
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,537
不过有几位专家想见你的病人

950
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,567
But there's one or two around here who'd sure like to meet this fella of yours.

951
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,167
史蒂夫，谢谢你帮忙

952
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,167
Thanks a lot, Steve. I sure appreciate it.

953
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,611
<i>[Rachel] ? B, A, D, C, B, C, D??</i>

954

961
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,793
[Prot On tape] It's a pain...

- [Chuckles] - Yes, well,

1008
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,952
从光束旅行开始好了

1009
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,988
let's start with this idea of light travel, shall we?

1010
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,590
关于这方面，你有什么要说的

1011
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,665
What can you tell us about that?

1012
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,536
什么都没有

1013
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,570
Absolutely nothing.

1014
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,069
说出来，你们会炸死自己

1015
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,130
<i>If I told you, you'd blow yourselves up.</i>

1016
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,142
甚至炸死别人

1017
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,175
<i>Or worse, someone else.</i>

1018
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,303
光束包含的能量大到让你吃惊

1019
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,337
You'd be surprised how much energy is in a beam of light.

1020
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,541
Hmm. Well, then,

1021
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:43,315
也许你可以表演一下 你所谓的光束旅行

1022
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:43,280
maybe you could show us how this light travel works.

1023
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,088
你希望我示范

1024
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,091
You mean a demonstration.

1025

Do bluebirds bite, Sal?

1143
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,738
不会，它们不会咬人，臭头

Nah, they don't bite, stinkhead.

I was wondering if maybe you could show me how to do that.

I wanna get out, if you know what I mean.

1210
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,726
我以前在广场酒店看门

1211
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,760
I used the be the doorman at the Plaza.

1212

F-Fifteen years.

1214
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,435
That's when I started to notice it.

1215
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,009
注意到什么？         臭味

1216
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:33,007
- Notice what? - The smell.

1217
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,340
他们都很臭

1218
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,408
They all stank.

1219
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,811
我试着告诉他们…

1220
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:40,007
L-I tried to tell 'em, but, uh,

1221
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,415
结果被送了进来

1222
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,449
they put me here.

1223
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,987
而且…

1224
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,010
And, um, and-and...

1225
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,787
最臭的地方是这里

1226
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,821
And this-this place smells worse than all.

1227
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,556
只有你，你不臭

1228
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,590
Except for you. Y-You don't smell,

1229
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,827
所以我想你也许能帮我

1230
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,861
so I figured maybe you could help me.

1231
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,502
在我的星球，约克的芬芳

1232
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:03,435
You should smell the york blossoms on my planet...

in a gentle breeze.

1235
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,312
就像你们的蜜李

1236
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,334
Pretty much like your sugarplums.

1237
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,348
我想去闻闻看

1238
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,382
I would... I would like to smell that.

1239
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:18,753
我想去你的…

1240
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:18,650
I would like to go there, to-to your, um,

00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,656
planet.

1243
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,820
我只能带一个人跟我回去

1244
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,854
I'm afraid I can only take one person back with me when I go.

1245
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:32,298
我今天替赛尔做心理咨询

1246
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,333
Uh, I had my weekly session with Sal today.

1247
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,302
他说你要带他回K派斯

1248
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,336
He says you're taking him to K-PAX.

1249
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:37,336
这些话我早就听 二楼的病人说过

1250
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,339
In fact, I've heard from most of the patients on ward two,

1251
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,966
他们都跟我说要去K派斯

1252
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,171
they all tell me that they're going to K-PAX.

1253
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,238
这样承诺病人明智吗？

1254
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,735
I wonder if that's a wise thing to be promising patients in a psychiatric facility.

1255
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:43,836
尤其是精神病患

1256
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,908
No, no, no, Mark. I made it clear to each and every one of them,

1257
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:44,938
你错了，马克

1258
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,879
无论对谁，我都清楚表明

1259
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,714
只能带一个人跟我回去

1260
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,714
I can only take one person back with me when I return.

1261
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,653
回去？         不要误会

1262
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,687
- Return? - Mark, don't get me wrong.

1263
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,623
你是对我非常好

1264
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,657
I mean, you've been very hospitable.

1265
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,752
医者父母心

1266
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,786
Hospital. Hospitable.

1267
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,763
不过时间到了，我不走不行

1268
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:02,457
- But my time here is almost up, and I can't wait to get back. - Back?

1269
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,924
走？回K派斯？

1270
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:05,092
- To K-PAX? - Yes, of course. Where else?

1271
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,093
当然，还有哪里

1272
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,136
You're planning to return to K-PAX.

1273
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,102
你打算回K派斯？

1274
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:10,401
你又在重复我的话 我会先北上

1275
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:10,469
You're repeating yourself again, Mark. Yes, I have one trip to take up north,

1276
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,998
然后再回K派斯

1277
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,031
and then I am planning on returning to K-PAX.

1278
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,772
乔伊斯给我她自己种的草莓

1279
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,806
Joyce gave me these strawberries this morning from her garden in Hoboken.

1280
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,176
好好吃

1281
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,315
- They're delicious. - You'll have to forgive me, but, um,

1282
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,306
对不起，可是…

1283
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,611
我被你弄糊涂了

1284
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,613
but this is a bit confusing.

1285
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,744
你打算什么时候… 我7月27日走

1286
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,745
- When are you planning on... - I'm departing on July 27.

1287
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,985
为什么选7月27日？

1288
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:28,985
Why? Why, uh, why July 27?

1289
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,923
基于安全考量

1290
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,993
Safety reasons.

1291
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,462
我在地球上用超光速旅行

1292
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,859
You see, I can go anywhere on Earth without fear of bumping into someone...

1293
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,030
不会撞到别人

1294
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,991
traveling at super light speed, but beings are coming and going all the time from K-PAX.

1295
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,999
K派斯上来来去去都用超光速

1296
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,399
必须事先安排好

1297
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,434
It has to be coordinated.

1298
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,673
你是说…

1299
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,473
You're telling me...

1300
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,370
你7月27日要坐光束回去？

1301
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,409
you're beaming back to K-PAX on July 27.

- Go back to bed, honey. - Where is Daddy going?

1316
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,022
没去哪儿，他只是肚子痛

1317
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,022
Daddy's all right. He has a tummyache. He's all right.

1318

1336
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,474

What is... What is this patient doing to you?

1344
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,685
他暗示我五年前的7月27日

1345
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,685
He's telling me that five years ago on July 27...

1346
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,659
他遇到一件不幸的事情

- [Groans] - Why, is he going to zap us with his laser gun?

他会不会用雷射枪射我们

01:01:35,539 --> 01:01:38,838
<i>- [Panting] - Prot?</i>

1599
01:01:42,347 --> 01:01:44,247
没事了

1600
01:01:42,346 --> 01:01:44,280
You're okay.

1601
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,884
[Sniffing]

1602
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:49,853
我闻到苹果馅饼的味道

1603
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:49,886
Is that apple pie I smell?

1604
01:01:59,364 --> 01:02:01,855
女儿，你没事吧         没事

1605
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:01,854
- Sweetheart, you all right? - Yeah.

1606
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:06,301
他推我女儿荡秋千 样子很熟练

1607
01:02:01,932 --> 01:02:06,266
He was pushing my daughter on a swing, like he had done a hundred times before.

1608
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:10,501
不像来自K派斯的外星人

1609
01:02:06,337 --> 01:02:09,329
Not like he was some alien from K-PAX.

1610
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:14,136
我看得出来，他想起一些事情

1611
01:02:10,574 --> 01:02:14,135
I saw him. He was connecting with something.

1612
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:15,577
像是正常的生活

1613
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:16,679
- Some kind of normal life. - That's not enough.

1614
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:16,636
那样不够

1615
01:02:16,747 --> 01:02:18,681
He's a violent patient, Mark.

1616
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:18,181
他有暴力倾向

1617
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,911
他没有暴力倾向

1618
01:02:18,749 --> 01:02:21,013
He's not violent.

1619
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,353
他曾经遇到过暴力意外

1620
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:24,350
Something violent happened to him. Something in his past.

1621
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:26,651
他抓住纳塔莉，不是想伤害她

1622
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:28,050
When he was going after Natalie, he wasn't trying to harm her, he was trying to protect her.

1623
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:27,986
是想保护她

1624
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:32,255
- From the sprinklers? - I'm not sure from what.

1625
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:29,387
因为洒水器？

1626
01:02:30,095 --> 01:02:32,188
我不确定是什么原因

1627
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:36,529
我需要实际的资料 否则我只能送他上楼

1628
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:36,561
I need more than a hunch to go on, otherwise I have to send him upstairs.

1629
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:39,468
我们要回溯他的过去

1630
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:39,535
We need to regress him... take him back into the past,

1631
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:42,233
让他面对过去的事

1632
01:02:39,603 --> 01:02:42,299
find out what happened and have him confront it.

1633
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,273
回溯过去

1634
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:47,037
Regress him? Do you have any idea how risky it is to regress a patient like this one?

1635
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,936
你知不知道那样做有多危险

1636
01:02:48,013 --> 01:02:49,412
那是他唯一的机会

1637
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:49,443
It's his only chance.

1638
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:52,347
我们要逼他，时间不多了

1639
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:52,414
Claudia, we have to push him. There's no time.

1640
01:02:52,451 --> 01:02:55,181
他说7月27日要回K派斯去

1641
01:02:52,483 --> 01:02:55,247
He told me that he's going back to K-PAX on July 27.

1642
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:57,448
就是三个礼拜以后

1643
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:57,014
That's in three weeks.

1644
01:02:57,556 --> 01:03:02,255
我认为到那天他会变得暴戾 伤害自己，也伤害别人

1645
01:02:57,588 --> 01:03:02,287
I think that he could become violent on that day. Hurt himself, somebody else.

1646
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,921
你知道问题出在哪儿

1647
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:04,953
You know what the problem is, Mark.

1648
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:09,494
你跟病人太接近了 只有你自己看不出来

1649
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:06,724
You're too close to this patient.

1650
01:03:06,797 --> 01:03:09,561
<i>Everybody else can see it but you.</i>

1651
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,933
我决定把他转到四楼去

1652
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:12,466
I am transferring him to the fourth floor, and that's final.

1653
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:15,598
我知道我太接近他，我承认

1654
01:03:12,536 --> 01:03:15,664
I know I'm too close to him. All right, fine. I admit it.

1655
01:03:15,707 --> 01:03:17,641
为什么你选择拯救他？

1656
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:17,673
Why choose this one to save, Mark?

1657
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:22,510
我不知道，也许因为我觉得…

1658
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:22,542
I don't know. Maybe... Maybe because I feel...

1659
01:03:22,614 --> 01:03:24,514
他选择了我

1660
01:03:22,613 --> 01:03:24,547
he chose me.

1661
01:03:31,223 --> 01:03:33,088
有没有人看到波特？

1662
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:33,155
<i>Has anyone seen Prot?</i>

1663
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:37,589
他有事北上几天

1664
01:03:34,925 --> 01:03:37,621
He went up north for a few days.

1665
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:39,687
北上？

1666
01:03:37,695 --> 01:03:41,461
<i>- "North"? - [Howie] Greenland.</i>

1667
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:41,390
格陵兰

1668
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,434
冰岛

1669
01:03:41,532 --> 01:03:43,466
Iceland.

1670
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:45,730
你知道

1671
01:03:43,534 --> 01:03:44,592
You know.

1672
01:03:45,837 --> 01:03:49,705
为了写报告 他需要去几个国家

1673
01:03:45,836 --> 01:03:49,772
He had a few countries left to visit before he could finish his report.

1674
01:03:50,575 --> 01:03:52,668
别担心，他会回来的

1675
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:52,768
Don't worry, Dr. Powell. He'll be back.

1676
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:55,611
你怎么知道？

1677
01:03:52,843 --> 01:03:54,868
How do you know, Ernie?

1678
01:03:55,714 --> 01:03:57,807
因为他带了他的太阳眼镜

1679
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:57,873
Because he took his glasses with him, darling.

1680
01:03:57,916 --> 01:04:00,476
他要是回K派斯就不会带了

1681
01:03:57,948 --> 01:04:00,542
When he returns to K-PAX, he won't need them.

1682
01:04:09,394 --> 01:04:13,194
病人不可能逃走 也不可以逃走

1683
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,852
[Sighs]

1684
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:13,260
Patients do not escape from this institution. They don't escape.

1685
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:15,323
他未必是逃走

1686
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,389
There has been no evidence of escape,

1687
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:18,426
不过我已经知会警方、社工

1688
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:18,526
but obviously, I've notified the police, social services.

1689
01:04:18,537 --> 01:04:21,631
我怎么向医管局解释

1690
01:04:18,602 --> 01:04:21,696
I'm gonna have a great time explaining this to the state board.

1691
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:24,334
难不成说四楼的病人 全都打好行李

1692
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:23,933
I got psychotics on the fourth floor packing up their sneakers...

1693
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,810
准备去K派斯，把他找回来

1694
01:04:24,008 --> 01:04:25,942
because they all think they're going off to K-PAX.

1695
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,944
<i>- Claudia... - Find him.</i>

1696
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,454
那市立收容所呢？

1697
01:04:34,585 --> 01:04:37,554
<i>[Dr. Powell] Well, what about city shelters?</i>

1698
01:04:37,556 --> 01:04:40,457
你有没有查过？

1699
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:40,556
Have you... Have you checked?

1700
01:04:42,494 --> 01:04:44,394
不是

1701
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:43,148
No.

1702
01:04:44,496 --> 01:04:47,988
我不是在打你官腔

1703
01:04:44,528 --> 01:04:48,055
No, I'm not telling you how to do your job.

1704
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,830
谢谢你

1705
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:50,896
Uh... thank... thank you.

1706
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,154
[Sighs]

1707
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:15,191
[Sighs]

1708
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:35,940
[Mutters]

1709
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,280
想必是鲍威尔医生吧

1710
01:05:41,185 --> 01:05:43,380
Dr. Powell, I presume.

1711
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:46,253
你跑哪儿去了？

1712
01:05:43,454 --> 01:05:46,048
Where the hell have you been?

1713
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:49,350
纽芬兰、格陵兰 冰岛、拉布拉多…

1714
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:49,456
Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, uh, Labrador...

1715
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:52,897
少废话，我们找了你三天

1716
01:05:49,526 --> 01:05:52,962
All right, cut the crap. We've been looking for you for three days.

1717
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:56,525
我记得在这个花园 跟你提过要北上的事

1718
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,625
I believe I mentioned my taking a trip up north, Mark, in this very garden.

1719
01:05:56,668 --> 01:06:00,468
你是病人 未经批准不可以外出

1720
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,759
"Taking a trip"? You're a patient here.

1721
01:05:58,836 --> 01:06:02,704
You don't leave here without a discharge. And don't give me this beam-of-light shit,

1722
01:06:00,605 --> 01:06:04,268
少拿什么狗屁光束来唬我 我才不信

1723
01:06:02,773 --> 01:06:03,967
<i>because I don't buy it.</i>

1724
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,070
要是我告诉你…

1725
01:06:07,111 --> 01:06:09,079
What would you say if I were to tell you...

1726
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:13,311
我不相信你去过那些地方 你会怎样？

1727
01:06:09,146 --> 01:06:11,341
that I don't believe you took any trip at all...

1728
01:06:11,415 --> 01:06:13,349
to Iceland or Greenland or anywhere?

1729
01:06:14,186 --> 01:06:17,485
我不相信你来自K派斯

1730
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:17,513
That I don't believe you're from K-PAX?

1731
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:20,420
我认为你跟我一样是人

1732
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:20,455
<i>I believe you're as human as I am.</i>

1733
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:23,289
我会认为你需要注射镇定剂

1734
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:23,357
I would say you're in need of a thorazine drip, Doctor.

1735
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:31,366
有一个办法

1736
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:30,932
Well, there... there is one way...

1737
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:34,166
你可以说服我

1738
01:06:31,502 --> 01:06:34,232
you could convince me beyond any doubt.

1739
01:06:34,272 --> 01:06:36,740
当然，我需要徵求你的同意

1740
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:36,772
Of course, I would need your consent.

1741
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:38,707
就是催眠

1742
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,774
It's called hypnosis.

1743
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:40,539
我看不出有什么用

1744
01:06:38,842 --> 01:06:42,471
<i>- I just don't see the point. - Let me tell you what your alternative is.</i>

1745
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:42,443
那你还有一个选择

1746
01:06:42,547 --> 01:06:45,948
就是转到另外一层楼 每天打针

1747
01:06:42,546 --> 01:06:45,982
A trip to a place where they'll stick a needle in your ass every morning,

1748
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:48,576
打到你只会傻笑

1749
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:48,108
which may or may not leave you with a stupid grin on your face...

1750
01:06:48,687 --> 01:06:52,987
一直笑到你离开地球为止 你希望那样吗？

1751
01:06:48,185 --> 01:06:50,119
for the rest of your days here on Earth.

1752
01:06:50,187 --> 01:06:52,553
<i>Is that what you'd like?</i>

1753
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:57,421
波特，我想帮你

1754
01:06:53,123 --> 01:06:54,147
Prot?

1755
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:57,493
I want to help you.

1756
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:05,197
我们现在要做的 有点像在做白日梦

1757
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:05,230
<i>What we're going to be doing, Prot, is a bit like daydreaming.</i>

1758
01:07:05,303 --> 01:07:08,204
我会从一数到五

1759
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:08,237
I'm gonna count from one to five.

1760
01:07:08,306 --> 01:07:11,207
数到三，你会闭上眼睛

1761
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:11,240
On the count of three, your eyes will close,

1762
01:07:11,309 --> 01:07:13,777
进入非常深

1763
01:07:11,308 --> 01:07:13,833
and you will find yourself in a very nice, deep,

1764
01:07:13,879 --> 01:07:16,814
非常舒服的催眠状态

1765
01:07:13,911 --> 01:07:16,846
comfortable, relaxed state of hypnosis.

1766
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:23,213
一，你的眼皮开始变重

1767
01:07:18,582 --> 01:07:23,952
One. Your eyes are starting to get very heavy now.

1768
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:27,591
二，我要你发挥想像力

1769
01:07:25,222 --> 01:07:27,622
Two. I want you to use your imagination...

1770
01:07:27,692 --> 01:07:31,924
想像你的眼皮上有铅块

1771
01:07:27,691 --> 01:07:31,991
and imagine small lead weights on your eyelids...

1772
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:36,626
变得非常沉重

1773
01:07:32,062 --> 01:07:36,726
that are just making them so... heavy.

1774
01:07:37,269 --> 01:07:38,759
脉搏每分钟40下         三

1775
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,825
<i>- [Dr. Chakraborty] Pulse rate is 40 B.P.M. - Three.</i>

1776
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,770
继续闭着眼睛 还好他不是人类

1777
01:07:38,902 --> 01:07:40,836
<i>- Keep your eyes closed. - I'd be concerned if he were human.</i>

1778
01:07:40,872 --> 01:07:45,741
放松自己，尽量放松

1779
01:07:40,904 --> 01:07:45,773
<i>Let yourself go way, way down deep.</i>

1780
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:50,838
四，全身开始放松

1781
01:07:45,842 --> 01:07:50,836
Four. Let a wave of relaxation move through your body now...

1782
01:07:50,949 --> 01:07:53,816
你现在睡得更熟

1783
01:07:50,914 --> 01:07:53,883
<i>as you go down even deeper.</i>

1784
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:55,944
五

1785
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:55,976
<i>And five,</i>

1786
01:07:56,054 --> 01:08:01,117
睡得非常、非常熟

1787
01:07:56,053 --> 01:08:01,184
<i>going way, way down deep.</i>

1788
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:04,490
你现在处于放松的催眠状态

1789
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:04,557
You are in a relaxed state of hypnosis now.

1790
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:07,564
感觉如何？

1791
01:08:05,629 --> 01:08:07,563
<i>How do you feel?</i>

1792
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:09,565
[Chuckles]

1793
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:12,195
像…

1794
01:08:09,633 --> 01:08:10,725
Like...

1795
01:08:12,304 --> 01:08:14,169
没感觉

1796
01:08:12,302 --> 01:08:14,065
nothing.

1797
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:17,971
我要你回到过去

1798
01:08:15,305 --> 01:08:18,035
I want you to go back in time.

1799
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:24,008
我要你回忆起最早的经验

1800
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:24,779
<i>I want you to recall the first experience that you can remember.</i>

1801
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,742
你看到什么？

1802
01:08:24,848 --> 01:08:26,782
What do you see?

1803
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:31,320
怎么了？

1804
01:08:28,418 --> 01:08:30,352
<i>[Dr. Powell On Speaker] What was that?</i>

1805
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,625
你看到什么？

1806
01:08:32,723 --> 01:08:34,657
<i>What do you see?</i>

1807
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:41,263
Uh...

1808
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:45,229
我看到

1809
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:45,363
[Child-Like Voice] I see...

1810
01:08:45,337 --> 01:08:47,328
棺材

1811
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:47,369
casket.

1812
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,974
银色的

1813
01:08:49,139 --> 01:08:51,073
Silver...

1814
01:08:53,178 --> 01:08:54,577
衬里是蓝色的

1815
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:54,643
with a blue lining.

1816
01:08:56,248 --> 01:08:58,375
是谁的棺材？

1817
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,441
Whose casket is it?

1818
01:09:00,852 --> 01:09:03,912
我朋友爸爸的

1819
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,977
It's the father of a friend of mine.

1820
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:06,480
你朋友叫什么名字？

1821
01:09:04,054 --> 01:09:06,579
What's your friend's name?

1822
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,093
不告诉你

1823
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:10,150
I'm not telling.

1824
01:09:12,197 --> 01:09:15,758
知道他父亲为什么过世吗？

1825
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:15,824
Do you know how your friend's father died?

1826
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:21,297
他工作的时候出了意外

1827
01:09:18,135 --> 01:09:21,332
He had an accident at the place that he worked at.

1828
01:09:21,406 --> 01:09:23,237
他是意外死的？

1829
01:09:21,405 --> 01:09:23,805
He was killed in an accident?

1830
01:09:24,342 --> 01:09:28,369
是受伤太严重死的

1831
01:09:24,374 --> 01:09:27,935
<i>He... He was hurt and then died later?</i>

1832
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,243
他在哪儿工作？

1833
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:32,039
<i>- Where did he work? - The place where they kill cows.</i>

1834
01:09:30,315 --> 01:09:32,010
宰牛的地方

1835
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:33,982
那个地方在哪儿？

1836
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:34,049
Where is this place?

1837
01:09:37,889 --> 01:09:39,948
他的脉搏上升了10下

1838
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,984
<i>- The pulse ratejust shot up ten B.P.M.s. - [Beeping]</i>

1839
01:09:40,492 --> 01:09:44,826
知不知道…那个地方在哪儿？

1840
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:44,892
Do you know... Do you know where this place is?

1841
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:53,398
我要你放松

1842
01:09:50,233 --> 01:09:52,394
L-I want you to relax.

1843
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:56,531
我要你把时间往前移

1844
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:56,563
<i>I want to move forward in time now.</i>

1845
01:10:00,245 --> 01:10:01,610
你在哪儿？

1846
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,639
Where are you?

1847
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:05,508
是晚上

1848
01:10:02,913 --> 01:10:05,040
It's nighttime.

1849
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:07,482
我们在他家

1850
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:07,549
We're in his house.

1851
01:10:07,585 --> 01:10:10,850
另外一个男孩的家         对

1852
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:10,916
<i>- At the other boy's house? - Yeah.</i>

1853
01:10:10,955 --> 01:10:15,085
我找他出来         为什么？

1854
01:10:10,987 --> 01:10:12,921
I want him to come outside.

1855
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:15,150
Why?

1856
01:10:19,064 --> 01:10:21,328
看星星

1857
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:21,360
To look at the stars.

1858
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:25,463
我是从那里来的

1859
01:10:22,766 --> 01:10:25,496
That's where I come from, you know.

1860
01:10:27,605 --> 01:10:29,470
你是不是叫波特？

1861
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:29,505
Is your name Prot?

1862
01:10:32,243 --> 01:10:36,304
哇，你怎么知道

1863
01:10:32,209 --> 01:10:34,143
Wow.

1864
01:10:34,211 --> 01:10:36,338
How did you know that?

1865
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:38,812
你是从哪儿来的？

1866
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:38,881
Where are you from, Prot?

1867
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:43,117
我来自K派斯星

1868
01:10:40,817 --> 01:10:43,149
I'm from the planet K-PAX.

1869
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:45,416
在天琴座附近

1870
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,450
It's in the constellation Lyra.

1871
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,156
你认识所有的星座

1872
01:10:45,522 --> 01:10:48,184
Do you know all the constellations?

1873
01:10:48,727 --> 01:10:51,218
认识大部分

1874
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:51,250
[Chuckles] Yeah. Most of'em.

1875
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:55,026
你朋友也认识         他也认识

1876
01:10:51,328 --> 01:10:55,059
<i>- And does your friend know them too? - Yes, he does.</i>

1877
01:10:55,133 --> 01:10:58,261
他爸爸在家养病的时候 买了一副望远镜

1878
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:58,329
When his dad got sick and had to stay home, they got a telescope,

1879
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:02,397
教他辨认所有的星座

1880
01:10:58,402 --> 01:11:02,429
and his dad taught him about all the constellations.

1881
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:07,708
不过他现在没心情看

1882
01:11:04,441 --> 01:11:07,774
But he's not interested in those right now.

1883
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:10,178
为什么？

1884
01:11:07,844 --> 01:11:09,744
Why not?

1885
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:14,507
出事了，所以他叫我来

1886
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,108
Something happened.

1887
01:11:13,183 --> 01:11:16,209
That's why he called me.

1888
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:18,983
每次一出事，他就叫我来

1889
01:11:16,286 --> 01:11:19,050
He calls me when something bad happens.

1890
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:20,990
像是他父亲过世

1891
01:11:19,122 --> 01:11:21,056
Like when his father died?

1892
01:11:23,027 --> 01:11:24,858
没错

1893
01:11:23,026 --> 01:11:24,926
That's right.

1894
01:11:26,331 --> 01:11:29,789
你怎么知道要来？ 他怎么跟你联络

1895
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:29,830
How do you know to come? How does the boy call you?

1896
01:11:29,901 --> 01:11:33,894
我也不知道，我只知道我来了

1897
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,961
I don't know. I just come. I just... I just know.

1898
01:11:34,472 --> 01:11:35,996
你怎么来地球的？

1899
01:11:34,037 --> 01:11:36,062
How do you get to Earth?

1900
01:11:36,408 --> 01:11:39,639
我想出去，可不可以出去？

1901
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:39,666
I wanna go outside. Can I go outside?

1902
01:11:39,744 --> 01:11:41,644
马克，看他的身体语言

1903
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:41,677
Uh, read... read his body language, Mark.

1904
01:11:41,746 --> 01:11:44,271
他不想再说下去了

1905
01:11:41,745 --> 01:11:44,305
L-I don't think he wants to talk anymore today.

1906
01:11:44,382 --> 01:11:46,282
好吧，波特

1907
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:46,315
All right. Prot?

1908
01:11:46,384 --> 01:11:49,114
我要你放松

1909
01:11:46,383 --> 01:11:49,147
- I want you to just relax now. - [Shuddering]

1910
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,745
想着星星

1911
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:51,813
- Think about the stars. - [Whimpers]

1912
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:57,554
对了，我要从五倒数到一

1913
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:57,620
<i>That's right. I'm gonna count backwards now from five to one,</i>

1914
01:11:57,662 --> 01:12:01,063
你醒来的时候会非常有精神

1915
01:11:57,694 --> 01:12:01,095
and you'll find yourself wide-awake and refreshed.

1916
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:04,761
五，你现在开始醒过来

1917
01:12:01,164 --> 01:12:04,827
Five. You're starting to come out of it now.

1918
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:07,201
四，你越来越清醒

1919
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:07,267
<i>Four. You're feeling more alert.</i>

1920
01:12:07,305 --> 01:12:09,466
三，变得更清醒

1921
01:12:07,337 --> 01:12:09,498
<i>Three. Even more alert.</i>

1922
01:12:09,574 --> 01:12:12,099
二，你醒过来了

1923
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:12,201
<i>Two. You're becoming awake now.</i>

1924
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,178
一

1925
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:14,209
<i>And one.</i>

1926
01:12:18,817 --> 01:12:20,614
我们什么时候开始？

1927
01:12:18,715 --> 01:12:20,649
So when do we begin?

1928
01:12:20,985 --> 01:12:22,646
已经结束了

1929
01:12:20,717 --> 01:12:22,685
It's already over.

1930
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:30,086
哦，迅雷不及掩耳

1931
01:12:26,523 --> 01:12:30,118
Oh, the old "fastest gun in the West" routine, huh?

<i>[Slaps Knee]</i>

找出全美国屠宰场的地址

1934
01:12:36,633 --> 01:12:41,593
Let's find the locations of all the slaughterhouses operating in the United States.

1935
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:45,039
查查一共有多少家

1936
01:12:41,671 --> 01:12:45,038
I mean, how many can there be?

1937
01:12:45,143 --> 01:12:47,043
我不知道

1938
01:12:45,108 --> 01:12:47,042
I don't know.

1939
01:12:47,145 --> 01:12:50,808
不要找那些靠近大城市

1940
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:50,807
We eliminate, uh, the ones in or near big cities...

1941
01:12:50,915 --> 01:12:55,318
只要找小镇、乡村地区

1942
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:55,341
<i>and we concentrate on small towns, rural areas,</i>

1943
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:59,550
可以看到星星的地方

01:13:10,368 --> 01:13:13,064
在K派斯搞不好用不到

1951
01:13:10,133 --> 01:13:13,068
I suppose I won't really need it on K-PAX.

1952
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:16,197
我连他们喝什么都不知道

I don't even know what they drink. [Laughing]

你在做梦 他只带一个人跟他走

1955
01:13:16,273 --> 01:13:19,436
Dream on, sister. He can only take one of us with him.

1956
01:13:19,544 --> 01:13:23,537
你一身臭味，干嘛要带你 要带也带我

1957
01:13:19,509 --> 01:13:22,569
Why the hell would he take a stinker like you? He's taking me.

1958
01:13:23,648 --> 01:13:26,082
乱说，我不臭

01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:26,104
<i>How dare you! I do not stink.</i>

少做梦了，应该是我

1961
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:28,514
Nah, forget it, ho. I'm the one goin'.

1962
01:13:28,553 --> 01:13:30,953
是哦，哪一个你？

1963
01:13:28,585 --> 01:13:30,917
Yeah? Which one of you?

1964
01:13:31,055 --> 01:13:34,650
好，谁要先发言

1965
01:13:30,987 --> 01:13:34,684
<i>Okay. Who would like to begin?</i>

- Ernie. - Uh, l-I was... I was wondering if it was possible...

1968

可不可以不吃麦皮，改吃麦片

1969

- for us to have Cream of Wheat instead of oatmeal. - [All Groaning]

- Not again. - Howie.

<i>I have a suggestion, because there's really, really not much time.</i>

1974
01:13:47,705 --> 01:13:50,799
我建议举办作文比赛

1975
01:13:47,704 --> 01:13:50,867
I would like to propose an essay contest...

1976
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:54,572
来决定谁跟波特走

1977
01:13:50,941 --> 01:13:54,638
to decide once and for all who will go with Prot.

1978
01:13:54,679 --> 01:14:00,379
我跟他谈过 他答应在7月27日前看完

1979
01:13:54,711 --> 01:13:59,978
I've spoken with him, and he's agreed to read them all by July 27.

<i>Would I get to take my bible to K-PAX?</i>

Of course you would.

1993

Well, that's not his name, but whatever thrills you.

2018

Is there a problem?

<i>Is that why he called you?</i>

2032

[Sighs] He's got a girlfriend.

2034

<i>- And the problem is with the girlfriend? - She's pregnant.</i>

2036
01:15:41,452 --> 01:15:43,113
他可以想到会变成怎样

2037
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:44,045
He can see it all coming right down the road. You get married,

结婚、生子

<i>- He blames her for this? - Oh, no, no, no.</i>

他不怪她，他只是…

2044
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,825
He doesn't blame her. No, he just...

2045
01:15:53,865 --> 01:15:56,766
他…他是怎么说的

2046
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:56,832
He... How did he put it?

2047
01:15:56,868 --> 01:15:59,860
他不懂大家为什么要作茧自缚

2048
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,926
He hates the chains that people shackle themselves with.

2049
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:03,498
我们K派斯就没这种驴事 好了

2050
01:16:00,003 --> 01:16:02,233
I mean, we don't have all that crap on K-PAX.

2051
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:06,401
All right, Prot. I want you to listen to me carefully.

2052

我要你仔细听好

2053
01:16:06,978 --> 01:16:11,005
我要你把时间再往前移

2054
01:16:07,477 --> 01:16:10,037
I want to move forward in time again.

2055
01:16:11,115 --> 01:16:13,049
往前移两个礼拜

2056
01:16:11,114 --> 01:16:13,048
Oh, say, two weeks.

2057
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:17,549
你…

2058

你可以睁开眼睛，到处走走

2060
01:16:17,654 --> 01:16:21,021
If you would like to open your eyes or move around, you may.

2061
01:16:21,592 --> 01:16:24,356
你想不想         我知道可以

2062
01:16:22,092 --> 01:16:24,424
- Would you like to? - I know that.

01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:37,533

01:16:47,484 --> 01:16:51,682
He just... sometimes wants to talk things over...

2077
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:56,488
找人谈谈心事

2078
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:56,554
with someone every now and then.

2079
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:58,488
告诉我他做什么

2080
01:16:56,626 --> 01:16:58,560
Tell me about Pete now.

2081
01:16:58,596 --> 01:17:01,997
他是个击昏者         击昏者？

2082
01:16:58,628 --> 01:17:02,064
- He's a knocker. - A "knocker"?

2083
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,194
就是负责把牛击昏

2084
01:17:02,132 --> 01:17:05,260
A knocker is the guy that knocks the cow inside of the head...

2085
01:17:05,303 --> 01:17:08,500
让它乖乖的任人宰割

2086
01:17:05,335 --> 01:17:08,566
<i>so it won't struggle while they slit its throat.</i>

2087
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:13,109
我知道，很野蛮，对不对

2088
01:17:08,638 --> 01:17:12,130
I know. It's barbaric, isn't it?

2089
01:17:13,478 --> 01:17:15,412
他还住在同一个地方

2090
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:15,439
Does he still live in the same town?

2091
01:17:16,013 --> 01:17:20,916
他住在镇外，有间小房子 整理得不错

2092
01:17:15,512 --> 01:17:18,447
Oh, just outside of town.

2093
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:21,006
He's got a little place, but he's fixed it up nice.

2094
01:17:21,018 --> 01:17:26,149
有树、有几亩地…

2095
01:17:21,084 --> 01:17:25,885
It's got some... trees and a couple of acres...

2096
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,395
还有一条河

2097
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:32,461
and a river.

2098
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:40,228
没有那条河，就很像K派斯

2099
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,294
It reminds me of K-PAX, except for the river.

2100
01:17:44,642 --> 01:17:48,442
告诉我，他有没有娶他女朋友

2101
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:48,506
Tell me, did he ever marry that pregnant girl?

2102
01:17:50,782 --> 01:17:52,716
哇，你记性真好

2103
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,748
Wow, what a memory.

2104
01:17:52,817 --> 01:17:54,910
他们结婚了，都生了一个小孩

2105
01:17:52,816 --> 01:17:57,378
Yeah, they got married, but she's no longer pregnant. Why, that was six years ago.

2106
01:17:55,019 --> 01:17:57,283
那是六年前的事

2107
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:00,754
我忘了她叫什么名字

2108
01:17:58,454 --> 01:18:00,820
I've forgotten her name.

2109
01:18:00,858 --> 01:18:02,758
莎…

2110
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,824
S...

2111
01:18:05,763 --> 01:18:07,230
我没跟你说过她的名字

2112
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:07,295
I didn't tell you her name.

2113
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:09,324
你可以告诉我吗？

2114
01:18:07,363 --> 01:18:09,331
Can you tell me now?

2115
01:18:25,783 --> 01:18:27,910
莎拉

2116
01:18:25,782 --> 01:18:27,977
Sara.

2117
01:18:35,693 --> 01:18:38,594
他们生了个男孩还是女孩

2118
01:18:35,692 --> 01:18:38,627
<i>Did they have a son or a daughter?</i>

2119
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:45,535
丽贝卡

2120
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,534
Rebecca.

2121
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:53,309
丽贝卡

2122
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:53,341
Rebecca.

2123
01:18:58,683 --> 01:19:01,516
下个礼拜是她生日

2124
01:18:58,681 --> 01:19:01,548
It's her birthday next week.

2125
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:25,542
查克，怎么回事 豪伊想杀恩尼

2126
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:25,574
<i>- Chak, what's happened? - Howie tried to kill Ernie.</i>

2127
01:19:25,643 --> 01:19:28,134
什么？         他没事

2128
01:19:25,642 --> 01:19:27,803
- What? - He's fine.

2129
01:19:29,981 --> 01:19:31,005
恩尼

2130
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:33,814
- Ernie? - I feel wonderful, Dr. Powell.

2131
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,113
鲍威尔医生，我觉得很好

2132
01:19:34,218 --> 01:19:35,981
真的很好 发生什么事？

2133
01:19:33,883 --> 01:19:35,976
- For heaven's sake. What happened? - Absolutely wonderful.

2134
01:19:37,188 --> 01:19:41,648
我的好朋友豪伊，差点勒死我

2135
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:41,719
My good friend Howie, he just about strangled me to death.

2136
01:19:41,759 --> 01:19:43,192
什么？

2137
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:44,760
- What? - [Laughing]

2138
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:46,694
那个混蛋，算他狠

2139
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:46,761
Son of a bitch, I love him.

2140
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:48,761
恩尼，我不明白

2141
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:48,797
Ernie, I don't understand.

2142
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,592
可惜你们没看到，我在睡觉

2143
01:19:48,865 --> 01:19:51,265
<i>[Ernie] You should've seen it.</i>

2144
01:19:52,703 --> 01:19:54,967
像平常那样，绑住手脚睡

2145
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:55,031
I was asleep. You know, the way I like... my hands tied and everything.

2146
01:19:55,072 --> 01:19:57,836
他用手帕之类的，绕住我脖子

2147
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:57,902
He wrapped something around my neck... a handkerchief or something...

2148
01:19:57,942 --> 01:20:00,240
用力勒

2149
01:19:57,974 --> 01:20:00,272
and then tightened it.

2150
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:02,369
我根本没办法反抗

2151
01:20:00,343 --> 01:20:02,402
There wasn't a damn thing I could do about it.

2152
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,971
我一窒息…

2153
01:20:02,478 --> 01:20:05,038
Well, when I stopped breathing,

2154
01:20:05,082 --> 01:20:06,982
他立刻送我上来

2155
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:07,048
he lifted me onto the gurney, rushed me up here,

2156
01:20:07,084 --> 01:20:09,848
他们马上就把我救醒了

2157
01:20:07,116 --> 01:20:09,914
and they brought me back as quick as they could.

2158
01:20:09,954 --> 01:20:12,388
我醒过来的时候

2159
01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:12,420
And when I woke up,

2160
01:20:14,725 --> 01:20:16,920
你知道我想通了什么吗

2161
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:16,988
you know what I realized, Dr. Powell?

2162
01:20:19,497 --> 01:20:21,988
死亡

2163
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:22,026
Dying.

2164
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:25,830
死亡不是我能控制的

2165
01:20:22,098 --> 01:20:25,363
Dying's something you have no control over.

2166
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:29,771
何必一天到晚自己吓自己

2167
01:20:26,469 --> 01:20:29,836
Why waste your life being afraid of it?

2168
01:20:30,574 --> 01:20:33,304
我现在敢趴着睡

2169
01:20:29,906 --> 01:20:32,704
I'll sleep on my stomach from now on.

2170
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:37,370
有刺的鱼我也敢吃 多大粒的药我都敢吞

2171
01:20:32,775 --> 01:20:34,709
I'll eat fish with bones in it.

2172
01:20:34,777 --> 01:20:37,439
I'll swallow the biggest pill you can find. Bring it on.

2173
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:40,808
我觉得很好

2174
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:40,846
[Chuckles] I feel good.

2175
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:42,851
<i>[Chuckling]</i>

2176
01:20:45,122 --> 01:20:47,647
太好了，恩尼

2177
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:47,720
That's terrific, Ernie.

2178
01:20:49,894 --> 01:20:52,886
明天治疗时间见

2179
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,827
- See you at our session tomorrow? - Yes.

2180
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:57,634
我是不是治好他了？

2181
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:57,689
I cured him, didn't I?

2182
01:21:00,371 --> 01:21:04,671
波特说再完成一项任务 我也就好了

2183
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:03,702
Prot says one more task and I'll be cured too.

2184
01:21:04,775 --> 01:21:08,211
然后就拜拜

2185
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:08,301
And then it's... bon voyage.

2186
01:21:28,965 --> 01:21:30,899
[Dings]

2187
01:22:11,774 --> 01:22:13,708
[Sighs]

2188
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:22,045
告诉我你叫什么名字吧

2189
01:22:19,849 --> 01:22:22,113
Tell me your name, damn it.

2190
01:22:41,806 --> 01:22:44,104
我会给你一个特定的日期

2191
01:22:41,871 --> 01:22:44,169
I'm gonna give you a specific date,

2192
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:47,700
我要你说出那天 你在哪儿，在做什么

2193
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,732
and I want you to remember where you were and what you were doing on that day.

2194
01:22:47,812 --> 01:22:48,801
明白吗？

2195
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:49,835
Do you understand?

2196
01:22:49,747 --> 01:22:52,011
明白，亲爱的医生

2197
01:22:49,912 --> 01:22:52,073
Perfectly well, my dear sir.

2198
01:22:52,116 --> 01:22:57,247
日期是1996年7月27日

2199
01:22:52,148 --> 01:22:57,279
<i>The date is July 27, 1996.</i>

2200
01:22:59,056 --> 01:23:00,216
我在K派斯

2201
01:22:58,354 --> 01:23:00,288
I'm on K-PAX.

2202
01:23:02,259 --> 01:23:04,523
你确定？         我确定

2203
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:04,586
<i>- Are you sure? - Quite sure, governor.</i>

2204
01:23:04,628 --> 01:23:06,653
我在收割克平做粮食

2205
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,685
<i>I'm harvesting croppins for a meal.</i>

2206
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:10,393
克平是一种真菌 就像你们的松露

2207
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:10,459
<i>Croppins are a fungi, like, uh, your truffles.</i>

2208
01:23:10,501 --> 01:23:12,765
好吃的松露，你喜欢吗…

2209
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:12,831
Big truffles. Delicious. Do you like tru...

2210
01:23:17,508 --> 01:23:19,408
等一下

2211
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:19,474
Wait a minute.

2212
01:23:21,412 --> 01:23:23,642
又来了 怎么了？是皮特

2213
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:23,674
- There it is. - What? Is it Pete?

2214
01:23:23,747 --> 01:23:26,181
是

2215
01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:25,680
Yes.

2216
01:23:26,283 --> 01:23:29,650
我感觉到出事了，他需要我

2217
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:29,717
I sense something is wrong. He needs me.

2218
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:37,356
我现在到了地球，跟他在一起

2219
01:23:33,089 --> 01:23:35,387
I'm now on Earth.

2220
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:37,392
I'm with him.

2221
01:23:37,995 --> 01:23:40,429
你在哪儿？在做什么

2222
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:40,452
And where are you? What are you doing?

2223
01:23:41,765 --> 01:23:44,199
在河边

2224
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:44,231
By a river...

2225
01:23:44,301 --> 01:23:47,862
就在他家后面

2226
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:47,895
in the back of his house.

2227
01:23:47,972 --> 01:23:49,872
很黑

2228
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,904
It's dark.

2229
01:23:51,509 --> 01:23:53,636
他在脱衣服

2230
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:53,668
He's taking off his clothes.

2231
01:23:54,145 --> 01:23:55,635
他为什么要脱衣服

2232
01:23:53,743 --> 01:23:55,677
Why is he doing that?

2233
01:23:55,746 --> 01:23:58,214

<i>Robert Porter. Ah, here it is.</i>

我记得这件案子

01:30:20,396 --> 01:30:22,330
Yeah, I do remember this case.

2411
01:30:22,065 --> 01:30:24,966
当年曾经轰动一时

2412

<i>It was about the biggest thing ever happened around these parts.</i>

沉默寡言

2414
01:30:26,569 --> 01:30:29,766
He was a quiet type.

2415
01:30:29,806 --> 01:30:33,298
我印象中，他是个聪明的家伙

2416
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:33,399
As I recall, he was a real smart fella. Kind of brainy.

2417
01:30:33,944 --> 01:30:36,037
而且力气非常大

2418
01:30:33,475 --> 01:30:36,103
Strong as a horse, though, and worked as a knocker.

2419

住在镇外廿英里的地方 夫妻两生了一个女儿

2420
01:30:36,178 --> 01:30:40,114
Lived about 20 miles outside of town with his-his wife and child.

His wife's name was Sarah.

2424
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:48,621
没错

2425
01:30:46,255 --> 01:30:48,655
That's right.

2426
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:50,989
一件悲剧

2427
01:30:48,724 --> 01:30:51,022
Damn shame what happened.

2428
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:56,164
想不想去看看？         好

2429

Yeah.

Well, it's been empty.

2433
01:31:25,696 --> 01:31:30,292
事发之后就没人来过

2434
01:31:25,728 --> 01:31:27,889
Yeah, nobody comes around here much anymore...

2435
01:31:27,963 --> 01:31:30,329
since all that happened.

2436

也没有亲属继承

Ain't no livin' next of kin to give the place to anyway.

2438
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:48,015
城里派了警探

2439
01:31:45,648 --> 01:31:48,082
I had detectives come down from Albuquerque...

2440
01:31:48,952 --> 01:31:50,783
把案发的经过拼凑出来

2441

01:32:10,472 --> 01:32:12,406
Started out as a robbery.

他老婆跟女儿在后面

2453

From what we can gather from forensics and all,

2460

那家伙逼她们母女进屋

2461

this Walker, he, uh... he forced the two women into the house.

一把就扭断了他的脖子

They found the clothes there.

2481

他大概是从那里跳进去

01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,810
That's probably where he jumped in.

2483

Scotch okay, or would you prefer something more fruity?

威士忌就可以

2539
01:39:35,717 --> 01:39:38,117
I will try the scotch.

我应该会

2559
01:40:38,313 --> 01:40:41,180
I may just do that, Prot.

2560
01:40:43,086 --> 01:40:45,748
你知道我这一趟有什么感触

2561
01:40:43,084 --> 01:40:45,814
You know what I've learned about your planet?

2562
01:40:45,855 --> 01:40:49,222
地球的生物多到 能住满五十个星球

2563
01:40:45,887 --> 01:40:49,323
There's enough life on Earth to fill 50 planets...

2564
01:40:49,325 --> 01:40:52,385
植物、动物、人 细菌、病毒…

2565
01:40:49,391 --> 01:40:52,451
plants, animals, people, fungi, viruses...

2566
01:40:52,495 --> 01:40:55,225
你推我挤的，设法生存

2567
01:40:52,527 --> 01:40:55,291
all jostling to find their place,

2568
01:40:55,331 --> 01:40:58,198
撞来撞去，互相依赖

2569
01:40:55,363 --> 01:40:58,298
bouncing off each other, feeding off each other,

2570
01:41:00,236 --> 01:41:01,225

2571
01:41:00,035 --> 01:41:01,297

2572
01:41:03,072 --> 01:41:07,008
在K派斯没有这种关系？

2573
01:41:03,138 --> 01:41:07,097
You don't have that kind of connection on K-PAX?

2574
01:41:08,011 --> 01:41:09,706
无欲无求

2575
01:41:07,676 --> 01:41:09,769
Nobody wants, nobody needs.

2576
01:41:09,812 --> 01:41:12,144
就算我离开K派斯 也不会有人怀念我

2577
01:41:09,844 --> 01:41:12,210
On K-PAX, when I'm gone, nobody misses me.

2578
01:41:12,248 --> 01:41:14,944
因为没有理由

2579
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,510
There would be no reason to.

2580
01:41:15,051 --> 01:41:17,679
可是我觉得离开这里

2581
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:17,779
And yet I sense that when I leave here,

2582
01:41:21,257 --> 01:41:22,724
我会被人怀念

2583
01:41:20,855 --> 01:41:22,789
I will be missed.

2584
01:41:25,328 --> 01:41:26,260
对

2585
01:41:25,227 --> 01:41:26,319
Yes.

2586
01:41:28,031 --> 01:41:30,056
奇怪的感觉

2587
01:41:28,096 --> 01:41:30,121
Strange feeling.

2588
01:41:30,166 --> 01:41:32,634
你不一定要走

2589
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:32,723
You don't have to leave, Prot.

2590
01:41:33,403 --> 01:41:36,702
留下来，我会想办法帮你

2591
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:36,737
I'm sure there must be some way that I can help you...

2592
01:41:36,806 --> 01:41:40,867
变成我们的一份子

2593
01:41:36,805 --> 01:41:40,901
to stay as one of us.

2594

我得把报告写完，可是…

2599
01:42:04,099 --> 01:42:06,533
And I have to finish my report, but...

2600
01:42:09,138 --> 01:42:12,733
铅笔好像被我弄丢了

2601
01:42:09,137 --> 01:42:12,106
I seem to have misplaced my pencil.

2602
01:42:25,655 --> 01:42:27,122
用我的

2603
01:42:25,253 --> 01:42:27,187
Take mine.

2604
01:42:35,298 --> 01:42:38,426
更方便的书写工具

2605
01:42:35,297 --> 01:42:38,460
A much more efficient writing tool.

2606
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,798
再会了，我的朋友

2607
01:42:43,938 --> 01:42:45,872
Adios, my friend.

2608
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:50,135
Prot?

2609
01:42:51,514 --> 01:42:53,948
我给你看一样东西

2610
01:42:51,546 --> 01:42:53,980
I wanna show you something.

2611
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:05,584
那是罗伯波特

2612
01:43:03,892 --> 01:43:05,553
That is Robert Porter.

01:43:05,593 --> 01:43:08,289
Prot, that's you.

2615
01:43:08,598 --> 01:43:11,192
你就是罗伯波特

2616
01:43:08,697 --> 01:43:11,097
You and Robert Porter are the same person.

2617
01:43:12,135 --> 01:43:15,195
太可笑了，我根本不是人类

2618
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,235
That's patently absurd. I'm not even human.

2619
01:43:15,305 --> 01:43:18,763
你就不能承认有那个可能

2620
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:18,171
Can't you at least admit the possibility?

2621
01:43:19,309 --> 01:43:22,745
要我承认我有可能是罗伯波特

2622
01:43:18,907 --> 01:43:22,240
I will admit the possibility that I am Robert Porter...

2623
01:43:23,246 --> 01:43:26,215
除非你承认

2624
01:43:23,311 --> 01:43:25,745
if you will admit the possibility...

2625
01:43:26,316 --> 01:43:28,648
我有可能是K派斯人

2626
01:43:26,314 --> 01:43:28,714

2634
01:43:43,832 --> 01:43:46,824

2635

Well, I can tell you this.

01:49:40,321 --> 01:49:42,152
Son of a bitch.

2723
01:49:51,033 --> 01:49:52,967
天哪

2724
01:49:50,998 --> 01:49:52,090
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2725
01:49:56,405 --> 01:49:58,999
天啊         天哪

2726
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:59,032
<i>- Oh, man. - Oh, God.</i>

2727
01:49:59,108 --> 01:50:03,010
准备急救         帮我拉他出来

2728
01:49:59,107 --> 01:50:03,009
<i>- Call a code blue. - Help me. Let's get him.</i>

2729
01:50:13,788 --> 01:50:16,814
[Monitor Beeping]

2730
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:21,286
那是谁？ 谁知道，他是怎么进来的

2731
01:50:18,259 --> 01:50:21,319
- Who's that? - Beats me. How'd he get in here?

2732
01:50:21,397 --> 01:50:25,299
那不是波特 不可能是波特

2733
01:50:21,395 --> 01:50:25,297
- That's not Prot. - He's definitely not Prot.

2734
01:50:25,401 --> 01:50:28,461
绝对不是，波特已经走了

2735
01:50:25,366 --> 01:50:28,529
Certainly not. Prot's gone.

2736
01:50:31,907 --> 01:50:33,807
贝丝呢？

2737
01:50:31,906 --> 01:50:33,840
Where's Bess?

2738
01:50:33,909 --> 01:50:37,106
贝丝人呢？贝丝

2739
01:50:33,908 --> 01:50:37,173
<i>[Man] Where's Bess? Bess?</i>

2740
01:50:49,925 --> 01:50:52,519
他选了贝丝

2741
01:50:49,557 --> 01:50:52,025
He chose Bess.

2742
01:50:52,628 --> 01:50:53,993
贱人

2743
01:50:52,093 --> 01:50:54,027
Bitch!

2744
01:50:54,897 --> 01:50:56,694
再见，贝丝

2745
01:50:54,095 --> 01:50:56,586
<i>[Man] Good-bye, Bess.</i>

2746
01:50:58,267 --> 01:51:00,064
祝你好运，小妹妹

2747
01:50:58,266 --> 01:50:59,961
Good for you, homegirl.

2748
01:51:20,156 --> 01:51:22,522
贝丝去K派斯了

2749
01:51:19,887 --> 01:51:22,549
Bess went to K-PAX.

2750
01:51:28,664 --> 01:51:33,124
“我无家可归，贝丝”

2751
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:49,613
287号病人，罗伯波特

2752
01:51:44,912 --> 01:51:48,348
[Mark's Voice] Patient 287, Robert Porter.

2753
01:51:50,119 --> 01:51:53,111
希望他有一天会坐起来说

2754
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:53,151
<i>How I wish I could say that Robert sat up one fine day...</i>

2755
01:51:53,222 --> 01:51:55,986
我肚子饿，有没有水果吃

2756
01:51:53,221 --> 01:51:56,019
<i>and said, "I'm hungry. Got any fruit? '"</i>

2757
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:02,192
像大部分紧张性精神病患一样 他能听到我们说的每一句话

2758
01:51:57,925 --> 01:52:00,416
<i>Like most catatonics,</i>

2759
01:52:00,494 --> 01:52:02,428
<i>he probably hears every word we say...</i>

2760
01:52:02,298 --> 01:52:05,756
可是他拒绝或者他不能回答

2761
01:52:02,496 --> 01:52:05,761
<i>but refuses or is unable to respond.</i>

2762
01:52:07,169 --> 01:52:11,299
不过，我还是向他报告近况

2763
01:52:07,201 --> 01:52:11,331
<i>Nevertheless, I keep him up to date.</i>

2764
01:52:14,910 --> 01:52:19,370
豪伊，他去了图书馆做事

2765
01:52:14,108 --> 01:52:16,269
Let's see. I told you about Howie.

2766
01:52:16,344 --> 01:52:18,778
He got that job at the public library.

2767
01:52:19,915 --> 01:52:24,011
恩尼决定要当危机咨询员

2768
01:52:20,081 --> 01:52:24,074
And Ernie, he's determined to be a crisis counselor.

2769
01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:28,317
我们唯一担心的是贝丝

2770
01:52:24,151 --> 01:52:28,315
The only one we're, uh, really concerned about is Bess.

2771
01:52:28,757 --> 01:52:30,918
我们找遍了过渡疗养院、收容所

2772
01:52:28,389 --> 01:52:30,949
You know, we've checked halfway houses, shelters,

2773
01:52:31,026 --> 01:52:33,688
教堂、公车站

2774
01:52:31,025 --> 01:52:33,721
churches, bus stops.

2775
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:37,421
都一无所获

2776
01:52:34,896 --> 01:52:36,295
Nothing.

2777
01:52:37,533 --> 01:52:40,093
我不明白，不可能…

2778
01:52:37,531 --> 01:52:40,125
Uh, we don't understand. It's like...

2779
01:52:40,669 --> 01:52:43,137
人不可能突然就消失

2780
01:52:40,201 --> 01:52:43,170
people don't just disappear.

2781
01:52:46,876 --> 01:52:49,208
7月27日？

2782
01:52:46,874 --> 01:52:49,274
July 27.

2783
01:52:49,678 --> 01:52:52,545
你不会知道她的下落吧？

2784
01:52:49,343 --> 01:52:52,574
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?

2785
01:52:54,884 --> 01:52:56,784
罗伯？

2786
01:52:54,882 --> 01:52:56,816
Robert?

2787
01:53:01,589 --> 01:53:02,851
No.

2788
01:53:04,093 --> 01:53:06,459
也许你会想起来

2789
01:53:04,091 --> 01:53:06,491
Well, maybe it'll come to you.

2790
01:53:08,931 --> 01:53:11,331
准备好的时候告诉我

2791
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:11,364
Whenever you're ready, I'll be waiting.

2792
01:53:38,494 --> 01:53:41,258
“去去就回，勿碰” 马克，我要告诉你一件

2793
01:53:38,459 --> 01:53:41,257
<i>[Prot's Voice] I want to tell you something, Mark,</i>

2794
01:53:41,363 --> 01:53:43,388
你还不知道…

2795
01:53:41,329 --> 01:53:43,388
<i>something you do not yet know,</i>

2796
01:53:43,499 --> 01:53:46,832
可是我们K派斯人 好久以前就发现的事

2797
01:53:43,464 --> 01:53:46,865
<i>but we K-PAXians have been around long enough to have discovered.</i>

2798
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:50,531
宇宙会膨胀

2799
01:53:48,336 --> 01:53:50,566
<i>The universe will expand,</i>

2800
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:52,698
然后缩回原形

2801
01:53:50,638 --> 01:53:52,731
<i>then it will collapse back on itself,</i>

2802
01:53:53,242 --> 01:53:55,233
然后再膨胀

2803
01:53:52,807 --> 01:53:55,275
<i>and then it will expand again.</i>

2804
01:53:55,344 --> 01:53:58,541
如此周而复始

2805
01:53:55,343 --> 01:53:58,574
<i>It will repeat this process forever.</i>

2806
01:53:58,647 --> 01:54:01,673
你不知道的是 当宇宙再度膨胀

2807
01:53:58,646 --> 01:54:01,706
<i>What you don't know is that when the universe expands again,</i>

2808
01:54:02,184 --> 01:54:04,948
现在的情况又会重演

2809
01:54:01,782 --> 01:54:05,013
<i>everything will be as it is now.</i>

2810
01:54:05,054 --> 01:54:07,045
你这次犯的错

2811
01:54:05,086 --> 01:54:09,352
<i>Whatever mistakes you make this time around, you will live through on your next pass.</i>

2812
01:54:07,156 --> 01:54:09,317
下次会再出现

2813
01:54:09,692 --> 01:54:11,853
你犯的每一个错

2814
01:54:09,423 --> 01:54:11,891
<i>Every mistake you make...</i>

2815
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:16,022
将会一次又一次的出现

2816
01:54:11,959 --> 01:54:13,893
<i>you will live through...</i>

2817
01:54:13,961 --> 01:54:17,988
<i>again and again, forever.</i>

2818
01:54:16,131 --> 01:54:17,928
永无止境

2819
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,867
所以我劝你，有错要马上改

2820
01:54:18,065 --> 01:54:21,865
<i>So my advice to you is to get it right this time around,</i>

2821
01:54:21,971 --> 01:54:27,102
因为这次是你唯一的机会

2822
01:54:21,936 --> 01:54:24,496
<i>because this time...</i>

2823
01:54:24,572 --> 01:54:26,972
<i>is all you have.</i>

2824
01:54:37,853 --> 01:54:41,220
你看起来不错         真的？

2825
01:54:37,485 --> 01:54:41,251
- You're lookin' great, Michael. - Think so?

2826
01:54:42,558 --> 01:54:44,549
谢谢，你好吗         很好

2827
01:54:41,989 --> 01:54:43,616
Thanks. How you doin'?

2828
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:48,653
旅途还愉快吧？      还好

2829
01:54:43,691 --> 01:54:46,023
Good. How was your... How was your trip?

2830
01:54:46,093 --> 01:54:48,357
Was it... Was it good?

2831
01:55:16,025 --> 01:55:18,050
剧终

2832

<i>? Maybe this is forever?</i>

2833
01:55:37,511 --> 01:55:39,775
<i>? Forever fades away?</i>

2834
01:55:41,215 --> 01:55:43,479
<i>? Like a rocket ascending?</i>

2835

<i>? Into space?</i>
