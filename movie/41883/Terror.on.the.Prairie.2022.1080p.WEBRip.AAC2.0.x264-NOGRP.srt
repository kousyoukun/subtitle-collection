5
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,962
主后悔造人在世间
And it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth

6
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,072
心感悲痛
and it grieved his heart.

7
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,968
主说: "吾要灭绝"
And the lord said, "I will destroy a man"

8
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,132
"吾在世间所造之人"

I said, that's enough.

13

我道歉 吉迪恩
I apologize, Gideon.

14

若礼貌能造就人 那我周围就都是弱鸡

那你就知道我为什么在这儿
Then you know why I'm here.

20
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:54,390
你的眼泪令人赞赏
Your tears, they do you credit.

21

我毫不怀疑上帝会原谅你
And I have no doubt that god will forgive you

23
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,986
通过其子(耶稣)之血

24
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,599
但我不是上帝
But I ain't god.

25
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,933
去死吧 你这个狗娘养的

Give me that.

43
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:07,746
引导我们不受诱惑 拯救我们脱离邪恶
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

44
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:09,276
阿门 阿门
Amen. Amen.

45
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,136
你去打那只该死的土狼
You go hunt down that damn coyote,

46
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,137
否则我们会失去更多的鸡
before we lose any more of our chickens.

47
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,324
爸
Uh, pa?

48
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:25,436
我可以和你一起打猎吗
Can I come hunt with you?

49
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:28,955
问你妈
Ask your ma.

50
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,669
我能吗
Well, can I?

51
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,796
我能吗
Can I?

52
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:41,906
只要你完成你的家务
If you finish your chores.

53
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:51,649
打扫我的床 喂贝丝
Gotta clean my bed, feed Bess.

54
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,347
这是什么
What's this?

55
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,998
妈妈给我的
Ma gave it to me.

56
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:08,857
她说你在700码外射杀一名骑马的红色少校
She said you shot a red major clean off his horse at 700 yards.

57
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,017
我想她说的是
I think she said

58
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,337
我应该能在700码外射杀一名骑马的红色少校
I could shoot a red major off his horse 700 yards.

59
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:17,324
我做不到
I can't.

60
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,064
没人能
Nobody can.

61
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,953
你确实杀了很多南方士兵
(指: 美国内战1861–65时的南方联盟军士兵)
But you did kill rebs.

62
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:24,987
这样说不好 儿子
It ain't polite conversation, son.

63
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:29,641
你曾是个神枪手吗
You were a sharp shooter?

64
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,352
我现在还是 小子
I'm still a sharp shooter, boy.

65
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,846
你永远不要忘记这一点 晚安

海蒂·麦卡利斯特 谁会想到呢
Hattie McAllister, who would've thought?

67
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:01,951
扎着双马尾辫 我们过去常常
Grilling pigtails, we used to eat candy

68
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,352
在你爸爸的商店后面吃糖果和看书
and read books in the back of your daddy's store

69
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:09,631
总有一天我们会和最好的他们一起
that someday we'd be homesteading this wild country

70
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:10,732
在这个狂野的国家安家
with the best of them.

71
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:16,432
我们能在这里成功吗
Are we gonna make it out here?

72
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,994
只是要有一点勇气
Just gotta have a little grit.

73
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:21,244
我不知道在哪里可以找到它了
I don't know where to find that anymore.

74
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,450
相信你能
Sure you do.

75
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,451
我知道
I know.

76
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:29,548
在内心深处 你是这片领土上最坚强的女人
Deep down, you're the toughest woman in this territory.

77
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:06,322
爸爸在半英里外射杀了土狼
Pa shot that coyote from half mile away.

78
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:10,878
哦 距离大概是100码
Oh, it was more like 100 yards.

79
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:19,458
天哪 发生什么事了
Good lord, hat. What the hell happened?

80
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:22,434
妈妈
Ma?

81
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:44,180
男孩睡下了 晚饭也收拾完了
Boy's down. Supper's put away.

82
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,646
对不起
I'm sorry.

83
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,480
他们离开保留地
They must have wandered

84
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,615
一定是为了寻找什么东西
off the reservation looking for something.

85
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,616
结果一无所获
Got no scrap.

86
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:04,978
我想回家
I want to go home.

87
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,159
好吧 如果你想见你的家人
All right, if you wanna see your folks,

88
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:10,695
我想我可以在铁路公司找份工作
reckon I can get a work with the railroad.

89
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:11,696
可以给你买张车票
Buy you a ticket.

90
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,697
我不要票
I don't want a ticket.

91
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:16,684
我想收拾好马车 带我们的孩子
I want to pack the wagon and take our children out

92
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,798
离开这个被上帝遗弃的地方
of this god forsaken place.

93
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,914
我知道这里很是艰苦 但这是一块好土地
I know it's been hard, but this here's good land.

94
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,358
我们住在棚屋里 杰比
We live in a shack, Jeb.

95
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,704
破旧的工具 疲惫的牲畜
We've got old tools, worn out live stock,

96
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:31,754
养活我们的孩子
and can only feed our children

97
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,555
还要靠从商店借来的食物
with food borrowed off store credit.

98
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,027
我明白这很艰难
I understand it's been tough.

99
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,883
但这是我们的梦想 海蒂
But this is our dream, Hattie.

100
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,953
这就是我们打算做的
This is what we set out to do,

101
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,004
在可以称之为自己的土地上 建造一个家
build a home on land we can call our own.

102
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,624
我想让你向我爸爸找一份工作
I want you to ask my daddy for a job.

103
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,483
你想让我们爬回他身边?
You want us to crawl back to him?

104
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:57,163
我们自己做不到
We can't make it on our own.

105
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:59,613
见鬼 是的 我们能行 我们只需不断前行
Hell, yes, we can. We just gotta keep on going.

106
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,043
我不行
Well, I can't.

107
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,102
很好
That's good.

108
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:26,651
我要进城去 拿些补给品
I'm gonna ahead into town, grab supplies.

109
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,485
做一个坚强的男孩
Be a strong boy.

110
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,609
我在城里的时候照顾你妈妈 好吗
Look after your mom while I'm in town, won't ya?

111
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,096

112
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:11,099
- 杰比   - 嘿驾 出发
Jeb. Hiyah, go!

113
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:47,948
我想这是我们应得的
I think we've earned it.

114
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,632
爸爸说糖果是一种真正的款待
Pa says candy's a real treat,

115
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,751
只用于圣诞节和葬礼
just for Christmas and funerals.

116
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:56,497
我小时候在圣路易斯的时候
When I was a girl in St. Louis,

117
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:57,911
我们每周都吃糖果
we'd have candy every week.

118
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:00,127
真的
Really?

119
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,987
我们夏天吃冰淇淋
We'd have ice cream in the summer,

120
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:06,247
秋天吃太妃糖 圣诞节吃薄荷棒
toffee in the fall and peppermint sticks at Christmas.

121
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:07,848
你会喜欢住在那里的
You would've loved living there.

122
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:12,547
奶奶和爷爷真的不想让你...
Is it true that granny and gramps didn't want you

123
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:13,547
嫁给爸爸吗?
to marry pa?

124
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,146
他们只是对我想要什么
They just had their own ideas

125
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,216
有自己的想法
about what they wanted for me.

126
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:22,416
但你爸爸是个英雄 他保护密苏里州免受南方士兵的攻击
But pa's a hero. He defended Missouri from the rebs.

127
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,744
你爸爸曾经也是个南方士兵
Your pa was a reb.

128
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,087
他用它联合了大家 拯救了(北方)联邦军
He used it to be join up to save the Union.

129
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,217
当时的事情并不简单
Things weren't simple back then.

130
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:35,327
威尔
Will.

131
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,854
早上好 夫人
I might fine morning to you, ma'am.

132
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,504
你好
And to you.

133
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:17,588
我想知道我们是否可以麻烦你给我们一些水
I wonder if we might trouble you for some of your water.

134
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:22,203
我们的坐骑快要渴死了 我们也差不多
Our mounts are about dried out and we're not much better.

135
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:23,554
想喝多少都可以

00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,174
威尔
Will.

138
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,992
你怎么了 儿子
What's the matter with you, son.

139
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,843
你妈没教过你礼仪吗
Didn't your ma teach you any manners?

140
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,322
我听说你没有妈妈 从妓女那里辍学
You didn't have no ma, dropped out of a whore

141
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:00,854
由那些皮货商抚养长大
and raised by those fur traders, is what I heard.

142
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,656
真抱歉 夫人
I do apologize, ma'am.

143
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:07,981
我们已经在马鞍上坐了大约三个月了
We have been in the saddle for about three months now

144
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,741
我担心后果已经开始显现
and I'm afraid it is beginning to show.

145
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,341
嗯 我不小心注意到你在那边的鸡舍
Um, I couldn't help, but notice your Coop over yonder,

146
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:17,431
我...我想知道我是否可以买一些咸肉
I, I wonder if I might offer to buy some salt pork

147
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,591
也许还有一打鸡蛋
and maybe a dozen eggs.

148
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:20,992
需要什么就拿什么
Fetch as many as you need.

149
00:25:24,134 --> 00:25:25,134
那好
Well.

150
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,011
我必须承认
I must confess,

151
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,204
我确实觉得和一位女士谈生意有点超前
I, I do feel a bit forward talking business with a lady.

152
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,934
嗯 你丈夫在家吗
Uh, is your husband at home?

153
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:38,164
他不在 去城里了
He ain't here. He gone to town.

154
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:45,090
哦 那么我想肯定是
Oh, well then I guess that makes you the man

155
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,241
你当家了
of the house, I reckon.

156
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,683
哦 还有一件事
Oh, uh, one more thing.

157
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,609
我猜你是密苏里口音吧
Is that a Missouri accent that I detect.

158
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,869
圣路易斯
St. Louis.

159
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,319
就知道吗 真是巧了
I knew it. What a happy coincidence.

160
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,949
我自己是一个卡梅伦人 那边那个大个子
I am a Cameron man, myself, that big fella over there,

161
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,596
他来自阿肯色州 但我们尽量不反对它
he's from Arkansas, but we try not to hold that against it.

162
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,318
我们不会让很多密苏里人这样出去
We don't get many Missourians out this way.

163
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,972
不 夫人 我希望你不会
No, ma'am, I expect you don't.

164
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:35,262
我很乐意在你们走之前给你们做些早餐
I'd be happy to cook you men some breakfast before you go.

165
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:39,661
那好 我们不胜感激
Well, we would be much obliged.

166
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:51,758
你真是太好了 夫人
This is very kind of you, ma'am.

167
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:07,166
那些是你的家人了 夫人 如何称呼
Those your folks over there, Mrs. Uh?

168
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,696
- 麦卡利斯特   - 麦卡利斯特

169
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:11,670
海蒂 小的叫贝丝 大的叫威尔

去收拾桌子
Set the table.

171
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:18,926
你多大了?
How old are you?

172
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:21,025
9岁多
Nine and three quarters.

173
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:24,629
我觉得够大了 可以带上这个了
Why then, I reckon that's big enough to wear one of these.

174
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:34,315
您的家真可爱 麦卡利斯特夫人
This is a lovely home you have here, Mrs. McAllister.

175
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:35,819
你丈夫是个幸运的人
Your husband is a lucky man.

176
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:48,774
她想说话
She wants to talk.

177
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:50,638
哦 我能抱抱吗
Oh, now here, allow me.

178
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,005
我一生中抱过一个两岁的孩子
I've held a baby at two in my life.

179
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,744

那是南方士兵的歌吗
Is that a reb song?

200
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:12,050
需要教她这首歌

You ain' got a problem with rebs, now do you, boy.

206
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:27,617
我们年轻的主人是在敌对结束后出生的
Our young host was born after hostilities ended.

207
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,411
我相信他是一个自豪的美国人 不是吗 小伙
I'm sure he's a proud American, aren't you, boy.

208
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:32,957
没什么不对的
Nothing wrong with that,

209
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,867
人应该忠于自己的国家
man should be loyal to his own country.

210
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:36,868
不是每个人都这样
Not everybody is.

211
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,027
我爸爸是一个神枪手
My daddy was a sharp shooter.

212
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:42,027
他现在是吗
Was he now?

213
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:45,916
威尔自己的射击也不错
Will's not a bad shot himself.

214
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:47,296
你为什么不去让这些先生们看看...
Why don't you go show these gentlemen

215
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,247
你爸爸给你的猎枪
that shotgun your daddy got you.

216
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,066
别激动 哦 喔喔喔喔
Easy now. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

217
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,350
让我看看
Let me see that.

218
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:04,623
哦 我的天啊
Oh my goodness.

219
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:11,482
那些南方士兵最好小心来到这里
Those rebs best be careful coming around here.

220
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:16,483
哦
Oh.

221
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,626
威尔 把咖啡热一下
Will, warm up the coffee.

222
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,764
希望你们喜欢草莓酱
Hope you like strawberry jam.

223
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:35,564
今年春天我们只能种这了
That's all we could grow this spring.

224
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,548
哦 我肯定我们很喜欢
Oh, I'm sure we like it just fine.

225
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:43,518
在吃之前 伙计们 我们想先做个小小的祈祷
Before we dig in, boys, we like to have a little prayer.

226
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:45,798
让我们保持谦卑
Keep us humble.

227
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:48,894
主啊
Lord,

228
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:53,773
请俯视我们 帮助我们感谢
please look down on us and help us to be grateful

229
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:56,233
我们被给予的这些礼物
for these gifts that we have been given

230
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:59,053
帮助我们时刻关注
and help us to be always mindful

231
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:03,283
他人的需求 而不是只考虑自己
of the needs of others and not think only of ourselves.

232
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:06,643
我们祈祷 奉汝儿耶稣基督之名
We pray in the name of your son, Jesus Christ.

233
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,773
阿门 阿门
Amen. Amen.

234
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:09,715
好了
All right.

235
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:12,974
妈妈
Ma!

236
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:19,726
威尔 带你妹妹到炉子后面去 现在
Will, get behind the stove with your sister. Now!

237
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:34,185
一定是有什么误会 夫人
There must be some misunderstanding, ma'am.

238
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:36,315
我们怎么得罪了
How have we offended?

239
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,895
我不在我家招待杀手
I don't feed killers in my house.

240
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,002
杀手
Killers.

241
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,595
上帝啊
Good lord.

242
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:50,411
哦 哦 我看到了混乱
Oh, oh, I see the confusion.

243
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:52,931
伙计们 她说的是我们从拉勒米堡附近的
Boy, she is talking about those trophies

244
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:55,964
那个夏延商人那里得到的那些战利品
(夏延人: 美洲土著)
that we got off that Cheyenne trader near fort Laramie.

245
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,950
夫人 我意识到这是一个不体面的生意
Ma'am, I realize that's an unseemly business,

246
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,930
但当你在内地交易时
but those can be very valuable objects

247
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:04,420
这些可能是非常有价值的东西
when you're trading in the back country.

248
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:07,941
现在我们不能坐下来
Now can't we just sit back down

249
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,090
谈谈更愉快的事情吗
and talk about something more pleasant.

250
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:11,774
我们刚才聊得好开心
We were having such a nice time.

251
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:15,584
我认为你最好现在就走
I think it's best you go now.

252
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,289
我们到底在等什么
What the hell are we waiting for?

253
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,153
她仅有两发子弹
She's only got two rounds.

254
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,699
那就听你的
As you wish.

255
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,193
枪留下
And leave your guns.

256
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
我们会的
The hell we will.

257
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,249
夫人 我相信你知道
Ma'am, I'm sure you understand

258
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,962
这些武器有多贵重
how valuable these weapons are.

259
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,742
你可以用你的头皮换一些新的
You can trade your scalps for some new ones.

260
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:53,999
都听这女人的
You heard the woman.

261
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,877
这些是我爸爸的
Uh-uh, these were my pa's.

262
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:06,131
是在豌豆岭从他的尸体上取下来的
They took him off his dead body of Pea Ridge.

263
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:11,538
好吧
Fine.

264
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:22,511
我能拿回我的帽子吗
Can I have my hat?

265
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:25,258
威尔 给他帽子
Will, give him his hat.

266
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:22,048
驾
Hiyah!

267
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,456
来帮我
Help me.

268
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:07,621
推 推
Push! Push!

269
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,254
婊子养的
Son of a bitch!

270
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:48,171
蹲下
Ah, get down!

271
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:57,999
等一下 过来看看呀
Wait a sec! Come and see!

272
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:03,125
过来看看呀
Come and see! 

273
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:08,126
婊子养的
Son of a bitch!

274
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,394
哈 你到底在干什么
Hyah! What the hell are you doing?

275
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:12,812
我要他们活着
I want 'em alive!

276
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:19,850
喔 她的枪法烂如屎
Whoo! She can't shoot for Jack shit.

277
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,652
我需要你勇敢 好吗
I need you to be brave. Okay?

278
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:27,653
好的
Okay.

279
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,407
装弹
Reload.

280
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,517
照顾好你妹妹
Take care of your sister.

281
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,654
想要什么随便拿 然后离开
Just take what you want and go.

282
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,582
我们想要的是你
But what we want is you.

283
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,148
我什么都能干
I can do anything.

284
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:32,541
铺设轨道 射杀水牛 管理团队
Lay track, shoot buffalo, run the teams.

285
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:36,137
谢谢你的关注 麦卡利斯特先生
I appreciate the interest, Mr. McAllister.

286
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,057
根本没有工作的
There simply isn't the work.

287
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:40,577
我们有足够的人手来满足我们的需要
We have more than enough men to meet our needs.

288
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:41,957
肯定有些什么工作
There has to be something.

289
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,147
在篷车队帮忙也行
I could even help with the Chuck wagons.

290
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,487
哦 上帝 我们不是牛仔
Oh lord, we're not cowboys.

291
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,738
我们把食物沿铁路线带过来
We just bring our food up from down the line.

292
00:41:50,538 --> 00:41:52,248
日安 祝你好运
Good day. Best of luck.

293
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:21,242
你很好 没事的
You're all right. It's okay.

294
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,773
来吧
Here we go.

295
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
好了好了
Okay. Okay.

296
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:33,146
麦卡利斯特夫人
Mrs. McAllister.

297
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,273
藏好你妹妹
Hide your sister.

298
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:09,917
麦卡利斯特夫人 这太过了
Mrs. McAllister. That's far enough.

299
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:14,354
我很遗憾我们走错了路
I regret that we got off on the wrong foot.

300
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:19,577
我想我们可以重新开始 把事做好
I would like for us to start over, make it right.

301
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:24,102
没什么可说的
There's nothing to talk about,

302
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:27,016
除非你们这些人骑上马离开
except you men getting on your horses and riding off.

303
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:32,476
我尊重你的感受 我感同身受
I respect how you must be feeling and I can sympathize,

304
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:38,566
但这种对峙对任何人都没有好处
but this standoff not doing anybody a lick of good.

305
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:44,862
我确实在战争中以及战后
It's true that I've done my share of killing

306
00:43:44,863 --> 00:43:46,545
杀了些人
both during the war and after.

307
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:49,875
但有一件事我从没有干过
But one thing I ain't never done,

308
00:43:51,102 --> 00:43:53,505
我从没有伤害过一个女人一个小孩
I ain't never hurt a woman or a child.

309
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,412
我为什么要相信你说的
Why should I believe a word you say.

310
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:04,815
我曾经有一个女儿
I had a daughter once.

311
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:10,604
她是我唯一的孩子 我的掌上明珠
She was my only child, apple of my eye.

312
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:19,000
父亲能给予的每一分爱
Every bit of love and affection a father can give

313
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,624
我都倾注在了那个孩子身上
I lavished on that child.

314
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:26,504
她现在死了
She's dead now.

315
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:30,343
葬在了卡梅伦大道
Buried out Cameron way.

316
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,883
我对她的坟发誓
I swear on her grave,

317
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,959
我不会伤害你一丝一毫
I will not harm a hair on your head

318
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,610
不会伤害你孩子一丝一毫
or on the heads of your children.

319
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:55,219
该死
Dammit!

320
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,319
该死的蠢蛋
Damn fools!

321
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,668
你还好
You okay? You okay?

322
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:46,132
对不起 妈妈 我不是故意要叫醒她的
I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to wake her.

323
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:47,659
没关系
That's all right.

324
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,979
带她过来
Bring her here.

325
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,063
来吧 贝丝
Come on, Bess.

326
00:46:28,148 --> 00:46:29,828
他们要对黛西做什么
What are they doing with Daisy?

327
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:39,015
不
No.

328
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,430
不
No!

329
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,226
不
No.

330
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:15,436
对不起
Sorry.

331
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:22,924
现在 你按住他
Now, you hold him.

332
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:26,137
哦 见鬼 队长 它会自愈的
Oh, hell, captain, it'll heal itself.

333
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,073
它会自愈的 队长
It'll heal on its own, captain.

334
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:30,181
它会自愈的
It'll heal on its own.

335
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:32,727
耶稣 约瑟夫 玛丽 不
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, no.

336
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,905
不要亵渎神明
Please refrain from that papist blasphemy.

337
00:47:35,906 --> 00:47:37,130
打开他的袖子
Open his sleeve.

338
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:41,830
让他们都下地狱
Damn them all to hell! 

339
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:45,706
好吧 我想今世所有的苦难
Well I reckon that all the sufferings of this present age

340
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:47,635
都比不上荣耀
are not worthy compared to the glory,

341
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,002
荣耀将在我们身上显现
which shall be revealed in us.

342
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:59,226
一切都会好的
It's gonna be all right.

343
00:47:59,227 --> 00:48:03,450
爸爸不可能是南方士兵 妈妈 就是不可能
Pa couldn't have been reb, ma, just couldn't have been.

344
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:05,101
这就是你感到不安的事?
That's what you're upset about?

345
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:10,954
你爸爸不是叛军
Your pa's no rebel.

346
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,500
他可能开始时为南方而战
He may have begun fighting for the south,

347
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,353
但他以爱国者的身份结束了那场战争
but he ended that war a patriot.

348
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:20,904
但是你曾说他是...
But you said that he was-

349
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:23,105
好与坏并不总是那么清楚 威尔
good and bad aren't always so clear, will.

350
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,197
有时候 当你醒来时
Sometimes you wake up

351
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:28,199
你意识到自己做错了事
and you realize you're on the wrong side of things.

352
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
当你爸爸这样
And when you pa did,

353
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:32,279
他有勇气把事情做对
he have the courage to make things right.

354
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,663
他一贯如此
Just like he always does.

355
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:42,692
当他回来的时候
And when he comes back,

356
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,772
外面的那些杀手就会感受到上帝的愤怒
those killers outside are gonna feel god's wrath.

357
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:52,022
万一他们杀了他怎么办
What if they kill him instead?

358
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:20,371
最好吃光 儿子
Better eat up, son.

359
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,810
空着肚子很难勇敢
Hard to be brave on an empty belly.

360
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:33,270
嗯 队长 
Well, captain, there's,

361
00:49:35,877 --> 00:49:37,556
对发生的这一切 有些
there's just something about all this

362
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,170
我不是很明白
that I don't rightly understand.

363
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:44,556
接着说
Go on.

364
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:49,349
好吧 就是你说过不伤害妇女或儿童
Well, it's all you said about not hurting women or kids.

365
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:56,306
你认为我们应该坚持这一点
And you think we ought to stand by that.

366
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:07,434
你还记得你爸爸和我骑马出征
You remember when your pappy and I rode out

367
00:50:07,435 --> 00:50:11,004
保护我们的生活方式不受暴君林肯的影响
to defend our way of life from the tyrant Lincoln.

368
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:12,005
I do.

369
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:15,845
我们那时有很多好主意
We had a lot of fine ideas then

370
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:20,004
是关于骑士精神和荣誉的
about chivalry and honor

371
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:23,488
还有战争应该是什么样子
and what war should look like.

372
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:29,637
我们事业的正当性将如何使我们走向胜利
How the rightness of our cause would carry us to victory.

373
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:38,937
北方佬偷走了我们的牛
And the Yankees stole our cattle.

374
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:42,473
他们无缘无故地烧毁我们的农场
They burned our farms

375
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:46,287
吊死我们的亲属
and hung our kin without cause.

376
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,614
面对他们贪婪 凶残的仇恨
And all our fine notions were nothing

377
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:56,623
我们所有美好的想法都一文不值
in the face of their rapacious, murderous hatred.

378
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:07,976
他们夺走了我唯一的孩子
They took my only child from me,

379
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,102
把她从我的生活中夺走
ripped her from this life

380
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:18,535
没有丝毫仁慈与怜悯
without mercy or pity.

381
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:27,062
世上 天堂或地狱
And there ain't no law on earth

382
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:30,602
都没有法律
or in heaven or hell

383
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:37,854
可以阻止一个父亲复仇
that can keep a father from taking his revenge.

384
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:42,421
他既不是魔鬼
Not the devil

385
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:49,914
也不是上帝
And not god himself.

386
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:01,720
这么说让道理更明白些了吗
That make things any clearer?

387
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,850
见鬼 反正我们也不会伤害任何人
Hell, we ain't gonna have to hurt anybody anyway.

388
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,113
你是怎么想的
How you figure that?

389
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:24,142
麦卡利斯特夫人不适合这种生活
Mrs. McAllister ain't cut out for this kinda life.

390
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,162
我可以从她的眼神中看出这一点
I can tell that by looking in her eyes.

391
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:31,522
我们给她足够的时间
We give her enough time,

392
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:34,642
她就会来这里找我们
she's just gonna come on out here to us.

393
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,712
这是明智的做法
That's the sensible thing to do.

394
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:43,711
而她是个明智的女人
And she is a sensible woman.

395
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:45,201
队长  - 什么?
Captain! What?

396
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:49,228
见鬼
The hell.

397
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:52,527
该死
Damnation!

398
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,262
几英里内都能看到
They'll see that for miles.

399
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,806
妈妈!
Ma!

400
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:28,358
一直烧 明白吗?
Keep it burning, you understand?

401
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:29,877
找一切能烧的
Anything you can find.

402
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,305
看
Look.

403
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:09,315
威尔 你妹妹
Will, your sister.

404
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,526
来帮忙
Come to a help.

405
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,180
小孩们还在里面?
The children are still inside?

406
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,880
你一个人来的 邻居
You come alone, neighbor?

407
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,719
是的 我看到烟 就尽快赶过来了
Yeah, I see the smoke, I come riding real fast.

408
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,042
为什么这么问? 怎么回事
Why? What's wrong.

409
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:10,339
萨姆森先生 不要 去寻求帮助
Mr. Sameson, no, go get help.

410
00:56:13,238 --> 00:56:14,675
寻求帮助
Get help!

411
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:16,388
不 我要活的
No. I want him alive.

412
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:18,992
快走 萨姆森先生 快走
Ride, Mr. Sameson, ride!

413
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:07,234
让它烧
Let it burn!

414
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:09,690
你疯了吗  队长希望他们活着
Are you crazy? Captain wants them alive.

415
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:24,296
只是想帮忙
Just trying to help.

416
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,822
让他走
Let him go.

417
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:49,261
麦卡利斯特夫人 我很惊讶
Mrs. McAllister, I'm surprised.

418
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:52,745
大喊大叫并如此做事并不能使女人有尊严
It does not dignify a woman to holler and carry on such.

419
00:58:53,972 --> 00:58:55,622
他与你没有任何瓜葛
He hasn't done anything to you.

420
00:58:58,261 --> 00:58:59,761
嗯 完全正确
Well, that is entirely true.

421
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,821
但你也明白
But as you see,

422
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:06,964
你的固执使我们都陷入了困境
your obstinance has put us all in a difficult situation.

423
00:59:09,563 --> 00:59:12,750
所以我要再次请你出来
So I'm gonna ask you again to come out here

424
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:15,604
让我们像文明人一样解决当前问题
and let us resolve this like civilized people.

425
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,583
海蒂 你待在那儿
Hattie, you stay there.

426
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,360
他不是个好骗子
He's a no good liar.

427
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:22,361
不能相信他
He can't be trusted.

428
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:26,113
当然 你不开化的话
Of course, you'd rather not be civilized.

429
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,143
我将不得不求助于其它方法
I'll have to resort to other methods.

430
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,369
你不必这样做
You don't have to do this.

431
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:39,363
我希望不会 我是传教士的儿子
I'd hope not to. See, I'm a preacher's son.

432
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,869
我从小就相信这本好书
I was raised to believe in the good book.

433
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,933
这是唯一能阻止我们成为野蛮人的东西
It's the only thing that keeps us from being savages.

434
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,308
但即使是传教士的孩子也有他的极限
But even a preacher's boy has got his limits.

435
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:53,462
不要 他有老婆还有五个孩子
Please. He has a wife and five children.

436
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,328
主是我的牧者
The lord is my Shepherd.

437
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:58,329
我将一无所求
I shall not want.

438
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:00,448
你让我躺下
You made me to lay down.

439
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:02,338
我不喜欢重复自己
I don't like repeating myself.

440
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:03,172
主带我到平静的水边
He led me besides the still waters.

441
01:00:03,173 --> 01:00:07,138
麦卡利斯特夫人 所以我对你再说
Mrs. McAllister, so I'm gonna say this

442
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:08,312
最后一次
one more time.

443
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:10,309
现在出来
Come on out!

444
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,308
在死亡阴影的山谷中
In the valley of the shadow off death,

445
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,277
我将不惧怕任何邪恶
I will fear no evil.

446
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,305
不 不
No. No.

447
01:00:16,306 --> 01:00:18,095
因为你与我同在
For thou art with me.

448
01:02:21,893 --> 01:02:23,816
你把它丢在了街对面
You left it across the street.

449
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:28,022
看到了吧
See?

450
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:33,441
也许我最好下来 护送你过去
Maybe I best come down and escort you across.

451
01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:35,419
不 小姐 我很好
No, miss, I'm quite all right.

452
01:02:41,902 --> 01:02:45,025
嘿 你真的要醉醺醺地驾车回家吗
Hey. You really gonna drive home half liquored up?

453
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:48,140
我觉得你应该清醒清醒
Seems to me you ought to sober up

454
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:50,874
或者接着喝
or just go on, get drunk all the way.

455
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:54,837
我必须回到我的农场
I gotta get home to my farm.

456
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,044
农场? 你的农场不会想念你的
Farm? Your farm ain't gonna miss you.

457
01:02:59,031 --> 01:03:01,250
我们那儿有很好的床
We got real nice beds in there.

458
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:04,010
柔软的缎面床单
Soft satin sheets.

459
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:05,600
哦 你可以睡一整晚
Oh, you could sleep all night.

460
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:07,351
早上第一件事就是醒来
Wake up first thing in the morning.

461
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,490
当然 你也可以做些其它事情
Of course, you can do other things too.

462
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:13,123
我老婆
My wife.

463
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:14,563
-你老婆?    - 她在等我
- Your wife?   - She's waiting on me.

464
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:19,069
我知道你老婆
Something tells me your wife,

465
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,663
她不欣赏你
she don't appreciate you,

466
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:28,060
像你这样努力工作的人 不应该被如此对待
hard workin' man like you, not the way you deserve.

467
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:33,243
哦 好疼
Oh, geez!

468
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,900
通缉

469
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,500
通缉 杀人犯
赏金

470
01:03:52,085 --> 01:03:53,168
驾
Hyah!

471
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,941
我想是时候你该学会怎么煮咖啡了
I think it's time you learned how to make some coffee.

472
01:04:02,268 --> 01:04:03,518
首先 加一些水
First, put on some water.

473
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,690
接着我们需要磨碎一些豆子
Now we need to grind up some beans.

474
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,050
磨到像食盐一样才算好
You want 'em fine like table salt.

475
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:38,827
可以煮了吗?
Can we boil 'em?

476
01:04:39,707 --> 01:04:41,085
这可能就是牛手制作黑泥的方式
That may be how cow hands

477
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:42,705
他们称之为咖啡
make some black sludge they call coffee,

478
01:04:42,706 --> 01:04:44,265
但这不是正确的方法
but it's not the proper way.

479
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:45,915
那么 我们怎么做呢
Well, what do we do different?

480
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,266
磨得怎么样了
How's that grind looking?

481
01:04:54,526 --> 01:04:56,055
像盐
Just like salt.

482
01:04:56,056 --> 01:04:57,225
很好
Good.

483
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,326
找到我们可以用作过滤器的东西
Now find something we can use as a filter.

484
01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:30,284
现在我们等待它煮沸
Now we wait for it to boil.

485
01:05:32,384 --> 01:05:34,234
你想知道你爸爸和我是怎么认识的吗?
You wanna know how your pa and I met?

486
01:05:38,204 --> 01:05:41,054
在圣路易斯的时候 有一天 我放学回家
I was walking home from school one day back in St. Louis.

487
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:46,093
那是在战争期间 街道上到处都是士兵
It was during the war and the streets were full of soldiers.

488
01:05:46,094 --> 01:05:48,132
一群人决定要找点乐子
One bunch decided they wanted to have some fun.

489
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:51,942
他们就偷了我的书
So they stole my books.

490
01:05:51,943 --> 01:05:54,072
我恳求他们把书还给我
I begged and pleaded for them to give 'em back.

491
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:55,073
但他们不给
But they wouldn't.

492
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:59,112
我就开始哭了
And just when I started to cry,

493
01:05:59,113 --> 01:06:01,186
这时 我听到有人命令他们站住
I heard someone order those boys to stop.

494
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:05,412
我转过身 想着是一个中尉或上尉
I turned around expecting a lieutenant or a captain,

495
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:06,796
结果只是你爸
but it was just your pa.

496
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,515
他就一个人
He was all alone,

497
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:13,395
同样穿着士兵的制服
in a private's uniform no less.

498
01:06:15,432 --> 01:06:17,381
虽然是一个人对六个人
There was one man against six,

499
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:21,371
但他的声音里有某种特别的东西
but there was something in his voice,

500
01:06:21,372 --> 01:06:22,841
特别到他能轻松战胜
something that said he could still lick

501
01:06:22,842 --> 01:06:26,265
他们中的每一个人 一次一个或全部
every single one of them, one at a time or all together.

502
01:06:28,182 --> 01:06:30,341
当他们一个接一个地听到后
When they heard it, one by one,

503
01:06:30,342 --> 01:06:31,481
他们开始慢慢走开
they started to drift away

504
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:34,784
直到最后一个 把书还给了我 并向我道歉
till the last one, gave me back my books and apologized.

505
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:42,010
你爸爸问我是否要送我回家
Your pa asked me if he could walk me home.

506
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:45,404
我说好 但在我心中 我已经知道
I said, yes, but in my heart, I already knew.

507
01:06:48,007 --> 01:06:49,007
知道什么
Knew what?

508
01:06:53,379 --> 01:06:56,711
知道他就是我要嫁的人
That he was the man I wanted to marry.

509
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:01,089
知道世上没有什么能让他放弃
That nothing in this world could ever cause him to give up

510
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,513
无论面对什么 他都会站起来保护我
and whatever would come, he would stand up and protect me.

511
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:14,623
好了 现在用开水去冲咖啡粉 慢点儿
All right, now pour it over the beans, nice and slow.

512
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,538
再加点冰糖怎么样
How about some more rock candy?

513
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:39,488
不能欺骗你的黑咖啡 能吗
Can't trick your coffee black, can you?

514
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:01,447
威尔 威尔
Will. Will!

515
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,217
我要你来盯着
I need you to keep watch.

516
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:13,507
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

517
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:24,849
呲 呲
Psst, psst!

518
01:08:28,176 --> 01:08:29,176
妈妈
Ma!

519
01:08:32,586 --> 01:08:33,586
别开枪
Don't shoot.

520
01:08:35,136 --> 01:08:36,279
我是来谈话的
I just come the talk.

521
01:08:38,676 --> 01:08:40,315
你要乱动
You so much as flinch

522
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,539
我发誓 我会用一颗子弹打穿你的心脏
and I swear, I'll put a bullet through your heart.

523
01:08:43,476 --> 01:08:44,476
我没带武器
I ain't armed.

524
01:08:46,446 --> 01:08:48,334
正中你的心脏
Right through your heart.

525
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:49,335
别这样
Please.

526
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:54,107
其他人不知道我来
The others don't know I come.

527
01:08:54,108 --> 01:08:55,158
你能听我说吗
Will you just listen?

528
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:59,025
好吧 你说
All right. Talk then.

529
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:03,664
这不是我想干的
This ain't what I thought I was joining.

530
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:06,484
我们本来是要抢银行和火车
We was supposed to rob banks and trains,

531
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,318
而不是伤害妇女和儿童
not hurt women and children.

532
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:12,834
这活儿不再适合我了
It just don't sit right with me no more.

533
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:16,383
你支持我 那为什么杀了我的邻居
You stood by why I killed my neighbor.

534
01:09:16,384 --> 01:09:18,573
如果我真的说了什么
If I'd done said anything,

535
01:09:18,574 --> 01:09:20,374
我也会死在地上
I'd be lying dead on the ground too.

536
01:09:23,134 --> 01:09:25,143
我记得我妈妈曾经警告过我
I remember my mama once warned me

537
01:09:25,144 --> 01:09:27,127
不要和坏人交往
about falling in with bad company.

538
01:09:28,714 --> 01:09:30,993
一旦我入伙 我没有意识到
Once I did, I didn't realize

539
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,706
分道扬镳有多难
how hard it would be to part ways.

540
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:36,006
他们是谁
Who are they?

541
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:39,024
他们是密苏里州的一伙人
They're a gang from Missouri.

542
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:42,902
战争期间 他们与袭击匡特里尔的人混在一起
They rode with Quantrill's raiders during the war.

543
01:09:42,903 --> 01:09:44,736
队长是他的得力助手
Captain was his right hand man.

544
01:09:46,413 --> 01:09:49,562
当老匡特里尔人被杀或投降后
Most of the fellers gave up 

545
01:09:49,663 --> 01:09:51,602
大部分人都弃甲归田了
when old quantrill was killed or after the surrender.

546
01:09:51,603 --> 01:09:52,746
但队长没有
But not captain.

547
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:55,355
对他来说 战争永远没有结束
The war ain't never ended for him.

548
01:10:00,272 --> 01:10:02,705
听着 如果我帮你
Look, if I help you,

549
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:06,895
你会和我们马歇尔一起为我创造一个美好的世界吗
will you put in a good world with the us Marshall for me?

550
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,855
那好 这是我的计划
Right then, here's my plan.

551
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:16,290
其他人都在睡觉时 我要站岗
The others are sleeping and I'm supposed to be on watch.

552
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:19,080
如果你和孩子们能设法到窗外
If you and the young ones can get out of the window,

553
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,600
我会在一百步之外与你会面
I'll meet you back about a hundred paces.

554
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:22,601
我带马过来
I'll bring horses.

555
01:10:24,331 --> 01:10:25,800
别惊醒他们
You can get 'em without waking them.

556
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:27,801
马鞍我都收拾好了
I already done got 'em all saddled up.

557
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:36,661
我会让孩子们准备好
I'll get the children ready.

558
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:39,293
我们10分钟后见面
We'll meet you in 10 minutes.

559
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:43,628
好的
All right.

560
01:10:43,629 --> 01:10:44,517
谢谢你
Thank you.

561
01:10:44,518 --> 01:10:47,980
在被发觉之前 我们可以骑马溜出去
And we can ride on out afore anyone's wiser

562
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,193
然后去找杰比
and then go find Jeb.

563
01:10:57,539 --> 01:10:59,372
杰德 王八蛋
Jed! Son of a bitch!

564
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:02,792
她搞死他了 队长
She got him, captain.

565
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:06,602
现在我得告诉他妈妈
Now I gotta tell his mama!

566
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:10,708
那个该死的蠢货根本不会撒谎
That dang fool kid couldn't lie for shit!

567
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:12,088
讲话当心点
You mind your tongue.

568
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:14,402
妈 他只是想帮忙
Ma, he was just trying to help!

569
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:22,202
我从来没有告诉他你爸爸的名字 一次也没有
I never told him your pa's name, not one time.

570
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,888
那他们是怎么知道的
Then how did they know it?

571
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,597
他们不是来找我们的
They're not after us.

572
01:11:27,598 --> 01:11:29,098
他们是来找你爸的
They came looking for your pa.

573
01:11:32,638 --> 01:11:35,247
这就是为什么他们在那里消磨时间
That's why they're out there taking their time.

574
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:37,497
这就是为什么他们现在在那里干等着
That's why they're out there now waiting.

575
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:38,498
我们只是诱饵
We're just the bait.

576
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:41,541
你父亲正走进一个陷阱
Your father's walking into a trap.

577
01:11:42,748 --> 01:11:46,989
威尔 我需要你做点什么
Will, I'm gonna need you to do something.

578
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,830
你必须勇敢地去做
And you're gonna have to be brave to do it.

579
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,307
我需要你把马弄来
I need you to get the filly.

580
01:11:54,807 --> 01:11:57,919
什么 不 我做不到
What? No, I can't.

581
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,473
是的 你能
Yes, you can.

582
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:01,170
你是你父亲的儿子
You're your father's son.

583
01:12:03,177 --> 01:12:05,140
轮到我们保护他了
It's our turn to protect him.

584
01:13:10,964 --> 01:13:15,963
北方佬小混蛋
That little yankee bastard! 

585
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,257
他们带走了那个北方佬混蛋
They took that yankee bastard

586
01:13:40,258 --> 01:13:42,684
他们朝他的头部开枪
they shot him in the head

587
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,352
他们把他放在火上烤
they put him on the fire

588
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,936
这样 妈妈就能看到他死了
so if mama saw he's dead

589
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:54,878
嘘
Sh!

590
01:13:59,282 --> 01:14:01,031
好了 好了
It's okay. It's okay.

591
01:14:06,348 --> 01:14:08,905
北方佬去了巴尔的摩
The yankee's went to Baltimore

592
01:14:08,906 --> 01:14:12,573
他们遇到一匹母马
and they came upon a mare

593
01:14:51,317 --> 01:14:53,082
见鬼 队长
Hell, captain,

594
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:56,613
马跑了 向着王国
the horses are running to kingdom come!

595
01:14:56,614 --> 01:14:59,237
你去抓她
You get her!

596
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:01,829
哦 搞什么呀
Oh, come on.

597
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:12,784
王八蛋 都回来
Son of a bitch! Get back here.

598
01:15:15,338 --> 01:15:17,811
威尔 威尔
Will! Will!

599
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:20,178
想着你会跑
Think you're going.

600
01:15:22,765 --> 01:15:26,061
知道吗 队长他先前不想伤害你
You know, captain, he didn't mean you no harm before,

601
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:28,371
但现在想了
but he does now.

602
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:38,009
冷静
Easy.

603
01:15:44,894 --> 01:15:46,515
不 不
No! No!

604
01:15:46,516 --> 01:15:50,522
不 不
No! No!

605
01:15:50,523 --> 01:15:53,816
别动 明白吗
You don't move. You understand me?

606
01:15:53,817 --> 01:15:55,067
别动
Don't you move!

607
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:59,403
哦 我的天 她划我的脸
Oh my god, my god, she got my face!

608
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:01,862
威尔 快跑
Will, run!

609
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:03,604
她划我的脸
She got my face!

610
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:06,198
天呀 她扎我的脸
God, she got my damn face!

611
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:08,366
威尔 跑 快跑
Will, run! Run!

612
01:17:57,817 --> 01:17:58,900
快跑 妈妈
Go, run! Ma!

613
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,093
快走 带着她
Go! Take her!

614
01:18:03,935 --> 01:18:04,768
你快跑 带着她
You run, just take her.

615
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:07,293
去丹尼尔森家 快走
Go to the Danielsons. Go! 

616
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:08,791
快走
Go! Go!

617
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:13,605
你过来
Come here, you!

618
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:20,508
过来 我抓到你了
Come here, I got you!

619
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:25,509
我们离开这儿 走啊
Get out of there! Let go!

620
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:28,303
你去哪里了?
Where'd you go?

621
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:32,637
快出来 我不会伤害你的
Come on out, I won't hurt ya.

622
01:18:39,202 --> 01:18:40,202
婊子
Bitch!

623
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,311
你在那儿做了一件该死的傻事
That was a damn fool thing you done back there.

624
01:19:04,568 --> 01:19:06,101
差点害死自己
Almost got yourself killed.

625
01:19:07,628 --> 01:19:11,077
我告诉过你 我从来没有伤害过一个女人
I told you, I ain't never harmed a woman.

626
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,117
队长 我们什么时候去找那个北方佬小混蛋?
Captain, when we gonna go get that little yankee bastard?

627
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:14,976
你闭嘴
Shut your mouth.

628
01:19:14,977 --> 01:19:16,827
这里有我们需要的一切
We got everything we need right here.

629
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:21,006
我们要做的就是 在麦卡利斯特夫人死在野外之前
All we gotta do is get Mrs. McAllister back home

630
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:22,961
带她回家
before she catches her death out here.

631
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:24,156
那好 但你先前说我要抓住他
Yeah, but you told me I could get him

632
01:19:24,157 --> 01:19:25,386
带他回来 砍掉他的...
and bring him back here and cut his-

633
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:28,036
闭上你的臭嘴
shut your belly achin' rotten mouth!

634
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:50,176
敢动一下 要你的命
You move, you die.

635
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:08,104
你想知道你的肉被烧掉是什么感觉吗?
You want to see how it feels to get your flesh burned off?

636
01:20:08,105 --> 01:20:09,428
绅士点儿 伙计们
Gentle does it, boys.

637
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:19,354
正如传道书所说
As it says in Ecclesiastes:

638
01:20:19,355 --> 01:20:21,243
将你的面包撒在水里
(意为: 人要乐于助人行善)
Cast thy bread upon the waters

639
01:20:21,244 --> 01:20:23,917
因为日久必能找得到
(因为行善之人终归会有回报)
for thou shalt find it after many days.

640
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:45,553
杰比
Jeb!

641
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:48,916
想死吗?
Care to die?

642
01:20:55,773 --> 01:20:57,973
这不是开始对话的方式
This ain't no way to start a conversation.

643
01:20:59,643 --> 01:21:00,786
让她走 米勒
Let her go, Miller.

644
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:03,876
对你来说 应该叫米勒队长
It's captain Miller to you.

645
01:21:05,283 --> 01:21:07,332
如果你能记住这一点 我将不胜感激
I'd appreciate it if you'd remember that.

646
01:21:13,322 --> 01:21:14,522
我的孩子们在哪里?
Where are my children?

647
01:21:16,112 --> 01:21:17,341
他们很安全
They're safe.

648
01:21:17,342 --> 01:21:18,842
他们都在河那边
They made it across the river.

649
01:21:22,352 --> 01:21:24,752
你仍然称自己为联邦军官
You still call yourself a confederate officer.

650
01:21:25,862 --> 01:21:27,962
你没有权利关押一位妇女囚犯
You got no right to hold a woman prisoner.

651
01:21:30,038 --> 01:21:32,610
"因为男人要离开父母"
"For a man shall leave his father and mother"

652
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,080
"依附妻子"
"and cleave unto his wife."

653
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:36,180
"他们必成为一体"
"And they shall be as one flesh."

654
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:39,090
创世记 第二章第24节
Genesis chapter two, 24th verse.

655
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:42,180
杰比迪亚·麦卡利斯特 你的罪已经发现了你
Your sins have found you out, Jebediah McAllister,

656
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:44,644
它们会降临到你的全家
and now they are visited upon your whole family.

657
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:57,670
你想要什么
What do you want?

658
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,439
复仇
Vengeance.

659
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,689
复仇是主之事 米勒
Vengeance belongs to the lord, Miller.

660
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,883
主花的时间太他妈长了
Well, the lord takes too damn long.

661
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:11,279
我知道我说的不太清楚
Now I can see that I am being less than clear.

662
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,543
我就直说了吧
So let me be blunt.

663
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:17,008
要么你放下枪
You either put that gun down

664
01:22:17,009 --> 01:22:18,208
要么你老婆的眼珠
or your pretty little wife

665
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,612
从头上被挖出来
is gonna have her eyes cut out of her head.

666
01:22:22,049 --> 01:22:23,852
你说你从不伤害女人
You said you never hurt a woman.

667
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:28,472
我没有 是他说的
I haven't, but he has.

668
01:22:33,299 --> 01:22:36,057
我女儿埋在坟墓中
My daughter has laid

669
01:22:36,058 --> 01:22:38,757
已经12年了
in her grave for 12 years,

670
01:22:38,758 --> 01:22:41,667
而谋杀她的人却依然自由行走
while her murderers have walked free.

671
01:22:41,668 --> 01:22:43,797
我们没有谋杀任何人
We didn't murder anyone.

672
01:22:43,798 --> 01:22:44,728
那是个意外
It was an accident.

673
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:45,871
她信任你
She trusted you.

674
01:22:47,578 --> 01:22:50,427
她信任你 因为你是她的同胞
She trusted you because you were her countryman.

675
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:54,151
没有一个人知道她在里面 不信问他
Not one man there knew she was inside. Ask him!

676
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:59,430
那里没有一个人还有呼吸 除了你
Not one man there draws breath, except you.

677
01:23:02,307 --> 01:23:04,020
我们以为是你在里面
We thought it was you in there.

678
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,970
不是 只有我的宝贝
No, only my heart.

679
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:20,365
慢慢来
Make it slow.

680
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:22,789
杰比
Jeb! 

681
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:28,705
你发个誓 "你不会伤害她 你会让她走"
You swear, you won't hurt her. You'll let her go.

682
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:30,745
不 不 杰比
No, no, Jeb!

683
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:32,249
以我孩子的坟墓发誓
On my child's grave.

684
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:35,416
你不能相信他
You can't trust him.

685
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,416
不
No.

686
01:23:45,206 --> 01:23:46,623
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no!

687
01:23:55,549 --> 01:23:56,549
不 不
No, no!

688
01:23:58,132 --> 01:24:01,848
现在是不是没有更多的小混蛋了
Ain't having no more little bastards now!

689
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:09,049
希望你不介意 杰比迪亚
Hope you don't mind, Jebediah.

690
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,776
这是我的荣幸
The pleasure's all mine.

691
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:12,223
你个王八蛋
You son of a bitch!

692
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,937
起来 公主
Come on, Princess!

693
01:24:33,863 --> 01:24:37,686
他女儿的事? 你为什么从不告诉我
His daughter? Why did you never tell me.

694
01:24:40,153 --> 01:24:43,256
如果我不得不为联邦杀人 那已经够糟糕了
Bad enough if I had to kill men for the confederacy,

695
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,462
我还为邦联谋杀了一个孩子
I murdered a child for the union.

696
01:24:46,463 --> 01:24:48,263
那不是谋杀 你不知道
It wasn't murder. You didn't know.

697
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,485
对他来说无所谓
It doesn't matter to him.

698
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,051
当他完成他要做的事情时
When he finishes what he is gonna do,

699
01:24:57,052 --> 01:25:00,047
你骑马离开这里 不要回头
you ride outta here and don't look back.

700
01:25:00,048 --> 01:25:02,631
我不会离开 无论现在还是将来
I'm not leaving, now or ever.

701
01:26:03,839 --> 01:26:05,539
嗯 麦卡利斯特夫人
Well. Mrs. McAllister,

702
