1
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,812
神看见人在地上的罪恶甚大。
And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth.

2
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:48,245
他心中所想的每一种想象都是邪恶的。
And that every imagination of the thoughts in his heart was only evil continually.

3
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:57,862
耶和华后悔造人在地上，就心里愁烦。
And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved his heart.

4
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,760
耶和华说、我要灭绝一个人。
And the Lord said, "I will destroy a man"

5
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:07,923
我在地上所造的一切。
that I have created on the face of the earth.

6
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:14,430
"因为我后悔是我造成的"
"For it repenteth me that I have made them."

7
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:18,326
创世纪6:5-7。
Book of Genesis 6:5-7.

8
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:30,073
这就够了。
That's enough.

9
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,847
我说，够了。
I said, that's enough.

10
00:03:58,323 --> 00:03:59,976
我道歉,吉迪恩。
I apologize, Gideon.

11
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:06,923
如果说礼仪造就人，那么我身边就有一群孩子。
If manners maketh man, I have surrounded myself with boys.

12
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,369
你看起来需要喝一杯。
You look like you could use a drink.

13
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:32,596
嘿。
Hey.

14
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:36,970
你知道我是谁吗?
Do you know who I am?

15
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:37,971
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

16
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,575
那你就知道我为什么来了。
Then you know why I'm here.

17
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:54,187
你的眼泪，是你的功劳。
Your tears, they do you credit.

18
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:56,647
他们显示悔悟。
They show contrition.

19
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:04,784
我毫不怀疑上帝会通过他儿子的血宽恕你。
And I have no doubt that God will forgive you through the blood of his Son.

20
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:09,396
但我不是上帝。
But I ain't God.

21
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:13,731
去死吧，你个狗娘养的。
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

22
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,444
噢!
Ooh!

23
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:16,524
接他!
Pick him up!

24
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,993
地狱,儿子。住在这。
Hell, son. Live in it.

25
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:21,042
来了，亲爱的女孩。它的到来。
It's coming, sweet girl. It's coming.

26
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:50,714
Sh。
Sh.

27
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:07,074
起床喜洋洋
Rise and shine

28
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:48,016
咖啡。
Coffee.

29
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:55,366
是的,是的,是的。
Yep, yep, yep.

30
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:01,984
准备好了吗?
Ready?

31
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,949
发生了什么。什么错了吗?
What's going on. What wrong?

32
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,450
想要你的床吗?
Hm, want your bed?

33
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,461
保持冷静。好吧?
Be calm. Okay?

34
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:30,232
Sh, sh.

35
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,624
没关系。
Sh, sh! It's okay.

36
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,222
没关系。没关系。
It's all right. It's all right.

37
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:02,236
给我。
Give me that.

38
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:07,567
不叫我们遇见试探，救我们脱离凶恶。
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

39
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,096
阿们。阿们。
Amen. Amen.

40
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:12,957
在我们失去更多鸡之前，你去追捕那只该死的土狼。
You go hunt down that damn coyote, before we lose any more of our chickens.

41
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:23,144
嗯,爸爸?
Uh, Pa?

42
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,258
我能和你一起去打猎吗?
Can I come hunt with you?

43
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:28,776
问你的马。
Ask your ma.

44
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:30,490
好吧,我能吗?
Well, can I?

45
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:36,617
我可以吗?
Can I?

46
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,728
如果你做完家务。
If you finish your chores.

47
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:51,473
打扫我的床，喂贝丝。
Gotta clean my bed, feed Bess.

48
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:02,170
这是什么?
What's this?

49
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,821
妈妈给我的。
Ma gave it to me.

50
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:08,681
她说你在700码外射杀了一名红衣少校。
She said you shot a red major clean off his horse at 700 yards.

51
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:15,160
我想她说过我可以从700码外的马背上射下一个红衣长官。
I think she said I could shoot a red major off his horse 700 yards.

52
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:17,148
我不能。
I can't.

53
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:18,888
没有人能做到。
Nobody can.

54
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,777
但你确实杀了杀了雷布。
But you did kill kill Rebs.

55
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:24,811
这可不是什么礼貌的谈话，孩子。
It ain't polite conversation, son.

56
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,465
你是个神枪手?
You were a sharp shooter?

57
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,177
我还是个神枪手，小子。
I'm still a sharp shooter, boy.

58
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,671
永远不要忘记。晚安。
Don't you ever forget it. Goodnight.

59
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:58,091
哈蒂·麦卡利斯特，谁能想到呢?
Hattie McAllister, who would've thought?

60
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:10,558
烤辫子的时候，我们常常在你爸爸的店里吃糖果，看书想着有一天我们会在这个狂野的国家拥有最好的辫子。
Grilling pigtails, we used to eat candy and read books in the back of your daddy's store that someday we'd be homesteading this wild country with the best of them.

61
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:16,259
我们能逃出去吗?
Are we gonna make it out here?

62
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,822
只要有一点勇气。
Just gotta have a little grit.

63
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:21,071
我都不知道去哪儿找了。
I don't know where to find that anymore.

64
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:24,277
相信你做的事。
Sure you do.

65
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,278
我知道。
I know.

66
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,375
内心深处，你是这片土地上最坚强的女人。
Deep down, you're the toughest woman in this territory.

67
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:06,164
爸爸在半英里外打死了那只郊狼。
Pa shot that coyote from half mile away.

68
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,720
大概有100码吧。
Oh, it was more like 100 yards.

69
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:19,300
天啊,帽子。到底发生了什么?
Good Lord, Hat. What the hell happened?

70
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,277
马?
Ma?

71
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:44,024
孩子睡了，晚饭也准备好了。
Boy's down. Supper's put away.

72
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:48,490
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

73
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,460
他们一定是在居留地外找什么东西。
They must have wandered off the reservation looking for something.

74
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:52,461
没有取消。
Got no scrap.

75
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:04,823
我想回家。
I want to go home.

76
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:10,540
好吧，如果你想见你父母，我可以在铁路公司找份工作。
All right, if you wanna see your folks, reckon I can get a work with the railroad.

77
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,541
给你买张票。
Buy you a ticket.

78
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:13,543
我不想要票。
I don't want a ticket.

79
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:18,644
我想收拾行李带着我们的孩子离开这个被上帝遗弃的地方。
I want to pack the wagon and take our children out of this God forsaken place.

80
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,760
我知道这很难，但这里是好地方。
I know it's been hard, but this here's good land.

81
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,204
我们住在小屋里杰布
We live in a shack, Jeb.

82
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:33,401
我们有旧的工具，破旧的牲畜，只能用从商店贷款借来的食物来养活我们的孩子。
We've got old tools, worn out live stock, and can only feed our children with food borrowed off store credit.

83
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:37,874
我知道这很艰难。
I understand it's been tough.

84
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:42,730
但这是我们的梦想，海蒂。
But this is our dream, Hattie.

85
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:46,851
这就是我们要做的，在我们自己的土地上建造一个家。
This is what we set out to do, build a home on land we can call our own.

86
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:50,472
我想让你去找我爸爸找份工作。
I want you to ask my daddy for a job.

87
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:55,330
你想让我们回到他身边吗?
You want us to crawl back to him?

88
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,011
我们靠自己是做不到的。
We can't make it on our own.

89
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,462
当然，我们可以。我们只需要继续前进。
Hell, yes, we can. We just gotta keep on going.

90
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:02,891
好吧,我不能。
Well, I can't.

91
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:17,951
这很好。
That's good.

92
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:26,501
我要进城去，拿些补给。
I'm gonna ahead into town, grab supplies.

93
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,335
做一个坚强的男孩。
Be a strong boy.

94
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:30,458
我在城里的时候，你要照顾你妈妈，好吗?
Look after your mom while I'm in town, won't ya?

95
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:44,947
在这里,Pa。
Here, Pa.

96
00:22:06,245 --> 00:22:10,952
杰布。嗨呀,走吧!
Jeb. Hiyah, go!

97
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,801
我认为这是我们应得的。
I think we've earned it.

98
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:52,606
爸爸说糖果是一种真正的享受，只有在圣诞节和葬礼上才有。
Pa says candy's a real treat, just for Christmas and funerals.

99
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:57,766
我小时候住在圣路易斯，我们每周都吃糖。
When I was a girl in St. Louis, we'd have candy every week.

100
00:22:58,603 --> 00:22:59,982
真的吗?
Really?

101
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:06,101
夏天吃冰淇淋，秋天吃太妃糖，圣诞节吃薄荷棒。
We'd have ice cream in the summer, toffee in the fall and peppermint sticks at Christmas.

102
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,703
你会喜欢住在那里的。
You would've loved living there.

103
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:13,402
爷爷奶奶不让你嫁给爸爸，是真的吗?
Is it true that Granny and Gramps didn't want you to marry Pa?

104
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:18,072
他们只是对我想要什么有自己的想法。
They just had their own ideas about what they wanted for me.

105
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:22,271
但爸爸是个英雄。他保卫密苏里不被叛军占领。
But PA's a hero. He defended Missouri from the Rebs.

106
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:23,599
你爸是叛军。
Your pa was a Reb.

107
00:23:25,693 --> 00:23:27,943
他曾用它来联合起来拯救联邦。
He used it to be join up to save the Union.

108
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:32,072
那时候的事情并不简单。
Things weren't simple back then.

109
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:35,183
Will.

110
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,712
我可能会给你一个美好的早晨，女士。
I might fine morning to you, ma'am.

111
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:13,362
和你。
And to you.

112
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:17,446
不知道能不能麻烦你给我们点水。
I wonder if we might trouble you for some of your water.

113
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:22,062
我们的坐骑快干了，我们也好不到哪里去。
Our mounts are about dried out and we're not much better.

114
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,413
你想拿多少就拿多少。
Take as much as you like.

115
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:25,817
感谢。
Much obliged.

116
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:41,033
Will.

117
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:51,853
你怎么了，孩子。
What's the matter with you, son.

118
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,704
你妈没教你什么礼貌吗?
Didn't your ma teach you any manners?

119
00:24:55,813 --> 00:25:00,716
我听说你没有妈妈，从妓女那里辍学，被毛皮商养大。
You didn't have no ma, dropped out of a whore and raised by those fur traders, is what I heard.

120
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,516
非常抱歉，夫人。
I do apologize, ma'am.

121
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:10,603
到现在为止，我们已经有三个月左右的时间了，恐怕这一点已经开始显现出来了。
We have been in the saddle for about three months now and I'm afraid it is beginning to show.

122
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:19,453
我没办法，但是注意到你那边的鸡笼，我，我在想我能不能买些腌猪肉或者一打鸡蛋。
Um, I couldn't help, but notice your coop over yonder, I, I wonder if I might offer to buy some salt pork and maybe a dozen eggs.

123
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:20,854
你需要多少就拿多少。
Fetch as many as you need.

124
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:24,995
好。
Well.

125
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:31,067
我必须承认，我觉得和一位女士谈生意有点鲁莽。
I must confess, I, I do feel a bit forward talking business with a lady.

126
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,796
你丈夫在家吗?
Uh, is your husband at home?

127
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:38,027
他不是在这里。他进城去了。
He ain't here. He gone to town.

128
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:46,104
哦，好吧，我想那你就是家里的男人了。
Oh, well then I guess that makes you the man of the house, I reckon.

129
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:58,547
哦，还有一件事。
Oh, uh, one more thing.

130
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:02,473
我听出来你是密苏里口音吗。
Is that a Missouri accent that I detect.

131
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:03,733
圣路易斯。
St. Louis.

132
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:07,183
我知道它。真是太巧了。
I knew it. What a happy coincidence.

133
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:14,462
我自己也是卡梅伦派的，那边那个大块头，他来自阿肯色州，但我们尽量不以此为借口。
I am a Cameron man, myself, that big fella over there, he's from Arkansas, but we try not to hold that against it.

134
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:19,183
密苏里州这边来的人不多。
We don't get many Missourians out this way.

135
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:20,837
不，夫人，我想你不知道。
No, ma'am, I expect you don't.

136
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:35,129
我很乐意在你们走之前给你们做点早餐。
I'd be happy to cook you men some breakfast before you go.

137
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:39,527
好吧，我们将不胜感激。
Well, we would be much obliged.

138
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:51,624
您真是太好了，夫人。
This is very kind of you, ma'am.

139
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:07,033
那边是你的家人吗，太太?
Those your folks over there, Mrs. Uh?

140
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:08,563
麦卡利斯特。麦卡利斯特。
McAllister. McAllister.

141
00:27:08,564 --> 00:27:11,538
海蒂。这是贝丝，这是威尔。
Hattie. This is Bess and this is Will.

142
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:13,525
设置表。
Set the table.

143
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:18,794
你多大了?
How old are you?

144
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:20,894
九又四分之三。
Nine and three quarters.

145
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:24,497
那么，我想它应该够大，可以戴这个了。
Why then, I reckon that's big enough to wear one of these.

146
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:34,183
你的家真漂亮，麦卡利斯特太太。
This is a lovely home you have here, Mrs. McAllister.

147
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:35,688
你丈夫是个幸运的人。
Your husband is a lucky man.

148
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:48,644
她想说话。
She wants to talk.

149
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:50,508
哦，现在，让我来。
Oh, now here, allow me.

150
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,875
我这辈子就抱过两岁的孩子。
I've held a baby at two in my life.

151
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,614
是的。你没事吧?
Yeah. You okay?

152
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:58,615
是的。
Yeah.

153
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:18,043
现在永远的迪克西她永远不会不知所措与鹰一起坠落与十字架一起向上。
Now Dixie forever She's never at a loss Down with the eagle Up with the cross.

154
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:28,904
我们将重新团结在旗帜周围，孩子们我们将再次团结在一起喊，喊自由的战斗口号
We will rally around the flag, boys We'll rally 'round again Shout, shout the battle cry of Freedom

155
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:39,703
现在永远的迪克西她从未失去过什么，贝丝。
Now Dixie forever She's never had a loss Bess.

156
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:45,041
下了老鹰，上了十字架我要去拿些鸡蛋。
Down with the eagle And up with the cross Gonna go fetch some eggs.

157
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:50,305
我们会团结在旗帜周围，男孩们我们会再次团结起来耶。来吧。
We will rally round the flag, boys We'll rally 'round again Yeah. Come on.

158
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:56,565
呼喊，呼喊，自由的战斗口号嘿，嘿。嘿。
Shout shout The battle cry of freedom Hey, Hey. Hey.

159
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,678
那是瑞贝卡的歌吗?
Is that a Reb song?

160
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,925
得教她那首歌。
Need to teach her that song.

161
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:14,295
你以前从没听过这首歌。
You never heard that song before.

162
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,379
你喜欢那首歌吗?
You like that song?

163
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:08,076
快乐的女孩现在，嘟，嘟
Happy girl now, doo, doo

164
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,193
她是个多么温柔的小女孩啊。
What a gentle little soul she is.

165
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:20,810
你对雷布没什么意见，对吧，孩子。
You ain' got a problem with Rebs, now do you, boy.

166
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:27,495
我们年轻的主人是在战争结束后出生的。
Our young host was born after hostilities ended.

167
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:30,290
我相信他是个自豪的美国人，对吧，孩子。
I'm sure he's a proud American, aren't you, boy.

168
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:35,745
这没有错，人应该忠于自己的国家。
Nothing wrong with that, man should be loyal to his own country.

169
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:36,746
不是每个人都是。
Not everybody is.

170
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,905
我爸爸是个神枪手。
My daddy was a sharp shooter.

171
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:41,906
他现在吗?
Was he now?

172
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:45,795
威尔的枪法也不错。
Will's not a bad shot himself.

173
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:49,127
不如你去给这些先生们看看你爸爸给你买的猎枪。
Why don't you go show these gentlemen that shotgun your daddy got you.

174
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,945
放松
Easy now. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

175
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,229
让我看看。
Let me see that.

176
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,504
哦我的天哪。
Oh my goodness.

177
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:11,362
那些叛军来这里最好小心点。
Those Rebs best be careful coming around here.

178
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:16,364
哦。
Oh.

179
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,506
威尔，把咖啡热一下。
Will, warm up the coffee.

180
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:33,646
希望你喜欢草莓酱。
Hope you like strawberry jam.

181
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:35,446
今年春天我们只能种这个了。
That's all we could grow this spring.

182
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:37,429
我相信我们都很喜欢。
Oh, I'm sure we like it just fine.

183
00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:43,400
在开饭之前，孩子们，我们想先祈祷一下。
Before we dig in, boys, we like to have a little prayer.

184
00:31:44,657 --> 00:31:45,679
我们保持谦卑。
Keep us humble.

185
00:31:47,777 --> 00:32:03,166
主啊，求你看顾我们，帮助我们感谢上帝赐予我们的这些恩赐，帮助我们时刻留意别人的需要，而不是只考虑自己。
Lord, please look down on us and help us to be grateful for these gifts that we have been given and help us to be always mindful of the needs of others and not think only of ourselves.

186
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,526
我们以你儿子耶稣基督的名义祈祷。
We pray in the name of your son, Jesus Christ.

187
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:08,656
阿们。阿们。
Amen. Amen.

188
00:32:08,657 --> 00:32:09,598
好吧。
All right.

189
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,859
马!
Ma!

190
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:19,610
威尔，和你妹妹到炉子后面去。现在!
Will, get behind the stove with your sister. Now!

191
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:34,070
一定是有什么误会，夫人。
There must be some misunderstanding, ma'am.

192
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:36,200
我们得罪了谁?
How have we offended?

193
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:41,780
我不会在家里喂杀手。
I don't feed killers in my house.

194
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:43,887
杀手。
Killers.

195
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,481
良好的耶和华说的。
Good Lord.

196
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,297
哦，哦，我明白你的困惑了。
Oh, oh, I see the confusion.

197
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:55,850
天啊，她说的是我们从拉勒米堡附近的夏安族商人那里拿到的那些奖杯。
Boy, she is talking about those trophies that we got off that Cheyenne trader near Fort Laramie.

198
00:32:57,438 --> 00:33:04,306
女士，我知道这是一桩不体面的买卖，但当你在边远地区交易时，这些东西可能很值钱。
Ma'am, I realize that's an unseemly business, but those can be very valuable objects when you're trading in the back country.

199
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:09,976
我们就不能坐下来谈点愉快的事吗。
Now can't we just sit back down and talk about something more pleasant.

200
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:11,660
我们玩得很开心。
We were having such a nice time.

201
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,471
我觉得你最好现在就走。
I think it's best you go now.

202
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:20,176
我们还在等什么?
What the hell are we waiting for?

203
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:22,040
她只有两发子弹。
She's only got two rounds.

204
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,586
如你所愿。
As you wish.

205
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:32,081
把枪留下。
And leave your guns.

206
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:35,308
我们才不会呢。
The hell we will.

207
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:40,851
女士，我相信你知道这些武器有多值钱。
Ma'am, I'm sure you understand how valuable these weapons are.

208
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,631
你可以用你的头皮换些新的。
You can trade your scalps for some new ones.

209
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:53,888
你听到那个女人说的了。
You heard the woman.

210
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:03,767
这些是我爸爸的。
Uh-uh, these were my pa's.

211
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:06,020
他们把他从豌豆岭的尸体上带走了。
They took him off his dead body of Pea Ridge.

212
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:11,428
很好。
Fine.

213
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:22,401
我能拿我的帽子吗?
Can I have my hat?

214
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:25,148
威尔，把帽子给他。
Will, give him his hat.

215
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:21,941
嗨呀!
Hiyah!

216
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:57,352
帮助我。
Help me.

217
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:07,516
推动!推动!
Push! Push!

218
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:46,153
狗娘养的!
Son of a bitch!

219
00:36:46,986 --> 00:36:48,069
啊,下来!
Ah, get down!

220
00:36:56,954 --> 00:36:57,954
等一秒!来看看!
Wait a sec! Come and see!

221
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:03,024
来看看!
Come and see!

222
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:08,025
狗娘养的!
Son of a bitch!

223
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:11,297
Hyah !你到底在干什么?
Hyah! What the hell are you doing?

224
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:12,715
我要活的!
I want 'em alive!

225
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:19,753
哇!她根本不会开枪。
Whoo! She can't shoot for jack shit.

226
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,555
我需要你勇敢一点。好吧?
I need you to be brave. Okay?

227
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:27,556
好吧。
Okay.

228
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,310
重新加载。
Reload.

229
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,420
照顾好你妹妹。
Take care of your sister.

230
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,564
拿上你想要的，走吧。
Just take what you want and go.

231
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:14,495
但我们想要的是你。
But what we want is you.

232
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:29,060
我可以做任何事。
I can do anything.

233
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:32,455
跟踪，射杀水牛，管理团队。
Lay track, shoot buffalo, run the teams.

234
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:36,050
谢谢你的关心，麦卡利斯特先生。
I appreciate the interest, Mr. McAllister.

235
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:37,971
根本没有工作。
There simply isn't the work.

236
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:40,491
我们有足够的人来满足我们的需要。
We have more than enough men to meet our needs.

237
00:41:40,492 --> 00:41:41,871
一定会有办法的。
There has to be something.

238
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:44,060
我甚至可以帮你弄马车。
I could even help with the chuck wagons.

239
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:46,400
哦，上帝，我们不是牛仔。
Oh Lord, we're not cowboys.

240
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,652
我们只是把食物从下游运上来。
We just bring our food up from down the line.

241
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:52,162
美好的一天。最好的运气。
Good day. Best of luck.

242
00:42:17,908 --> 00:42:21,157
你都是对的。没关系。
You're all right. It's okay.

243
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:23,689
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

244
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,776
好吧。好吧。
Okay. Okay.

245
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:33,063
麦卡利斯特太太。
Mrs. McAllister.

246
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,190
隐藏你的妹妹。
Hide your sister.

247
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:09,835
麦卡利斯特太太。这是远远不够。
Mrs. McAllister. That's far enough.

248
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,273
我很遗憾我们一开始就搞砸了。
I regret that we got off on the wrong foot.

249
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:19,495
我希望我们能重新开始，重新来过。
I would like for us to start over, make it right.

250
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:26,935
没什么好谈的，除了你们这些人骑上马走了。
There's nothing to talk about, except you men getting on your horses and riding off.

251
00:43:28,222 --> 00:43:38,485
我尊重你的感受，我也很同情你，但这次对峙对谁都没好处。
I respect how you must be feeling and I can sympathize, but this standoff not doing anybody a lick of good.

252
00:43:42,293 --> 00:43:46,465
的确，我在战争期间和战争后都杀过不少人。
It's true that I've done my share of killing both during the war and after.

253
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:53,426
但有一件事我从没做过，我从没伤害过女人或孩子。
But one thing I ain't never done, I ain't never hurt a woman or a child.

254
00:43:54,982 --> 00:43:57,333
我为什么要相信你说的话。
Why should I believe a word you say.

255
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:04,735
我曾经有过一个女儿。
I had a daughter once.

256
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:10,526
她是我唯一的孩子，我的掌上明珠。
She was my only child, apple of my eye.

257
00:44:16,463 --> 00:44:20,546
我把一个父亲所能给予的每一点爱和感情都慷慨地给予了那个孩子。
Every bit of love and affection a father can give I lavished on that child.

258
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:26,426
现在她死了。
She's dead now.

259
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:30,266
埋在卡梅隆的坟里。
Buried out Cameron way.

260
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:45,533
我对着她的坟墓发誓，我不会伤害你和你孩子的一根头发。
I swear on her grave, I will not harm a hair on your head or on the heads of your children.

261
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,143
该死的!
Dammit!

262
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:03,243
该死的傻瓜!
Damn fools!

263
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:15,594
你没事吧?你没事吧?
You okay? You okay?

264
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:46,059
对不起,妈妈。我不是故意吵醒她的。
I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean to wake her.

265
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,585
没关系。
That's all right.

266
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:48,906
让她在这里。
Bring her here.

267
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:20,991
来吧,贝丝。
Come on, Bess.

268
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,757
他们对黛西做了什么?
What are they doing with Daisy?

269
00:46:37,944 --> 00:46:38,944
不。
No.

270
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,359
不!
No!

271
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:46,157
不。
No.

272
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:15,367
对不起。
Sorry.

273
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:22,855
现在，你抱着他。
Now, you hold him.

274
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:26,069
见鬼，上尉，它会自己好起来的。
Oh, hell, Captain, it'll heal itself.

275
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,005
它会自己痊愈的，舰长。
It'll heal on its own, Captain.

276
00:47:28,006 --> 00:47:30,113
它会自己愈合的。
It'll heal on its own.

277
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:32,659
耶稣，约瑟夫和玛丽，不。
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, no.

278
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,838
请不要亵渎神明。
Please refrain from that papist blasphemy.

279
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,063
打开他的袖子。
Open his sleeve.

280
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:41,762
让他们都见鬼去吧!
Damn them all to hell!

281
00:47:41,763 --> 00:47:51,936
我看今世的一切苦难，若与将来要显在我们身上的荣耀相比，就都不足了。
Well I reckon that all the sufferings of this present age are not worthy compared to the glory, which shall be revealed in us.

282
00:47:56,626 --> 00:47:59,159
会没事的。
It's gonna be all right.

283
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,384
爸爸不可能是雷布，妈妈，就是不可能。
Pa couldn't have been Reb, Ma, just couldn't have been.

284
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:05,035
这就是你生气的原因?
That's what you're upset about?

285
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:10,888
你爸不是叛徒。
Your Pa's no Rebel.

286
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:16,287
他开始为南方而战，但他以爱国者的身份结束了这场战争。
He may have begun fighting for the South, but he ended that war a patriot.

287
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,040
但你说过他-好坏并不总是那么清楚，威尔。
But you said that he was- Good and bad aren't always so clear, Will.

288
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:28,134
有时候你醒来发现自己站在了错误的一边。
Sometimes you wake up and you realize you're on the wrong side of things.

289
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:32,214
当你爸爸找到他的时候，他有勇气纠正错误。
And when you pa did, he have the courage to make things right.

290
00:48:32,215 --> 00:48:33,598
就像他一直做的那样。
Just like he always does.

291
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:46,708
等他回来，外面的杀手会感受到上帝的愤怒。
And when he comes back, those killers outside are gonna feel God's wrath.

292
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:51,958
如果他们杀了他呢?
What if they kill him instead?

293
00:49:19,226 --> 00:49:20,309
快吃吧，孩子。
Better eat up, son.

294
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:24,748
饿着肚子是很难勇敢的。
Hard to be brave on an empty belly.

295
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:33,208
队长,还有,
Well, Captain, there's,

296
00:49:35,816 --> 00:49:40,108
关于这一切，有些事我不太明白。
there's just something about all this that I don't rightly understand.

297
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:44,496
继续。
Go on.

298
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:49,288
你只说了不要伤害女人和孩子。
Well, it's all you said about not hurting women or kids.

299
00:49:54,146 --> 00:49:56,246
你认为我们应该坚持这一点。
And you think we ought to stand by that.

300
00:50:04,706 --> 00:50:10,945
你还记得你爸爸和我骑马去保卫我们的生活方式不受暴君林肯的迫害。
You remember when your Pappy and I rode out to defend our way of life from the tyrant Lincoln.

301
00:50:10,946 --> 00:50:11,946
我做的事。
I do.

302
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:23,429
我们当时有很多关于骑士精神和荣誉以及战争应该是什么样子的好想法。
We had a lot of fine ideas then about chivalry and honor and what war should look like.

303
00:50:25,346 --> 00:50:29,579
我们正义的事业如何带领我们走向胜利。
How the rightness of our cause would carry us to victory.

304
00:50:35,486 --> 00:50:38,879
北方佬偷了我们的牛。
And the Yankees stole our cattle.

305
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:46,229
他们无故烧毁我们的农场，吊死我们的亲人。
They burned our farms and hung our kin without cause.

306
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:56,566
我们所有美好的想法，在他们贪婪、凶残的仇恨面前，都算不了什么。
And all our fine notions were nothing in the face of their rapacious, murderous hatred.

307
00:51:06,116 --> 00:51:07,919
他们夺走了我唯一的孩子，
They took my only child from me,

308
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:14,046
剥夺了她的生命
ripped her from this life

309
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:18,479
毫无怜悯或怜悯之心。
without mercy or pity.

310
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:30,547
世上没有法律，天堂也没有，地狱也没有
And there ain't no law on earth or in heaven or hell

311
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:37,800
这能阻止一个父亲复仇。
that can keep a father from taking his revenge.

312
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:42,366
不是魔鬼
Not the devil

313
00:51:48,447 --> 00:51:49,860
而不是上帝本人。
and not God himself.

314
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,666
这让事情更清楚了吗?
That make things any clearer?

315
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:12,797
反正我们也不会伤害任何人。
Hell, we ain't gonna have to hurt anybody anyway.

316
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,060
你怎么知道的?
How you figure that?

317
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:24,090
麦卡利斯特太太不适合这种生活。
Mrs. McAllister ain't cut out for this kinda life.

318
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:28,109
我看她的眼睛就知道了。
I can tell that by looking in her eyes.

319
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:34,590
我们给她足够的时间，她就会出来找我们。
We give her enough time, she's just gonna come on out here to us.

320
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:39,660
这是明智的做法。
That's the sensible thing to do.

321
00:52:41,217 --> 00:52:43,660
她是个通情达理的女人。
And she is a sensible woman.

322
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,150
船长!什么?
Captain! What?

323
00:52:48,177 --> 00:52:49,177
地狱。
The hell.

324
00:52:50,643 --> 00:52:52,476
诅咒!
Damnation!

325
00:53:16,762 --> 00:53:18,212
他们在几英里外都能看到。
They'll see that for miles.

326
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,756
马!
Ma!

327
00:53:26,757 --> 00:53:28,309
保持燃烧，明白吗?
Keep it burning, you understand?

328
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,829
任何你能找到的东西。
Anything you can find.

329
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:27,259
看。
Look.

330
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:10,271
Will，你的妹妹。
Will, your sister.

331
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:52,485
快来帮忙。
Come to a help.

332
00:55:53,638 --> 00:55:56,138
孩子们还在里面吗?
The children are still inside?

333
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,839
你一个人来吗，邻居?
You come alone, neighbor?

334
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:04,677
是的，我看到了烟，我骑得很快。
Yeah, I see the smoke, I come riding real fast.

335
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:06,001
为什么?什么是错的。
Why? What's wrong.

336
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:10,299
萨姆森先生，不，去找人帮忙。
Mr. Sameson, no, go get help.

337
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:14,634
寻求帮助!
Get help!

338
00:56:14,635 --> 00:56:16,348
不。我要活捉他。
No. I want him alive.

339
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:18,952
骑吧，萨姆森先生，骑吧!
Ride, Mr. Sameson, ride!

340
00:57:06,363 --> 00:57:07,197
让它燃烧吧!
Let it burn!

341
00:57:07,198 --> 00:57:09,652
你疯了吗?队长要活捉他们。
Are you crazy? Captain wants them alive.

342
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:24,260
我只是想帮忙。
Just trying to help.

343
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:44,790
让他走。
Let him go.

344
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,229
麦卡利斯特太太，我很惊讶。
Mrs. McAllister, I'm surprised.

345
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,713
一个女人大声嚷嚷并继续这样做是有失尊严的。
It does not dignify a woman to holler and carry on such.

346
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,590
他没有对你做任何事。
He hasn't done anything to you.

347
00:58:58,229 --> 00:58:59,729
这是完全正确的。
Well, that is entirely true.

348
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:06,933
但正如你所见，你的固执让我们都陷入了困境。
But as you see, your obstinance has put us all in a difficult situation.

349
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:15,573
所以我再次请求你们到这里来，让我们像文明的人一样解决这个问题。
So I'm gonna ask you again to come out here and let us resolve this like civilized people.

350
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,552
海蒂，你待在那儿。
Hattie, you stay there.

351
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:21,329
他不善于说谎。
He's a no good liar.

352
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,330
他不可信。
He can't be trusted.

353
00:59:23,932 --> 00:59:26,083
当然，你宁愿不文明。
Of course, you'd rather not be civilized.

354
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,113
我将不得不求助于其他方法。
I'll have to resort to other methods.

355
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,340
你不必这么做的。
You don't have to do this.

356
00:59:35,341 --> 00:59:39,333
我希望不会。我是牧师的儿子。
I'd hope not to. See, I'm a preacher's son.

357
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,839
我从小就被教导要相信《圣经》。
I was raised to believe in the Good Book.

358
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,904
这是唯一能让我们不变成野蛮人的东西。
It's the only thing that keeps us from being savages.

359
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:50,279
但即使是牧师的孩子也有他的极限。
But even a preacher's boy has got his limits.

360
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,434
请。他有一个妻子和五个孩子。
Please. He has a wife and five children.

361
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:57,299
耶和华是我的牧者。
The Lord is my shepherd.

362
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,300
我不需要。
I shall not want.

363
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:00,419
你让我躺下。
You made me to lay down.

364
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,310
我不喜欢重复自己的话。
I don't like repeating myself.

365
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:03,144
他领我在可安歇的水边。
He led me besides the still waters.

366
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:08,283
麦卡利斯特夫人，我再说一遍。
Mrs. McAllister, so I'm gonna say this one more time.

367
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:10,281
快点出来!
Come on out!

368
01:00:10,282 --> 01:00:15,249
在死荫的幽谷中，我无所畏惧。
In the valley of the shadow off death, I will fear no evil.

369
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,277
不。不。
No. No.

370
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:18,069
因为你与我同在。
For thou art with me.

371
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,795
你把它放在街对面了。
You left it across the street.

372
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:28,001
看到了吗?
See?

373
01:02:30,242 --> 01:02:33,421
也许我最好下来护送你过去。
Maybe I best come down and escort you across.

374
01:02:33,422 --> 01:02:35,398
不，小姐，我很好。
No, miss, I'm quite all right.

375
01:02:41,882 --> 01:02:45,004
嘿。你真打算半醉半醉开车回家吗?
Hey. You really gonna drive home half liquored up?

376
01:02:46,352 --> 01:02:50,855
在我看来，你应该清醒过来，或者继续喝下去，喝个烂醉。
Seems to me you ought to sober up or just go on, get drunk all the way.

377
01:02:53,496 --> 01:02:54,818
我得回我的农场了。
I gotta get home to my farm.

378
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:58,025
农场吗?你的农场不会想念你的。
Farm? Your farm ain't gonna miss you.

379
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:01,231
我们的床很不错。
We got real nice beds in there.

380
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:03,991
软缎子床单。
Soft satin sheets.

381
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,581
哦，你可以睡一整晚。
Oh, you could sleep all night.

382
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:07,332
早上第一件事就是起床。
Wake up first thing in the morning.

383
01:03:08,522 --> 01:03:10,472
当然，你也可以做其他事情。
Of course, you can do other things too.

384
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:13,105
我的妻子。
My wife.

385
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:14,545
你的妻子吗?她在等我。
Your wife? She's waiting on me.

386
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:20,646
直觉告诉我，你妻子并不欣赏你，
Something tells me your wife, she don't appreciate you,

387
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:28,042
像你这样努力工作的人，不是你应得的。
hard workin' man like you, not the way you deserve.

388
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,226
哦,天啊!
Oh, geez!

389
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:53,151
Hyah !
Hyah!

390
01:03:58,144 --> 01:04:00,925
我觉得你该学学怎么煮咖啡了。
I think it's time you learned how to make some coffee.

391
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:03,502
首先，放一些水。
First, put on some water.

392
01:04:27,752 --> 01:04:29,675
现在我们需要磨碎一些豆子。
Now we need to grind up some beans.

393
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:33,036
你希望他们像食盐一样好。
You want 'em fine like table salt.

394
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:38,813
我们可以煮吗?
Can we boil 'em?

395
01:04:39,693 --> 01:04:44,252
这可能就是牛手制作出他们称之为咖啡的黑色污泥的方法，但这不是正确的方法。
That may be how cow hands make some black sludge they call coffee, but it's not the proper way.

396
01:04:44,253 --> 01:04:45,902
我们做了什么不同的事?
Well, what do we do different?

397
01:04:45,903 --> 01:04:47,252
那个苦差事怎么样?
How's that grind looking?

398
01:04:54,513 --> 01:04:56,042
就像盐一样。
Just like salt.

399
01:04:56,043 --> 01:04:57,212
好。
Good.

400
01:04:57,213 --> 01:04:59,313
现在找点东西做过滤器。
Now find something we can use as a filter.

401
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:30,273
现在我们等它沸腾。
Now we wait for it to boil.

402
01:05:32,374 --> 01:05:34,223
你想知道我和你爸是怎么认识的吗?
You wanna know how your pa and I met?

403
01:05:38,193 --> 01:05:41,044
有一天，我在圣路易斯放学回家的路上。
I was walking home from school one day back in St. Louis.

404
01:05:42,243 --> 01:05:46,082
那是在战争期间，街上到处都是士兵。
It was during the war and the streets were full of soldiers.

405
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:48,123
有一群人决定找点乐子。
One bunch decided they wanted to have some fun.

406
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:51,932
所以他们偷了我的书。
So they stole my books.

407
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:54,062
我恳求他们把它们还给我。
I begged and pleaded for them to give 'em back.

408
01:05:54,063 --> 01:05:55,063
但是他们不会。
But they wouldn't.

409
01:05:56,912 --> 01:06:01,176
就在我开始哭的时候，我听到有人命令那些男孩停下来。
And just when I started to cry, I heard someone order those boys to stop.

410
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:06,787
我本以为会是中尉或上尉，结果只有你爸。
I turned around expecting a lieutenant or a captain, but it was just your pa.

411
01:06:08,824 --> 01:06:13,386
他孤身一人，穿着士兵的制服。
He was all alone, in a private's uniform no less.

412
01:06:15,424 --> 01:06:26,257
这是一个人对六个人，但他的声音里有某种东西，某种东西表明他仍然可以把他们每一个人都舔一遍，一次一个，或者一起舔一遍。
There was one man against six, but there was something in his voice, something that said he could still lick every single one of them, one at a time or all together.

413
01:06:28,174 --> 01:06:34,777
他们听到后，一个接一个地走开了，直到最后一个，把书还给我，向我道歉。
When they heard it, one by one, they started to drift away till the last one, gave me back my books and apologized.

414
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:42,003
你爸问我能不能送我回家。
Your pa asked me if he could walk me home.

415
01:06:42,004 --> 01:06:45,397
我说，是的，但我心里已经知道了。
I said, yes, but in my heart, I already knew.

416
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:49,000
知道什么?
Knew what?

417
01:06:53,372 --> 01:06:56,705
他就是我想嫁的人。
That he was the man I wanted to marry.

418
01:06:57,584 --> 01:07:04,507
这个世界上没有什么能让他放弃，无论发生什么，他都会站起来保护我。
That nothing in this world could ever cause him to give up and whatever would come, he would stand up and protect me.

419
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:14,617
好了，现在把它倒在豆子上，慢慢地。
All right, now pour it over the beans, nice and slow.

420
01:07:35,674 --> 01:07:37,533
再来点冰糖怎么样?
How about some more rock candy?

421
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:39,484
黑咖啡是骗不了你的，对吧?
Can't trick your coffee black, can you?

422
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:01,444
Will. Will!

423
01:08:03,964 --> 01:08:05,214
我需要你去放哨。
I need you to keep watch.

424
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:13,504
我马上回来。
I'll be right back.

425
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:24,848
嘘,嘘!
Psst, psst!

426
01:08:28,175 --> 01:08:29,175
马!
Ma!

427
01:08:32,584 --> 01:08:33,585
不要开枪。
Don't shoot.

428
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:36,278
我只是来谈话的。
I just come the talk.

429
01:08:38,675 --> 01:08:42,538
你要是敢退缩我发誓，我就一枪崩了你。
You so much as flinch and I swear, I'll put a bullet through your heart.

430
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:44,475
我不是武装。
I ain't armed.

431
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:48,334
直穿你的心脏。
Right through your heart.

432
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:49,334
请。
Please.

433
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:54,107
其他人不知道我来了。
The others don't know I come.

434
01:08:54,108 --> 01:08:55,158
你能听我说吗?
Will you just listen?

435
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:59,024
好吧。然后说话。
All right. Talk then.

436
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:03,664
这可不是我想要加入的。
This ain't what I thought I was joining.

437
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:08,318
我们应该抢银行和火车，而不是伤害妇女和儿童。
We was supposed to rob banks and trains, not hurt women and children.

438
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:12,835
我再也无法接受了。
It just don't sit right with me no more.

439
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:16,384
你支持我杀我邻居的原因。
You stood by why I killed my neighbor.

440
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:20,375
如果我说了什么，我也会死在地上。
If I'd done said anything, I'd be lying dead on the ground too.

441
01:09:23,135 --> 01:09:27,128
我记得我妈妈曾经警告我不要结交坏朋友。
I remember my mama once warned me about falling in with bad company.

442
01:09:28,715 --> 01:09:32,708
当我这么做的时候，我没有意识到分手是多么的难。
Once I did, I didn't realize how hard it would be to part ways.

443
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:36,008
他们是谁?
Who are they?

444
01:09:37,476 --> 01:09:39,026
他们是密苏里来的一个帮派。
They're a gang from Missouri.

445
01:09:40,025 --> 01:09:42,905
他们在战争中与匡特里尔的突袭者并肩作战。
They rode with Quantrill's Raiders during the war.

446
01:09:42,906 --> 01:09:44,739
船长是他的得力助手。
Captain was his right hand man.

447
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:51,605
当老匡特里尔被杀或投降后，大多数人都放弃了。
Most of the fellers gave up when old Quantrill was killed or after the surrender.

448
01:09:51,606 --> 01:09:52,749
但不是队长。
But not Captain.

449
01:09:53,646 --> 01:09:55,358
战争对他来说永远不会结束。
The war ain't never ended for him.

450
01:10:00,276 --> 01:10:06,898
听着，如果如果我帮你，你能帮我和美国法警过个好日子吗?
Look, if if'n I help you, will you put in a good world with the US Marshall for me?

451
01:10:09,756 --> 01:10:11,859
好吧，这是我的计划。
Right then, here's my plan.

452
01:10:12,696 --> 01:10:16,294
其他人都在睡觉，我应该在值班。
The others are sleeping and I'm supposed to be on watch.

453
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:21,605
如果你和孩子们能从窗户出去，我在大约一百步远的地方和你们会合。
If you and the young ones can get out of the window, I'll meet you back about a hundred paces.

454
01:10:21,606 --> 01:10:22,605
我把马。
I'll bring horses.

455
01:10:24,335 --> 01:10:25,804
你可以在不吵醒他们的情况下找到他们。
You can get 'em without waking them.

456
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,806
我已经给他们准备好了。
I already done got 'em all saddled up.

457
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:36,666
我去让孩子们准备好。
I'll get the children ready.

458
01:10:37,862 --> 01:10:39,299
我们10分钟后见。
We'll meet you in 10 minutes.

459
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:43,634
好吧。
All right.

460
01:10:43,635 --> 01:10:44,523
谢谢你！
Thank you.

461
01:10:44,524 --> 01:10:50,199
我们可以在大家变聪明之前离开然后去找杰布。
And we can ride on out afore anyone's wiser and then go find Jeb.

462
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,378
杰德!狗娘养的!
Jed! Son of a bitch!

463
01:11:01,356 --> 01:11:02,799
她抓住他了，上尉。
She got him, Captain.

464
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:06,609
现在我得告诉他妈妈!
Now I gotta tell his mama!

465
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:10,715
那个傻逼孩子根本不会撒谎!
That dang fool kid couldn't lie for shit!

466
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:12,095
管好你的嘴。
You mind your tongue.

467
01:11:12,096 --> 01:11:14,409
妈，他只是想帮忙!
Ma, he was just trying to help!

468
01:11:19,746 --> 01:11:22,209
我从没告诉过他你爸的名字，一次都没有。
I never told him your pa's name, not one time.

469
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:24,896
那他们是怎么知道的?
Then how did they know it?

470
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:27,606
他们不是冲着我们来的。
They're not after us.

471
01:11:27,607 --> 01:11:29,106
他们来找你爸爸。
They came looking for your pa.

472
01:11:32,646 --> 01:11:35,255
所以他们才在外面慢慢来。
That's why they're out there taking their time.

473
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:37,505
所以他们现在才在外面等着。
That's why they're out there now waiting.

474
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,506
我们只是诱饵。
We're just the bait.

475
01:11:39,876 --> 01:11:41,549
你父亲正步入陷阱。
Your father's walking into a trap.

476
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:46,998
威尔，我需要你做点事。
Will, I'm gonna need you to do something.

477
01:11:46,999 --> 01:11:48,839
你要有勇气去做。
And you're gonna have to be brave to do it.

478
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,316
我需要你去找小牝马。
I need you to get the filly.

479
01:11:54,817 --> 01:11:57,928
什么?不,我不能。
What? No, I can't.

480
01:11:57,929 --> 01:11:59,482
是的,你可以。
Yes, you can.

481
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:01,179
你是你父亲的儿子。
You're your father's son.

482
01:12:03,187 --> 01:12:05,149
该我们来保护他了。
It's our turn to protect him.

483
01:13:10,977 --> 01:13:15,977
那个美国佬小杂种!
That little Yankee bastard!

484
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:47,951
他们带走了那个北方佬混蛋他们一枪爆了他的头把他烧了如果妈妈看到他死了
They took that Yankee bastard They shot him in the head They put him on the fire So if mama saw he's dead

485
01:13:53,893 --> 01:13:54,894
Sh !
Sh!

486
01:13:59,297 --> 01:14:01,047
没关系。没关系。
It's okay. It's okay.

487
01:14:06,365 --> 01:14:12,590
北方佬去了巴尔的摩他们遇到了一匹母马
The Yankee's went to Baltimore And they came upon a mare

488
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:56,632
见鬼，上尉，马要奔向天国了!
Hell, Captain, the horses are running to kingdom come!

489
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:59,257
你得到她!
You get her!

490
01:15:00,848 --> 01:15:01,848
哦,来吧。
Oh, come on.

491
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:12,804
狗娘养的!回到这里。
Son of a bitch! Get back here.

492
01:15:15,358 --> 01:15:17,831
Will! Will!

493
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:20,198
认为你会。
Think you're going.

494
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:28,391
你知道吗，警监，他之前并没有伤害你的意思，但他现在有了。
You know, Captain, he didn't mean you no harm before, but he does now.

495
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,030
放松。
Easy.

496
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,536
不!不!
No! No!

497
01:15:46,537 --> 01:15:50,543

498
01:15:50,544 --> 01:15:53,838
你不要动。你理解我吗?
You don't move. You understand me?

499
01:15:53,839 --> 01:15:55,089
别动!
Don't you move!

500
01:15:56,509 --> 01:15:59,425
天啊，天啊，她打到我的脸了!

507
01:18:03,963 --> 01:18:04,796
你跑，带她走。
You run, just take her.

508
01:18:04,797 --> 01:18:07,323
去丹尼尔森吧。走吧!

509
01:18:07,324 --> 01:18:08,822

510
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,635
过来,你!

511
01:18:16,195 --> 01:18:20,537
过来，我抓住你了!
Come here, I got you!

512
01:18:20,538 --> 01:18:25,539
快离开那里!放开!
Get out of there! Let go!

513
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,332
你要去哪?
Where'd you go?

514
01:18:30,463 --> 01:18:32,669
出来吧，我不会伤害你的。
Come on out, I won't hurt ya.

515
01:18:39,232 --> 01:18:40,232
母狗!
Bitch!

516
01:19:00,823 --> 01:19:03,343
你刚才做了件蠢事。
That was a damn fool thing you done back there.

517
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,132
差点害死自己。
Almost got yourself killed.

518
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:11,109
我告诉过你，我从没伤害过女人。
I told you, I ain't never harmed a woman.

519
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:13,149
队长，我们什么时候去抓那个美国佬混蛋?
Captain, when we gonna go get that little Yankee bastard?

520
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,008
闭上你的嘴。
Shut your mouth.

521
01:19:15,009 --> 01:19:16,860
这里有我们需要的一切。
We got everything we need right here.

522
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,994
我们要做的就是在麦卡利斯特夫人死在这里之前把她送回家。
All we gotta do is get Mrs. McAllister back home before she catches her death out here.

523
01:19:22,995 --> 01:19:28,070
是啊，但你告诉我我能把他带回来，割开他的-闭上你的臭嘴!
Yeah, but you told me I could get him and bring him back here and cut his- Shut your belly achin' rotten mouth!

524
01:19:46,547 --> 01:19:50,211
你动一下，你就会死。
You move, you die.

525
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:08,140
你想看看肉被烧掉是什么感觉吗?
You want to see how it feels to get your flesh burned off?

526
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:09,464
温柔点，孩子们。
Gentle does it, boys.

527
01:20:16,901 --> 01:20:19,390
就像《传道书》里说的:
As it says in Ecclesiastes:

528
01:20:19,391 --> 01:20:23,953
把你的面包撒在水面上，因为你会在许多天后找到它。
Cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days.

529
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:45,591
杰布!
Jeb!

530
01:20:47,954 --> 01:20:48,953
想死吗?
Care to die?

531
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:58,010
这可不是搭讪的好方法。
This ain't no way to start a conversation.

532
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,824
让她走，米勒。
Let her go, Miller.

533
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:03,914
你叫我米勒上尉。
It's Captain Miller to you.

534
01:21:05,321 --> 01:21:07,370
如果你能记住，我会很感激的。
I'd appreciate it if you'd remember that.

535
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:14,561
我的孩子们在哪里?
Where are my children?

536
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:17,380
他们是安全的。
They're safe.

537
01:21:17,381 --> 01:21:18,881
他们成功地渡过了河。
They made it across the river.

538
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:24,791
你还称自己是邦联军官。
You still call yourself a Confederate officer.

539
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:28,001
你没有权利囚禁一个女人。
You got no right to hold a woman prisoner.

540
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:32,650
"人要离开父母"
"For a man shall leave his father and mother"

541
01:21:32,651 --> 01:21:34,120
并且忠于他的妻子。
and cleave unto his wife.

542
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:36,220
"他们将成为一体"
"And they shall be as one flesh."

543
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:39,130
《创世纪》第二章，24节。
Genesis chapter two, 24th verse.

544
01:21:39,131 --> 01:21:44,684
你的罪孽已经被发现了，杰贝迪亚·麦卡利斯特，现在他们要惩罚你全家。
Your sins have found you out, Jebediah McAllister, and now they are visited upon your whole family.

545
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:57,711
你想要什么?
What do you want?

546
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,481
复仇。
Vengeance.

547
01:22:01,482 --> 01:22:03,730
复仇属于上帝，米勒。
Vengeance belongs to the Lord, Miller.

548
01:22:03,731 --> 01:22:05,924
上帝的时间太长了。
Well, the Lord takes too damn long.

549
01:22:08,411 --> 01:22:11,321
现在我知道我说得不够清楚了。
Now I can see that I am being less than clear.

550
01:22:11,322 --> 01:22:12,584
所以我直说了吧。
So let me be blunt.

551
01:22:15,161 --> 01:22:20,655
你要么把枪放下要么就把你漂亮老婆的眼睛挖出来。
You either put that gun down or your pretty little wife is gonna have her eyes cut out of her head.

552
01:22:22,091 --> 01:22:23,894
你说过你从没伤害过女人。
You said you never hurt a woman.

553
01:22:26,531 --> 01:22:28,515
我没有，但他有。
I haven't, but he has.

554
01:22:33,341 --> 01:22:41,710
我女儿已经在坟墓里躺了12年，而杀害她的凶手却逍遥法外。
My daughter has laid in her grave for 12 years, while her murderers have walked free.

555
01:22:41,711 --> 01:22:43,840
我们没有谋杀任何人。
We didn't murder anyone.

556
01:22:43,841 --> 01:22:44,772
这是个意外。
It was an accident.

557
01:22:44,773 --> 01:22:45,915
她信任你。
She trusted you.

558
01:22:47,622 --> 01:22:50,470
她信任你，因为你是她的同胞。
She trusted you because you were her countryman.

559
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:54,195
没有一个人知道她在里面。问他!
Not one man there knew she was inside. Ask him!

560
01:22:55,289 --> 01:22:59,474
除了你，没有一个人活着。
Not one man there draws breath, except you.

561
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,065
我们还以为是你呢。
We thought it was you in there.

562
01:23:05,442 --> 01:23:09,014
不，只有我的心。
No, only my heart.

563
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:20,411
让它慢。
Make it slow.

564
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,835
杰布!
Jeb!

565
01:23:25,092 --> 01:23:28,751
你发誓，你不会伤害她。你会让她走的。
You swear, you won't hurt her. You'll let her go.

566
01:23:28,752 --> 01:23:30,791
不,不,杰布!
No, no, Jeb!

567
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:32,295
在我孩子的坟墓上。
On my child's grave.

568
01:23:34,362 --> 01:23:35,462
你不能相信他。
You can't trust him.

569
01:23:42,463 --> 01:23:43,463
不。
No.

570
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:46,670
不，不，不!
No, no, no, no!

571
01:23:55,596 --> 01:23:56,596
不,不!
No, no!

572
01:23:58,179 --> 01:24:01,896
现在再也没有小杂种了!
Ain't having no more little bastards now!

573
01:24:06,695 --> 01:24:09,097
希望你不介意，杰别迪亚。
Hope you don't mind, Jebediah.

574
01:24:09,098 --> 01:24:10,824
这是我的荣幸。
The pleasure's all mine.

575
01:24:10,825 --> 01:24:12,273
你这个狗娘养的!
You son of a bitch!

576
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:17,985
来吧,公主!
Come on, princess!

577
01:24:33,912 --> 01:24:37,736
他的女儿?你为什么不告诉我。
His daughter? Why did you never tell me.

578
01:24:40,203 --> 01:24:46,512
如果我必须为南部联盟杀人，那就够糟糕的了，我为联邦杀了一个孩子。
Bad enough if I had to kill men for the Confederacy, I murdered a child for the union.

579
01:24:46,513 --> 01:24:48,313
这不是谋杀。你不知道。
It wasn't murder. You didn't know.

580
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,535
这对他来说无关紧要。
It doesn't matter to him.

581
01:24:54,673 --> 01:25:00,098
等他完成了他要做的事，你就离开这里，不要回头。
When he finishes what he is gonna do, you ride outta here and don't look back.

582
01:25:00,099 --> 01:25:02,681
我不会走的，现在不会，以后也不会。
I'm not leaving, now or ever.

583
01:26:03,894 --> 01:26:08,746
好。麦卡利斯特太太，骄者必败。
Well. Mrs. McAllister, pride goeth before a fall.

584
01:26:15,224 --> 01:26:25,996
现在，我认为你应该坐在庭审的前排因为你和被告关系密切。
Now, I think that you deserve to have a front row seat for this trial because of your close relationship with the accused.

585
01:26:30,314 --> 01:26:42,857
杰贝迪亚·麦卡利斯特，你被指控亵渎上帝和美利坚联盟国，包括谋杀一名儿童。
Jebediah McAllister, you are here by charged with crimes against God and the Confederate States of America, including a murder of a child.

586
01:26:47,023 --> 01:26:48,047
你要怎么辩护?
How do you plead?

587
01:26:50,204 --> 01:26:51,754
我已经做了我该做的。
I have done what I have done.

588
01:26:53,353 --> 01:26:54,953
你已经听到他的供词了。
You have heard the confession.

589
01:26:57,014 --> 01:26:58,014
别打我老婆!
Don't hit my wife!

590
01:27:00,074 --> 01:27:02,603
陪审团的先生们-哇!
Gentlemen of the jury- Wahoo!

591
01:27:02,604 --> 01:27:04,513
你认为被告如何?
How do you find the defendant?

592
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:11,083
真是罪大恶极，上尉。
Guilty as hell, Captain.

593
01:27:11,084 --> 01:27:12,106
有罪的是地狱。
Guilty as hell.

594
01:27:17,594 --> 01:27:19,232
你没有权利。
You got no right.

595
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:25,037
看看你做了什么，麦卡利斯特。
Look what you have wrought, McAllister.

596
01:27:27,464 --> 01:27:29,514
你有什么要说的吗?
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

597
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:34,393
你根本不在乎我要说什么。
You don't give a damn what I have to say.

598
01:27:34,394 --> 01:27:36,106
继续，做你该做的。
Go on, do what you gotta do.

599
01:27:36,107 --> 01:27:37,274
不!
No!

600
01:27:39,334 --> 01:27:41,461
你熟悉罗马书吗?
Are you familiar with the book of Romans?

601
01:27:45,171 --> 01:27:49,721
因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。
"For all, have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."

602
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:54,607
我相信上帝会原谅你的-不!
And I have no doubt that God will forgive you- No!

603
01:27:54,608 --> 01:27:56,094
通过他儿子的血。
Through the blood of his Son.

604
01:28:00,494 --> 01:28:02,202
但我不是上帝。
But I ain't God.

605
01:28:05,879 --> 01:28:07,461
我会做任何事!
I'll do anything!

606
01:28:08,654 --> 01:28:10,654
我说了，我愿意做任何事!
I said, I'd do anything!

607
01:28:12,824 --> 01:28:13,824
任何事?
Anything?

608
01:28:18,014 --> 01:28:19,097
每个人都在这里。
Each man here.

609
01:28:22,034 --> 01:28:23,808
完全是你自己的自由意志。
Entirely of your own free will.

610
01:28:27,731 --> 01:28:28,731
海蒂,不。
Hattie, no.

611
01:28:30,314 --> 01:28:32,178
好。不是因为我。
Well. Not for me.

612
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,327
海蒂,不!你说呢?
Hattie, no! What do you say?

613
01:28:36,884 --> 01:28:38,467
海蒂,不。
Hattie, no.

614
01:28:39,537 --> 01:28:41,288
不要这样做!Woo-ie !
Don't do it! Woo-ie!

615
01:28:44,148 --> 01:28:45,730
海蒂,不。
Hattie, no.

616
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,388
不要，不要!
Don't do it, no!

617
01:28:49,749 --> 01:28:50,749
海蒂!
Hattie!

618
01:29:01,338 --> 01:29:05,787
我希望你在那里表现得像个南方绅士。
Now I expect you to conduct yourself like a Southern gentleman in there.

619
01:29:10,755 --> 01:29:15,535
我要让你看着你的妻子，把自己变成一个妓女
I am going to allow you to watch your wife, make herself into a whore

620
01:29:18,015 --> 01:29:20,065
然后我还是会杀了你
and then I'm gonna kill ya just the same.

621
01:29:40,595 --> 01:29:44,762
取下你的枪带，放在门口。
Take off your gun belt and leave it by the door.

622
01:29:46,485 --> 01:29:48,385
如果你喜欢，我可以给你喷点香水。
I can put some perfume on if you like.

623
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:53,688
我去年刚从纽约买了一瓶。
I got a bottle in just last year from New York.

624
01:30:29,452 --> 01:30:36,093
"瞧，骑在他身上的那个苍白的骑士，他的名字叫死神。"
"And behold, the pale rider which sat on him, his name was Death."

625
01:30:48,094 --> 01:30:49,859
“地狱跟在他后面。”
"And Hell followed with him."

626
01:32:37,342 --> 01:32:42,341
去死吧，你个狗娘养的。
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

627
01:32:54,345 --> 01:32:56,678
嘿，快点进去。
Hey, hurry it up in there.

628
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:01,841
我的老二开始烦躁了。
My pecker's getting antsy.

629
01:33:08,884 --> 01:33:13,885
这狗娘养的又朝我开枪了!
Son of a bitch shot me again!

630
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:20,026
他们全都杀了!
Kill 'em all!

631
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:55,199
我一切都好。好吧。
I'm all right. All right.

632
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:13,383
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

633
01:34:25,173 --> 01:34:26,576
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

634
01:34:38,179 --> 01:34:39,679
继续。
Go on.

635
01:35:19,021 --> 01:35:20,439
谢谢你,弗兰克。
Thank you, Frank.

636
01:35:23,287 --> 01:35:28,281
你为她报仇，就像她是你的一样。
You avenged her as if she was yours.

637
01:35:31,878 --> 01:35:36,190
愿他所有的荣耀都展现在你身上，我的兄弟。
May all his glory be revealed you, my brother.

638
01:36:00,138 --> 01:36:04,431
他必向恶人设下网罗。
And upon the wicked, he shall rain snares.

639
01:36:07,098 --> 01:36:08,098
火!
Fire!

640
01:36:10,488 --> 01:36:11,904
和硫磺!
And brimstone!

641
01:36:12,739 --> 01:36:14,278
还有可怕的暴风雨
And a horrible tempest

642
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:19,538
必作他们杯中的分。
shall be the portion of their cup.

643
01:36:29,509 --> 01:36:31,462
这不是结束，麦卡利斯特。
This is not the end, McAllister.

644
01:36:37,368 --> 01:36:38,369
听到了吗?
You hear me?

645
01:36:39,289 --> 01:36:40,702
这仅仅是个开始。
This is just the beginning.

646
01:36:41,988 --> 01:36:46,341
父亲的不公平将殃及孩子们!
The inequities of the father will visited upon the children!

647
01:36:52,488 --> 01:36:55,489
我一定会抓到你的女儿和儿子!
I am gonna hunt down your girl and boy!

648
01:36:57,001 --> 01:37:01,333
我不在乎多少年，我不在乎多少英里!
I don't care how years, I don't care how many miles!

649
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,338
我会找到他们的!
I will find them!

650
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:07,112
杰布。
Jeb.

651
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:21,973
你这个狗娘养的!
You son of a bitch!

652
01:38:04,022 --> 01:38:05,023
嘿!
Hey!

653
01:38:09,156 --> 01:38:10,156
Jebediah。
Jebediah.

654
01:38:23,405 --> 01:38:24,404
结束了!
It is finished!

655
01:40:43,994 --> 01:40:57,829
我会陪你走到最后，我会陪你走，我的爱
Until the end I'll walk with you I'll walk with you, my love

656
01:41:00,216 --> 01:41:11,649
我将用我的心说出真相只有那时，对你
And with my heart I'll speak the truth And only then, to you

657
01:41:48,529 --> 01:41:58,967
荣耀属于我们所有的爱，它像一条奔流不息的大河
Glory be to all our love That flows a mighty river

658
01:42:01,089 --> 01:42:06,089
光荣归于开阔的平原
And glory to the open plains

659
01:42:08,611 --> 01:42:12,361
它与众不同
That hold it like no other
