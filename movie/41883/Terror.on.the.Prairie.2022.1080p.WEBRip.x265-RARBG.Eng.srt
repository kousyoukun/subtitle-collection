1
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,492
And god saw that the wickedness

2
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:43,021
of man was great in the earth.

3
00:02:43,022 --> 00:02:44,521
And that every imagination

4
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:48,455
of the thoughts in his heart was only evil continually.

5
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,962
And it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth

6
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,072
and it grieved his heart.

7
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,968
And the lord said, "I will destroy a man

8
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,132
that I have created on the face of the earth.

9
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:14,638
For it repenteth me that I have made them."

10
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:18,534
Book of Genesis 6:5-7.

11
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
That's enough.

12
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,054
I said, that's enough.

13
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,182
I apologize, Gideon.

14
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,129
If manners maketh man, I have surrounded myself with boys.

15
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:19,572
You look like you could use a drink.

16
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:32,801
Hey.

17
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:37,173
Do you know who I am?

18
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:38,174
Uh-huh.

19
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,779
Then you know why I'm here.

20
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:54,390
Your tears, they do you credit.

21
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,849
They show contrition.

22
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:01,866
And I have no doubt that god will forgive you

23
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,986
through the blood of his son.

24
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,599
But I ain't god.

25
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,933
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

26
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,646
Ooh!

27
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,725
Pick him up!

28
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,194
Hell, son. Live in it.

29
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:21,240
It's coming, sweet girl. It's coming.

30
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,911
Sh.

31
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:07,270
Rise and shine

32
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:48,206
Coffee.

33
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,556
Yep, yep, yep.

34
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:02,174
Ready?

35
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:00,132
What's going on. What wrong?

36
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,633
Hm, want your bed?

37
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:03,645
Be calm. Okay?

38
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:30,414
Sh, sh.

39
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:43,805
Sh, sh! It's okay.

40
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,403
It's all right. It's all right.

41
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,415
Give me that.

42
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:07,746
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

43
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:09,276
Amen. Amen.

44
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,136
You go hunt down that damn coyote,

45
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,137
before we lose any more of our chickens.

46
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,324
Uh, pa?

47
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:25,436
Can I come hunt with you?

48
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:28,955
Ask your ma.

49
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,669
Well, can I?

50
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,796
Can I?

51
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:41,906
If you finish your chores.

52
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:51,649
Gotta clean my bed, feed Bess.

53
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,347
What's this?

54
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,998
Ma gave it to me.

55
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:07,564
She said you shot a red major clean off his horse

56
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:08,857
at 700 yards.

57
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,017
I think she said

58
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,337
I could shoot a red major off his horse 700 yards.

59
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:17,324
I can't.

60
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,064
Nobody can.

61
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,953
But you did kill kill rebs.

62
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:24,987
It ain't polite conversation, son.

63
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:29,641
You were a sharp shooter?

64
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,352
I'm still a sharp shooter, boy.

65
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,846
Don't you ever forget it. Goodnight.

66
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:58,265
Hattie McAllister, who would've thought?

67
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:01,951
Grilling pigtails, we used to eat candy

68
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,352
and read books in the back of your daddy's store

69
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:09,631
that someday we'd be homesteading this wild country

70
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:10,732
with the best of them.

71
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:16,432
Are we gonna make it out here?

72
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,994
Just gotta have a little grit.

73
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:21,244
I don't know where to find that anymore.

74
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,450
Sure you do.

75
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,451
I know.

76
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:29,548
Deep down, you're the toughest woman in this territory.

77
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:06,322
Pa shot that coyote from half mile away.

78
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:10,878
Oh, it was more like 100 yards.

79
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:19,458
Good lord, hat. What the hell happened?

80
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:22,434
Ma?

81
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:44,180
Boy's down. Supper's put away.

82
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,646
I'm sorry.

83
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,480
They must have wandered

84
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,615
off the reservation looking for something.

85
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,616
Got no scrap.

86
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:04,978
I want to go home.

87
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,159
All right, if you wanna see your folks,

88
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:10,695
reckon I can get a work with the railroad.

89
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:11,696
Buy you a ticket.

90
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,697
I don't want a ticket.

91
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:16,684
I want to pack the wagon and take our children out

92
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,798
of this god forsaken place.

93
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,914
I know it's been hard, but this here's good land.

94
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,358
We live in a shack, Jeb.

95
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,704
We've got old tools, worn out live stock,

96
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:31,754
and can only feed our children

97
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,555
with food borrowed off store credit.

98
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,027
I understand it's been tough.

99
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,883
But this is our dream, Hattie.

100
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,953
This is what we set out to do,

101
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,004
build a home on land we can call our own.

102
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,624
I want you to ask my daddy for a job.

103
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,483
You want us to crawl back to him?

104
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:57,163
We can't make it on our own.

105
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:59,613
Hell, yes, we can. We just gotta keep on going.

106
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,043
Well, I can't.

107
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,102
That's good.

108
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:26,651
I'm gonna ahead into town, grab supplies.

109
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,485
Be a strong boy.

110
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,609
Look after your mom while I'm in town, won't ya?

111
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,096
Here, pa.

112
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:11,099
Jeb. Hiyah, go!

113
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:47,948
I think we've earned it.

114
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,632
Pa says candy's a real treat,

115
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,751
just for Christmas and funerals.

116
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:56,497
When I was a girl in St. Louis,

117
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:57,911
we'd have candy every week.

118
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:00,127
Really?

119
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,987
We'd have ice cream in the summer,

120
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:06,247
toffee in the fall and peppermint sticks at Christmas.

121
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:07,848
You would've loved living there.

122
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:12,547
Is it true that granny and gramps didn't want you

123
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:13,547
to marry pa?

124
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,146
They just had their own ideas

125
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,216
about what they wanted for me.

126
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:22,416
But pa's a hero. He defended Missouri from the rebs.

127
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,744
Your pa was a reb.

128
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,087
He used it to be join up to save the union.

129
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,217
Things weren't simple back then.

130
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:35,327
Will.

131
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,854
I might fine morning to you, ma'am.

132
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,504
And to you.

133
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:17,588
I wonder if we might trouble you for some of your water.

134
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:22,203
Our mounts are about dried out and we're not much better.

135
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:23,554
Take as much as you like.

136
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:25,957
Much obliged.

137
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,174
Will.

138
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,992
What's the matter with you, son.

139
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,843
Didn't your ma teach you any manners?

140
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,322
You didn't have no ma, dropped out of a whore

141
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:00,854
and raised by those fur traders, is what I heard.

142
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,656
I do apologize, ma'am.

143
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:07,981
We have been in the saddle for about three months now

144
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,741
and I'm afraid it is beginning to show.

145
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,341
Um, I couldn't help, but notice your Coop over yonder,

146
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:17,431
I, I wonder if I might offer to buy some salt pork

147
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,591
and maybe a dozen eggs.

148
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:20,992
Fetch as many as you need.

149
00:25:24,134 --> 00:25:25,134
Well.

150
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,011
I must confess,

151
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,204
I, I do feel a bit forward talking business with a lady.

152
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,934
Uh, is your husband at home?

153
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:38,164
He ain't here. He gone to town.

154
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:45,090
Oh, well then I guess that makes you the man

155
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,241
of the house, I reckon.

156
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,683
Oh, uh, one more thing.

157
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,609
Is that a Missouri accent that I detect.

158
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,869
St. Louis.

159
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,319
I knew it. What a happy coincidence.

160
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,949
I am a Cameron man, myself, that big fella over there,

161
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,596
he's from Arkansas, but we try not to hold that against it.

162
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,318
We don't get many missourians out this way.

163
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,972
No, ma'am, I expect you don't.

164
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:35,262
I'd be happy to cook you men some breakfast before you go.

165
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:39,661
Well, we would be much obliged.

166
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:51,758
This is very kind of you, ma'am.

167
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:07,166
Those your folks over there, Mrs. Uh?

168
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,696
McAllister. McAllister.

169
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:11,670
Hattie. This is Bess and this is will.

170
00:27:12,657 --> 00:27:13,657
Set the table.

171
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:18,926
How old are you?

172
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:21,025
Nine and three quarters.

173
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:24,629
Why then, I reckon that's big enough to wear one of these.

174
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:34,315
This is a lovely home you have here, Mrs. McAllister.

175
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:35,819
Your husband is a lucky man.

176
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:48,774
She wants to talk.

177
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:50,638
Oh, now here, allow me.

178
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,005
I've held a baby at two in my life.

179
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,744
Yeah. You okay?

180
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:58,745
Yeah.

181
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:10,181
Now Dixie forever

182
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:13,012
she's never at a loss

183
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,182
down with the eagle

184
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:18,172
up with the cross.

185
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:20,480
We will rally around the flag, boys

186
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,929
we'll rally 'round again

187
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,089
shout, shout the battle cry of

188
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,030
freedom

189
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:36,199
Now Dixie forever

190
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,656
she's never had a loss

191
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:39,831
Bess.

192
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:42,594
Down with the eagle

193
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,762
and up with the cross

194
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,168
gonna go fetch some eggs.

195
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:47,441
We will rally round the flag, boys

196
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:49,431
we'll rally 'round again

197
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:50,432
yeah. Come on.

198
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:52,720
Shout shout

199
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,198
the battle cry of freedom

200
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,691
hey, hey. Hey.

201
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:57,805
Is that a reb song?

202
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:12,050
Need to teach her that song.

203
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,420
You never heard that song before.

204
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,504
You like that song?

205
00:30:06,257 --> 00:30:08,198
Happy girl now, doo, doo

206
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:14,316
What a gentle little soul she is.

207
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:20,931
You ain' got a problem with rebs, now do you, boy.

208
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:27,617
Our young host was born after hostilities ended.

209
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,411
I'm sure he's a proud American, aren't you, boy.

210
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:32,957
Nothing wrong with that,

211
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,867
man should be loyal to his own country.

212
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:36,868
Not everybody is.

213
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,027
My daddy was a sharp shooter.

214
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:42,027
Was he now?

215
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:45,916
Will's not a bad shot himself.

216
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:47,296
Why don't you go show these gentlemen

217
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,247
that shotgun your daddy got you.

218
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,066
Easy now. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

219
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,350
Let me see that.

220
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:04,623
Oh my goodness.

221
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:11,482
Those rebs best be careful coming around here.

222
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:16,483
Oh.

223
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,626
Will, warm up the coffee.

224
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,764
Hope you like strawberry jam.

225
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:35,564
That's all we could grow this spring.

226
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,548
Oh, I'm sure we like it just fine.

227
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:43,518
Before we dig in, boys, we like to have a little prayer.

228
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:45,798
Keep us humble.

229
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:48,894
Lord,

230
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:53,773
please look down on us and help us to be grateful

231
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:56,233
for these gifts that we have been given

232
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:59,053
and help us to be always mindful

233
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:03,283
of the needs of others and not think only of ourselves.

234
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:06,643
We pray in the name of your son, Jesus Christ.

235
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,773
Amen. Amen.

236
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:09,715
All right.

237
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:12,974
Ma!

238
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:19,726
Will, get behind the stove with your sister. Now!

239
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:34,185
There must be some misunderstanding, ma'am.

240
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:36,315
How have we offended?

241
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,895
I don't feed killers in my house.

242
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,002
Killers.

243
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,595
Good lord.

244
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:50,411
Oh, oh, I see the confusion.

245
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:52,931
Boy, she is talking about those trophies

246
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:55,964
that we got off that Cheyenne trader near fort laramie.

247
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,950
Ma'am, I realize that's an unseemly business,

248
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,930
but those can be very valuable objects

249
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:04,420
when you're trading in the back country.

250
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:07,941
Now can't we just sit back down

251
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,090
and talk about something more pleasant.

252
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:11,774
We were having such a nice time.

253
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:15,584
I think it's best you go now.

254
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,289
What the hell are we waiting for?

255
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,153
She's only got two rounds.

256
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,699
As you wish.

257
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,193
And leave your guns.

258
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
The hell we will.

259
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,249
Ma'am, I'm sure you understand

260
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,962
how valuable these weapons are.

261
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,742
You can trade your scalps for some new ones.

262
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:53,999
You heard the woman.

263
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,877
Uh-uh, these were my pa's.

264
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:06,131
They took him off his dead body of pea Ridge.

265
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:11,538
Fine.

266
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:22,511
Can I have my hat?

267
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:25,258
Will, give him his hat.

268
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:22,048
Hiyah!

269
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,456
Help me.

270
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:07,621
Push! Push!

271
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,254
Son of a bitch!

272
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:47,088
398
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:48,171
Ah, get down!

273
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:57,999
Wait a sec! Come and see!

274
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:03,125
Come and see! 

275
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:08,126
Son of a bitch!

276
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,394
Hyah! What the hell are you doing?

277
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:12,812
I want 'em alive!

278
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:19,850
Whoo! She can't shoot for Jack shit.

279
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,652
I need you to be brave. Okay?

280
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:27,653
Okay.

281
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,407
Reload.

282
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,517
Take care of your sister.

283
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,654
Just take what you want and go.

284
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,582
But what we want is you.

285
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,148
I can do anything.

286
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:32,541
Lay track, shoot buffalo, run the teams.

287
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:36,137
I appreciate the interest, Mr. McAllister.

288
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,057
There simply isn't the work.

289
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:40,577
We have more than enough men to meet our needs.

290
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:41,957
There has to be something.

291
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,147
I could even help with the Chuck wagons.

292
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,487
Oh lord, we're not cowboys.

293
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,738
We just bring our food up from down the line.

294
00:41:50,538 --> 00:41:52,248
Good day. Best of luck.

295
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:21,242
You're all right. It's okay.

296
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,773
Here we go.

297
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Okay. Okay.

298
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:33,146
Mrs. McAllister.

299
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,273
Hide your sister.

300
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:09,917
Mrs. McAllister. That's far enough.

301
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:14,354
I regret that we got off on the wrong foot.

302
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:19,577
I would like for us to start over, make it right.

303
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:24,102
There's nothing to talk about,

304
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:27,016
except you men getting on your horses and riding off.

305
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:32,476
I respect how you must be feeling and I can sympathize,

306
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:38,566
but this standoff not doing anybody a lick of good.

307
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:44,862
It's true that I've done my share of killing

308
00:43:44,863 --> 00:43:46,545
both during the war and after.

309
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:49,875
But one thing I ain't never done,

310
00:43:51,102 --> 00:43:53,505
I ain't never hurt a woman or a child.

311
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,412
Why should I believe a word you say.

312
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:04,815
I had a daughter once.

313
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:10,604
She was my only child, apple of my eye.

314
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:19,000
Every bit of love and affection a father can give

315
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,624
I lavished on that child.

316
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:26,504
She's dead now.

317
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:30,343
Buried out Cameron way.

318
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,883
I swear on her grave,

319
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,959
I will not harm a hair on your head

320
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,610
or on the heads of your children.

321
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:55,219
Dammit!

322
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,319
Damn fools!

323
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,668
You okay? You okay?

324
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:46,132
I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to wake her.

325
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:47,659
That's all right.

326
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,979
Bring her here.

327
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,063
Come on, Bess.

328
00:46:28,148 --> 00:46:29,828
What are they doing with Daisy?

329
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:39,015
No.

330
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,430
No!

331
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,226
No.

332
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:15,436
Sorry.

333
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:22,924
Now, you hold him.

334
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:26,137
Oh, hell, captain, it'll heal itself.

335
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,073
It'll heal on its own, captain.

336
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:30,181
It'll heal on its own.

337
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:32,727
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, no.

338
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,905
Please refrain from that papist blasphemy.

339
00:47:35,906 --> 00:47:37,130
Open his sleeve.

340
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:41,830
Damn them all to hell! 

341
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:45,706
Well I reckon that all the sufferings of this present age

342
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:47,635
are not worthy compared to the glory,

343
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,002
which shall be revealed in us.

344
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:59,226
It's gonna be all right.

345
00:47:59,227 --> 00:48:03,450
Pa couldn't have been reb, ma, just couldn't have been.

346
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:05,101
That's what you're upset about?

347
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:10,954
Your pa's no rebel.

348
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,500
He may have begun fighting for the south,

349
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,353
but he ended that war a patriot.

350
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:20,904
But you said that he was-

351
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:23,105
good and bad aren't always so clear, will.

352
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,197
Sometimes you wake up

353
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:28,199
and you realize you're on the wrong side of things.

354
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
And when you pa did,

355
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:32,279
he have the courage to make things right.

356
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,663
Just like he always does.

357
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:42,692
And when he comes back,

358
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,772
those killers outside are gonna feel god's wrath.

359
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:52,022
What if they kill him instead?

360
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:20,371
Better eat up, son.

361
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,810
Hard to be brave on an empty belly.

362
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:33,270
Well, captain, there's,

363
00:49:35,877 --> 00:49:37,556
there's just something about all this

364
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,170
that I don't rightly understand.

365
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:44,556
Go on.

366
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:49,349
Well, it's all you said about not hurting women or kids.

367
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:56,306
And you think we ought to stand by that.

368
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:07,434
You remember when your pappy and I rode out

369
00:50:07,435 --> 00:50:11,004
to defend our way of life from the tyrant Lincoln.

370
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:12,005
I do.

371
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:15,845
We had a lot of fine ideas then

372
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:20,004
about chivalry and honor

373
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:23,488
and what war should look like.

374
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:29,637
How the rightness of our cause would carry us to victory.

375
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:38,937
And the Yankees stole our cattle.

376
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:42,473
They burned our farms

377
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:46,287
and hung our kin without cause.

378
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,614
And all our fine notions were nothing

379
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:56,623
in the face of their rapacious, murderous hatred.

380
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:07,976
They took my only child from me,

381
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,102
ripped her from this life

382
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:18,535
without mercy or pity.

383
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:27,062
And there ain't no law on earth

384
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:30,602
or in heaven or hell

385
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:37,854
that can keep a father from taking his revenge.

386
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:42,421
Not the devil

387
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:49,914
And not god himself.

388
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:01,720
That make things any clearer?

389
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,850
Hell, we ain't gonna have to hurt anybody anyway.

390
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,113
How you figure that?

391
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:24,142
Mrs. McAllister ain't cut out for this kinda life.

392
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,162
I can tell that by looking in her eyes.

393
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:31,522
We give her enough time,

394
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:34,642
she's just gonna come on out here to us.

395
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,712
That's the sensible thing to do.

396
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:43,711
And she is a sensible woman.

397
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:45,201
Captain! What?

398
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:49,228
The hell.

399
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:52,527
Damnation!

400
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,262
They'll see that for miles.

401
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,806
Ma!

402
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:28,358
Keep it burning, you understand?

403
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:29,877
Anything you can find.

404
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,305
Look.

405
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:10,315
Will, your sister.

406
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,526
Come to a help.

407
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,180
The children are still inside?

408
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,880
You come alone, neighbor?

409
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,719
Yeah, I see the smoke, I come riding real fast.

410
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,042
Why? What's wrong.

411
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:10,339
Mr. Sameson, no, go get help.

412
00:56:13,238 --> 00:56:14,675
Get help!

413
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:16,388
No. I want him alive.

414
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:18,992
Ride, Mr. Sameson, ride!

415
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:07,234
Let it burn!

416
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:09,690
Are you crazy? Captain wants them alive.

417
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:24,296
Just trying to help.

418
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,822
Let him go.

419
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:49,261
Mrs. McAllister, I'm surprised.

420
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:52,745
It does not dignify a woman to holler and carry on such.

421
00:58:53,972 --> 00:58:55,622
He hasn't done anything to you.

422
00:58:58,261 --> 00:58:59,761
Well, that is entirely true.

423
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,821
But as you see,

424
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:06,964
your obstinance has put us all in a difficult situation.

425
00:59:09,563 --> 00:59:12,750
So I'm gonna ask you again to come out here

426
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:15,604
and let us resolve this like civilized people.

427
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,583
Hattie, you stay there.

428
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,360
He's a no good liar.

429
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:22,361
He can't be trusted.

430
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:26,113
Of course, you'd rather not be civilized.

431
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,143
I'll have to resort to other methods.

432
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,369
You don't have to do this.

433
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:39,363
I'd hope not to. See, I'm a preacher's son.

434
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,869
I was raised to believe in the good book.

435
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,933
It's the only thing that keeps us from being savages.

436
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,308
But even a preacher's boy has got his limits.

437
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:53,462
Please. He has a wife and five children.

438
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,328
The lord is my Shepherd.

439
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:58,329
I shall not want.

440
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:00,448
You made me to lay down.

441
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:02,338
I don't like repeating myself.

442
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:03,172
He led me besides the still waters.

443
01:00:03,173 --> 01:00:07,138
Mrs. McAllister, so I'm gonna say this

444
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:08,312
one more time.

445
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:10,309
Come on out!

446
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,308
In the valley of the shadow off death,

447
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,277
I will fear no evil.

448
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,305
No. No.

449
01:00:16,306 --> 01:00:18,095
For thou art with me.

450
01:02:21,893 --> 01:02:23,816
You left it across the street.

451
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:28,022
See?

452
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:33,441
Maybe I best come down and escort you across.

453
01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:35,419
No, miss, I'm quite all right.

454
01:02:41,902 --> 01:02:45,025
Hey. You really gonna drive home half liquored up?

455
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:48,140
Seems to me you ought to sober up

456
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:50,874
or just go on, get drunk all the way.

457
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:54,837
I gotta get home to my farm.

458
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,044
Farm? Your farm ain't gonna miss you.

459
01:02:59,031 --> 01:03:01,250
We got real nice beds in there.

460
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:04,010
Soft satin sheets.

461
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:05,600
Oh, you could sleep all night.

462
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:07,351
Wake up first thing in the morning.

463
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,490
Of course, you can do other things too.

464
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:13,123
My wife.

465
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:14,563
Your wife? She's waiting on me.

466
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:19,069
Something tells me your wife,

467
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,663
she don't appreciate you,

468
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:28,060
hard workin' man like you, not the way you deserve.

469
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:33,243
Oh, geez!

470
01:03:52,085 --> 01:03:53,168
Hyah!

471
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,941
I think it's time you learned how to make some coffee.

472
01:04:02,268 --> 01:04:03,518
First, put on some water.

473
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,690
Now we need to grind up some beans.

474
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,050
You want 'em fine like table salt.

475
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:38,827
Can we boil 'em?

476
01:04:39,707 --> 01:04:41,085
That may be how cow hands

477
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:42,705
make some black sludge they call coffee,

478
01:04:42,706 --> 01:04:44,265
but it's not the proper way.

479
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:45,915
Well, what do we do different?

480
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,266
How's that grind looking?

481
01:04:54,526 --> 01:04:56,055
Just like salt.

482
01:04:56,056 --> 01:04:57,225
Good.

483
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,326
Now find something we can use as a filter.

484
01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:30,284
Now we wait for it to boil.

485
01:05:32,384 --> 01:05:34,234
You wanna know how your pa and I met?

486
01:05:38,204 --> 01:05:41,054
I was walking home from school one day back in St. Louis.

487
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:46,093
It was during the war and the streets were full of soldiers.

488
01:05:46,094 --> 01:05:48,132
One bunch decided they wanted to have some fun.

489
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:51,942
So they stole my books.

490
01:05:51,943 --> 01:05:54,072
I begged and pleaded for them to give 'em back.

491
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:55,073
But they wouldn't.

492
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:59,112
And just when I started to cry,

493
01:05:59,113 --> 01:06:01,186
I heard someone order those boys to stop.

494
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:05,412
I turned around expecting a lieutenant or a captain,

495
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:06,796
but it was just your pa.

496
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,515
He was all alone,

497
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:13,395
in a private's uniform no less.

498
01:06:15,432 --> 01:06:17,381
There was one man against six,

499
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:21,371
but there was something in his voice,

500
01:06:21,372 --> 01:06:22,841
something that said he could still lick

501
01:06:22,842 --> 01:06:26,265
every single one of them, one at a time or all together.

502
01:06:28,182 --> 01:06:30,341
When they heard it, one by one,

503
01:06:30,342 --> 01:06:31,481
they started to drift away

504
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:34,784
till the last one, gave me back my books and apologized.

505
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:42,010
Your pa asked me if he could walk me home.

506
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:45,404
I said, yes, but in my heart, I already knew.

507
01:06:48,007 --> 01:06:49,007
Knew what?

508
01:06:53,379 --> 01:06:56,711
That he was the man I wanted to marry.

509
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:01,089
That nothing in this world could ever cause him to give up

510
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,513
and whatever would come, he would stand up and protect me.

511
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:14,623
All right, now pour it over the beans, nice and slow.

512
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,538
How about some more rock candy?

513
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:39,488
Can't trick your coffee black, can you?

514
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:01,447
Will. Will!

515
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,217
I need you to keep watch.

516
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:13,507
I'll be right back.

517
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:24,849
Psst, psst!

518
01:08:28,176 --> 01:08:29,176
Ma!

519
01:08:32,586 --> 01:08:33,586
Don't shoot.

520
01:08:35,136 --> 01:08:36,279
I just come the talk.

521
01:08:38,676 --> 01:08:40,315
You so much as flinch

522
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,539
and I swear, I'll put a bullet through your heart.

523
01:08:43,476 --> 01:08:44,476
I ain't armed.

524
01:08:46,446 --> 01:08:48,334
Right through your heart.

525
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:49,335
Please.

526
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:54,107
The others don't know I come.

527
01:08:54,108 --> 01:08:55,158
Will you just listen?

528
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:59,025
All right. Talk then.

529
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:03,664
This ain't what I thought I was joining.

530
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:06,484
We was supposed to Rob banks and trains,

531
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,318
not hurt women and children.

532
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:12,834
It just don't sit right with me no more.

533
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:16,383
You stood by why I killed my neighbor.

534
01:09:16,384 --> 01:09:18,573
If I'd done said anything,

535
01:09:18,574 --> 01:09:20,374
I'd be lying dead on the ground too.

536
01:09:23,134 --> 01:09:25,143
I remember my mama once warned me

537
01:09:25,144 --> 01:09:27,127
about falling in with bad company.

538
01:09:28,714 --> 01:09:30,993
Once I did, I didn't realize

539
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,706
how hard it would be to part ways.

540
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:36,006
Who are they?

541
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:39,024
They're a gang from Missouri.

542
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:42,902
They rode with quantrill's raiders during the war.

543
01:09:42,903 --> 01:09:44,736
Captain was his right hand man.

544
01:09:46,413 --> 01:09:50,462
Most of the fellers gave up when old quantrill was killed

545
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,602
or after the surrender.

546
01:09:51,603 --> 01:09:52,746
But not captain.

547
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:55,355
The war ain't never ended for him.

548
01:10:00,272 --> 01:10:02,705
Look, if if'n I help you,

549
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:06,895
will you put in a good world with the us Marshall for me?

550
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,855
Right then, here's my plan.

551
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:16,290
The others are sleeping and I'm supposed to be on watch.

552
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:19,080
If you and the young ones can get out of the window,

553
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,600
I'll meet you back about a hundred paces.

554
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:22,601
I'll bring horses.

555
01:10:24,331 --> 01:10:25,800
You can get 'em without waking them.

556
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:27,801
I already done got 'em all saddled up.

557
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:36,661
I'll get the children ready.

558
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:39,293
We'll meet you in 10 minutes.

559
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:43,628
All right.

560
01:10:43,629 --> 01:10:44,517
Thank you.

561
01:10:44,518 --> 01:10:47,980
And we can ride on out afore anyone's wiser

562
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,193
and then go find Jeb.

563
01:10:57,539 --> 01:10:59,372
Jed! Son of a bitch!

564
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:02,792
She got him, captain.

565
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:06,602
Now I gotta tell his mama!

566
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:10,708
That dang fool kid couldn't lie for shit!

567
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:12,088
You mind your tongue.

568
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:14,402
Ma, he was just trying to help!

569
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:22,202
I never told him your pa's name, not one time.

570
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,888
Then how did they know it?

571
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,597
They're not after us.

572
01:11:27,598 --> 01:11:29,098
They came looking for your pa.

573
01:11:32,638 --> 01:11:35,247
That's why they're out there taking their time.

574
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:37,497
That's why they're out there now waiting.

575
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:38,498
We're just the bait.

576
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:41,541
Your father's walking into a trap.

577
01:11:42,748 --> 01:11:46,989
Will, I'm gonna need you to do something.

578
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,830
And you're gonna have to be brave to do it.

579
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,307
I need you to get the filly.

580
01:11:54,807 --> 01:11:57,919
What? No, I can't.

581
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,473
Yes, you can.

582
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:01,170
You're your father's son.

583
01:12:03,177 --> 01:12:05,140
It's our turn to protect him.

584
01:13:10,964 --> 01:13:15,963
That little yankee bastard! 

585
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,257
They took that yankee bastard

586
01:13:40,258 --> 01:13:42,684
they shot him in the head

587
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,352
they put him on the fire

588
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,936
so if mama saw he's dead

589
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:54,878
Sh!

590
01:13:59,282 --> 01:14:01,031
It's okay. It's okay.

591
01:14:06,348 --> 01:14:08,905
The yankee's went to Baltimore

592
01:14:08,906 --> 01:14:12,573
and they came upon a mare

593
01:14:51,317 --> 01:14:53,082
Hell, captain,

594
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:56,613
the horses are running to kingdom come!

595
01:14:56,614 --> 01:14:59,237
You get her!

596
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:01,829
Oh, come on.

597
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:12,784
Son of a bitch! Get back here.

598
01:15:15,338 --> 01:15:17,811
Will! Will!

599
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:20,178
Think you're going.

600
01:15:22,765 --> 01:15:26,061
You know, captain, he didn't mean you no harm before,

601
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:28,371
but he does now.

602
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:38,009
Easy.

603
01:15:44,894 --> 01:15:46,515
No! No!

604
01:15:46,516 --> 01:15:50,522
No! No!

605
01:15:50,523 --> 01:15:53,816
You don't move. You understand me?

606
01:15:53,817 --> 01:15:55,067
Don't you move!

607
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:59,403
Oh my god, my god, she got my face!

608
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:01,862
Will, run!

609
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:03,604
She got my face!

610
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:06,198
God, she got my damn face!

611
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:08,366
Will, run! Run!

612
01:17:57,817 --> 01:17:58,900
Go, run! Ma!

613
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,093
Go! Take her!

614
01:18:03,935 --> 01:18:04,768
You run, just take her.

615
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:07,293
Go to the danielsons. Go! 

616
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:08,791
Go! Go!

617
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:13,605
Come here, you!

618
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:20,508
Come here, I got you!

619
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:25,509
Get out of there! Let go!

620
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:28,303
Where'd you go?

621
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:32,637
Come on out, I won't hurt ya.

622
01:18:39,202 --> 01:18:40,202
Bitch!

623
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,311
That was a damn fool thing you done back there.

624
01:19:04,568 --> 01:19:06,101
Almost got yourself killed.

625
01:19:07,628 --> 01:19:11,077
I told you, I ain't never harmed a woman.

626
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,117
Captain, when we gonna go get that little yankee bastard?

627
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:14,976
Shut your mouth.

628
01:19:14,977 --> 01:19:16,827
We got everything we need right here.

629
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:21,006
All we gotta do is get Mrs. McAllister back home

630
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:22,961
before she catches her death out here.

631
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:24,156
Yeah, but you told me I could get him

632
01:19:24,157 --> 01:19:25,386
and bring him back here and cut his-

633
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:28,036
shut your belly achin' rotten mouth!

634
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:50,176
You move, you die.

635
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:08,104
You want to see how it feels to get your flesh burned off?

636
01:20:08,105 --> 01:20:09,428
Gentle does it, boys.

637
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:19,354
As it says in ecclesiastes:

638
01:20:19,355 --> 01:20:21,243
Cast thy bread upon the waters

639
01:20:21,244 --> 01:20:23,917
for thou shalt find it after many days.

640
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:45,553
Jeb!

641
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:48,916
Care to die?

642
01:20:55,773 --> 01:20:57,973
This ain't no way to start a conversation.

643
01:20:59,643 --> 01:21:00,786
Let her go, Miller.

644
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:03,876
It's captain Miller to you.

645
01:21:05,283 --> 01:21:07,332
I'd appreciate it if you'd remember that.

646
01:21:13,322 --> 01:21:14,522
Where are my children?

647
01:21:16,112 --> 01:21:17,341
They're safe.

648
01:21:17,342 --> 01:21:18,842
They made it across the river.

649
01:21:22,352 --> 01:21:24,752
You still call yourself a confederate officer.

650
01:21:25,862 --> 01:21:27,962
You got no right to hold a woman prisoner.

651
01:21:30,038 --> 01:21:32,610
"For a man shall leave his father and mother

652
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,080
and cleave unto his wife.

653
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:36,180
And they shall be as one flesh."

654
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:39,090
Genesis chapter two, 24th verse.

655
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:42,180
Your sins have found you out, jebediah McAllister,

656
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:44,644
and now they are visited upon your whole family.

657
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:57,670
What do you want?

658
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,439
Vengeance.

659
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,689
Vengeance belongs to the lord, Miller.

660
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,883
Well, the lord takes too damn long.

661
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:11,279
Now I can see that I am being less than clear.

662
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,543
So let me be blunt.

663
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:17,008
You either put that gun down

664
01:22:17,009 --> 01:22:18,208
or your pretty little wife

665
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,612
is gonna have her eyes cut out of her head.

666
01:22:22,049 --> 01:22:23,852
You said you never hurt a woman.

667
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:28,472
I haven't, but he has.

668
01:22:33,299 --> 01:22:36,057
My daughter has laid

669
01:22:36,058 --> 01:22:38,757
in her grave for 12 years,

670
01:22:38,758 --> 01:22:41,667
while her murderers have walked free.

671
01:22:41,668 --> 01:22:43,797
We didn't murder anyone.

672
01:22:43,798 --> 01:22:44,728
It was an accident.

673
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:45,871
She trusted you.

674
01:22:47,578 --> 01:22:50,427
She trusted you because you were her countryman.

675
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:54,151
Not one man there knew she was inside. Ask him!

676
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:59,430
Not one man there draws breath, except you.

677
01:23:02,307 --> 01:23:04,020
We thought it was you in there.

678
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,970
No, only my heart.

679
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:20,365
Make it slow.

680
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:22,789
Jeb! 

681
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:28,705
You swear, you won't hurt her. You'll let her go.

682
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:30,745
No, no, Jeb!

683
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:32,249
On my child's grave.

684
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:35,416
You can't trust him.

685
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,416
No.

686
01:23:45,206 --> 01:23:46,623
No, no, no, no!

687
01:23:55,549 --> 01:23:56,549
No, no!

688
01:23:58,132 --> 01:24:01,848
Ain't having no more little bastards now!

689
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:09,049
Hope you don't mind, jebediah.

690
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,776
The pleasure's all mine.

691
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:12,223
You son of a bitch!

692
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,937
Come on, Princess!

693
01:24:33,863 --> 01:24:37,686
His daughter? Why did you never tell me.

694
01:24:40,153 --> 01:24:43,256
Bad enough if I had to kill men for the confederacy,

695
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,462
I murdered a child for the union.

696
01:24:46,463 --> 01:24:48,263
It wasn't murder. You didn't know.

697
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,485
It doesn't matter to him.

698
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,051
When he finishes what he is gonna do,

699
01:24:57,052 --> 01:25:00,047
you ride outta here and don't look back.

700
01:25:00,048 --> 01:25:02,631
I'm not leaving, now or ever.

701
01:26:03,839 --> 01:26:05,539
Well. Mrs. McAllister,

702
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:08,692
pride goeth before a fall.

703
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:20,168
Now, I think that you deserve to have a front row seat

704
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:24,617
for this trial because of your close relationship

705
01:26:24,618 --> 01:26:25,941
with the accused.

706
01:26:30,258 --> 01:26:32,031
Jebediah McAllister,

707
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:37,637
you are here by charged with crimes against god

708
01:26:37,638 --> 01:26:39,801
and the confederate states of america,

709
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:42,800
including a murder of a child.

710
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:47,990
How do you plead?

711
01:26:50,147 --> 01:26:51,697
I have done what I have done.

712
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:54,897
You have heard the confession.

713
01:26:56,957 --> 01:26:57,957
Don't hit my wife!

714
01:27:00,017 --> 01:27:01,713
Gentlemen of the jury-

715
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:02,547
Wahoo!

716
01:27:02,548 --> 01:27:04,456
How do you find the defendant?

717
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:11,025
Guilty as hell, captain.

718
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:12,049
Guilty as hell.

719
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:19,173
You got no right.

720
01:27:22,726 --> 01:27:24,979
Look what you have wrought, McAllister.

721
01:27:27,405 --> 01:27:29,455
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

722
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:34,334
You don't give a damn what I have to say.

723
01:27:34,335 --> 01:27:36,047
Go on, do what you gotta do.

724
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:37,215
No!

725
01:27:39,275 --> 01:27:41,401
Are you familiar with the book of romans?

726
01:27:45,112 --> 01:27:49,661
"For all, have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god."

727
01:27:50,984 --> 01:27:53,713
And I have no doubt that god will forgive you-

728
01:27:53,714 --> 01:27:54,547
no!

729
01:27:54,548 --> 01:27:56,034
Through the blood of his son.

730
01:28:00,434 --> 01:28:02,141
But I ain't god.

731
01:28:05,818 --> 01:28:07,401
I'll do anything!

732
01:28:08,594 --> 01:28:10,594
I said, I'd do anything!

733
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:13,763
Anything?

734
01:28:17,953 --> 01:28:19,036
Each man here.

735
01:28:21,973 --> 01:28:23,746
Entirely of your own free will.

736
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:28,670
Hattie, no.

737
01:28:30,253 --> 01:28:32,116
Well. Not for me.

738
01:28:33,478 --> 01:28:35,263
Hattie, no! What do you say?

739
01:28:36,822 --> 01:28:38,405
Hattie, no.

740
01:28:39,475 --> 01:28:41,225
Don't do it!
Woo-ie!

741
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:45,668
Hattie, no.

742
01:28:46,826 --> 01:28:48,326
Don't do it, no!

743
01:28:49,686 --> 01:28:50,686
Hattie!

744
01:29:01,274 --> 01:29:02,590
Now I expect you to conduct yourself

745
01:29:02,591 --> 01:29:05,724
like a southern gentleman in there. 

746
01:29:10,691 --> 01:29:13,930
I am going to allow you to watch your wife,

747
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,471
make herself into a whore

748
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:20,000
and then I'm gonna kill ya just the same.

749
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:44,696
Take off your gun belt and leave it by the door.

750
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:48,319
I can put some perfume on if you like.

751
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:53,622
I got a bottle in just last year from New York.

752
01:30:29,384 --> 01:30:34,384
"And behold, the pale rider which sat on him,

753
01:30:34,537 --> 01:30:36,024
his name was death."

754
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,789
"And hell followed with him."

755
01:32:37,267 --> 01:32:42,266
Go to hell, you son of a bitch. 

756
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:56,602
Hey, hurry it up in there.

757
01:32:57,591 --> 01:33:01,764
My pecker's getting antsy. 

758
01:33:08,808 --> 01:33:13,808
Son of a bitch shot me again! 

759
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:19,948
Kill 'em all!

760
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:55,120
I'm all right. All right.

761
01:34:11,358 --> 01:34:13,302
Where are you going?

762
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:26,495
What are you doing?

763
01:34:38,097 --> 01:34:39,597
Go on.

764
01:35:18,938 --> 01:35:20,355
Thank you, frank.

765
01:35:23,203 --> 01:35:24,453
You avenged her

766
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:28,197
as if she was yours.

767
01:35:31,794 --> 01:35:36,107
May all his glory be revealed you, my brother. 

768
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:04,345
And upon the wicked, he shall rain snares.

769
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:08,012
Fire!

770
01:36:10,402 --> 01:36:11,816
And brimstone!

771
01:36:12,653 --> 01:36:14,192
And a horrible tempest

772
01:36:17,752 --> 01:36:19,452
shall be the portion of their cup.

773
01:36:29,421 --> 01:36:31,374
This is not the end, McAllister.

774
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:38,281
You hear me?

775
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:40,614
This is just the beginning.

776
01:36:41,901 --> 01:36:46,254
The inequities of the father will visited upon the children!

777
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,400
I am gonna hunt down your girl and boy!

778
01:36:56,912 --> 01:37:01,245
I don't care how years, I don't care how many miles!

779
01:37:02,832 --> 01:37:04,249
I will find them!

780
01:37:06,023 --> 01:37:07,023
Jeb.

781
01:37:19,704 --> 01:37:21,882
You son of a bitch!

782
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:04,930
Hey!

783
01:38:09,064 --> 01:38:10,064
Jebediah.

784
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:24,144
It is finished!

785
01:40:43,893 --> 01:40:47,905
Until the end

786
01:40:47,906 --> 01:40:52,728
I'll walk with you.

787
01:40:52,729 --> 01:40:57,728
I'll walk with you, my love

788
01:41:00,114 --> 01:41:04,390
and with my heart

789
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:08,213
I'll speak the truth

790
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:11,547
and only then, to you.

791
01:41:48,425 --> 01:41:53,425
Glory be to all our love

792
01:41:53,864 --> 01:41:58,864
that flows a mighty river

793
01:42:00,984 --> 01:42:05,984
and glory to the open plains

794
01:42:08,506 --> 01:42:12,256
that hold it like no other.
