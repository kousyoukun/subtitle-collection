开始，我惊呆了
At first, I was in shock.

26
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:52,830
我机械地反应着，亳无知觉
I just functioned automatically.
I didn't feel anything.

27
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,254
然后有一天我猛然刺痛，凯西走了
Then one day it hit me: Joanna and Kathy are gone.

I kept walking around the apartment.I guess I was half crazy.

你不必住旅馆，有很多房子供你住
You don't need to stay in that hotel.There's plenty of room for you here.

37
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:53,516
我去找家出租房，我有一些东西要出版

- When was the house last occupied?

46
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:41,499
我们计划把它改成博物馆

47
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:46,546
但是我猜这房子是用来住人的
But I guess the house was meant to be lived in.

48
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:52,510
为什么还没有人住
我去年加入协会的
- Why hasn't it been lived in?
- I joined the society last year.

49
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,890
我想他们在这栋房子没花功夫
I don't think they've tried very hard with this place.

50
00:09:57,098 --> 00:10:00,727
当然它需要很多整修工作

这里有几件东西是刚搬进来的

还有...这是音乐房

56
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,176
这是我把你和这个房间想到一起的真正原因
This is really why I thought of you and this house.

57
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:38,348
协会接手时钢琴留在了这里
The piano was left here when the society took over.

58
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:42,894
它肯定不好使了

59
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:47,232
这些是什么

- Manage to do any writing?

63
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:34,714
讲座可能给你一点灵感

64
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:57,278

外面没有下雨

69
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:22,470
这里有很多人没有更好的事情可做
...there are an awful lot of people here with nothing better to do.

70
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,268
但是，第二次讲座后我们将知道更多
However, we'll know moreafter the second lecture.

71
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:34,524
我敢肯定你们当中很多人会认识到这一点
I’m sure there are many of you who may recognize this.

72
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:12,020
管弦乐队听起来好些
你在课堂上奏得动听
- It sounds better with an orchestra.

Since I’ve been with the society,the house has been empty.

You're working very hard.You've been through emotional strain.

126

There's a call for you. Your mother.Should I tell her you're busy?

128
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:35,974
对不起 约翰
Excuse me, John.

129
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:47,444
你的租房有问题 拉塞尔先生
There's some question about your lease, Mr. Russell.

130
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:54,494
那栋房子不能出租的，诺曼小姐没有仔细看文件
That house shouldn't have been rented.Miss Norman rushed the papers through.

131
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:59,917
她没有通过正当的途径
为什么有反对
- She did not use proper channels.
- Why should anyone object?

132
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:05,382
那栋房子不适合住人
That house is not fit to live in.

133
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,886
没有人能够在那里住下去
No one has been able to live in it.

134
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:15,602
它不欢迎人
于是原先麻烦不断
- It doesn't want people.
- Then there has been trouble before.

135
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,719
C.S.B.1909年1月
C.S.B.JANUARY 1909

136
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:59,221
克莱尔，你听，音阶相符，速度和音调都一样
Claire, listen. It’s note for note.Same tempo and even the same key.

137
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,768
你认为有什么
我不知道
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

138
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:06,354
是个惊人的巧合
It’s a startling coincidence.

139
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:11,319
但是那一定是流行音乐，否则不会在音乐盒里
But that must be a popular melody,or it wouldn't be on the music box.

140
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:17,201
我同意 ，但我以前从未听过那天你来的时候我演奏了
I agree, but I never heard it before I played it that day you came over.

141
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,954
不，其中必有蹊跷
No, there's something!

142
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:23,792
这样的事这里以前发生过，我不是第一个
It’s happened before here.I’m not the first.

143
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,673
我仔细阅了档案，一直追溯到1920年
I went over the files very carefully,all the way back to 1920.

144
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:33,845
一切正常
贺婿礼小姐
- Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Miss Huxley...

145
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:37,516
米尼是个性格古怪的老女人，但是她从未
Minnie's a highly eccentric old woman,but she'd never...

146
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:41,312
她说这个房子不欢迎人，她错了
She said the house didn't want people.She's mistaken.

147
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:45,484
不管是什么都不顾一切的想交流什么
Whatever it is is trying desperately to communicate.

148
00:37:45,692 --> 00:37:51,116
重击，水龙头，破碎的窗玻璃
The banging, the water taps,the broken window panes.

149
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:56,413
一切发生的事都是为了把我带到阁楼
Everything that's happened was designed to get me into the attic.

150
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,917
我想看看
I want to see it.

151
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:19,565
你看桌上的书
Look at that book on the desk.

152
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:32,371
C.S.B.1909年1月4日
C.S.B. January 4th, 1909.

153
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:37,335
是小孩子的字迹
It’s a little child's writing.

154
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:40,922
1909 ，那时谁会住在这里昵
1909.Who could have lived here then?

155
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:47,013
我在壁炉架上找到那个音乐盒
I found the music box on the mantel.

156
00:38:52,352 --> 00:38:55,565
看这轮椅
Look at this wheelchair.

157
00:38:55,774 --> 00:39:01,280
我的天！这么小
My God! It’s so small.

158
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:08,038
这间房子做什么用的
What was this room?

159
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,957
前居住者，威廉·萨拉奇诺及其一家
Former residents,William Saracino and family...

160
00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:49,544
...1965年买下，1967年卖出
...bought the place in 1965,sold it in 1967.

161
00:39:49,752 --> 00:39:56,385
1967年协会买下了，是卡尔迈克尔基金买下的
Purchased for the society in 1967,by the Carmichael Foundation.

162
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:59,806
是议员
是的
- That's the senator?
- Yes.

163
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:06,814
档案在哪儿
没有列出前面的居住者
- Where is the file?
- No previous occupants listed.

164
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:10,401
1920年前什么都没有
There's nothing here before 1920.

165
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:15,782
米尼我们找切斯曼公寓1920年以前的档案
Minnie, we're looking for the Chessman House file pre-1920.

166
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:20,371
你想知道些什么
1909年谁住那儿
- What do you want to know?
- Who lived there in 1909?

167
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:28,046
一个叫巴纳德的先生
他有孩子吗
- A Dr. Barnard.
- Did he have any children?

168
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:31,885
一个儿子一个女儿
A son and a daughter.

169
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:37,558
发生了家庭悲剧，1909年他把房子卖了
There was some kind of family tragedy.He sold the house in 1909.

170
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:41,479
1909 我为你建立档案
1909. I'll set it up for you.

171
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:47,944
一切准备好了，预览器在右边
It’s all ready to go.The scanner is on the right.

172
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,076
我们在这里看看
Let's have a look here.

173
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:59,750

February 9th. These are want ads.Financial page.

174
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,129
房地产 ，更多招租广告
Real estate. More want ads.

175
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:09,970
等下
Wait.

176
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:18,146
科拉巴纳德 沃尔特 巴纳德医生九岁的女儿
"Cora Barnard, seven-year-old daughter of Dr. Walter Barnard...

177
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:24,779
当她在一辆载煤的车子前面奔跑时 被严重撞伤
...was seriously injured when she ran in front of a passing coal cart. "

178
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:28,951
她被送往医院但医治无效
"She was taken to hospital where her condition remains grave. "

179
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,161
因此不久后...
So forth and so on...

180
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,206
科拉巴纳德..C.S.B
Cora Bernard... C.S.B.

181
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,261
这里
There.

182
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,515
科拉斯蒂华德 巴纳德..
"Cora Steward Barnard...

183
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:55,273
...由于2月15日的事故中受伤,长眠地下
...succumbed to injuries sustained in a February 15th accident. "

184
00:41:55,481 --> 00:42:02,489
她的父母沉重哀悼，并将她埋在家庭墓区里
"She is mourned by her parents and will be interred in a family plot. "

185
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:10,415
那是博士和他妻子
There's the doctor and his wife.

186
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:14,044
那是哥哥,劳埃德
There's the brother, Lloyd.

187
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:26,100
这个小女孩,科拉，死于街头
This little girl, Cora,was killed in the street.

188
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:31,522
是一次事故，跟凯西几乎一样
It was an accident,almost the same as Kathy.

189
00:42:37,863 --> 00:42:41,451
那房间里的是什么
What is in that house?

190
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,329
它在干什么？为什么想要告诉我？
What is it doing? Why is it trying to reach me?

191
00:42:44,537 --> 00:42:51,129
是不是因为我女儿？我不能再次经受痛苦
Is it because of my daughter? I can't go through all this again.

192
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:56,176
约翰,你必须离开那栋房子
John, you must get out of that house.

193
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:22,345
我相信你说的一切
I believe everything you're saying.

194
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:26,767
噪音,灯光，物体的心灵运输
The noises, the lights,the teleportation of objects.

195
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:32,482
这是非常有趣的事
但是现在我怎么做
- It’s all fascinating stuff.
- But what do I do now?

196
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:35,277
我告诉你,是花边新闻
I'll tell you, off the record...

197
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:42,869
我们有很多方法，我们检验过很多术士
We have many mediums and spiritualists coming here and we test them.

198
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:47,332
99%纯属骗人
99 percent are utter frauds.

199
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:53,131
但是有1%很令人吃惊
But the one percent... astonishing.

200
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:56,427
一种方法
A medium.

201
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:27,128
拉塞尔先生,你好，我妻子,利亚

203
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,890

204
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:59,749
我可以录下发生的事吗
当然可以

Mr. Russell, would you sit there?
And I'll sit here. Thank you.

206
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:05,784
你受苦了，约翰·拉塞尔，你失去了妻子和孩子
You've suffered, John Russell.You've lost a wife and child.

207
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:12,584

The presence in this house is reaching out to you through that loss.

208
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,800
这里的冤灵很强
The presence is very strong here.

209
00:48:26,975 --> 00:48:33,107
是一个孩子的冤灵，一个孩子灵魂不安

210
00:48:33,316 --> 00:48:36,987
...不能安息
...who cannot rest.

211
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:43,537
冤灵正跟我们在一起
The presence is with us.

212

拉塞尔先生，你能做到这里来吗

234
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:11,416
你能不能跟约翰说？

能不能告诉我们你为什么不能瞑目？

为什么你感到不安？

为什么你还在这栋房子里？

房子

- House. </i>

262
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:20,120

263
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:23,415
不能走路
<i>Can't walk. </i>

264
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:31,926
告诉我们你为什么不瞑目
我爸爸
<i>- Tell us why you are not at rest.

265
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:36,138
是在这栋房子里死的
我房间里
<i>- Did you die in this house?
- My room. </i>

266
00:55:36,347 --> 00:55:40,602
你怎么死的
<i>How did you die?</i>

267
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:44,273
你怎么死的
How did you die?

268
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:49,028
爸爸
<i>Father. </i>

269
00:55:49,237 --> 00:55:53,784
再见
<i>Farewell. </i>

00:55:53,992 --> 00:55:56,788
<i>Sacred Heart. </i>

271
00:55:56,996 --> 00:56:00,583
神圣的心
<i>My medal. </i>

272
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:04,546
爸爸，不要
<i>Father, don't. </i>

273
00:56:49,891 --> 00:56:56,315
我的身体...农场...井
<i>My body... ranch... the well. </i>

274
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:04,073
我的名字...约瑟夫·卡尔迈克尔
<i>My name... Joseph Carmichael. </i>

275
00:58:10,943 --> 00:58:13,404
克莱尔
Claire...

276
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:15,990
是的
Yeah.

277
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:19,286
我抱歉
I’m sorry to...

278
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:25,710
你能来一下吗
Can you come?

279
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:52,282
告诉我们你为什么不能瞑目
我爸爸
<i>- Tell us why you are not at rest.
- My father. </i>

280
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:56,370
你在这房子里死的
我卧室
<i>- Did you die in this house?

00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:02,085

<i>- How did you die?
- Father, don't. </i>

282
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:07,592
我叫约瑟夫·卡尔迈克尔
<i>My name is Joseph Carmichael. </i>

283
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:32,370
我本该叫你们的，我只是需要一个人
I shouldn't have called you.I just needed someone.

284
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:39,963
我在纸上写了东西
I wrote some words on the paper.

285
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:44,425
我写了神圣的心
I wrote Sacred Heart.

286
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:55,313
过去有个叫神圣的心的郡属孤儿院
There used to be a county orphanage named Sacred Heart.

287
00:59:55,522 --> 00:59:58,859
几年前关来
It was closed down years ago.

288
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:03,656
一个孤儿院
对
- An orphanage?
- Yes.

289
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:12,041
那个小孩，约瑟夫·卡尔迈克尔...
That child, Joseph Carmichael...

290
01:00:13,668 --> 01:00:17,881
他在阁楼被人谋杀
He was murdered in this house,
in the attic.

291
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:22,553
然后被埋...然后有个孤儿...
And buried... and then an orphan...

292
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:27,058
停 ，约翰！离开这里
Stop it, John!Move away from this place.

293
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:24,291
贺壻黎小姐来电话，议员，她说有要事
Miss Huxley is on the phone, Senator.She says it's important.

294
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,544
好的，我接
All right, I'll take it.

295
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:42,404
米尼，你好吗？
很好
- Minnie, how are you?
- Fine.

296
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:48,577
他们查阅了档案
再说下他的名字
- They've been through the files.
- Let me have that name again.

297
01:01:50,037 --> 01:01:55,000
约翰·拉塞尔
John Russell.

298
01:01:55,751 --> 01:01:59,004
我很高兴能帮忙
I’m very glad to be of help.

299
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:03,383
再见
Goodbye.

300
01:02:46,717 --> 01:02:49,762
1960年议员竞选
The senator's campaign from 1960.

301
01:02:49,971 --> 01:02:54,266
我从主图书馆得到的，你发现了什么吗？
I got it from the main library.Have you found something?

302
01:02:54,475 --> 01:03:00,189
一份回顾文件，房子装修为博物馆时拟订的
A retrospective, drawn up when the house was to be turned into a museum.

303
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:05,569
理查德·卡尔迈克尔家1899-1906住这所房子
Richard Carmichael and family occupied the house 1899-1906.

304
01:03:05,778 --> 01:03:11,409
理查德是议员的父亲，他母亲生产时死了
Richard was the senator's father.His mother died in childbirth.

305
01:03:11,617 --> 01:03:15,830
这是他的病情的部分记载
Look at the part about his illness.

306
01:03:16,038 --> 01:03:22,503
卡尔迈克尔，他儿子，三岁时患萎缩性关节炎
"Joe Carmichael, his son, at age three contracted atrophic arthritis. "

307
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:30,136
本计划送他去瑞士北部的疗养院的
"It was decided to send him to the Nordbach Sanatorium in Switzerland. "

308
01:03:30,344 --> 01:03:34,682
他和他父亲1960年启程去了欧洲
"He and his father embarked for Europe in 1906."

309
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:39,687
他直到一战结束才来到美国
"He did not set foot upon American soil until the cessation of WW I."

310
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:44,650
你知道他做了什么理查德的儿子，一个生病的孩子
You see how it might have been done.Richard's son, a sick child.

311
01:03:44,859 --> 01:03:48,487
他被他父亲谋杀并秘密地埋掉
He was murdered by his father and buried secretly.

312
01:03:48,696 --> 01:03:54,493
一个6岁 的孤儿代替他并坐船去了海外
He was substituted by a six-year-old orphan and shipped overseas.

313
01:03:54,702 --> 01:03:59,624
按照他父亲的安排为他们工作 ，甚至参战
With the father attending,it all worked for them, even the war.

314
01:03:59,832 --> 01:04:03,919
1918年他回来，那时他18岁
He came back here in 1918,when he was 18 years old.

315
01:04:04,128 --> 01:04:09,258
谁会知道他不是那个残疾小孩？他的地位巩固了
Who was going to know he wasn't the crippled son? He was cured.

316
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:15,181
你认为他知道谋杀和掉包的事吗？
Do you think he knows about the murder and about the replacement?

317
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:20,019
我不知道
一个父亲怎么能作出这样的事？
- I don't know.
- How could a father do such a thing?

318
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:25,900
理查德的妻子是艾米丽·斯宾塞，H.T.斯宾的女儿
Richard's wife was Emily Spencer,daughter of H.T. Spencer.

319
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:30,947
他建立了斯宾塞卡尔·迈克尔帝国，死干1905年
He founded the Spencer-Carmichael empire. He died in 1905.

320
01:04:31,155 --> 01:04:38,955
他是亿万富翁，他的遗嘱可能很有趣
He was a zillionaire.His will might be very interesting.

321
01:04:39,163 --> 01:04:44,293
我还会找一下有没有斯宾塞卡尔·迈克尔农场
I'll also try to find out if there was a Spencer-Carmichael ranch.

322
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:46,963
有口井农场
A ranch with a well.

323
01:04:52,259 --> 01:04:57,889
这是西雅图1908年的地图集，上面有卡尔迈克尔牧场
This is the 1908 atlas of Seattle showing the Carmichael ranch.

324
01:04:58,098 --> 01:05:01,434
那个小标记是什么
What is that little mark right there?

325
01:05:01,643 --> 01:05:06,773
根据图例，是水井所在地
According to the legend,it was the location of a well.

326
01:05:06,982 --> 01:05:11,987
在1914年的地图集中，在同样的地方开着...
In the 1914 atlas,which is opened to the same area...

327
01:05:12,195 --> 01:05:19,369
...财产没有什么改变，就像水井的地点
...the property is very much the same,as is the location of the well.

328
01:05:19,577 --> 01:05:25,750
在1928地图集上，随着财产的细分有了变动
In the 1928 atlas, there's a change,with subdivision of the property.

329
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:31,798
水井标志消失了，那里建起了房子
The well symbol has disappeared,and a house has been built here.

330
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:11,504
格雷女士 第13627街 西雅图 华盛顿
MRS. E. GREY 13627TH STREET, SEATTLE,WASH.

331
01:06:25,477 --> 01:06:28,438
牧场列在遗嘱上
The ranch is listed in the will.

332
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:34,277
他是5岁的约瑟夫的遗产的一部分。他什么都有
It’s part of five-year-old Joseph's inheritance. He got everything.

333
01:06:34,486 --> 01:06:37,948
他父亲昵
形同虚设
- What about the father?
- Bypassed.

334
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:41,284
只是不动产的监护人和管理者
Except as guardian and trustee of the estate.

335
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:46,998
这个老头的女儿死了，他不太喜欢女婿
The old man's daughter was dead, and he wasn't too fond of his son-in-law.

336
01:06:47,207 --> 01:06:51,169
是 但等等...理查德没有一分钱
Yes, but wait...Richard doesn't get any money.

337
01:06:51,378 --> 01:06:55,298
但是他仍然控制着儿子，他的儿子很值钱...
But he still controls his son and his son is worth a fortune...

338
01:06:55,507 --> 01:07:01,513
...除非这个男孩由干某种原因在21岁前死了
...unless for some reason the boy dies before attaining the age of21.

339
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:07,060
那么房产就归慈善机构而把理查德拒之门外
Then the estate goes to charity.That would have shut Richard out.

340
01:07:07,268 --> 01:07:11,814
与他一起的儿子体弱多病，卧床不起
And there he was with a son who was weak, sickly, bedridden...

341
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:19,280
他肯定决定不要在这个男孩身上下赌汪
He must have decided not to take a chance on the boy.

342
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,179
你要告诉她什么
关于井和男孩的事
- What are you going to tell her?
- About the well and the body.

343
01:07:44,388 --> 01:07:48,767
还有上有名字的纪念章
不 ，不是讲卡尔迈克尔的事
- And the medal with the name on it?
- No, and nothing about Carmichael.

344
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:53,397
她会以为你疯了的
你可以告诉她我没疯
- She'll think you're crazy.
- You'll tell her I’m not.

345
01:08:00,696 --> 01:08:05,451
晚上好，格雷女士，我是约翰·拉塞尔，这是诺曼小姐
Good evening, Mrs. Grey.I’m John Russell. This is Miss Norman.

346
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:16,337
我不该听你讲了两分钟故事
I wouldn't have listened to your story for two minutes.

347
01:08:16,545 --> 01:08:20,966
我不该让你进这里，如果不是你电话里说的
I wouldn't have let you in here, but for something you said on the phone.

348
01:08:21,175 --> 01:08:27,181
你说怪事发生在三天前
You said this seance affair happened three nights ago.

349
01:08:27,389 --> 01:08:32,561
三天前，在周一晚上....
Three nights ago,on Monday night...

350
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:39,735
...林达，我女儿刚过子夜，就醒来大喊大叫
...Linda, my daughter, woke up screaming just after midnight.

351
01:08:39,944 --> 01:08:45,074
她做了恶梦，我拥着她。她歇斯底里
She'd had a nightmare.I went in to her. She was hysterical.

352
01:08:45,282 --> 01:08:50,788
我以前从未见她那样，她做过恶梦，但不是...
I’d never seen her like that before.She's had nightmares, but not...

353
01:08:52,706 --> 01:09:00,339
她说 她看到一个男孩，非常小，非常瘦...
She said she'd seen a boy,very small, very thin...

354
01:09:00,547 --> 01:09:06,637
...简直像树精，他想从地板上钻上来
...almost gnome-like, and he was trying to come up through the floor.

355
01:09:06,845 --> 01:09:10,557
而且他一直盯着她
And he kept staring at her.

356
01:09:12,559 --> 01:09:15,813
在这，中间
Here, in the middle.

357
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:19,858
自从跟我睡一起就再没到过这房间
She hasn't been in the room since.She sleeps with me.

358
01:09:20,067 --> 01:09:22,235
我们想做的是...
What we want...

359
01:09:22,443 --> 01:09:26,698
你想把这间房子拆掉
What you want is to tear this room apart.

360
01:09:28,866 --> 01:09:33,121
我有你的电话号码，我得考虑一下
I have your phone number.I'll have to think about it.

361
01:11:52,217 --> 01:11:56,805
他们还在挖，但他们已经找那口井
They're still digging,but they've found the well.

362
01:11:57,014 --> 01:11:59,558
好
Okay.

363
01:12:04,062 --> 01:12:06,857
找到有东西吗
还没有
- Find anything?
- Not yet.

364
01:12:07,065 --> 01:12:11,862
这是托尼 格雷女士的儿子，诺曼女士
This is Tony, Mrs. Grey's son.Miss Norman.

365
01:12:18,952 --> 01:12:21,580
谢谢
Thanks.

366
01:12:41,683 --> 01:12:45,020
请把闪光灯绐我，好吗？
Get me the flashlight, will you?

367
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:48,065
我想我找到东西了
I think I’ve found something.

368
01:12:48,273 --> 01:12:50,901
是什么
What is it?

369
01:13:01,787 --> 01:13:04,873
是一只手
什么
- It’s a hand.
- What?

370
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:11,880
是只手
我去叫警察
- It’s a hand.
- I'll call the police.

371
01:13:19,888 --> 01:13:24,101
没有了
不像没有
- Nothing more?
- It doesn't look like it.

372
01:13:24,309 --> 01:13:27,938
可能有其它东西吗
没有
- Might there be something more?
- No.

373
01:13:28,146 --> 01:13:33,610
验尸官说骨头是很陈旧了，你知道那个孩子是谁
The coroner said the bones were old.Do you know who that child was?

374
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:37,447
不，真的不是
真的不是是什么意思？
- No, not really.
- What does "not really" mean?

375
01:13:38,824 --> 01:13:41,952
不
No.

376
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,789
我想每个人的陈词，你有住的地方吗
I want statements from everybody.Do you have somewhere else to stay?

377
01:13:46,998 --> 01:13:50,918
是的，都安排好了
Yes, it's all been arranged.

378
01:14:00,761 --> 01:14:04,890
我认为你本该告诉他们
必须这样
- I think you should have told them.
- It’s got to be there.

379
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:08,644
我们需要纪念章做证据
你有录音带
- We need that medal for evidence.
- You have the tape.

380
01:14:08,853 --> 01:14:12,523
录音带可以修改的，他们很清楚
Tapes can be altered.They know that.

381
01:14:12,732 --> 01:14:17,320
很朋显，你保留了一些东西
It was obvious you were holding something back.

382
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:23,242
很晚了，休息一下
好的，小心开车
- It’s late. Get some rest.
- Fine. Drive carefully.

383
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:24,756
什么事？
What's the matter?

384
01:17:29,844 --> 01:17:33,765
圣保罗教堂，1900年9月8日
St. Paul's Church.September8th, 1900.

385
01:17:33,974 --> 01:17:37,978
约瑟夫·帕特里克·卡尔迈克尔，它在那儿？
<i>Joseph Patrick Carmichael.It wasthere?</i>

386
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:41,439
它在那儿
It was there.

387
01:17:44,317 --> 01:17:49,114
你必须交绐警察，它是睢一的有力的证据
You have to show it to the police.It’s our only piece of solid evidence.

388
01:17:49,322 --> 01:17:55,912
他们没有看见我挖起它，他们为什么相信是那里挖的
They didn't see me dig it up.Why should they believe it was there?

389
01:17:56,121 --> 01:18:00,125
警察不会为一个79年的陈案，自寻烦恼
The police won't trouble themselves with a 70-year-old case.

390
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:03,253
它仍是一个悬而未决的谋杀
Still, it's an unsolved murder.

391
01:18:03,461 --> 01:18:08,883
要做的事必须由我去做，我必须去见卡尔迈克尔
Whatever is to be done, has to be done by me. I’ve got to get to Carmichael.

392
01:18:09,092 --> 01:18:13,012
他现在不会见你
他会见我的
- He won't see you now.
- He'll see me.

393
01:18:17,808 --> 01:18:21,103
议员
Senator.

394
01:18:21,312 --> 01:18:24,315
等等，议员
Hold up, Senator.

395
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:29,320
我是约翰·拉塞尔
I’m John Russell.

396
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:33,741
议员，看
我想给你看这个
Senator, look.
I want to show him that.

397
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:36,035
放开
Let go.

398
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:42,291
看这个，是金质纪念章，上面有你的名字
Look at this. It’s a baptism medal with your name on it.

399
01:18:42,499 --> 01:18:47,630
它与一个小男孩埋在一起
It was buried with the body of a little boy.

400
01:18:47,838 --> 01:18:50,883
警察知道了
The police know about it.

401
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:06,440
那个疯子是谁
我不知道，不要紧
- Who's that crackpot?
- I have no idea. Never mind.

402
01:19:11,403 --> 01:19:18,661
我要你无线电连接，警察总部德威特上尉
I want you to radio police headquarters. Captain DeWitt.

403
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:23,916
叫他打我斯泊坎的电话，这个号码
Ask him to call me at Spokane,this number.

404
01:20:12,715 --> 01:20:18,762
你这个婊子养的，你想要什么？
You goddamn son of a bitch.What is it you want?

405
01:20:20,347 --> 01:20:23,850
你想把我怎么样？
What do you want from me?

406
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:27,270
能做的事我都做了
I’ve done everything I could do.

407
01:20:29,188 --> 01:20:33,610
没有什么要做的
There's nothing more to do.

408
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:15,234
拉塞尔先生？
Mr. Russell?

409
01:21:15,443 --> 01:21:18,738
我叫德威特上尉
My name is Captain DeWitt.

410
01:21:18,947 --> 01:21:21,991
我想跟你谈谈
行
- I’d like to talk to you.
- All right.

411
01:21:29,582 --> 01:21:33,419
很安静的房子
是的
- Quite a house.
- Yes.

412
01:21:34,796 --> 01:21:39,300
你是作曲家
是的
- You're a composer.
- Yes.

413
01:21:39,509 --> 01:21:43,972
你在大学里教书
没错
- You teach at the university.
- That's right.

414
01:21:45,515 --> 01:21:51,980
这是你装神弄鬼的地方？
你想说什么？
- Is this where you held your seance?
- What do you want to talk about?

415
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:00,196
你闯入波音飞机的跑道，引起了轩然大波
You were out at Boeing airfield.You caused quite a scene.

416
01:22:00,405 --> 01:22:04,158
大喊，大叫，像个疯子
Screaming, yelling,acting like a lunatic.

417
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:09,455
我的警官说你昨晚也在做一些奇怪的事
My sergeant tells me you were up to some strange things last night, too.

418
01:22:09,664 --> 01:22:13,251
你在一位女士房子下挖上了一些骨头
You dug up some bones under a lady's house.

419
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:16,587
某些鬼魂的声音告诉骨头在那
Some ghostly voice told you they were there.

420
01:22:16,796 --> 01:22:23,094
德班警官说你告诉他你不知道骨头是谁
<i>Sergeant Durban said you told him you had no idea who those bones were. </i>

421
01:22:23,303 --> 01:22:27,849
那就有点奇怪了
It seems a little odd then...

422
01:22:28,057 --> 01:22:34,521
...那到处指控控诉议员
...that you go charging about,making accusations about the Senator.

423
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:39,192
一个为这个州服务了36年的人
A man who has served this state for36 years.

424
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:43,322
他不会向任何肮脏的敲诈计划屈服
He's not about to give in to any dirty little blackmail scheme.

425
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:47,701
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

426
01:22:50,454 --> 01:22:56,918
我理解你失去了妻子和女儿也许你不能释怀
I understand you lost your wife and daughter. Maybe it shook you up.

427
01:22:57,127 --> 01:23:02,132
也许你需要帮忙
我希望你现在离开这里
- Maybe you need help.
- I’d like you to leave now.

428
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:06,887
我们能替你搞定，你理解我说的话吗?
We can see that you get it.You understand what I’m saying?

429
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:10,891
出去,现在
听我说,拉塞尔
- Out, now.
- Listen to me, Russell.

430
01:23:12,476 --> 01:23:16,063
你有议员的东西，他想要回去
You've got something of the Senator's.He wants it back.

431
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:22,611
是块金纪念章,一个传家宝，他认为你拿了
It’s a gold medal. Afamily heirloom.He thinks you've got it.

432
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:29,201
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

433
01:23:32,371 --> 01:23:37,876
我很抱歉干涉你，但是我真他妈的疯了...
I’m sorry to barge in on you,but I am so damn mad...

434
01:23:38,085 --> 01:23:40,963
德威特上尉是警察局的
Capt. DeWitt is with the police.

435
01:23:41,171 --> 01:23:45,342
你是诺曼小姐?
是的
- You are Miss Norman?
- Yes.

436
01:23:48,387 --> 01:23:52,766
我一小时内带证据回来我会把这里砸碎
I'll be back in an hour with a warrant and we'll tear this place apart.

437
01:23:52,975 --> 01:23:58,981
怎么了
我会回来
- What's going on?
- I'll be here.

438
01:24:00,482 --> 01:24:03,694
随你便
Suit yourself.

439
01:24:06,113 --> 01:24:11,827
那是怎么回事?
议员认为这是敲诈
- What was that all about?
- The Senator thinks it's blackmail.

440
01:24:14,329 --> 01:24:20,502
他们退了你的租房，他们强迫我辞职
They've cancelled your lease.They've forced me to resign.

441
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:24,339
没有解释,只有离开
No explanation, just get out.

442
01:24:24,548 --> 01:24:29,886
我必须见董事长，我要知道我能做什么
I have to see the head of the Board of Directors. I'll find out what I can.

443
01:24:30,095 --> 01:24:33,515
我会打电话通知你
I'll call you and let you know.

444
01:26:00,559 --> 01:26:03,396
是的？是的，克菜尔
Yes? Yes, Claire.

445
01:26:03,604 --> 01:26:11,279
我认得这辆车，我不知道怎么会这样
I recognized the car.I don't know how it could've happened.

446
01:26:11,487 --> 01:26:20,162
车子在路中翻了个底朝天，警察死了
The car's upside down in the road and that policeman, he's dead!

447
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:04,456
有消息吗？
Any messages?

448
01:27:04,664 --> 01:27:08,168
德威特上尉？他说什么了？
Captain DeWitt? What did he say?

449
01:27:11,338 --> 01:27:14,507
什么？
What?

450
01:27:20,597 --> 01:27:22,933
噢 我的天！
Oh my God!

451
01:27:25,894 --> 01:27:28,563
谁？
Who?

452
01:27:28,772 --> 01:27:31,900
拉塞尔？
Russell?

453
01:27:33,568 --> 01:27:39,074
好的，我要那个号码
All right.Let me have that number.

454
01:27:55,257 --> 01:27:58,510
约翰·拉塞尔
议员想见你
- John Russell.
- The Senator is expecting you.

455
01:28:20,824 --> 01:28:22,867
还忙哪
是的
- Still busy?
- Yes.

456
01:28:33,295 --> 01:28:36,881
你去哪儿
我一会儿就回来
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back in a while.

457
01:28:48,852 --> 01:28:53,690
你到底想要什么
我肯定知道点
- What the hell do you want?
- You must have some idea.

458
01:28:53,898 --> 01:28:58,320
真的是他们让我进门的
我是大忙人。有话快说
- They did let me through the door.
- I’m a busy man. Make it fast.

459
01:29:02,949 --> 01:29:08,246
切斯曼公园的房子，1909年以前你家住那儿
The house on Chessman Park.Your family lived there until 1906.

460
01:29:10,623 --> 01:29:14,668
那里发生了一连串怪事
It’s had a history of strange happenings.

461
01:29:14,877 --> 01:29:18,714
那栋房子有东西，鬼魂现身
There's something in that house,a manifestation.

462
01:29:18,923 --> 01:29:25,638
今天下午德威特上尉来见我，是代表你吧
This afternoon, Capt. DeWitt came to see me, presumably on your behalf.

463
01:29:25,846 --> 01:29:30,059
他想必向你汇报了
He must have reported to you.

464
01:29:30,267 --> 01:29:36,941
骚扰，鬼魂现身，井里的尸骨
The disturbances, the seance,the bones found in the well.

465
01:29:38,901 --> 01:29:42,738
在机场我想跟你谈谈
I tried to talk to you at the airport.

466
01:29:42,947 --> 01:29:46,951
我给你看这个
I showed you this.

467
01:29:48,911 --> 01:29:52,456
德威特说你把它掉了
DeWitt said you'd lost it.

468
01:29:54,249 --> 01:29:59,213
我在埋那个孩子的墓里找到的
I found it in the grave where the child was buried.

469
01:30:02,883 --> 01:30:08,347
我现在跟你说的事，无法用逻辑来解释
There's no logical explanation for what I’m going to say to you now.

470
01:30:08,555 --> 01:30:11,725
那个男孩严重残疾
The boy was badly crippled.

471
01:30:11,934 --> 01:30:17,273
我认为他是在房子的阁楼被杀的
I believe he was killed in an attic room of that house.

472
01:30:17,481 --> 01:30:24,113
我看到了
I saw what happened.

473
01:30:26,657 --> 01:30:32,079
我认为是理查德·卡尔迈克尔，你父亲...
I believe it was Richard Carmichael,your father...

474
01:30:32,288 --> 01:30:38,586
...杀了小男孩，他的亲生儿子约瑟夫·卡尔迈克尔
...who murdered the boy,his natural son, Joseph Carmichael.

475
01:30:38,794 --> 01:30:44,758
替身来自一家孤儿院，后来去了欧洲
A substitution from the orphanage was made, and the boy went to Europe.

476
01:30:44,967 --> 01:30:51,181
他被奇迹般地治好了回来继承了帝国
He was cured, miraculously,and returned to inherit an empire.

477
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:54,560
那个矮小有丑陋的小孩成了你
That changeling was you.

478
01:31:07,573 --> 01:31:13,078
那就是你的故事
随你怎么说
- So, that's your story?
- Whatever you want to call it.

479
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:21,462
要多少？
我的天！
- How much?
- My God!

480
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:24,881
你在这里胡闹想要多少钱
How much do you want for this farce?

481
01:31:25,089 --> 01:31:29,385
这不是敲诈
我习惯了跟歹徒打交道
- This isn't blackmail.
- I’m used to dealing with vermin.

482
01:31:29,594 --> 01:31:35,808
你的故事很不可思议
它确实让你害怕
- Your story is so incredible...
- It truly terrifies you.

483
01:31:36,017 --> 01:31:41,648
这是事实，掩埋不了，这不关你事
It’s the truth. It won't be buried.None of this belongs to you!

484
01:31:41,856 --> 01:31:44,067
带着你的肮脏的谎言滚
Get out with your filthy lies.

485
01:31:44,275 --> 01:31:48,196
对那个孩子来说还没有完
It should've gone to that dead child.

486
01:31:48,404 --> 01:31:53,576
你不是约瑟夫·卡尔迈克尔，你是利益谋杀的受益者
You're not Joseph Carmichael. You're the beneficiary of murder for profit.

487
01:31:53,785 --> 01:31:56,996
不!
No!

488
01:31:57,205 --> 01:32:01,209
我父亲不是谋杀者
My father was not a murderer.

489
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:06,005
没有人可以这么说
Nobody in this world can say that.

490
01:32:06,214 --> 01:32:09,384
我父亲是好人
My father was a great man.

491
01:32:09,592 --> 01:32:12,512
他是个慈爱的人
He was a loving man.

492
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:17,016
而你来这里控告他...
For you to come in here and accuse him...

493
01:32:20,853 --> 01:32:24,440
...杀人
...of killing.

494
01:32:25,858 --> 01:32:28,820
混蛋
Damn you!

495
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:34,659
我不会允许你诽谤他的英名
I will not allow you to slander his good name.

496
01:32:44,502 --> 01:32:48,590
这些文件是市档案馆的
These documents are on file in the city.

497
01:32:50,133 --> 01:32:55,305
这是鬼魂现身的录音，没有拷贝
This is a tape of the seance.There's no copy.

498
01:32:57,390 --> 01:33:01,644
拿着吧，要做的我都做了
Take it.I’ve done what I had to do.

499
01:33:06,357 --> 01:33:08,985
对不起
I’m sorry.

500
01:33:09,902 --> 01:33:12,322
拉塞尔...
Russell...

501
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:20,121
如果我发现你把事情透露出去...
If I find that you've breathed one word of this to anyone...

502
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:24,959
...你会生不如死
...you'll wish you'd never come into this world.

503
01:33:46,438 --> 01:33:50,442
喊叫声是怎么回事
没什么
- What was all that shouting about?
- Nothing.

504
01:33:51,652 --> 01:33:54,738
出去。让我一个人在这里
Get out. Leave me alone.

505
01:34:40,075 --> 01:34:43,495
约翰？我打过电话
John? I tried to call...

506
01:34:52,087 --> 01:34:54,423
约翰？
John?

507
01:34:57,301 --> 01:35:00,470
你在哪儿？
