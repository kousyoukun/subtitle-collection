1
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,533
Where would we put
all that luggage?

2
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:54,244
Think about that.

3
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:57,414
- You're very strong.
- Okay, push!

4
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:00,834
This is the last holiday
I'm ever going on with you.

5
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,337
Where'd you get all those muscles?

6
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,505
- Come on.
- More, more, more!

7
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,174
- Don't quit now.
- How much further?

8
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:11,428
It's only a couple million more miles.

9
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:12,888
A couple of what?

10
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:16,516
Couple million more miles.
Right up here we're gonna stop.

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,352
Keep pushing. Don't quit.

12
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:22,064
- Mexico next time.
- Hawaii's better.

13
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:27,445
Hold it, hold it.
That's good.

14
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:38,455
- Now what you gonna do?
- I'm gonna try to get us some-

15
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:40,124
- Help?
- Help.

16
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,548
Come on.
Let's have a snowball fight.

17
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:53,471
Daddy! Daddy!

18
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,515
Come on!
Help me, Daddy!

19
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,657
Yes, do you have the number
for Emergency Road Service?

20
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:45,649
Thank you, Stan.

21
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:49,195
If you want a hand with anything,
just give me a shout, Mr. Russell.

22
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:50,863
I will, thanks.

23
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,160
Mr. Russell?

24
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,050
Catch.

25
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:12,405
You know that this piece
is going to Seattle too, Estancia?

26
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,074
Yes, sir.

27
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:16,910
Good.

28
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,094
At first, right after it happened,
I was in shock.

29
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:37,056
I just functioned automatically.
I didn't feel anything.

30
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,351
And one day, it hit me-

31
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,730
Joanna and Kathy are gone.

32
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:48,443
I just kept walking around the apartment
saying it over and over: "They're gone."

33
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:50,779
I guess I was about half crazy.

34
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:53,490
But that's over four months ago...

35
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:56,118
and what I've got to do now is
start making demands of myself.

36
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,161
Your first class is next Monday.

37
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:00,956
I'll set up a meeting tomorrow
with some of the faculty.

38
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,293
You'll remember a lot of them.
11:00 okay for you?

39
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:06,294
That's fine, Robert.
Thanks for everything you've done.

40
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:10,298
Come on. Everyone's very excited
about you being here.

41
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,802
A well-known alumnus and
distinguished composer like yourself.

42
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,555
Says who?

43
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:19,141
Distinguished or not,
we're glad you came.

44
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:21,685
Come on!
Give it to me!

45
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,230
- No!
- Okay, kids, keep it down.

46
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:27,483
Go into the kitchen,
get yourself some cookies.

47
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:32,155
By the way, how long are you
planning to stay in that hotel?

48
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:34,866
- There's plenty of room here.
- No, thanks, Eva.

49
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,995
I think I'm gonna find a house to rent.
I've got some things coming out.

50
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:42,498
I need a place I can lock myself in
and pound away at the piano all night.

51
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:46,920
I have a friend who works for
the Historical Preservation Society.

52
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:49,339
They have some old houses
that I'm sure they rent.

53
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:52,509
- We'll see what we can come up with.
- Good.

54
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,157
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes.

55
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:19,120
Hello, I'm Claire Norman.
Why don't you hop in and we'll drive up.

56
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:20,621
Fine.

57
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,373
- When was the house last occupied?
- Let's see.

58
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:05,876
About 12 years ago.
It's been with the Historical Society...

59
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,920
for the past 12 years.

60
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,675
There we go.

61
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,936
Wow.

62
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:26,898
There were plans at one time to
turn it into some kind of a museum.

63
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:32,029
But I don't know. I guess
a house was meant to be lived in.

64
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,074
Why hasn't it been lived in?

65
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,034
I've only been with the Society
for a year now.

66
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:42,372
The impression I get is they haven't
tried very hard with this place.

67
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,374
Of course,
it does need a lot of work.

68
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,335
Yeah.

69
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:50,840
There's some pieces here
that are just stored.

70
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,218
You'd have your pick of them.
You know, whatever you'd like.

71
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,681
Kitchen's in here.

72
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,184
What does it take to maintain
a house of this size?

73
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,479
We have a man
who looks after all these places.

74
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,147
Mr. Tuttle.

75
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,483
And...

76
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,155
this is the music room.

77
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,283
This is really why
I thought of you and this house.

78
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,163
The piano was left here
when the Society took over.

79
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,790
Just too much trouble
to move, really.

80
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,918
It must be in very bad shape.

81
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,715
What are the terms?

82
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,869
Sorry to disturb your composing.

83
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:43,164
That's all right, Mr. Tuttle.
This has already been composed.

84
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:47,126
There's a man in front wanting
to deliver a water storage tank.

85
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,753
Oh, okay.

86
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:13,362
Have you managed
to do any writing?

87
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,657
I'm still working on the second
movement. Same old problem.

88
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,202
Well, maybe the lectures will help,
get some new ideas going.

89
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,432
It's my understanding...

90
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:45,603
that there are...

91
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:47,605
twenty-three students registered...

92
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:54,237
for this series of lectures
on advanced musical form.

93
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,782
Now, we all know that
it's not raining outside.

94
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:02,496
Unless there's a fire in some other part
of the building we don't know about...

95
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,083
there's an awful lot of people here
with nothing better to do.

96
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,878
However...

97
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:13,507
we'll know more
after the second lecture.

98
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,553
I'm sure there are many of you...

99
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:19,555
who may recognize this.

100
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,092
Sounds a little bit better
with an orchestra than a piano.

101
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:57,428
No, you made it sound fine.
That was a great class.

102
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:59,764
John's secret is
that he's a natural ham.

103
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:01,933
Don't go too far.
Excuse me.

104
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:05,353
- If you can't find your way back-
- I'll send out a search party.

105
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:17,907
Hi. I'd like you
to meet my mother.

106
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,951
- How do you do, Mrs. Norman?
- How do you do?

107
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,079
This is John Russell.
You remember the Chessman house?

108
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,001
Oh, yes. I'm very pleased
to meet you, Mr. Russell.

109
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:30,921
- How are you liking the place?
- Fine.

110
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:34,425
- It's so large.
- Yes.

111
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:38,094
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

112
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:42,224
I'd like to introduce
Senator Joseph Carmichael-

113
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,644
My God.
He's going to make another speech.

114
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:49,607
What you're hearing is a lifelong
Republican commenting on a Democrat.

115
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:54,111
You know how I hate making speeches.

116
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:58,074
But sometimes,
on a very special occasion...

117
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:01,828
like raising money for
our magnificent symphony orchestra-

118
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,205
And weren't they fantastic tonight?

119
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,542
Damn right.

120
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:12,296
- I was just going to get a drink.
- I think I'll join you.

121
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:15,133
I'll be right back, Mother.

122
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,844
Thank you.

123
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,684
Thank you. Actually,
he's on our board of directors...

124
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,978
at the Historical Preservation Society.

125
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,313
In fact, he's become
our number one philanthropist.

126
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,902
- So, you're getting settled in then?
- Oh, yes.

127
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:36,739
There's some things at the Society
office that belong to your house.

128
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:39,241
I'll see if I can
dig them up for you.

129
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,243
I'm glad you took the house.

130
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,181
Mr. Tuttle?

131
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:49,229
Yes, Mr. Russell?

132
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,191
You frightened me.

133
00:18:52,274 --> 00:18:56,612
Is anyone else here?
Mrs. Rissean cleaning today?

134
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:58,864
No, sir, just me.

135
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:00,825
Thank you.

136
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:42,262
That's lovely- the music.

137
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,848
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

138
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:48,978
- Has the quality of a lullaby.
- Yes, it is in a sort.

139
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,023
Well, here we are, as promised.

140
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:57,028
These are some assorted prints that
used to hang in the house somewhere.

141
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:58,988
And this...

142
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,576
is an old restored photograph
taken at the front of the house.

143
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:05,245
- Isn't that remarkable?
- Beautiful.

144
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:11,501
I tried to call first, but Information
isn't giving your number out yet.

145
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:17,048
That's a beautiful old piece.
Did you refinish it?

146
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,800
I didn't, no.

147
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:25,057
Um, that was Kathy's,
my daughter.

148
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:36,277
Well, I guess I'd better be off.

149
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,320
I hope you like the prints.

150
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:39,989
Thank you.

151
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,076
You going riding?

152
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,996
Yes. Do you ride?

153
00:22:33,128 --> 00:22:34,504
What's the matter?

154
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,091
I was just thinking
about my daughter, Kathy-

155
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:43,429
how much she loved horses.

156
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:27,183
An air lock somewhere.

157
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:29,436
It was too loud, too rhythmic.

158
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:35,108
Well, it's starting, at least.

159
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:40,029
Why would it happen
two mornings in a row...

160
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:42,031
precisely at 6:00?

161
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:46,578
Why does it go on for half a minute
and then stop? It doesn't make sense.

162
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:51,583
A furnace is like anything else,
Mr. Russell.

163
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,794
It's got habits.

164
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,463
It's an old house.

165
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:58,299
It makes noises.

166
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:22,866
Well, very good.

167
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:26,161
We're still not together
on the off-beats...

168
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:30,832
and, darling, you're retarding
a little too much on the last four bars.

169
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,210
Otherwise, it was splendid.

170
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,422
- Good night.
- Good night.

171
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:38,090
See you tomorrow.

172
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,918
What I'm driving at is...

173
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:58,297
has anything like this
happened in the house before?

174
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,968
If so, to whom, when,
and what did they do about it?

175
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:06,722
Since I've been with the Society,
the house has been empty.

176
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:10,100
John, you're working very hard.

177
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,853
You've been through
a terrible emotional strain.

178
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:15,731
- Are you saying I'm hallucinating?
- Excuse me.

179
00:28:15,814 --> 00:28:17,107
Minnie?

180
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,693
Claire, there's a call for you-
your mother.

181
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:22,613
- Should I tell her you're busy?
- I'll be right there.

182
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:24,615
Excuse me just for a minute.

183
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:36,169
You know there's some question
about your lease, Mr. Russell.

184
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:40,173
- What do you mean?
- That house shouldn't have been rented.

185
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:44,385
Miss Norman rushed those papers
through our attorney's office.

186
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,556
She did not use proper channels.

187
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:49,850
Why should anyone object?

188
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:53,854
That house is not fit to live in.

189
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:58,234
No one's been able to live in it.

190
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:02,363
It doesn't want people.

191
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:05,533
Then there has been trouble
in the house before?

192
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:48,844
Listen, it's note for note.
Same tempo, even the same key.

193
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:51,013
What do you think?

194
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:54,893
I don't know.
It's a startling coincidence.

195
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:59,147
But that melody must have been
very popular at one time...

196
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:01,108
or it wouldn't be
on the music box.

197
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:04,361
I agree,
but I swear I never heard it...

198
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:07,781
before I played it and recorded it
that day you came over.

199
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:10,950
There's something-
Something.

200
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,453
It's happened before here.
I'm not the first.

201
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:16,748
I went over the files
very carefully...

202
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:19,501
all the way back to 1920.

203
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:23,589
- Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Miss Huxley.

204
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:28,094
Minnie's a highly eccentric
old woman, but she'd never-

205
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:30,847
She said the house didn't want people.
She's mistaken.

206
00:37:30,888 --> 00:37:35,185
Whatever it is is trying
desperately to communicate.

207
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:38,104
The bangings, the water taps,
the broken window panes.

208
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:40,982
All the glass fell outward.
It had to be done from the inside.

209
00:37:41,065 --> 00:37:43,651
Everything that's happened
has been designed...

210
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:45,528
to get me into that attic room.

211
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,741
I want to see it.

212
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,260
Look at that book
on the desk there.

213
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:22,108
"C.S.B. January 4, 1909."

214
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:27,071
It's a little child's writing.

215
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:29,782
1909.
Who could've lived here then?

216
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:36,415
That's where I found the music box,
on the mantle.

217
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:44,130
Look at this wheelchair.

218
00:38:45,298 --> 00:38:47,342
Oh, my God.

219
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:51,596
It's so small.

220
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:56,477
What was this room?

221
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:35,934
Former residents:
William Sarachino and family. Architect.

222
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:39,438
Bought the place in 1965.
Sold it in 1967.

223
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:42,440
Purchased from the Society
for Historical Preservation...

224
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:46,027
November, 1967, through a generous
grant from the Carmichael Foundation.

225
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:47,738
- That's the senator?
- Yeah.

226
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,034
- Great philanthropist.
- Where is the rest of this file?

227
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:54,620
Previous occupants-

228
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:56,747
No previous occupants listed.

229
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:59,500
There's nothing here before 1920.

230
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:04,505
Minnie, we're looking for
the Chessman house file, pre-1920.

231
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:07,550
- Do you know where it is?
- What is it you want to know?

232
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:10,303
We're trying to find out
who lived in the house in 1909.

233
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,476
A man named Barnard.
A doctor.

234
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,439
- Did he have any children?
- I believe a son and a daughter.

235
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:24,359
There was some kind
of family tragedy, I think.

236
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:27,487
He sold the house in 1909.

237
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:30,073
1909? I'll set it up for you.

238
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:31,742
Fine.

239
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:36,080
It's all ready to go.
The scanner's on the right.

240
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:38,082
Thank you so much.

241
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:44,004
Let's have a look here.

242
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,381
February 9.
These are want ads.

243
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:49,552
Financial page.

244
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:52,346
Real estate.
More want ads.

245
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:58,728
Wait, wait, wait.

246
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:06,653
"Cora Barnard, seven-year-old daughter
of Dr. Walter Barnard...

247
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:09,698
prominent Seattle physician,
was struck and seriously injured...

248
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:12,408
when she ran in front
of a passing coal cart...

249
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:14,744
outside her Chessman Park home
yesterday.

250
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,788
She was hastened to
St. Margaret's Hospital...

251
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:18,581
where her condition remains grave."

252
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:22,252
- So forth and so on.
- Cora Barnard.

253
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:24,212
C.S.B.

254
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:33,264
There.

255
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:39,145
"Cora Barnard, daughter of-

256
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:42,564
succumbed in
St. Margaret's Hospital...

257
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:45,359
to injuries sustained in
a February 15 accident.

258
00:41:45,442 --> 00:41:47,278
She is mourned by her parents.

259
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:50,114
Miss Barnard will be interred
in the family plot...

260
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:52,450
in the Brookfield Cemetery."

261
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:57,664
There's the doctor...

262
00:41:57,747 --> 00:42:00,250
and his wife.

263
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,294
There's the brother, Lloyd.

264
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,638
This little girl, Cora...

265
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:17,309
was killed in the street.

266
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:20,062
It was an accident,
almost the same as Kathy.

267
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:30,031
What is it
in that house, Claire?

268
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:33,326
What is it doing?
Why is it trying to reach me?

269
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:36,162
- John-
- Is it because of my daughter?

270
00:42:39,207 --> 00:42:41,126
I can't go through all this again.

271
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:46,172
You must get out of that house.

272
00:45:09,446 --> 00:45:12,157
I believe everything you're saying,
Mr. Russell.

273
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,825
The noises, the lights,
the teleportation of objects-

274
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:16,661
all very familiar.

275
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:19,455
- Fascinating stuff.
- But the point is...

276
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:22,333
what do I do now?

277
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,461
I tell you, off the record.

278
00:45:24,544 --> 00:45:27,047
We have coming here...

279
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,009
many mediums
and spiritualists and so.

280
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:33,345
We test them.

281
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:37,308
Ninety-nine percent are the frauds.

282
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:41,270
But the one percent-

283
00:45:41,354 --> 00:45:43,146
astonishing.

284
00:45:44,189 --> 00:45:46,316
A medium.

285
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:14,887
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes.

286
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:16,264
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

287
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:18,349
- My wife, Leah.
- Come in, please.

288
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:20,435
- Thank you.
- It's just to your left.

289
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,691
Could we have
these lights off, please?

290
00:46:25,774 --> 00:46:27,359
Sure.

291
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,670
I thought I'd record what happens.

292
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:48,672
- Is that all right?
- Yes, of course.

293
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:54,303
That's fine. Mr. Russell,
would you sit there, please?

294
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:57,098
I'll sit here.
Thank you.

295
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:51,654
You've suffered a cruel loss,
John Russell.

296
00:47:52,572 --> 00:47:54,950
You've lost a wife and child.

297
00:47:57,035 --> 00:48:01,290
The presence in this house is reaching
out to you through that loss.

298
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:09,674
The presence is very strong here.

299
00:48:16,722 --> 00:48:19,600
It is a child's presence...

300
00:48:19,683 --> 00:48:21,977
a child who is not at peace...

301
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:25,356
who cannot rest.

302
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:33,531
The presence is with us.

303
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:38,995
We sense that you are with us.

304
00:48:40,372 --> 00:48:42,291
Will you talk to us?

305
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:48,338
Will you communicate with us?

306
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:52,467
Will you come through to us?

307
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,351
Will you speak to us?

308
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,027
We are here to help you.

309
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:15,574
What is your name?

310
00:49:18,244 --> 00:49:20,037
Will you speak to us?

311
00:49:22,498 --> 00:49:24,042
Yes.

312
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,922
What is your name?

313
00:49:30,715 --> 00:49:33,009
Are you the child Cora?

314
00:49:35,137 --> 00:49:40,017
Are you the child killed
by the coal cart?

315
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:46,773
What is your name?

316
00:49:56,158 --> 00:49:57,284
Joseph.

317
00:49:58,994 --> 00:50:02,915
Did you die in this house, Joseph?

318
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,919
How did you die?

319
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:14,135
Is there someone here
you wish to communicate with?

320
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,148
Help. Help. Help.

321
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,875
Mr. Russell,
will you sit over here now, please?

322
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,682
Will you speak to John?

323
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:07,983
Will you tell us
why you are not at rest?

324
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:13,529
Speak to John.

325
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,701
John is with us.

326
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,877
What do you want of John?

327
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:32,424
Why do you feel no peace?

328
00:51:41,392 --> 00:51:44,561
Why do you remain
in this house, Joseph?

329
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,357
What is in this house?

330
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:52,653
Speak to John.

331
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:56,950
John is with us.

332
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:01,204
How did you die?

333
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,999
Did you die in this house?

334
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:09,922
Why do you remain in this house?

335
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:13,675
How did you die?

336
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,013
Joseph, did you die in this house?

337
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,336
We are here to help you.

338
00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:35,135
What is your name?

339
00:53:39,931 --> 00:53:42,351
...killed by the coal cart?

340
00:53:56,907 --> 00:54:00,828
Are you the child
killed by the coal cart?

341
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:23,559
We are here to help you.

342
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,605
What is your name?

343
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,650
Joseph.

344
00:54:59,972 --> 00:55:02,725
Did you die in this house, Joseph?

345
00:55:02,808 --> 00:55:04,394
House.

346
00:55:07,105 --> 00:55:09,774
My room.

347
00:55:09,858 --> 00:55:11,443
Can't walk.

348
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:19,951
Will you tell us
why you are not at rest?

349
00:55:20,034 --> 00:55:21,619
My father.

350
00:55:21,703 --> 00:55:24,372
Joseph, did you die in this house?

351
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:28,084
- My room.
- How did you die?

352
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:36,010
Father.

353
00:55:38,846 --> 00:55:41,015
The well.

354
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:43,684
Ranch.

355
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:46,436
Sacred Heart.

356
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,273
My medal.

357
00:55:51,442 --> 00:55:54,320
Father, don't.

358
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:55,613
Help.

359
00:56:40,702 --> 00:56:44,456
Body. Ranch.

360
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,123
The well.

361
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:53,673
My name- Joseph Carmichael.

362
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:05,914
Yeah.

363
00:58:05,998 --> 00:58:07,583
I'm sorry to-

364
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:14,549
I just-
Can you come-

365
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:40,158
Will you tell us
why you are not at rest?

366
00:58:41,034 --> 00:58:45,496
- My father.
- Joseph, did you die in this house?

367
00:58:45,538 --> 00:58:49,250
- My room.
- How did you die?

368
00:58:49,334 --> 00:58:52,003
Father, don't.

369
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,366
I shouldn't have called you.
It's just that I needed someone.

370
00:59:26,998 --> 00:59:29,918
I wrote some words on the paper.

371
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,464
I wrote "Sacred Heart."

372
00:59:40,345 --> 00:59:43,140
There used to be
a county orphanage...

373
00:59:43,224 --> 00:59:46,017
named Sacred Heart.

374
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:48,645
It was closed down years ago.

375
00:59:50,397 --> 00:59:51,982
What?

376
00:59:59,448 --> 01:00:02,118
Their child, Joseph Carmichael.

377
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:08,082
He was murdered in this house
in the attic...

378
01:00:08,124 --> 01:00:10,919
and buried.

379
01:00:11,002 --> 01:00:12,754
And then an orphan-

380
01:00:12,796 --> 01:00:17,258
Stop it, John,
just for one minute, please!

381
01:01:09,354 --> 01:01:13,066
Miss Huxley's on the phone, Senator.
It's the third time this morning.

382
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,860
- She says it's important.
- All right, I'll take it.

383
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:29,333
Hello, Minnie. How are you?

384
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:31,335
I'm fine.

385
01:01:32,544 --> 01:01:35,005
They've been
going through the files.

386
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:38,885
Let me have that name again.

387
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:48,811
I'm very glad to be of help,
as you know.

388
01:01:50,855 --> 01:01:52,106
Good-bye.

389
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,948
This is the senator's
campaign bio, 1960.

390
01:02:40,031 --> 01:02:43,118
I got it from the main library,
had them Xerox it for me.

391
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:46,787
- You found something?
- It's a kind of rough retrospective...

392
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:50,208
somebody drew up when they were thinking
of turning the house into a museum.

393
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:55,588
Richard Carmichael and family
occupied the house 1899 to 1906.

394
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:58,800
Richard was the senator's father.

395
01:02:58,884 --> 01:03:01,595
His mother died
when he was born in 1900.

396
01:03:01,636 --> 01:03:03,931
It's all in there.

397
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:05,933
Look at the part
about his illness.

398
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:12,565
"Joe Carmichael, their son, at age three
was struck down by atrophic arthritis-"

399
01:03:12,648 --> 01:03:14,609
A little further down.

400
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:18,111
"It was decided to send little Joe
to the famed Nordbach Sanatorium...

401
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:20,239
in Basel, Switzerland,
for special therapy.

402
01:03:20,322 --> 01:03:24,577
Accompanied by his father, he embarked
for Europe in October, 1906...

403
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:29,790
not to set foot on American soil again
until the cessation of World War I."

404
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:32,627
See how it might have been done?

405
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,629
Richard's son, a sick child...

406
01:03:34,712 --> 01:03:37,966
was murdered by his father
and buried secretly.

407
01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:42,012
Then the substitute,
a six-year-old orphan...

408
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:44,556
was put in his place,
shipped right overseas right away...

409
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,767
with the father attending-
it all worked for them.

410
01:03:47,809 --> 01:03:51,730
Even the war worked. It kept him
in Switzerland till 1918.

411
01:03:51,813 --> 01:03:53,982
He came back here,
he was 18 years old.

412
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:56,777
Who was gonna know
he wasn't the real son?

413
01:03:56,818 --> 01:03:59,321
If he wasn't crippled anymore,
it was because he was cured.

414
01:04:01,323 --> 01:04:05,411
Do you think he knows about
the murder and the replacement?

415
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:07,246
I don't know.

416
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:10,249
How could any father
do such a thing?

417
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:15,879
Richard's wife was Emily Spencer,
the daughter of H.T. Spencer...

418
01:04:15,963 --> 01:04:19,174
who founded
the Spencer Carmichael empire.

419
01:04:19,216 --> 01:04:24,180
He died in 1905.
He was a zillionaire. His will-

420
01:04:24,222 --> 01:04:26,432
his will might be very interesting.

421
01:04:26,516 --> 01:04:29,102
There must be a copy of it
in the hall of records.

422
01:04:29,185 --> 01:04:33,565
I'm also going to find out if there was
a Spencer or Carmichael ranch somewhere.

423
01:04:34,524 --> 01:04:37,110
Yeah- a ranch with a well.

424
01:04:42,366 --> 01:04:44,702
This is the 1908 atlas of Seattle...

425
01:04:44,743 --> 01:04:47,954
which is open to the part of the city
where the Carmichael ranch was located.

426
01:04:48,038 --> 01:04:49,998
- Right here.
- What does that little mark there mean?

427
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:56,046
According to the legend here, that was
the location of a well on the property.

428
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,883
- I see.
- And in the 1914 atlas...

429
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:02,094
which is opened here
to the same area...

430
01:05:02,178 --> 01:05:05,681
there's been one large lot
that's apparently been sold off...

431
01:05:05,765 --> 01:05:08,851
but the property is very much the same,
and the well's still there.

432
01:05:08,935 --> 01:05:13,398
- Right. Exactly.
- The 1928 atlas was quite a change.

433
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:15,859
There's further subdivision
of the property.

434
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:18,361
The symbol for the well has
disappeared...

435
01:05:18,402 --> 01:05:20,863
and a house has been built here.

436
01:06:15,587 --> 01:06:18,464
The ranch is listed in the will...

437
01:06:18,548 --> 01:06:22,510
part of the inheritance of little Joseph
Carmichael, all of five years old.

438
01:06:22,594 --> 01:06:24,471
He got just about everything.

439
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,975
- What about the father, Richard?
- Bypassed...

440
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:31,437
except as his son's guardian,
and therefore trustee of the estate.

441
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:33,981
Well, old man Spencer's daughter
was dead...

442
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,400
and, obviously, he wasn't
too fond of his son-in-law.

443
01:06:37,818 --> 01:06:40,988
Yes, but wait.
Richard doesn't get any money...

444
01:06:41,072 --> 01:06:45,243
but he still controls his son,
and his son is worth a fortune...

445
01:06:45,326 --> 01:06:47,161
unless-

446
01:06:47,202 --> 01:06:51,582
unless, for some reason, the boy dies
before attaining the age of 21.

447
01:06:51,665 --> 01:06:54,126
In that case,
the entire estate goes to charity.

448
01:06:55,169 --> 01:06:57,004
That would have shut Richard out
completely...

449
01:06:57,088 --> 01:06:58,965
and there he was
with a son who was...

450
01:06:59,007 --> 01:07:01,843
weak, sickly, bedridden-
couldn't even walk.

451
01:07:03,303 --> 01:07:06,598
He must have decided
not to take a chance on the boy.

452
01:07:06,681 --> 01:07:09,476
The money was just too tempting.

453
01:07:29,914 --> 01:07:31,540
What are you gonna tell her?

454
01:07:31,624 --> 01:07:34,335
About the well under the house
and the body.

455
01:07:34,377 --> 01:07:37,672
- And the medal with the name on it?
- No. Nothing about Carmichael.

456
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:42,385
- She'll think you're crazy.
- You'll tell her I'm not.

457
01:07:50,726 --> 01:07:52,770
Good evening, Mrs. Grey.
I'm John Russell.

458
01:07:52,854 --> 01:07:54,272
This is Miss Norman.

459
01:08:01,988 --> 01:08:06,285
Mr. Russell, I wouldn't have listened
to your story for two minutes...

460
01:08:06,368 --> 01:08:09,997
I wouldn't have let you in here
but for something you said on the phone.

461
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:15,920
You said this seance affair of yours
happened three nights ago.

462
01:08:15,962 --> 01:08:17,254
- Right?
- That's right.

463
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:22,509
Well, three nights ago,
on Monday night...

464
01:08:22,593 --> 01:08:27,598
Linda, my daughter,
woke up screaming...

465
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:29,934
just after midnight.

466
01:08:29,976 --> 01:08:31,936
She'd had a nightmare.

467
01:08:31,978 --> 01:08:35,190
When I went in to her,
she was hysterical, she was sobbing.

468
01:08:35,273 --> 01:08:37,734
I'd never seen her like that before.

469
01:08:37,776 --> 01:08:40,320
Oh, I mean, she'd had nightmares
before, but not-

470
01:08:42,948 --> 01:08:46,701
She said she'd seen a boy-

471
01:08:46,784 --> 01:08:50,413
very small, very thin...

472
01:08:50,455 --> 01:08:52,415
almost gnomelike-

473
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:55,794
and he was trying to come up
through the floor.

474
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:00,007
He kept staring at her.

475
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,678
Here, in the middle.

476
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:09,976
She hasn't been in this room since,
won't come near it. She sleeps with me.

477
01:09:10,017 --> 01:09:12,103
What we want, is-

478
01:09:12,186 --> 01:09:15,440
What you want, Mr. Russell,
is to tear this room apart.

479
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:21,779
Well, I have your phone number.
I'll have to think about it.

480
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,239
What the hell's going on?
Linda!

481
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,385
They're still digging...

482
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:46,888
but they found the well.

483
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,389
Okay.

484
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,731
- Did you find anything?
- No, nothing yet.

485
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,692
This is Tony, Mrs. Grey's son.
Miss Norman.

486
01:11:59,776 --> 01:12:01,194
- Hello.
- Hi.

487
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:10,329
Thanks.

488
01:12:31,684 --> 01:12:34,270
- Gimme that flashlight, will you?
- Sure.

489
01:12:34,353 --> 01:12:36,105
I think I found something.

490
01:12:37,607 --> 01:12:39,025
What is it?

491
01:12:51,704 --> 01:12:53,623
It's a hand.

492
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:54,958
What?

493
01:12:57,168 --> 01:12:58,795
It's a hand.

494
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,048
I'll call the police.

495
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:12,101
Nothing more?

496
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:13,894
Doesn't look like it.

497
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:15,938
You think there might be
something else down there?

498
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:21,652
Assistant coroner said those bones
had been down there maybe 50 years.

499
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:23,654
Do you have some idea
who that child was?

500
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:25,698
No, not really.

501
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,575
What's "not really" mean?

502
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:34,540
I'm gonna want
statements from everybody.

503
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:36,918
Mrs. Grey, do you have some other
place you could stay for tonight?

504
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,421
- Yes, it's all been arranged.
- Good.

505
01:13:50,849 --> 01:13:52,767
I think you should have told them.

506
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:54,853
It's gotta be there.

507
01:13:54,936 --> 01:13:56,938
Without that medal,
there's no evidence, there's nothing.

508
01:13:57,022 --> 01:14:00,484
- You have the tape.
- Tapes can be altered.

509
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:02,611
They know that.
Did you see the expression on his face?

510
01:14:03,445 --> 01:14:05,406
It was obvious you were
holding something back.

511
01:14:05,447 --> 01:14:06,949
I'll say.

512
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:11,120
Look, it's very late. Get some rest,
and I'll talk to you in the morning.

513
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:13,456
- Fine. Drive careful.
- You too.

514
01:17:11,473 --> 01:17:12,724
What's the matter?

515
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:23,902
"St. Paul's Church
September 8, 1900...

516
01:17:23,985 --> 01:17:26,113
Joseph Patrick Carmichael."

517
01:17:26,864 --> 01:17:28,157
It was there.

518
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,075
It was there.

519
01:17:33,746 --> 01:17:39,210
You have to show it to the police.
It's the only piece of solid evidence.

520
01:17:39,293 --> 01:17:42,797
They didn't find it or see me dig it up.
Why should they believe it was there?

521
01:17:42,839 --> 01:17:44,632
You can't just ignore them.

522
01:17:46,134 --> 01:17:49,387
The police aren't going to trouble
themselves with a 70-year-old case.

523
01:17:50,221 --> 01:17:53,307
- Still, it's an unsolved murder.
- Nah.

524
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:56,269
Whatever's to be done
has to be done by me.

525
01:17:56,352 --> 01:17:58,938
I've got to get to Carmichael.

526
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:00,857
- He won't see you now.
- He'll see me.

527
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:10,159
Senator!

528
01:18:10,242 --> 01:18:13,454
- Hey, hold it right there! Hold up.
- Mr. Carmichael! Senator-

529
01:18:13,537 --> 01:18:15,831
- Wait a minute, now.
- Get the hell out of my way.

530
01:18:15,873 --> 01:18:17,667
Senator, I'm John Russell.

531
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:21,128
I'm living in your house.
Senator, look.

532
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:24,882
I want to show him that.
I want to talk to him. Let me go!

533
01:18:24,923 --> 01:18:26,300
Senator!

534
01:18:26,383 --> 01:18:27,843
Look at this medal.

535
01:18:27,927 --> 01:18:29,887
It's a baptism medal.

536
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:31,597
- It's got your name on it.
- You got him?

537
01:18:31,681 --> 01:18:33,683
- We got him.
- It was buried with the body.

538
01:18:35,727 --> 01:18:37,896
A little boy.

539
01:18:38,938 --> 01:18:41,066
The police know about it.

540
01:18:50,283 --> 01:18:52,744
Who was that?
Some kind of crackpot?

541
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:56,665
I've no idea.
Never mind. Come on.

542
01:19:01,712 --> 01:19:07,384
Dale, I want you to radio back
to police headquarters...

543
01:19:07,426 --> 01:19:09,679
Captain DeWitt.

544
01:19:09,762 --> 01:19:13,391
Ask him to call me in Spokane
at this number.

545
01:19:13,433 --> 01:19:15,059
Yes, sir.

546
01:20:03,317 --> 01:20:05,736
You goddamn son of a bitch.

547
01:20:07,071 --> 01:20:08,990
What is it you want?

548
01:20:10,617 --> 01:20:12,619
What do you want from me?

549
01:20:14,162 --> 01:20:16,540
I've done everything I can do!

550
01:20:19,917 --> 01:20:21,836
There's nothing more to do.

551
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:05,423
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes?

552
01:21:05,506 --> 01:21:08,885
- My name is DeWitt, Captain DeWitt.
- Oh, yes.

553
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:12,138
- I'd like to talk to you if I may.
- All right. Come in.

554
01:21:19,812 --> 01:21:22,232
- Quite a house.
- Yes.

555
01:21:25,026 --> 01:21:28,363
You're a musician, a composer-
is that right, Mr. Russell?

556
01:21:28,405 --> 01:21:29,531
Yes.

557
01:21:29,573 --> 01:21:32,659
You're teaching a course at the faculty
of music out of the university?

558
01:21:32,743 --> 01:21:34,203
That's right.

559
01:21:35,746 --> 01:21:38,499
Is this where you held your seance?

560
01:21:38,582 --> 01:21:41,085
What was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

561
01:21:45,632 --> 01:21:48,426
You were out at Boeing Airfield
this morning, Mr. Russell.

562
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:50,427
They tell me you caused
quite a scene-

563
01:21:50,469 --> 01:21:53,431
screaming, yelling,
acting like a lunatic.

564
01:21:54,473 --> 01:21:58,770
Sergeant Durban tells me you were up to
some strange things last night too.

565
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:02,690
Seems you dug up some bones
under a lady's house...

566
01:22:02,774 --> 01:22:06,695
that some ghostly voice told you
were there, is that correct?

567
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:10,991
Only Sergeant Durban said
you told him you had no idea...

568
01:22:11,074 --> 01:22:13,285
who those bones were-
no idea at all.

569
01:22:13,368 --> 01:22:18,457
Now, it seems a little odd, then,
don't you think...

570
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:20,875
that you'd go charging across
that airfield this morning...

571
01:22:20,959 --> 01:22:23,754
making crazy accusations
against Senator Carmichael?

572
01:22:23,795 --> 01:22:27,132
- I made no accusations.
- The senator has served this state...

573
01:22:27,216 --> 01:22:29,551
- for 36 years and is not about to...
- I told you-

574
01:22:29,635 --> 01:22:32,805
- give in to a dirty blackmail scheme.
- Blackmail?

575
01:22:32,888 --> 01:22:34,807
- You heard me.
- What are you talking about?

576
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:43,775
I understand you lost your wife
and daughter a little while ago.

577
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:47,153
Maybe it shook you up-
maybe too much.

578
01:22:47,237 --> 01:22:49,447
Maybe you need help.

579
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:53,910
- I'd like you to leave now.
- We can see that you get it.

580
01:22:55,662 --> 01:22:57,914
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Out, now.

581
01:22:57,997 --> 01:22:59,416
Listen to me, Russell.

582
01:23:02,752 --> 01:23:06,173
You've got something of the senator's.
He wants it back.

583
01:23:06,256 --> 01:23:09,927
It's a little gold medal,
a family heirloom. He lost it.

584
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:12,847
He thinks you've got it.

585
01:23:15,307 --> 01:23:17,226
I don't know
what you're talking about.

586
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:26,402
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,
but I am so damn mad.

587
01:23:26,485 --> 01:23:28,112
This mor-

588
01:23:28,195 --> 01:23:31,032
This is Captain DeWitt,
he's with the police.

589
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:33,367
You're Miss Norman?

590
01:23:34,535 --> 01:23:35,620
Yes.

591
01:23:38,414 --> 01:23:41,251
I take it now, or I come back in an hour
with a warrant and a crew...

592
01:23:41,334 --> 01:23:43,003
and we tear this place apart.

593
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:45,547
"Tear this place apart"?

594
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:47,966
- What's going on here?
- I'll be here.

595
01:23:50,718 --> 01:23:52,136
Suit yourself.

596
01:23:56,224 --> 01:23:58,185
Well, what was that all about?

597
01:23:58,226 --> 01:24:01,355
Senator Carmichael thinks
he's being blackmailed.

598
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:10,823
They canceled your lease and forced me
to resign from the society.

599
01:24:10,906 --> 01:24:14,577
No explanation, no reason, nothing,
just "get out."

600
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:17,747
I have an appointment with the head
of the board of directors.

601
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:19,707
I'll see what I can find out.

602
01:24:19,748 --> 01:24:22,084
I'll call you and let you know.

603
01:25:50,717 --> 01:25:53,679
Yes? Yes, Claire?

604
01:25:53,762 --> 01:25:56,890
I was driving by,
and I recognized the car.

605
01:25:56,974 --> 01:25:59,560
I don't know how it happened.
I don't know how it could have happened.

606
01:25:59,643 --> 01:26:01,520
There are no other cars.
There's nothing.

607
01:26:01,562 --> 01:26:04,482
It's upside-down
in the middle of the road.

608
01:26:04,524 --> 01:26:07,569
It's that man- that policeman
who was just at your house.

609
01:26:07,652 --> 01:26:09,779
DeWitt. He's dead.

610
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:53,532
Carmichael. Any messages?

611
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,703
Oh, yes. Captain DeWitt.
What'd he say?

612
01:27:01,499 --> 01:27:02,750
What?

613
01:27:05,336 --> 01:27:06,588
Yeah.

614
01:27:10,634 --> 01:27:12,094
Oh, my God.

615
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:15,180
What?

616
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:19,852
Who? Russell.

617
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:25,315
All right.

618
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:29,236
Let me have that number.

619
01:27:45,879 --> 01:27:48,632
- John Russell.
- The senator's expecting you.

620
01:28:11,071 --> 01:28:12,990
- Still busy?
- Yes.

621
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:27,004
- Where are you going? Claire-
- I'll be back in a little while, Mom.

622
01:28:39,184 --> 01:28:41,811
All right.
Just what the hell do you want?

623
01:28:42,854 --> 01:28:44,773
You must have some idea.

624
01:28:46,274 --> 01:28:48,527
Well, I'm a busy man.
Make it fast.

625
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:55,075
The house on Chessman Park-

626
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,829
your family lived there
until 1906.

627
01:29:01,373 --> 01:29:04,835
It's had a history
of strange happenings.

628
01:29:05,878 --> 01:29:09,006
There's something in that house,
a manifestation.

629
01:29:10,883 --> 01:29:13,469
This afternoon, Captain DeWitt
came to see me...

630
01:29:13,553 --> 01:29:16,556
presumably on your behalf...

631
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,351
so you must have known what's happened,
at least as much as DeWitt could say-

632
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:27,066
the disturbances, the seance,
the bones found in the well.

633
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:31,654
I tried to talk to you
at the airport.

634
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:34,407
I showed you this.

635
01:29:39,204 --> 01:29:41,123
DeWitt said you'd lost it.

636
01:29:43,959 --> 01:29:45,919
I found it in the grave...

637
01:29:47,129 --> 01:29:48,839
where the child was buried.

638
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:57,097
There's no logical explanation
for what I'm going to say to you now.

639
01:29:58,682 --> 01:30:01,935
The boy was badly crippled.

640
01:30:02,019 --> 01:30:03,562
I believe he was killed...

641
01:30:03,646 --> 01:30:06,107
in an attic room of that house.

642
01:30:12,447 --> 01:30:14,115
I saw what happened...

643
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:19,955
and I believe it was
Richard Carmichael, your father...

644
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:24,375
who murdered the boy,
his natural son...

645
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:26,044
Joseph Carmichael.

646
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,634
Then there was a substitution
from the Sacred Heart Orphanage.

647
01:30:32,717 --> 01:30:34,970
The boy was taken to Europe...

648
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:40,100
cured miraculously
and returned to inherit an empire.

649
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:43,646
That changeling was you.

650
01:30:57,826 --> 01:31:01,539
So, that's your story.

651
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:03,541
Whatever you want to call it.

652
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:11,591
- How much?
- My God.

653
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:15,011
All right, how much do you want
for this farce that you've concocted?

654
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,972
This isn't blackmail.

655
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:19,683
I've been dealing with
vermin like you for years.

656
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:24,687
You wait your chance, then you come in
with a story so patently incredible-

657
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,147
Truth terrifies you, doesn't it?

658
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,942
It's the truth.
It won't be buried.

659
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:31,903
- Get out.
- None of this belongs to you.

660
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,364
Get out of here
with your filthy lies.

661
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:38,285
I should have gone to that dead child.
You suspected something all your life.

662
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:42,415
You're not Joseph Carmichael. You're
the beneficiary of the cruelest murder-

663
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:43,875
murder for profit.

664
01:31:47,378 --> 01:31:50,131
My father was not a murderer.

665
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,884
Nobody in this world can say that.

666
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,557
My father was a great man.

667
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,517
He was a loving man.

668
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:07,232
And for you to come in here
and accuse him of-

669
01:32:11,153 --> 01:32:13,155
How can you?

670
01:32:16,075 --> 01:32:18,035
Damn you!

671
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:24,916
I will not allow you
to slander his good name.

672
01:32:34,718 --> 01:32:37,763
These documents are on file
with the city.

673
01:32:40,391 --> 01:32:42,352
This is a tape of the seance.

674
01:32:44,312 --> 01:32:46,272
There's no copy.

675
01:32:47,649 --> 01:32:49,901
Take it.
I've done what I had to do.

676
01:32:56,616 --> 01:32:57,951
I'm sorry.

677
01:33:02,706 --> 01:33:06,418
If I find that you've breathed
one word of this-

678
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:07,753
one word-

679
01:33:07,794 --> 01:33:10,297
to anyone...

680
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,676
you'll wish you'd never
come into this world.

681
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:38,159
What was all that shouting about?

682
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:40,495
Nothing.

683
01:33:41,746 --> 01:33:42,998
Get out.

684
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:45,000
Leave me alone.

685
01:34:30,546 --> 01:34:33,716
John, I've tried to ca-

686
01:34:45,229 --> 01:34:47,898
This isn't like me.

687
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:50,151
John, where are you?

688
01:35:05,749 --> 01:35:07,710
John, what are you doing?

689
01:35:52,756 --> 01:35:55,968
Please.
I don't wanna come up there.

690
01:36:51,484 --> 01:36:53,485
I followed you.
I followed you.

691
01:37:04,747 --> 01:37:08,752
I thought you were here.
I kept calling and calling you.

692
01:37:10,378 --> 01:37:12,047
It's okay. Calm down.

693
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:15,717
- I want you to wait in the car for me.
- No, you're not going back in there!

694
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:18,846
- No, please, please, don't!
- Claire, Claire.

695
01:37:18,887 --> 01:37:21,056
Get ahold of yourself. Go on.

696
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,557
I'll be right back.
Don't worry.

697
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,522
Joseph, no!

698
01:39:03,078 --> 01:39:04,621
Father.

699
01:39:12,004 --> 01:39:14,173
My medal.

700
01:41:04,412 --> 01:41:06,539
Father, don't.

701
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:08,958
Help.
