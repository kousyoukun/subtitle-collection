1
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,750
Do you still think
that the world is vast?

2
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,460
That if there is a war
in one place,

3
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,090
it has no bearing on another?

4
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,220
And that you can
sit it out in peace...

5
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,430
ignoring all that you see?

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,810
We continue to slumber

7
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,480
as if the war being fought
within our borders

8
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,570
was not already
in its fifth year.

9
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,950
As if Chechnya was
as far from Europe

10
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,160
as the moon.

11
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,200
Come on. Let's go.

12
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,550
Anna Politkovskaya.

13
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,220
I want to see the test results.

14
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,880
That's not our normal procedure.

15
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,100
Well, she's not
a normal patient.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Sorry, are you a relative?

17
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,520
No, I'm her boss.

18
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,350
The results should be here.

19
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,440
I know, because I printed
them out earlier.

20
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,440
You think they
got deleted somehow?

21
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,200
Not only her test results...

22
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,780
there's no record
of her ever being admitted.

23
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,960
You're gonna be okay.

24
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,340
She's a fighter.

25
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,800
Your mother will live.

26
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,140
- What is it?
- We need to get her out of here.

27
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,550
Her records are missing.

28
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,060
You sure about this?

29
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,730
We don't have a choice.

30
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,280
It's not safe here.

31
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,490
They're gonna let her die.

32
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,280
Where are you?

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,070
Huh?

34
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,330
Two minutes.

35
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,290
Careful.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,620
Is she okay?

37
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,620
- Now hurry.
- Go.

38
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,550
Careful!

39
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,930
Seats.

40
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,050
- Okay.
- Easy, easy.

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,260
It's all right.

42
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,930
- Come on, come on.
- Come on now.

43
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,180
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

44
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,020
Watch her head.
Watch her head!

45
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,400
What are you doing?

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,860
The hospital in Likhovskoy
is almost 12 hours away.

47
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,440
If something happens,
are any of you trained?

48
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,650
Let's go.

49
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,660
You're gonna be okay, mama.

50
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,820
Transmission's been slipping,
but it should get you there.

51
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,580
You're paranoid.

52
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,000
Goddamn right I am.

53
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,620
Alexei, thank you.

54
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,790
- Thank you.
- Of course. Right.

55
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,380
Let's get her inside, ICU!

56
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,340
Quick as you can.

57
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,960
1, 2, 3, 4.

58
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,970
- Ca-- careful.
- Okay.

59
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,340
Okay.

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,390
Mind her head.

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,640
Papa, they've run
a thousand tests

62
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,810
but they know less than
when they started.

63
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,560
Stupid, stupid woman.

64
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,190
I told you
you cannot keep poking a bear

65
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,900
and expect him not
to bite back.

66
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,360
So, this is mama's fault?

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
No, no, it's mine, it's mine.

68
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,230
Should've fought harder.

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,740
Should've stopped her going
to the fucking country.

70
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,950
- I practically cheered her on.
- No.

71
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,780
Hey, sweetheart, listen.

72
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,870
Your mum makes her own mind up.

73
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,870
All you've ever done
is loved her,

74
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,540
just like she loved you
and your brother.

75
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,790
Okay?
You think about that.

76
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,170
Darling?

77
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,300
You, you okay?

78
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,090
- Vera?
- Yeah, you um...

79
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,680
you said, "loved".

80
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,060
Sorry.
No, I-- I-- what I meant--

81
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,810
I'll call you
if anything changes.

82
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,110
Is it okay if I pray?

83
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,410
Hello.

84
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,370
I'm Anna.

85
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,200
Who would like some pencils?

86
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,870
Can I give you those?
Thank you.

87
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,120
Thank you, thank you.

88
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,380
So, what happens to the ones

89
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,380
who don't get adopted?

90
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,340
If we can't place them in a
home before they reach 18,

91
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,760
they're transitioned.

92
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,720
So, forced out just in time
to get drafted.

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,810
No one's saying
the system is perfect.

94
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,190
The system doesn't work.

95
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Hello.

96
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,440
My name's Anna.

97
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,320
She won't speak.

98
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,450
We call her "Angela",
for angel.

99
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,660
Russian soldiers found her
wandering the outskirts

100
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,630
of Grozny not long after
the invasion began.

101
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,920
They thought she looked Russian,
so they had her brought here.

102
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,630
So, you're Chechen?

103
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,720
Shh.

104
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,930
Sorry.

105
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,810
I like your doll, Angela.

106
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,770
Hmm?

107
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,230
Did something bad happen
to your doll in Grozny?

108
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,980
- Oh.
- Angela!

109
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,820
No. It's--

110
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,230
I'll-- I'll get the director.

111
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,610
No, please, please, it's um--
it's all right.

112
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,650
Don't-- don't punish her.

113
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,700
Oh.

114
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,660
It was my fault.

115
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,910
I was being too nosy.

116
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,260
Sasha, I-- I know.
I'm just saying.

117
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,590
I may be a little--

118
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,380
Yes. I know you're busy.

119
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm busy, too. Okay.

120
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,680
Yes, we're busy people.
Right. Yes.

121
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,720
Bye, Sasha, bye, bye, bye.

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,810
- CO-WORKER 1: Morning.
- Oh, morning.

123
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,470
Bye.

124
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,270
- You're report.
- Oh, thank you, Pavan.

125
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,060
Thank you.

126
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,940
Relieved.

127
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,940
No. Whoa.
Wait, whoa, whoa.

128
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,320
No one is accusing anyone
of corruption, all right?

129
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,070
Our reporters just want to ask
you a few simple questions.

130
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,280
What kind of questions?

131
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,450
Well, uh, for example,
how does 21⁄2 billion rubles

132
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,250
allocated for
public building projects

133
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,080
end up being used
to build villas

134
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,290
in the south of Spain
for a bunch of rich guys?

135
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,750
You know what pisses me off?

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,090
Everything?

137
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,510
Well, besides that.

138
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,880
What, besides everything?

139
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,550
- Oysters.
- Huh?

140
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,140
There's a restaurant
in the Italian Alps,

141
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,810
it caters for wealthy Russians.

142
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,890
I've interviewed the owner.

143
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,600
I thought you were
writing about orphans.

144
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,150
Do you realize they have
eight kinds on the menu?

145
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,730
- Orphans?
- Oysters.

146
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,150
Flown in from
all over the world.

147
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,900
Well, what's that got
to do with the article?

148
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,110
Well, the budgets for state-run
orphanages are being slashed.

149
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,530
Kids are going hungry.

150
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,910
No one gives a damn,

151
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,950
and least of all,
the nouveau riche

152
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,910
- who are getting fat off--
- Exotic shellfish.

153
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah, I get it.

154
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,420
What happened to your nose?

155
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,960
Well, doesn't it piss you off?

156
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,340
Well, yeah, it pisses me off,
but what am I gonna do?

157
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,090
I can't find
the Berezovsky file.

158
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,340
And don't let the things
you write about upset you.

159
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,390
They don't.

160
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,510
I start off upset, then I write.

161
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,020
Where did I put
that bloody file?

162
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,520
- Where was it?
- Mm.

163
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,900
What's this?

164
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,030
- Toffee.
- Ugh.

165
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,860
- You don't like toffee?
- I like toffee.

166
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,360
I don't like rat turd.

167
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,370
Well, you should work
for a state-run paper.

168
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,200
I hear the toffees there
are excellent.

169
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
Yeah.

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,000
I hear the reporters'
salaries are, too.

171
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,920
Why are you here?

172
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,800
I just love spending
time with you.

173
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,220
You want an extension?

174
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
Two, three days?

175
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,890
One.

176
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,390
Thank you.

177
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,140
- And it better be brilliant.
- Yeah.

178
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,060
And don't slam the door.

179
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,780
Now, you must be aware

180
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,150
a lot of critics
are calling your book

181
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,780
flagrantly nationalistic.

182
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,490
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

183
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,370
I'm saying like the Soviet Union
dissolved in 1990,

184
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,870
and most people have
since moved on

185
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,910
from the idea
of a grander Russia.

186
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,620
If they have moved on
from land won

187
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,790
and fought for by the blood
of their forefathers,

188
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,170
then they are weak
and they are traitors.

189
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,220
That is an opinion, isn't it?

190
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,550
If you like it,

191
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,890
The Grander Russia
by our guest tonight,

192
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,470
Professor Vorobiev.

193
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,640
Something different tomorrow.
Look forward to seeing you then.

194
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,810
Goodnight.

195
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,850
And wrap.

196
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,650
Holy shit.

197
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,770
Thanks.

198
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,780
Phew.

199
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,320
Where did they find him?

200
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,110
- You were wonderful.
- Oh, yeah?

201
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,040
Your new friend looks
so particularly jolly.

202
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,250
Who, Frankenstein's nephew?

203
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,870
Secret police
stamped on his face?

204
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,380
I don't know
why we get all the attention.

205
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,960
It's not like I'm calling
for regime change live on TV.

206
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,010
Why not?

207
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,470
Because, darling, the man
has only just come to power

208
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,930
and-- and it would be impolite.

209
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,970
Well, then-- then call him out
for what he is,

210
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,060
an ex-KGB goon obsessed
with lining his own pockets.

211
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,230
That's a great idea.

212
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,860
I remember a time when you
wouldn't have thought twice.

213
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,230
I remember a time when you
knew how to duck a punch.

214
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,620
So, how was your day at the
cold face of truth, my darling?

215
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,040
Well, no one knows what
happened to her parents.

216
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,620
I mean, dead probably.

217
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,290
And she won't say.

218
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,420
And you couldn't
drag it out of her.

219
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,300
One-nil to the orphans.

220
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,550
Not funny, Sasha.

221
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,260
I feel for the girl.
Just being impartial.

222
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,050
You should try it sometime.

223
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,510
Then you wouldn't
be you, would you?

224
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,560
Let's have a look.

225
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,600
Ooh.

226
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,850
She's got a hell of a jab.

227
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,520
Yeah. Well, Putin hit her first.

228
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,110
Apart from your amazing rapport,
how's the piece going?

229
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,940
Oh.

230
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,150
Well, I've got one more
interview, then I will write,

231
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,450
Dimitri will publish,
and nothing will happen.

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,920
When Putin was assistant
mayor of Saint Petersburg...

233
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,720
he was banking 25% commission

234
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
on thousands
of unauthorized contracts

235
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,560
for food shipments,
most of which came back short

236
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,520
in the middle
of a food shortage.

237
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,270
Well, maybe look for any links
with the local mafia.

238
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,690
Uh, Nestor,
anything new in Chechnya?

239
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,860
I was thinking,

240
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,360
would it hurt to give him some
credit once in a while?

241
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,950
The Chechens started this thing.

242
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,660
What, so they
invaded themselves?

243
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,240
He put down a rebellion.

244
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,290
Barely 12 months later, all
that's left is some mopping up.

245
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,870
In my book,
that's a success story.

246
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,170
Sounds more like a fantasy.

247
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,460
Except I've sat down with
three of Putin's top generals.

248
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,250
Generals? Wow.

249
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,710
Then did you have his mother
on background?

250
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,630
And I was there.

251
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,890
In Grozny?

252
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,390
Wasn't on the list.

253
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,970
So, the army dictates
where you can go

254
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,760
and what you can see.

255
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,310
I mean, why pay someone
to go down there?

256
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,310
Maybe we should publish
the army's press releases

257
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,640
every week. I mean, whoa.

258
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,400
- Think of the savings.
- All right. All right.

259
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,610
- Ignore them.
- Dmitry, I um...

260
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,070
Well, I personally think our
whole approach to Chechnya,

261
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,200
it's-- well, it's wrong.

262
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,030
I'm listening.

263
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,740
Well, maybe we should
vary our point of view.

264
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,620
I mean, right now, it's--
it's the Russian army's.

265
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,630
What if it was the Chechens?

266
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,630
Look, I--
I don't mean the rebels.

267
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,460
I've tried.

268
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,970
The-- the few civilians I've met
won't talk to me,

269
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,050
because I'm Russian.

270
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,760
What am I supposed to do?

271
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,470
Pretend I'm from Bolivia?

272
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,600
How's your Spanish?

273
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,930
All right.

274
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,310
That's it. Thank you.

275
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,900
She's right, you know?

276
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
About Nestor?

277
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,490
He's naive. He'll learn.

278
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,410
He's fucking useless.

279
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,870
And he's left his facts.

280
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,580
He's cheap.

281
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,790
No, if our readers want to be
fed propaganda,

282
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,750
they can read Tass
or switch on the TV.

283
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,170
That's not what we're about.
You know who'd agree with that?

284
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,420
Oh, here we go.

285
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,000
The reason why Gorbachev set up
this paper in the first place

286
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,710
and spent his Nobel Prize money
doing it is

287
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,670
so there'd be at least
one source--

288
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Of honest reporting.

289
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
I know.

290
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm taking that photo down.

291
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,930
We don't need
a war correspondent down there,

292
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,810
Dmitry.

293
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,600
Everyone's got one of those.

294
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,770
So, what do we need?

295
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,240
Sorry to interrupt.

296
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,070
I read your orphanage piece.

297
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,580
You did a great job.

298
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,000
Thank you.

299
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,260
Oh, wh-- I...

300
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,220
I've just been chatting
with Yuri.

301
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,970
Hmm.

302
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,890
And we agree with you.

303
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,230
We don't think we need
a war correspondent in Chechnya.

304
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,520
We need a people correspondent.

305
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,610
Oh, good.

306
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,650
Someone who's um, sensitive,
empathetic,

307
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,370
but also tough-minded
and uh, willing to confront

308
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,330
the powerful
by asking hard questions...

309
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,960
even if it means
pissing them off.

310
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,760
Well, it'll be a week
at most.

311
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,630
And-- and look, it's my job.

312
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,050
I think it's a great idea.

313
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,220
- Thank you.
- How is it a great idea?

314
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
I mean, how is going to
a war zone even close

315
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,100
to a great idea?

316
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,730
Maybe Ilya
doesn't like Chechens.

317
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,930
Who said anything
about Chechens?

318
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,230
What, do you think,
because she's a woman

319
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,150
she can't handle herself?

320
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,650
Oh, and you think
a bullet cares?

321
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,150
I'm going to talk to people,

322
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,780
some of whom happen
to worship Allah,

323
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,900
and write about them.

324
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,950
And papa?

325
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,660
I mean, he's okay with this?

326
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,200
Absolutely.

327
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,790
That's the stupidest
fucking thing

328
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,460
I've ever heard in my life.

329
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,920
Did you know that the war
between Russia and Chechnya

330
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,880
is the longest ongoing conflict
in the world?

331
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,760
- I didn't. Did you--
- Fuck's sake. Hey!

332
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,840
- Oh, God.
- I'm your husband, okay?

333
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,630
I'm the father of your kids.

334
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,140
I love you.

335
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,180
And I-- I-- I-- I need
you to stick around.

336
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,560
So, no, it's not happening.

337
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,390
You call Dmitry tomorrow,

338
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,850
you tell him you've changed
your mind.

339
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,480
Right? Right?

340
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
Have you finished?

341
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,610
I'm going, Sasha.

342
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,400
I'm going.

343
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,780
Oh, fuck. Christ.

344
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,580
Come on then, listen.

345
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,490
Listen, you give a copy
of your passport

346
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,950
and your itinerary to Dmitry.

347
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,580
No. In fact, to both of us,
and you don't go anywhere,

348
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,370
not-- not one yard off,

349
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,710
where we've seen written down
that you're going.

350
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,550
- Yes?
- Yes, right.

351
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,710
Okay?

352
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,970
Jesus Christ, you're
not going to fucking Disneyland.

353
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,550
People are killing each other.
Do you understand?

354
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,470
They're shooting each other.
They're blowing each other up.

355
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,810
You get in the middle and then
you're fucking dead, too.

356
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,390
Right.

357
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,560
- No, don't--
- Sasha, I--

358
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,940
No, don't Sasha me.

359
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,560
You promise me
you'll be careful.

360
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,570
I promise you that
I'll really be careful.

361
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,360
Shh.

362
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,070
Oh.

363
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,600
Captain Turgenev,

364
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,890
you know as much as I'd like
to submit an article

365
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,440
about the back of your head,
it-- it-- it would be helpful

366
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,060
if we could stop
and talk to people.

367
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,270
Yeah, it would be, but we stop
in Khiris, not before.

368
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,690
Yes?

369
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,400
You know,
maybe we don't stop at all.

370
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,470
Anna, get out!

371
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,680
Come on!

372
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,470
Come on!

373
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,520
Stay down!

374
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,440
First time in action?

375
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,950
Pretty cool, huh?

376
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,870
What's happening?

377
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,080
- Stay down!
- Okay, okay!

378
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,200
Stop shouting.

379
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,130
Moving clear!

380
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,110
- Good.
- Thank you.

381
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,870
...the battle
in Grozny is now underway.

382
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,750
The Russian Army Commander
has declared

383
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,420
that anyone remaining
in the city will be considered

384
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,710
a legitimate target
for artillery and air strikes.

385
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,050
Uh, come on, not again.

386
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,720
You can ignore him
if you want to.

387
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,800
Well, she's not
the only one

388
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,890
who's been to a war zone,
you know?

389
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,060
Hmm, dad.

390
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,930
We were all lined up
behind a church wall.

391
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,520
- It's blowing up bit by bit.
- Come on, dad.

392
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,640
- Papa, come on.
- Excuse me.

393
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,440
How many times?

394
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,860
It's fine everybody's heard it,
it's a classic.

395
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,270
I have heard this story
nine times now.

396
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,690
So, and the machine gunfire's
like coming

397
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,190
through the belly of all that.

398
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,070
And they stopped
and this guy jumps out

399
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,070
and he goes, "Don't shoot,
man, we're journalists!

400
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,160
I'm from the New York Times."

401
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,370
And the guy says,
"Oh no, I hate your crosswords!"

402
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,290
- Blows the whole place up.
- There you go.

403
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,580
I would be so frightened.

404
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,170
You probably weren't
frightened at all.

405
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,000
Uh, I think I actually
pissed my pants.

406
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,880
- Sasha!
- I did.

407
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,920
So, who is the scariest person
you've ever met?

408
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,470
Um, I wonder...

409
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,760
Asshole.

410
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,600
Was it?
I thought it was pork.

411
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,850
- Oh, no.
- I bet you're all glad

412
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,680
she isn't going back
to Chechnya.

413
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,600
Awkward.

414
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,810
No.

415
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,670
What's this? We need this
moving now, faster, come on.

416
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,180
Come on, people!
Let's move it along!

417
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,600
Let's go, now!

418
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,510
Come on!
Faster, guys, faster!

419
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,930
The entire city
is being emptied.

420
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,770
They go to camps
near the border.

421
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,900
Excuse me?

422
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,320
Excuse me, would you talk to me?

423
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,450
Uh, where were you...

424
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,580
Look, I'm a journalist.
Could you talk?

425
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,240
I'm just try--
Why won't anybody talk to me?

426
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,160
Look.

427
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,330
What's happened?

428
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,420
The Russian Army.

429
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,540
What?
Could you explain?

430
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,170
- What?
- Mm.

431
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,340
Please, what...

432
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,220
I just want to help.

433
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,470
I just want to help.

434
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,060
I'm just-- Look, I'm-- I'm--

435
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,310
Fuck this. Fuck.

436
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,280
- Hello?
- Dmitry?

437
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,530
- Anna?
- Dmitry?

438
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,110
Can you hear--

439
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,820
It's--

440
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,330
Oh, shit!

441
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,660
Hey, can I ask you something?

442
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,250
I thought a reporter's job was
to report and not help, huh?

443
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,090
In the case
of Russian reporters,

444
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,670
to spoon feed whatever version
of the truth

445
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,050
the Kremlin deems fit.

446
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,300
Well, that might be true
for some.

447
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,380
But not all.

448
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,930
The paper I work for believes
that people deserve the truth,

449
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,310
not lies.

450
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,510
They're choking on lies.

451
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Oh, you think the truth
will go down easier?

452
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,940
Would you talk to me?

453
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,060
I took the word of
a Russian reporter once.

454
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,230
I swore never again.

455
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,690
Please!

456
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,120
Politkovskaya!
Let's go. Time to go.

457
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,460
Go without me.

458
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,050
What did you say to me?

459
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,630
I'm staying.

460
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,930
There's one thing lies
between you

461
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,300
and these vicious
Chechen dogs...

462
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,510
...the Russian Armed Forces.

463
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,890
The forces concerned
for my welfare,

464
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,890
you know, it's touching.

465
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,640
But I don't see any dogs
on this road,

466
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
vicious or otherwise.

467
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,900
What I do see is people
desperate to flee Grozny.

468
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,070
Now, why?

469
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,940
I don't know.

470
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,570
Suit yourself,
but you're on your own.

471
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,950
In the vehicle, let's go!

472
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,330
I am--
I could do with a drink.

473
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,330
Look, I have to be sure
what I've just done

474
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,540
isn't gonna get me killed.

475
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,130
As I can't be sure,
I have to assume the risk.

476
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,260
I'm Anna Politkovskaya,
by the way.

477
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,350
Anzor.

478
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,930
If you really want
to report the truth...

479
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
I'll show you difficult things
for you to see.

480
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,400
Great.

481
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,150
Can we go now?

482
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,900
You've entered
the black hole

483
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,110
of the world, Anna.

484
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,490
No light
or truth escapes from here.

485
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,900
Hello.

486
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,760
How do they survive?

487
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,680
This is...

488
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,810
Hi, hello.

489
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,850
My name is Anna.

490
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,480
What's your name?

491
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,060
Please, who are you?

492
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,270
What you do here?

493
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,320
It's okay.
This is Anna Politkovskaya.

494
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,360
- She wants to tell our story.
- Russian?

495
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,610
Yes, I'm Russian.

496
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,410
I'm a journalist
from the Novaya Gazeta.

497
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,820
I know people like you
are liars.

498
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,290
She's different.

499
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,790
What is your name?

500
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,370
Fatima.

501
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Would you talk with me, Fatima?

502
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,630
Please?

503
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,340
If I talk, you tell my story
and no lies.

504
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,800
I promise.

505
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,770
Thank you.

506
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,600
Come.

507
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,530
Would it be okay
if I recorded you?

508
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,530
Yes.

509
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,830
Okay, thank you.

510
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,590
Just put that there.

511
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,670
Vakha loved me.

512
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,300
Never in his life did he hurt
another human being.

513
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,050
I could always make him laugh.

514
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,350
That's what he loved about me,
my sense of humor.

515
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,270
Most men, they want to
be the funny one but...

516
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,810
Vakha didn't care.

517
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,780
When they found his body...

518
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,530
he had been shot several times.

519
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,540
Both ears cut off
and kept as trophies.

520
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,250
I'll tell you who does this.

521
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,040
Russians.

522
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,720
I'd go home immediately.

523
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,100
But everything's gone.

524
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,390
They destroyed my house.

525
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,060
There's nowhere I can go.

526
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,360
They killed my husband.

527
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,030
My kids have no father.

528
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,700
I am freezing and terrified.

529
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,580
No one cares about us.

530
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,580
No one will help us,
we're here all alone.

531
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,460
The war's taken everything.

532
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,210
"When they find out
you're a reporter,

533
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,880
they cling to you,
as if you are a magician,

534
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,930
as if something essential
depended on you.

535
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,270
This war is not being fought
to rein in a rogue republic.

536
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,430
This war is being waged

537
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,770
to advance the interests
of one person...

538
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,940
a president intent on becoming
the type of leader

539
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,320
that Russia thought it had left
in the past,

540
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:57,700
a vain, brutal,
power-hungry authoritarian."

541
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,040
Jesus.

542
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,340
Well, you said you were
gonna be tough on him.

543
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,710
You've dropped a bomb
on his doorstep.

544
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,260
I was aiming for his lap.

545
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,300
You're set on blowing up
the whole damn operation.

546
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,260
Oh, well, then I'll add
something about

547
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,680
what a good father is

548
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,970
and how much his generals
give to charities.

549
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,810
The hospital burns ward.

550
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,060
Move it up
to the first paragraph.

551
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,230
Tone down the gore.

552
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,400
Other than that,
don't change a word.

553
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,150
We're gonna publish part
of your report each week.

554
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,450
Thank you.

555
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,450
Before Putin, you know how
Russians felt about themselves.

556
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,450
He made it okay for us
to love our country again.

557
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,620
Some of us never stopped.

558
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,600
We are hurtling back
into a Soviet abyss.

559
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,110
An information vacuum
that spells death

560
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,280
from our own ignorance.

561
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,950
If you choose to be
a journalist in Russia,

562
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,410
you have to accept the risk.

563
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,420
Happy birthday.

564
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,750
I'm sorry, I-- I can't be--

565
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,920
What, something...

566
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,840
Uh, Ilya, sorry.

567
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,300
Really bad, bad signal.

568
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,930
Did-- did you get
the present I sent?

569
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,550
Yes.

570
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,220
It's a Sufi saying.

571
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,100
It's beautiful, mama,
but I um,

572
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,640
I don't know what it says.

573
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,060
"Only from the heart
can you touch the sky."

574
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,650
What's that noise?

575
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,440
Are those bombs?

576
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,030
Howitzer fire.

577
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,820
The 120th are making a push

578
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,030
so Putin has something to brag
about before the election.

579
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,160
Well, it sounds close.

580
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,240
I don't know.
I'd say it's 5 kilometers away.

581
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,290
Yeah.

582
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,790
Uh, hold on.

583
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,880
There we go.

584
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,760
Step out of the car.

585
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,050
Is there a problem?

586
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,470
Step out of the car.

587
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,390
- Let me call you back.
- No, mama, wait.

588
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,640
- Sorry.
- Move. Come on.

589
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,150
Please, can you explain
what the problem is?

590
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,060
- Hey.
- So, where are you taking us?

591
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,190
Shut the fuck up!

592
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,480
Journalist.

593
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,240
Yes, I'm a journalist
and I'm certified to be here.

594
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,820
But please, please read.

595
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,860
Can you not touch--

596
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,740
Oh!

597
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,450
Oh, oh, God.

598
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,500
Oh.

599
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,180
Fucking bastards.

600
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,430
You should write a report.
They could've killed you.

601
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,720
They're nobodies.

602
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,350
I'm not gonna open people's
eyes by feeding them nobodies.

603
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,440
Well, next time, Anna, some
nobody is likely to break more

604
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,900
than your tape recorder.

605
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,360
Hey.

606
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,450
- Great ratings last night.
- Yeah.

607
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,870
Best of the series.

608
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,330
Yesterday's news now.

609
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,830
Your wife, she's making
quite a name for herself.

610
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,920
Pfft.

611
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,630
Well, she raised the kids

612
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,460
while I made a name
for myself, so...

613
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,420
Yeah, it's only fair.

614
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,180
A bit reckless, don't you think?

615
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,350
She says she's well aware
of the danger she's in, so.

616
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,520
But are you?

617
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,430
What's gonna happen to me?

618
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
She could poke my eye
out with a brush.

619
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,020
Have a great show.

620
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,120
Sorry.

621
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,540
Stuck at work.

622
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,590
She's on a mission.

623
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,420
Uh, it's not easy for any of us.

624
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,550
No, all right, well--

625
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,090
Well, what if you'd found out
that for the past year

626
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,300
instead of running off
to Chechnya all the time,

627
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,260
she was running into the arms
of another man?

628
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,680
I mean, h-- how, how
would you feel then?

629
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,350
Like sharing?

630
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,610
They shouldn't have
sent her to a conflict.

631
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,270
She's a people correspondent.

632
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,570
She loves people.

633
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,400
It's who she is.

634
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,450
- Finished, sir?
- Thank you.

635
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,870
You know, today in her column,
you know what she called him?

636
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,790
A gangster.

637
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,170
That's your mum.

638
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,920
Beautiful, tender,

639
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,510
and with all the tact
of a T-90 tank.

640
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,970
People are starting to notice
how much she hates him.

641
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,470
She hates what he's doing.

642
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,230
She hates the war.

643
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,060
Almost as much
as she loves Chechens.

644
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,400
Hey, we're here to enjoy
ourselves, remember?

645
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,450
Drink.

646
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,620
Were you never tempted
to join the rebels?

647
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,960
You know, Anna,
one day I'd woken up

648
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,830
and a war had broken out.

649
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,500
Yes, most of my friends,
they joined the rebels,

650
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,760
but I didn't hate the Russians
enough to kill them, so.

651
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,090
You know, some people think
the only way to end the war

652
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,550
is by winning it.

653
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,890
May I say you end
the war by ending it.

654
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,640
Oh, oh.

655
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,850
We can't talk about
something else?

656
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,270
We have a guest in our home.

657
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,730
The war can wait.

658
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,270
- I didn't give you a drink.
- But I was--

659
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,940
Come, come, come.
I told him to give you a drink.

660
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,440
Mama, you said do the plate.

661
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,650
This is Amina, Zarina, Amir,
and Khava.

662
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,070
Come, come, come.
So tonight, as a family, we eat.

663
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,240
- Oh.
- And we drink.

664
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,990
Oh. Thank you.

665
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,410
You know, it smells amazing.

666
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,120
Oh, Anna, you're in for a treat.

667
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,540
My mother, she makes the best
jijig-chorpa in Chechnya.

668
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,330
Hey, hey.
Who raised you, huh?

669
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,250
- Wolves? Leave it.
- Mama.

670
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,460
Ah.

671
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,960
Oh, Natalya.

672
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,090
- Delicious.
- I picked it.

673
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,670
I cleaned it.
I cooked it all by myself.

674
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,920
Mama. I did nothing.

675
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,300
You did nothing.
You never do anything.

676
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,630
I'm the one who picked it,

677
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,390
- so I don't know what--
- That's a lie.

678
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,260
All right.

679
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,350
Don't listen to them.

680
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,890
They're liars.

681
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,560
Well, I want to make
a toast to Anna.

682
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
Oh, no, no, no, no.

683
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,110
For bringing hope
and light to the Chechen people,

684
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,780
for keeping your promise.

685
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,200
And I promise that I'll
continue to keep it.

686
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,240
To Anna.

687
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,660
- To Anna.
- Mm.

688
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,700
You see?

689
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,410
My cousin, Anzor,
is her personal driver.

690
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,580
They are very famous.

691
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,130
Isn't the target on
my back big enough?

692
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,800
Time for sweet things, huh?

693
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,220
Yeah.

694
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,420
Have you ever met
any of these men?

695
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Never.

696
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,630
They're Chechen civilians
who disappeared on

697
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,720
or around January the 2nd.

698
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,760
Now, I've been in contact
with people from their village

699
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,850
who allege that members of your
militia unit detained these men

700
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,440
and then over a series of days,

701
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,310
and under
your strict supervision,

702
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,940
subjected them to torture.

703
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,410
Do you know this man?

704
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,750
Salambek Turamov.

705
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,290
Our sources allege that
you tortured Salambek,

706
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,380
before you dragged him
to a cell

707
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,760
at the October district offices
and killed him.

708
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,390
Do you care to comment?

709
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,560
You're accusing me of murder?

710
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,520
Salambek's parents are.

711
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,740
Take down this statement...

712
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,330
"I am an officer in the army
of the Russian Federation...

713
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,250
not a murderer."

714
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,760
But write your little story.

715
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,090
No one will read it beyond
a few liberal faggots in Moscow.

716
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,970
It's true,

717
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,680
we don't have the number
of readers of other papers,

718
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,430
but you see,

719
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,350
there's only one number
that matters to me,

720
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,440
and that's the number of
prosecutors needed to bring

721
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,150
charges of first-degree murder

722
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,940
against an officer
of the Russian Army.

723
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,030
And that number is one.

724
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,830
I think we're done here,
aren't we?

725
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,750
You do know
I could slit your throat

726
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,050
and let you bleed out
like a pig?

727
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,800
Thank you for taking the time
to talk to me, Major.

728
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,560
Now, if you don't mind,
my driver is expecting me.

729
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
- Good morning.
- Morning.

730
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,270
Uh, what happened
to my desk?

731
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,560
It's well--
well, it's neat.

732
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Oh, it's uh, probably
the new intern.

733
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,610
She just showed up.

734
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,780
She was a cub reporter
for a local newspaper.

735
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,490
Says she wants
to be a proper journalist.

736
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,950
Yeah, well, she wants to
stay away from my desk.

737
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,950
I like you pissed off.

738
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,410
That's how I want you to
address the Security Council.

739
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,960
Oh. Thank you.

740
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,880
I'm Anna.

741
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,630
I know.

742
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,000
What are you doing right now?

743
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,420
Um, I'm making coffees.

744
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,380
Well, you're not gonna learn
how to be a journalist

745
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,760
doing that. Okay?

746
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,930
I want you to help me draft
our statement to the UN.

747
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,940
Call Natalya, tell her
that you work for me.

748
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,400
I want a list of every complaint
against Russian troops

749
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,440
in Chechnya
in the last six months,

750
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,820
and then plan to spend the rest
of the day making calls.

751
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,200
Oh, and uh,
I'll have a tea, no sugar.

752
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,500
I dislike Putin,
because he despises his people.

753
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,120
He sees us simply as a means
to his ends,

754
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,590
a means for the achievement
and retention of power.

755
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:43,090
He believes he can do
with us as he sees fit.

756
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:46,050
"Because we are nobody.

757
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,100
While he who chances
and able to clamber to the top.

758
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,230
is today Czar and God.

759
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,440
In Russia, we have had leaders
with this outlook before.

760
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,690
Led to tragedy, to bloodshed on
a vast scale,

761
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,110
and to civil wars."

762
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,860
"I do not want that.

763
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,240
So, I dislike this
typical Soviet Chekist."

764
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,870
Or a member of the
old secret police.

765
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:14,870
I know what Checkist means.

766
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,880
Only no one else
outside Russia will.

767
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,130
Well, if-- if I'd have known
the Associated Press

768
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,590
were gonna pick it up,

769
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,590
well, then, I would
have phrased it differently.

770
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,970
"I don't like this typical
Soviet Chekist

771
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,840
as he struts down
the red carpet

772
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,390
of the Kremlin throne room
as if he actually owns it.

773
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,060
The gold is polished
and shines.

774
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,150
Servants smile obediently.

775
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,940
Comrades,
former KGB colleagues

776
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,900
promoted way
beyond their limited talents

777
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,200
by his, assume a dignified air."

778
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,070
Jesus Christ.

779
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Well, it's powerful,
Putin as emperor.

780
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,330
Someone had to say it,
I suppose.

781
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,000
Maybe someone in a position
of power

782
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,880
will take five minutes
out of their busy day

783
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,130
and look up Chechnya on a map.

784
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,770
What?
What are you looking at?

785
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,350
Hmm?

786
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,650
Nothing.

787
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,960
Oh, thank you.

788
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,220
Excuse me, do you mind?

789
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,470
Nope, nope.

790
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,440
You're a writer.

791
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,360
Hmm.

792
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,940
It's just a guess.

793
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,400
You've got that haunted look of
someone with a deadline to meet.

794
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,080
I wish I could write.

795
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,210
I'd write about history.

796
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,630
The old czars, Ivan, Peter.

797
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,340
I mean, nowadays, you can say
what you want about them

798
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,710
and no one seems to care,
but back then...

799
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,640
And you had to be bloody careful
what you said about the church.

800
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,430
It was all in the Stoglav.

801
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,430
Do you know what that was?

802
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,770
It was a record of the czar's
questions to the clergy

803
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,730
and their responses.

804
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,940
It established the code
of canon law.

805
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,860
And what writers
were allowed to express.

806
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,950
These are amazing.

807
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,120
I can see why you come here
every morning.

808
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,250
What are you?

809
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,630
You need to stop.

810
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,930
Stop what?

811
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,720
Criticizing the czar?

812
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,560
Understand, it makes
no difference to me.

813
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,190
Me, personally,
I enjoy your column.

814
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,650
I look forward to it.

815
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,820
Your passion,
your concern for humanity,

816
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,820
your fondness
for the Chechen people,...

817
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,030
all of that is commendable.

818
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,120
But it doesn't change
your situation.

819
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,750
And what is
my situation exactly?

820
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,500
Been nice to meet you.

821
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,520
Morning.

822
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,270
- Good morning.
- Hi.

823
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,820
Oh, come on.

824
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,530
Oh, Gregor. Hi.

825
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,610
Yeah.

826
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,120
- I'll be a minute.
- Sasha.

827
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,580
- What have they done?
- Sasha?

828
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,120
Yeah.

829
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,450
I need to have a little chat
with you.

830
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,040
Well, now? I'm late.

831
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,540
Come with me, my friend,

832
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,120
because this is completely out
of my hands.

833
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

834
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,940
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

835
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,060
- Who is that?
- He--

836
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,570
It's no one.

837
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,690
- Leave it, Ilya--
- But why is he staring at you?

838
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,650
I-- I don't know.

839
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,490
Just come on. Ilya.

840
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,780
Ilya, leave it, please.

841
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,740
Hey!

842
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,580
Oi!

843
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,630
Oh, Ilya, he's gone.

844
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,340
Ayi, yai, yai.

845
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,510
Oh.

846
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,730
This place is a mess.

847
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,690
I've been back a week.
I-- I can't get into it.

848
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,780
No, it's his mess.
He should clean it.

849
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,200
Your father, well, he's--
he's having a hard time.

850
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
He hates not working.

851
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,120
Look, stop making
excuses for him.

852
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,740
Look, look, look, Ilya.

853
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,120
Hey.

854
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,240
It's okay.

855
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,580
No, it's not okay, all right?

856
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,790
It's-- it's-- it's not.

857
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,330
None of this is okay.

858
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,050
Not papa, not strangers
stalking you in the street.

859
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:36,840
Oh, oh--

860
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,260
Probably the unhinged subject
of some article

861
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,760
you've written who now
has it in for you

862
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,590
or the fact that,
for the past two years,

863
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
I've woken up every morning

864
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,140
and wondered if today
is gonna be the day

865
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,270
that I get a call from someone
telling me

866
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,730
my mother's been found
in a ditch, right?

867
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,060
It-- it-- it is all so not okay.

868
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,440
Ilya...

869
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,360
Oh.

870
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,650
Thought it was you.

871
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,480
Hi.

872
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,240
Hello. Welcome home.

873
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,660
Are you uh, you gonna stay
for dinner?

874
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,570
No.

875
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,830
Oh, Ilya.

876
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:06,580
Ilya!

877
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,120
Why is he upset?
What did you say?

878
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,620
What'd you say to him?

879
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,380
You know, as much as I love
working all day then,

880
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,840
oh, doing the shopping
and then, ooh, making dinner,

881
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,710
it would be nice

882
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:21,380
if maybe you did it
for a change.

883
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,220
Yeah, I'm busy!
I'm doing something.

884
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,350
- Doing what?
- I'm logging the death threats.

885
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,230
Why?

886
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,190
Oh.

887
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,400
- Sasha.
- Talking of which,

888
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,900
your favorite war criminal
called today.

889
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,650
I saved it for you.
Here you go.

890
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,320
Hear that?

891
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,740
You're dead.

892
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,240
I'm gonna cut your tits off
and feed them to the beast dogs.

893
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,990
Yeah?

894
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,740
Last time,
it was your uterus.

895
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,040
Something tells me
mad Major Lapin's

896
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,290
got serious mommy issues.

897
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,540
No one's asking you to do this.

898
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,960
We need a record.

899
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,090
And anyway...

900
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,670
what else am I gonna do?

901
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,390
Have you written
any more query letters?

902
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,180
I've written plenty
of letters, all right?

903
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,560
No one's writing back.

904
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,270
You will.
It's just a matter of time--

905
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,900
- It's--
- And it will happen.

906
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,860
It's just like the old days.

907
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,020
Can't you feel it?

908
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,070
It's like someone's pried open
Stalin's crypt

909
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,650
and the stench is in the air.

910
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,070
What about Vasily?

911
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,820
- Have you called him--
- Please don't.

912
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,910
Just...

913
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,040
They're all shit scared of him.

914
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,420
Big joke. They're not
even trying to get to me.

915
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,960
- Sorry. I'm so-- I--
- No, no. No.

916
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,050
I've got to make dinner.

917
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,680
Sorry.

918
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,430
Excuse me, can I help you?

919
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,520
I need to speak to Anna,
Anna Politkovskaya.

920
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,690
One minute.

921
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,490
Excuse me? Hey.

922
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,240
You can't go here.

923
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
Stop him.

924
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,370
What's going on?

925
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

926
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,910
You need to have
an appointment here.

927
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,710
You can't just barge in here.

928
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,790
- You're s--
- Hold on, hold on.

929
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,960
It's okay.

930
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,250
You know this guy?

931
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,840
I've seen him around.

932
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,630
Can I help you?

933
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,260
Army?

934
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,470
Lance corporal.
Semenov, Ivan.

935
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,640
5th Army,
Motorized Rifle Brigade.

936
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,430
You fought in Gudermes?

937
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,180
You guys took heavy casualties.

938
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,600
They took more.

939
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,100
Look,

940
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,190
I know you want to
tell me something,

941
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,150
because you've
been following me.

942
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,240
They lied.

943
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,070
They said it was for rubbish.

944
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,040
Right. Ivan, come with me.

945
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,410
- It's okay. Please.
- Anna--

946
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,120
Let him go.

947
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,080
Dmitry, I'm okay, honestly.

948
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,080
Please, this way.

949
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,960
Follow me.

950
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,960
- You sure?
- Positive.

951
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,090
Take a seat.

952
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,100
We dug the trench,
me and some guys from my squad.

953
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,350
It was the staff sergeant
who said they planned

954
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,900
to bury rubbish in it.

955
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,610
I had no reason
not to believe him.

956
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,070
The next day, a bunch of special
forces showed up at the camp.

957
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,990
They were ethnic Chechens

958
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,950
who'd fought
against the Russians at first,

959
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,580
then switched sides.

960
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,790
I couldn't figure out
why they were there.

961
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,710
Then a large group
of non-combatants

962
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,210
was herded out of the camp

963
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,260
and marched towards
the edge of the trench,

964
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,510
the one we'd dug
to bury the rubbish.

965
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,060
The special forces were waiting
with their rifles.

966
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,730
The camp was dismantled
a week later

967
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,360
and went away without a trace...

968
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,530
an entire camp.

969
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,410
Do you um,

970
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,330
do you think you
could draw a map?

971
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,620
You promise not
to publish my name?

972
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,800
If you promise you're not lying.

973
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,910
Anna.

974
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,990
You know, the whole time it has
been right under my nose.

975
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,790
What?

976
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,790
The camp that Corporal Semenov
was assigned to, you know?

977
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,540
He reckons there's over
two hundred bodies buried there

978
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,630
and according to him,

979
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,960
the same thing is happening
all over the region.

980
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,180
You know, if this checks out,
you know what this is?

981
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,680
Yeah.

982
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,730
- You're not going down there.
- Why not?

983
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,190
Because you're due to address
the Security Council

984
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,940
in five days.

985
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,110
Well, that can wait.

986
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,770
Oh, for God's sake, Anna!

987
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,860
You have been invited
to bear witness

988
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,280
by the British delegation
to the United Nations, right?

989
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,410
It is not some nail salon
you can call up

990
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,410
and change an appointment
anytime you want.

991
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,830
Look, Semenov came to me,

992
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,080
because I'm the only one
he can trust.

993
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,960
No. He trusts this newspaper!

994
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,590
And that is
who you work for,

995
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,090
not the other way around.

996
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,720
Oh.

997
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,100
Okay. I-- I get it.
I get it, okay?

998
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,890
Chechnya's your baby.

999
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,350
Well, this newspaper is mine.

1000
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,480
And it certainly isn't
because of the money.

1001
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,730
I could earn twice as
much anywhere else, right?

1002
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,650
But then I'd be in
the bullshit business.

1003
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:15,780
And that is why I was so happy

1004
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,570
when the invitation came
from the UN.

1005
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,450
I saw Kofi Annan's signature
and I thought, "Okay.

1006
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:24,620
Maybe we are doing
something right." Okay?

1007
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,830
And by we, I don't mean you
and me.

1008
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:31,290
I mean every single person
who has ever walked through

1009
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,130
that door and given a damn.

1010
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,140
Okay?

1011
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,920
Hey, hey, hey!

1012
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,590
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Someone-- there's someone here.

1013
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,550
I came here
with a speech

1014
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,630
about an illegal occupation

1015
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:04,010
and its devastating effects
on civilians in Chechnya.

1016
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,770
But in the last 48 hours,
I have received evidence

1017
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:12,020
that confirms systematic
mass killings

1018
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,150
on a scale
I could never imagine.

1019
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:21,990
The site contains over
a 150 murdered civilians,

1020
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,990
many of whom were found
with their hands tied

1021
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,990
behind their backs
with barbed wire

1022
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,660
and many showing
signs of torture.

1023
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:33,670
We expect many more
mass graves to be found.

1024
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:38,250
Now, the Kremlin is doing
everything possible

1025
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,550
to keep this a secret.

1026
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:44,090
It wants the world to believe
that Russia is waging a war

1027
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:48,310
against terrorists,
when in fact

1028
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:54,020
its real purpose is
a dedicated campaign of genocide

1029
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:56,020
against the people of Chechnya.

1030
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,360
Yes, sir. I saw it.

1031
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,570
Understood, sir.

1032
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,830
Yes, thank you.

1033
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,540
People can pay
with their lives

1034
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,340
for saying out loud
what they believe.

1035
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,140
Just talking to me
can put someone in danger.

1036
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,560
Where is he?

1037
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,020
He's not here.

1038
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,190
No. No, no, no.
He's not here.

1039
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,230
He's in Regita.

1040
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,440
Come back.
He's not here!

1041
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,570
Where are you going?

1042
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,870
Oh my God. Leave him. Leave him.

1043
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:53,960
Don't go after him.

1044
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,080
Leave him alone!

1045
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,460
Please!

1046
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,640
On your knees.

1047
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,990
Mm.

1048
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,540
Hey, The Godfather's on
in a bit.

1049
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,870
Ah. Well, shame we'll miss it.

1050
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,380
Well, we could always
get room service,

1051
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,630
stay in like the old days.

1052
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,250
Well, um,
and when they ask me

1053
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,880
why I didn't turn up
to receive my award,

1054
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,510
I'll say, "Oh.

1055
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:49,090
Well, there was an old movie
on the TV

1056
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,510
- and I wanted to watch."
- It's not an old movie.

1057
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,010
It's The Godfather.

1058
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:57,390
You love The Godfather.
I've just been pretending to.

1059
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,730
Now, get ready.

1060
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,030
Hi.

1061
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,070
Anzor has been arrested.

1062
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,030
What?

1063
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,790
They have taken my son.

1064
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,750
Well, where have they taken him?

1065
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,670
What?

1066
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,220
What?

1067
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,930
Everything all right?

1068
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,230
Let's go.

1069
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,240
Yeah.

1070
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,280
Thank you.

1071
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,330
No, it's not like the old days,
is it?

1072
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,870
When we started out,
if you won an award,

1073
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:00,960
you had to get yourself killed

1074
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,580
or at least, lose a couple
of legs or something, right?

1075
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,630
They'd put a picture up
on the newsroom

1076
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,260
of a coffee machine that said,
"Never to be forgotten."

1077
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,970
Next person in they'd be,
"Who's that?"

1078
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:10,630
Right?

1079
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:13,930
And now for the final award
of the evening.

1080
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,140
The Global Award
for Human Rights Journalism

1081
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:19,140
was established to recognize
the immense importance

1082
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,810
of journalists around the world.

1083
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:26,440
This year, the award
goes to Anna Politkovskaya.

1084
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,610
Yeah!

1085
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,150
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1086
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,870
War has two sides.

1087
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,460
I say it has three.

1088
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,750
The innocent civilians
caught in the middle

1089
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:48,750
of what I can only describe
as a medieval, brutal war.

1090
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,430
And I would like
to dedicate this award

1091
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:57,310
to those extraordinary,
brave people.

1092
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,520
Sorry, if I embarrassed
you, all right?

1093
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,770
I'd had a few glasses of wine.

1094
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,480
Oh, good, Sasha.
Blame the wine.

1095
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,690
Jesus, everybody
loved you, all right?

1096
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:11,190
Everybody loved your speech.

1097
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,280
How long are you gonna stay
angry for?

1098
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,160
Look, it's stained on it--

1099
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,280
No, this is not about the dress!

1100
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,530
- With the water.
- This...

1101
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,660
this is about you

1102
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,200
and how you wallow
in your self-pity.

1103
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,580
Oh, uh, uh, uh,
when I try and help you,

1104
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,960
you resent me like you
resent everything I do.

1105
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,130
I have no idea
what you're--

1106
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:32,470
- what are you talking about?
- Look, you-- you were a star.

1107
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,550
You got the treatment everywhere
you went, including at home.

1108
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,850
And then
the unthinkable happened.

1109
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,810
Your wife stopped
playing second fiddle.

1110
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:43,180
Yeah, the-- this,
it's so far from the mark.

1111
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,980
- It is so wrong.
- I'm right!

1112
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,230
Yeah. Uh, you're right
about anything.

1113
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,360
I mean, you're always fucking
right about everything,

1114
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,230
aren't you?

1115
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,490
I mean, you're right
about not liking sitting

1116
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,860
at home doing nothing.
You're right.

1117
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:57,910
I don't like sitting about
with nothing to do for years.

1118
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:01,540
And whose fault is that?

1119
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:04,660
Uh, it's not mine, is it?

1120
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,500
- Obviously--
- I mean, is it?

1121
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,460
- It's not.
- So...

1122
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,790
So, you're blaming me like
you blame me for everything.

1123
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,710
Who the fuck else is to blame?

1124
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,300
- No.
- No, I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

1125
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:20,390
Look, Sasha, Sasha, I--
I don't care anymore.

1126
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,300
May I take your bag, sir?

1127
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,340
Yes, please.

1128
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,560
I um, I spoke to Vasily.

1129
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,400
He's gonna let me crash there
just for a little while.

1130
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,150
That's good for Vasily.

1131
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,360
How long you sticking around?

1132
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,320
I think a few more days.

1133
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,070
There's people here.

1134
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,330
I, uh...

1135
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,170
Listen...

1136
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,960
you're a better writer
than me.

1137
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,760
I know that's not easy
for you to say.

1138
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,830
Hello?

1139
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,370
They uh, beat him...

1140
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,130
and then left him to die
like a piece of rubbish.

1141
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,710
Oh, Maaret.

1142
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,920
They've taken everything.

1143
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,680
A brother, my husband,
my children.

1144
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,220
That's all war does, takes.

1145
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,930
And it's never enough.

1146
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:14,060
Two centuries of taking,
it still wants more.

1147
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,440
I'm so sorry.

1148
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,080
You know,
if you two do get tired

1149
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,300
of watching this extremely
long costume drama

1150
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,460
in which literally nothing
actually happens,

1151
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:25,130
I think there's
a football game on.

1152
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,640
No?

1153
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:30,970
Okay.

1154
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:35,140
No one is reporting
on the terrible impact

1155
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,060
of the war.

1156
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,310
The tactics employed
by the Kremlin

1157
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:42,940
to suppress so-called terrorism

1158
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:45,990
is itself creating a wave
of violence

1159
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:49,740
the like of which
has never been experienced.

1160
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,120
Get the fuck off the stage!

1161
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,540
Move it fucking now!

1162
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,100
You're all going to die

1163
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,470
unless you do exactly as we say.

1164
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,270
Call your loved ones.

1165
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:20,440
Tell them
you have been taken hostage

1166
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,770
by the Reconnaissance
and Sabotage Battalion

1167
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,190
of Vedeno.

1168
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,160
Right, does anyone
want anything?

1169
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,910
- I'm good, thank you.
- Ilya?

1170
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:44,170
Nikolai Agapov reporting live

1171
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:46,880
from the Dubrovka Theater
in Moscow,

1172
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,260
which has been taken over
by Chechen terrorists.

1173
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,510
- Oh my God.
- ...to detonate bombs.

1174
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,300
Just after 9:00 p.m.
this evening,

1175
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,810
- dozens of heavily--
- Turn it down.

1176
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:56,930
...Chechens stormed
the theater--

1177
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:58,180
So, who is this?

1178
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,980
Egorov, the Russian Federation.

1179
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,690
What do you want?

1180
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,980
I'm calling to tell you
what the terrorists want.

1181
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,150
And that is?

1182
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,280
You.

1183
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,650
Me?

1184
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:12,320
Yeah, to mediate negotiations.

1185
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,580
According to their leader,
you're the only Russian

1186
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,580
that the entire Chechen
population trusts.

1187
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:21,120
I need you to come to the
Dubrovka Theater immediately.

1188
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,620
When you get there,
you will ask for me,

1189
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,040
and one of my men
will escort you

1190
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,590
to the command center.

1191
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,630
Okay.

1192
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:29,550
Mama?

1193
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,350
They um, they want me
to help with negotiations.

1194
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,020
Over the phone, right?

1195
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,140
No.

1196
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,690
- Oh my God.
- A woman in her 40s

1197
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:49,150
murdered while attending
a theater show.

1198
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,160
So, these are the people you're
supposed to talk sense to?

1199
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,910
A-- a-- and you're supposed
to go in there and do what?

1200
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,330
Make them see the fucking light?

1201
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:03,540
Ilya, if there's anything
I can do to help, then I will.

1202
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,800
Of course.

1203
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:10,630
That's all I've ever
heard my entire life.

1204
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:12,470
The innocent,
and the powerless

1205
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:13,970
- and how much they need you.
- Ilya, Ilya.

1206
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,470
- Yeah, it never ends, ma.
- Ilya, Ilya, listen to me.

1207
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,720
No, because this is the world!

1208
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,480
And the world will never run out
of victims no matter what you

1209
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,560
or anyone else does
to change it.

1210
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,520
So tell me, mama,
where do we fit in?

1211
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,570
- So, no, no--
- This is not about you!

1212
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,690
So, tell me!

1213
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,860
I mean, granted, we're only
your flesh and blood, right?

1214
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,530
Yeah, we're not full fucking
members of the Wretched

1215
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:34,570
- and Exploited--
- Oh.

1216
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,160
- Ilya, I--
- No, no.

1217
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:42,870
Ilya.

1218
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,290
You're not going.

1219
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,710
You're not.

1220
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:50,880
You're staying right here.

1221
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:52,670
- It's her choice.
- No, no.

1222
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,800
I'm not watching you die!

1223
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,220
Listen to yourself.

1224
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,350
Mama, please be careful.

1225
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,690
I've sent Marta
and the metro team.

1226
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,280
I'd love to assign you,
but it looks like you're busy.

1227
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,320
Now do me a favor,
try not to piss anyone off.

1228
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,700
I know it's hard for you.

1229
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,080
Oh, I'll try.

1230
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,710
You'll never get a cab.

1231
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,680
That was a friend in DC,
it's all over the news there.

1232
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,510
My contact in London
says the same.

1233
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,470
Well done, lads.
You hit them big time.

1234
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,820
Why are you doing this?

1235
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,160
You're not a parent.

1236
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,580
Maybe someday
you'll have children

1237
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,950
and-- and when you do,

1238
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,580
your children
will look at the world

1239
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,620
that you have handed them

1240
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:11,630
and-- and they will judge you,
not whether you,

1241
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:14,300
you succeeded in making
the world a better place

1242
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,590
or didn't make the world
a better place,

1243
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:17,510
but it...

1244
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,390
They will judge you
on how hard you tried.

1245
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,540
This is as far as I go.

1246
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,250
Said I'd take you to them,
but I'm not handing you over.

1247
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,840
Go, mama.

1248
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,830
No one interrupt.

1249
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,960
Sir?

1250
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,760
Thank you for coming, Anna.

1251
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,090
So, you're not going in there
to report or observe.

1252
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,390
No public statements,
no interviews.

1253
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:48,140
You keep your mouth shut
and you keep your opinions

1254
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,680
to yourself
until the situation is resolved.

1255
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:54,600
And then I'm free to say
whatever I like, hmm?

1256
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,900
Lieutenant Colonel Egorov.

1257
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,940
Well, that's entirely up to you.

1258
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,150
The leader's name
is Musa Barayev,

1259
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,660
a well-established
Chechen separatist.

1260
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:09,200
We estimate 30-plus terrorists
and 800 hostages.

1261
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,040
The children are still inside,

1262
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,710
getting them out
should be your main priority.

1263
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:17,340
We've also been able to tap
into the theater's CCTV cameras,

1264
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,420
mainly focused on the entrances
and exits,

1265
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:22,630
so we should have visual
on you most of the time.

1266
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:26,300
But if anything does go wrong,
there's not a lot we can do.

1267
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,760
Oh, we have a flak jacket.

1268
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,720
There's no need.

1269
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,890
They've killed two
hostages already.

1270
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,480
They're savages.

1271
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,730
You trust savages?

1272
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:37,230
Well, if they are savages,
then a flak jacket

1273
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:39,150
isn't gonna be much help
to me, is it?

1274
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,860
Shall we?

1275
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,110
Ma'am.

1276
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:13,430
She's going in.

1277
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:17,310
She's completely alone.

1278
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:18,560
She'll be fine.

1279
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,410
How much time do your men need?

1280
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,670
Two to three hours.

1281
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,210
Copy, she's in.

1282
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,850
Give the order.

1283
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:50,720
Sir.

1284
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,030
Hello?

1285
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:11,870
Hello?

1286
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:12,910
Hello.

1287
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:19,370
I am Abu Bakr.

1288
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,330
I'm Anna.

1289
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,090
It is an honor to meet you,
Anna Politkovskaya.

1290
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,050
Back home they write songs
about you.

1291
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:30,140
One claims you are the
bravest woman in Russia.

1292
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,680
I'm here to see Barayev.

1293
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:33,810
Of course.

1294
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:35,810
Come with me.

1295
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,050
What the fuck? What--
what the fuck is this shit?

1296
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,970
Are you guys stupid?

1297
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:09,840
Take this...

1298
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,800
Fucking imbeciles.

1299
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:18,890
Tell your readers
we are not jihadists, okay,

1300
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,810
in spite of what some would
have you believe.

1301
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,860
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1302
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,570
They're children under 13.

1303
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,360
You made a deal.

1304
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,780
You need to let them go.

1305
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:35,490
Okay.

1306
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:37,700
Okay.

1307
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,330
All children under 13 years old,

1308
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:42,580
line up on the stairs
with me now.

1309
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,320
- Is this your wife?
- Yeah, she's diabetic.

1310
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,030
- There we go.
- Thank you.

1311
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:17,030
Children.

1312
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,240
Come.

1313
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:59,580
We've gone past the point
of no return.

1314
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:03,710
Either the war stops now
or we blow up the hostages.

1315
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:04,620
Well--

1316
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:07,170
And that's your message?

1317
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:09,960
Look, I understand.

1318
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,550
I know the situation
in Chechnya is intolerable.

1319
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,430
Let me help you make a deal.

1320
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,600
There must be an immediate halt
to all security sweeps.

1321
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:32,320
If he agrees,
the older children can go.

1322
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:36,070
And what's to stop him resuming
sweeps in two days, huh?

1323
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:41,330
If you let the children go,
it's a gesture, Abu Bakr,

1324
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:43,790
and I'm telling you,
it's an important one.

1325
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,700
She wants to talk to you.

1326
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:17,950
Thank you.

1327
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:25,700
He says you need to call off
the security sweeps.

1328
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,870
First he releases those 13
and over,

1329
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:31,880
then I'll order a halt
in all districts except Vedeno.

1330
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,840
First, he says you have to let
the older children go.

1331
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:47,600
Anna.

1332
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:53,940
Fatima.

1333
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,690
Ah, we've come a long way.

1334
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,860
On very different paths.

1335
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,200
You choose words,
I choose action.

1336
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,450
These men...

1337
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,290
...they're using you.

1338
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:09,160
You're wrong.

1339
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,580
These are good men.

1340
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,540
They fight for a great cause.

1341
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,500
Your husband, if he was alive,
well, he would--

1342
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,590
would he stand with them?

1343
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,840
Men who prey on the vulnerable,
who--

1344
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,760
who give them no choice,
but what,

1345
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,640
to murder innocent people
in the name of what?

1346
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,510
Peace?

1347
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,100
Cover your face, Fatima.

1348
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,100
Leave with me now.

1349
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,730
Beg the court for mercy.

1350
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:36,230
It's the only way you're
gonna get out of here alive.

1351
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:44,740
All right.

1352
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:49,330
The rest of the children can go.

1353
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,120
And the women?

1354
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,040
Maybe.

1355
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,750
You need to go.

1356
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:59,710
And you need to keep on talking.

1357
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,800
Otherwise,
how is this going to end?

1358
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,220
When Chechnya is free.

1359
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,810
That's when this will end.

1360
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:10,810
Goodbye, Anna.

1361
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,780
What the--
No. What-- not that--

1362
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:05,280
No. Get, get--

1363
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,450
The fuck is going on?

1364
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:09,200
Alpha team
storming the building.

1365
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,040
Christ, the war has come home.

1366
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,130
What was that?

1367
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,510
No, what?

1368
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,770
- No, get, get--
- It's all right.

1369
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:33,980
- It's all right.
- Get off!

1370
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,310
Let her go.

1371
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:39,940
Wh--

1372
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:41,320
What the hell have you done?

1373
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,740
You used me.

1374
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:47,410
You used me to stall for time.

1375
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,700
We each have a job to do, Anna.

1376
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,080
We saved
a lot of innocent lives

1377
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,240
and a few Chechens
are put to sleep.

1378
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,830
Job well done.

1379
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:55,960
I understand it was
the president

1380
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,080
who came up with the idea,
but don't quote me.

1381
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,500
Look, you're maniacs.

1382
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,550
You're-- you're all
fucking maniacs.

1383
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,220
So, you're accusing

1384
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:59,230
the president of murder?

1385
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:01,230
Last month he ordered the use

1386
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:03,730
of chemical weapons
on civilians,

1387
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:05,530
a 170 people died.

1388
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,570
So, w-- w-- what, what
would you call it?

1389
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:10,450
It was an opioid-laced gas, correct?

1390
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,070
Fentanyl.

1391
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:13,830
A tranquilizer used
to make people fall asleep.

1392
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,080
Not to kill them.

1393
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,410
You see these people?

1394
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:21,370
Now, they're civilians,
not terrorists,

1395
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,210
and they are not sleeping.

1396
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:26,750
Fentanyl causes
respiratory depression.

1397
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,510
Now, the victims should have
been turned on their sides in--

1398
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,930
in order to keep
their airways open.

1399
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:34,050
Instead, they were left
on their backs,

1400
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:36,720
ensuring they asphyxiated.

1401
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,520
Now, as you can see,
the ER personnel

1402
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,850
are completely caught
by surprise

1403
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:43,650
at the number of victims
needing their care.

1404
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:46,770
Now, if they had been informed
ahead of time--

1405
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,030
- Wh-- why weren't they?
- Secrecy.

1406
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:52,410
See, our team uncovered

1407
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,280
that the operation
was classified

1408
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,660
under need-to-know restrictions.

1409
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:02,420
And that, well, then that
included people

1410
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,960
who could have saved lives.

1411
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,800
And the fact that 30 terrorists
took hundreds hostage?

1412
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,680
The only terrorist

1413
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,600
that the Russian people
need to fear...

1414
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,520
is their own president.

1415
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,760
You have to see this.

1416
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:53,720
Reports just coming in

1417
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,180
from the town of Beslan
in North Ossetia.

1418
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,390
The Chechen separatists
have entered the school

1419
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,310
and taken many hostages.

1420
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:03,480
It's a terrible reminder
of the Dubrovka Theater scene

1421
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,480
with hundreds of staff
and people still trapped inside.

1422
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,440
Oh, no.

1423
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,440
Anna, this is not your war.

1424
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:16,320
Uh, uh, listen, D-- Dmitry,
uh, someone needs to negotiate.

1425
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,780
I have to try.

1426
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:18,830
Last time I checked,

1427
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,740
you were supposed
to be a journalist.

1428
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:23,330
But-- but I-- I am
and you know that

1429
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:26,290
and why I need to be there
on the ground.

1430
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:28,290
Just be careful.

1431
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:35,050
My contact on the ground
will meet you

1432
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:36,630
and take you to the school.

1433
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,850
The government is saying
200 to 400 hostages,

1434
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:42,470
but my contact in Ossetia
is saying it's more like 1100,

1435
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,180
700 children.

1436
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,100
Good luck.

1437
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,270
Thank you.

1438
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,200
Be careful!

1439
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:02,950
Welcome aboard.

1440
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,370
Thank you.

1441
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:14,420
- Tea or coffee, madam?
- No, thank you.

1442
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:17,130
- Tea or coffee, madam?
- Tea, please.

1443
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:21,100
Your tea ma'am.

1444
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,810
Oh, thank you.

1445
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,250
Miss?

1446
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,170
Miss?

1447
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:58,220
Miss?

1448
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:35,920
Mama.

1449
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,050
Mama, you're awake.

1450
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:40,880
Here water, water.

1451
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,270
Ilya?

1452
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,600
Yeah, she's awake.

1453
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,520
Okay.

1454
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,730
Okay.

1455
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,820
Ilya's on his way.

1456
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,230
Okay, I'm gonna go
and get a nurse. Okay?

1457
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,650
Wha-- what happened?

1458
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,240
The hostages?

1459
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:05,950
Mum.

1460
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:08,910
What happened?

1461
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:20,720
The rebels set off a bomb
inside the gymnasium.

1462
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,800
That is if you
believe the Kremlin.

1463
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:29,430
There were casualties, mama.

1464
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:30,730
How many?

1465
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:35,560
The number keeps changing,
but...

1466
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:39,690
at the moment
they're saying over 300 dead.

1467
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:41,820
Huh?

1468
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:43,240
Including all the separatists.

1469
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,450
Huh?

1470
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:45,870
How many children?

1471
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,540
- Mama, you need to rest.
- Vera, how many children?

1472
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:57,500
The majority.

1473
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,690
You were right.

1474
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,320
You said she would
fight to live.

1475
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,160
God is great.

1476
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:39,420
Garry Kasparov
was on TV yesterday.

1477
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:42,090
He called you,
"the conscience of the nation".

1478
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:45,840
Yeah, well, Garry Kasparov
should stick to playing chess.

1479
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:48,260
Good morning.

1480
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,970
Have you seen this?

1481
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:04,940
Anna!

1482
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,660
I'm no saint.

1483
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,490
Far from it.

1484
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:13,410
Ask the mothers of Beslan.

1485
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:15,160
Well, don't tell them.

1486
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,870
Mother Russia.

1487
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:22,920
- Far from it.
- Anna!

1488
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:26,170
Anna!

1489
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:28,630
- Anna!
- Thank you.

1490
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,180
Anna! Anna! Anna!

1491
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,600
Okay, stay back please.
Stay back.

1492
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:40,860
- Anna!
- Anna!

1493
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,150
Excuse me, thank you.

1494
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:46,150
- Anna!
- Anna!

1495
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:47,610
Careful, careful.

1496
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:50,160
Anna! Anna! Anna!

1497
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,570
You all right?

1498
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,490
Yeah.

1499
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:54,370
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

1500
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,770
A reporter should
never be the story.

1501
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,480
I am not a politician.

1502
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:26,650
I am just another face
in the crowd in Moscow,

1503
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:30,650
St. Petersburg, and Chechnya,

1504
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:31,740
doing my job.

1505
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:37,620
And I do not intend to stop.

1506
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,960
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

1507
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,210
What are you doing tomorrow?

1508
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:46,210
Tomorrow?

1509
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:47,920
Planning on coming in to work.

1510
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,880
Why?

1511
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,470
Well, I was thinking
of taking the day off.

1512
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:53,220
You wanna join me?

1513
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,390
Okay.

1514
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:58,270
All right.

1515
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:03,270
Uh, 12:00,
the bandstand, Drewsbury Park.

1516
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,070
Right. See you then.

1517
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,020
See you there.

1518
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,320
Bye.

1519
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,220
My feet got fat.

1520
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,600
When was the last time
you wore them?

1521
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,150
Oh, 30 years ago.

1522
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:47,310
Used to go to Gorky Park
on Saturday afternoons

1523
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,610
to dance the cha-cha.

1524
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:51,570
What?

1525
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:53,030
- The cha-cha?
- Yeah, the cha-cha.

1526
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:56,030
I was quite a hoofer.

1527
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:56,870
Ask my wife.

1528
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:02,750
You know, I met
Sasha at a tea dance.

1529
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,290
- You're kidding.
- Mm.

1530
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:06,960
And he kept stepping on my feet.

1531
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,750
Luckily for him,
he was so good-looking.

1532
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:12,420
- You see, I like this.
- Hmm?

1533
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:13,970
We're hanging out.

1534
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,510
We never hang out.

1535
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:18,970
It's always work, work, work.

1536
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,440
Voulez-vous danser?

1537
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,200
All the other papers
have a travel writer.

1538
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,870
How come we don't?

1539
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,490
Because we can't afford one.

1540
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:41,330
Not according to our accountant.

1541
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:44,370
According to him, we've had
our best quarter ever,

1542
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,290
thanks to you.

1543
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:46,250
Mm.

1544
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,710
So, do you know anyone
who can write a bit

1545
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:54,420
and doesn't mind sleeping
in strange beds?

1546
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:59,260
What's wrong, Dima?

1547
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,890
Do you want me to stop
stepping on people's toes?

1548
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,480
They never come for me.

1549
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:11,900
All the years
I've been doing this,

1550
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:15,030
I've had plenty of threats,
but not once.

1551
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:16,150
They just...

1552
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:21,530
killed my reporters,
my friends.

1553
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,250
Anna, please.

1554
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,710
I'm not asking you to stop,

1555
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:29,960
just step out
of the firing line

1556
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,670
and you keep the column.

1557
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:36,510
You just shift the focus

1558
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:41,180
from murder and corruption
to bed and breakfasts.

1559
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,690
I'll think about it.

1560
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,520
Right.

1561
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,860
Natalya sent it.

1562
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:18,440
It's a video of two men
killing Chechen civilians,

1563
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:21,280
possibly on the order
of Chechen regional leaders

1564
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,780
or, or quite possibly
Putin himself.

1565
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:27,700
You'll need to authenticate it.

1566
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:33,120
I don't understand.

1567
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,630
Knock yourself out.

1568
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,630
But it's your lead.

1569
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:44,590
And you're ready.

1570
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:57,310
Hello?

1571
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,480
Egorov.

1572
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,240
Oh, h-- hi.

1573
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,740
I understand you wanna meet.

1574
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:06,910
Y-- yes.

1575
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,990
But in public.
I want lots of people around.

1576
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,620
As you wish.

1577
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:16,500
Tomorrow, 11:00,
the art museum.

1578
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,290
Um, o-- okay.

1579
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,260
I'll-- I'll-- I'll--
I'll see you then.

1580
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:23,380
Sleep well.

1581
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:24,680
Goodnight.

1582
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,280
Sorry, I'm late.

1583
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,870
There was a queue.

1584
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:52,120
Black tea, no sugar.

1585
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:02,420
You just wasted a perfectly
good untainted drink.

1586
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:05,800
And you almost wasted
a perfectly good reporter.

1587
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:09,390
Look, I know this may sound
disingenuous,

1588
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,680
but I am glad you're alive.

1589
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,270
So, that means I don't have
to worry

1590
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,100
about you putting another
wet team onto me?

1591
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,940
Not my call.

1592
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,690
Well, whose call is it?

1593
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,860
I can't answer that.

1594
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:22,940
Can't or won't?

1595
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:31,990
The reason I ask is
because I've been reassigned

1596
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:33,660
to the travel desk.

1597
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,870
That's why I'm asking you
to speak to someone for me.

1598
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,750
I can pass along
the information.

1599
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,960
Pass along wh--

1600
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,920
Look, I'm middle management.

1601
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:47,340
These decisions they, um...

1602
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,390
My mandate is circumscribed.

1603
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:53,430
Ah.

1604
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,640
In other words, I'm screwed.

1605
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,150
- I don't make the rules.
- No, you just follow them.

1606
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:00,900
So, can I ask you something?

1607
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,360
You know,

1608
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,480
out of all the paths
you could have chosen in life,

1609
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,530
why did you choose this one?

1610
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,900
I could ask you
the same question.

1611
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:11,240
Well, I chose the path
that I believe in.

1612
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,530
I didn't.

1613
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:17,580
You know all this,
this was a slum,

1614
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:21,080
until Ivan the Great kicked out
the residents

1615
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,710
and built a palace.

1616
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,670
Not because he was cruel,
but because he had a vision.

1617
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:31,130
He saw a shining city rising
from that hell hole,

1618
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:34,560
and beyond that,
a mighty empire

1619
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:37,600
straddling two continents.

1620
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:42,850
And here we are,
500 years later,

1621
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:45,900
a journalist pleading
for a life in a--

1622
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,820
in a country run
by a glorified thug,

1623
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:51,700
celebrating the opening
of its first Starbucks.

1624
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:56,240
I don't expect you
to understand.

1625
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:00,960
Do you have children?

1626
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,210
Why do you wanna know?

1627
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:12,090
No, I don't have any children.

1628
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:13,300
But you're married?

1629
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:17,140
I'm single.

1630
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:19,520
And in case you're wondering,
both my parents are dead.

1631
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,690
What's your point?

1632
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,110
So, you have no one?

1633
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,070
What you mean,
no one who gives a shit

1634
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:28,570
if I live or die?

1635
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:30,860
I'm...

1636
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:33,070
You what?

1637
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:34,990
Sorry.

1638
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:41,710
I'm on good terms
with the director,

1639
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,580
and he's on good terms
with someone

1640
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:47,340
who's in a position to help
you, so I'll make a request.

1641
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:50,590
Thank you.

1642
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:53,180
Goodbye, Anna.

1643
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:29,630
- Find anything?
- Mm.

1644
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:33,510
You?

1645
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,600
Oh.

1646
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:45,730
Oh.

1647
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:48,060
Don't yell.

1648
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,650
- Vera!
- Yeah?

1649
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,820
Oh.

1650
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,490
She's having a baby.

1651
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,990
Oh.

1652
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:04,660
Sasha, of course, I'd be happy
if it was a boy.

1653
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:07,120
Wouldn't you like
a granddaughter?

1654
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,250
Oh, well, girls--

1655
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:13,260
Yeah, well, they're sweeter,
especially when they're younger.

1656
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,590
I'll bet.

1657
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:15,590
I know I was.

1658
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:16,840
You still are.

1659
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,550
- God, we're old.
- Yeah.

1660
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:19,970
We're gonna be grandparents.

1661
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:20,890
I know.

1662
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,850
We should talk about it.

1663
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:22,760
- I mean--
- Okay.

1664
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,220
Like, get it right.
You know what I mean?

1665
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:25,390
Right. Oh.

1666
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:26,430
You want me
to get me off the phone?

1667
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,150
I got a lot of shopping,
Sasha, that's why.

1668
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:29,560
You mean fur coats?

1669
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:30,560
No.

1670
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:33,230
Well, Ilya's coming for dinner
this evening

1671
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:35,280
- with his new girlfriend.
- No.

1672
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,950
- I know.
- Oh God.

1673
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,910
- Are you cooking up a feast?
- Yeah, Vera's coming, too.

1674
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:39,660
Great.

1675
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:40,780
Why don't you come?

1676
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:41,950
- What time?
- 8:00.

1677
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:42,910
- All right, great.
- Yeah.

1678
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:44,200
- Yeah, I'd love it.
- Okay.

1679
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,620
I'll bring some wine, yeah?

1680
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,710
- Yeah. Well--
- Okay, love.

1681
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,750
Okay. I'll see you then.
Bye, bye.

1682
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,080
Bye.

1683
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:54,800
Oh.

1684
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:17,150
Let go.

1685
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:19,660
- Let go.
- No!

1686
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:33,500
Is journalism worth
the loss of life every time?

1687
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:38,550
Is the price of truth
how much a society cares?

1688
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:40,890
No.

1689
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:45,680
There is nothing of value
apart from the truth.
