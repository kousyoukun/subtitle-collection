00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:51,900
Merry Christmas, bud. Thank
you. Merry Christmas to you.

4
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,901
Okay.
Hi, chief.

5
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:45,553
Come in.

6
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,555
Hello, honey.

7
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:53,052
Well, this is our last night in
show business. Some feeling, huh?

8
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:56,894
Some feeling. I got the
ring and the license.

9
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,695
Honey, we're ready.
Oh.

10
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:03,260
Say, there's a hook leftover
at the top here. Should that be?

11
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:06,774
Never mind that, dear.
I'll take care of it.

12
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,003
Jim.
Huh?

13
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:14,846
Well, I think that
tie is terrible.

14
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:19,445
Well, who cares? Tomorrow I'm a
farmer. You'd better go change it.

15
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:23,457
Listen, honey, when you flip on those twinkle
toes, who's going to be looking at my tie?

16
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:28,087
You only have five minutes.
Hurry. Okay, I'm on my way.

17
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,978
What'd he say?
I didn't tell him.

18
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:47,914
Why not? We love each other.
You want to continue dancing.

19
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:50,451
I know, but...
he gets a look.

20
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,353
Oh, he's always had that look. It
doesn't mean anything emotionally.

21
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:58,154
It has to do with his liver.
Tell him you've made a mistake.

22
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:01,355
You don't want to give up
your career and live on a farm.

23
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,298
But he's already bought the farm
and the license and the ring.

24
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,063
Oh, I can't tell him.

25
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:11,162
All right. I will.
Right after our number.

26
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,607
Listen, darling, don't weaken.
Think of our life together.

27
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:18,737
Think of diamonds, of sables,
of your own little penthouse.

28
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:23,649
Is that a promise? Well, just
think about them for the time being.

29
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,779
<i Ready, Miss
Dixon. Oh, thank you.

30
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:30,256
This thing didn't come
out even. Oh, I'll fix it.

31
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:34,022
We have to hurry.
I love you.

32
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:37,657
I love you...
and Jim.

33
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:42,397
I loveJim too. But after all,

Not much of a Christmas
present for you, is it?

66
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:09,701
I mean, both of us
walking out on you.

67
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:13,804
Don't worry about me, kid.
I'll do all right. What a chump.

68
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:19,114
Can't you see what we're walking
out on? The grind, 365 days a year.

69
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:22,849
When was the last time you had a day
off? I don't know. Maybe last year.

70
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:26,950
Did you ever hear ofThanksgiving
or Labor Day or the Fourth ofJuly?

71
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:29,257
Vaguely. You know what
they are, don't you?

72
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,197
They're holidays, days of
rest. There's lots of'em.

73
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,996
They mark 'em in red on the
calendar so you can't miss 'em.

74
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:40,006
What happens in show business when a holiday comes along?
You give an extra performance.

75
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:44,101
Not for me, brother. Lila and I are
going up to that farm in Connecticut.

76
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,942
<i>We're gonna liv
by the calendar.</i>

77
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:51,383
<i>Say, Jim, uh... there's something
you should know. Hmm?</i>

78
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:54,216
Oh, I know, Ted. I feel
the same way about you.

79
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:57,917
You know, we've had
our ups and our downs.

80
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:00,552
We've fought a little over
women, but... I know, but...

81
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,823
Sorry, Jimmy boy,
but that's life.

82
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:06,628
If I'm not the best manager in the
business, I'll eat a mechanic's shirt.

83
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,965
Fifteen weeks at the Park Club,
sight unseen, for you and Lila.

84
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:14,633
Two hundred dollars a week more than you
were getting with the farmer thrown in.

85
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:19,407
What's the matter?
I haven't told him.

86
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,539
You haven't told him?
You haven't told him?

87
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:24,083
Haven't told me what?
What's the news?

88
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:27,678
Well, don't be upset, Jim dear.
It isn't that I don't love you.

89
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,724
I do.
I love everybody.

90
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,760
But when Ted explained
how much he loved me and...

91
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:37,263
All at once we both realized
that we belonged together.

92
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:39,390
The two of us,
dedicating our lives...

93
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:43,266
to making people happy with
our feet. The two of you, huh?

94
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:46,795
Dedicating your lives to making
people happy with your feet.

95
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:51,174
That's sweet. Well, I guess that
kick I just got was a good start, huh?

96
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:53,338
Sorry, Jimmy boy,
but that's life.

97
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:56,906
It's best you found out now. You
wouldn't want to make Lila unhappy.

98
00:09:56,984 --> 00:10:00,147
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't
want to make Lila unhappy.

99
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:03,588
Not now, now that I
really know her.

100
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:07,991
What a narrow squeak that was.

101
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:12,863
What do you mean by that? Oh,
nothing, honey. I'm happy you're happy.

102
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:16,699
That little speech sounds like
the crackle of confederate money.

103
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,171
Well, kids, I'm still
going to rejoin the human race.

104
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,404
I hope you get a lot of work,
holidays included.

105
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,071
Dance yourselves into
beautiful nervous breakdowns.

Oh, but this can't miss. I'm
turning the farm into an inn!

130
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:51,223
But what an inn.
Here, read up, brother.

"Holiday Inn.
Midville, Connecticut.

132
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:57,594
"Get off the highway
and relax on a farm.

133
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:01,062
Dancing, entertainment, home
cooking. Open holidays only."

134
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:04,170
Open holidays only? How many
of those are there? Mm-hmm.

135
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:06,263
Oh, there's about 15.

136
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,276
That gives me 350 days a year to kick
around in. You would think of that.

137
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:13,211
Did you get your discharge
from that sanitarium?

138
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,081
Oh, don't you worry. This is going to
work. I'm having auditions every day.

139
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:21,679
If you run into any talent,
will you send 'em out?

140
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:23,985
Sure, as soon as I get back.

141
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:28,153
I'm flying down to Miami Beach tonight to
set an engagement for Ted and Lila. Lila.

142
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:30,025
You forgot the flowers.

143
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:32,588
Don't get excited. There's a
flower shop out at the airport.

144
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,157
I guarantee to have orchids
before her first number.

145
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:39,695
Boy, you'd better. This kid even
expects presents on Father's Day.

146
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,674
Well, good luck, Jim.
So long, Ted.

147
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:46,611
Have a nice trip. I mean,
yeah, thanks, I will.

148
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,182
That reminds me,
I forgot to give him...

149
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,945
a little Christmas
remembrance I brought along.

150
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,146
Got one here for each of you.

151
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:58,679
Say, this is swell.
What is it?

152
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:02,956
Homemade peach preserves. I put 'em up
myself before I went into the sanitarium.

153
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,293
Boy, do I go for those!

154
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:08,822
Why, they're great on...
on, uh... or even plain.

155
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:11,369
They're nonfattening too.

156
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:14,133
Well, it's a long trip.
I think I'll get along.

157
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,176
Will you say hello to Lila for
me? You've got to catch the act.

158
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:22,180
We've got some new routines.
And then after the show...

159
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,721
I don't think they like
this nightclub air.

160
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:40,825
Wait. You'd better
wait for Lila's.

161
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,273
I think Danny's was the
loudest. It was a different tone.

162
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:57,107
Dawn patrol, huh?

163
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:04,249
Hello.
Am I too late?

164
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:07,588
You would've been
in another minute.

165
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:11,697
Danny Reed.

166
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,528
Listen, I have to wait
on that man. But, uh...

167
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:21,164
I'll work five nights free. Anything.
Just leave me alone and don't butt in.

168
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:27,170
What would you like? Orchids.
The finest you've got.

169
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:30,010
Corsage?
No, no, a dozen.

170
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:32,846
Loose, looking like
they don't care.

171
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,480
All right. There. "Lila... love, Ted."

172
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:41,050
<i>Have them delivered to Miss Lila Dixon
at the Club Pierre before 11:00.</i>

173
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,563
Oh, I'm sorry, but our delivery
truck is on its last trip...

174
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,155
and won't be back
until after 11:00.

175
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,360
How about a messenger boy?

176
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:53,371
It's impossible to guarantee
delivery this late on Christmas Eve.

177
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,273
But to help you out, I'll
take them. Oh, there you are.

178
00:15:57,343 --> 00:16:00,801
A dozen orchids, please.
Lady, you're a lifesaver.

179
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,372
Here. Here's $5.00. Take your
boyfriend out and show him a good time.

180
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,577
Let's consider this
a personal favor.

181
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:09,382
Well, I can't leave town
indebted to a stranger.

182
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:12,219
Would you like to see the floor
show at the club? I'd like to, but...

183
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,725
Now you just give
this card to Francois,

184
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:19,663
and he'll seat you at the entertainer's
table. Why, you're Mr. Reed!

185
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:22,132
Uh-oh.
I'm Linda Mason.

186
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:25,193
This is a part-time job.
Actually, I sing and dance.

187
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:29,002
Mr. Reed, I want... I know, I know. You've
studied dancing since you were a child.

188
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,873
You spent long, weary hours
in every agency on Broadway.

189
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:34,777
But just now I happen to be
catching a plane to Mi...

190
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:39,648
Once you told me I was no good, I could get
a job in a bargain basement and like it.

191
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,449
Now look, honestly,
as soon as I get...

192
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,888
Oh, of course, sure.
You worked hard.

193
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,984
You want a chance. So what?
So I'm going to give it to you.

194
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:52,997
Ajob? Uh-huh. A friend of mine is opening
a place in Connecticut: Holiday Inn.

195
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:57,729
You take that card out there, tell
him I sent you and you'll be all set.

196
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:00,704
Mr. Reed, how could I
possibly thank you? Don't.

197
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:04,436
Just deliver those orchids
and let me catch my plane.

198
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:23,460
This table's reserved
for the band. Excuse me!

199
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,089
Fussy, isn't he?

200
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,602
I think I'll have
a bowl of coffee, huh?

201
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:35,340
And the lady?
Coffee.

202
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:56,917
- We seem to be on the 40-cent
tour here. - It is embarrassing.

203
00:17:56,996 --> 00:18:00,432
I'm Jim Hardy.
Linda Mason.

204
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:05,198
Got a friend in the show? Well,
I'm here at Mr. Reed's invitation.

205
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:09,230
Oh, Danny.
Then you know Ted Hanover?

206
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:12,744
Why, yes, naturally.

207
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:16,270
Oh, my. He's quite a man
with the ladies, that Ted.

208
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:21,285
Well, after all, he's a very
attractive man. Do you know him?

209
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:26,518
Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, I've been
considering Ted and his partner for my new club.

210
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:29,789
- Oh, you have a place?
- Oh, yes, yes.

211
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:34,356
I don't know though. His act might not
go so well in a place as large as mine.

212
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:38,767
Well, I've found that the size
of a place doesn't matter...

213
00:18:38,838 --> 00:18:41,500
if one has
sufficient personality.

214
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:45,772
That's what you've found, huh?
You in show business?

215
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,245
Oh... I'm Linda Mason.

216
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:51,249

242
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,470
Who?
Ted and Lila.

243
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:09,206
Hey, what's the matter?

244
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,738
Hello, Lila. How are you? Jimmy
boy! I'm so glad to see you.

245
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:16,309
I thought you were alone. Who's
your friend and what's her hurry?

246
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:19,584
- Don't ask me. She's your friend.
- Mine?

247
00:22:19,657 --> 00:22:23,024
- What is she afraid of, facing me?
- Darling, I swear I never...

248
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:26,996
"Darling, I swear." You lie. If
you don't... You're on. Take a bow.

249
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,496
<i>Encore!</i>

250
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:53,888
So this is Holiday Inn.

251
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,449
Yeah, will be
if it ever opens up.

252
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:59,826
Why shouldn't it open? I ain't
one to talk, but you could buy...

253
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:02,832
a half interest in this
place for a barrel of apples.

254
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,631
Next train for New York's at
7:43 if we can flag her down.

255
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:15,875
Say, I'm looking for a job.
Where's the boss?

256
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:19,678
Right here. I'll
be down in a second.

257
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:27,086
So you're the big shot
that didn't know whether...

258
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:30,093
Hanover and Dixon were
good enough for your place.

259
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:34,359
That wasn't exactly hay you were
throwing, either. "I'm Linda Mason."

260
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:37,492
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

261
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:40,435
All right, you're a fake and I'm
a phony. And we're both soaked.

262
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:42,598
Are you hurt?
I'll check later.

263
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:46,473
Come on, let's get out of this
before you catch cold. All right. Oh!

264
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,808
Well, here's what cooks.
Oh!

265
00:23:51,883 --> 00:23:56,820
<i>Why, this is darling. Was it as large
as this when it was a farmhouse?</i>

266
00:23:56,888 --> 00:24:01,188
Yeah, it was built by a fellow who felt cramped in New York.
He ran out of lumber, though.

267
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,786
<i>- Oh, Mamie!
- Coming!</i>

268
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,269
<i>Is your names Mamie? No. No.</i>

269
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:15,237
Get back in the kitchen.

270
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:22,574
My, my, what's happened?
Oh, we had a little accident.

271
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:25,013
Mamie, this is Miss Linda
Mason. How do you do?

272
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,711
Pleased to know you, Miss Linda.
And these are her children.

273
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:32,051
<i>There's Daphne and there's
Vanderbilt. How do you do?</i>

274
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:34,421
Mamie, will you take Miss Mason
up to the guest room...

275
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:37,017
and change her into anything
that'll fit her?

276
00:24:37,095 --> 00:24:39,495
Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.

277
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:42,260
I'll see about getting a fire
ready in the living room.

278
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:46,901
Is your names Miss Linda?

279
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:50,099
No.
No.

280
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:02,515
<i>I don't know. It sounds like
something you'd dream about at night.</i>

281
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:06,853
<i>It would be wonderful. Then you'd wake
up and realize it couldn't work.</i>

282
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,688
Oh, it'll work if I can sell
the idea to some performers.

283
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,354
They seem to think that profit
sharing means taking bows...

284
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,490
on an empty stomach. So that's
why you're not open tonight.

285
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:19,559
Well, I'm also particular about
the kind of talent I'm going to use.

286
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:23,906
<i>Fifteen holidays a year.
Mm-hmm.</i>

287
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:26,705
You're a lazy fellow.
No, not especially.

288
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,405
Just have my own ideas
about living.

289
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,076
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.

290
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:37,121
Never amounted to much,
didn't care.

291
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:41,522
But as long as he was alive, we always had
plenty to eat and clothes to keep us warm.

292
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,526
Were you happy?
Yes.

293
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:47,758
Then your father was a very
successful man. Hope I can do as well.

294
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:50,926
I came out here for a job.
Could you use me?

295
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:54,028
I might find a spot for you.
What can you do?

296
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:56,539
Oh, I sing a little and dance.

297
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,041
Couldn't guarantee
any salary at first.

298
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,635
Right now I've got
the ledger in an iron lung.

299
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:05,112
I don't care if you pay off in eggs. Just
give me a chance. Let's see what you can do.

300
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:08,745
Thanks a lot. I've written
special music for each holiday.

301
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:12,050
This gives me a chance to keep a
little promise I made to myself.

302
00:26:12,123 --> 00:26:15,286
I said I was going to sing
this song at the inn tonight.

No!

366
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:39,808
Francois, have you seen
Mr. Hanover? Twice, sir.

367
00:31:39,883 --> 00:31:42,181
What happened?
The first time, sir,

368
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:44,777
he came from his room with
a telegram in his hand.

369
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:49,291
He ordered scotch and soda, a
bottle of each. I know. What then?

370
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,022
The second time, he asked
which way is "Connect-I-cut."

371
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:55,064
Connecticut.
"Connect-I-cut."

372
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:57,964
He said he has a friend there
who knows about women too.

373
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,093
Why didn't you stop him?

374
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:04,071
How could I stop him, sir, when I
don't know which way is "Connect-I-cut"?

375
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,007
Who said Holiday Inn
wouldn't work?

376
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:11,877
We're gonna divvy up a stack
of money tonight, huh? Man, man!

377
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:14,815
I've got a landlady who's gonna
ask for your autographed picture.

379
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,251
All right, go to bed now.
It's gettin' late. Good night.

405
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:09,690

Come on, Jim, you gotta dance.

406
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:13,065
Oh, you gotta dance with me. Come
on, you gotta dance. No, I can't. Oh!

407
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:47,263
<i>Why, Mr. Hanover!
That's Ted Hanover.</i>

408
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:51,136
Wait a minute. I gotta go.
I don't want Ted Hanover.

409
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:54,665
I want you. This is
New Year's, kid. I know.

00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:19,316
Ted!

411
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:22,619
He wasn't drunk. It's
a gag. What happened?

412
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:25,627
Ted Hanover with his new
partner. They were great!

413
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:27,720
New partner?

414
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:37,706
You'd better get back. I'm
sorry. If I'd known how he was...

415
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:41,709
Oh, he'll be all right in a week
or ten days. You'd better hurry.

416
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:52,118
Ted! Ted!

417
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:56,420
Ted! Oh. How is he?

418
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:58,426
He's out cold.

419
00:37:58,494 --> 00:38:01,758
Hot or cold, he can keep
his dancing shoes in my office.

420
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,526
Did you hear that applause?
Yeah, it went pretty good.

421
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,330
And I was worried about his
losing Lila. Losing Lila?

422
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:11,429
Yeah, she eloped tonight
with some Texan from Texas...

423
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,974
with Ted's engagement ring
on her finger.

424
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:18,103
But who cares? You lose one girl,
you find another. That's life.

425
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,172
That's good, huh?
Here we go again.

426
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:36,488
Come in! Oh.

427
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,624
Good morning, Ted.
Good mor... Ooh.

428
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:43,364
Got a little head?
Say, where am I?

429
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:46,965
You're in Holiday Inn. How'd
I get here? Who brought me?

430
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:50,341
You were clinging to the
undercarriage of a jeep, I think.

431
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,313
Here, have a slug
out of the mug.

432
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:57,010
You mean, you don't
remember anything? Uh...

433
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:01,044
let's see,
I had a wire from Lila...

434
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:04,057
telling me she was gonna marry
some millionaire or something.

435
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,288
Yeah. I remember that all
right. Uh, then I had a drink.

436
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:10,126
<i>A drink?
Boy, you were fractured.</i>

437
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:15,135
And then, uh, I decided
I had to talk to my old palJim.

438
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:18,104
You don't remember anything
else? No, that's all.

439
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:22,234
Except that I... must have been killed
on the way out here or something.

440
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,474
You really come up empty, huh?
Too bad about Lila.

441
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:29,642
I think you're better off doing
a single. You're a born soloist.

442
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:32,278
Oh, no, no, Jim. I've got to have
a partner. And when I find her...

443
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:34,754
Yeah, I know, you'll
fall in love with her.

444
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:37,587
Happy New Year!
Oh, don't do that.

445
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:40,423
Why didn't you tell me?

446
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:42,827
Letting me worry
about his losing Lila,

447
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:45,798
and all the time he's got
this girl on the leash.

448
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:49,462
What girl?
Boy, you must've been high.

449
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:53,234
Doing a complete dance routine
with your new partner and you...

450
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,334
You don't know who she is?

451
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:59,744
I danced with a new partner?
When? Where?

452
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,443
Here! Last night!
Think, Ted.

453
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:05,645
Remember?

454
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,451
<i>Wait a minute I remember.</i>

455
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:13,620
<i>I got here just about midnight.
There was a girl.</i>

456
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:17,054
We danced.

457
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:19,327
What'd she look like?

458
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:21,995
Oh... I don't know.

459
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,005
<i>All I sa was a vague outline.</i>

460
00:40:25,073 --> 00:40:27,633
Can't you remember
anything about her?

461
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,973
Well, I remember
dancing with her.

462
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:33,071
If I ever dance with her again,
I'd probably recognize her.

463
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:36,345
Great. That takes care of
everything but finding her.

464
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:39,581
You were here. Why ask me how she
looked? I only saw her from the back.

465
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:43,420
She was a... About this...
She had a...

466
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,517
If I ever saw her from the
back again, I'd recognize her.

467
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:48,926
Well, that's fine.
After I've danced with her,

468
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:51,659
I just turn her around
for your okay.

469
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,928
This should be a cinch.

470
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:55,936
You saw her.

471
00:40:56,004 --> 00:41:00,703
<i>Describe her. Who, me? Well,
I wasn't watching very closely.</i>

472
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:05,439
She was a medium... medium-built
sort of a girl with a medium face.

473
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:08,482
She had a... a nice evening
gown on with a belt in the back.

474
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,780
She was built just like
a girlfriend of mine,

475
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:13,787
a girl you don't know, but...
her name was Consuela Schlepkiss.

476
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:16,722
She used to play the pinball
machine at the drugstore.

477
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:19,760
<i>She was high ma
three weeks in a row.</i>

478
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:22,490
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

479
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,362
That's nothing at all.
Happy to do it for you.

480
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:30,166
Say, I've got a hunch, fellas, we're
gonna find this girl eventually.

481
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,968
And when we do,
we'll be glad we waited for her.

482
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:36,977
Listen, I'm not interested in
getting any other partner, understand?

483
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:39,343
A chance meeting in the night.

484
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,713
Destiny.
She'll be back.

485
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:46,652
<i>Here's where we'll find he
on the next holiday. Here?</i>

486
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,814
Here.

487
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,688
I've got to go turn the roast.

488
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,374
Now don't worry.
We'll find her.

489
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:48,381
If I see her from the back
again, I'll recognize her.

490
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:51,714
It's kind of a roundabout way
to go at it, but let's try it.

491
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,164
<i Are you decent?

492
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:14,402
Yes, come in.

493
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:17,308
What's that?
Well, I thought it over,

494
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:19,812
and I believe our number
would go better in blackface.

495
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:22,441
Oh, I thought we were
gonna do it like this.

496
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,918
Well, that was before I...
before I thought it over.

497
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:28,114
I'll look terrible in the stuff. No.

498
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,022
I don't even know how to put
it on. I'll put it on for you.

499
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:35,290
I broke in as a bootblack,
you know. Here we go.

500
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:39,129
Oh!
For a month and a half...

501
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,431
I've been dreaming how pretty
I was going to look tonight.

502
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:45,768
Well, here's my punishment
for thinking so well of myself.

503
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,240
Oh, you'll have plenty
of times to be pretty.

504
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:51,540
I was just going to ask you to be
in the rest of the shows out here.

505
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:54,207
You were?
Will you?

506
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:57,308
Will I?
Fifteen nights a year...

507
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:02,322
Cinderella steps into her pumpkin
coach and becomes queen of Holiday Inn.

508
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,559
What's the matter?

509
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:10,257
I wish I didn't have to work all the other
days in the year to make these few possible.

510
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:13,129
Maybe a little later on
when we start doing better,

511
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:16,034
you can stay out here
all the time.

512
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:18,937
Did you hear
what you just said?

513
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:22,534
Yeah.
Was it a proposal?

514
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,977
Well, it will be when I get
a few bucks in the bank.

515
00:44:26,047 --> 00:44:29,175
Well, you're a strange duck.

516
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,583
You don't even give me a chance to say
"darling" and throw my arms around you.

517
00:44:32,654 --> 00:44:35,555
You'd better save that
till you see the bank book.

518
00:44:35,623 --> 00:44:40,390
Well, I guess
I'm sort of engaged.

519
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:05,046
Say, what is this,
a daisy chain?

520
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,179
Uh... well...

521
00:45:08,256 --> 00:45:11,987
we were just looking for the
back of a girl we don't know.

Good night.

567
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:38,794
I give up.
She's not here tonight.

568
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:41,800
You wait here. I'll go up
and see ifJim's seen her.

569
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:44,302
Gus is waiting to take you
to the station.

570
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:47,534
Remember, day after tomorrow,
St. Valentine's Day.

571
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:51,803
Someone's coming. Use the
other stairway. Well, who is it?

572
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:53,812
Bill collector.
Oh.

573
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,827
Good night.
Good night, Jim.

574
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:11,921
You'd better get inside before you
catch cold. You haven't got a coat.

575
00:49:11,998 --> 00:49:14,466
Well, I...
Go on.

576
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,936
I don't need a coat now.

577
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:24,809
<i>Hey, Ted did you find the girl?</i>

578
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,847
This is terrible. I wish we could
recognize her from the front.

579
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:30,007
I feel like a wolf.
Ted!

580
00:49:40,026 --> 00:49:42,256
Ted!

581
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,593
Ted!

582
00:49:45,665 --> 00:49:49,658
She's here! I saw her!
This way! Let go! Who?

583
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,670
Shortcut, come on!

584
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,229
Giddap!

585
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:01,910
Why, it's locked. It's never
been locked before. Oh, me!

586
00:50:01,982 --> 00:50:04,177
Let's try the other stairway.

587
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,185
Let go of me!
Go ahead.

588
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:16,591
Well, we've lost her again. Did you
get a look at her face this time?

589
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:19,393
No. We're still
working from the rear.

590
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,730
How do you know it was
her? She had an overcoat on.

591
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:25,532
I don't care if she ha... How do
you know she had an overcoat on?

592
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:29,871
Well, she... If she didn't,
look for a girl with pneumonia.

593
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,537
Come on, let's get inside.

594
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,081
Say, um, Jim,
when's your next show?

595
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:39,277
Next show? Uh, St.
Valentine's Day, I think.

596
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:41,820
Ooh, the day after tomorrow, huh? Is it?

597
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:44,686
That's a break. We'll get here
early and stay until we find her.

598
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:47,352
We'll make an announcement
asking her to identify herself.

599
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:51,363
We won't miss next time. No. Say,
fellas, how'd you like the show?

600
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:55,458
Well, we were so busy we
didn't see much of it, Jim. Why?

601
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:59,130
Thought the people seemed to like
the blackface routine. Yeah, they did.

602
00:50:59,205 --> 00:51:02,641
Don't you think a blackface number
on St. Valentine's Day'd be novel?

603
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:06,145
A what? It's no good,
huh? Just an idea I had.

604
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:09,648
Well, good-bye.
Good-bye. So long, Jim.

605
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:24,488
<i>Hey, lady!
Yes?</i>

606
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:27,499
We open in an hour. You
haven't even had a rehearsal.

607
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:30,001
<i>Coming.</i>

608
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,163
Oh, very smart.

609
00:51:32,238 --> 00:51:35,002
You'll have to talk Gus into
buying a horseless carriage.

610
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:38,101
I spend half my life between
here and the station.

611
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,409
Gus'll have to face the machine
age sooner or later, won't he?

612
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:46,284
Did you escape those bill collectors
the other night? Bill colle...

613
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:49,378
Oh, yes, temporarily. That reminds me,
I got a surprise for you downstairs.

614
00:51:49,456 --> 00:51:51,981
Well, thanks. What reminds you? Nothing.

615
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:54,822
It's just, uh, I want you
to remember the surprise...

616
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:57,362
when those doggone
bill collectors move in.

617
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:00,831
You sound sweet, but
you don't make sense.

618
00:52:06,072 --> 00:52:08,302
Oh, the inn is
so romantic-looking!

619
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:12,105
I posed for
those Cupids myself.

620
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:15,636
Hello, boys.
Hello, Linda. Hi, Jim.

621
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,979
A lot of paid-up
cards here tonight.

622
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:21,077
Where's the surprise?
Aha, right here.

623
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:24,851
A little home cookin'
I whipped up.

624
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,691
Beautiful.

625
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,398
"Be careful it's my heart."

626
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:39,131
And I ain't kiddin' either. I

Sorry, Jim,
I couldn't resist it.

659
00:56:15,187 --> 00:56:17,451
Wonderful! She's perfect.
Light as a feather.

660
00:56:17,522 --> 00:56:20,116
You found her. Jim, you're a pal. Yeah!

661
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:22,956
Do you realize we've been
searching for you for weeks?

662
00:56:23,028 --> 00:56:25,997
For me?
Yes! Ever since...

663
00:56:26,064 --> 00:56:29,158
The girl in the flower
shop. Yes, Mr. Reed.

664
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:33,534
Where have you been working
since New Year's Eve? Here.

665
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:37,041
<i>- Would you min letting me in on your secret?
- It's no secret.</i>

666
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:40,476
Ted Hanover is looking for a dancing
partner. We've decided to give you the job.

667
00:56:40,545 --> 00:56:42,979
Now wait just a minute!
No hard feelings, Jim.

668
00:56:43,048 --> 00:56:46,677
I don't blame you for trying. She's wonderful.
I feel as if I'd known her for months.

669
00:56:46,752 --> 00:56:49,016
Oh, same old feeling, huh?

670
00:56:49,087 --> 00:56:52,818
Washington's Birthday is the
next show. That'll give us a week.

671
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:55,758
<i>- We can open the act here.
- I'll take car of the invitations.</i>

672
00:56:55,827 --> 00:56:59,160
<i>Strictly formal. I'll get all the newspaper
boys from New York. Hold everything.</i>

673
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:02,166
This is my inn and I'm not running
it for a bunch of stuffed shirts.

674
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:04,429
What would you like,
the dungaree set?

675
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:08,371
That'd be better than that bunch of chowderheads
you'd drag in. Maybe I can't use the act.

676
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,433
- Not use Ted Hanover?
- Well, the show is pretty well set.

677
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:16,971
You're in, but he's out. You could change
the show for a special occasion like this.

678
00:57:17,049 --> 00:57:20,041
Of course he could. He's just
trying to hide his gratitude.

679
00:57:20,118 --> 00:57:22,484
Jim, you'd better
think up a number for us.

680
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:25,216
Well, just what do you
visualize, Ziggy?

681
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,485
Uh, let's see, um...

682
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:31,256
for Washington's Birthday, I see
a sort of a romantic costume thing.

683
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:34,457
Naturally. Something that just
reeks with grace and charm, you know.

684
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:38,025
Mm-hmm. I think the music
should be sweet and gentle to...

685
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:43,040
Well, to create the mood each time
I take her into my arms and kiss her.

686
00:57:43,108 --> 00:57:47,807
That's it. Don't you think it's

Come in!

704
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:17,643
In spite of what good old Jim tried to do
to us, your future starts as of tonight.

705
01:02:17,715 --> 01:02:20,980
Now, where would you like
to go from here? From here?

706
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:24,487
Yes. New York? Havana? Rio? We
have our pick of engagements.

707
01:02:24,555 --> 01:02:28,116
But I can't be your partner if you
leave the inn. Of course you can.

708
01:02:28,192 --> 01:02:31,218
There's no reason for
you to remain buried here.

709
01:02:31,295 --> 01:02:33,593
There's a very good reason.

710
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:37,065
I've promised to be in Jim's holiday
shows for the rest of the year.

711
01:02:37,134 --> 01:02:40,069
He tricked you into that while
he was hiding you from me.

712
01:02:40,137 --> 01:02:43,129
No matter how he did it,
I promised.

713
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:45,300
Besides, we're...

714
01:02:45,376 --> 01:02:47,970
Well, we're going to
be married. Married?

715
01:02:48,045 --> 01:02:51,344
Now wait a minute! Let's be
fair. He didn't give me a chance.

716
01:02:51,415 --> 01:02:53,815
After all, I love you too.

717
01:02:53,884 --> 01:02:56,318
From the very first moment
we danced together,

718
01:02:56,387 --> 01:02:58,821
I knew you were to be
the one girl in my life.

719
01:02:58,889 --> 01:03:01,619
But you... you didn't
even know my name.

720
01:03:01,692 --> 01:03:05,651
Please! All right, forget
about me, then. Forget aboutJim.

721
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:09,256
Think of yourself. Here's your chance
to do the one thing you like best.

722
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:13,292
Not only for 15 days
a year, but always.

723
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:16,939
Sorry, but I promised.

724
01:03:27,718 --> 01:03:32,655
Well... I guess I should apologize
for hoking up your number, huh?

725
01:03:32,723 --> 01:03:35,988
Oh, forget it. I'm the one
that should apologize to you.

726
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:38,994
Here I've been trying to
take Linda away from you,

727
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:42,759
not knowing you two were
going to be married. Married?

728
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:45,063
Yeah. Aren't you?

729
01:03:45,135 --> 01:03:48,434
Yes. Sure. Uh...

730
01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:51,338
I mean, naturally
we're sort of engaged.

731
01:03:51,408 --> 01:03:53,933
Oh.

732
01:03:54,011 --> 01:03:58,311
Well, um, anyway, I've decided to
bow out of here. Linda's all yours.

733
01:03:58,382 --> 01:04:01,317
Well, you're a pretty game
guy to take it this way.

734
01:04:01,385 --> 01:04:04,786
It's happened so often I'm
getting used to it, that's all.

735
01:04:04,855 --> 01:04:07,415
Good-bye, kid.
Lot of luck, Ted.

736
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:10,426
Thanks.

737
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:17,764
How are we doing?

738
01:04:17,835 --> 01:04:20,770
Two minutes ago, I would've
sold my chances for a tired dime.

739
01:04:20,838 --> 01:04:23,773
But when a man is surprised to
hear that he's going to be married,

740
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:25,934
that's when I go to work
with a clear conscience.

741
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:27,977

770
01:06:54,124 --> 01:06:57,525
Hello.

771
01:06:57,594 --> 01:07:00,722
I didn't exactly expect
the welcome mat,

772
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:04,460
but I thought somebody
might say hello. Hello.

773
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:07,594
What brings you here on this
bright and uninviting day?

774
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:11,937
- I've discovered something, my friends, about life.
- Meaning what?

775
01:07:12,009 --> 01:07:14,944
Well, I don't want success.

776
01:07:15,012 --> 01:07:18,072
I want the true happiness you
people have found here at the inn.

777
01:07:18,148 --> 01:07:20,241
You're not gonna stay
in the inn?

778
01:07:20,317 --> 01:07:24,048
Not just stay. I want to be part of
your shows, help you in your work,

779
01:07:24,121 --> 01:07:26,248
share your simple pleasures.

780
01:07:26,323 --> 01:07:29,019
I asked you once
not to interfere, Ted.

781
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:32,186
Please believe me, I'm a
tired, lonely and unhappy man,

782
01:07:32,262 --> 01:07:36,221
but I could be happy here helping
the two people I like the best.

783
01:07:36,299 --> 01:07:40,258
Will you take me in? My motherly
intuition tells me to throw him out.

784
01:07:40,337 --> 01:07:44,797
Well, at least give him the benefit of
the doubt. I've given him plenty of doubt.

785
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:49,209
Are you kidding with that"
Sharing life's simple pleasures"?

786
01:07:49,279 --> 01:07:52,578
May I go inside with
you? Why, of course.

787
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:55,083
My trunks will arrive
this afternoon.

788
01:07:55,152 --> 01:07:57,245
What do I do, move
in the broom closet?

789
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,051
That's no way to talk to a man who's here
to help you. The world doesn't change.

790
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:05,993
A gentle smile often breeds a kick in
the pants, but for your sake I'll be big.

791
01:08:06,063 --> 01:08:08,998
Hmm.

792
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:30,677
I'll give you a tip, Gus: They'll
go up and back, but not sideways.

793
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:34,520
I keep forgettin' this blame
thing can't see where it's going.

794
01:08:34,591 --> 01:08:38,789
Yeah. Well, unload the rest of
this stuff in the back, huh? Yeah.

795
01:08:44,968 --> 01:08:46,902
Hey!

796
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,404
<i>What'd you do get up before
breakfast? Oh, every morning.</i>

797
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:52,636
When I found out how late you got
in, I told Mamie to let you sleep.

798
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:55,405
Life on a farm.
Can't beat it, huh?

799
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:58,004
Jim, you've made me
very happy. That's fine.

800
01:08:58,081 --> 01:09:01,710
How about you making me happy? You sound
like a landlord with eviction papers.

801
01:09:01,785 --> 01:09:06,051
This is good news. Lila's back in
New York. I got a letter from her.

802
01:09:06,123 --> 01:09:09,024
What happened to her
millionaire? Slight mistake there.

803
01:09:09,092 --> 01:09:12,994
<i>He didn't own millions, he
owed them. Poor girl.</i>

804
01:09:13,063 --> 01:09:16,157
Always straying to greener
pastures and finding spinach. Yeah.

805
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:19,202
She was wondering if you'd be interested
in taking her back as a partner.

806
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:22,466
I think it'd be a great
idea. Naturally, you would.

807
01:09:22,539 --> 01:09:27,499
But I like it here with you and
Linda. Yes, we love having you too.

808
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:30,944
Uh, when are you leaving?

809
01:09:41,124 --> 01:09:43,217
Oh. Oh.

810
01:09:43,293 --> 01:09:45,488
Why didn't you say
something? You look so silly.

811
01:09:45,562 --> 01:09:47,689
Where's Jim?
Inside.

812
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:51,757
Good. I fixed it. Here's the news
in one luscious word: Hollywood.

813
01:09:51,835 --> 01:09:54,463
I told you I'm not leaving
until Linda goes with me.

814
01:09:54,538 --> 01:09:57,132
But this is the setup you
needed to get her away from Jim.

815
01:09:57,207 --> 01:10:00,802
There are gonna be two Hollywood
men here tonight. One's a director.

816
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:05,507
<i>If they like your dancing, you and
Linda will be on a train tomorrow.</i>

817
01:10:05,582 --> 01:10:08,346
We'd better find out
if Linda's interested.

818
01:10:08,418 --> 01:10:11,409
We let her know when there's a contract
staring her in the face. Look...

819
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:14,854
I know you're in love but forget
it until we get her away from him.

820
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:17,518
<i>This is no time to be honest.
Well, what should I do?</i>

821
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:22,326
We have to convinceJim that he'd be a heel if
he stood in the way of a chance like this.

822
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:25,629
Well, that'll be easy.
Like peeling a turtle.

823
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,807
Mamie says these go up here.
Yes. Set 'em right down.

824
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,848
Say, Gus, how'd you
like to earn a slow $10?

825
01:10:43,919 --> 01:10:46,319
Don't care how slow, but sure.

826
01:10:46,388 --> 01:10:49,050
It's sure, all right.
Here's the wrinkle:

827
01:10:49,124 --> 01:10:53,652
I want you to go to the station, pick up a party
and start for Holiday Inn, but never get here.

828
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:56,061
- Could you handle that?
- Wouldn't be surprised.

829
01:10:56,131 --> 01:11:00,966
Hello? Long distance. That's what
I want you to do with Linda Mason.

830
01:11:01,036 --> 01:11:03,402
Miss Mason?
Our friend?

831
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,838
You're not supposed
to understand it, Gus.

832
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:09,810
With that kind of money, you oughta
be able to go by way of Medicine Hat.

833
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:12,814
Hello? Yeah.
Just a minute.

834
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:18,943
Long distance. I want to get
Parkway Hotel, New York City.

835
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:21,114
Miss Lila Dixon.

836
01:11:43,612 --> 01:11:46,206
Didn't Linda say she'd
be here for rehearsal?

837
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:49,911
Oh, relax. Our audiences
aren't professional critics.

838
01:12:06,068 --> 01:12:09,504
Gus, you made a wrong turn. Shortcut.

839
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:17,411
Gus! Shortcut... to the shortcut.

840
01:12:33,963 --> 01:12:36,090
How could you possibly
expect to drive through this?

841
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:40,295
I never had no trouble
with a horse.

842
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:45,101
You'd better carry me to shore,
and I'll walk back to the highway.

843
01:12:45,174 --> 01:12:48,473
I think you'd be better off
waitin' right here.

844
01:12:48,544 --> 01:12:52,173
Gus, will you please
do as I say?

845
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:55,114
Oh, all right.

846
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:03,688
The other way! Turn around! Huh?

847
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:06,387
Gus, turn around! Oh! Oh!

848
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:08,930
Oh!

849
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:12,329
Gus!
Oh! Oh!

850
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:15,529
Oh, my hat!

851
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:18,232
Ya pushed me!
Get my hat!

852
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:28,382
I swear the show will start any
minute now. You said that an hour ago.

853
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:32,477
Yeah, but this time
I'm sincere. Excuse me.

854
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:58,545
Who started the show? I did. You're on.

855
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:01,447
What about Ted's partner? You've
kept this crowd waiting long enough.

856
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:04,397
He can go on without her. Have you
gone nuts? I rehearsed a double dance!

Will you give me a lift?
Sure. Hop in.

906
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:23,311
Aren't you Ted Hanover's
former dancing partner?

907
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:27,219
Yes, although I wouldn't
exactly say "former."

908
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:30,156
I'm dancing with him
at the inn tonight.

909
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:33,626
But I... Doesn't he
have a new partner?

910
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:36,823
Oh, she won't be there tonight.

911
01:17:36,898 --> 01:17:40,356
I didn't know that.
I-I work at the inn.

912
01:17:40,435 --> 01:17:43,563
Oh? Waitress?

913
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:49,071
Yes. I know your boss,
Jim Hardy, quite well.

914
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:51,806
<i>Quite well.</i>

915
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,941
<i>He's responsible for your
rejoining Mr. Hanover? Uh-huh.</i>

916
01:17:56,018 --> 01:17:58,953
By the way, if I were you,
I'd look my prettiest tonight.

917
01:17:59,021 --> 01:18:03,253
Jim says there'll be men there from Hollywood
to consider Ted and me for pictures.

918
01:18:03,325 --> 01:18:08,262
Mr. Hanover's other partner will be
missing this chance to go to Hollywood.

919
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:12,266
Yes, although she can't be very talented
or they wouldn't be working at the inn.

920
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:15,894
Ted and I played
only the best places.

921
01:18:17,338 --> 01:18:19,966
Listen, you're late
for the show already.

922
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:24,808
If you'd care to let me drive, I know a shortcut
that'll get us there 15 minutes sooner.

923
01:18:30,318 --> 01:18:33,412
There's a farmhouse near here, and I'll
have us towed out in a couple of minutes.

924
01:18:33,487 --> 01:18:36,422
For the love of mud,
hurry! Wait right here!

925
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:39,425
<i>What else can I do?</i>

926
01:18:43,698 --> 01:18:46,462
You're on now.

927
01:18:46,534 --> 01:18:49,025
But Linda isn't here yet.
You've got to save the pieces.

928
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:51,663
Keep those men interested now
and do a number with Linda later.

929
01:18:51,739 --> 01:18:54,333
What can I do?
Well, fake something.

930
01:18:54,408 --> 01:18:56,308
Fake something.

931
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:06,014
There's your cue! Don't
fail me! Keep 'em flying!

932
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:08,851
I'll keep 'em flying.

933
01:22:17,077 --> 01:22:21,844
Linda! What happened to
you? Bad job of sabotage.

934
01:22:23,617 --> 01:22:26,017
Excuse me.

935
01:22:28,589 --> 01:22:33,083
Well, Jim, you deliberately kept me from
working at the inn tonight, didn't you? Yeah.

936
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,687
You knew there would be men here from Hollywood
who might offer me a chance in pictures.

937
01:22:36,764 --> 01:22:41,701
You decided I shouldn't have that opportunity,
not even the opportunity to refuse.

938
01:22:41,769 --> 01:22:45,364
I was afraid the offer might be
too important for you to turn down.

939
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,237
The point is you don't trust
me to make my own decisions...

940
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:51,039
because they might interfere
with your own selfish plans.

941
01:22:51,111 --> 01:22:54,274
I've had about enough
of that, Jim.

942
01:22:54,348 --> 01:22:56,213
Ted! Linda!

943
01:22:56,283 --> 01:22:59,946
Mr. Parker, Mr. Dunbar, I want you to meet
the greatest dance team in show business:

944
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:02,580
Hanover and Mason
and the owner, Jim Hardy.

945
01:23:02,656 --> 01:23:05,124
Nice little place
you've got here.

946
01:23:05,192 --> 01:23:07,922
Even though you haven't seen Miss
Mason dance, I can assure you...

947
01:23:07,995 --> 01:23:11,931
Hardy, Hollywood is always interested in
new ideas and we think this is a honey.

948
01:23:11,999 --> 01:23:14,365
We'd like to do a picture
based on Holiday Inn.

949
01:23:14,435 --> 01:23:17,461
<i>The idea behind it, how it
works, the special holiday songs.</i>

950
01:23:17,538 --> 01:23:21,634
It's purely a speculative thing, far from
foolproof and we can't afford to pay too much.

951
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:25,577
You don't have to start talking it
down because the idea is not for sale.

952
01:23:25,646 --> 01:23:29,912
We expect to use Mr. Hanover
and his partner in the picture.

953
01:23:29,984 --> 01:23:34,887
I don't know how the others feel, but I'd
like to keep this setup just the way it is.

954
01:23:34,955 --> 01:23:38,049
Jim, would you be decent just once and
let somebody else here have a chance?

955
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:41,492
Wait a minute, Danny. The place
belongs to him. He can do as he wants.

956
01:23:41,562 --> 01:23:44,395
I guess it was just
too good to last, huh?

957
01:23:44,465 --> 01:23:47,434
A simple little layout where we could
do our best at the work we know...

958
01:23:47,501 --> 01:23:50,470
without having
any illusions of glory.

959
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:54,234
But I can see now that I'm the
only one who could be happy here.

960
01:23:54,308 --> 01:23:57,675
Go ahead, take the idea. Take the music,
take Linda, take the whole darned thing.

961
01:23:57,745 --> 01:24:00,942
<i>But what about you? We'll need you in
Hollywood to write the rest of the music.</i>

962
01:24:01,015 --> 01:24:05,076
Oh, no. I work right here. I'll
send you the music when it's written.

963
01:24:05,152 --> 01:24:08,485
And don't bother me
before, huh?

964
01:24:08,555 --> 01:24:11,991
<i>I guess maybe I was
a little selfish, huh?</i>

965
01:24:12,059 --> 01:24:16,519
Is that the deal you wanted, or
should I have thrown in my shirt?

966
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:19,862
Chummy sort of a fella,
isn't he?

967
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:23,369
Listen, Linda, if you
really want to stay here...

968
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:26,929
Don't talk that way! This is
the chance you wanted, isn't it?

969
01:24:27,007 --> 01:24:30,602
Of course!
Boy, are we happy!

970
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:10,433
Happy Thanksgiving,
Mr. Jim.

971
01:27:10,503 --> 01:27:13,404
Same to you, Mamie...
and staff.

972
01:27:13,472 --> 01:27:15,940
Didn't I tell you children
to stay in the kitchen?

973
01:27:16,008 --> 01:27:19,774
Those wings ain't gonna
fly away. Now shoo! Git!

974
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:24,616
Everything's ready and hot,

Who is this?
That's Mr. Jones.

996
01:29:02,381 --> 01:29:05,282
Jonesy? I'm sorry.
I knew him too well.

997
01:29:05,351 --> 01:29:10,983
But you've got to eat. The trouble
ain't with that turkey. It's you!

998
01:29:11,057 --> 01:29:14,083
I feel all right.
I'm riding high, Mamie.

999
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:18,028
Why'd you close the inn and sit around
like a jellyfish with the misery?

1000
01:29:18,097 --> 01:29:23,467
'Cause a slicker stole your gal and you
ain't got fight enough to get her back!

1001
01:29:23,536 --> 01:29:26,369
Um, excuse me,
Mr. Jim, but...

1002
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:31,376
I tried to keep her here. What kind
of keeping is that? Nothing but tricks!

1003
01:29:31,444 --> 01:29:36,507
If you went to Hollywood and told
Miss Linda how much you loves her,

1004
01:29:36,582 --> 01:29:40,575
and told her that the way
a lady likes to hear it told,

1005
01:29:40,653 --> 01:29:45,920
I'll betcha she'd be the quickest
ex-movie star that ever ex'd.

1006
01:29:45,992 --> 01:29:50,361
<i>You're crazy, Mamie.
I'm crazy?</i>

1007
01:29:50,429 --> 01:29:55,799
I knows Miss Linda. I knows
her like I knows my own kids.

1008
01:29:55,868 --> 01:29:59,304
Why, she ain't the fancy type
no more than you are.

1009
01:29:59,372 --> 01:30:02,864
What she wants is
what you got right here.

1010
01:30:02,942 --> 01:30:07,038
But women has to have them
things told to 'em the right way.

1011
01:30:07,113 --> 01:30:10,776
You could melt her heart
right down to butter...

1012
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,819
if you'd only turn on the heat.

1013
01:30:13,886 --> 01:30:17,481
Mamie, you don't, you don't try to
take a fella's gal away from him...

1014
01:30:17,556 --> 01:30:21,014
after he's bought the ring.

1015
01:30:21,093 --> 01:30:24,927
Or, as I recall, do
you? Now you're talkin'

1016
01:30:24,997 --> 01:30:29,400
Sure! Women has to be told
things the right way. Yes, sir!

1017
01:30:42,381 --> 01:30:46,112
At last! The night I've been
dreaming about, actually here.

1018
01:30:46,185 --> 01:30:49,279
This is my wedding. You
make me feel like a kibitzer.

1019
01:30:49,355 --> 01:30:52,290
Don't misunderstand me. I'm happy
because this marriage means...

1020
01:30:52,358 --> 01:30:55,054
that we can all settle down
and stop worrying.

1021
01:30:55,127 --> 01:30:57,561
I wish I had your confidence
without your viewpoint.

1022
01:30:57,630 --> 01:31:01,066
My fingers are crossed until Linda
and I are on that plane bound for Yuma.

1023
01:31:01,133 --> 01:31:04,864
What's worrying you? I've been
this close to marriage before,

1024
01:31:04,937 --> 01:31:08,395
only to wake and find myself
with no bride and a hangover.

1025
01:31:08,474 --> 01:31:12,410
<i>Look, the girl has said yes, the
picture finishes tonight.</i>

1026
01:31:12,478 --> 01:31:15,413
Come in. Everything
is all set and ready.

1027
01:31:15,481 --> 01:31:18,507
What could possibly happen...

1028
01:31:18,584 --> 01:31:21,951
Hi, fellas.

1029
01:31:23,122 --> 01:31:25,886
<i>Jim! Wh-What
brought you here?</i>

1030
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:29,416
Train. Chug-chug-chug-chug.
Wedding? When is it?

1031
01:31:29,495 --> 01:31:31,429
Wedding?
Yeah.

1032
01:31:31,497 --> 01:31:34,557
Uh, well, we hadn't set
an exact time.

1033
01:31:34,633 --> 01:31:37,124
Have you seen Linda?
No. No, not yet.

1034
01:31:37,203 --> 01:31:40,661
Say, I saw your director. He told me
he was shooting the finale tonight.

1035
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:43,833
Thought I'd like to see how you
make pictures. Uh, he wouldn't...

1036
01:31:43,909 --> 01:31:46,844
Y - You wouldn't like what
they're doing tonight. Why not?

1037
01:31:46,912 --> 01:31:50,746
That's dull, technical stuff. Well,
I'm a dull, technical sort of a fella.

1038
01:31:50,816 --> 01:31:54,684
Perhaps if you'd wait and
see Linda tomorrow. Oh, no!

1039
01:31:54,753 --> 01:31:59,816
I want to see the finish. The success
of you and Linda means a lot to me, pal.

1040
01:31:59,892 --> 01:32:03,555
Say, why don't you be
yourself? What are you up to?

1041
01:32:03,629 --> 01:32:05,893
Well, I'm a son of a gun.

1042
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:08,900
This is a beautiful hunk of welcome
for a guy who comes coast to coast...

1043
01:32:08,968 --> 01:32:12,927
just to wish you a merry
Christmas and a happy wedding.

1044
01:32:13,005 --> 01:32:16,532
Remember how I suspected you when
you came to the inn on Easter morning?

1045
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:19,908
That was silly, wasn't it? Now
I know he's up to something.

1046
01:32:19,979 --> 01:32:22,573
Wait a minute. Let's not be unfair. Huh?

1047
01:32:22,648 --> 01:32:25,913
We're treating Jim like a poor country
cousin. He doesn't mean any harm.

1048
01:32:25,985 --> 01:32:28,385
No. No. He just wants to see Linda.

1049
01:32:28,454 --> 01:32:32,151
Let's show him Linda! Good
will on earth toward men!

1050
01:32:32,224 --> 01:32:36,593
Where are we going?
What's this? Hey!

1051
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:38,960
Hey, Ted, what is this?

1052
01:32:39,031 --> 01:32:41,966
I was afraid you'd gone
crazy. I'll keep him here...

1053
01:32:42,034 --> 01:32:44,594
<i>till you get Lind
on that plane.</i>

1054
01:32:46,505 --> 01:32:48,598
<i
I'd better get my clothes on.

1055
01:32:48,674 --> 01:32:52,337
<i>I'll go on the set and see how near ready
they are. My clothes are in there!</i>

1056
01:32:52,411 --> 01:32:54,971
- Merry Christmas!
- Jim! Pal!

1057
01:32:55,047 --> 01:32:58,483
Wait! Stop! We were only fooling!

1058
01:32:58,551 --> 01:33:01,714
Only you could think
of a thing like that.

1059
01:33:08,727 --> 01:33:11,662
Who're you calling?
Nobody.

1060
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:14,324
The operator's gone.

1061
01:33:44,897 --> 01:33:49,095
Take it easy.
Don't break your neck.

1062
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:57,375
It's one of the most authentic
reproduction jobs we've ever done. Is it?

1063
01:33:57,443 --> 01:34:01,971
And all worked out from those photographs
we took of your place in Connecticut.

1064
01:34:02,047 --> 01:34:07,246
Oh! Well, Mamie and the kids oughta
see this. They'd never believe it.

1065
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:11,449
Anything wrong? Well, that Christmas
tree is a little out of place.

1066
01:34:11,523 --> 01:34:15,289
I guess nobody'd notice that
but me or... Linda.

1067
01:34:15,361 --> 01:34:18,524
We're going to start rolling. Come along
with me where you can see everything.

1068
01:34:18,597 --> 01:34:21,622
No. I'll just stay in the background.
I don't want to get in your way.

1069
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:25,635
Well, suit yourself.
I'll see you later. Right.

1070
01:34:44,188 --> 01:34:47,715
All right, we're going to follow you
on the boom from here inside the inn.

1071
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:50,727
When you get in the
other set, do your song.

1072
01:34:50,795 --> 01:34:54,231
I think you have the mood. Your
Hollywood success was empty,

1073
01:34:54,299 --> 01:34:58,360
you've lost the one man you
love; you know, the usual hoke.

1074
01:34:58,436 --> 01:35:01,371
Just make me cry and you
can get to that wedding.

1075
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:04,499
All ready for rehearsal!
No, please. Let's shoot it.

1076
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:08,011
Okay.
It's a take!

1077
01:35:10,081 --> 01:35:13,414
All right, everybody, quiet
on the stage. It's a take.

1078
01:35:13,484 --> 01:35:16,146
Close 'em up!

1079
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:20,247
<i>Come on over there. Quiet down.
Let's get settled, everybody.</i>

1080
01:35:22,427 --> 01:35:25,828
<i>Come on, everybody, let's get
settled now. It's the picture.</i>

1081
01:35:25,897 --> 01:35:29,628
Get out of here with your
brooms. Hit your snow!

1082
01:35:30,702 --> 01:35:33,068
<i>All right, roll 'em!</i>

1083
01:35:39,077 --> 01:35:43,377
Sorry, but when the red light's on, you
couldn't get in even if you owned the studio.

1084
01:35:43,448 --> 01:35:46,144
But, pop, this is important.
I know. So is the light.

1085
01:35:46,217 --> 01:35:49,277
Hit your playback!
Music!

1086
01:35:52,523 --> 01:35:55,321
