Hello, Lila.
Jimmy boy.

354
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,576
How are you?
I'm so glad to see you.

355
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,661
It's good to see you.

356
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,204
I thought you were alone, Jim.

357
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,664
Who's your friend,
and what's her hurry?

358

Don't ask me, she's your friend.

00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,167
Mine?
Yeah.

360
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,128
What is she afraid of?
Facing me?

00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,254

00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,338
"Darling, I swear."

Yeah.
Will be if it ever opens up.

368
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,372
Well, why shouldn't it open?

369
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,540
Well, I ain't one to talk,

370
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,250
but you could probably
buy a half interest

371

in this place for
a barrel of apples.

372

7:43, if I can flag her down.

Where's the boss?

Was it as large as this
when it was a farmhouse?

391
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,892
Yeah, it was built by a fellow
who felt cramped in New York.

lumber, though.

Get back in the kitchen.

Oh, we had a little accident.

Please to know you, Miss Linda.

and that's Vanderbilt.

Mason up to the guest room

and change her into
anything that'll fit her

dry, huh?

Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.

something you dream about at night

414
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,832
and it would be wonderful,

415
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,168
then you'd wake up in the morning
and realize it couldn't work.

416
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:06,171
Oh, it'll work, if I can sell
the idea to some performers.

417
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,214
They seem to think
that profit sharing

418
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,216
means taking bows
on an empty stomach.

419
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,343
So that's why you're
not open tonight.

420
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,512
Well, I'm also,
sort of, particular

421
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,639
about the kind of
talent I'm gonna use.

422
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,392
Fifteen holidays a year.

No, not especially.

426
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,149
Just have my own
ideas about living.

427
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,153
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.

428
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,489
Never amounted to much,
didn't care.

429
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:34,908
But as long as he was alive

430
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,702
we always had plenty to eat
and clothes to keep us warm.

431
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,454
Were you happy?
Yes.

432
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,667
Then your father was a very successful man.
Hope I can do as well.

433
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,420
Say, I came out here for a job.
Could you use me?

434
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,339
Well, I might find
a spot for you

435
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,715
in my first show.
What can you do?

436
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,926
I sing a little and dance.

437
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,511
Couldn't guarantee
any salary at first,

438
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,639
right now I've got
the ledger and an iron lung.

439
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,266
I don't care if you pay off in
eggs, just give me a chance.

440
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,726
Well, let's see what you can do.

441
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,186
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

442
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,104
You know, I've written special
music for each holiday.

443
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,608
This sort of gives me a chance to keep
a little promise I made to myself.

444
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,693
I said I was gonna sing this
song at the inn tonight.

510
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,142
Francois, have you
seen Mr. Hanover?

511
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,269
Twice, sir.

512
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,353
What happened?

513
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,646
The first time, sir,

514
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,982
he came from his dressing room
with a telegram in his hand.

515
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,985
He ordered Scotch and
soda, a bottle of each.

516
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,528
I know, I know.
What then?

517
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,113
The second time he came
from his dressing room

518
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,490
he asked which way
is Connecticut.

519
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,200
Connecticut?
Connecticut.

520
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,287
He said he has a friend there
who knows about women, too.

521
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,163
Why didn't you stop him?

522
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,082
How could I stop him,
sir, when I don't know

523
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,376
which way is Connecticut.

524
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:00,668
Which way is Connecticut.

525
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,297
Who said Holiday Inn
wouldn't work?

526
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,258
Well, we're gonna divvy up a stack
of important money tonight, huh?

527
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,509
Man, man.

528
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,678
I've got a landlady who's gonna
ask for your autographed picture.

529
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,762
No.

You were clinging to the

remember anything? Uh...

614

Let's see.
I had a wire from Lila

telling me she's going to marry
some millionaire or something.

616

Mmm-hmm.

Can't you remember
anything about her?

00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,340

00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,309

again, I'd recognize her.

Well, that's fine.

663
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,818
After I've danced with her,

664
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,903
I'll just turn her around
for your okay.

00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,613

You saw her, describe her.

667
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,538
Who, me? Well, I wasn't
watching very closely.

668
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,291
She was a medium...
Medium-built sort of a girl,

669
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,002
with a medium face.
She had a nice evening gown on

670
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,587
with a belt in the back.

671
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,881
See, she was built just
like a girl friend of mine.

672
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,717
A girl you don't know but her
name was Consuela Stupkis.

673
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,345
She used to play the pinball machine
a lot down at the corner drugstore.

674
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,348
I remember one time she was high man.
Three weeks in a row.

675
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,184
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

676
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,937
That's nothing at all,
happy to do it.

677
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,189
See, I got a hunch, fellas.

678
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,692
I've got a hunch we're going
to find this girl eventually.

679

any other partner, understand?

for you downstairs.

856
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,062
Well, thanks.
What reminds you?

857
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:51,274
Nothing, it's just...
I mean, I want you to remember the surprise

858
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,985
when those doggone
bill-collectors move in.

859
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,654
You sound sweet,
but you don't make sense.

860
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,913
The inn is so romantic looking.

861
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,582
Nice? I posed for
those cupids myself.

862
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,084
Hello, boys.

863
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,295
ALL: Hi. How are you?

864
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,339
Paid-up cards here tonight.

865
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,049
Where's the surprise?

866
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:19,886
Aha! Right here,
a little home cooking I whipped up.

867
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:24,849
Beautiful.

868
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,773
LINDA: "Be Careful
It's My Heart."

869
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,858
And I ain't kidding, either.

870
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,068
I wrote this just for
you, honey.

00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,413
You found her, Jim.
You're a pal.

899
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,497
Yeah.

900
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,832
Young lady, do you realize

901
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,542
that we've been searching
for you for weeks?

902
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,461
For me?
Yes, ever since...

903
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,547
The girl in the flower shop.

904
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,257
Yes, Mr. Reed.

905
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,217
Where have you been working
since New Year's Eve?

906
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,510
Here.

907
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,346
Would you mind letting
me in on your secret?

908
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,598
Oh, it's no secret.

909
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,725
Ted Hanover is looking
for a new dancing partner

910
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,976
and we've decided
to give you the job.

911
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,269
Oh, here now.
Wait, just a minute.

912
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,729
Oh, no hard feelings, Jim,

913
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,773
I don't blame you for trying.
She is wonderful.

914
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,357
I feel as if I've
known her for months.

915
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,359
Oh. Same old feeling, huh?

916
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,987
Let's see, Washington's
Birthday is the next show.

917
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,740
That will give us a week of rehearsals.
We can open the act here.

918
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,117
DANNY: I'll take care of the invitations.
Strictly formal.

919
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,744
I'll get all the newspaper
boys from New York.

920
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,913
Now hold everything.
This is my inn,

921
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,040
and I am not running it for
a bunch of stuffed shirts.

922
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,792
What would you like,
the dungaree set?

923
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,461
Well, that would be better than the
bunch of chowder heads you drag in.

924
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,962
Maybe I can't use the act.

925
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,881
Not use Ted Hanover?

926
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,674
Well,
the show is pretty well set.

927
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,760
You're in, but he's out.

928
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,846
But you could change the show
for a special occasion like this.

929
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,682
Of course he could.
He's just trying to hide his gratitude.

930
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,935
Jim, you better think
up a number for us.

931
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,729
Well, just what do you
visualize, Ziggy?

932
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,981
Ah, let's see.

933
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:27,693
For Washington's birthday I see,
sort of, a romantic costume thing.

934
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,779
Naturally.
Something that just reeks

935
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,864
with grace and charm, you know?
Mmm-hmm.

936
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,201
I think the music should
be sweet and gentle to...

937
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,996
Well, to create the mood,
each time I take her into my arms and kiss her.

938
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,832
That's it.

939
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,168

977
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,313
your future starts
as of tonight.

We have our pick of engagements, you know.

981
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,531
But I can't be your partner
if you leave the inn.

982
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:27,576
Of course you can. There's no reason
for you to remain buried here.

983
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,662
There's a very good reason.

984
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,416
I promised to be in Jim's holiday
shows for the rest of the year.

985
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,667
Ah, but he tricked you into that

while he was hiding you from me.

987
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,838
No matter how he did
it, I've promised.

988
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,008
Besides, well,
we're going to be married.

989
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:46,429
Married?
Now wait a minute, let's be fair.

990
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,097
He didn't give me a chance.

991
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,890
After all, I love you, too.

992
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,518
Linda, from the very first
moment we danced together,

993
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,479
I knew you were to be
the one girl in my life.

994
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:57,606
You didn't even know my name.

995
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,235
Please.
All right, forget about me, then.

996
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,612
Forget about Jim,
think of yourself.

997
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,906
Here's your chance to do
the one thing you like best.

998
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,701
Not only for 15 days a
year, but always.

999
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,955
Sorry, but I promised.

1000
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,593
Well?

1001
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,221
I guess I should apologize for
hooking up your number, huh?

1002
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:33,058
Oh, forget it. I'm the one
that should apologize to you.

1003
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:35,644
Here I've been trying to
take Linda away from you

1004
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,438
not knowing you two were
going to be married.

1005
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,731
Married?

1006
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:42,067
Yeah, aren't you?

1007
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:44,737
Yes, sure.

1008
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,240
I mean, naturally,
we're sort of engaged.

1009
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:49,867
Oh.

1010
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,580
Well, anyway, I've decided to bow out of here.
Linda's all yours.

1011
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,791
Well, you're a pretty game
guy to take it this way.

1012
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:01,337
Well, it's happened so often I'm
getting used to it, that's all.

1013
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,546

1014
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:03,839

1015
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,174

1017
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,186

sold my chances for a tired dime.

1018
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,688
But when a man is surprised to
hear that he's going to be married,

1019
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,525
brother, that's when I go to
work with a clear conscience.

Well, at least give him
the benefit of the doubt.

I was afraid the offer might

be too important for
you to turn down.

1291

Hardy, Hollywood
is always interested

The idea behind it, how it
works, the special holiday songs.

1349
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,009

1350
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:29,053

1351
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,221
You're a little flat, too.

1352
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:35,476
How could anybody ask for more?

1353
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,479
My needs are small
I buy them all

1354
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:41,857
At the five and ten cent store

1355
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:43,025
Sing it!

1356
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,193
Sing it pretty.

1357
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:46,570
Oh, I've got plenty
to be thankful for

1358
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,411
Why, you ain't ate a bite.

1359
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,330
I'm pouting, Mamie.

1360
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:57,498
Who is this?

1361
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,916
That's Mr. Jones.

1362
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:02,044
Jonesey! I'm sorry,
I knew him too well.

1363
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:03,838
But you got to eat.

1364
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:07,591
The trouble ain't with that turkey, Mr.
Jim, it's you!

1365
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:10,469
I feel all right.
I'm riding high, Mamie.

1366
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,763
Well, why you close
the inn and sit around

1367
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,807
like a jellyfish
with the misery?

1368
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,976
'Cause a slicker stole your gal

1369
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,645
and you ain't got fight
enough to get her back.

1370
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,107
Excuse me, Mr. Jim.

1371
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,942
I tried to keep her here!

1372
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:26,902
What kind of keeping is that?

1373
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:30,031
Nothing but tricks.
If you went to Hollywood

1374
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:32,283
and told Miss Linda
how much you loves her,

1375
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,660
and misses her,
and told her that

1376
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:37,204
the way a lady
likes to hear it told,

1377
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:42,835
I'll bet you she'd be the quickest
ex-movie star that ever exed.

1378
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,587
You're crazy, Mamie

1379
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:49,050
I'm crazy?
I knows Miss Linda.

1380
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:52,511
I knows her like
I knows my own kids.

1381
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,973
Why, she ain't the fancy
type no more than you are.

1382
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:59,685
What she wants is
what you got right here.

1383
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:03,773
But women has to have them things
told to them the right way.

1384
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:07,068
You could melt her heart
right down to butter,

1385
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:10,362
if you'd only turn on the heat.

1386
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:13,324
Mamie, you don't try
to take a fellow's gal

1387
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,576
away from him after
he's bought the ring.

1388
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,538
Or as I recall, do you?

1389
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,749
Now you're talking!

1390
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,710
Oh, sure, women has to be
told things the right way.

1391
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,003
MAMIE: Yes, sir!

1392
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:42,895
At last, the night I've been
dreaming about actually here.

1393
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,438
This is still
my wedding, you know.

1394
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:45,856
You make me feel
like a kibitzer.

1395
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:48,859
Now don't misunderstand me,
I'm happy because this marriage means

1396
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,445
that we can all settle
down and stop worrying.

1397
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,031
I wish I had your confidence
without your viewpoint.

1398
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:55,950
My fingers are crossed
until Linda and I

1399
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,535
are on that plane
bound for Yuma.

1400
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,203
Now what's worrying you?

1401
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,413
I don't know, except I've been
this close to marriage before

1402
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:02,748
only to wake up next morning

1403
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,792
and find myself with
no bride and a hangover.

1404
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:07,253
Look, the girl said yes,
the picture finishes tonight,

1405
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,380
there's a judge waiting in Yuma.

Hi, fellows!

1410
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,518
Jim, what brought you here?

1411
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:24,270
Train.
Chug chug chug chug.

1412
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:26,772
The wedding, when is it?

1413
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,024
Wedding?
Yeah.

1414
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,318
Well, we hadn't
set any exact time.

1415
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,736
Have you seen Linda?

1416
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,197
No, no, not yet.
But, say, I saw your director,

1417
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:37,324
he told me he was shooting
the finale tonight,

1418
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:39,076
thought I'd like to see
how you make pictures.

1419
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:42,413
He wouldn't... You wouldn't
like what they're doing tonight.

1420
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,622
Why not?

1421
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,166
Oh, no, that's dull,
technical stuff.

1422
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,459
Well, I'm a dull,
technical sort of a fellow.

1423
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,045
Perhaps if you'd wait
and see Linda tomorrow.

1424
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:53,048
Oh, no, I want to
see the finish.

1425
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:56,552
The success of you and Linda
means a lot to me, pal.

1426
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,929
Say, why don't you be yourself.
What are you up to?

1427
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,809
Well, I'm a son of a gun.
This is a beautiful hunk of welcome

1428
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:05,311
for a guy who
comes coast to coast

1429
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:08,105
just to wish you a merry
Christmas and a happy wedding.

1430

(CHUCKLES)

1431
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,150
You remember how I suspected you

1432
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,319
when you came to live at
the inn on Easter morning?

1433
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:15,362
Silly, wasn't it?

1434
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:16,572
Now I know he's up to something.

1435
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,032
Oh, wait a minute now
let's not be unfair.

1436
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,074
No?

1437
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:21,660
No, we're treating Jim
like a poor country cousin.

1438
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:23,120
He doesn't mean any harm! No!

1439
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:24,955
No, he just wants to see Linda.

1440
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,374
So let's show him Linda.

1441

of a thing like that.

a little out of place.

notice that but me or Linda.
