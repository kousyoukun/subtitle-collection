00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:49,837
Merry Christmas, bud. Thank
you. Merry Christmas to you.

4
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,838
Okay.
Hi, chief.

5
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:43,490
Come in.

6
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:45,492
Hello, honey.

7
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:50,989
Well, this is our last night in
show business. Some feeling, huh?

8
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:54,831
Some feeling. I got the
ring and the license.

9
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:57,632
Honey, we're ready.
Oh.

10
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:01,197
Say, there's a hook leftover
at the top here. Should that be?

11
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:04,711
Never mind that, dear.
I'll take care of it.

12
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,940
Jim.
Huh?

13
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:12,783
Well, I think that
tie is terrible.

14
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:17,382
Well, who cares? Tomorrow I'm a
farmer. You'd better go change it.

15
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,394
Listen, honey, when you flip on those twinkle
toes, who's going to be looking at my tie?

16
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:26,024
You only have five minutes.
Hurry. Okay, I'm on my way.

17
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,915
What'd he say?
I didn't tell him.

18
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:45,851
Why not? We love each other.
You want to continue dancing.

19
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,388
I know, but...
he gets a look.

20
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:52,290
Oh, he's always had that look. It
doesn't mean anything emotionally.

21
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,091
It has to do with his liver.
Tell him you've made a mistake.

22
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:59,292
You don't want to give up
your career and live on a farm.

23
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:03,235
But he's already bought the farm
and the license and the ring.

24
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, I can't tell him.

25
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:09,099
All right. I will.
Right after our number.

26
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:12,544
Listen, darling, don't weaken.
Think of our life together.

27
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:16,674
Think of diamonds, of sables,
of your own little penthouse.

28
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:21,586
Is that a promise? Well, just
think about them for the time being.

29
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:24,716
<i Ready, Miss
Dixon. Oh, thank you.

30
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:28,193
This thing didn't come
out even. Oh, I'll fix it.

31
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:31,959
We have to hurry.
I love you.

32
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:35,594
I love you...
and Jim.

33
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,334
I loveJim too. But after all,
I mean, let's not be too chummy.

Not much of a Christmas
present for you, is it?

66
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,639
I mean, both of us
walking out on you.

67
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:11,742
Don't worry about me, kid.
I'll do all right. What a chump.

68
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,052
Can't you see what we're walking
out on? The grind, 365 days a year.

69
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:20,787
When was the last time you had a day
off? I don't know. Maybe last year.

70
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:24,888
Did you ever hear ofThanksgiving
or Labor Day or the Fourth ofJuly?

71
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:27,195
Vaguely. You know what
they are, don't you?

72
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:30,135
They're holidays, days of
rest. There's lots of'em.

73
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:32,934
They mark 'em in red on the
calendar so you can't miss 'em.

74
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:37,944
What happens in show business when a holiday comes along?
You give an extra performance.

75
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:42,039
Not for me, brother. Lila and I are
going up to that farm in Connecticut.

76
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,880
<i>We're gonna liv
by the calendar.</i>

77
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:49,321
<i>Say, Jim, uh... there's something
you should know. Hmm?</i>

78
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,154
Oh, I know, Ted. I feel
the same way about you.

79
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:55,855
You know, we've had
our ups and our downs.

80
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,490
We've fought a little over
women, but... I know, but...

81
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,761
Sorry, Jimmy boy,
but that's life.

82
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:04,566
If I'm not the best manager in the
business, I'll eat a mechanic's shirt.

83
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:07,903
Fifteen weeks at the Park Club,
sight unseen, for you and Lila.

84
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:12,571
Two hundred dollars a week more than you
were getting with the farmer thrown in.

85
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:17,345
What's the matter?
I haven't told him.

86
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:19,477
You haven't told him?
You haven't told him?

87
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,021
Haven't told me what?
What's the news?

88
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:25,616
Well, don't be upset, Jim dear.
It isn't that I don't love you.

89
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,662
I do.
I love everybody.

90
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:31,698
But when Ted explained
how much he loved me and...

91
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:35,201
All at once we both realized
that we belonged together.

92
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:37,328
The two of us,
dedicating our lives...

93
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:41,204
to making people happy with
our feet. The two of you, huh?

94
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:44,733
Dedicating your lives to making
people happy with your feet.

95
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:49,112
That's sweet. Well, I guess that
kick I just got was a good start, huh?

96
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,276
Sorry, Jimmy boy,
but that's life.

97
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:54,844
It's best you found out now. You
wouldn't want to make Lila unhappy.

98
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:58,085
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't
want to make Lila unhappy.

99
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,526
Not now, now that I
really know her.

100
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:05,929
What a narrow squeak that was.

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,801
What do you mean by that? Oh,
nothing, honey. I'm happy you're happy.

102
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:14,637
That little speech sounds like
the crackle of confederate money.

103
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,109
Well, kids, I'm still
going to rejoin the human race.

104
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,342
I hope you get a lot of work,
holidays included.

105
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,009
Dance yourselves into
beautiful nervous breakdowns.

Oh, brother! There's the
hardest work in the world.

125

Oh, but this can't miss. I'm
turning the farm into an inn!

130
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,161
But what an inn.
Here, read up, brother.

"Holiday Inn.
Midville, Connecticut.

132
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,532
"Get off the highway
and relax on a farm.

133
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:59,000
Dancing, entertainment, home
cooking. Open holidays only."

134
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:02,108
Open holidays only? How many
of those are there? Mm-hmm.

135
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:04,201
Oh, there's about 15.

136
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,214
That gives me 350 days a year to kick
around in. You would think of that.

137
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:11,149
Did you get your discharge
from that sanitarium?

138
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:16,019
Oh, don't you worry. This is going to
work. I'm having auditions every day.

139
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,617
If you run into any talent,
will you send 'em out?

140
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,923
Sure, as soon as I get back.

141
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:26,091
I'm flying down to Miami Beach tonight to
set an engagement for Ted and Lila. Lila.

142
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,963
You forgot the flowers.

143
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,526
Don't get excited. There's a
flower shop out at the airport.

144
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:33,095
I guarantee to have orchids
before her first number.

145
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:37,633
Boy, you'd better. This kid even
expects presents on Father's Day.

146
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:40,612
Well, good luck, Jim.
So long, Ted.

147
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:44,549
Have a nice trip. I mean,
yeah, thanks, I will.

148
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:48,120
That reminds me,
I forgot to give him...

149
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:50,884
a little Christmas
remembrance I brought along.

150
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,085
Got one here for each of you.

151
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,618
Say, this is swell.
What is it?

152
00:13:56,697 --> 00:14:00,895
Homemade peach preserves. I put 'em up
myself before I went into the sanitarium.

153
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:03,232
Boy, do I go for those!

154
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:06,761
Why, they're great on...
on, uh... or even plain.

155
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,308
They're nonfattening too.

156
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:12,072
Well, it's a long trip.
I think I'll get along.

157
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:15,115
Will you say hello to Lila for
me? You've got to catch the act.

158
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:20,119
We've got some new routines.
And then after the show...

159
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,660
I don't think they like
this nightclub air.

160
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,764
Wait. You'd better
wait for Lila's.

161
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,212
I think Danny's was the
loudest. It was a different tone.

162
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:55,046
Dawn patrol, huh?

163
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:02,188
Hello.
Am I too late?

164
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:05,527
You would've been
in another minute.

165
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,636
Danny Reed.

166
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,467
Listen, I have to wait
on that man. But, uh...

167
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:19,103
I'll work five nights free. Anything.
Just leave me alone and don't butt in.

168
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:25,109
What would you like? Orchids.
The finest you've got.

169
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:27,949
Corsage?
No, no, a dozen.

170
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:30,785
Loose, looking like
they don't care.

171
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:34,419
All right. There. "Lila... love, Ted."

172
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:38,989
<i>Have them delivered to Miss Lila Dixon
at the Club Pierre before 11:00.</i>

173
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:42,502
Oh, I'm sorry, but our delivery
truck is on its last trip...

174
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,094
and won't be back
until after 11:00.

175
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,299
How about a messenger boy?

176
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:51,310
It's impossible to guarantee
delivery this late on Christmas Eve.

177
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:55,212
But to help you out, I'll
take them. Oh, there you are.

178
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:58,740
A dozen orchids, please.
Lady, you're a lifesaver.

179
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:02,311
Here. Here's $5.00. Take your
boyfriend out and show him a good time.

180
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:04,516
Let's consider this
a personal favor.

181
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:07,321
Well, I can't leave town
indebted to a stranger.

182
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:10,158
Would you like to see the floor
show at the club? I'd like to, but...

183
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,664
Now you just give
this card to Francois,

184
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:17,602
and he'll seat you at the entertainer's
table. Why, you're Mr. Reed!

185
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:20,071
Uh-oh.
I'm Linda Mason.

186
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,132
This is a part-time job.
Actually, I sing and dance.

187
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,941
Mr. Reed, I want... I know, I know. You've
studied dancing since you were a child.

188
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,812
You spent long, weary hours
in every agency on Broadway.

189
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:32,716
But just now I happen to be
catching a plane to Mi...

190
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:37,587
Once you told me I was no good, I could get
a job in a bargain basement and like it.

191
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:40,388
Now look, honestly,
as soon as I get...

192
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,827
Oh, of course, sure.
You worked hard.

193
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,923
You want a chance. So what?
So I'm going to give it to you.

194
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,936
Ajob? Uh-huh. A friend of mine is opening
a place in Connecticut: Holiday Inn.

195
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:55,668
You take that card out there, tell
him I sent you and you'll be all set.

196
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:58,643
Mr. Reed, how could I
possibly thank you? Don't.

197
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:02,375
Just deliver those orchids
and let me catch my plane.

198
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,399
This table's reserved
for the band. Excuse me!

199
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:24,028
Fussy, isn't he?

200
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:28,541
I think I'll have
a bowl of coffee, huh?

201
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:33,279
And the lady?
Coffee.

202
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:54,856
- We seem to be on the 40-cent
tour here. - It is embarrassing.

203
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:58,371
I'm Jim Hardy.
Linda Mason.

204
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:03,137
Got a friend in the show? Well,
I'm here at Mr. Reed's invitation.

205
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,169
Oh, Danny.
Then you know Ted Hanover?

206
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:10,683
Why, yes, naturally.

207
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:14,209
Oh, my. He's quite a man
with the ladies, that Ted.

208
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:19,224
Well, after all, he's a very
attractive man. Do you know him?

209
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:24,457
Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, I've been
considering Ted and his partner for my new club.

210
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:27,728
- Oh, you have a place?
- Oh, yes, yes.

211
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:32,295
I don't know though. His act might not
go so well in a place as large as mine.

212
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:36,706
Well, I've found that the size
of a place doesn't matter...

213
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:39,439
if one has
sufficient personality.

214
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:43,711
That's what you've found, huh?
You in show business?

215
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,184
Oh... I'm Linda Mason.

216
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:49,188

242
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:04,410
Who?
Ted and Lila.

243
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:07,146
Hey, what's the matter?

244
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,678
Hello, Lila. How are you? Jimmy
boy! I'm so glad to see you.

245
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:14,249
I thought you were alone. Who's
your friend and what's her hurry?

246
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:17,524
- Don't ask me. She's your friend.
- Mine?

247
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:20,964
- What is she afraid of, facing me?
- Darling, I swear I never...

248
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:24,936
"Darling, I swear." You lie. If
you don't... You're on. Take a bow.

249
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:30,436
<i>Encore!</i>

250
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:51,828
So this is Holiday Inn.

251
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:54,389
Yeah, will be
if it ever opens up.

252
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:57,766
Why shouldn't it open? I ain't
one to talk, but you could buy...

253
00:22:57,837 --> 00:23:00,772
a half interest in this
place for a barrel of apples.

254
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,571
Next train for New York's at
7:43 if we can flag her down.

255
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:13,815
Say, I'm looking for a job.
Where's the boss?

256
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:17,618
Right here. I'll
be down in a second.

257
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:25,026
So you're the big shot
that didn't know whether...

258
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:28,033
Hanover and Dixon were
good enough for your place.

259
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:32,299
That wasn't exactly hay you were
throwing, either. "I'm Linda Mason."

260
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:35,432
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

261
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:38,375
All right, you're a fake and I'm
a phony. And we're both soaked.

262
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,538
Are you hurt?
I'll check later.

263
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:44,413
Come on, let's get out of this
before you catch cold. All right. Oh!

264
00:23:45,652 --> 00:23:49,748
Well, here's what cooks.
Oh!

265
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:54,760
<i>Why, this is darling. Was it as large
as this when it was a farmhouse?</i>

266
00:23:54,828 --> 00:23:59,128
Yeah, it was built by a fellow who felt cramped in New York.
He ran out of lumber, though.

267
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:02,726
<i>- Oh, Mamie!
- Coming!</i>

268
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:10,209
<i>Is your names Mamie? No. No.</i>

269
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:13,177
Get back in the kitchen.

270
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:20,514
My, my, what's happened?
Oh, we had a little accident.

271
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:22,953
Mamie, this is Miss Linda
Mason. How do you do?

272
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:25,651
Pleased to know you, Miss Linda.
And these are her children.

273
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:29,991
<i>There's Daphne and there's
Vanderbilt. How do you do?</i>

274
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:32,361
Mamie, will you take Miss Mason
up to the guest room...

275
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,957
and change her into anything
that'll fit her?

276
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:37,435
Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.

277
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:40,200
I'll see about getting a fire
ready in the living room.

278
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:44,841
Is your names Miss Linda?

279
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:48,039
No.
No.

280
00:24:56,689 --> 00:25:00,455
<i>I don't know. It sounds like
something you'd dream about at night.</i>

281
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:04,793
<i>It would be wonderful. Then you'd wake
up and realize it couldn't work.</i>

282
00:25:04,864 --> 00:25:07,628
Oh, it'll work if I can sell
the idea to some performers.

283
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,294
They seem to think that profit
sharing means taking bows...

284
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,430
on an empty stomach. So that's
why you're not open tonight.

285
00:25:13,506 --> 00:25:17,499
Well, I'm also particular about
the kind of talent I'm going to use.

286
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:21,846
<i>Fifteen holidays a year.
Mm-hmm.</i>

287
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:24,645
You're a lazy fellow.
No, not especially.

288
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:27,345
Just have my own ideas
about living.

289
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,016
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.

290
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:35,061
Never amounted to much,
didn't care.

291
00:25:35,128 --> 00:25:39,462
But as long as he was alive, we always had
plenty to eat and clothes to keep us warm.

292
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:41,466
Were you happy?
Yes.

293
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:45,698
Then your father was a very
successful man. Hope I can do as well.

294
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:48,866
I came out here for a job.
Could you use me?

295
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:51,968
I might find a spot for you.
What can you do?

296
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:54,479
Oh, I sing a little and dance.

297
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:56,981
Couldn't guarantee
any salary at first.

298
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,575
Right now I've got
the ledger in an iron lung.

299
00:25:59,652 --> 00:26:03,052
I don't care if you pay off in eggs. Just
give me a chance. Let's see what you can do.

300
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:06,685
Thanks a lot. I've written
special music for each holiday.

301
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,990
This gives me a chance to keep a
little promise I made to myself.

302
00:26:10,063 --> 00:26:13,226
I said I was going to sing
this song at the inn tonight.

No!

366
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:37,749
Francois, have you seen
Mr. Hanover? Twice, sir.

367
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:40,122
What happened?
The first time, sir,

368
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:42,718
he came from his room with
a telegram in his hand.

369
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:47,232
He ordered scotch and soda, a
bottle of each. I know. What then?

370
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,963
The second time, he asked
which way is "Connect-I-cut."

371
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:53,005
Connecticut.
"Connect-I-cut."

372
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:55,905
He said he has a friend there
who knows about women too.

373
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:58,034
Why didn't you stop him?

374
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,012
How could I stop him, sir, when I
don't know which way is "Connect-I-cut"?

375
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,948
Who said Holiday Inn
wouldn't work?

376
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:09,818
We're gonna divvy up a stack
of money tonight, huh? Man, man!

377
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:12,756
I've got a landlady who's gonna
ask for your autographed picture.

379
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:19,192

405
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:07,631

Come on, Jim, you gotta dance.

406
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:11,006
Oh, you gotta dance with me. Come
on, you gotta dance. No, I can't. Oh!

407
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:45,204
<i>Why, Mr. Hanover!
That's Ted Hanover.</i>

408
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:49,077
Wait a minute. I gotta go.
I don't want Ted Hanover.

409
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:52,606
I want you. This is
New Year's, kid. I know.

410
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:17,257
Ted!

411
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:20,560
He wasn't drunk. It's
a gag. What happened?

412
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:23,568
Ted Hanover with his new
partner. They were great!

413
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,661
New partner?

414
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:35,647
You'd better get back. I'm
sorry. If I'd known how he was...

415
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:39,650
Oh, he'll be all right in a week
or ten days. You'd better hurry.

416
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:50,059
Ted! Ted!

417
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:54,361
Ted! Oh. How is he?

418
00:37:54,433 --> 00:37:56,367
He's out cold.

419
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:59,700
Hot or cold, he can keep
his dancing shoes in my office.

420
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:02,468
Did you hear that applause?
Yeah, it went pretty good.

421
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:06,272
And I was worried about his
losing Lila. Losing Lila?

422
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:09,371
Yeah, she eloped tonight
with some Texan from Texas...

423
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,916
with Ted's engagement ring
on her finger.

424
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:16,045
But who cares? You lose one girl,
you find another. That's life.

425
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:20,114
That's good, huh?
Here we go again.

426
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,430
Come in! Oh.

427
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:37,566
Good morning, Ted.
Good mor... Ooh.

428
00:38:37,643 --> 00:38:41,306
Got a little head?
Say, where am I?

429
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,907
You're in Holiday Inn. How'd
I get here? Who brought me?

430
00:38:44,984 --> 00:38:48,283
You were clinging to the
undercarriage of a jeep, I think.

431
00:38:48,354 --> 00:38:51,255
Here, have a slug
out of the mug.

432
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:54,952
You mean, you don't
remember anything? Uh...

433
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:58,986
let's see,
I had a wire from Lila...

434
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:01,999
telling me she was gonna marry
some millionaire or something.

435
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:05,230
Yeah. I remember that all
right. Uh, then I had a drink.

436
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:08,068
<i>A drink?
Boy, you were fractured.</i>

437
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,077
And then, uh, I decided
I had to talk to my old palJim.

438
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:16,046
You don't remember anything
else? No, that's all.

439
00:39:16,115 --> 00:39:20,176
Except that I... must have been killed
on the way out here or something.

440
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:24,416
You really come up empty, huh?
Too bad about Lila.

441
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,584
I think you're better off doing
a single. You're a born soloist.

442
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,220
Oh, no, no, Jim. I've got to have
a partner. And when I find her...

443
00:39:30,296 --> 00:39:32,696
Yeah, I know, you'll
fall in love with her.

444
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:35,529
Happy New Year!
Oh, don't do that.

445
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:38,365
Why didn't you tell me?

446
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:40,769
Letting me worry
about his losing Lila,

447
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,740
and all the time he's got
this girl on the leash.

448
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:47,404
What girl?
Boy, you must've been high.

449
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:51,176
Doing a complete dance routine
with your new partner and you...

450
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,276
You don't know who she is?

451
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:57,686
I danced with a new partner?
When? Where?

452
00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:01,385
Here! Last night!
Think, Ted.

453
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,587
Remember?

454
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:07,393
<i>Wait a minute I remember.</i>

455
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:11,562
<i>I got here just about midnight.
There was a girl.</i>

456
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:14,996
We danced.

457
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:17,269
What'd she look like?

458
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,937
Oh... I don't know.

459
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,947
<i>All I sa was a vague outline.</i>

460
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,575
Can't you remember
anything about her?

461
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,915
Well, I remember
dancing with her.

462
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:31,013
If I ever dance with her again,
I'd probably recognize her.

463
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,287
Great. That takes care of
everything but finding her.

464
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,523
You were here. Why ask me how she
looked? I only saw her from the back.

465
00:40:37,596 --> 00:40:41,362
She was a... About this...
She had a...

466
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:44,459
If I ever saw her from the
back again, I'd recognize her.

467
00:40:44,536 --> 00:40:46,868
Well, that's fine.
After I've danced with her,

468
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:49,601
I just turn her around
for your okay.

469
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:51,870
This should be a cinch.

470
00:40:51,944 --> 00:40:53,878
You saw her.

471
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:58,645
<i>Describe her. Who, me? Well,
I wasn't watching very closely.</i>

472
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:03,381
She was a medium... medium-built
sort of a girl with a medium face.

473
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:06,424
She had a... a nice evening
gown on with a belt in the back.

474
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:08,722
She was built just like
a girlfriend of mine,

475
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:11,729
a girl you don't know, but...
her name was Consuela Schlepkiss.

476
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:14,664
She used to play the pinball
machine at the drugstore.

477
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,702
<i>She was high ma
three weeks in a row.</i>

478
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,432
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

479
00:41:20,506 --> 00:41:23,304
That's nothing at all.
Happy to do it for you.

480
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:28,108
Say, I've got a hunch, fellas, we're
gonna find this girl eventually.

481
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,910
And when we do,
we'll be glad we waited for her.

482
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:34,919
Listen, I'm not interested in
getting any other partner, understand?

483
00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:37,285
A chance meeting in the night.

484
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:40,655
Destiny.
She'll be back.

485
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:44,594
<i>Here's where we'll find he
on the next holiday. Here?</i>

486
00:41:44,663 --> 00:41:46,756
Here.

487
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:49,630
I've got to go turn the roast.

488
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:43,316
Now don't worry.
We'll find her.

489
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:46,323
If I see her from the back
again, I'll recognize her.

490
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:49,656
It's kind of a roundabout way
to go at it, but let's try it.

491
00:43:06,945 --> 00:43:09,106
<i Are you decent?

492
00:43:09,181 --> 00:43:12,344
Yes, come in.

493
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:15,250
What's that?
Well, I thought it over,

494
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,754
and I believe our number
would go better in blackface.

495
00:43:17,823 --> 00:43:20,383
Oh, I thought we were
gonna do it like this.

496
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:23,860
Well, that was before I...
before I thought it over.

497
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:26,056
I'll look terrible in the stuff. No.

498
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:28,964
I don't even know how to put
it on. I'll put it on for you.

499
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:33,232
I broke in as a bootblack,
you know. Here we go.

500
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:37,071
Oh!
For a month and a half...

501
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:40,373
I've been dreaming how pretty
I was going to look tonight.

502
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:43,710
Well, here's my punishment
for thinking so well of myself.

503
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:46,182
Oh, you'll have plenty
of times to be pretty.

504
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:49,482
I was just going to ask you to be
in the rest of the shows out here.

505
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:52,149
You were?
Will you?

506
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:55,250
Will I?
Fifteen nights a year...

507
00:43:55,327 --> 00:44:00,264
Cinderella steps into her pumpkin
coach and becomes queen of Holiday Inn.

508
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:03,501
What's the matter?

509
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:08,199
I wish I didn't have to work all the other
days in the year to make these few possible.

510
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:11,071
Maybe a little later on
when we start doing better,

511
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:13,976
you can stay out here
all the time.

512
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:16,879
Did you hear
what you just said?

513
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:20,476
Yeah.
Was it a proposal?

514
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:23,919
Well, it will be when I get
a few bucks in the bank.

515
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:27,117
Well, you're a strange duck.

516
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:30,525
You don't even give me a chance to say
"darling" and throw my arms around you.

517
00:44:30,596 --> 00:44:33,497
You'd better save that
till you see the bank book.

518
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:38,332
Well, I guess
I'm sort of engaged.

519
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,988
Say, what is this,
a daisy chain?

520
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:06,121
Uh... well...

521
00:45:06,198 --> 00:45:09,929
we were just looking for the
back of a girl we don't know.

Good night.

567
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:36,737
I give up.
She's not here tonight.

568
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:39,743
You wait here. I'll go up
and see ifJim's seen her.

569
00:48:39,811 --> 00:48:42,245
Gus is waiting to take you
to the station.

570
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:45,477
Remember, day after tomorrow,
St. Valentine's Day.

571
00:48:47,118 --> 00:48:49,746
Someone's coming. Use the
other stairway. Well, who is it?

572
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:51,755
Bill collector.
Oh.

573
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:05,770
Good night.
Good night, Jim.

574
00:49:05,837 --> 00:49:09,864
You'd better get inside before you
catch cold. You haven't got a coat.

575
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:12,409
Well, I...
Go on.

576
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:16,879
I don't need a coat now.

577
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:22,752
<i>Hey, Ted did you find the girl?</i>

578
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:25,790
This is terrible. I wish we could
recognize her from the front.

579
00:49:25,857 --> 00:49:27,950
I feel like a wolf.
Ted!

580
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:40,199
Ted!

581
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:43,536
Ted!

582
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:47,601
She's here! I saw her!
This way! Let go! Who?

583
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,613
Shortcut, come on!

584
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:52,172
Giddap!

585
00:49:57,055 --> 00:49:59,853
Why, it's locked. It's never
been locked before. Oh, me!

586
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:02,120
Let's try the other stairway.

587
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:05,128
Let go of me!
Go ahead.

588
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:14,534
Well, we've lost her again. Did you
get a look at her face this time?

589
00:50:14,606 --> 00:50:17,336
No. We're still
working from the rear.

590
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:19,673
How do you know it was
her? She had an overcoat on.

591
00:50:19,744 --> 00:50:23,475
I don't care if she ha... How do
you know she had an overcoat on?

592
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:27,814
Well, she... If she didn't,
look for a girl with pneumonia.

593
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:30,480
Come on, let's get inside.

594
00:50:31,556 --> 00:50:34,024
Say, um, Jim,
when's your next show?

595
00:50:34,092 --> 00:50:37,220
Next show? Uh, St.
Valentine's Day, I think.

596
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:39,763
Ooh, the day after tomorrow, huh? Is it?

597
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,629
That's a break. We'll get here
early and stay until we find her.

598
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:45,295
We'll make an announcement
asking her to identify herself.

599
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,306
We won't miss next time. No. Say,
fellas, how'd you like the show?

600
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:53,401
Well, we were so busy we
didn't see much of it, Jim. Why?

601
00:50:53,478 --> 00:50:57,073
Thought the people seemed to like
the blackface routine. Yeah, they did.

602
00:50:57,148 --> 00:51:00,584
Don't you think a blackface number
on St. Valentine's Day'd be novel?

603
00:51:00,652 --> 00:51:04,088
A what? It's no good,
huh? Just an idea I had.

604
00:51:04,155 --> 00:51:07,591
Well, good-bye.
Good-bye. So long, Jim.

605
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,431
<i>Hey, lady!
Yes?</i>

606
00:51:22,507 --> 00:51:25,442
We open in an hour. You
haven't even had a rehearsal.

607
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,944
<i>Coming.</i>

608
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:30,106
Oh, very smart.

609
00:51:30,181 --> 00:51:32,945
You'll have to talk Gus into
buying a horseless carriage.

610
00:51:33,018 --> 00:51:36,044
I spend half my life between
here and the station.

611
00:51:36,121 --> 00:51:39,352
Gus'll have to face the machine
age sooner or later, won't he?

612
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:44,227
Did you escape those bill collectors
the other night? Bill colle...

613
00:51:44,295 --> 00:51:47,321
Oh, yes, temporarily. That reminds me,
I got a surprise for you downstairs.

614
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:49,924
Well, thanks. What reminds you? Nothing.

615
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:52,765
It's just, uh, I want you
to remember the surprise...

616
00:51:52,837 --> 00:51:55,305
when those doggone
bill collectors move in.

617
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:58,774
You sound sweet, but
you don't make sense.

618
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:06,245
Oh, the inn is
so romantic-looking!

619
00:52:06,317 --> 00:52:10,048
I posed for
those Cupids myself.

620
00:52:10,121 --> 00:52:13,579
Hello, boys.
Hello, Linda. Hi, Jim.

621
00:52:13,658 --> 00:52:15,922
A lot of paid-up
cards here tonight.

622
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:19,020
Where's the surprise?
Aha, right here.

623
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:22,794
A little home cookin'
I whipped up.

624
00:52:24,836 --> 00:52:27,634
Beautiful.

625
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:33,341
"Be careful it's my heart."

626
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:37,074
And I ain't kiddin' either. I

Sorry, Jim,
I couldn't resist it.

659
00:56:13,131 --> 00:56:15,395
Wonderful! She's perfect.
Light as a feather.

660
00:56:15,466 --> 00:56:18,060
You found her. Jim, you're a pal. Yeah!

661
00:56:18,136 --> 00:56:20,900
Do you realize we've been
searching for you for weeks?

662
00:56:20,972 --> 00:56:23,941
For me?
Yes! Ever since...

663
00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:27,102
The girl in the flower
shop. Yes, Mr. Reed.

664
00:56:27,178 --> 00:56:31,478
Where have you been working
since New Year's Eve? Here.

665
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:34,985
<i>- Would you min letting me in on your secret?
- It's no secret.</i>

666
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:38,420
Ted Hanover is looking for a dancing
partner. We've decided to give you the job.

667
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:40,923
Now wait just a minute!
No hard feelings, Jim.

668
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:44,621
I don't blame you for trying. She's wonderful.
I feel as if I'd known her for months.

669
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:46,960
Oh, same old feeling, huh?

670
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:50,762
Washington's Birthday is the
next show. That'll give us a week.

671
00:56:50,835 --> 00:56:53,702
<i>- We can open the act here.
- I'll take car of the invitations.</i>

672
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:57,104
<i>Strictly formal. I'll get all the newspaper
boys from New York. Hold everything.</i>

673
00:56:57,175 --> 00:57:00,110
This is my inn and I'm not running
it for a bunch of stuffed shirts.

674
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:02,373
What would you like,
the dungaree set?

675
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:06,315
That'd be better than that bunch of chowderheads
you'd drag in. Maybe I can't use the act.

676
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:10,377
- Not use Ted Hanover?
- Well, the show is pretty well set.

677
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:14,915
You're in, but he's out. You could change
the show for a special occasion like this.

678
00:57:14,993 --> 00:57:17,985
Of course he could. He's just
trying to hide his gratitude.

679
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:20,428
Jim, you'd better
think up a number for us.

680
00:57:20,498 --> 00:57:23,160
Well, just what do you
visualize, Ziggy?

681
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,429
Uh, let's see, um...

682
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:29,200
for Washington's Birthday, I see
a sort of a romantic costume thing.

683
00:57:29,273 --> 00:57:32,401
Naturally. Something that just
reeks with grace and charm, you know.

684
00:57:32,477 --> 00:57:35,969
Mm-hmm. I think the music
should be sweet and gentle to...

685
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:40,984
Well, to create the mood each time
I take her into my arms and kiss her.

686
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:45,751
That's it. Don't you think it's

Come in!

704
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:15,588
In spite of what good old Jim tried to do
to us, your future starts as of tonight.

705
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,925
Now, where would you like
to go from here? From here?

706
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:22,432
Yes. New York? Havana? Rio? We
have our pick of engagements.

707
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,061
But I can't be your partner if you
leave the inn. Of course you can.

708
01:02:26,137 --> 01:02:29,163
There's no reason for
you to remain buried here.

709
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,538
There's a very good reason.

710
01:02:31,609 --> 01:02:35,010
I've promised to be in Jim's holiday
shows for the rest of the year.

711
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:38,014
He tricked you into that while
he was hiding you from me.

712
01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:41,074
No matter how he did it,
I promised.

713
01:02:41,152 --> 01:02:43,245
Besides, we're...

714
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,915
Well, we're going to
be married. Married?

715
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:49,289
Now wait a minute! Let's be
fair. He didn't give me a chance.

716
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,760
After all, I love you too.

717
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:54,263
From the very first moment
we danced together,

718
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:56,766
I knew you were to be
the one girl in my life.

719
01:02:56,834 --> 01:02:59,564
But you... you didn't
even know my name.

720
01:02:59,637 --> 01:03:03,596
Please! All right, forget
about me, then. Forget aboutJim.

721
01:03:03,674 --> 01:03:07,201
Think of yourself. Here's your chance
to do the one thing you like best.

722
01:03:07,278 --> 01:03:11,237
Not only for 15 days
a year, but always.

723
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,884
Sorry, but I promised.

724
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:30,600
Well... I guess I should apologize
for hoking up your number, huh?

725
01:03:30,668 --> 01:03:33,933
Oh, forget it. I'm the one
that should apologize to you.

726
01:03:34,004 --> 01:03:36,939
Here I've been trying to
take Linda away from you,

727
01:03:37,007 --> 01:03:40,704
not knowing you two were
going to be married. Married?

728
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:43,008
Yeah. Aren't you?

729
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,379
Yes. Sure. Uh...

730
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:49,283
I mean, naturally
we're sort of engaged.

731
01:03:49,353 --> 01:03:51,878
Oh.

732
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:56,256
Well, um, anyway, I've decided to
bow out of here. Linda's all yours.

733
01:03:56,327 --> 01:03:59,262
Well, you're a pretty game
guy to take it this way.

734
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,731
It's happened so often I'm
getting used to it, that's all.

735
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,360
Good-bye, kid.
Lot of luck, Ted.

736
01:04:05,436 --> 01:04:08,371
Thanks.

737
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:15,709
How are we doing?

738
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,715
Two minutes ago, I would've
sold my chances for a tired dime.

739
01:04:18,783 --> 01:04:21,718
But when a man is surprised to
hear that he's going to be married,

740
01:04:21,786 --> 01:04:23,879
that's when I go to work
with a clear conscience.

741
01:04:23,954 --> 01:04:25,922

770
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:55,470
Hello.

771
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:58,667
I didn't exactly expect
the welcome mat,

772
01:06:58,742 --> 01:07:02,405
but I thought somebody
might say hello. Hello.

773
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:05,539
What brings you here on this
bright and uninviting day?

774
01:07:05,616 --> 01:07:09,882
- I've discovered something, my friends, about life.
- Meaning what?

775
01:07:09,954 --> 01:07:12,889
Well, I don't want success.

776
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:16,017
I want the true happiness you
people have found here at the inn.

777
01:07:16,093 --> 01:07:18,186
You're not gonna stay
in the inn?

778
01:07:18,262 --> 01:07:21,993
Not just stay. I want to be part of
your shows, help you in your work,

779
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:24,193
share your simple pleasures.

780
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:26,964
I asked you once
not to interfere, Ted.

781
01:07:27,037 --> 01:07:30,131
Please believe me, I'm a
tired, lonely and unhappy man,

782
01:07:30,207 --> 01:07:34,166
but I could be happy here helping
the two people I like the best.

783
01:07:34,244 --> 01:07:38,203
Will you take me in? My motherly
intuition tells me to throw him out.

784
01:07:38,282 --> 01:07:42,742
Well, at least give him the benefit of
the doubt. I've given him plenty of doubt.

785
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:47,154
Are you kidding with that"
Sharing life's simple pleasures"?

786
01:07:47,224 --> 01:07:50,523
May I go inside with
you? Why, of course.

787
01:07:50,594 --> 01:07:53,028
My trunks will arrive
this afternoon.

788
01:07:53,097 --> 01:07:55,190
What do I do, move
in the broom closet?

789
01:07:55,265 --> 01:07:58,996
That's no way to talk to a man who's here
to help you. The world doesn't change.

790
01:07:59,069 --> 01:08:03,938
A gentle smile often breeds a kick in
the pants, but for your sake I'll be big.

791
01:08:04,008 --> 01:08:06,943
Hmm.

792
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:28,622
I'll give you a tip, Gus: They'll
go up and back, but not sideways.

793
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:32,465
I keep forgettin' this blame
thing can't see where it's going.

794
01:08:32,536 --> 01:08:36,734
Yeah. Well, unload the rest of
this stuff in the back, huh? Yeah.

795
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:44,847
Hey!

796
01:08:44,915 --> 01:08:47,349
<i>What'd you do get up before
breakfast? Oh, every morning.</i>

797
01:08:47,418 --> 01:08:50,581
When I found out how late you got
in, I told Mamie to let you sleep.

798
01:08:50,654 --> 01:08:53,350
Life on a farm.
Can't beat it, huh?

799
01:08:53,424 --> 01:08:55,949
Jim, you've made me
very happy. That's fine.

800
01:08:56,026 --> 01:08:59,655
How about you making me happy? You sound
like a landlord with eviction papers.

801
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:03,996
This is good news. Lila's back in
New York. I got a letter from her.

802
01:09:04,068 --> 01:09:06,969
What happened to her
millionaire? Slight mistake there.

803
01:09:07,037 --> 01:09:10,939
<i>He didn't own millions, he
owed them. Poor girl.</i>

804
01:09:11,008 --> 01:09:14,102
Always straying to greener
pastures and finding spinach. Yeah.

805
01:09:14,178 --> 01:09:17,147
She was wondering if you'd be interested
in taking her back as a partner.

806
01:09:17,214 --> 01:09:20,411
I think it'd be a great
idea. Naturally, you would.

807
01:09:20,484 --> 01:09:25,444
But I like it here with you and
Linda. Yes, we love having you too.

808
01:09:25,522 --> 01:09:28,889
Uh, when are you leaving?

809
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:41,162
Oh. Oh.

810
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:43,433
Why didn't you say
something? You look so silly.

811
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:45,634
Where's Jim?
Inside.

812
01:09:45,709 --> 01:09:49,702
Good. I fixed it. Here's the news
in one luscious word: Hollywood.

813
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,408
I told you I'm not leaving
until Linda goes with me.

814
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:55,077
But this is the setup you
needed to get her away from Jim.

815
01:09:55,152 --> 01:09:58,747
There are gonna be two Hollywood
men here tonight. One's a director.

816
01:09:58,822 --> 01:10:03,452
<i>If they like your dancing, you and
Linda will be on a train tomorrow.</i>

817
01:10:03,527 --> 01:10:06,291
We'd better find out
if Linda's interested.

818
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:09,355
We let her know when there's a contract
staring her in the face. Look...

819
01:10:09,433 --> 01:10:12,800
I know you're in love but forget
it until we get her away from him.

820
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:15,464
<i>This is no time to be honest.
Well, what should I do?</i>

821
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:20,272
We have to convinceJim that he'd be a heel if
he stood in the way of a chance like this.

822
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:23,575
Well, that'll be easy.
Like peeling a turtle.

823
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:35,753
Mamie says these go up here.
Yes. Set 'em right down.

824
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:41,794
Say, Gus, how'd you
like to earn a slow $10?

825
01:10:41,865 --> 01:10:44,265
Don't care how slow, but sure.

826
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:46,996
It's sure, all right.
Here's the wrinkle:

827
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:51,598
I want you to go to the station, pick up a party
and start for Holiday Inn, but never get here.

828
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:54,007
- Could you handle that?
- Wouldn't be surprised.

829
01:10:54,077 --> 01:10:58,912
Hello? Long distance. That's what
I want you to do with Linda Mason.

830
01:10:58,982 --> 01:11:01,348
Miss Mason?
Our friend?

831
01:11:01,418 --> 01:11:03,784
You're not supposed
to understand it, Gus.

832
01:11:03,854 --> 01:11:07,756
With that kind of money, you oughta
be able to go by way of Medicine Hat.

833
01:11:07,825 --> 01:11:10,760
Hello? Yeah.
Just a minute.

834
01:11:12,896 --> 01:11:16,889
Long distance. I want to get
Parkway Hotel, New York City.

835
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:19,060
Miss Lila Dixon.

836
01:11:41,558 --> 01:11:44,152
Didn't Linda say she'd
be here for rehearsal?

837
01:11:44,228 --> 01:11:47,857
Oh, relax. Our audiences
aren't professional critics.

838
01:12:04,014 --> 01:12:07,450
Gus, you made a wrong turn. Shortcut.

839
01:12:10,988 --> 01:12:15,357
Gus! Shortcut... to the shortcut.

840
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:34,036
How could you possibly
expect to drive through this?

841
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:38,241
I never had no trouble
with a horse.

842
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:43,047
You'd better carry me to shore,
and I'll walk back to the highway.

843
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,419
I think you'd be better off
waitin' right here.

844
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:50,119
Gus, will you please
do as I say?

845
01:12:50,193 --> 01:12:53,060
Oh, all right.

846
01:12:58,335 --> 01:13:01,634
The other way! Turn around! Huh?

847
01:13:01,705 --> 01:13:04,333
Gus, turn around! Oh! Oh!

848
01:13:04,408 --> 01:13:06,876
Oh!

849
01:13:08,045 --> 01:13:10,275
Gus!
Oh! Oh!

850
01:13:10,347 --> 01:13:13,475
Oh, my hat!

851
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:16,178
Ya pushed me!
Get my hat!

852
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:26,328
I swear the show will start any
minute now. You said that an hour ago.

853
01:13:26,396 --> 01:13:30,423
Yeah, but this time
I'm sincere. Excuse me.

854
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,491
Who started the show? I did. You're on.

855
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,393
What about Ted's partner? You've
kept this crowd waiting long enough.

856
01:13:59,463 --> 01:14:02,343
He can go on without her. Have you
gone nuts? I rehearsed a double dance!

Will you give me a lift?
Sure. Hop in.

906
01:17:17,594 --> 01:17:21,257
Aren't you Ted Hanover's
former dancing partner?

907
01:17:21,331 --> 01:17:25,165
Yes, although I wouldn't
exactly say "former."

908
01:17:25,235 --> 01:17:28,102
I'm dancing with him
at the inn tonight.

909
01:17:28,171 --> 01:17:31,572
But I... Doesn't he
have a new partner?

910
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:34,769
Oh, she won't be there tonight.

911
01:17:34,844 --> 01:17:38,302
I didn't know that.
I-I work at the inn.

912
01:17:38,381 --> 01:17:41,509
Oh? Waitress?

913
01:17:42,819 --> 01:17:47,017
Yes. I know your boss,
Jim Hardy, quite well.

914
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,752
<i>Quite well.</i>

915
01:17:49,826 --> 01:17:53,887
<i>He's responsible for your
rejoining Mr. Hanover? Uh-huh.</i>

916
01:17:53,964 --> 01:17:56,899
By the way, if I were you,
I'd look my prettiest tonight.

917
01:17:56,967 --> 01:18:01,199
Jim says there'll be men there from Hollywood
to consider Ted and me for pictures.

918
01:18:01,271 --> 01:18:06,208
Mr. Hanover's other partner will be
missing this chance to go to Hollywood.

919
01:18:06,276 --> 01:18:10,212
Yes, although she can't be very talented
or they wouldn't be working at the inn.

920
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,841
Ted and I played
only the best places.

921
01:18:15,285 --> 01:18:17,913
Listen, you're late
for the show already.

922
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:22,755
If you'd care to let me drive, I know a shortcut
that'll get us there 15 minutes sooner.

923
01:18:28,265 --> 01:18:31,359
There's a farmhouse near here, and I'll
have us towed out in a couple of minutes.

924
01:18:31,434 --> 01:18:34,369
For the love of mud,
hurry! Wait right here!

925
01:18:34,437 --> 01:18:37,372
<i>What else can I do?</i>

926
01:18:41,645 --> 01:18:44,409
You're on now.

927
01:18:44,481 --> 01:18:46,972
But Linda isn't here yet.
You've got to save the pieces.

928
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:49,610
Keep those men interested now
and do a number with Linda later.

929
01:18:49,686 --> 01:18:52,280
What can I do?
Well, fake something.

930
01:18:52,355 --> 01:18:54,255
Fake something.

931
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:03,961
There's your cue! Don't
fail me! Keep 'em flying!

932
01:19:04,034 --> 01:19:06,798
I'll keep 'em flying.

933
01:22:15,024 --> 01:22:19,791
Linda! What happened to
you? Bad job of sabotage.

934
01:22:21,564 --> 01:22:23,964
Excuse me.

935
01:22:26,536 --> 01:22:31,030
Well, Jim, you deliberately kept me from
working at the inn tonight, didn't you? Yeah.

936
01:22:31,107 --> 01:22:34,634
You knew there would be men here from Hollywood
who might offer me a chance in pictures.

937
01:22:34,711 --> 01:22:39,648
You decided I shouldn't have that opportunity,
not even the opportunity to refuse.

938
01:22:39,716 --> 01:22:43,311
I was afraid the offer might be
too important for you to turn down.

939
01:22:43,386 --> 01:22:46,184
The point is you don't trust
me to make my own decisions...

940
01:22:46,256 --> 01:22:48,986
because they might interfere
with your own selfish plans.

941
01:22:49,058 --> 01:22:52,221
I've had about enough
of that, Jim.

942
01:22:52,295 --> 01:22:54,160
Ted! Linda!

943
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:57,893
Mr. Parker, Mr. Dunbar, I want you to meet
the greatest dance team in show business:

944
01:22:57,967 --> 01:23:00,527
Hanover and Mason
and the owner, Jim Hardy.

945
01:23:00,603 --> 01:23:03,071
Nice little place
you've got here.

946
01:23:03,139 --> 01:23:05,869
Even though you haven't seen Miss
Mason dance, I can assure you...

947
01:23:05,942 --> 01:23:09,878
Hardy, Hollywood is always interested in
new ideas and we think this is a honey.

948
01:23:09,946 --> 01:23:12,312
We'd like to do a picture
based on Holiday Inn.

949
01:23:12,382 --> 01:23:15,408
<i>The idea behind it, how it
works, the special holiday songs.</i>

950
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:19,581
It's purely a speculative thing, far from
foolproof and we can't afford to pay too much.

951
01:23:19,656 --> 01:23:23,524
You don't have to start talking it
down because the idea is not for sale.

952
01:23:23,593 --> 01:23:27,859
We expect to use Mr. Hanover
and his partner in the picture.

953
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:32,834
I don't know how the others feel, but I'd
like to keep this setup just the way it is.

954
01:23:32,902 --> 01:23:35,996
Jim, would you be decent just once and
let somebody else here have a chance?

955
01:23:36,072 --> 01:23:39,439
Wait a minute, Danny. The place
belongs to him. He can do as he wants.

956
01:23:39,509 --> 01:23:42,342
I guess it was just
too good to last, huh?

957
01:23:42,412 --> 01:23:45,381
A simple little layout where we could
do our best at the work we know...

958
01:23:45,448 --> 01:23:48,417
without having
any illusions of glory.

959
01:23:48,484 --> 01:23:52,181
But I can see now that I'm the
only one who could be happy here.

960
01:23:52,255 --> 01:23:55,622
Go ahead, take the idea. Take the music,
take Linda, take the whole darned thing.

961
01:23:55,692 --> 01:23:58,889
<i>But what about you? We'll need you in
Hollywood to write the rest of the music.</i>

962
01:23:58,962 --> 01:24:03,023
Oh, no. I work right here. I'll
send you the music when it's written.

963
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:06,432
And don't bother me
before, huh?

964
01:24:06,502 --> 01:24:09,938
<i>I guess maybe I was
a little selfish, huh?</i>

965
01:24:10,006 --> 01:24:14,466
Is that the deal you wanted, or
should I have thrown in my shirt?

966
01:24:14,544 --> 01:24:17,809
Chummy sort of a fella,
isn't he?

967
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,316
Listen, Linda, if you
really want to stay here...

968
01:24:21,384 --> 01:24:24,876
Don't talk that way! This is
the chance you wanted, isn't it?

969
01:24:24,954 --> 01:24:28,549
Of course!
Boy, are we happy!

970
01:27:06,015 --> 01:27:08,381
Happy Thanksgiving,
Mr. Jim.

971
01:27:08,451 --> 01:27:11,352
Same to you, Mamie...
and staff.

972
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:13,888
Didn't I tell you children
to stay in the kitchen?

973
01:27:13,956 --> 01:27:17,722
Those wings ain't gonna
fly away. Now shoo! Git!

974
01:27:19,128 --> 01:27:22,564
Everything's ready and hot,

01:28:57,693 --> 01:29:00,253
Who is this?
That's Mr. Jones.

996
01:29:00,329 --> 01:29:03,230
Jonesy? I'm sorry.
I knew him too well.

997
01:29:03,299 --> 01:29:08,931
But you've got to eat. The trouble
ain't with that turkey. It's you!

998
01:29:09,005 --> 01:29:12,031
I feel all right.
I'm riding high, Mamie.

999
01:29:12,108 --> 01:29:15,976
Why'd you close the inn and sit around
like a jellyfish with the misery?

1000
01:29:16,045 --> 01:29:21,415
'Cause a slicker stole your gal and you
ain't got fight enough to get her back!

1001
01:29:21,484 --> 01:29:24,317
Um, excuse me,
Mr. Jim, but...

1002
01:29:24,387 --> 01:29:29,324
I tried to keep her here. What kind
of keeping is that? Nothing but tricks!

1003
01:29:29,392 --> 01:29:34,455
If you went to Hollywood and told
Miss Linda how much you loves her,

1004
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:38,523
and told her that the way
a lady likes to hear it told,

1005
01:29:38,601 --> 01:29:43,868
I'll betcha she'd be the quickest
ex-movie star that ever ex'd.

1006
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:48,309
<i>You're crazy, Mamie.
I'm crazy?</i>

1007
01:29:48,377 --> 01:29:53,747
I knows Miss Linda. I knows
her like I knows my own kids.

1008
01:29:53,816 --> 01:29:57,252
Why, she ain't the fancy type
no more than you are.

1009
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,812
What she wants is
what you got right here.

1010
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:04,986
But women has to have them
things told to 'em the right way.

1011
01:30:05,061 --> 01:30:08,724
You could melt her heart
right down to butter...

1012
01:30:08,798 --> 01:30:11,767
if you'd only turn on the heat.

1013
01:30:11,834 --> 01:30:15,429
Mamie, you don't, you don't try to
take a fella's gal away from him...

1014
01:30:15,504 --> 01:30:18,962
after he's bought the ring.

1015
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:22,875
Or, as I recall, do
you? Now you're talkin'

1016
01:30:22,945 --> 01:30:27,348
Sure! Women has to be told
things the right way. Yes, sir!

1017
01:30:40,329 --> 01:30:44,060
At last! The night I've been
dreaming about, actually here.

1018
01:30:44,133 --> 01:30:47,227
This is my wedding. You
make me feel like a kibitzer.

1019
01:30:47,303 --> 01:30:50,238
Don't misunderstand me. I'm happy
because this marriage means...

1020
01:30:50,306 --> 01:30:53,002
that we can all settle down
and stop worrying.

1021
01:30:53,075 --> 01:30:55,509
I wish I had your confidence
without your viewpoint.

1022
01:30:55,578 --> 01:30:59,014
My fingers are crossed until Linda
and I are on that plane bound for Yuma.

1023
01:30:59,081 --> 01:31:02,812
What's worrying you? I've been
this close to marriage before,

1024
01:31:02,885 --> 01:31:06,343
only to wake and find myself
with no bride and a hangover.

1025
01:31:06,422 --> 01:31:10,358
<i>Look, the girl has said yes, the
picture finishes tonight.</i>

1026
01:31:10,426 --> 01:31:13,361
Come in. Everything
is all set and ready.

1027
01:31:13,429 --> 01:31:16,455
What could possibly happen...

1028
01:31:16,532 --> 01:31:19,899
Hi, fellas.

1029
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,834
<i>Jim! Wh-What
brought you here?</i>

1030
01:31:23,906 --> 01:31:27,364
Train. Chug-chug-chug-chug.
Wedding? When is it?

1031
01:31:27,443 --> 01:31:29,377
Wedding?
Yeah.

1032
01:31:29,445 --> 01:31:32,505
Uh, well, we hadn't set
an exact time.

1033
01:31:32,581 --> 01:31:35,072
Have you seen Linda?
No. No, not yet.

1034
01:31:35,151 --> 01:31:38,609
Say, I saw your director. He told me
he was shooting the finale tonight.

1035
01:31:38,687 --> 01:31:41,781
Thought I'd like to see how you
make pictures. Uh, he wouldn't...

1036
01:31:41,857 --> 01:31:44,792
Y - You wouldn't like what
they're doing tonight. Why not?

1037
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:48,694
That's dull, technical stuff. Well,
I'm a dull, technical sort of a fella.

1038
01:31:48,764 --> 01:31:52,632
Perhaps if you'd wait and
see Linda tomorrow. Oh, no!

1039
01:31:52,701 --> 01:31:57,764
I want to see the finish. The success
of you and Linda means a lot to me, pal.

1040
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,503
Say, why don't you be
yourself? What are you up to?

1041
01:32:01,577 --> 01:32:03,841
Well, I'm a son of a gun.

1042
01:32:03,913 --> 01:32:06,848
This is a beautiful hunk of welcome
for a guy who comes coast to coast...

1043
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:10,875
just to wish you a merry
Christmas and a happy wedding.

1044
01:32:10,953 --> 01:32:14,480
Remember how I suspected you when
you came to the inn on Easter morning?

1045
01:32:14,557 --> 01:32:17,856
That was silly, wasn't it? Now
I know he's up to something.

1046
01:32:17,927 --> 01:32:20,521
Wait a minute. Let's not be unfair. Huh?

1047
01:32:20,596 --> 01:32:23,861
We're treating Jim like a poor country
cousin. He doesn't mean any harm.

1048
01:32:23,933 --> 01:32:26,333
No. No. He just wants to see Linda.

1049
01:32:26,402 --> 01:32:30,099
Let's show him Linda! Good
will on earth toward men!

1050
01:32:30,172 --> 01:32:34,541
Where are we going?
What's this? Hey!

1051
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:36,908
Hey, Ted, what is this?

1052
01:32:36,979 --> 01:32:39,914
I was afraid you'd gone
crazy. I'll keep him here...

1053
01:32:39,982 --> 01:32:42,542
<i>till you get Lind
on that plane.</i>

1054
01:32:44,453 --> 01:32:46,546
<i
I'd better get my clothes on.

1055
01:32:46,622 --> 01:32:50,285
<i>I'll go on the set and see how near ready
they are. My clothes are in there!</i>

1056
01:32:50,359 --> 01:32:52,919
- Merry Christmas!
- Jim! Pal!

1057
01:32:52,995 --> 01:32:56,431
Wait! Stop! We were only fooling!

1058
01:32:56,499 --> 01:32:59,662
Only you could think
of a thing like that.

1059
01:33:06,675 --> 01:33:09,610
Who're you calling?
Nobody.

1060
01:33:09,678 --> 01:33:12,272
The operator's gone.

1061
01:33:42,845 --> 01:33:47,043
Take it easy.
Don't break your neck.

1062
01:33:51,887 --> 01:33:55,323
It's one of the most authentic
reproduction jobs we've ever done. Is it?

1063
01:33:55,391 --> 01:33:59,919
And all worked out from those photographs
we took of your place in Connecticut.

1064
01:33:59,995 --> 01:34:05,194
Oh! Well, Mamie and the kids oughta
see this. They'd never believe it.

1065
01:34:05,267 --> 01:34:09,397
Anything wrong? Well, that Christmas
tree is a little out of place.

1066
01:34:09,471 --> 01:34:13,237
I guess nobody'd notice that
but me or... Linda.

1067
01:34:13,309 --> 01:34:16,472
We're going to start rolling. Come along
with me where you can see everything.

1068
01:34:16,545 --> 01:34:19,571
No. I'll just stay in the background.
I don't want to get in your way.

1069
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:23,584
Well, suit yourself.
I'll see you later. Right.

1070
01:34:42,137 --> 01:34:45,664
All right, we're going to follow you
on the boom from here inside the inn.

1071
01:34:45,741 --> 01:34:48,676
When you get in the
other set, do your song.

1072
01:34:48,744 --> 01:34:52,180
I think you have the mood. Your
Hollywood success was empty,

1073
01:34:52,248 --> 01:34:56,309
you've lost the one man you
love; you know, the usual hoke.

1074
01:34:56,385 --> 01:34:59,320
Just make me cry and you
can get to that wedding.

1075
01:34:59,388 --> 01:35:02,448
All ready for rehearsal!
No, please. Let's shoot it.

1076
01:35:02,524 --> 01:35:05,960
Okay.
It's a take!

1077
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:11,363
All right, everybody, quiet
on the stage. It's a take.

1078
01:35:11,433 --> 01:35:14,095
Close 'em up!

1079
01:35:14,169 --> 01:35:18,196
<i>Come on over there. Quiet down.
Let's get settled, everybody.</i>

1080
01:35:20,376 --> 01:35:23,777
<i>Come on, everybody, let's get
settled now. It's the picture.</i>

1081
01:35:23,846 --> 01:35:27,577
Get out of here with your
brooms. Hit your snow!

1082
01:35:28,651 --> 01:35:31,017
<i>All right, roll 'em!</i>

1083
01:35:37,026 --> 01:35:41,326
Sorry, but when the red light's on, you
couldn't get in even if you owned the studio.

1084
01:35:41,397 --> 01:35:44,093
But, pop, this is important.
I know. So is the light.

1085
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:47,226
Hit your playback!
Music!

1086
01:35:50,472 --> 01:35:53,270
