片名:搏擊俱樂部

3
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,840
總是有人問我認不認識泰勒 德頓
People always ask me if I know Tyler Durden.

4
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,530
還有三分鐘
Three minutes.

5
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,510
精彩時刻就要到了 一切重新回到原來的起點
This is it. Ground zero.

6
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,980
你想說幾句話紀念這個偉大的時刻嗎?
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

7
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,520
嘴裡含著槍 只能支支唔唔的
With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.

8
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,920
我還是沒想到要說什麼
I can't think of anything.

9
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,750
我差點忘了泰勒控制著破壞行動
For a second, I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing

10
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,000
不知道那把槍有多髒
and I wonder how clean that gun is.

11
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,390
越來越刺激了
It's getting exciting now.

12
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,430
俗話說 人們總會傷害他所愛的人
That old thing, how you always hurt the one you love.

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,400
其實人們也會愛上他所傷害的人
Well, it works both ways.

14
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,230
這出爆破戲 我們坐在最前排
We have front-row seats for this theater of mass destruction.

15
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:46,320
大破壞計畫準備炸毀12棟樓
The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundations of 12 buildings with explosives.

16
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,020
2 分鐘後 炸彈就會被引爆
In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges

17
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,920
好幾條街都會處於悶燒的狀態
and a few blocks will be reduced to smouldering rubble.

18
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,110
我知道這些 是因為泰勒他知道這些
I know this because Tyler knows this.

19
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,350
還有兩分鐘半 想想我們過去的成就吧
Two and a half. Think of everything we've accomplished.

20
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,560
突然間我終於明白了
Suddenly I realize that all of this,

21
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,030
槍 炸彈 革命...
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,

22
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,340
都跟瑪拉辛格這女人有關
has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.

23
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,470
鮑伯有大奶奶
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.

24
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,550
這是睾丸癌患者的安撫團體
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.

25
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,550
這個把我抱了個滿懷的就是鮑伯
The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.

26
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,650
我們都還是男人
We're still men.

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,550
沒錯 我們是男人
Yes, we're men.

28
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,760
我們就是男人
Men is what we are.

29
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,430
鮑伯8個月前切除了睾丸 接著做荷爾蒙治療
Eight months ago Bob had his testicles removed. Then hormone therapy.

30
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,170
他的睾丸激素太高 刺激雌激素
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high

31
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,300
所以他長了奶子
and his body upped the oestrogen.

32
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,460
－ 這裡很適合我...  - 他們又要切開我胸部減胸了
- That was where I fit... - They'll have to drain my pecs again.

33
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,760
頭被埋在這麼大的奶子中間
...between those huge sweating tits

34
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,570
不禁認為上帝的胸部也很壯觀
that hung enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big.

35
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,370
換你哭了
OK, you cry now.

36
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,050
先等等 讓我從頭說起
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

37
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,480
6個月來我都沒法閉眼
For six months, I couldn't sleep.

38
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,900
失眠症讓我感受不到真實
With insomnia, nothing's real.

39
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,890
一切都很虛幻
Everything's far away.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,290
事情都成了相同的拷貝
Everything's a copy of a copy

41
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,300
探索外太空會找到一堆企業
When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything.

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,400
IBM星球
The IBM Stellar Sphere.

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,940
微軟銀河系
The Microsoft Galaxy.

44
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,640
星巴克星球
The Planet Starbucks.

45
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,410
我要你到外地去處理些疑難雜症
I need you out of town this week to cover some red flags.

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,880
今天一定是星期二
It must have been Tuesday.

47
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,010
因為他系著藍色矢車菊領帶
He had on his cornflower blue tie.

48
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,280
我暫時放下手頭的工作?
You want me to deprioritize my reports...

49
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,790
先處理這些事件
until you advise of a status upgrade?

50
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,060
這是機票折價券 如果遇到臨時狀況再通知我
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons. Call me if there's any snags.

51
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,990
他很有精神
He was full of pep.

52
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,960
一定是喝了不少咖啡
Must have had his grande latte enema.

53
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,470
我也是個迷上傢俱裝潢的人
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.

54
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,650
我要訂傢俱防塵腳套
Yes. I'd like to order the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

55
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,400
請等一下
Please hold.

56
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,420
要是看到陰陽形狀的咖啡桌
Anything clever, like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,

57
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,390
我就一定要買到
I had to have it.

58
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,590
整組個人咖啡杯
The Klipsk personal office unit.

59
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,590
家用固定腳踏車
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.

60
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,090
綠色條紋的高級沙發
Or the Ohamshab sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

61
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,860
還有裝著再生紙燈罩的電燈
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.

62
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,200
我翻著產品目錄思考著...
I'd flip through catalogues and wonder

63
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,640
哪種餐具能表現我的個人風格?
"What kind of dining set defines me as a person?"

64
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,710
連有瑕疵的盤子我都買了
I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,

65
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,680
因為它們是純手工製作的
proof that they were crafted by the honest, hard-working, indigenous peoples of...

66
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,050
- 請再稍等片刻  - 管他呢
- Please hold. - ...wherever.

67
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,810
反正我已經等很久了
I was hold.

68
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,690
以前我們看色情圖片尋找刺激
We used to read pornography.

69
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,880
現在是看產品目錄
Now it was the Horchow collection.

70
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,450
失眠症不會死人的
No. You can't die of insomnia.

71
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,990
嗜睡症呢?
What about narcolepsy?

72
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,300
突然睡著 在陌生的地方醒來
I nod off, I wake up in strange places. I have no idea how I got there.

73
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,930
你得放鬆心情
You need to lighten up.

74
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,670
給我些安眠藥吧?
Can you please just give me something?

75
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,260
紅紅藍藍的安眠藥
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...

76
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,980
不行 你需要健康自然的睡眠
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

77
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,080
吃點拔地麻根 多做運動
Chew some valerian root and get more exercise.

78
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,230
別走嘛 我很痛苦啊
Hey, come on. I'm in pain.

79
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,930
星期二到教堂去見識見識真正的痛苦
You wanna see pain? Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

80
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,850
看看那些得了睾丸癌的人
See the guys with testicular cancer.

81
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,360
那才叫痛苦
That's pain.

82
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,980
我一直想要三個孩子
I always wanted three kids...

83
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,380
兩男一女
two boys and a girl.

84
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,850
敏蒂要兩女一男
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

85
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,130
我倆意見一直不合
We never could agree on anything.

86
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,860
她上禮拜生了第一個寶寶
Well, I... She...She had her first child last week.

87
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,260
是女孩
A girl.

88
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,100
是她新任丈夫的
With... With her... With her new husband.

89
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,410
操！
Fuck!

90
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,810
謝天謝地
Thank God, you know...

91
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,170
我真為她高興
I'm glad for her.

92
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,670
因為那是應該的
She deserves...

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,400
謝謝湯瑪斯與我們分享
Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.

94
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,710
謝謝湯瑪斯...
Thank you, Thomas.

95
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,850
我看到各位的勇氣
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage.

96
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,430
也帶給我力量
And that gives me strength.

97
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,830
我們互相給予彼此力量
We give each other strength.

98
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,960
一對一的時間到了
It's time for the one-on-ones.

99
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,120
以湯瑪斯的例子為準則 敞開心胸吧
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example and really open ourselves up.

100
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,160
請各自尋找搭檔
Could you find a partner?

101
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,040
我就是這樣認識大奶奶的
And this is how I met the big moosie.

102
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,310
他的眼睛早就熱淚盈眶
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.

103
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,760
膝蓋摩擦著 小碎步走向我
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.

104
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,320
- 我是鮑伯  - 鮑伯
- My name is Bob. - Bob?

105
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,060
他曾是健美先生
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.

106
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,060
你知道晚間的健胸節目嗎?
You know that chest expansion programme on late-night TV?

107
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,630
那是他提出的主意
That was his idea.

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,150
我曾經使用禁藥
I was a juicer.

109
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,710
就是類固醇
You know, using steroids?

110
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,950
戴伯諾
Diabonal and

111
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,360
威斯特駱
Wisterol.

112
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,870
那是拿來打在賽馬身上的
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes.

113
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,900
我破產了 離婚了
And now I'm bankrupt. I'm divorced.

114
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,320
我的兩個孩子
My two grown kids

115
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,270
他們甚至不肯回電話給我
won't even return my phone calls.

116
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,440
這麼坦白的陌生人 讓我想哭
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.

117
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,870
沒關係 柯納裡斯
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

118
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,070
好好的哭一場吧
You can cry.

119
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,890
接著奇跡發生了
And then... something happened.

120
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,830
我不再壓抑
I let go.

121
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,830
不顧一切
Lost in oblivion.

122
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,960
感到黑暗 沉默和完整
Dark and silent and complete.

123
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,230
我找到了自由 拋開所有希望就是自由
I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.

124
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,410
沒關係
It's OK.

125
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,980
初生的嬰兒都沒有我睡的沉
Babies don't sleep this well.

126
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,990
後來我就上癮了
I became addicted.

127
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,620
"酒精中毒 貪食症團體"

128
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,630
"如何對抗肺結核"

129
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,600
如果我不說話
If I didn't say anything

130
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,040
別人都會以為我快死了
people always assumed the worst.

131
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,740
"遠離病毒"

132
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,940
他們哭得越凶
They cried harder...

133
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,840
我就哭得越凶
then I cried harder.

134
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,480
"皮膚癌 腎臟癌 胃癌"

135
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,190
打開那扇綠門 你的心門
Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra...

136
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,260
我沒有絕症
I wasn't really dying.

137
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,850
也沒有癌症或是寄生菌
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

138
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,670
我只是一個小小的中心
I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.

139
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,200
想像有一道治療你的白光
Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.

140
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,370
那道光在你身上遊移 治療
It moves over your body, healing you.

141
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,990
繼續冥想 別忘了呼吸
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

142
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,350
走向房間的後門
and step forward through the back door of the room.

143
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,620
那道門通往哪裡?
Where does it lead?

144
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,850
到你的洞裡去
To your cave.

145
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,590
走進你的洞裡
Step forward into your cave.

146
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,390
很好
That's right.

147
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,370
走進洞的深處
You're going deeper into your cave.

148
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,920
你會在那裡找到你的精神動物
And you're going to find your power animal.

149
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,140
滑啊
Slide.

150
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,150
我每晚都會死一次
Every evening I died.

151
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,380
可是又重生一次
And every evening I was born again.

152
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,260
復活過來
Resurrected.

153
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,230
鮑伯以為我的睾丸也被切除了
Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.

154
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,340
我靠著他的奶子 準備哭泣
Being there, pressed against his tits, ready to cry.

155
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,970
這簡直是我的假期
This was my vacation.

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,240
但是她...
And she

157
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,370
卻把一切都給毀了
ruined everything.

158
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,750
這是癌症吧?
This is cancer, right?

159
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,810
瑪拉辛格根本沒有睾丸癌
This chick, Marla Singer, did not have testicular cancer.

160
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,820
她是騙子
She was a liar.

161
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,320
她根本沒有病
She had no diseases at all.

162
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,430
週二我還在血癌團體課見過她
I had seen her at Free And Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays.

163
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,100
還有我的鐮狀細胞貧血症團體
Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.

164
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,940
還有"把握今天"
And again, at Seize The Day,

165
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,840
星期五晚上的肺結核團體
my tuberculosis, Friday night.

166
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,440
瑪拉
Marla,

167
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,210
這個到處都去的人
the big tourist.

168
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,580
她的謊言反射出我的謊言
Her lie reflected my lie.

169
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,150
突然間我沒有感覺了
And suddenly, I felt nothing.

170
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,420
我哭不出來了
I couldn't cry.

171
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,290
所以再一次的
So once again,

172
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,860
我睡不著了
I couldn't sleep.

173
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,270
下一節課 在冥想結束後
Next group, after guided meditation,

174
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,520
在敞開心房相互擁抱的時候
after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug,

175
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,670
我要抓著她的手大喊
I'm gonna grab that bitch, Marla Singer, and scream.

176
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,740
"瑪拉 你這個騙子 你給我滾"
Marla, you liar! You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

177
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,320
我4天沒睡了
I hadn't slept in four days.

178
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,790
得失眠症的人無法真正入睡
We'll just let that dry...When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep.

179
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,280
也沒有清醒的時刻
And you're never really awake.

180
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,740
今晚由克蘿伊替我們開場白
To begin tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words.

181
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,640
對了 克蘿伊
Oh, yeah. Chloe.

182
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,455
她是那種讓人看上去...
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would

183
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:19,800
非常有親和力的人
look if you made it walk around being extra nice to everybody.

184
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,020
嗨 我還活著
Well, I'm still here.

185
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,550
可是不知道會活多久
But I don't know for how long.

186
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,950
沒有人能給我正確答案
That's as much certainty as anyone can give me.

187
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,380
但我有個好消息
But I've got some good news.

188
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,720
我不害怕死亡了
I no longer have any fear of death.

189
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,100
可是我現在很孤獨
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

190
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,040
沒有人願意跟我做愛
No-one will have sex with me.

191
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,870
我快死了 我想做最後一次愛
I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

192
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,440
我家裡有A片
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,

193
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,950
- 還有潤滑劑和春藥...  - 謝謝你 克蘿伊
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite. - Thank you, Chloe.

194
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,780
我們謝謝克蘿伊
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

195
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,220
謝謝 克蘿伊
Thank you, Chloe.

196
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,120
我們準備冥想吧
Now, let's ready ourselves for guided meditation.

197
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,200
你站在山洞的入口
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

198
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,670
進入山洞往裡面走
You step inside your cave and you walk...

199
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,470
瑪拉猶如我的癌症
If I did have a tumor,

200
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,410
就像長在嘴邊的爛疽一般
I'd name it Marla.

201
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,400
瑪拉
Marla.

202
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,980
不去舔就不會惡化 但沒辦法不去舔
The scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.

203
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,320
再走深入一點
But you can't.

204
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,990
在你走的同時 感受身邊治療的力量
..deeper into your cave as you walk.

205
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:44,260
你感應到了治癒你的能量 去找你的精神動物
You feel a healing energy all around you. Now find your power animal.

206
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,190
滑啊
Slide.

207
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,270
開始分組吧
OK. Let's partner up.

208
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,600
選一個今晚對你很特別的人
Pick someone special to you tonight.

209
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,500
嘿
Hey.

210
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,420
- 我要跟你談談  - 好啊
- We need to talk. - Sure.

211
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,390
我知道你的底細
I'm onto you.

212
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,020
什麼?
What?

213
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,860
你是假的 你根本不會死
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

214
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,430
你說什麼?
Sorry?

215
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,060
某種觀點看來 我們都會死
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

216
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,340
- 可是你跟克蘿伊的情況不同  - 怎樣?
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is. - So?

217
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,810
你什麼團體都參加
So you're a tourist.

218
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,050
我見過你 你參加過黑腫瘤課 肺結核課
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis.

219
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,780
還有睾丸癌團體
I saw you at testicular cancer!

220
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,090
你演練過了對吧?
I saw you practising this.

221
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,990
演練什麼?
Practising what?

222
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,390
跟我對質的話啊
Telling me off.

223
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,190
結果與你預期一樣嗎? 陸波?
Is it going as well as you hoped...Rupert?

224
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,990
我要揭露你的事
I'll expose you.

225
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,690
去啊 我也會揭露你的事
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

226
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,040
好了 大家一起發洩吧
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

227
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,680
你為什麼要這樣子?
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

228
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,710
這比看電影便宜 還有咖啡喝
It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee.

229
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,980
這是很重要的
Look, this is important.

230
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,080
那些是屬於我的團體 我參加這些團體1年了
These are my groups. I've been coming for over a year.

231
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,600
- 你又是為什麼?  - 不清楚
- Why do you do it? - I don't know.

232
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,300
快死的人 說話特別有份量
When people think you're dying, they listen to you instead of...

233
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,420
別人不敢打斷
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

234
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,630
沒錯
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,580
完全分享你的事
Share yourself... completely.

236
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,340
你不會想繼續下去了 你會上癮的
Look, you don't want to get into this. It becomes an addiction.

237
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,810
真的?
Really?

238
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,840
我說真的
I'm not kidding.

239
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,340
我需要這些課程好好哭泣
I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this.

240
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,350
請你另覓他處
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

241
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,410
那是你的問題 可不關我的事
Candystripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.

242
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,620
等一下 別走
No, wait a second. Hold on.

243
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,460
我們平分好了
We'll split up the week, OK?

244
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,660
淋巴瘤和肺結核給你
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

245
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,730
肺結核給你 我太愛抽煙了
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.

246
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,310
好 睾丸癌沒有爭議吧?
OK. Good. Fine. Testicular cancer should be no contest.

247
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,530
我比你有資格去
Technically, I have more right to be there.

248
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,800
因為你還有睾丸
You still have your balls.

249
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:06,970
你在開玩笑吧?
You're kidding.

250
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,410
你看像嗎?
I dunno. Am I?

251
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,850
不
No. No.

252
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,200
那你要什麼?
What do you want?

253
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,610
寄生菌
I'll take the parasites.

254
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,280
你不能都要 血液寄生菌給你好了
You can't have both. Take the blood parasites.

255
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,500
- 我要腦寄生菌  - 我也要腦寄生菌
- I want brain parasites. - I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

256
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,730
- 我要  - 腦部分很多區 你不能通通去
- I want that. - You can't have the whole brain.

257
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,320
你分到四個 我只分到兩個
So far, you have four. I only have two.

258
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,970
好吧 寄生菌都給你
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

259
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,630
我們兩都各分到三個了
Now we both have three...

260
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,040
你的衣服掉了
Hey! You left half your clothes.

261
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,950
你賣髒衣服?
What, are you selling those?

262
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,890
沒錯 我是賣衣服的
Yes! I'm selling some clothes!

263
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,530
我們各三天 那一共六天
So! We each have three. That's six.

264
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,000
第七天呢? 我要腸癌
What about the seventh day? I want bowel cancer.

265
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,170
她也下過功夫
The girl had done her homework.

266
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,370
我要腸癌
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

267
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
那也是你的最愛? 那麼我們分吧?
That's your favorite too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?

268
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,910
好 我們分配一下 你每個月的單數周去
Look, we'll split it. Take the first and third Sunday.

269
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,190
好
Deal.

270
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,920
看來要道別了
Looks like this is goodbye.

271
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,320
沒什麼大不了的
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

272
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,870
這當然沒什麼大不了
How's this for not making a big thing?

273
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,160
瑪拉
Hey, Marla!

274
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,640
瑪拉
Marla!

275
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,460
我們交換電話號碼吧
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

276
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,560
要嗎?
Should we?

277
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,480
- 或許有時會想換時間啊  - 好
- We might wanna switch nights. - OK.

278
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,940
我就是這樣認識瑪拉辛格的
This is how I met Marla Singer.

279
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,650
瑪拉的哲學是 她隨時都會死
Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.

280
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,530
悲慘的是 她一直都沒死
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.

281
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,120
你沒寫名字 你是誰?
It doesn't have your name! Who are you?

282
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,330
柯裡納斯? 陸波?
Cornelius? Rupert?

283
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,960
崔維斯? 到底是哪個蠢名字?
Travis? Any of the stupid names you give each night?

284
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,600
我在西雅圖機場上醒來 或三藩市機場 或洛城機場
You wake up at SeaTac. SFO. LAX.

285

287
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,410

288
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,050
太平洋 山區 或中央時區
Pacific. Mountain. Central.

289
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,380
有時多一小時 有時少一小時
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.

290
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,150
兩小時前就要辦登機手續 先生
The check-in for that flight isn't for another two hours, sir.

291
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,690
你的生命一分一分的消逝
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.

292
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,220
在哈柏國際機場醒來
You wake up at Air Harbor International.

293
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:46,080
若在不同時間於不同地點醒來
If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,

294
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,810
你會變成不同的人嗎?
could you wake up as a different person?

295
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,350
我不管到哪 都有瑣事
Everywhere I travel, tiny life.

296
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,940
一包糖 一包奶精
Single-serving sugar and cream.

297
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,170
一包奶油
Single pat of butter.

298
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,760
方型的微波爐餐
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.

299
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,610
旅行用洗髮精組
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

300
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,650
簡單的牙刷牙膏 小肥皂
Sample-package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.

301
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,620
我在每架飛機上遇到的人
The people I meet on each flight,

302
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,930
也都是一面之緣的朋友
they're single-serving friends.

303
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:19,040
在起飛和降落前 我們相互之間分享一點時間
Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together. That's all we get.

304
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,230
歡迎
Welcome!

305
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,300
總之時間一到 大家都翹辮子
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

306
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,210
我是一名汽車召回協調員 我的工作就是使用一些公式
I was a recall coordinator. My job was to apply the formula.

307
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,110
那個嬰兒就是從擋風玻璃這地方被甩出來的 這個三分
The infant went through the windshield.

308
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,790
這是我們公司的新車款 時速60英里
A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.

309
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,050
後輪差速排檔鎖死了
The rear differential locks up.

310
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,690
有個孩子的牙套留在後座的煙灰缸上
The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray.

311
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,920
這個畫面可以做戒煙廣告
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

312
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,850
車子撞擊時 人都還在車內
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.

313
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,970
需要回收這款車型嗎?
Now, should we initiate a recall?

314
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,400
這爸爸一定很胖
The father must have been huge.

315
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,480
你看座位上被燒的肥油痕跡
See where the fat burned to the seat? The polyester shirt?

316
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,580
很有現代藝術感
Very modern art.

317
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,330
將這輛車的序號 A
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.

318
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,040
乘以故障機率 B
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.

319
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,830
再乘以官司需要的費用 C
Multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, C.

320
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,100
A乘以B乘以C等於X
A x B x C equals X.

321
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,800
若X小於善後處理費用的話
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

322
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,900
我們就不做車型的回收
we don't do one.

323
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,320
這種意外很多嗎?
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

324
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,090
多到你無法相信
You wouldn't believe.

325
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,070
你是哪家汽車公司的?
Which car company do you work for?

326
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,410
很大的那家
A major one.

327
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,240
只要飛機搖晃的厲害時
Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,

328
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,420
我都祈禱能墜機或是爆炸 什麼都行
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision. Anything.

329
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,290
出差保險理賠是一般的三倍
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.

330
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,930
"如果您的座位是在緊急出口的旁邊"
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

331
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,920
"而且您覺得自己無法承擔 或不願承擔安全指引卡所列明的義務"
and would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties

332
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,430
"請要求機組人員為您安排另一個座位"
listed on the safety card, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

333
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,510
你的責任很重呢?
It's a lot of responsibility.

334
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,530
你想要換位子嗎?
Wanna switch seats?

335
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,210
我沒辦法勝任那種工作
No. I'm not sure I'm the man for that particularjob.

336
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,610
3萬英尺高的緊急出口
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

337
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,700
還有什麼安全可言
The illusion of safety.

338
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,630
就是說啊
Yeah. I guess so.

339
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,660
你知道機上為什麼有氧氣罩?
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?

340
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,550
讓我們呼吸啊
So you can breathe.

341
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,300
是因為氧氣讓人興奮
Oxygen gets you high.

342
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,800
緊急狀況時 人會大口呼吸
In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panic breaths.

343
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,870
吸了氧氣會有安定感
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

344
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,480
就會面對現實
You accept your fate.

345
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,770
上面都有寫
It's all right here.

346
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,200
緊急水上降落 時速6百英里
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

347
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,140
乘客每個都臉色慘白
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

348
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,180
你剛才說的...
That's...

349
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,120
那些理論很有趣
That's an interesting theory.

350
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,660
你是幹什麼的?
What do you do?

351
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,920
什麼意思?
What do you mean?

352
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,110
你是幹什麼工作的?
What do you do for a living?

353
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,290
幹嘛?
Why?

354
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,730
你會假裝你有興趣嗎?
So you can pretend you're interested?

355
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,500
你的笑聲裡帶著絕望
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

356
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,540
我們的公事包一模一樣
We have the exact same briefcase.

357
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,630
肥皂
Soap.

358
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,380
- 什麼?  - 我製造 銷售肥皂
- Sorry? - I make and I sell soap.

359
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,020
這些可是文明的產物
The yardstick of civilization.

360
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,120
我就是這樣認識了...
And this is how I met...

361
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,090
泰勒德頓
Tyler Durden.

362
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,090
等量的汽油和凍柳橙汁混合後
Did you know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice,

363
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,630
可以做成汽油彈喔 知道嗎?
you can make napalm?

364
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,430
不知道 這是真的嗎?
No, I did not. Is that true?

365
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,540
真的
That's right.

366
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,830
用家裡的小東西就能做炸彈
One can make all kinds of explosives with simple household items.

367
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,940
真的?
Really?

368
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,770
只要你想做
If one was so inclined.

369
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,200
你是我的一次性朋友裡頭最有趣的一個
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting single-serving friend I have ever met.

370
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,060
飛機上所有東西都是一次性的
Everything on a plane is single-serving...

371
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,420
我聽懂了 真聰明
Oh, I get it. Very clever.

372
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,020
謝謝
Thank you.

373
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,450
那樣對你有什麼好處?
How's it working out for you?

374
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,120
什麼?
What?

375
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,360
聰明啊
Being clever?

376
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,360
這很好啊
Great.

377
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,160
那就繼續保持吧
Keep it up, then. Right up.

378
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,215
一個關於禮儀的問題 當我出去時
A question of etiquette. As I pass,

379
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:23,860
我該面向著你 還是屁股向著你才有禮貌
do I give you the ass or the crotch?

380
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,380
我會跟泰勒住是有原因的
How I came to live with Tyler is...

381
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,480
因為航空公司討厭震動的行李
Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.

382
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,590
有滴答聲嗎?
Was it ticking?

383
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,500
丟手說現代炸彈是無聲的
Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

384
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,200
丟手?
Sorry, throwers?

385
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,270
處理行李的人
Baggage handlers.

386
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,300
只要行李會震動 就得報警
But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have got to call the police.

387
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,810
我的行李會震動?
My suitcase was vibrating?

388
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,070
這情況十之八九是電動刮胡刀
Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor.

389
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,680
可是有時候是...
But... every once in a while

390
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,280
人造男性生殖震動器
it's a dildo.

391
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,450
那東西沒有列入我們的禁品
It's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.

392
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,660
法條只說"人造男性生殖器" 而非"你的人造男性生殖器"
We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never your dildo.

393
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,430
我沒有...
I don't own...

394
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,970
我所有的東西都在裡面
I had everything in that suitcase.

395
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,600
我的凱文克萊襯衫
My CK shirts.

396
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,010
我的DKNY鞋子
My DKNYshoes.

397
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,080
我的AX領帶
My AX ties.

398
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,240
算了
Never mind.

399
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,080
嘿 那是我的車!
Hey! That's my car!

400
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,490
我的公寓是在15樓的小窩
Home was a condo on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows and professionals.

401
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,870
四面都是水泥牆
The walls were solid concrete.

402
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,470
重要的是水泥牆
A foot of concrete is important

403
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,810
可以抵擋鄰居的噪音
when your next-door neighbor has to watch game shows at full volume

404
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,710
也能防止火山爆發時弄壞傢俱
Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects

405
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,480
將傢俱甩出 燒得精光
blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.

406
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,380
這種事有可能發生的
I suppose these things happen.

407
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,970
上面什麼都沒有了
There's... nothing up there.

408
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,110
你不能進去 這是警方的命令
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

409
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,080
你有人可以聯絡嗎?
Do you have somebody you can call?

410
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,380
真丟臉
How embarrassing.

411
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,090
房裡只有調味料 沒有東西吃
A houseful of condiments and no food.

412
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,030
"瑪拉辛格"

413
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,900
警方說可能是爐火火苗熄了
The police later told me the pilot light might have gone out

414
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,540
所以瓦斯外泄
letting out just a little bit of gas.

415
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,370
瓦斯慢慢充滿房裡
That gas could have filled the condo.

416
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,470
好幾天來慢慢累積
1700 square feet with high ceilings for days and days.

417
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,860
後來碰到冰箱壓縮機啟動...
Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.

418
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,000
喂?
Yeah?

419
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,630
我聽到你的呼吸...
I can hear you breathing...

420
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,640
我也不知道為什麼打電話找他
If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.

421
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,900
- 喂?  - 你是哪位?
- Hello? - Who's this?

422
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,300
- 泰勒嗎?  - 你是誰?
- Tyler? - Who is this?

423
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,940
我們在飛機上見過
We met... We met on the airplane.

424
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,530
公事包一模一樣的
We had the same suitcase?

425
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,970
那個聰明人?
The clever guy?

426
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,240
對了
Oh, yeah. Right.

427
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,480
我剛才也打過
I called a second ago.

428
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,640
沒有人接電話 我是用的公用電話
There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.

429
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,550
我從不接電話 只回拔電話
Yeah, I never pick up my phone.

430
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,290
怎麼了?
So what's up?

431
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:09,560
說了你也不會相信
Well. You're not gonna believe this.

432
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,200
你知道嗎 這還算好的
You know, it could be worse.

433
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,840
萬一被女人割老二 再被她丟到別人車上才慘
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

434
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,700
那種事也可能發生
There's always that. I don't know.

435
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,510
只是每次買傢俱時都會想
When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it.

436
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,210
"這是我最後一次買沙發"
That's the last sofa I'll need.

437
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,150
"我要好好保護這套沙發"
Whatever happens, that sofa problem is handled.

438
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,950
我什麼都有 還有高級音響
I had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent.

439
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,400
漂亮的衣櫃
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

440
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,560
不用多久我就什麼都有了
I was close to being complete.

441
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,490
可是現在卻一無所有
Shit, man. Now it's all gone.

442
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,160
一無所有
All gone.

443
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,030
一無所有
All gone.

444
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,130
你聽過鴨絨墊子嗎?
Do you know what a duvet is?

445
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,400
- 棉被?  - 是毯子
- A comforter. - It's a blanket.

446
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,980
我們一定要知道鴨絨墊子嗎?
Just a blanket. Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?

447
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,710
我們一定要字字斟酌嗎?
Is this essential to our survival in the hunter-gatherer sense?

448
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,940
不用
No.

449
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,350
那你和我算什麼?
What are we, then?

450
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,650
消費者啊
I dunno. Consumers.

451
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,620
對 我們就是消費者
Right. We're consumers.

452
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,120
我們滿腦子想的都是物質
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

453
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,640
我不關心兇殺案和貧窮問題
Murder, crime, poverty. These things don't concern me.

454
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,400
我只關心名人雜誌
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

455
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,370
5百個頻道的電視
television with 500 channels,

456
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,130
我內褲上印著誰的名字
some guy's name on my underwear.

457
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,870
生髮劑 威爾鋼 減肥藥
Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.

458
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,970
還有萬能的瑪莎
Martha Stewart.

459
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,060
去她的瑪莎
Fuck Martha Stewart.

460
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,740
瑪莎所造就的世界慢慢沉淪
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic. It's all going down.

461
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,610
去你的沙發和綠條紋沙發布
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.

462
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,410
不要讓自己什麼都有
I say never be complete.

463
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,580
不要做完美的人
I say stop being perfect.

464
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,800
我們要進化 水來土掩
I say let's evolve. Let the chips fall where they may.

465
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,870
那只是我的意見 也許我錯了
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

466
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,060
也許你很重視那些東西
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

467
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,800
只是一堆身外物 無所謂
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

468
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,330
你的確損失不少現代傢俱
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.

469
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,670
沒錯 你說得對 哦不 我不抽煙
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

470
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,140
我的保險會賠償的
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

471
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,820
怎麼了?
What?

472
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,290
你已經被物質奴役了
The things you own end up owning you.

473
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,960
隨便你吧
Do what you like, man.

474
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,640
很晚了
Oh, it's late.

475
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,630
- 謝謝你請我喝酒  - 不客氣
- Hey, thanks for the beer. - Yeah, man.

476
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,870
我要找家飯店才行
I should find a hotel.

477
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,570
什麼?
What?

478
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,830
什麼?
What?

479
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,870
飯店?
A hotel?

480
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,870
是啊
Yeah.

481
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,670
開口問嘛
Just ask, man.

482
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,480
你說什麼?
What are you talking about?

483
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,330
噢 天 都喝三杯酒了 還不敢問
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask.

484
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,890
什麼?
What?

485
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,020
你找我是因為你沒地方住
You called me because you needed a place to stay.

486
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,690
我不是...
Oh, hey. No, no, no.

487
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,780
就是 開口說就是了
Yes, you did. So just ask.

488
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,590
別裝了 直接說吧
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

489
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,330
會給你帶來麻煩嗎?
Would... Would that be a problem?

490
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,130
你開口問會有什麼麻煩嗎?
Is it a problem for you to ask?

491
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,230
我可以到你家借住嗎?
Can I stay at your place?

492
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,530
可以
Yeah.

493
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,010
謝了
Thanks.

494
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,220
我要你幫我一個忙
I want you to do me a favor.

495
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,340
什麼忙?
Yeah, sure.

496
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,510
用力打我
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

497
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,490
什麼?
What?

498
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,280
我要你用盡全力打我
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

499
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,560
我先介紹泰勒德頓
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.

500
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,970
他是個夜貓子
Tyler was a night person.

501
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,990
我們睡覺的時候他卻在工作
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

502
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,160
他兼職做放映師
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

503
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,610
電影分好幾卷 並非一卷到底
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few.

504
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,520
需要有人準確的
Someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment

505
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,500
接上兩卷膠捲
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

506
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,530
你會在右上方看到小點點
You can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen.

507
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,560
我們的行話叫做香煙烙點
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

508
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,380
那就是換下一卷的記號
That's the cue for a changeover.

509
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,990
他在電影進行中換放映機
He flips the projectors,

510
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,920
觀眾毫不知情
movie keeps going and the audience has no idea.

511
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,460
怎麼會有人做這種爛工作?
Why would anyone want this shit job?

512
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,660
因為這樣他就能做怪
Because it affords him interesting opportunities.

513
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,900
把色情電影片段放入普級片中
Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films.

514
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,850
所以在看名人配音的卡通片時
So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

515
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:18,190
就會發現泰勒的傑作
that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film.

516
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,550
觀眾根本沒察覺到自己看到了
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

517
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,650
好大的屌
Nice, big cock.

518
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,590
泰勒的動作快極了
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.

519
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:48,250
他有時也在大飯店兼作侍者
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

520
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,950
他是食品服務業的恐怖份子
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.

521
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,780
別看我 我會尿不出來
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

522
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,190
他有時會在甜點上放屁
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,

523
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,950
在萵苣火鍋裡擤鼻涕
he farted on meringues,

524
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,470
至於蘑菇湯上面的奶油...
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

525
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,560
告訴他們啊
Go ahead, tell 'em.

526
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,930
你們猜到了吧
You get the idea.

527
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,760
你要我打你?
You just want me to hit you?

528
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,430
幫我一下嘛
Come on. Do me this one favor.

529
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,430
為什麼?
Why?

530
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,030
不知道 我沒打過架 你呢?
I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

531
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,640
沒有 沒打過架很好啊
No. But that's a good thing.

532
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,040
沒幹過架 怎會瞭解自己?
You can't know yourself if you haven't!

533
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,830
我希望死的時候身上滿是傷痕
I don't wanna die without any scars.

534
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,550
- 來吧 在我還有勇氣的時候打我  - 噢 你這神經病
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve. - Oh, God. This is crazy.

535
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,450
發神經啊 快打我
So go crazy! Let it rip.

536
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,840
- 我覺得不好吧  - 管他呢
- I don't know about this. - I don't either.

537
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,730
又沒有人看見 你在乎什麼?
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching. What do you care?

538
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,720
你這瘋子 真的要我打你?
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

539
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,190
沒錯
That's right.

540
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,130
打哪裡? 打臉嗎?
Where? Like, in the face?

541
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,460
隨便你
Surprise me.

542
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,930
這主意真他媽蠢....
This is so fucking stupid.

543
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:00,810
去你的
Motherfucker!

544
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,250
你居然打我耳朵
He hit me in the ear!

545
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,910
- 對不起  - 喔哇 該死!
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry. - Ow, Christ!

546
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,720
- 為什麼打我耳朵?  - 是我的錯
- Why the ear, man? - I fucked it up.

547
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,950
不 這樣很棒
No, that was perfect.

548
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,000
你沒事吧?
No, it's all right.

549
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,630
很痛啊
It really hurts.

550
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,610
沒錯
Right.

551
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,740
再打我一次
Hit me again.

552
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,580
換你打我了
No, you hit me.

553
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,380
打我啊
Come on!

554
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,460
我們應該再打一場
We should do this again sometime.

555
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,070
- 你的車呢?  - 什麼車?
- Where's your car? - What car?

556
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,850
不知道泰勒怎麼找到那地方
I don't know how Tyler found that house

557
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,300
他說他住在那裡一年了
but he said he'd been there for a year.

558
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,340
看起來好像快拆除的房子
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.

559
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,740
窗戶都被封死了
Most of the windows were boarded up.

560
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,700
門也無法上鎖
There was no lock on the front door from when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.

561
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,570
樓梯隨時都會垮
The stairs were ready to collapse.

562
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,340
這裡是他的 還是偷住的?
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.

563
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,480
我覺得都有可能
Neither would have surprised me.

564
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,290
那是你的 那是我的
Yep. That's you. That's me.

565
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,340
那是廁所 可以吧?
That's the toilet. Good?

566
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,210
很好 謝謝
Yeah, thanks.

567
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,760
什麼爛地方
What a shithole.

568
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,890
什麼都不能用
Nothing worked.

569
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,930
開這盞燈 另一盞燈就會滅
Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.

570
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,230
方圓百里只有倉庫和造紙廠
There were no neighbors. Just warehouses and a paper mill.

571
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,010
有蒸氣的惡臭
That fart smell of steam.

572
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,110
還有木頭的腐朽味道
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.

573
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,010
等一下
What have we here?

574
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,260
你們好
Hey, guys.

575
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,440
碰到下雨 我們還得切掉電源
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.

576
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,310
都月底了 我也不想看電視
By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.

577
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,820
更不在乎熱騰騰的冰箱
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.

578
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,600
我下一個好嗎?
Can I be next?

579
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,200
好啊
All right, man.

580
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,210
鬆開領帶
Lose the tie.

581
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,780
晚上我和泰勒住在偏僻的房裡
At night,Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.

582
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,260
屋頂不斷漏下雨滴
Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.

583
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,560
只要是木制的傢俱通通膨脹
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.

584
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,460
生蛌滌v子都跑了出來
Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.

585
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,670
之前的住家一定都不出門
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.

586
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,700
你在讀什麼?
Hey, man. What are you reading?

587
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,640
看看這個 以某個器官做第一人稱的文章
Listen to this. It's an article written by an organ in the first person.

588
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,440
"我是傑克的脊髓"
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata. Without me,

589
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,540
"沒有了我 他就沒有心跳"
Jack could not regulate his heart rate or breathing."

590
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,880
這裡還有很多 "我是吉兒的乳頭"
There's a whole series of these. "I Am Jill's Nipples."

591
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,880
- "我是傑克的結腸"  - 呵呵 "我得了癌症 會害死傑克"
- "I Am Jack's Colon." - "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

592
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,430
每次打架後 我的聽力就減弱
After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down.

593
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,970
什麼?
What?

594
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,200
什麼事情都迎刃而解
You could deal with anything.

595
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,170
報告寫完了嗎?
Have you finished those reports?

596
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,540
要是可以選擇 你最想跟誰打架?
If you could choose, who would you fight?

597
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,050
我老闆吧
I'd fight my boss, probably.

598
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,350
真的?
Really?

599
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,310
你呢? 你會和誰打架?
Yeah, why? Who would you fight?

600
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,250
我爸
I'd fight my dad.

601
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,520
我不認識我爸
I don't know my dad.

602
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,660
我認識他啦
I mean, I know him, but...

603
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,960
可是我六歲時 他就離開了
He left when I was like, six years old.

604
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,020
娶了另一個女人 生其他孩子
Married this other woman and had some other kids.

605
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,340
他每六年就換地方 重新成家
He did this every six years. He changes city and starts a new family.

606
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,970
他是在開分公司嗎?
Fucker's setting up franchises!

607
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,440
我爸沒讀大學
My dad never went to college.

608
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,380
- 所以我必須讀  - 這經歷聽起來很熟悉
- So it was real important that I go. - That sounds familiar.

609
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,550
我畢業後打電話給他
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance and say,

610
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,980
"爸 我現在要做什麼?"
"Dad, now what?"

611
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,950
他說"找工作啊"
He says, "Get ajob."

612
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,090
我也是
Same here.

613
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,750
我現在長大了 打電話給他
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

614
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,930
我問"爸 我現在要幹嘛?"
"Dad, now what?"

615
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,020
他說"不知道 結婚吧"
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

616
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,430
你不可能結婚的
You can't get married.

617
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,460
我是個30歲的小孩子
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

618
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,260
我們都是被女人養大的
We're a generation of men raised by women.

619
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,770
再找一個女人就可以了嗎?
I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.

620
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,010
大多數時候 我倆互相照顧
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.

621
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:42,410
可是每到週末夜晚 我們都要找事做
But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.

622
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,750
證明自己不是孤獨的
We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.

623
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,230
我以前要是帶著憤怒回家
It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed,

624
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,300
我會打掃公寓 替傢俱打蠟
I'd just clean my condo. Polish my Scandinavian furniture.

625
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,460
我早該另覓公寓
I should have been looking for a new condo

626
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,810
找保險公司辦理賠的
or haggling with my insurance company.

627
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,380
我應該要替我的失去感到難過
I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit.

628
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:06,970
可是我沒有
But I wasn't.

629
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,080
各公司的網路著重在於效率
The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient

630
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,020
在週一的早上 我只是期待下星期的來臨
Monday mornings, I just thought about next week.

631
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,690
用藍色做圖示好嗎?
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

632
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,220
好啊
Absolutely.

633
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,590
最重要的是效率
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

634
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,630
因為浪費就是盜竊行為
Because waste is a thief.

635
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,260
我給朋友看過了 你喜歡吧?
I showed this to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?

636
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,840
只要喝一品脫的血就會生病
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.

637
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
每個人臉上都有這種表情
It was right in everyone's face.

638
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,370
泰勒和我只是表現出來
Tyler and I just made it visible.

639
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,750
大家都這麼想
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

640
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,650
泰勒和我則直言不諱
Tyler and I just gave it a name.

641
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,500
各位 你們必須回家了
Come on, you've gotta go home!

642
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,890
關掉音樂 把後門鎖上
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

643
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,750
泰勒每週都重述我倆訂的規則
Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.

644
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,250
各位
Gentlemen!

645
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,150
歡迎來到搏擊俱樂部

00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,390
搏擊俱樂部第一條規則
The first rule of Fight Club is

647
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,820
就是不能提及搏擊俱樂部

648
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,460
搏擊俱樂部第二條規則
The second rule of Fight Club is

649
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,410
還是不能提及搏擊俱樂部
you do not talk about Fight Club!

650
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,000
第三條規則
Third rule of Fight Club.

651
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,680
只要有人喊停 四肢受傷 快累死了
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

652
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,640
打鬥就得停
the fight is over.

653
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,950
第四條規則 一次只能兩個人打
Fourth rule. Only two guys to a fight.

654
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,270
第五條...
Fifth rule.

655
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,650
一次一場

656
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,230
第六條 脫掉襯衫和鞋子打

657
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,220
第七條
Seventh rule.

658
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,080
打鬥沒有時限
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

659
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,890
第八條 也是最後一條
And the eighth and final rule.

660
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,860
如果你是初次參加
If this is your first night at Fight Club

661
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,170
就一定得打
you have to fight.

662
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,390
辦公室的小弟李奇
This kid from work, Ricky,

663
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:50,880
上班時什麼事都記不住
couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black.

664
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,830
但他打架的招式可是一流的
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced the maitre d' of a local food court.

665
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:04,770
在?喊聲中 只聽得見打擊聲
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling.

666
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,830
或是滿嘴是血的咳嗽聲
Or the wet choke when someone gasped and sprayed...

667
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,440
停
Stop!

668
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,910
在那裡 你才真正的活了起來
You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.

669
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:20,820
搏擊俱樂部只在聚會時存在
But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.

670
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,090
就算是我認為打得很棒的人
Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,

671
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,760
聚會結束後 也會馬上改變
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.

672
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,160
在俱樂部的你不是其他地方的你
Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were outside of it.

673
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,670
剛來俱樂部的人
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.

674
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,170
屁股都是光滑圓潤
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.

675
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,240
幾周後 就像雕刻過的木頭
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.

676
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,650
假如可以選擇 你最想跟哪個名人打?
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?

677
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,470
- 活的還是死的?  - 都可以 誰最難打?
- Alive or dead? - Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

678
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,380
海明威
Hemingway.

679
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,550
你呢?
You?

680
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,990
沙特納
Shatner.

681
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,620
我要跟威廉沙特納打
I'd fight William Shatner.

682
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,590
我們開始有不同觀點
We all started seeing things differently.

683
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,120
不管到哪 我們都會評論
Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.

684
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,430
我覺得上健身房的人真可悲
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,

685
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,040
以凱文克萊的標準為目標
trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.

686
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,070
那是男人應該有的樣子嗎?
Is that what a man looks like?

687
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,280
自我成長要靠手淫
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

688
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,840
自我毀滅...
Now, self-destruction...

689
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,070
對不起
Excuse me.

690
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,720
搏擊俱樂部不在乎輸贏
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.

691
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:03,050
也不需要言語
It wasn't about words.

692
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,130
真正的?喊聲含在嘴裡
The hysterical shouting was in tongues

693
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,530
跟聖靈降臨教派類似
like at a Pentecostal Church.

694
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,300
- 怎麼樣?  - 停...
- Is that it? - Stop!

695
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,940
打架結束後 不需要處理問題
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.

696
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,570
因為一切都沒關係
But nothing mattered.

697
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,710
真棒
Cool.

698
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,520
打過之後 猶如被救贖一般
Afterwards, we all felt saved.

699
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,950
嘿 夥計 下禮拜怎樣?
Hey, man. How about next week?

700
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,250
下個月呢?
How about next month?!

701
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,420
說話小心點 艾文到中間來
Irvine, you're in the middle.

702
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,550
新來的也過來
New guy, you too.

703
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,230
有時候泰勒會替我說話
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

704
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,360
他從樓梯上摔了下來
He fell down some stairs.

705
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,060
我從樓梯上摔了下來
I fell down some stairs.

706
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,900
因為俱樂部 我剪髮剪指甲
Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.

707
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,270
歷史上的人物呢?
OK. Any historical figure.

708
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,610
我會跟甘地打
I'd fight Gandhi.

709
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,920
好答案
Good answer.

710
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,510
你呢?
How about you?

711
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,650
林肯
Lincoln.

712
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,750
林肯?
Lincoln?

713
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,860
他很高大 會打到快死才肯停
Big guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

714
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,050
操
Fuck!

715
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,330
年紀大了 不中用了
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

716
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,210
喂?
Hello?

717
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,450
你這兩個月到哪去了?
Where have you been the last eight weeks?

718
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,840
瑪拉?
Marla?

719
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,950
你怎麼找到我的?
How did you find me?

720
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,420
你在答錄機上留的
You left a forwarding number.

721
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,190
我都沒在團體課上看見你
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

722
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,060
因為我們分開上了啊
We split 'em up. That was the idea. Remember?

723
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,260
可是你也沒去上你的課啊
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

724
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,770
你怎麼知道?
How do you know?

725
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:47,790
我作弊了
I cheated.

726
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,260
我找到一個新的
I found a new one.

727
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,140
真的?
Really?

728
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:52,900
只有男人可以參加
It's for men only.

729
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,560
跟睾丸癌一樣嗎?
Like the testicle thing?

730
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,080
我現在不能跟你談
Look, this is a bad time.

731
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,980
我參加了花錢狂治療團體
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

732
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,250
- 那裡到處都是毫無希望的人...  - 我剛好要出門
- They're really fucked-up people... - I'm on my way out.

733
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,080
我也是 我吃了好多安眠藥
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

734
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,090
把瓶子裡的通通吃光了
I took what was left of a bottle.

735
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,620
可能吃太多了吧
It might have been too much.

736
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,960
我想像著瑪拉在家裡蹣跚的樣子
Picture Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.

737
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,630
我並不想自殺 只是想求助 (她可能要搞好幾個小時)
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

738
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,570
你今晚會在家囉?
So you're staying in tonight, then?

739
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,900
要不要聽我描述死亡?
Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?

740
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:33,110
等著看我有多少精神講電話
Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?

741
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,440
聽過死前的喘息嗎?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

742
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,750
泰勒的門關著
Tyler's door was closed.

743
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,440
這兩個月來 他的門從沒關過
I'd been here for two months and his door was never closed.

744
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,160
我做了一個很誇張的夢
You won't believe this dream I had last night.

745
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,020
我也不敢相信昨晚的事
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

746
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,100
你怎麼會在這裡?
What are you doing here?

747
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,170
什麼?
What?

748
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,480
這是我家 你怎麼會在我家?
This is my house. What are you doing here?

749
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,850
去你的
Fuck you!

750
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,170
你朋友真的被搞死了
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

751
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,700
可是她很有彈性
Limber, though.

752
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,240
愚蠢的性玩具
Silly cooze.

753
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,470
昨天晚上我回來 看到電話沒掛
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

754
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,210
想聽聽看是誰?
Guess who's on the other end?

755
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,480
不用他說 我就知道經過了
I knew the story before he told me.

756
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,390
聽過死前的喘息嗎?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

757
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,580
你覺得這名字響亮嗎?
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

758
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,520
說不定我只會發出乾咳聲
Or will it just be a death hairball?

759
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,490
或者是將靈魂帶到...
Prepare to evacuate soul.

760
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,890
10...
Ten,

761
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,660
9...
nine...

762
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,930
8...
eight...

763
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:45,290
泰勒和其他的人 為什麼不希望瑪拉死?
How could Tyler, of all people, think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?

764
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,050
5...
Five,

765
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,940
4...
four...

766
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,180
3...等一下
three...Hang on.

767
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,150
你跑來得真快
You got here fast.

768
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,060
我有打電話給你嗎?
Did I call you?

769
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,330
床罩太滑了
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

770
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,390
別擔心 那東西不會傷害你
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

771
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,260
糟糕 有人報警了
Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.

772
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,760
513房在哪裡?
Hey, where's 513?

773
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,200
最後一間
End of the hall.

774
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,900
裡面那個女孩本來很好的
The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl.

775
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,510
可是她失去了自信
She has lost faith in herself.

776
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,340
辛格小姐 我們是來幫你的
Miss Singer, let us help you!

777
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,410
她是個怪物
She's a monster!

778
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,650
你不可以死
You have every reason to live.

779
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,880
她是個骯髒的人渣
She's infectious human waste!

780
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,780
祝你們救得到她
Good luck trying to save her!

781
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:11,970
要是我睡著就死定了
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

782
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,800
所以你必須保持我清醒
You're gonna have to keep me up

783
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,860
一整晚喔
all night.

784
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,600
太不可思議了
Un-fucking-believable.

785
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,700
他很輕易地解決了瑪拉的問題
He was obviously able to handle it.

786
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,300
你也知道的 因為你跟她幹過
You know what I mean, you fucked her.

787
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,800
我沒有
No, I didn't.

788
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:27,870
沒有?
Never?

789
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,180
對
No.

790
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,820
你不喜歡她嗎?
You're not into her, are you?

791
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,500
才沒有呢
No! God, not at all.

792
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,830
我真是氣瘋了
I am Jack's raging bile duct.

793
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,870
真的? 告訴我沒關係
Are you sure? You can tell me.

794
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,090
相信我 是真的
Believe me, I'm sure.

795
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,240
乾脆讓我自殺算了
Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.

796
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,080
那好 因為她其實兇悍的很 離她遠一點
She's a predator posing as a house pet. Stay away.

797
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,680
那女的說話很粗俗 我從來都沒聽過
The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

798
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,890
天 我很久沒幹的這麼爽了
My God.I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.

799
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,410
泰勒當然會喜歡那種人
How could Tyler not go for that?

800
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:03,920
有一次 他把色情片剪入灰姑娘裡
The other night, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.

801
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,720
瑪拉只是需要一個撫慰的人
Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker.

802
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,990
我們只是互相發洩
Or a wash. This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

803
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,790
她先是闖入我的安慰團體
She invaded my support groups

804
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:12,920
現在又闖入我家
and now my home.

805
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,800
嘿 坐下
Hey, hey. Sit down.

806
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,360
聽著 你不能跟她談我的事
Now, listen. I can't have you talking to her about me.

807
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,130
我幹嘛...
Why would I...

808
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,200
你敢跟她說我或這間房子的事
Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,...

809
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,740
我們就絕交
we're done.

810
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,300
- 發誓  - 好啦
- Now promise me. - OK.

811
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,240
發誓啊
You promise?

812
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,040
我發誓
Yeah, I promise.

813
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,040
發誓啊
Promise?

814
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,140
我已經發誓了啊
I just said, I promise! What...

815
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,130
你要發誓三次
That's three times you promised.

816
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,310
若我當時花幾分鐘等瑪拉死
If only I had wasted a few minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,

817
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,860
就不會這樣子了
none of this would have happened.

818
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,650
用力 對 用力
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

819
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,910
其實我可以搬到...
I could have moved to another room.

820
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:07,700
三樓 就聽不到他們的聲音
On the third floor where I might not have heard them.

821
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,240
可是我沒搬
But I didn't.

822
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,060
你在幹嘛?
What are you doing?

823
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,740
準備上床睡覺啊
Just going to bed.

824
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,360
你要接替我嗎?
Wanna finish her off?

825
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,420
不用 謝謝
No. No, thank you.

826
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:45,950
我找到香煙了
I've found a cigarette.

827
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,350
- 你跟誰說話?  - 閉嘴
- Who were you talking to? - Shut up.

828
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,160
我成了世界最靜的一角
I became the calm little center of the world.

829
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,790
我是忍者大師
I was the Zen master.

830
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,170
我開始寫短徘句詩
I wrote little haiku poems.

831
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,420
將詩用電子郵件傳給他人
I e-mailed them to everyone.

832
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,620
那是你的血?
Is that your blood?

833
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:11,900
有些是
Some of it, yeah.

834
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:13,810
這裡不能抽煙
You can't smoke in here.

835
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,930
休一天假 回家換件乾淨衣服
Take the rest of the day off. Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

836
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,420
重新振作一下
Get yourself together.

837
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:24,790
每個人的臉上都帶著敵意
I got right in everyone's hostile face.

838
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,320
對 這些是打架後的瘀青
"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."

839
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,390
沒錯 我很喜歡這個樣子
"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."

840
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,430
我受到了啟發
"I am enlightened."

841
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,060
放棄公寓生活和物質生活
You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions,

842
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,820
住在一個偏僻的爛房子裡
move to a dilapidated house in a toxic waste area,

843
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,040
回家還要面對這個
and you have to come home to this.

844
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,020
- 你好  - 我是縱火組的史丹警探
- Hello. - This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.

845
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:04,030
你公寓的事 我們有了新線索
We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.

846
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:10,560
我不確定你是否知道 有人在你門鎖上灑冷媒
I don't know if you're aware, but someone sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

847
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:14,030
然後用鑿子打鎖引起火花的?
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.

848
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,800
我不知道
No, I wasn't aware of that.

849
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,540
我馬上打冷顫
I am Jack's cold sweat.

850
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,140
你覺得奇怪嗎?
Does this sound strange to you?

851
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,770
是 非常奇怪
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.

852
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,070
- 炸藥...  - 炸藥
- The dynamite - Dynamite?

853
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,590
現場有殘留的銨酸鉀氯化鹽
left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

854
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,210
知道那是什麼意思嗎?
Do you know what this means?

855
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,450
不知道
No, what does it mean?

856
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,320
表示那是自製的
It means it was home-made.

857
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,060
抱歉 我也覺得很驚訝
I'm sorry. This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir.

858
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,660
就是這樣 瓦斯火苗才熄的
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown out your pilot light days before the explosion.

859
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,930
- 瓦斯是真正爆炸的原因  - 是誰做的?
- The gas was just a detonator. - Who would go and do that?

860
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,500
- 我才要問你這個呢  - 告訴他啊
- I'll ask the questions. - Tell him.

861
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:53,230
告訴他說是那些自由派份子搞得鬼
Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perceptions.

862
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,410
你在聽嗎?
Excuse me. Are you there?

863
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:59,080
有啊 我只是不知道該怎麼想
I am listening. It's hard to know what to make of this.

864
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:03,220
你有什麼敵人嗎?
Have you recently made enemies who might have access to home-made dynamite?

865
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,220
敵人?
Enemies?

866
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,780
我要忘了物質生活的重要
Reject civilization, especially material possessions.

867
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,390
這件事很重要
Son, this is serious.

868
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,150
我知道
Yes, I know it's serious.

869
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,920
我說真的
I mean that.

870
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,430
我知道這件事很重要
Yes, it's very serious.

871
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,630
這件事對我比任何人都重要
Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me.

872
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,600
那間公寓等於我的生命
That condo was my life. OK?

873
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,060
裡面每樣傢俱都是我的最愛
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

874
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,170
被毀的不只是冷冰冰的東西
That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.

875
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,470
被毀的是我
It was me!

876
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,980
我真要好好感謝大學教育
I'd like to thank the Academy.

877
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,810
你現在不方便討論這件事嗎?
Is this not a good time for you?

878
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,210
告訴他是你做的嘛
Just tell him you fucking did it!

879
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,920
他希望你說是你弄的
Tell him you blew it all up! That's what he wants to hear.

880
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:41,890
- 你還在聽嗎?  - 等等 你認為我是嫌犯?
- Are you still there? - Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

881
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:44,320
不是 我們只是需要再談談
No. I may need to talk to you,

882
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,160
若你要出遠門 記得告訴我
so you let me know if you're gonna leave town.

883
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,860
- 可以嗎?  - 好
- OK? - OK.

884
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,760
泰勒和瑪拉從不同時出現
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

885
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,830
我爸媽也曾這樣好多年
My parents pulled this exact same act for years.

886
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,770
保險套是我們這代的玻璃鞋
The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.

887
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,780
遇到陌生人時就得戴上一個
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

888
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:10,110
跳整晚舞之後 就把這東西丟掉
You... dance all night. Then you throw it away.

889
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:12,980
丟保險套 不是丟陌生人
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

890
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,650
什麼?
What?

891
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,390
我花一塊錢買下了這件禮服
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

892
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,900
一分錢一分貨
It was worth every penny.

893
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,570
這件是結婚禮服
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

894
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:34,030
這件衣服只會被珍惜一天
Someone loved it intensely for one day.

895
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,950
然後就被扔了
Then tossed it.

896
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,680
就好像聖誕樹
Like a Christmas tree.

897
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,850
本來很特別的
So special.

898
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,620
可是...
Then

899
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,210
轟一聲
bam!

900
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,050
就被丟棄路旁
It's on the side of the road.

901
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,790
連裝飾品都還沒拆呢
Tinsel still clinging to it.

902
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,460
就像被奸殺後的死人一樣
Like a sex crime victim.

903
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,640
內褲穿反了
Underwear inside out.

904
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,570
- 還被黑黑的膠帶纏起來  - 這件衣服的確很適合你
- Bound with electrical tape. - Well then, it suits you.

905
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:05,770
你喜歡我可以借你
You can borrow it sometime.

906
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,380
趕她走
Get rid of her.

907
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,950
什麼? 你來趕她啊
What? You get rid of her!

908
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,310
別提到我
Don't mention me.

909
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:21,350
我又回到了六歲 替父母傳話
I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.

910
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,960
- 你該走了吧  - 別擔心 我正要走
- I really think it's time you left. - Don't worry, I'm leaving.

911
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,130
我們不喜歡你來
Not that we don't love your visits.

912
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,230
神經病 我真的受不了你了
You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

913
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,030
我得走囉...
Gotta get off

914
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,900
謝謝 再見
Thanks. Bye.

915
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,690
你們喔...
You kids!

916
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,990
為什麼要浪費時間在她身上?
Why do you still waste time with her?

917
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:03,960
因為瑪拉至少想壞得徹底
I'll say this about Marla. At least she's trying to hit bottom.

918
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,000
我沒有嗎?
And I'm not?

919
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,510
插上羽毛 不等於你就是老鷹
Feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken.

920
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,330
今晚要幹嘛?
What are we doing tonight?

921
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,070
今晚...
Tonight...

922
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,970
要做肥皂
we make soap.

923
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,980
真的?
Really?

924
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,310
要先提煉脂肪才能做肥皂
To make soap, first we render fat.

925
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,300
鹽份的量要很正確
The salt balance has to be just right

926
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,670
所以最好的脂肪是人體脂肪
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

927
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:43,700
等等 這是哪裡?
Wait, what is this place?

928
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,570
抽脂診所
A liposuction clinic.

929
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,980
找到了
Pay dirt!

930
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:01,920
全世界最有養分 最油的脂肪 無與倫比的
Richest, creamiest fat in the world. Fat of the land!

931
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,760
不要拉 不要拉
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

932
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,440
再給我一包
Give me another one.

933
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,620
提煉脂肪時 動物脂肪就會浮出來
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface.

934
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,040
跟童子軍時學的一樣
Like in Boy Scouts.

935
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,590
- 我能想像出你童子軍時的模樣  - 繼續攪拌
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout. - Keep stirring.

936
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,490
獸脂變硬後 除去表面的甘油
Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin.

937
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,190
加上硝酸後 就變成硝化甘油
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

938
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,490
再加上硝酸鈉和鋸屑
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,

939
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,300
就可以做成炸藥
you've got dynamite.

940
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,840
做肥皂 就能做很多炸藥
Yeah, with enough soap, one could blow up just about anything.

941
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,050
泰勒很有小聰明
Tyler was full of useful information.

942
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:54,120
古人知道小溪哪段最能洗衣服
People found clothes got cleaner when washed at a certain point in the river.

943
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,770
- 知道為什麼?  - 不知道
- You know why? - No.

944
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,790
只要找供奉生人的那段就對了
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river.

945
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,050
因為屍體燃燒時
Bodies burnt.

946
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,950
水沖刷灰燼會產生堿液
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

947
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,430
這就是堿液
This is lye.

948
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,990
混合了屍體被燒熔的脂肪
The crucial ingredient. Once it mixed with the melted body fat,

949
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,030
就能排出肥皂成份進入小溪
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

950
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,660
給我看看你的手好嗎?
May I see your hand, please?

951
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,340
你在幹嘛?
What is this?

952
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,940
這叫做化學灼傷
This is a chemical burn.

953
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,520
比其他灼傷都要痛 而且會留下疤痕
It will hurt more than any burn and it will leave a scar.

954
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,440
(你要幹嘛?) 這東西比癌症還要痛
Meditation worked for cancer, it could work now.

955
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,610
- 感受一下這種疼痛  - 噢 老天
- Don't shut the pain out. - Oh, God!

956
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,830
最早的肥皂都是英雄的灰燼
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,

957
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,380
跟首只上太空的猴子一樣偉大
like the first monkey shot into space.

958
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,520
沒有痛苦和犧牲 就沒有收穫
Without pain or sacrifice, we would have nothing.

959
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,630
我試著不去想"灼傷"這個詞
I tried not to think of the word searing of flesh.

960
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,410
停下 這就是你的痛
Stop it! This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

961
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,870
我要到洞裡找我的精神動物
I'm going to my cave to find my power animal.

962
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,270
不要用快死的人的方式躲避疼痛
No! Don't deal with this the way those dead people do! Come on!

963
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,500
我懂你要傳達的事了
I get the point!

964
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,140
不 那還不夠成熟
No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

965
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:09,990
不要錯過一生最棒的時刻
It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're off somewhere else!

966
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,860
我沒有
I am not!

967
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:14,190
閉嘴 我們的父親就像上帝的分身
Shut up! Our fathers were our models for God.

968
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,350
連父親都拋棄我們
If our fathers bailed,

969
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,260
更何況上帝
what does that tell you about God?

970
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,500
聽我說
Listen to me.

971
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,870
你要假設上帝不愛你
You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you.

972
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,460
他一直都不想要你
He never wanted you.

973
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,660
或許還很討厭你呢
In all probability, He hates you.

974
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,270
你的痛不是最悲慘的事 不是嗎?
This is not the worst thing that can happen.

975
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,400
我們不需要他
We don't need Him!

976
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,770
不需要
I agree!

977
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,420
去他的詛咒和贖罪
Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

978
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,950
我們都是被上帝遺棄的子民
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

979
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,810
我要拿水
I'm getting water!

980
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,480
用水澆會更糟糕的
You can use water and make it worse or...

981
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:42,180
看著我
Look at me.

982
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,090
用醋來中和吧
Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.

983
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,120
放開我
Please let me up!

984
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,150
你得先放棄一切
First, you have to give up.

985
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:51,490
你必須沒有恐懼
First, you have to know, not fear,

986
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,560
面對你總有天會死的事實
know that some day, you're gonna die.

987
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,700
你不知道這有多痛
You don't know how this feels!

988
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,800
只有拋棄一切 才能獲得自由
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.

989
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,310
好
OK.

990
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,170
恭喜你
Congratulations.

991
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,180
你越來越接近極限了
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

992
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,830
泰勒將肥皂以每條20元
Tyler sold his soap to department stores

993
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,800
賣給百貨公司
at $20 a bar.

994
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,340
不知道他們賣多少錢
God knows what they charged.

995
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:38,010
大家都說這種肥皂最好用
This is the best soap.

996
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:38,910
謝謝你 蘇珊
Thank you, Susan.

997
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,820
漂亮
It was beautiful.

998
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,110
把那些女人的脂肪賣回給她們
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.

999
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,180
他今天打黃色領帶
He was wearing his yellow tie.

1000
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,340
我現在根本不打領帶了
I didn't wear a tie to work any more.

1001
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,040
"搏擊俱樂部的第一條規則就是不能提及搏擊俱樂部"
"The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club."

1002
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,290
我又昏頭了
I'm half-asleep again.

1003
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:57,710
一定是把那張紙忘在影印機上
I must have left it in the copy machine.

1004
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:00,180
"搏擊俱樂部的第二條規則是..."這是你的?
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

1005
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:05,610
假設你是我 請你替我做個決定
Pretend you're me. Make a managerial decision.

1006
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:09,500
如果是你找到這個你會怎麼辦?
You find this. What would you do?

1007
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,310
我來告訴你吧
Well, I gotta tell you,

1008
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,410
我跟那個人說話會很小心
I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that.

1009
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,810
因為寫那些字的人一定很危險
Because the person who wrote that is dangerous.

1010
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:26,690
這個人面怪獸恐怕會大發雷霆
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap

1011
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,560
大鬧這裡每一間辦公室
and then stalk from office to office

1012
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,650
他會端著半自動的卡賓槍...
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,

1013
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:39,140
逐個殺光他所有的同事
pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers.

1014
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:43,190
這個可怕的人可能是你的老友
This might be someone you've known for years.

1015
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,870
跟你非常親近的人
Someone very, very close to you.

1016
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:49,860
那些都是泰勒會說的話
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.

1017
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,680
以前的我是個好好先生
And I used to be such a nice guy.

1018
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,080
不要每次撿到東西就找我
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up.

1019
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,660
服務部門 你好
Compliance and Liability.

1020
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,820
我的乳頭快爛掉了
My tit's gonna rot off.

1021
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:09,530
失陪了 我得接個電話
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

1022
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:18,100
- 你說什麼?  - 替我檢查是否長乳癌了好嗎?
- What do you mean? - I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

1023
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,330
- 去醫院啊  - 我沒錢去
- Go to a hospital. - I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

1024
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:24,490
我又不懂這個
I don't know about this, Marla.

1025
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,870
拜託
Please.

1026
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,410
她沒有找泰勒 因為我對她不會起邪念
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.

1027
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,020
不錯嘛 拿食物給...
That's nice. Taking food to

1028
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,680
哈尼佛 雷恩小姐 她們呢?
Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines. Where are they, exactly?

1029
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,370
都死了 我雖然活著 卻很窮
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty.

1030
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:42,950
要吃的嗎?
Want any?

1031
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,360
- 不用  - 我替你留了一份
- No, no. - I got one for you.

1032
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,630
謝謝你的好意
Thanks for the thought.

1033
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,100
你的手怎麼了?
What happened to your hand?

1034
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:53,120
沒什麼
Oh, nothing.

1035
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,740
這裡嗎?
Right there?

1036
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,450
- 有沒有感覺?  - 沒有
- Feel anything? - No.

1037
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:00,420
再確定一下
Well, make sure.

1038
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,340
我很確定
OK, I'm pretty sure.

1039
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,440
你一點感覺都沒有?
You feel nothing?

1040
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,740
沒有
No, nothing.

1041
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:12,030
那就好 謝謝
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

1042
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:16,920
- 呃 這沒啥的  - 我希望我有機會報答你
- No problem. - I wish I could return the favor.

1043
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,500
我們家族沒有人得過乳癌
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

1044
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,650
- 我可以替你檢查前列腺  - 我想我那裡沒什麼問題
- I could check your prostate. - I think I'm OK.

1045
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,860
謝謝你了
Well, thanks, anyway.

1046
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,300
好了嗎?
Are we done?

1047
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,470
好了 再見
Yeah, we're done. See you... around.

1048
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,030
柯納裡斯?
Cornelius?

1049
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:54,900
柯納裡斯?
Cornelius!

1050
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,050
是我啊 鮑伯
It's me! Bob!

1051
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,240
鮑伯
Hey, Bob.

1052
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,160
- 我們還以為你死了呢?  - 我還活著
- We all thought you were dead. - No, no. Still here.

1053
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:11,380
- 你好嗎?  - 比我之前的任何時候都要好
- How are you, Bob? - Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

1054
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,660
真的? 還參加團體課嗎?
Really? Still remaining men together?

1055
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,820
不 我找到了更好的寄託
No, no. I got something so much better now.

1056
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,560
真的? 是什麼?
Really, what is it?

1057
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,320
第一條規則是
Well...

1058
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,580
我不可以談論那件事
The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it.

1059
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:28,260
第二條規則是
And the second rule is

1060
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,470
我不可以談論那件事
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

1061
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,040
第三條規則是
And the third rule is...

1062
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,910
鮑伯 我也是會員
Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

1063
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,890
你看我的臉
Look at my face, Bob.

1064
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,700
那他媽... 那他媽太好了
That's fucking... fucking great.

1065
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,430
- 我沒見過你啊  - 我只有星期二和星期四去
- I've never seen you there. - I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

1066
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:48,820
- 我星期六去  - 恭喜你
- I go Saturday. - Congratulations.

1067
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,010
恭喜我們兩個吧
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

1068
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,920
你知道發起人是誰嗎?
Have you heard about the guy that invented it?

1069
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,620
噢 事實上...
Yeah, actually...

1070
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,030
我聽了好多傳說
I hear all kinds of things.

1071
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,470
有人說他是在精神病院出生的
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution

1072
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,030
他一個晚上只睡一小時
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1073
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,300
他很偉大耶
He's a great man.

1074
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,030
你認識泰勒德頓嗎?
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1075
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:37,090
我沒打疼你吧?
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1076
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,870
當然有
Actually, you did.

1077
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:44,070
謝謝你 謝謝
Thank you for this. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1078
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:44,910
搏擊俱樂部
Fight Club.

1079
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,400
是我和泰勒共同的創作
This was mine and Tyler's gift.

1080
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,210
是我們給世界的禮物
Our gift to the world.

1081
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,120
我發現有很多新面孔
I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces.

1082
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,890
閉嘴
Shut up!

1083
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:02,790
表示你們沒遵守前兩條規則
Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1084
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:15,540
我在這看到了最強最聰明的人
I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived.

1085
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,530
你們都很有潛力 但都被浪費了
I see all this potential. And I see it squandered.

1086
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:24,210
你們只是做一些替人加油
Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas.

1087
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,650
或是上菜
Waiting tables.

1088
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,230
或是打領帶上班的工作
Slaves with white collars.

1089
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:34,460
廣告誘惑我們買車子 衣服
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1090
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,430
於是拼命工作買不需要的東西
Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.

1091
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:44,170
我們是被歷史遺忘的一代
We're the middle children of history.

1092
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:45,860
沒有目的 沒有地位
No purpose or place.

1093
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,210
沒有世界大戰
We have no Great War.

1094
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:50,210
沒有經濟大恐慌
No Great Depression.

1095
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,380
我們的大戰只是心靈之戰
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1096
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:58,080
我們的恐慌只是我們的生活
Our great depression is our lives.

1097
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:04,590
我們從小看電視 相信有一天
We've all been raised on television to believe

1098
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,990
會成為富翁 明星或搖滾巨星
that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.

1099
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,160
但是...我們不會
But we won't.

1100
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,630
那是我們逐漸面對著的現實
We're slowly learning that fact.

1101
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,300
所以我們非常憤怒
And we're very, very pissed off.

1102
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:25,410
搏擊俱樂部第一條規則 不可以提及...
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1103
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:32,350
你是誰?
Who are you?

1104
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:35,620
- 我是誰?  - 對
- Who am I? - Yeah.

1105
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:39,490
這家酒吧叫做盧的酒吧
There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern.

1106
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,490
我就是盧 你又是誰?
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1107
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:46,900
泰勒德頓
Tyler Durden.

1108
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,210
你們怎麼可以用我的地方活動
Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place?

1109
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:53,370
我們跟艾文講好了
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1110
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:57,300
艾文現在正在家裡療傷呢
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1111
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,550
這又不是他的店
He don't own this place.

1112
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,020
這是我的
I do.

1113
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:05,210
- 你們給他多少錢?  - 一毛都沒有
- How much money's he getting for this? - There is no money.

1114
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,200
真的?
Realy?

1115
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,490
- 通通免費  - 很不可思議吧
- Free to all. - Ain't that something?

1116
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,790
沒錯
It is, actually.

1117
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,330
給我聽好
Look, stupid fuck!

1118
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,300
我要你們通通滾出去
I want everybody out of here right now.

1119
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,490
你也該加入我們的俱樂部
You should join our club.

1120
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,930
聽到我說什麼了嗎?
Did you hear what I just said?

1121
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:22,470
你跟你的朋友都可以加入
You and your friend.

1122
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,580
這下你明白我在說什麼了嗎?
You hear me now?

1123
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,080
我沒聽明白
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1124
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:38,610
還是沒聽明白
Still not getting it.

1125
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,520
好了 好了 好了 我知道了 我知道了
OK, OK, I got it.

1126
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,600
操 我又忘了
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1127
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,820
退後 都退後
Back! All of you!

1128
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,920
通通退後
Everybody back!

1129
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,570
盧
Ah, Lou!

1130
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:04,340
別這樣嘛 我們很喜歡這裡
Come on, man! We really like this place.

1131
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:17,920
- 繼續發洩吧  - 給我閉嘴
- That's right, Lou. Get it out. - Shut the fuck up.

1132
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,290
你覺得這樣很好笑?
Is that fucking funny?

1133
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,680
這傢伙瘋了
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1134
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,970
怎麼會這樣?
Unbelievable.

1135
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,190
- 我受過更大的痛苦呢 盧! - 天哪 天哪
- You don't know where I've been, Lou. - Oh, my God!

1136
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:52,160
我受過更大的痛苦呢
You don't know where I've been!

1137
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:56,300
讓我們繼續用這裡吧 求求你
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1138
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,660
要用就用吧
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1139
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:01,800
你得向我保證 向我保證
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1140
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:05,240
我用我媽的名譽保證
On my mother's eyes.

1141
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,350
謝謝你了 盧
Thanks, Lou.

1142
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,020
你也是 大個兒
You too, big guy.

1143
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,720
下周見了
We'll see you next week.

1144
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,910
本周 每個人都有指定作業
This week, each one of you has a homework assignment.

1145
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:48,620
你們必須找一個完全不認識的人打架
You're gonna go out. You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger.

1146
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:54,130
你必須引起一場打鬥
You're gonna start a fight

1147
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,220
可是你必須打輸
and you're gonna lose.

1148
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,360
眼光不錯喔 先生
Excellent choice, sir.

1149
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:06,000
小心點 你這混蛋!
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1150
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,400
這份作業並不簡單
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.

1151
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,710
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

1152
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:18,550
正常人都會儘量避免打架
Most people, normal people,do just about anything to avoid a fight.

1153
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,660
抱歉
Excuse me!

1154
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,850
你剛才噴到我了 你根本沒必要這麼幹
You sprayed me with your hose. That's not necessary...

1155
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,910
傑 快打電話報警
Jay! Go call 911!

1156
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,160
把水管放下
Put the hose down.

1157
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:33,290
住手...
Stop it! Stop it!

1158
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,390
對不起
Sorry.

1159
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:55,860
我們需要談談
We need to talk.

1160
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,380
好啊
OK.

1161
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,350
從何談起
Where to begin?

1162
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,690
談你經常請假的事
With your constant absenteeism?

1163
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:07,720
還是你儀容不整的事?
With your unpresentable appearance?

1164
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,970
你馬上就要接受年度考核了
You're up for review.

1165
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:13,010
我一點也不驚訝
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1166
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:15,200
- 什麼?  - 來假設一下
- What? - Let's pretend.

1167
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,680
假如你是交通工具部門的人
You're the Department of Transportation, OK?

1168
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,520
當有人跟你說在撞擊測試時
Someone informs you that this company

1169
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:26,110
前座支架沒有通過考驗
installs front-seat mounting brackets that failed collision tests,

1170
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:29,680
車齡超過1千英里時 ?車就壞掉
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1171
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:33,590
燃油噴射系統會爆炸 會燒死人
and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.

1172
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,150
你會怎麼辦?
What then?

1173
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,930
你在威脅我?
Are you threatening me?

1174
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,800
- 不是...  - 出去 你被開除了
- No... - Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1175
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,730
我有個更好的解決辦法
I have a better solution.

1176
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:47,440
把我轉成外聘人員 只要付我薪水就行了
Keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary,

1177
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,520
我就不把這些事說出去
my job will be never to tell people these things that I know.

1178
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,900
我不用上班 在家工作就好
I don't even have to come into the office. I can do this job from home.

1179
01:16:57,050 --> 01:17:01,750
你以為你是誰? 你這個瘋子
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?

1180
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,610
警衛?
Security!

1181
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,790
這下我可要好好報復他了
I am Jack's smirking revenge.

1182
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,070
你在幹嘛?
What the hell are you doing?

1183
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:32,380
很痛啊!
That hurt.

1184
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:35,890
你為什麼要打我?
Why would you do that?

1185
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,650
天? 我求求你快住手
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1186
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:51,360
你要幹嘛?
What are you doing?

1187
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,700
天? 我求求你不要
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1188
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:58,110
我想起第一次跟泰勒打的情形
For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.

1189
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,380
不...
No!

1190
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:27,400
到了現在 這傢伙
Under and behind and inside everything

1191
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,050
徹底知道...
this man took for granted,

1192
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:33,250
這件事真的大條了
something horrible had been growing.

1193
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:38,620
你只要付我薪水就行了 我不會再出現的
Look, give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again.

1194
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:42,240
那是我跟他在一起最棒的一刻
Then, at our most excellent moment together...

1195
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:47,270
求求你不要再打了 不要再打我了
Thank God! Please don't hit me again.

1196
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:49,470
電話 電腦
Telephone, computer,

1197
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:54,790
傳真機 52張週薪支票 還有48份飛機折價券
fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.

1198
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:57,300
我們成了互相贊助商
We now had corporate sponsorship.

1199
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:02,350
從此我們每天都能去俱樂部
This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.

1200
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,270
如今 在俱樂部裡 場中的人才是主角
Now, the center of Fight Club became the two men fighting.

1201
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:12,150
領導人行蹤非常低調
The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.

1202
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:20,800
泰勒因為在湯裡尿尿 被飯店的人起訴
Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup.

1203
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,660
生命已被我自己毀了
I am Jack's wasted life.

1204
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,770
謝謝你
Thank you, sir.

1205
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:43,280
泰勒設計了新的作業
Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.

1206
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,240
裝在封好的信封袋裡
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.

1207
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:29,160
- 聽說達勒威也有搏擊俱樂部  - 我也聽說了
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City. - Yeah, I heard.

1208
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,770
賓城好像也有
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1209
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:35,260
鮑伯在新塞也發現一個
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1210
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,560
- 那是你成立的嗎?  - 不是 我以為是你成立的
- Did you start that one? - No, I thought you did.

1211
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:40,300
才不是
No.

1212
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:31,900
- 停一下  - 幹嘛?
- Stop for a second. - Hey, what are we doing?

1213
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,900
- 轉過去  - 我們要幹嘛?
- Turn around. - What are we doing?

1214
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,360
完成任務
Homework assignment.

1215
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,760
哪一種任務?
What kind homework assignment?

1216
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,360
人性的犧牲
Human sacrifice.

1217
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,820
那是槍嗎?
Is that a gun?

1218
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,730
- 告訴我那個不是槍  - 是槍沒錯
- Please tell me it's not. - It's a gun.

1219
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,060
- 你要幹什麼?  - 到後面等我
- What are you doing? - Meet me in the back.

1220
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:46,360
- 不要跟我鬧了  - 到後面等我
- Don't fuck around! - Meet me in the back.

1221
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,670
在這種時刻
On a long enough time line,

1222
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:52,330
不管是誰都會以為死期已至
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

1223
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:54,600
你幹嘛? 別這樣

什麼時候的事?
When did that happen?

1286
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,060
你真的在乎嗎?
Do you care?

1287
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:41,400
我不知道 很久沒想到她了
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1288
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,300
啊哈
Yeah, well...

1289
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,770
或許她死了也好
It was the smart move on her part.

1290
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,910
等等
Listen...

1291
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:53,680
你這樣做有什麼好處?
What are you getting out of all this?

1292
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,150
什麼?
What?

1293
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:59,220
你為什麼一直...
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1294
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,220
這樣做會讓你開心嗎?
Is this making you happy?

1295
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,020
有時候啊
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1296
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,360
我不懂...
I don't know. I don't understand.

1297
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:12,000
為什麼虛弱的人總想往強壯的人靠攏
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person?

1298
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,540
為什麼?
What is... What is that?

1299
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,010
你又得到了什麼?
What do you get out of it?

1300
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:21,270
這是兩回事
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1301
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:24,070
我們兩人完全不同
It's totally different with us.

1302
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:24,940
我們?
Us?

1303
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,140
那是什麼意思?
What do you mean by us?

1304
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,850
- 沒什麼 你聽到了嗎?  - 聽到什麼?
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this? - Hear what?

1305
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,650
- 下面有聲音啊 你沒聽到嗎?  - 等等
- All that noise. Hold on. - No, wait!

1306
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,950
你說什麼?
What did you say?

1307
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:35,720
別改變話題 我得跟你好好談談
Don't change the subject! I want to talk about this.

- 你們在談什麼?  - 沒什麼...
- What are you talking about? - Nothing. Nothing.

1311
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,600
我想不是吧
I don't think so.

1312
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,000
你到底想怎樣?
What do you want?

1313
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:48,630
看著我
Look at me.

1314
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,400

01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:54,300
- 這是什麼?  - 沒什麼 不用擔心
- What is that?! - It's nothing. Don't worry.

1316
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,470
天哪 這是誰弄的?
My God. Who did this?

1317
01:26:56,610 --> 01:26:57,310
一個人
A person.

1318
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:58,780
男的還是女的?
Guy or girl?

1319
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,470
你管那麼多幹嘛?
What do you care?

1320
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,850
你幹嘛不讓我問?
What do you care if I ask?

1321
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,720
- 不關你的事  - 你不敢說
- Leave me alone. - You're afraid to say.

1322
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,080
- 我不怕 放開我  - 不要...告訴我

1326
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,790
我就是沒辦法討好你 對吧?
I just can't win with you, can I?

1327
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,440
我們這樣太老套了吧
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1328
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,410
這怎麼回事?
What is... What is all this?

1329
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,580
你說呢?
What do you think?

1330
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,940
為什麼要做上下鋪?

1331
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:48,990
你太年輕 抱歉
Too young. Sorry.

1332
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:51,130
那是幹嘛?
What's all that?

1333
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:54,210
若應徵人很年輕 就說他們太幼齒
If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young.

1334
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,370

Training for what?

1339
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:11,220
你以為這是兒戲?
You think this is a game?

1340
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,450
你太幼齒了 不能接受訓練
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1341
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,690
別浪費我們的時間 快滾
Quit wasting our time. Get the fuck out of here.

1342
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:23,520
給你個壞消息
Bad news, friend.

1343
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,370
這是不可能的
It's not gonna happen.

1344
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,600
你必須要諒解
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1345
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,470
這並非世界末日

別瞪著我
Don't you look at me!

1350
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:47,920
你以為你這樣就可以進來? 不可能的

你太老了 肥仔
You're too old, fat man.

1363
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:38,340
你的奶子太大了 別站在我走廊上
Your tits are too big. Get the fuck off my porch.

1364
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,580
鮑伯...
Bob! Bob!

1365
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,240
像準備升空的猴子一樣
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1366
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:08,110
太空猴...

犧牲自己換取劃時代的成果

你們兩個都給我滾
Get out of here, the both of you!

1373
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:31,000
接下去一直這樣持續著...
And so it went.

1374
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,230
留神聽著 你們這群蛆
Listen up, maggots.

1375
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,730
你不是什麼特別的人物

你不是一片美麗的獨一無二的雪花
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1377
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,700
你跟其他生物是同樣的有機物
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.

1378
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,990
泰勒組織了一支軍隊
Tyler built himself an army.

1379
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:49,620
我們只是來這世界走一遭罷了
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.

1380
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:53,830
跟其他生物沒什麼兩樣
We are all part of the same compost heap.

1381
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:57,630
泰勒德頓為什麼要組織軍隊?
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?

1382
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:00,700
有什麼目的?
To what purpose?

1383
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:02,930
用意是好還是壞?
For what greater good?

1384
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,770
只要是泰勒 我們完全信任
In Tyler we trusted.

1385

每次他說 工作不代表你 我就這樣...對!
When he was like, "You are not yourjob", I was like, "Yeah!"

1386
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,150
這是怎麼回事?
Hey, what's all this?

1387
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:26,730
好了
OK!

Could you tell us what you think has happened here?

1394
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,595

1395
01:32:01,595 --> 01:32:05,030
地下搏擊俱樂部有關
somehow related to underground boxing clubs.

1396
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:09,200
我們準備展開專項調查行動
We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.

1397
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,810
這就是傑克柏署長的談話
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene

1398
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:17,550

現在將現場交回攝影棚內的主播
Back to you in the studio.

1400

1402
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,620
你們做了什麼?
What the fuck did you guys do?

1403
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:48,640
大破壞計畫第一條規則是...不可以有疑問
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir.

1404
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:59,550
對付犯罪不能有拖延
The victory in the war against crime will not come overnight.

1405

需要各位的堅持和忠誠
It will take dedication and commitment and,

1406
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,860
最重要的 是合作
most of all, cooperation.

1407
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:08,100
街頭比以前安全 市區秩序有了希望
Streets are safer now. There is hope in the inner city.

1408
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:09,270
然而 這才僅僅是開始
However...This is only the begin.

1409
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:11,670
我要上廁所
I gotta take a piss.

1410
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:18,900
前程漫漫 所以才設計"希望"計畫
These are the first steps in a long journey. That is why we have created Project Hope.

1411
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:22,000
它所涵蓋的範圍是全面性的
Project Hope will be ajoint effort

1412
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,680
這個計畫需要大家的合作
between the police and community leaders.

1413
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:31,850
不論是警方或是地方政府...這是對抗犯罪的新武器
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.

1414
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:21,540

- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack. - His balls are ice cold.

1415
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:26,880
你必須取消專項調查計畫
Hi. You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation.

1416
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,180
開個記者會 宣佈並沒有什麼地下組織 否則...
You will publicly state there is no underground group or

1417
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,010
他們會割掉你的卵蛋

1420
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:42,420
你要追查的人都是你所依靠的人
Look. The people you are after are the people you depend on.

1421
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:44,500
他們替你煮飯 替你倒垃圾
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.

1422
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:50,120
替你接電話線 替你開救護車 你睡覺時 替你守門
We connect your calls. We drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep.

1423
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,340
千萬不要惹我們
Do not fuck with us.

1424
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,450
別搞丟你的蛋蛋
Ball check!

1425
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:24,210

1426
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:26,610
我們走!!
Let's go.

1427
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:31,170
我感覺到事情跟以前不一樣了
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.

1428
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,410
我覺得我該射殺貓熊
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda

1429
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:28,270
雖然它們極力爭取生存
that wouldn't screw to save its species.

1430
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:36,150
我想用汙油將法國海灘污染
I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother those French beaches I'd never see.

1431
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:42,150
我想要呼吸混濁的空氣
I wanted to breathe smoke.

1432

1436
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,680
別擔心 機場寄車 可以借用很久
Don't worry, Mr Durden. Airport parking. Long term.

1437
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:30,460
你先請 德頓先生
After you, Mr Durden.

1438

- Something on your mind, dear? - No.

1440
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:57,590
為何不告訴我大破壞計畫?
Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?

1441
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,650

1443
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,860
為什麼不一開始就讓我參與?
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1444
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,760
搏擊俱樂部已經從地下室裡搬出來了
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left the basements

1445
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:08,300
改名成大破壞計畫
and it's Project Mayhem.

1446
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:10,700
搏擊俱樂部是我們倆一起創造的
We started Fight Club together. Remember?

1447
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,530
是我們兩個人共同擁有的

是啊 我倆一起合作的啊?

那是什麼意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

1467
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,540
你要幹嘛?
What are you doing?

1468
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,550
你們在死前想做什麼?

Fine.

1492
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:10,980
我從沒出過車禍
I'd never been in a car accident.

1493
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:13,710
在我替那些車禍算出數字前
This must have been what all those people felt like

1494
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:16,900
那些受難者都經過這個痛苦吧
before I filed them as statistics in my reports.

1495
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:19,690
可惡
Goddamn!

1496
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:25,750
這是全新的生命體驗
We've just had a near-life experience!

1497
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:35,000
在你的世界裡 你不自覺的
In the world I see, you're stalking elk through the Grand Canyon forests

1498
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,660
被限制住
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1499
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:43,570
你的衣著為外界所定型
You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.

1500
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:49,670
為了生存遺忘本身的才能
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.

1501
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,650
應該往下看著密密麻麻的小生物
And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1502
01:41:54,650 --> 01:42:00,360
高速公路上只是空蕩蕩的
laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool lane of some abandoned superhighway.

1503
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:16,580
好好照顧你自己
Feel better, champ.

1504
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,230
然後...
And then...

1505
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,930
泰勒?
Tyler?

1506
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:38,200
泰勒走了
..Tyler was gone.

1507
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:48,360
我睡著了嗎?
Was I asleep?

1508
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,640
我有睡著嗎?
Had I slept?

1509
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,110
突然間這房子活了起來
The house had become a living thing.

1510
01:42:57,250 --> 01:43:01,880
這麼多人在裡面流汗呼吸
Wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.

1511
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:05,020
這麼多人活動 房子都動了起來
So many people moving, the house moved.

1512
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:09,950
像個泰勒星球
Planet Tyler.

1513
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:11,990
我只能面對空牆
I had to hug the walls.

1514
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:15,130
困在這幫太空猴中間
Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.

1515
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,260
你不能夠在這裡抽煙...
You shouldn't be smoking in here! You know how much ether is here!

1516
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,180
一群人煮飯 工作 睡覺
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.

1517
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:26,250
等等...
Hang on a second.

1518
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:48,040
一切都在控制當中 長官
It's under control, sir.

1519
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,040
泰勒哪去了?
Where's Tyler?

1520
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,570
長官 大破壞行動第一條規則
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not...

1521
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:55,580
不可以有疑問
ask questions.

1522
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:56,840
好...
Right... OK.

1523
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:00,610
我變孤獨了
I'm all alone.

1524
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:03,350
我父親拋下我
My father dumped me.

1525
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,820
泰勒也拋下我
Tyler dumped me.

1526
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:07,890
我徹底的心碎了
I am Jack's broken heart.

1527
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:15,990
大破壞行動下一步是什麼? 只有泰勒知道
What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.

1528
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:19,260
第二條規則 是不能有疑問
The second rule is you do not ask questions.

1529
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:25,470
你們給我滾開 你們給我滾開!
Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away!

1530
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,930
這些人是誰?
Who are all these people?

1531
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,710
請來的清潔公司人員
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1532
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:39,110
我可以進去嗎?
Can I come in?

1533
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,320
他不在
He's not here.

1534
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:46,660
什麼?
What?

1535
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,460
泰勒不在裡面
Tyler isn't here.

1536
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,390
泰勒走了
Tyler went away.

1537
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,210
他走了
Tyler's gone.

1538
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:29,800
有人受槍傷了 快走開
Two gunshot wounds coming through! Make some fucking room!

1539
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:33,210
怎麼回事? 怎麼回事?
What happened? What happened?

1540
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,370
我們去處理一項任務
We were on assignment. We were supposed to kill

1541
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,070
一石二鳥的任務
two birds with one stone.

1542
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:39,620
毀掉一件藝術品
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1543
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:42,140
開始行動...
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1544
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:46,020
順便碾碎一個連鎖咖啡店
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1545
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,920
全部都按計劃執行著 長官
We had it all worked out, sir.

1546
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,660
本來都很順利的 可是...
It went smooth until...

1547
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:06,330
員警 別動...
Police! Freeze!

1548
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:07,640
可是怎樣?
What?

1549
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:09,010
他們開槍射中了鮑伯
They shot Bob.

1550
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:11,780
射中了他的頭
They shot him in the head.

1551
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:13,140
那些豬頭
Fucking pigs!

1552
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:20,420
天啊
Oh, God!

1553
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:24,680
- 那些混蛋  - 你們這些白癡
- Those motherfuckers! - You morons.

1554
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,725
你們到處破壞 炸毀東西
You're running around in ski masks trying to blow things up?

1555
01:46:27,725 --> 01:46:30,770
還希望下場能怎樣?
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1556
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:34,755
我們得快點 我們要掩滅證據
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.

1557
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:37,000
要把屍體處理掉
We gotta get rid of this body!

1558
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,970
- 埋了他  - 什麼?
- Bury him. - What?

1559
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:40,980
帶到花園裡埋了他
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1560
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:45,120
- 快點  - 動作快點
- Come on, people, let's go! - Get the fuck off!

1561
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,510
走開...
Get away from him!

1562
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:48,150
你說什麼?
What are you talking about?

1563
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,350
他才不是什麼證據
This isn't fucking evidence.

1564
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:51,510
他是個人
This is a person.

1565
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:52,420
他是我的朋友
He's my friend and you're

1566
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,750
不准你們把他埋在花園裡
not burying him in the garden!

1567
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:57,520
他在大破壞行動中殉職 長官
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1568
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:58,830
他是鮑伯啊
This is Bob.

1569
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:01,420
長官 在大破壞行動中
Sir, in...in Project Mayhem,

1570
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:02,330
我們都沒有名字
we have no names.

1571
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:04,060
你聽我說
Now, you listen to me.

1572
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,670
他是個人 他有名字
This is a man and he has a name,

1573
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:07,690
他叫做鮑伯寶森
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1574
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,170
鮑伯寶森
Robert Paulsen.

1575
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:12,660
他是個人 是因我們而死的
He's a manand he's dead now because of us.

1576
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:14,100
你們懂嗎?
Do you understand that?

1577
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:15,770
我瞭解了
I understand.

1578
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:24,150
死了之後 我們的人就有名字
In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.

1579
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:26,220
他的名字是鮑伯寶森
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1580
01:47:28,090 --> 01:47:29,220
他的名字是鮑伯寶森
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1581
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:33,300
他的名字是鮑伯寶森
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1582
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:37,140
他的名字是鮑伯寶森
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1583
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:38,490
拜託 別這樣啦
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1584
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,970
他的名字是鮑伯寶森...
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1585
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,170
閉嘴 不是要這樣子
Shut up! This is all over with!

1586
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:49,180
他的名字是鮑伯寶森
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1587
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:07,230
我要去找泰勒

1588
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:16,060
芝加哥

1589
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:17,900
亞特蘭大

1590
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:21,980
泰勒?
Tyler?

1591
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:25,040
不是 我是縱火組的史頓警探
No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1592
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:27,050
我要請你明天早上到局裡談談
I need to see you...

1593
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:34,220
我去泰勒到過的每個地方
I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.

1594
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:39,060
我不知道怎麼回事 但只要看到某個酒吧
I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars,

1595
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:41,200
我就知道那裡有問題
and somehow I just knew.

1596
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:44,160
我要找泰勒德頓 我一定要跟他談談
I'm looking for Tyler Durden. It's very important that I talk to him.

1597
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,360
我也希望我能幫到你
I wish I could help you,

1598
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:49,070
長官
sir.

1599
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:57,300
不管我到什麼地方
Every city I went to,

1600
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,450
只要我一下飛機
as soon as I set foot off the plane

1601
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:03,080
就能感覺附近有搏擊俱樂部
I knew a Fight Club was close.

1602
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,850
你看我的臉 我也是會員
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1603
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,020
我只想知道你看到泰勒了嗎?
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1604
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:15,760
我不能將這種訊息告訴你
I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you

1605
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:19,460
也不能將有關的情報告訴你
nor would I, even if I had said information at this juncture,... be able.

1606
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:24,810
- 你是白癡  - 我得要求你離開
- You're a moron. - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1607
01:49:26,410 --> 01:49:28,000
泰勒一直很忙碌
Tyler had been busy...

1608
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:30,810
忙著在全國設立分會
setting up franchises all over the country.

1609
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:35,580
我在睡覺嗎?
Was I asleep?

1610
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:38,280
我睡過嗎?
Had I slept?

1611
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:41,190
泰勒是我的夢魘或我是他的?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?

1612
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:43,480
我只知道一個傳說
We've just heard the stories.

1613
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,720
什麼傳說
What kind of stories?

1614
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:46,390
沒有人知道他長什麼樣子
Nobody knows what he looks like.

1615
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:49,060
他每三年就動一次變臉手術
He has plastic surgery every three years.

1616
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:51,860
那是我聽過的最蠢的事
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

1617
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,790
邁阿密真的有搏擊俱樂部?
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?

1618
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:56,400
泰勒是不是在組織軍隊?
Is Mr Durden building an army?

1619
01:49:56,990 --> 01:50:00,790
我一直活在似曾相似的情境中
I was living in a state of perpetual

1620
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:02,780
每到一個地方
Everywhere I went,

1621
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:04,910
我都覺得自己好像也去過
I felt I'd already been there.

1622
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:07,580
就像跟蹤一個隱者一樣
It was like following an invisible man.

1623
01:50:09,490 --> 01:50:11,040
有幹血的味道
The smell of dried blood,

1624
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:14,610
到處都是骯髒的腳印
dirty, bare footprints circling each other.

1625
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:18,090
還有烤雞一般的味道
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.

1626
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:22,560
我還能感受前一晚的打鬥感覺
The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.

1627
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:25,760
我每次都比泰勒晚一步
I was always just one step behind Tyler.

1628
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:34,180
他的名字是鮑伯寶森...
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1629
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:38,960
歡迎你回來 長官
Welcome back, sir.

1630
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:41,040
你好嗎?
How have you been?

1631
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:43,820
你認識我?
Do you know me?

1632
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,740
這是測試嗎 長官?
Is this a test, sir?

1633
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,770
不是 不是測試
No. This is not a test.

1634
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:51,250
你上星期四來過了啊
You were in here last Thursday.

1635
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:53,880
星期四?
Thursday?

1636
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:58,260
你就站在那個地方 問我這裡的警衛狀況好不好
You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is.

1637
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:00,680
情況很好 長官
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1638
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:04,370
你認為我是誰?
Who do you think I am?

1639
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:08,150
你真的不是在測試我?
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1640
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:09,440
不是 我沒有在測試
No, this is not a test.

1641
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,320
你是德頓先生
You're Mr Durden.

1642
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,780
這是你給我的
You're the one who gave me this.

1643
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:20,820
請系上安全帶 將座椅推到鎖定的位置
Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.

1644
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:34,540
- 喂?  - 瑪拉 是我
- Yeah? - Marla, it's me.

1645
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:35,630
我們做過嗎?
Have we ever done it?

1646
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:36,540
做什麼?
Done what?

1647
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,730
我們做過愛嗎?
Had sex?

1648
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:39,890
那是什麼蠢問題?
What kind of stupid question is that?

1649
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,740
為什麼蠢? 就因為問我們做過還是沒做過?
Stupid because it's yes or because it's no?

1650
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:45,240
- 你在惡作劇嗎?  - 不是 我必須知道...
- Is this a trick? - No. I need to know...

1651
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:47,980
你不知道我們有沒有做過愛?
You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love?

1652
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:52,750
- 我們做過了?  - 你就打電話來問這個?
- We did make love? - Is that what you're calling it?

1653
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:56,000
回答我的問題 到底有沒有?
Just answer the question! Did we do it or not?!

1654
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,500
你幹了我 又甩掉我
You fuck me, then snub me.

1655
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,680
你愛過我 又討厭我
You love me, you hate me.

1656
01:51:58,830 --> 01:52:00,230
你一會兒感情豐富
You're sensitive,

1657
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:01,320
一會兒又變成冷酷的混蛋
then you turn into an asshole.

1658
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:04,150
這樣描述我倆的關係夠了吧? 泰勒
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1659
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:06,390
我的血液溫度降到了冰點
We just lost cabin pressure.

1660
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:07,930
你說什麼?
What did you just say?

1661
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:08,970
你怎麼回事?
What is wrong with you?

1662
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,470
你剛才叫我什麼? 說一次我的名字
Say my name!

1663
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:12,870
泰勒德頓 泰勒德頓啊 神經病
Tyler Durden! You fucking freak! What's going on?

1664
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:16,410
- 怎麼回事? 我馬上過去  - 等一下 瑪拉 我不在那裡
- I'm coming over! - I'm not there!

1665
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:19,200
你沒有遵守你的誓言
You broke your promise.

1666
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,240
天啊 泰勒
Jesus, Tyler.

1667
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:24,650
- 你怎麼可以跟她說我的事  - 怎麼回事?
- You fucking talked to her about me. - What the fuck is going on?

1668
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,210
我只要求你做這一件事
I asked you for one thing.

1669
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,920
一件非常簡單的事情
One simple thing.

1670
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:29,210
為什麼其他人都以為我是你?
Why do people think that I'm you?

1671
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:33,270
回答我啊
Answer me!

1672
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:37,530
坐下
Sit.

1673
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:42,990
回答我 為什麼其他人都以為我是你?
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1674
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:45,260
你知道的
I think you know.

1675
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:48,240
- 我不知道  - 你知道的
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.

1676
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:50,510
為什麼其他人都以為我是你?
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?

1677
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:53,280
我不知道
I... I don't know.

1678
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:01,000
- 你想到了  - 不會吧
- You got it. - No.

1679
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,490
千萬別惹我們
Do not fuck with us!

1680
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:03,880
說啊
Say it.

1681
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:06,520
因為...
Because...

1682
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:09,030
說啊
Say it!

1683
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,180
因為我們是同一個人
Because we're the same person.

1684
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,390
沒錯
That's right.

1685
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,010
我們都只是來這世界走一遭
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.

1686
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:19,410
我不懂
I don't understand this.

1687
01:53:19,410 --> 01:53:21,470
你想改變你的生活
You wanted a way to change your life.

1688
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:23,670
但是你一個人辦不到
You could not do this on your own.

1689
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:26,310
你一直想要變成...
All the ways you wish you could be,

1690
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:27,700
我這個的樣子
that's me.

1691
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:30,940
我長得像你希望的樣子 做愛像你希望的樣子
I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1692
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,960
我很聰明 有能力 最重要的是
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1693
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,790
我很自由 而你卻相反
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1694
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:37,520
不...
Oh, no.

1695
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:39,890
- 泰勒不在 他離開了 他走了  - 什麼?
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. - What?

1696
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,500
不會吧 這太瘋狂
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1697
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,070
每天都有很多人這樣
People do it every day.

1698
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,170
他們自言自語 看著自己
They talk to themselves. They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1699
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:52,210
但他們沒有你的勇氣 不敢去做
They don't have the courage you have to just run with it.

1700
01:53:55,650 --> 01:53:57,980
為什麼不能這樣呢?
You still wrestle with it,

1701
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,110
你有時候還是你自己
so sometimes you're still you.

1702
01:53:59,110 --> 01:54:00,880
我們有機會應該常常這樣
We should do this again sometime.

1703
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,220
有時候你以為你在看著我
At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1704
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,320
若今晚是你一次參加俱樂部
If this is your first time,

1705
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:06,180
就必須打
you have to fight.

1706
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,560
漸漸地...你讓自己變成了...
Little by little, you're just letting yourself become

1707
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:13,590
泰勒德頓
Tyler Durden.

1708
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:16,690
工作不代表你 財產也不代表你
You are not yourjob or how much money you have!

1709
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:19,030
- 不 你有房子  - 是你租的!
- No. You have a house. - Rented in your name.

1710
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:21,730
- 你有工作 你有生活  - 你晚上兼差 因為你睡不著
- You have jobs, a life. - You work nights because you can't sleep.

1711
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:24,540
所以你作肥皂
Or you stay up and make soap.

1712
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,270
- 你為什麼要跟瑪拉上床?
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

1713
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:28,110
技術上來說 跟她上床的人是你
Technically, you are.

1714
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:30,040
對她來說都是你
It's all the same to her.

1715
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,810
天哪
Oh, my God.

1716
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:35,510
你發現難題了吧?
Now you see our dilemma.

1717
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:37,890
她知道的太多了
She knows too much.

1718
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:44,010
我們得考慮一個解決的方法
I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.

1719
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:46,420
你說什麼?
What... What are you saying?

1720
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:51,560
簡直是胡扯... 我不聽
This is bullshit. This is bullshit, I'm not listening to this!

1721
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:54,220
- 你發瘋了  - 沒有 瘋的是你
- You are insane! - No. You're insane.

1722
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,970
我們沒有時間說這些了
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1723
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:00,800
這裡就是所謂的劇情急轉直下
It's called a changeover.

1724
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,080
電影繼續下去
The movie goes on

1725
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:06,150
但是觀眾還是一頭霧水
and nobody in the audience has any idea.

1726
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:21,090
先生 你要退房了嗎?
Sir! Are you checking out?

1727
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:23,170
是的
Yeah. Bill me.

1728
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:25,560
請先付這兩通電話費
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1729
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:33,730
- 這通是什麼時候打的?  - 是淩晨2點到3點半間打的
- When were these made? - Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1730
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:41,680
我是否每天都提早睡覺?
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?

1731
01:55:41,790 --> 01:55:48,650
我後來有睡覺嗎? 我變成泰勒的時間越來越長了?
Have I been sleeping later? Have I been Tyler longer and longer?

1732
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,590
有人在嗎?
Is anybody here?

1733
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,320
似曾相識 又開始了
All over again.

1734
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:02,370
有足夠的肥皂 就可炸毀一切
With enough soap, one could blow up anything.

1735
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,900
天?
Oh, my God.

1736
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:11,810
1888號
1888.

1737
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,210
請問這是哪裡?
Who am I calling?

1738
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:15,910
法蘭克林街1888號?
1888 Franklin. This is maintenance.

1739
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:17,540
喂?
Hello?

1740
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:20,020
喂?
Hello?

1741
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:22,050
法蘭克林街1888號?
1888 Franklin Street?

1742
01:56:22,490 --> 01:56:24,190
對 有事嗎?
Yes. Can I help you?

1743
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,060
- 喂?  - 是
- Hello? - Yeah, yeah.

1744
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:32,060
有 我要跟你們老闆說話
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1745
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:33,100
我就是
Speaking.

1746
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,130
聽我說
OK, listen to me.

1747
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:37,040
你們大樓馬上有緊急事件發生
Something terrible is about to happen to your building.

1748
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:38,570
一切都在控制之中 長官
It's under control, sir.

1749
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:41,170
你說什麼?
Excuse me?

1750
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,440
別擔心我們 長官
Don't worry about us, sir.

1751
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:44,480
我們沒問題的
We're solid.

1752
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,610
2160號
2160.

1753
01:56:56,330 --> 01:56:59,150
瑪拉...瑪拉...等等
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1754
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,900
等等 我必須跟你談談 瑪拉...
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1755
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:08,200
你們這些光頭佬 總是找我麻煩 打我的手臂!
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom! They almost broke my arm!

1756
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,800
整天燒手指頭 臭死了
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1757
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,000
聽我說 我現在只相信你 你一定要聽我說
This needs a tremendous act of faith on your part, but hear me out.

1758
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,980
- 又來你那套花言巧語了  - 你要信任我
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. - A little more faith than that.

1759
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:25,110
你說什麼我都不想聽
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.

1760
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:26,690
你有權利...
You have every right to be...

1761
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:28,750
我只要一杯咖啡就好
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1762
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:31,660
長官 你點什麼都是免費的
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1763
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,720
為什麼免費?
Why is it free of charge?

1764
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,470
- 不要發問  - 管他的
- Don't ask. - Whatever.

1765
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:41,300
我要烤雞 湯 什麼都要
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1766
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:44,600
要乾淨的食物
Clean food, please.

1767
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,600
我建議不要是蛤蜊湯
In that case, may I advise against the clam chowder.

1768
01:57:47,710 --> 01:57:48,680
不要蛤蜊湯
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1769
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:53,610
我給你30秒
You got about 30 seconds.

1770
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:58,040
我知道我的行為很怪
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1771
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:02,060
感覺好像是兩面人
I know it seems there's two sides to me...

1772
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:04,080
兩面? 你根本是百面人
Two sides? You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.

1773
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,530
你要罵我什麼都可以
I know.

1774
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:07,790
我終於搞清楚了一件事
But I realized something important.

1775
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:08,450
什麼事?
What?

1776
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:11,530
我到現在才瞭解
The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1777
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:14,230
我倆的關係 重要的是
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1778
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,530
- 我對你一直很不好  - 是啊...
- I know I haven't treated you well. - Whatever.

1779
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,630
不...15秒 15秒
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1780
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,240
不要講話 完了就走
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.

1781
01:58:22,350 --> 01:58:23,870
我想說我很抱歉
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1782
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:26,850
我終於瞭解 我真的喜歡你 瑪拉
What I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla.

1783
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:30,780
真的?
You do?

1784
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:31,900
真的 我很喜歡你
I really do.

1785
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:35,915
我不希望因為我而帶給你厄運
I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me.

1786
01:58:35,915 --> 01:58:39,930
瑪拉 你有生命危險
Marla, your life is in danger.

1787
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,990
什麼?
What?

1788
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,060
你必須離開這裡
You need to leave town for a while.

1789
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:48,000
- 別留在大城市裡 去露營都行  - 你發神經病了
- Get out of any major city. Just go camping... - You're an insane person.

1790
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,470
沒有 我發現很可怕的事...
No. I've involved you in something terrible.

1791
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:51,630
不...閉嘴!
No. Shut up!

1792
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:54,070
- 你不安全  - 閉嘴...
- You're not safe. - Shut up!

1793
01:58:56,580 --> 01:59:00,000
我努力過了 我真的努力過了
Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.

1794
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,200
我知道
I know you did.

1795
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,990
你有些特點我很欣賞
There are things about you I like.

1796
01:59:03,090 --> 01:59:04,420
你很聰明 幽默
You're smart, funny.

1797
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:06,260
尤其床上功夫一流
You're spectacular in bed.

1798
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:08,080
可是...
But

1799
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:09,960
你實在很難相處
you're intolerable.

1800
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:12,460
你有很嚴重的情緒問題
You have very serious emotional problems.

1801
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:16,430
你應該去看心理...
Deep-seated problems for which you should seek professional help.

1802
01:59:16,430 --> 01:59:17,560
我知道 對不起
I know, and I'm sorry.

1803
01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:19,330
好 你對不起 我對不起 大家都對不起
You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1804
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:23,800
我無法再這樣繼續下去了
I can't do this any more.

1805
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:26,100
真的
I can't.

1806
01:59:26,210 --> 01:59:26,940
我也不想
And I won't.

1807
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:30,240
我要走了
I'm gone.

1808
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,010
你不可以這樣... 瑪拉 你不安全
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1809
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:38,520
- 瑪拉 你不瞭解  - 不要碰我 走開
- Marla, you don't understand! - Leave me alone!

1810
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,910
- 瑪拉 我只是想要保護你  - 放開我
- Marla, I am trying to protect you! - Let go!

1811
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:42,490
我不想再見到你了
I don't ever wanna see you again!

1812
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,490
沒關係 如果那是代價
That's fine...

1813
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:45,320
在這裡等
Here, wait right here!

1814
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,360
等一下
Hold it right there!

1815
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:52,930
安靜 安靜
Shut up! Shut up!

1816
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:55,500
帶這些錢上車去
Take this money and get on this bus.

1817
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:57,370
我保證以後絕對不騷擾你
I promise I won't bother you again.

1818
01:59:57,450 --> 01:59:59,340
安靜
Shut up!

1819
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:02,340
請你上車 請你上車
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1820
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:05,500
你為什麼要這樣做?
Why are you doing this?

1821
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:07,350
因為你的生命有危險
They think you're a threat.

1822
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:08,310
我現在沒辦法解釋
I can't explain it now,

1823
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:09,250
相信我就是了
just trust me!

1824
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:11,150
別讓我看見你要去哪裡 否則你就會有生命危險
If I know where you are, you won't be safe.

1825
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,380
我可不還你錢喔
I'll keep this,

1826
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,820
我把這當作你應該給我的
it's asshole tax.

1827
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:17,580
拿去吧 這幾天千萬不要到大城市去
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.

1828
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:18,920
泰勒
Tyler.

1829
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,290
你是我一生中遇過最可怕的人
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.

1830
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:38,600
你好
Hello.

1831
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,340
我要自首
I need you to arrest me.

1832
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:44,347
我是犯下好幾宗縱火 暴力
I am the leader of a terrorist organization responsible

1833
02:00:44,347 --> 02:00:48,244
及破壞行動的地下組織領導人
for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1834
02:00:48,244 --> 02:00:52,141
都會區或許有好幾百個人員
In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members.

1835
02:00:52,141 --> 02:00:56,040
目前至少有五個城市裝好炸彈 準備引爆
Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already.

1836
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:59,310
這是很有組織的行動
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1837
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:04,910
不用領導人物 也能做得到
with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership.

1838
02:01:04,910 --> 02:01:09,480
你們到佩波街1537號那裡查查
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1839
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,210
那是我們的總部
That's our headquarters.

1840
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:13,980
在房子後面的花園地下
In the back, buried in the garden,

1841
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:16,020
埋有鮑伯寶森的屍體
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1842
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,230
到地下室去 裡面有個浴缸
In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs

1843
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:25,540
那是專門做鹽酸的地方
that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1844
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:27,740
我相信他們最新的計畫
I believe the plan is to blow up

1845
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:30,840
是炸掉各家信用卡的總部
the headquarters of these credit card companies

1846
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:32,200
還有經濟大樓
and the TRW building.

1847
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,430
為什麼選擇這些大樓?
Why these buildings?

1848
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:37,840
為什麼要炸毀信用卡公司?
Why credit card companies?

1849
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:41,810
如果一切的記錄都被銷毀 我們全都會回到原來的起點
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero.

1850
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:45,040
你們最好查一下
You'll create total chaos.

1851
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:49,010
看好他 我去打個電話
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone call.

1852
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:03,500
我很佩服你的勇氣
I really admire what you're doing.

1853
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:04,460
什麼?
What?

1854
02:02:04,570 --> 02:02:06,870
這樣做需要很大的勇氣
You're a brave man to order this.

1855
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:08,110
你是個天才 長官
You're a genius, sir.

1856
02:02:08,250 --> 02:02:14,210
你說不管誰洩露大破壞行動 即使是你
You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you,

1857
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:15,740
也必須受罰
we gotta get his balls.

1858
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:20,170
反抗也沒用 你真的很堅強
Don't fight. It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1859
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:23,170
- 為我們樹立了一個榜樣  - 你們犯了一個很大的錯
- It will set an example. - You're making a big mistake!

1860
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:26,000
- 你說過你會說這句話  - 我不是泰勒德頓
- You said you'd say that. - I'm not Tyler Durden!

1861
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:27,710
你也說過你會說這句話
You told us you'd say that too.

1862
02:02:28,830 --> 02:02:29,950
我是泰勒德頓沒錯
All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1863
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:33,390
聽我說 我要下直接命令
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1864
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:35,560
我們要馬上放棄行動
We're aborting this mission now.

1865
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:37,730
你說你一定會說這句話
You said you would definitely say that.

1866
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,660
等一下
Hold on.

1867
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:46,720
你們瘋了 你們是員警啊!
Are you fucking out of your minds? You're police officers!

1868
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:49,790
要不要來點這個...
Is somebody timing this?

1869
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:54,920
給我閉嘴 可惡
Keep your mouth shut. Shit!

1870
02:02:57,250 --> 02:03:00,020
我們得到一些已經證實的消息
Some of this information checks out.

1871
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:03,500
- 準備到那裡去看看吧  - 好的
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street. - Be right there.

1872
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:05,500
嘿 等等
Hey, wait!

1873
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:10,090
- 我抓到了  - 長官 我們必須帶你去
- I got him. - Sir, we have to do this.

1874
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:12,020
- 停下  - 橡皮筋呢?
- Stop fighting! - Where's the rubber band?

1875
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:15,030
不要碰我 把刀放下 放下
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1876
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:19,700
退後
Back up.

1877
02:03:20,110 --> 02:03:21,700
馬上給我趴下
Face down on the floor right now!

1878
02:03:22,830 --> 02:03:25,110
快趴下
Get down on the floor!

1879
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:34,710
誰先出來 就先吃子彈
The first person that comes out of this door gets a lead salad! Understand?

1880
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:01,510
走開
Get away! Stay away!

1881
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,500
我一直跑
I ran.

1882
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:21,220
跑到全身快爆炸 快不能呼吸
I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.

1883
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:25,640
然後繼續跑
Then I ran some more.

1884
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:08,940
你在幹嘛
What the fuck are you doing?

1885
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:12,120
穿著內褲到處跑 夥計 你看起來象個神經病
Running around in your underpants! You look crazy!

1886
02:05:12,490 --> 02:05:14,980
我知道你的計畫
No. I'm onto you. I know what's going on here.

1887
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:17,960
別這樣嘛 我還要看好戲呢
Come on, then. I got us a great place to watch from.

1888
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:21,820
我們一起來吧
It'll be like pay-per-view.

1889
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:10,940
- 天?  - 你現在要幹嘛?
- Oh, Christ. - Now what are you doing?

1890
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:14,380
- 我要阻止這件事  - 為什麼?
- I'm stopping this. - Why?

1891
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:17,780
- 這是我們做過最偉大的事  - 不...我不能讓這種事發生
- The greatest thing you've ever done. - I can't let this happen.

1892
02:06:17,850 --> 02:06:21,190
其他10棟大樓裡還有炸彈呢
There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.

1893
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:23,680
去你的 我們從什麼時候開始殺人了?
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?

1894
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:24,690
那些大樓都是空的
The buildings are empty.

1895
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:28,550
大樓裡的警衛都是我們的人 我們不是在殺人 我們是在釋放那些人
We're not killing anyone. We're setting 'em free!

1896
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:32,200
鮑伯死了 他們一槍轟了他的頭
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1897
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:34,800
我要犧牲小我完成大我
You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs.

1898
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:39,570
我不理你了 你根本不存在
No. I'm not listening to you. You're not even there.

1899
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:48,640
要是我就不會這麼做
I wouldn't do that. Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1900
02:06:49,490 --> 02:06:50,450
如果你知道 我就會知道
If you know, I know.

1901
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:59,000
或許我知道你知道什麼 所以我花了整天的時間...
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent all day

1902
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,750
想著錯誤的那條線
thinking about the wrong ones.

1903
02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:10,870
你覺得怎樣?
You think?

1904
02:07:12,610 --> 02:07:13,970
不是綠色的
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1905
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:16,350
最好不要割斷綠色那條
Pull any one but the green one.

1906
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:24,110
請你不要這樣做
I asked you not to do that!

1907
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:32,110
可惡! 離那裡遠一點
Fuck! Tyler, get away from the van.

1908
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:37,730
離那裡遠一點
Tyler, I'm not kidding! Get away from the van!

1909
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:39,260
可惡
Goddamn it!

1910
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:50,670
好 你對你的好朋友開槍
OK. You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend

1911
02:07:50,780 --> 02:07:53,310
在400加侖的炸藥的旁邊
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1912
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:57,010
泰勒...
Cool it, Tyler!

1913
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:14,420
別這樣嘛 不要走
Come on! Don't go!

1914
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:53,200
什麼?
What?!

1915
02:09:38,690 --> 02:09:39,380
還有三分鐘
Three minutes.

1916
02:09:39,390 --> 02:09:42,620
精彩時刻就要到了
This is it.

1917
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:46,800
一切重新回到原來的起點
The beginning. Ground zero.

1918
02:09:46,860 --> 02:09:49,490
這大概就是我們的故事開始的地方吧
I think this is about where we came in.

1919
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:51,190
你想說幾句話紀念這個偉大的時刻嗎?
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1920
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,430
你說什麼?
I'm sorry?

1921
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:57,170
我還是沒想到要說什麼
I still can't think of anything.

1922
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:02,670
重演幽默片段
Flashback humor.

1923
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:08,280
越來越刺激了
It's getting exciting now.

1924
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:11,620
還有兩分鐘半
Two and a half.

1925
02:10:12,050 --> 02:10:13,520
想想我們過去的成就吧
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1926
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:19,630
我們將從這面窗戶外 看到經濟事件的歷史鏡頭
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history.

1927
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:22,960
離經濟自由時刻又近了一步
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1928
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:39,020
她怎麼會在這裡?
Why is she here?

1929
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:41,020
她逃不掉的
Tying up loose ends.

1930
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:44,080
放我下來
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1931
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:46,380
我求求你 不要這樣做
I beg you, please don't do this.

1932
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,750
不是我做的
I'm not doing this.

1933
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:48,980
是我們倆一起做的
We are doing this.

1934
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:50,550
- 我們兩個都想這樣  - 不是
- This is what we want. - No.

1935
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:52,560
我不想要這樣
I don't want this.

1936
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:55,630
沒錯 可是現在你的已經沒有意義了
Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1937
02:10:56,130 --> 02:10:57,220
我們得把你忘了
We have to forget about you.

1938
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:59,860
你是我腦中的聲音而已
You're a voice in my head.

1939
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:01,300
你也只是我腦中的聲音
You're a voice in mine!

1940
02:11:02,010 --> 02:11:04,840
- 為什麼我無法幹掉你?  - 你需要我
- Why can't I get rid of you? - You need me.

1941
02:11:04,870 --> 02:11:06,470
不 我真的 再也不需要你了
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1942
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:07,910
我是你創造出來的
You created me.

1943
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:11,350
我可不會為了讓自己好過點 就創造你這樣的東西出來
I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1944
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:12,550
負點責任吧
Take some responsibility.

1945
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,140
我有
I do.

1946
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:17,250
我願意為這一切負責 我接受這一切
I am responsible for all of it and I accept that.

1947
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:21,250
我求求你了 請你取消這一切吧
So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off.

1948
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:24,920
我曾經讓我們失望過嗎?
Have I ever let us down?

1949
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:29,360
因為我 你成長了不少吧?
How far have you come because of me?!

1950
02:11:35,370 --> 02:11:37,380
我會照顧著你的
I will bring us through this.

1951
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:41,640
跟以前一樣 我會保護你 即使你又哭又鬧
As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming

1952
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:44,570
最後你還是會感謝我的
and in the end you will thank me.

1953
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:46,790
我很感謝你
Tyler. Tyler.

1954
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:50,920
謝謝你為我做的一切
I'm grateful to you. For everything that you've done for me.

1955
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:53,090
可是這次太誇張了 我不想要這個
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1956
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:54,250
那你要什麼?
What do you want?

1957
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:56,090
回去做原來的爛工作?
Your shitjob back?

1958
02:11:56,230 --> 02:12:00,590
爛公寓 看爛電視劇 去他的! 我才不要這樣幹
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms? Fuck you! I won't do it.

1959
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:05,310
- 天啊 這事可不能夠發生  - 已經都準備好了 閉嘴
- This can't be happening. - It's already done, so shut up!

1960
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:07,270
60秒 乖點
60 seconds till CRI.

1961
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:14,310
我可以解決的 這些都是假的
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1962
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:18,240
你不是真實的 那槍...槍也不是真在你手上
You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand.

1963
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:22,070
槍在我手上
The gun's in my hand.

1964
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:29,120
你那樣做也沒有用的
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1965
02:12:38,010 --> 02:12:40,640
你幹嘛拿槍頂著自己的腦袋
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1966
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:42,870
不是我的頭 泰勒
Not my head, Tyler.

1967
02:12:43,410 --> 02:12:45,440
是我們兩個的頭
Our head.

1968
02:12:46,990 --> 02:12:49,040
很有趣
Interesting.

1969
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:54,720
你想要怎麼樣?
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1970
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:03,820
這可是我們倆的事
Hey. It's you and me.

1971
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:09,100
朋友?
Friends?

1972
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,000
泰勒
Tyler,

1973
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:17,330
我要你認真的聽我說
I want you to really listen to me.

1974
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:20,250
好的
OK.

1975
02:13:20,350 --> 02:13:22,570
我的眼睛睜開著
My eyes are open.

1976
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:42,230
什麼味道?
What's that smell?

1977
02:14:02,830 --> 02:14:06,450
- 其他人呢?  - 我不知道 怎麼回事?
- Where is everybody? - Oh, no. What's going on?

1978
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:08,250
德頓先生
Mr Durden!

1979
02:14:09,490 --> 02:14:10,010
天啊
Oh, my God!

1980
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:18,590
你...你沒事吧 長官?

1981
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:21,060
哦 是的 我沒事
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.

1982
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:23,100
你看起來很糟糕 長官 怎麼回事?
You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1983
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,310
哦 沒什麼 沒事的
Nothing, it's no problem.

1984
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:26,940
哦 不 長官...
No, no, no, sir.

1985
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:30,000
他說的很對 你看起來很不好 你需要馬上治療
He's not kidding. You look awful. You need assistance.

1986
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:30,910
我很好
I'm fine.

1987
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:34,020
你看 我很好 一切都很好
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1988
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:38,900
這是幹什麼?
Stop it!

1989
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:42,030
放開她
Let her go.

1990
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:43,900
你...
You!

1991
02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:46,070
嗨 瑪拉
Hi, Marla.

1992
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:50,730
把她留在這裡 你們把東西收拾一下 到樓下會合
Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.

1993
02:14:50,730 --> 02:14:51,700
你確定?
Are you sure?

1994
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:52,660
是的 我很確定
Yes, I'm sure.

1995
02:14:54,650 --> 02:14:58,870
你這個混蛋 你在玩什麼無聊的遊戲
You fucker! What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?!

1996
02:14:58,970 --> 02:15:01,000
居然帶我來...天? 你的臉...
Putting me on a...Oh, my God, your face!

1997
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:02,970
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1998
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:09,810
怎麼回事?
What happened?

1999
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:11,250
不要問
Don't ask.

2000
02:15:11,590 --> 02:15:12,140
你被槍打傷了
You're shot.

2001
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:12,880
沒錯
Yes, I'm shot.

2002
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:14,320
天啊
Oh, my God.

2003
02:15:15,490 --> 02:15:18,150
- 不敢相信他還能站著  - 真強悍!
- I can't believe he's standing. - One tough motherfucker.

2004
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:23,810
誰開的槍?
Who did this?

2005
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:28,580
我自己開的 找點棉紗來
I did, actually. Find some gauze.

2006
02:15:30,370 --> 02:15:31,770
你開槍射你自己?
You shot yourself?

2007
02:15:31,870 --> 02:15:33,070
對 沒事的
Yes, but it's OK.

2008
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:37,090
瑪拉 看著我 我真的沒事
Marla, look at me. I'm really OK.

2009
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:41,120
相信我 一切都沒事了
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

2010
02:15:54,430 --> 02:15:57,990
我們相遇的時候 碰巧是我人生中最詭異的一段時間
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
