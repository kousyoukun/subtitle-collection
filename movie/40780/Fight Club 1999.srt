<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>

160
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:51,815
<i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>

161
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:54,016
<i>She was a liar.</i>

162
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:56,185
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

163
00:11:56,262 --> 00:12:00,061
<i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

164
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:03,591
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

165
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:09,063
<i>And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

166
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,200
<i>Marla,</i>

167
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,746
<i>the big tourist.</i>

168
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,940
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

169
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,543
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

170
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:23,281
<i>I couldn't cry. So once again,</i>

171
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,449
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

172
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:38,905
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

173
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,440
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

174
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,672
<i>I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.</i>

175
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:49,740
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

176
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,252
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

177
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,187
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

178
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,727
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.</i>

179
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:02,285
<i>And you're never really awake.</i>

180
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,956
To begin tonight's communion,

181
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,763
Chloe would like to say a few words.

182
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:11,805
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

183
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:17,668
<i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around</i>

184
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,806
<i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>

185
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,375
Well, I'm still here.

186
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,880
But I don't know for how long.

187
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,815
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

188
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,892
But I've got some good news.

189
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:34,725
I no longer have any fear of death.

190
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:42,401
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

191
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,533
No-one will have sex with me.

192
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:51,113
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

193
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:55,174
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

194
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:58,950
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

195
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,784
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

196
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,020
Thank you, Chloe.

197
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,665
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

198
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:15,204
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

199
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:19,166
You step inside your cave and you walk...

200
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:22,371
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

201
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>Marla.</i>

202
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:29,944
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>

203
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,148
<i>But you can't.</i>

204
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:35,891
<i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>

205
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:39,556
<i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>

206
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:44,260
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

207
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,198
Slide.

208
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,115
OK. Let's partner up.

209
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:58,514
Pick someone special to you tonight.

210
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,817
Hey.

211
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:09,287
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

212
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:16,194
- I'm onto you.
- What?

213
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,398
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

214
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:21,270
Sorry?

215
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:26,337
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

216
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:30,646
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

217
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,312
So you're a tourist.

218
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:37,620
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

219
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:40,217
I saw you at testicular cancer!

220
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,922
I saw you practising this.

221
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,465
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

222
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:48,367
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

223
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,267
I'll expose you.

224
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,432
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

225
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:56,042
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

226
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,145
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

227
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,985
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

228
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,854
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

229
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,054
I've been coming for over a year.

230
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:16,360
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

231
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:20,300
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

232
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,362
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

233
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:26,734
Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:30,779
Share yourself... completely.

235
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,674
Look, you don't want to get into this.

236
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,810
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

237
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,186
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

238
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,350
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

239
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:45,988
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

240
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,227
No, wait a second. Hold on.

241
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,396
We'll split up the week, OK?

242
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,699
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

243
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,902
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

244
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:02,311
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

245
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:06,317
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

246
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,751
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

247
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,854
No. No.

248
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:13,585
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

249
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,458
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

250
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:20,863
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

251
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,731
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

252
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,328
So far, you have four. I only have two.

253
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:30,342
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

254
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,674
Now we both have three...

255
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,044
Hey! You left half your clothes.

256
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,764
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

257
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,897
I'm selling some clothes!

258
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,065
So! We each have three. That's six.

259
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:04,009
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

260
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,172
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

261
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:08,374
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

262
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,077
That's your favorite too?

263
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,678
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

264
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,849
Take the first and third Sunday.

265
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,193
Deal.

266
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,098
Looks like this is goodbye.

267
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,329
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

268
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,872
How's this for not making a big thing?

269
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,140
Hey, Marla!

270
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,640
Marla!

271
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:41,309
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

272
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,318
Should we?

273
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,480
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

274
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:55,155
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

275
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,132
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i>

276
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,537
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

277
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:07,667
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

278
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:11,704
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

279
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,745
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

280
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,790
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

281
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,257
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>

282
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,488
<i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>

283
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,531
<i>BWI.</i>

284
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,398
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

285
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,371
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

286
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,738
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

287
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,802
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

288
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,082
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

289
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,815
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

290
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,980
<i>Everywhere I travel,</i>

291
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,354
<i>tiny life.</i>

292
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,951
<i>Single-serving sugar and cream.</i>

293
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,826
<i>Single pat of butter.</i>

294
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,764
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

295
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,802
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos.</i>

296
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:06,771
<i>Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.</i>

297
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,734
<i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>

298
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,937
<i>they're single-serving friends.</i>

299
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:16,745
<i>Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.</i>

300
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:19,047
<i>That's all we get.</i>

301
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:21,053
<i>Welcome!</i>

302
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:27,355
<i>On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

303
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:31,160
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

304
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,633
The infant went through the windshield.

305
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:37,796
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

306
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,966
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

307
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:43,603
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

308
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,045
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

309
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,640
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

310
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,015
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

311
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:54,181
The father must have been huge.

312
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:57,487
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

313
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:59,584
Very modern art.

314
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:02,153
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>

315
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,962
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>

316
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:08,834
<i>Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

317
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,998
<i>A x B x C</i>

318
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,107
equals X.

319
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,804
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

320
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,904
we don't do one.

321
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:21,211
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

322
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,219
You wouldn't believe.

323
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:27,213
Which car company do you work for?

324
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,418
A major one.

325
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:35,831
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,</i>

326
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,199
<i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>

327
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:41,428
<i>Anything.</i>

328
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:54,013
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

329
00:21:56,955 --> 00:22:00,255
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

330
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:08,366
且無法或不願承擔安全卡所列明的義務
請要求機組人員為您調換座位"

331
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,228
It's a lot of responsibility.

332
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:14,535
Wanna switch seats?

333
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,076
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.

334
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:22,548
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

335
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,707
The illusion of safety.

336
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,043
Yeah. I guess so.

337
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,055
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

338
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:34,685
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

339
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:39,323
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

340
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,924
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

341
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,301
You accept your fate.

342
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,963
It's all right here.

343
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,203
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

344
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,144
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

345
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:55,307
That's...

346
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,815
That's an interesting theory.

347
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:02,949
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

348
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:05,118
What do you do for a living?

349
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:08,356
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

350
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:12,523
OK.

351
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,502
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

352
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,800
We have the exact same briefcase.

353
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:23,634
Soap.

354
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:27,410
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

355
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,915
The yardstick of civilization.

356
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,387
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

357
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,319
Tyler Durden.

358
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:39,658
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

359
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:42,732
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

360
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,633
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

361
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,171
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

362
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:59,208
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

363
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:05,215
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

364
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,847
Thank you.

365
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:09,050
How's it working out for you?

366
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,891
- What?
- Being clever?

367
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,362
Great.

368
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:17,424
Keep it up, then. Right up.

369
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,798
A question of etiquette.

370
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,864
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

371
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,249
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

372
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,618
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

373
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,928
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

374
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:53,199
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

375
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,503
But when a suitcase vibrates,

376
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:58,303
the throwers have got to call the police.

377
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:01,903
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten

378
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:04,074
it's an electric razor.

379
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:06,278
But... every once in a while

380
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:11,280
自慰器

381
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:16,120
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

382
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:22,260
所以法條必須含糊的使用"一個陽具"
而非, "你的陽具"

383
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:24,430
I don't own...

384
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,236
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.</i>

385
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:33,474
<i>My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.</i>

386
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:37,481
<i>Never mind.</i>

387
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:42,084
Hey! That's my car!

388
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,365
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>

389
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,491
<i>of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.</i>

390
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:56,197
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

391
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,364
<i>A foot of concrete is important</i>

392
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:02,741
<i>when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

393
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:06,713
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

394
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:10,810
<i>blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

395
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:19,558
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

396
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,503
There's... nothing up there.

397
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:37,980
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

398
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:49,182
Do you have somebody you can call?

399
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,387
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

400
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:54,364
<i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

401
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:07,576
<i>The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out</i>

402
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:11,549
<i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>

403
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:17,479
<i>燃氣夜以繼日的充滿
1700平方英尺的公寓 </i>

404
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:29,465
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

405
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,629
<i>Yeah?</i>

406
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,835
<i>I can hear you breathing...</i>

407
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:50,423
<i>If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

408
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:35,900
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

409
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,233
<i>- Tyler?
- Who is this?</i>

410
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:43,973
We met... We met on the airplane.

411
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,311
We had the same suitcase?

412
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,475
The clever guy?

413
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,918
<i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

414
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:55,551
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

415
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:59,857
<i>- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.</i>

416
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,693
<i>So what's up?</i>

417
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,394
Well.

418
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:09,564
You're not gonna believe this.

419
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,939
You know, it could be worse.

420
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:17,777
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

421
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:21,915
There's always that. I don't know.

422
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:25,114
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

423
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:27,283
That's the last sofa I'll need.

424
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,157
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

425
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:33,686
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

426
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:37,326
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

427
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,563
I was close to being complete.

428
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:42,199
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

429
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:45,037
All gone.

430
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:48,336
Do you know what a duvet is?

431
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,315
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

432
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:55,376
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

433
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:59,619
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

434
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,353
No.

435
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,418
What are we, then?

436
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:06,124
I dunno. Consumers.

437
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,258
Right. We're consumers.

438
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:11,634
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

439
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:15,640
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

440
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:19,179
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

441
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:21,339
television with 500 channels,

442
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:26,245
我內褲上印著誰的名字,
生發液, 偉哥, 減肥藥

443
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:29,186
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

444
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:32,748
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

445
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:36,592
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

446
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:39,997
I say never be complete.

447
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:42,093
I say stop being perfect.

448
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:44,229
I say let's evolve.

449
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:46,604
Let the chips fall where they may.

450
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,870
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

451
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,038
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

452
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:55,606
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

453
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:59,451
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

454
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,115
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

455
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:09,260
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

456
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:13,828
What?

457
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:17,065
The things you own end up owning you.

458
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,468
Do what you like, man.

459
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:25,647
Oh, it's late.

460
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:28,446
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

461
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:30,611
I should find a hotel.

462
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,448
What?

463
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:35,150
What?

464
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,318
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

465
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:40,488
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

466
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,330
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

467
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,963
What?

468
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,699
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

469
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,232
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

470
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,871
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

471
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,946
Would... Would that be a problem?

472
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,111
Is it a problem for you to ask?

473
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,351
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,784
Thanks.

475
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,958
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

476
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,468
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

477
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,505
What?

478
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:24,407
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

479
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,411
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>

480
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,979
<i>Tyler was a night person.</i>

481
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,313
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

482
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:35,548
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

483
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,614
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

484
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:45,761
需要有人把不同膠卷的相同膠片準確對接

485
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:49,768
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

486
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,567
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

487
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,733
That's the cue for a changeover.

488
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:59,576
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

489
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,911
Why would anyone want this shitjob?

490
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:05,179
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

491
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:08,780
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

492
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:13,850
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

493
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:18,194
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

494
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,667
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

495
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,337
Nice, big cock.

496
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,881
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

497
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:48,254
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

498
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:56,963
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.</i>

499
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,372
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

500
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:06,474
除了向龍蝦湯撒尿, 他還向蛋白糖餅放屁
還會向奶油蘑菇湯, 那個...

501
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,608
Go ahead, tell 'em.

502
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:10,676
You get the idea.

503
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:14,120
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

504
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:17,591
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

505
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:21,655
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

506
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:24,099
I don't wanna die without any scars.

507
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:28,468
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

508
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,838
So go crazy! Let it rip.

509
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,605
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

510
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:36,739
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

511
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:39,316
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

512
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,476
That's right.

513
00:34:41,553 --> 00:34:44,751
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

514
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:49,019
This is so fucking stupid.

515
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:02,100
Motherfucker!

516
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:04,267
He hit me in the ear!

517
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:07,541
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

518
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,706
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

519
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:11,512
No, that was perfect.

520
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,524
No, it's all right.

521
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:29,461
It really hurts.

522
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:31,963
Right.

523
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,535
Hit me again.

524
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,736
No, you hit me. Come on!

525
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,186
We should do this again sometime.

526
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:11,208
- Where's your car?
- What car?

527
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:24,056
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>

528
00:36:24,194 --> 00:36:26,425
<i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

529
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,396
<i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>

530
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,865
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

531
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:37,339
<i>There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

532
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,467
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

533
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:42,068
<i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>

534
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:44,681
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

535
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,643
Yep. That's you.

536
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,346
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

537
00:36:50,422 --> 00:36:52,480
Yeah, thanks.

538
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,490
<i>What a shithole.</i>

539
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:56,561
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

540
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:04,100
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

541
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,967
<i>There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

542
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,033
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

543
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:16,212
What have we here?

544
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:33,091
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

545
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:47,137
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>

546
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:51,449
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

547
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:55,820
<i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>

548
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,296
Can I be next?

549
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,769
All right, man.

550
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,869
Lose the tie.

551
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:27,288
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

552
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:36,664
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

553
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,566
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

554
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:42,865
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

555
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:45,533
<i>The previous occupant had been a shut-in.</i>

556
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:47,701
Hey, man. What are you reading?

557
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:52,145
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

558
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:58,543
"我是傑克的延髓, 沒有我
傑克就會心率不齊, 血壓不足, 呼吸不暢"

559
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:00,715
There's a whole series of these.

560
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,883
"I Am Jill's Nipples."

561
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:08,888
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

562
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:15,936
<i>After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.</i>

563
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,637
What?

564
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:23,306
<i>- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?</i>

565
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:30,547
<i>If you could choose,
who would you fight?</i>

566
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:32,715
I'd fight my boss, probably.

567
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,918
Really?

568
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:38,360
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

569
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,523
I don't know my dad.

570
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,533
I mean, I know him, but...

571
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:44,968
He left when I was like, six years old.

572
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:48,028
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

573
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,199
He did this every six years.

574
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:54,439
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

575
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,374
My dad never went to college.

576
00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:01,386
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

577
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:05,892
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

578
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:07,984
- He says, "Get ajob."
- Same here.

579
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,756
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

580
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,821
"Dad, now what?"

581
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:15,027
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

582
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:18,594
You can't get married.

583
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:21,432
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

584
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:23,999
We're a generation of men raised by women.

585
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:28,378
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

586
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:37,586
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

587
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,895
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

588
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:46,589
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

589
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:55,135
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

590
00:40:55,243 --> 00:40:57,303
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

591
00:40:57,446 --> 00:41:02,474
<i>I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.</i>

592
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:06,317
<i>I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.</i>

593
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:08,320
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

594
00:41:08,457 --> 00:41:12,087
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

595
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:15,028
<i>Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.</i>

596
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,123
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

597
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:19,327
Absolutely.

598
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:22,700
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

599
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:25,636
Because waste is a thief.

600
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,837
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

601
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:36,452
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

602
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:39,717
<i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>

603
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,951
<i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

604
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:44,493
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>

605
00:41:44,562 --> 00:41:46,655
<i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

606
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,934
Come on, you've gotta go home!

607
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,499
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

608
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:49,123
<i>Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>

609
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:51,255
Gentlemen!

610
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,124
Welcome to Fight Club.

611
00:42:56,236 --> 00:42:58,397
The first rule of Fight Club is

612
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:00,871
you do not talk about Fight Club.

613
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,570
The second rule of Fight Club is

614
00:43:03,978 --> 00:43:07,414
you do not talk about Fight Club!

615
00:43:07,548 --> 00:43:09,813
Third rule of Fight Club.

616
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:12,682
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

617
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:15,550
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

618
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:17,956
Only two guys to a fight.

619
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,891
Fifth rule.

620
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:22,657
One fight at a time, fellas.

621
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:25,233
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

622
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:29,236
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

623
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:33,667
And the eighth and final rule.

624
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,006
If this is your first night at Fight Club

625
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,173
you have to fight.

626
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,280
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

627
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,883
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

628
00:43:50,993 --> 00:43:56,830
<i>但瑞奇搏擊技術可是一流
此刻他擊潰了本地餐廳的領班</i>

629
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:04,038
<i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

630
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,837
<i>Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

631
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,939
Stop!

632
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,918
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

633
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,820
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

634
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:24,351
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

635
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:26,760
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

636
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,163
<i>Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.</i>

637
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:35,296
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

638
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:38,241
<i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>

639
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:42,275
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

640
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,475
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

641
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:49,513
Hemingway. You?

642
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:53,318
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

643
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,590
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

644
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:02,198
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

645
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:08,701
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

646
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:12,871
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

647
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,074
Is that what a man looks like?

648
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:18,815
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

649
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,977
Now, self-destruction...

650
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:23,079
Excuse me.

651
00:45:57,726 --> 00:46:00,923
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

652
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:03,055
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

653
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,459
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues</i>

654
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:10,538
<i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>

655
00:46:15,077 --> 00:46:17,170
- Is that it?
- Stop!

656
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:20,147
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>

657
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:22,150
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

658
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:25,016
Cool.

659
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,886
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

660
00:46:28,826 --> 00:46:31,090
Hey, man. How about next week?

661
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:33,253
How about next month?!

662
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:35,422
Irvine, you're in the middle.

663
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:37,558
New guy, you too.

664
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:41,464
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

665
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:43,665
He fell down some stairs.

666
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:46,401
I fell down some stairs.

667
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:52,910
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

668
00:46:53,017 --> 00:46:55,484
OK. Any historical figure.

669
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,452
I'd fight Gandhi.

670
00:46:58,089 --> 00:46:59,920
Good answer.

671
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:02,254
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

672
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,922
Lincoln?

673
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:08,624
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

674
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,593
Fuck!

675
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:15,467
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

676
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,949
Hello?

677
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,451
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>

678
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,851
<i>Marla?</i>

679
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:35,954
<i>- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.</i>

680
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,053
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

681
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:42,329
<i>We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

682
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:45,268
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

683
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:48,865
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

684
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:50,773
I found a new one.

685
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:53,575
- Really?
- It's for men only.

686
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,272
Like the testicle thing?

687
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:01,077
Look, this is a bad time.

688
00:48:01,154 --> 00:48:03,589
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

689
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:07,252
<i>- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.</i>

690
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:09,694
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

691
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:12,095
I took what was left of a bottle.

692
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,259
It might have been too much.

693
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,964
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

694
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:22,565
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

695
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,631
<i>這可能會扯幾個小時</i>

696
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:25,579
那你今晚就在家嘍?

697
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:28,514
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

698
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:33,111
<i>Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

699
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:38,019
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

700
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:09,155
<i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.</i>

701
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:17,224
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

702
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:20,599
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

703
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:32,383
What are you doing here?

704
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:37,179
What?

705
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:39,689
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

706
00:49:42,093 --> 00:49:44,084
Fuck you!

707
00:49:58,711 --> 00:50:02,078
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

708
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:04,172
Limber, though.

709
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,241
Silly cooze.

710
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,050
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

711
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:12,215
Guess who's on the other end?

712
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:14,486
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

713
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:20,392
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

714
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:23,300
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

715
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:26,998
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

716
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:34,403
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

717
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,108
10...

718
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:39,015
9...8...

719
00:50:39,087 --> 00:50:45,290
<i>泰勒這等人, 怎麼會在乎瑪拉·辛格的死活呢? </i>

720
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,020
5...

721
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:48,687
4...

722
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,523
Hang on.

723
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,303
You got here fast.

724
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:02,936
Did I call you?

725
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:16,750
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

726
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:22,396
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

727
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:27,101
Oh, fuck!

728
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,263
Somebody called the cops.

729
00:51:41,184 --> 00:51:44,677
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

730
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:49,357
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

731
00:51:49,426 --> 00:51:51,587
She has lost faith in herself.

732
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:54,528
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

733
00:51:54,598 --> 00:51:58,729
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

734
00:51:58,803 --> 00:52:02,602
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

735
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:11,978
要是睡著了, 我就死定了

736
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:18,314
你得讓我保持清醒, 一整晚哦

737
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,723
Un-fucking-believable.

738
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,988
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

739
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:26,758
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

740
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:28,959
- Never?
- No.

741
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:31,996
You're not into her, are you?

742
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:34,163
No! God, not at all.

743
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:36,834
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

744
00:52:36,976 --> 00:52:38,876
Are you sure? You can tell me.

745
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:40,842
Believe me, I'm sure.

746
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,246
<i>- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.</i>

747
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:47,080
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

748
00:52:49,055 --> 00:52:52,685
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

749
00:52:52,793 --> 00:52:54,454
My God.

750
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:57,894
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

751
00:52:58,031 --> 00:53:00,465
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

752
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:04,094
<i>The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>

753
00:53:04,204 --> 00:53:07,003
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

754
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:09,668
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

755
00:53:09,776 --> 00:53:12,644
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now my home.</i>

756
00:53:12,714 --> 00:53:14,807
Hey, hey. Sit down.

757
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:22,322
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

758
00:53:22,423 --> 00:53:24,254
Why would I...

759
00:53:24,325 --> 00:53:29,695
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

760
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:31,459
- 向我保證
- 好吧

761
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,459
你保證?

762
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:34,661
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

763
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:38,138
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

764
00:53:39,642 --> 00:53:43,635
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

765
00:53:43,712 --> 00:53:45,805
<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

766
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,654
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

767
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:02,730
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

768
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:07,701
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

769
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:09,864
<i>But I didn't.</i>

770
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:38,194
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

771
00:54:38,302 --> 00:54:40,362
Wanna finish her off?

772
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:46,801
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

773
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:50,279
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

774
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:53,614
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>

775
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:56,346
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

776
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:03,485
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

777
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,428
<i>I e-mailed them to everyone.</i>

778
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:08,624
Is that your blood?

779
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:12,395
Some of it, yeah.

780
00:55:12,505 --> 00:55:15,167
You can't smoke in here.

781
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,335
Take the rest of the day off.

782
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:19,935
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

783
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:22,139
Get yourself together.

784
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:24,848
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>

785
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:27,443
<i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>

786
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:29,613
<i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."</i>

787
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:31,588
<i>"I am enlightened."</i>

788
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:38,658
<i>You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

789
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:41,826
<i>move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,</i>

790
00:55:41,935 --> 00:55:45,803
<i>and you have to come home to this.</i>

791
00:55:56,451 --> 00:55:59,852
<i>- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>

792
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:04,186
<i>We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

793
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:05,556
Yes.

794
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:10,565
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

795
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:13,295
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>

796
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:15,392
No, I wasn't aware of that.

797
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,462
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

798
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,837
Does this sound strange to you?

799
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,776
<i>Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.</i>

800
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:24,870
<i>- The dynamite
- Dynamite?</i>

801
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,074
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

802
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:31,654
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?</i>

803
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,655
It means it was home-made.

804
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:37,989
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

805
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:43,624
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

806
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,794
<i>- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?</i>

807
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,929
<i>- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.</i>

808
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:53,476
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

809
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,637
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

810
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:58,647
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

811
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:03,210
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

812
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:05,551
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

813
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:07,716
especially material possessions.

814
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:10,692
<i>- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>

815
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,355
<i>- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.</i>

816
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:16,298
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

817
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:19,098
That condo was my life. OK?

818
00:57:19,238 --> 00:57:22,730
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

819
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:25,867
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

820
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:28,845
<i>- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>

821
00:57:28,914 --> 00:57:32,941
<i>- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>

822
00:57:33,051 --> 00:57:36,920
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

823
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:41,892
<i>- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>

824
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,954
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

825
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:48,465
<i>- OK?
- OK.</i>

826
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:55,767
<i>Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>

827
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:58,936
<i>My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.</i>

828
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:02,779
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

829
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:05,784
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

830
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:07,945
You... dance all night.

831
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:10,115
Then you throw it away.

832
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:12,985
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

833
00:58:14,528 --> 00:58:15,995
What?

834
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:23,633
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

835
00:58:23,738 --> 00:58:25,602
It was worth every penny.

836
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:27,766
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

837
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:34,038
某人只是在某一天珍愛它

838
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:36,242
Then tossed it.

839
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,178
Like a Christmas tree.

840
00:58:40,322 --> 00:58:42,415
So special.

841
00:58:42,525 --> 00:58:43,958
Then

842
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:45,823
bam!

843
00:58:45,928 --> 00:58:47,986
It's on the side of the road.

844
00:58:48,563 --> 00:58:50,657
Tinsel still clinging to it.

845
00:58:52,735 --> 00:58:54,794
Like a sex crime victim.

846
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,963
Underwear inside out.

847
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:01,474
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

848
00:59:01,577 --> 00:59:04,273
You can borrow it sometime.

849
00:59:11,287 --> 00:59:13,381
Get rid of her.

850
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:17,058
<i>- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.</i>

851
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,358
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

852
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:26,963
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

853
00:59:27,038 --> 00:59:31,667
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

854
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:36,712
Gotta get off

855
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,076
Thanks. Bye.

856
00:59:38,182 --> 00:59:44,121
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

857
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:48,724
Gonna get, need to get...

858
00:59:48,827 --> 00:59:50,852
Gotta get...

859
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:54,497
You kids!

860
00:59:56,502 --> 00:59:58,993
Why do you still waste time with her?

861
00:59:59,071 --> 01:00:01,403
I'll say this about Marla.

862
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,738
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>

863
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:05,139
And I'm not?

864
01:00:05,244 --> 01:00:08,077
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

865
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,240
What are we doing tonight?

866
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:13,147
Tonight... we make soap.

867
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,245
Really?

868
01:00:15,354 --> 01:00:18,188
To make soap, first we render fat.

869
01:00:37,077 --> 01:00:39,307
The salt balance has to be just right

870
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:41,938
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

871
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,844
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

872
01:00:53,928 --> 01:00:55,954
Pay dirt!

873
01:00:56,064 --> 01:00:59,897
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

874
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:09,068
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

875
01:01:13,682 --> 01:01:15,946
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

876
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,549
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

877
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:27,721
Like in Boy Scouts.

878
01:01:27,797 --> 01:01:31,598
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

879
01:01:33,936 --> 01:01:37,497
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

880
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,974
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

881
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:43,910
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

882
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,815
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

883
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,977
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

884
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:54,012
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

885
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:56,149
- You know why?
- No.

886
01:01:58,996 --> 01:02:02,797
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

887
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:06,063
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

888
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,605
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

889
01:02:08,673 --> 01:02:13,474
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

890
01:02:13,578 --> 01:02:15,637
May I see your hand, please?

891
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:24,251
What is this?

892
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:26,949
This is a chemical burn.

893
01:02:27,025 --> 01:02:30,553
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

894
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:33,257
<i>Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.</i>

895
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:36,830
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

896
01:02:37,636 --> 01:02:42,073
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

897
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:45,167
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

898
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:48,180
<i>I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.</i>

899
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:51,410
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

900
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,180
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

901
01:02:54,254 --> 01:02:58,281
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

902
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:02,384
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

903
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,260
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

904
01:03:09,337 --> 01:03:10,860
I am not!

905
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:13,929
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

906
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,204
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

907
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:23,445
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

908
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:27,647
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

909
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:31,284
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

910
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,328
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

911
01:03:34,428 --> 01:03:36,920
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

912
01:03:37,032 --> 01:03:41,526
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

913
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:46,163
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

914
01:03:46,275 --> 01:03:48,334
First, you have to give up.

915
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:54,239
首先, 你必須清楚, 而不是害怕
有朝一日, 你會死去

916
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:56,546
You don't know how this feels!

917
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,790
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

918
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:08,889
OK.

919
01:04:22,146 --> 01:04:24,171
Congratulations.

920
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:27,182
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

921
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,280
<i>Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>

922
01:04:33,357 --> 01:04:35,349
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

923
01:04:35,427 --> 01:04:38,691
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

924
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:40,821
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

925
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:44,800
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

926
01:04:45,804 --> 01:04:47,897
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

927
01:04:47,973 --> 01:04:50,237
<i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>

928
01:04:50,342 --> 01:04:53,971
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."

929
01:04:54,045 --> 01:04:57,607
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

930
01:04:57,717 --> 01:05:00,184
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

931
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:05,615
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

932
01:05:05,725 --> 01:05:08,159
You find this. What would you do?

933
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:14,789
Well, I gotta tell you,

934
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:18,530
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

935
01:05:18,637 --> 01:05:21,937
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

936
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:26,469
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

937
01:05:26,613 --> 01:05:29,446
and then stalk from office to office

938
01:05:29,549 --> 01:05:34,612
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

939
01:05:34,688 --> 01:05:39,148
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

940
01:05:39,826 --> 01:05:43,194
This might be someone
you've known for years.

941
01:05:43,264 --> 01:05:46,391
Someone very, very close to you.

942
01:05:46,466 --> 01:05:49,868
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

943
01:05:50,872 --> 01:05:52,965
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

944
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:56,374
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

945
01:06:00,214 --> 01:06:03,878
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

946
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,379
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

947
01:06:13,662 --> 01:06:17,290
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

948
01:06:17,398 --> 01:06:21,335
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

949
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:24,499
I don't know about this, Marla.

950
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:26,302
Please.

951
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:30,401
<i>She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.</i>

952
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:36,476
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

953
01:06:36,553 --> 01:06:38,680
Where are they, exactly?

954
01:06:38,755 --> 01:06:42,885
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

955
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:45,052
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

956
01:06:45,128 --> 01:06:47,221
Thanks for the thought.

957
01:06:48,566 --> 01:06:50,897
What happened to your hand?

958
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:53,128
Oh, nothing.

959
01:06:53,236 --> 01:06:55,296
Right there?

960
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,036
- Feel anything?
- No.

961
01:06:59,143 --> 01:07:01,133
Well, make sure.

962
01:07:01,244 --> 01:07:03,270
OK, I'm pretty sure.

963
01:07:03,347 --> 01:07:05,338
You feel nothing?

964
01:07:05,449 --> 01:07:07,747
No, nothing.

965
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:12,119
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

966
01:07:13,724 --> 01:07:16,922
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

967
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:19,088
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

968
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:22,656
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

969
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:24,860
Well, thanks, anyway.

970
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:32,174
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

971
01:07:32,278 --> 01:07:34,472
See you... around.

972
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:53,817
Cornelius?

973
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:56,257
Cornelius!

974
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,056
It's me! Bob!

975
01:07:59,163 --> 01:08:00,596
Hey, Bob.

976
01:08:04,169 --> 01:08:07,160
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

977
01:08:07,238 --> 01:08:11,266
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

978
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:14,868
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

979
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:18,711
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

980
01:08:19,384 --> 01:08:21,249
Well...

981
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,587
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

982
01:08:25,692 --> 01:08:27,819
And the second rule is

983
01:08:27,894 --> 01:08:30,192
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

984
01:08:30,263 --> 01:08:33,699
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

985
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:35,892
Look at my face, Bob.

986
01:08:38,305 --> 01:08:40,636
That's fucking... fucking great.

987
01:08:40,707 --> 01:08:44,438
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

988
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:48,243
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

989
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:51,014
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

990
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:53,713
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

991
01:08:53,854 --> 01:08:56,721
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

992
01:08:56,857 --> 01:09:00,453
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

993
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:03,929
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

994
01:09:04,031 --> 01:09:06,226
He's a great man.

995
01:09:07,702 --> 01:09:10,034
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

996
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:37,090
I didn't hurt you, did I?

997
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:39,259
Actually, you did.

998
01:09:39,335 --> 01:09:41,394
Thank you for this.

999
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:44,072
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1000
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:46,199
<i>Fight Club.</i>

1001
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:48,402
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

1002
01:09:48,611 --> 01:09:50,579
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

1003
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,014
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1004
01:09:55,619 --> 01:09:57,813
Shut up!

1005
01:09:57,954 --> 01:10:02,790
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1006
01:10:11,134 --> 01:10:15,196
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1007
01:10:15,306 --> 01:10:17,365
I see all this potential.

1008
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:19,534
And I see it squandered.

1009
01:10:20,545 --> 01:10:23,639
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1010
01:10:24,215 --> 01:10:26,308
Waiting tables.

1011
01:10:26,384 --> 01:10:28,444
Slaves with white collars.

1012
01:10:30,955 --> 01:10:34,015
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1013
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:37,391
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1014
01:10:41,265 --> 01:10:43,734
We're the middle children of history.

1015
01:10:43,802 --> 01:10:45,861
No purpose or place.

1016
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:48,164
We have no Great War.

1017
01:10:48,474 --> 01:10:50,568
No Great Depression.

1018
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:54,676
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1019
01:10:55,147 --> 01:10:58,481
Our great depression is our lives.

1020
01:11:01,354 --> 01:11:04,414
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1021
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:08,188
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1022
01:11:08,261 --> 01:11:10,354
But we won't.

1023
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:12,865
We're slowly learning that fact.

1024
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,433
And we're very, very pissed off.

1025
01:11:15,502 --> 01:11:17,163
Yeah!

1026
01:11:20,074 --> 01:11:24,510
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1027
01:11:30,017 --> 01:11:31,279
Who are you?

1028
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:34,714
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

1029
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:38,456
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1030
01:11:39,527 --> 01:11:43,430
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1031
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:45,591
Tyler Durden.

1032
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:52,196
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1033
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,640
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1034
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:57,304
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1035
01:11:57,412 --> 01:11:59,539
He don't own this place. I do.

1036
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:05,210
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1037
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:07,000
- 真的?
- 完全免費

1038
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,085
一毛不給嗎?

1039
01:12:08,156 --> 01:12:10,021
It is, actually.

1040
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,527
Look, stupid fuck!

1041
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:15,153
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1042
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,494
You should join our club.

1043
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:19,858
Did you hear what I just said?

1044
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:22,063
You and your friend.

1045
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,068
You hear me now?

1046
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:30,336
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1047
01:12:36,487 --> 01:12:38,478
Still not getting it.

1048
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,684
OK, OK, I got it.

1049
01:12:41,759 --> 01:12:44,250
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1050
01:12:45,295 --> 01:12:47,160
Back! All of you!

1051
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:50,926
Everybody back!

1052
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:00,570
Ah, Lou!

1053
01:13:00,678 --> 01:13:04,341
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1054
01:13:13,392 --> 01:13:16,326
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1055
01:13:16,427 --> 01:13:18,225
Oh, yeah!

1056
01:13:23,202 --> 01:13:25,295
Is that fucking funny?

1057
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:37,441
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1058
01:13:38,317 --> 01:13:39,979
Unbelievable.

1059
01:13:44,224 --> 01:13:47,193
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1060
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,161
You don't know where I've been!

1061
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:56,328
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1062
01:13:56,404 --> 01:13:58,837
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1063
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,807
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1064
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,867
On my mother's eyes.

1065
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,147
Thanks, Lou.

1066
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,551
You too, big guy.

1067
01:14:22,496 --> 01:14:24,590
We'll see you next week.

1068
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:43,677
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1069
01:14:43,785 --> 01:14:48,621
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1070
01:14:51,861 --> 01:14:54,022
You're gonna start a fight

1071
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,223
and you're gonna lose.

1072
01:14:58,201 --> 01:15:00,136
Excellent choice, sir.

1073
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:06,004
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1074
01:15:06,409 --> 01:15:09,038
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

1075
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:13,717
Son of a bitch!

1076
01:15:13,817 --> 01:15:18,550
<i>Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

1077
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,550
Excuse me!

1078
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,357
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1079
01:15:25,463 --> 01:15:27,362
Jay! Go call 911!

1080
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:32,160
Put the hose down.

1081
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,329
Stop it! Stop it!

1082
01:15:35,974 --> 01:15:37,874
Sorry.

1083
01:15:53,392 --> 01:15:55,860
We need to talk.

1084
01:15:58,097 --> 01:16:00,190
OK.

1085
01:16:00,299 --> 01:16:02,358
Where to begin?

1086
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:04,663
With your constant absenteeism?

1087
01:16:04,737 --> 01:16:07,298
With your unpresentable appearance?

1088
01:16:07,374 --> 01:16:09,399
You're up for review.

1089
01:16:09,508 --> 01:16:12,705
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1090
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:14,713
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1091
01:16:14,781 --> 01:16:17,682
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1092
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:25,582
有人通知你說這家公司汽車的
前座固定架沒有通過撞擊測試

1093
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:29,094
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1094
01:16:29,163 --> 01:16:33,599
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1095
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,566
What then?

1096
01:16:35,636 --> 01:16:37,934
Are you threatening me?

1097
01:16:38,006 --> 01:16:40,804
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1098
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:45,345
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1099
01:16:45,413 --> 01:16:47,506
In exchange for my salary,

1100
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:51,417
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1101
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,785
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1102
01:16:57,059 --> 01:17:01,189
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1103
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:09,995
<i>- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

1104
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:21,075
What the hell are you doing?

1105
01:17:30,293 --> 01:17:32,386
That hurt.

1106
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:35,890
Why would you do that?

1107
01:17:36,567 --> 01:17:39,558
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1108
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:51,006
What are you doing?

1109
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:54,176
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1110
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:58,382
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

1111
01:17:58,457 --> 01:18:00,048
No!

1114
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,683
Look.

1115
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:38,492
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1116
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:41,363
<i>Then, at our most excellent
moment together...</i>

1117
01:18:44,437 --> 01:18:47,167
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1118
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:49,367
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>

1120

<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

1121

<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

1122
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:08,587
<i>Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.</i>

1123
01:19:08,695 --> 01:19:12,154
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

1126
01:19:36,725 --> 01:19:38,784
Thank you, sir.

1127

- Yeah, I heard.

1131

There's one in Penns Grove too.

Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1133

- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1134
01:20:38,357 --> 01:20:40,848
No.

- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1140
01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:36,549
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1141
01:21:36,651 --> 01:21:38,675
Human sacrifice.

1142
01:21:38,752 --> 01:21:42,085
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

1143

- 很小, 狹窄的地下公寓
- 你怎麼知道的?

1151
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,144
因為爛公寓只有字母沒數字

1152

Raymond! You're going to die.

No!

1154

Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1155
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:21,526
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1156
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:25,158
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1158
01:22:29,272 --> 01:22:32,298
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1159
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:34,468
Were the midterms hard?

1160
01:22:35,612 --> 01:22:38,172
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1161

- Why?
- I don't know.

What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1163
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:50,226
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1164
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:53,988
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1165
01:22:54,098 --> 01:22:56,497
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1166
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,570
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1167
01:22:59,637 --> 01:23:02,197
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1168
01:23:02,306 --> 01:23:04,775
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1169
01:23:04,843 --> 01:23:09,302
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1170
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,007
Please, no.

1171
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,179
I'm keeping your license.

1172
01:23:18,423 --> 01:23:21,416
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1173
01:23:21,527 --> 01:23:24,519
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

1174
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,724
you will be dead.

1175
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,659
Now run on home.

01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:37,467
Run, Forrest, run!

1177
01:23:39,145 --> 01:23:41,204
I feel ill.

1178
01:23:42,015 --> 01:23:44,074
Imagine how he feels.

1179
01:23:44,184 --> 01:23:46,243
Come on, this isn't funny!

1180
01:23:46,352 --> 01:23:48,787
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1181
01:23:48,856 --> 01:23:52,985
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

His breakfast will taste better

<i>- Come on.
- He had a plan.</i>

1185
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:06,907
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.</i>

1186
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:08,907
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

1187

<i>處亂不驚的能力在於, 放任自然</i>

<i>You are not your job.</i>

1189
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:35,234
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1190
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,031
You're not the car you drive.

1191
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,409
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1192
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:44,810
You're not your fucking khakis.

1193
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:51,313
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1194
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:02,358
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1195
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,259
You don't have to go.

1196
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,862
Whatever.

1197
01:25:09,973 --> 01:25:13,067
No, I mean... It's OK.

1198
01:25:22,586 --> 01:25:24,714
Are you still going to groups?

1199
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,483
Yeah.

1200
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:31,052
Chloe's dead.

1201
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:33,520
Wow, Chloe.

1202
01:25:33,598 --> 01:25:35,532
When did that happen?

1203
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,965
Do you care?

1204
01:25:38,069 --> 01:25:41,402
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1205
01:25:41,706 --> 01:25:43,765
Yeah, well...

1206
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:46,208
It was the smart move on her part.

1207
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,605
Listen...

1208
01:25:50,915 --> 01:25:53,282
What are you getting out of all this?

1209
01:25:53,986 --> 01:25:56,079
What?

1210
01:25:56,188 --> 01:25:58,520
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1211
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,351
Is this making you happy?

1212
01:26:02,962 --> 01:26:05,021
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1213
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:08,893
I don't know. I don't understand.

1214
01:26:08,969 --> 01:26:12,530
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1215

What is... What is that?

1216
01:26:14,807 --> 01:26:16,969
What do you get out of it?

1217
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:20,538
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1218
01:26:20,614 --> 01:26:22,742
It's totally different with us.

1219
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:24,909
Us?

1220
01:26:24,985 --> 01:26:26,919
What do you mean by us?

1221
01:26:26,987 --> 01:26:30,856
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1222
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:32,983
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1223
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,789
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1224
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:38,627
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1225
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:42,202
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1226
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:45,535
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1227
01:26:45,607 --> 01:26:47,665
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1228
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,900
- 看著我
- 不, 什麼?

1229
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,208
看著我

1230
01:26:50,978 --> 01:26:53,812
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1231
01:26:53,882 --> 01:26:56,282
My God. Who did this?

1232
01:26:56,385 --> 01:26:58,443
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1233
01:26:58,552 --> 01:27:01,351
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1234
01:27:01,423 --> 01:27:04,017
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1235
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:06,083
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1236
01:27:06,194 --> 01:27:07,355
Let go of me!

1237
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:10,159
- This conversation
- This conversation

1238
01:27:10,232 --> 01:27:12,700
- is over.
- is over.

1239
01:27:13,568 --> 01:27:16,663
I just can't win with you, can I?

1240
01:27:26,015 --> 01:27:28,483
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1241
01:27:29,086 --> 01:27:31,417
What is... What is all this?

1242
01:27:31,487 --> 01:27:33,580
What do you think?

1243
01:27:34,524 --> 01:27:36,652
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1244
01:27:36,727 --> 01:27:38,592
Hey!

1245
01:27:45,436 --> 01:27:47,267
Too young.

1246
01:27:47,337 --> 01:27:48,998
Sorry.

1247
01:27:49,073 --> 01:27:51,133
What's all that?

1248
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:54,210
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1249
01:27:54,278 --> 01:27:56,906
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1250
01:27:57,014 --> 01:28:00,348
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1251
01:28:00,452 --> 01:28:02,511
he may enter and begin training.

1252
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:04,450
Training for what?

1253
01:28:10,061 --> 01:28:12,120
You think this is a game?

1254
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:14,892
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1255
01:28:14,966 --> 01:28:17,696
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1256
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,699
Bad news, friend.

1257
01:28:23,976 --> 01:28:26,068
It's not gonna happen.

1258
01:28:26,144 --> 01:28:28,443
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1259
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,448
It's not the end of the world.

1260
01:28:30,516 --> 01:28:32,711
Just... go away.

1261
01:28:33,586 --> 01:28:35,645
Go.

1262
01:28:35,721 --> 01:28:39,384
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1263
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,555
Don't you look at me!

1264
01:28:44,664 --> 01:28:47,928
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1265
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,368
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1266
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:54,998
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

1267
01:28:55,108 --> 01:28:57,941
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1268
01:29:05,486 --> 01:29:07,681
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1269
01:29:07,755 --> 01:29:10,018
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1270
01:29:10,123 --> 01:29:13,093
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1271
01:29:13,161 --> 01:29:15,220
- One blackjacket.
- Yes, sir.

1272
01:29:15,329 --> 01:29:18,321
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:22,560
All right.

1274
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,440
You're too old, fat man.

1275
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:37,713
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1276
01:29:45,527 --> 01:29:47,586
Bob! Bob!

1277
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,242
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1278
01:30:07,016 --> 01:30:08,483
Space monkey.

1279
01:30:08,585 --> 01:30:12,078
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1280
01:30:18,696 --> 01:30:21,392
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1281
01:30:21,465 --> 01:30:26,395
而你... 你太他媽白淨了!

1282
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:28,802
Get out of here, the both of you!

1283
01:30:28,873 --> 01:30:31,000
<i>And so it went.</i>

1284
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:33,269
Listen up, maggots.

1285
01:30:33,378 --> 01:30:35,437
You are not special.

1286
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,078
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1287
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:43,518
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1288
01:30:43,622 --> 01:30:45,715
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

1289
01:30:45,991 --> 01:30:49,620
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

1290
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,323
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

1291
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:57,631
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

1292
01:30:57,703 --> 01:30:59,795
<i>To what purpose?</i>

1293
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,306
<i>For what greater good?</i>

1294
01:31:05,645 --> 01:31:07,704
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

1295
01:31:13,052 --> 01:31:15,714
When he was like,
"You are not yourjob",

1296
01:31:15,821 --> 01:31:17,881
I was like, "Yeah!"

1297
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,852
Hey, what's all this?

1298
01:31:21,961 --> 01:31:24,055
Hey!

1299
01:31:25,532 --> 01:31:27,227
OK!

1300
01:31:27,301 --> 01:31:29,667
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1301
01:31:29,736 --> 01:31:32,261
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1302
01:31:36,276 --> 01:31:38,437
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1303
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:45,918
<i>The same great taste, Pepsi.</i>

1304
01:31:48,289 --> 01:31:50,519


1305
01:31:50,591 --> 01:31:54,391
<i>Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>

1306
01:31:54,495 --> 01:31:57,464
<i>Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?</i>

1307
01:31:57,532 --> 01:32:01,765
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>

1308
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:04,997
<i>somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.</i>

1309
01:32:05,106 --> 01:32:09,305
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

1310
01:32:10,212 --> 01:32:14,581
<i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene</i>

1311
01:32:14,683 --> 01:32:18,915
<i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.</i>

1312
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:20,818
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1313
01:32:20,923 --> 01:32:23,324
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1314
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:26,784
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1315
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:36,162
What the fuck did you guys do?

1316
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:40,335
<i>Arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

1317
01:32:44,114 --> 01:32:48,642
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1318
01:32:54,859 --> 01:32:59,554
打擊犯罪的鬥爭罪不能有拖延

1319
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:04,192
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1320
01:33:04,268 --> 01:33:09,206
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1321
01:33:09,274 --> 01:33:11,264
I gotta take a piss.

1322
01:33:11,375 --> 01:33:14,140
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1323
01:33:14,212 --> 01:33:16,806
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1324
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:18,975
Bob.

1325
01:33:22,087 --> 01:33:27,686
"希望"計劃需要警察與
社區領導的共同的努力

1326
01:33:27,793 --> 01:33:31,957
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1327
01:34:17,411 --> 01:34:21,542
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1328
01:34:23,551 --> 01:34:26,883
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1329
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:30,322
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

1330
01:34:30,425 --> 01:34:32,723
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1331
01:34:33,628 --> 01:34:37,429
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.</i>

1332
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,262
Look.

1333
01:34:39,334 --> 01:34:42,429
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1334
01:34:42,505 --> 01:34:46,066
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1335
01:34:46,175 --> 01:34:49,906
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1336
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:57,149
Do not fuck with us.

1337
01:35:04,561 --> 01:35:06,688
Ball check!

1338
01:35:21,012 --> 01:35:23,104
Bob, you're this way.

1339
01:35:24,214 --> 01:35:26,547
Let's go.

1340
01:35:26,617 --> 01:35:29,814
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

1341
01:35:30,922 --> 01:35:32,980
Hey!

1342
01:35:47,505 --> 01:35:48,768
Yeah!

1343
01:36:21,541 --> 01:36:24,339
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>

1344
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:28,278
<i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

1345
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:36,154
<i>我想要打開油箱的閥門
淹沒我從沒見過的法國海灘</i>

1346
01:36:39,425 --> 01:36:41,894
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

1347
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:01,407
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1348
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:06,053
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1349
01:37:09,592 --> 01:37:11,650
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1350
01:37:11,726 --> 01:37:13,819
Yeah.

1351
01:37:24,607 --> 01:37:27,667
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1352
01:37:29,145 --> 01:37:31,273
After you, Mr Durden.

1353
01:37:32,215 --> 01:37:34,307
After you.

1354
01:37:52,069 --> 01:37:54,664
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1355
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:57,969
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1356
01:37:58,075 --> 01:38:01,068
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1357
01:38:01,145 --> 01:38:03,545
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1358
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:08,847
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1359
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:13,323
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1360
01:38:13,391 --> 01:38:17,000
- 這是你和我的?
- 對, 不是我們一起創立的嗎?

1361
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:17,657
你理解錯了

1362
01:38:17,729 --> 01:38:21,165
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1363
01:38:21,265 --> 01:38:23,700
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1364
01:38:24,536 --> 01:38:26,527
Hey, Tyler!

1365
01:38:28,373 --> 01:38:30,865
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1366
01:38:30,943 --> 01:38:33,411
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

1367
01:38:33,512 --> 01:38:36,140
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1368
01:38:36,215 --> 01:38:38,911
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1369
01:38:38,984 --> 01:38:41,612
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1370
01:38:43,389 --> 01:38:47,121
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1371
01:38:47,193 --> 01:38:50,684
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1372
01:38:50,763 --> 01:38:52,823
and especially about you and me.

1373
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,161
What is that supposed to mean?

1374
01:38:59,573 --> 01:39:01,733
What are you doing?

1375
01:39:02,642 --> 01:39:05,372
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1376
01:39:05,445 --> 01:39:08,313
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1377
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:10,782
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1378
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:13,250
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1379
01:39:13,386 --> 01:39:16,413
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1380
01:39:16,524 --> 01:39:20,153
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

1381
01:39:20,227 --> 01:39:22,560
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1382
01:39:22,631 --> 01:39:25,064
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1383
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,597
Jesus Christ!

1384
01:39:29,337 --> 01:39:31,430
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1385
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,599
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1386
01:39:33,675 --> 01:39:36,337
I am sick of all your shit!

1387
01:39:36,445 --> 01:39:38,345
OK, man.

1388
01:39:40,148 --> 01:39:42,673
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1389
01:39:42,784 --> 01:39:45,548
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1390
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:50,752
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1391
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,884
What?

1392
01:39:52,995 --> 01:39:56,896
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

1393
01:39:56,998 --> 01:40:00,696
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1394
01:40:02,438 --> 01:40:04,269
Let go!

1395
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:06,467
All right. Fine.

1396
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:09,244
Fine.

1397
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,108
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

1398
01:41:10,175 --> 01:41:16,909
<i>在我填寫事故報告前
那些人一定就是這種感受吧</i>

1399
01:41:16,982 --> 01:41:19,076
Goddamn!

1400
01:41:22,589 --> 01:41:25,751
We've just had a near-life experience!

1401
01:41:29,596 --> 01:41:31,587
In the world I see,

1402
01:41:31,698 --> 01:41:38,661
你在大峽谷叢林和洛克菲勒中心的廢墟中徘徊

1403
01:41:40,674 --> 01:41:45,009
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1404
01:41:45,112 --> 01:41:49,674
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1405
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,312
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1406
01:41:54,388 --> 01:42:00,323
在荒廢的停車道上曬鹿皮

1407
01:42:13,775 --> 01:42:16,005
Feel better, champ.

1408
01:42:33,363 --> 01:42:35,160
<i>And then...</i>

1409
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:36,789
Tyler?

1410
01:42:36,866 --> 01:42:38,959
<i>..Tyler was gone.</i>

1411
01:42:46,342 --> 01:42:48,368
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

1412
01:42:49,446 --> 01:42:51,470
<i>Had I slept?</i>

1413
01:42:51,614 --> 01:42:54,641
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1414
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,186
<i>The house had become a living thing.</i>

1415
01:42:57,254 --> 01:43:01,885
<i>Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

1416
01:43:02,393 --> 01:43:04,987
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

1417
01:43:07,865 --> 01:43:09,959
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

1418
01:43:10,035 --> 01:43:12,094
<i>I had to hug the walls.</i>

1419
01:43:12,203 --> 01:43:15,296
<i>Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

1420
01:43:15,406 --> 01:43:19,207
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1421
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:21,802
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>

1422
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:26,108
Hang on a second.

1423
01:43:45,037 --> 01:43:47,733
It's under control, sir.

1424
01:43:48,309 --> 01:43:50,000
（特魯裏街）

1425
01:43:50,209 --> 01:43:52,040
Where's Tyler?

1426
01:43:52,111 --> 01:43:55,104
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1427
01:43:55,215 --> 01:43:57,148
Right... OK.

1428
01:43:59,552 --> 01:44:01,680
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1429
01:44:01,855 --> 01:44:05,484
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

1430
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:07,856
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

1431
01:44:12,065 --> 01:44:15,866
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

1432
01:44:16,771 --> 01:44:19,967
<i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>

1433
01:44:22,777 --> 01:44:25,473
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1434
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,939
Who are all these people?

1435
01:44:33,187 --> 01:44:35,485
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1436
01:44:37,058 --> 01:44:39,118
Can I come in?

1437
01:44:42,263 --> 01:44:44,322
He's not here.

1438
01:44:44,398 --> 01:44:46,663
What?

1439
01:44:47,703 --> 01:44:51,264
Tyler isn't here.

1440
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,399
Tyler went away.

1441
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:55,935
Tyler's gone.

1442
01:45:12,962 --> 01:45:14,691
Get some help!

1443
01:45:25,842 --> 01:45:30,746
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1444
01:45:30,815 --> 01:45:33,215
What happened? What happened?

1445
01:45:33,317 --> 01:45:36,184
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1446
01:45:37,454 --> 01:45:39,547
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1447
01:45:39,623 --> 01:45:42,148
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1448
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:46,024
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1449
01:45:52,437 --> 01:45:54,803
We had it all worked out, sir.

1450
01:46:02,981 --> 01:46:06,247
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1451
01:46:06,352 --> 01:46:09,081
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1452
01:46:10,589 --> 01:46:13,024
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1453
01:46:18,397 --> 01:46:20,422
Oh, God!

1454
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:23,798
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1455
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:28,001
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1456
01:46:28,075 --> 01:46:30,770
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1457
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:36,881
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1458
01:46:36,984 --> 01:46:39,851
- Bury him.
- What?

1459
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,184
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1460
01:46:42,256 --> 01:46:45,123
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1461
01:46:45,225 --> 01:46:48,456
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1462
01:46:48,528 --> 01:46:51,123
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1463
01:46:51,232 --> 01:46:54,428
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1464
01:46:54,501 --> 01:46:57,494
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1465
01:46:57,605 --> 01:46:59,630
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1466
01:46:59,707 --> 01:47:01,834
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1467
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:03,900
Now, you listen to me.

1468
01:47:04,011 --> 01:47:08,506
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1469
01:47:08,616 --> 01:47:10,516
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

1470
01:47:10,618 --> 01:47:13,452
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1471
01:47:14,123 --> 01:47:16,420
I understand.

1472
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:22,028
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

1473
01:47:22,097 --> 01:47:24,156
has a name.

1474
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:27,235
<i>His name is Robert Paulsen.</i>

1475
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:29,763
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1476
01:47:30,539 --> 01:47:33,235
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1477
01:47:33,309 --> 01:47:37,143
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1478
01:47:37,246 --> 01:47:40,306
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1479
01:47:40,382 --> 01:47:42,977
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1480
01:47:43,086 --> 01:47:46,146
Shut up! This is all over with!

1481
01:47:49,392 --> 01:47:51,917
Get the fuck out of here.

1482
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:15,950
（洛杉磯往芝加哥）

1483
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,950
（達拉斯往亞特蘭大）

1484
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,200
（泰勒·德頓）

1485
01:48:20,624 --> 01:48:25,085
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1486
01:48:25,163 --> 01:48:26,721
I need to see you...

1487
01:48:31,236 --> 01:48:35,297
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>

1488
01:48:35,374 --> 01:48:40,142
<i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>

1489
01:48:40,213 --> 01:48:44,774
<i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>

1490
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:48,951
我愛莫能助, 長官

1491
01:48:54,226 --> 01:48:56,320
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

1492
01:48:57,363 --> 01:48:59,763
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>

1493
01:49:00,366 --> 01:49:02,631
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

1494
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:04,396
Hey! Hey!

1495
01:49:05,471 --> 01:49:07,063
Taxi!

1496
01:49:07,173 --> 01:49:09,233
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1497
01:49:09,343 --> 01:49:11,868
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1498
01:49:11,979 --> 01:49:15,641
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

1499
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:20,448
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

1500
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:24,819
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1501
01:49:26,194 --> 01:49:31,222
<i>Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

1502
01:49:34,002 --> 01:49:38,439
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

1503
01:49:38,506 --> 01:49:40,770
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

1504
01:49:42,177 --> 01:49:45,237
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1505
01:49:45,313 --> 01:49:49,579
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1506
01:49:49,651 --> 01:49:52,677
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1507
01:49:52,787 --> 01:49:56,849
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?

1508
01:49:56,992 --> 01:49:59,983
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual d矇j? vu.</i>

1509
01:50:00,796 --> 01:50:02,855
<i>Everywhere I went,</i>

1510
01:50:02,998 --> 01:50:04,932
<i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>

1511
01:50:05,034 --> 01:50:07,936
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

1512
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:11,097
<i>The smell of dried blood,</i>

1513
01:50:11,207 --> 01:50:14,699
<i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

1514
01:50:15,545 --> 01:50:18,742
<i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>

1515
01:50:18,849 --> 01:50:22,409
<i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

1516
01:50:23,286 --> 01:50:26,221
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

1517
01:50:29,126 --> 01:50:32,254
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1518
01:50:36,867 --> 01:50:38,961
Welcome back, sir.

1519
01:50:39,937 --> 01:50:42,030
How have you been?

1520
01:50:42,106 --> 01:50:44,266
Do you know me?

1521
01:50:44,341 --> 01:50:46,742
Is this a test, sir?

1522
01:50:46,844 --> 01:50:48,709
No. This is not a test.

1523
01:50:48,779 --> 01:50:51,043
You were in here last Thursday.

1524
01:50:51,582 --> 01:50:53,881
Thursday?

1525
01:50:53,985 --> 01:50:57,944
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1526
01:50:58,589 --> 01:51:00,683
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1527
01:51:03,362 --> 01:51:05,522
Who do you think I am?

1528
01:51:05,596 --> 01:51:08,157
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1529
01:51:08,267 --> 01:51:10,167
No, this is not a test.

1530
01:51:10,269 --> 01:51:12,328
You're Mr Durden.

1531
01:51:13,672 --> 01:51:16,334
You're the one who gave me this.

1532
01:51:16,408 --> 01:51:20,606
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

1533
01:51:32,091 --> 01:51:34,150
<i>- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.</i>

1534
01:51:34,227 --> 01:51:36,196
<i>- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?</i>

1535
01:51:36,297 --> 01:51:37,628
Had sex?

1536
01:51:37,731 --> 01:51:39,891
What kind of stupid question is that?

1537
01:51:39,999 --> 01:51:42,365
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1538
01:51:42,435 --> 01:51:45,030
<i>- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...</i>

1539
01:51:45,139 --> 01:51:49,006
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1540
01:51:49,108 --> 01:51:52,510
<i>- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?</i>

1541
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,413
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1542
01:51:55,516 --> 01:51:58,418
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1543
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:01,386
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1544
01:52:01,455 --> 01:52:04,151
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1545
01:52:04,225 --> 01:52:06,319
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>

1546
01:52:06,394 --> 01:52:07,861
What did you just say?

1547
01:52:07,963 --> 01:52:10,329
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1548
01:52:10,398 --> 01:52:14,061
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1549
01:52:14,169 --> 01:52:16,228
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1550
01:52:16,338 --> 01:52:19,136
You broke your promise.

1551
01:52:19,207 --> 01:52:21,176
Jesus, Tyler.

1552
01:52:21,244 --> 01:52:24,679
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1553
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:28,238
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1554
01:52:28,351 --> 01:52:30,649
Why do people think that I'm you?

1555
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:33,278
Answer me!

1556
01:52:35,658 --> 01:52:37,489
Sit.

1557
01:52:40,296 --> 01:52:42,993
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1558
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:45,260
I think you know.

1559
01:52:45,401 --> 01:52:47,961
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1560
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:50,801
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1561
01:52:50,874 --> 01:52:53,672
I... I don't know.

1562
01:52:58,448 --> 01:53:01,315
- You got it.
- No.

1563
01:53:01,418 --> 01:53:03,511
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1564
01:53:04,889 --> 01:53:06,913
Because...

1565
01:53:08,292 --> 01:53:09,452
Say it!

1566
01:53:11,128 --> 01:53:13,188
Because we're the same person.

1567
01:53:13,264 --> 01:53:15,391
That's right.

1568
01:53:15,466 --> 01:53:17,626
<i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.</i>

1569
01:53:17,701 --> 01:53:21,433
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1570
01:53:21,506 --> 01:53:23,599
You could not do this on your own.

1571
01:53:23,675 --> 01:53:25,734
All the ways you wish you could be,

1572
01:53:25,843 --> 01:53:27,708
that's me.

1573
01:53:27,812 --> 01:53:30,940
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1574
01:53:31,049 --> 01:53:33,415
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1575
01:53:33,484 --> 01:53:36,249
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1576
01:53:36,322 --> 01:53:37,311
Oh, no.

1577
01:53:37,423 --> 01:53:40,323
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1578
01:53:40,425 --> 01:53:42,724
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1579
01:53:42,828 --> 01:53:44,853
People do it every day.

1580
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:48,492
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1581
01:53:48,568 --> 01:53:51,832
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1582
01:53:55,642 --> 01:53:58,975
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1583
01:53:59,112 --> 01:54:03,776
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1584
01:54:03,883 --> 01:54:06,374
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1585
01:54:06,486 --> 01:54:10,856
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

1586
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:13,591
Tyler Durden.

1587
01:54:13,693 --> 01:54:16,491
You are not yourjob
or how much money you have!

1588
01:54:16,563 --> 01:54:18,964
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1589
01:54:19,066 --> 01:54:22,694
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1590
01:54:22,769 --> 01:54:24,566
Or you stay up and make soap.

1591
01:54:24,671 --> 01:54:29,609
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.

1592
01:54:31,345 --> 01:54:33,371
Oh, my God.

1593
01:54:34,382 --> 01:54:36,475
Now you see our dilemma.

1594
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:38,814
She knows too much.

1595
01:54:38,919 --> 01:54:44,017
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1596
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,285
What... What are you saying?

1597
01:54:47,229 --> 01:54:51,495
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

1598
01:54:51,566 --> 01:54:54,228
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1599
01:54:54,337 --> 01:54:57,032
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1600
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:00,735
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

1601
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:02,903
<i>The movie goes on</i>

1602
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:06,107
<i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

1603
01:55:19,061 --> 01:55:22,758
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1604
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:25,267
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1605
01:55:29,672 --> 01:55:33,734
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1606
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:43,679
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?</i>

1607
01:55:43,787 --> 01:55:48,657
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

1608
01:55:51,161 --> 01:55:53,596
Is anybody here?

1609
01:55:56,267 --> 01:55:58,360
<i>D矇j? vu all over again.</i>

1610
01:56:00,004 --> 01:56:02,495
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1611
01:56:04,843 --> 01:56:06,902
Oh, my God.

1612
01:56:10,816 --> 01:56:13,181
<i>- 1888.
- Who am I calling?</i>

1613
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:17,282
<i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?</i>

1614
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,049
（富蘭克林街, 1888號）

1615
01:56:18,457 --> 01:56:20,049
<i>Hello?</i>

1616
01:56:20,125 --> 01:56:22,252
1888 Franklin Street?

1617
01:56:22,328 --> 01:56:24,421
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

1618
01:56:26,866 --> 01:56:29,460
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1619
01:56:29,535 --> 01:56:32,061
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1620
01:56:32,138 --> 01:56:34,264
<i>- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.</i>

1621
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:37,504
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1622
01:56:37,611 --> 01:56:39,670
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

1623
01:56:40,113 --> 01:56:43,674
<i>- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>

1624
01:56:47,921 --> 01:56:49,286
<i>2160.</i>

1625
01:56:49,286 --> 01:56:50,286
（富爾頓道, 2160號）

1626
01:56:56,897 --> 01:56:59,423
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1627
01:57:01,102 --> 01:57:03,900
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1628
01:57:03,971 --> 01:57:08,135
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1629
01:57:08,276 --> 01:57:10,972
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1630
01:57:11,078 --> 01:57:15,038
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1631
01:57:15,117 --> 01:57:19,075
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1632
01:57:22,324 --> 01:57:24,884
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1633
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,087
You have every right to be...

1634
01:57:27,696 --> 01:57:29,561
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1635
01:57:29,665 --> 01:57:32,600
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1636
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:34,726
Why is it free of charge?

1637
01:57:34,803 --> 01:57:36,863
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1638
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:42,468
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1639
01:57:42,544 --> 01:57:44,604
Clean food, please.

1640
01:57:44,714 --> 01:57:47,740
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

1641
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:49,910
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1642
01:57:51,387 --> 01:57:53,617
You got about 30 seconds.

1643
01:57:56,326 --> 01:57:58,818
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1644
01:57:58,929 --> 01:58:02,364
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1645
01:58:02,432 --> 01:58:07,496
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

1646
01:58:07,571 --> 01:58:11,632
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1647
01:58:11,742 --> 01:58:14,108
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1648
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:16,772
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1649
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:19,577
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1650
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:21,949
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1651
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:24,112
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1652
01:58:24,188 --> 01:58:28,523
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1653
01:58:28,593 --> 01:58:30,720
You do?

1654
01:58:30,795 --> 01:58:32,660
I really do.

1655
01:58:32,764 --> 01:58:37,064
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1656
01:58:37,168 --> 01:58:39,932
Marla, your life is in danger.

1657
01:58:40,005 --> 01:58:41,939
What?

1658
01:58:42,007 --> 01:58:45,738
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1659
01:58:45,810 --> 01:58:48,608
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1660
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:52,139
- No. I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1661
01:58:52,218 --> 01:58:54,778
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1662
01:58:56,589 --> 01:59:01,026
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1663
01:59:01,093 --> 01:59:04,154
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

1664
01:59:04,231 --> 01:59:06,199
You're spectacular in bed.

1665
01:59:06,266 --> 01:59:07,698
But

1666
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,859
you're intolerable.

1667
01:59:09,969 --> 01:59:12,461
You have very serious emotional problems.

1668
01:59:12,572 --> 01:59:16,508
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1669
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:20,569
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1670
01:59:21,715 --> 01:59:23,808
I can't do this any more.

1671
01:59:23,884 --> 01:59:25,977
I can't.

1672
01:59:26,053 --> 01:59:28,113
And I won't.

1673
01:59:28,222 --> 01:59:30,246
I'm gone.

1674
01:59:30,323 --> 01:59:33,019
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1675
01:59:35,863 --> 01:59:38,525
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1676
01:59:38,633 --> 01:59:41,124
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1677
01:59:41,235 --> 01:59:44,227
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1678
01:59:44,305 --> 01:59:46,432
Here, wait right here!

1679
01:59:50,312 --> 01:59:52,871
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1680
01:59:52,947 --> 01:59:55,074
Take this money and get on this bus.

1681
01:59:55,149 --> 01:59:57,311
I promise I won't bother you again.

1682
01:59:57,453 --> 01:59:58,886
Shut up!

1683
01:59:58,954 --> 02:00:02,151
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1684
02:00:03,325 --> 02:00:05,452
Why are you doing this?

1685
02:00:05,527 --> 02:00:09,000
他們認為你是某種威脅
我解釋不清, 相信我就是了

1686
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:14,067
- 如果我知道你去哪, 你就不安全了
- 我不會還這些錢的, 當作分手費好了

1687
02:00:14,136 --> 02:00:18,540
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1688
02:00:20,076 --> 02:00:22,909
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1689
02:00:37,927 --> 02:00:40,590
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1690
02:00:40,698 --> 02:00:43,462
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1691
02:00:43,534 --> 02:00:48,494
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1692
02:00:48,572 --> 02:00:52,474
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1693
02:00:52,543 --> 02:00:56,344
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1694
02:00:56,515 --> 02:00:59,540
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1695
02:00:59,617 --> 02:01:05,215
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1696
02:01:05,323 --> 02:01:09,191
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1697
02:01:09,294 --> 02:01:11,194
That's our headquarters.

1698
02:01:11,296 --> 02:01:13,890
In the back, buried in the garden,

1699
02:01:13,965 --> 02:01:16,992
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1700
02:01:17,103 --> 02:01:20,401
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

1701
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:25,842
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1702
02:01:25,945 --> 02:01:33,310
我相信他們的計劃是炸毀
這些信用卡公司的總部和TWR大廈

1703
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:37,620
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1704
02:01:37,723 --> 02:01:41,318
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1705
02:01:42,161 --> 02:01:44,220
You'll create total chaos.

1706
02:01:45,833 --> 02:01:49,064
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

1707
02:01:59,646 --> 02:02:01,877
I really admire what you're doing.

1708
02:02:02,350 --> 02:02:04,408
What?

1709
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:06,576
You're a brave man to order this.

1710
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,417
You're a genius, sir.

1711
02:02:08,556 --> 02:02:13,255
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1712
02:02:13,361 --> 02:02:15,693
we gotta get his balls.

1713
02:02:17,098 --> 02:02:20,261
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1714
02:02:20,368 --> 02:02:23,395
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1715
02:02:23,472 --> 02:02:26,304
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1716
02:02:26,407 --> 02:02:30,276
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1717
02:02:30,379 --> 02:02:33,075
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1718
02:02:33,182 --> 02:02:37,312
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1719
02:02:43,459 --> 02:02:47,021
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1720
02:02:47,863 --> 02:02:49,922
Is somebody timing this?

1721
02:02:50,099 --> 02:02:53,069
Keep your mouth shut.

1722
02:02:53,136 --> 02:02:55,229
Shit!

1723
02:02:57,874 --> 02:03:00,672
Some of this information checks out.

1724
02:03:00,744 --> 02:03:04,043
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1725
02:03:04,748 --> 02:03:06,512
Hey, wait!

1726
02:03:07,218 --> 02:03:09,742
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1727
02:03:09,853 --> 02:03:12,321
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1728
02:03:12,422 --> 02:03:14,914
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1729
02:03:18,462 --> 02:03:21,898
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1730
02:03:23,134 --> 02:03:25,159
Get down on the floor!

1731
02:03:29,942 --> 02:03:34,878
誰他媽的敢出來
我就崩了他, 明白嗎?

1732
02:03:59,205 --> 02:04:01,799
Get away! Stay away!

1733
02:04:14,755 --> 02:04:16,813
<i>I ran.</i>

1734
02:04:17,357 --> 02:04:21,522
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

1735
02:04:24,164 --> 02:04:26,222
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

1736
02:04:31,164 --> 02:04:32,700
（富蘭克林街）

1737
02:05:06,942 --> 02:05:09,240
What the fuck are you doing?

1738
02:05:09,345 --> 02:05:12,280
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1739
02:05:12,381 --> 02:05:15,475
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1740
02:05:15,584 --> 02:05:20,488
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1741
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:42,900
（停車場電梯）

1742
02:06:08,473 --> 02:06:11,136
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1743
02:06:11,243 --> 02:06:14,610
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1744
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:18,081
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1745
02:06:18,150 --> 02:06:21,415
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1746
02:06:21,487 --> 02:06:23,853
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1747
02:06:23,922 --> 02:06:25,914
The buildings are empty.

1748
02:06:26,025 --> 02:06:28,857
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1749
02:06:28,927 --> 02:06:31,691
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1750
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:35,164
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

1751
02:06:35,268 --> 02:06:38,862
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1752
02:06:44,911 --> 02:06:49,280
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1753
02:06:49,349 --> 02:06:51,078
If you know, I know.

1754
02:06:56,690 --> 02:07:01,058
<i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>

1755
02:07:09,571 --> 02:07:10,662
You think?

1756
02:07:12,673 --> 02:07:14,766
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1757
02:07:15,609 --> 02:07:18,602
Pull any one but the green one.

1758
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:25,979
I asked you not to do that!

1759
02:07:27,822 --> 02:07:29,380
Fuck!

1760
02:07:30,325 --> 02:07:32,418
Tyler, get away from the van.

1761
02:07:34,629 --> 02:07:38,030
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1762
02:07:38,133 --> 02:07:39,499
Goddamn it!

1763
02:07:45,841 --> 02:07:47,206
OK.

1764
02:07:47,310 --> 02:07:50,643
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1765
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:53,341
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1766
02:07:55,551 --> 02:07:57,314
Cool it, Tyler!

1767
02:08:10,534 --> 02:08:12,593
Come on!

1768
02:08:12,669 --> 02:08:14,728
Don't go!

1769
02:08:52,311 --> 02:08:53,505
What?!

1770
02:09:38,993 --> 02:09:39,687
Three minutes.

1771
02:09:40,628 --> 02:09:42,926
This is it.

1772
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:45,055
The beginning.

1773
02:09:45,132 --> 02:09:47,100
Ground zero.

1774
02:09:47,168 --> 02:09:49,466
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>

1775
02:09:49,537 --> 02:09:52,029
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1776
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,132
你說什麼?

1777
02:09:55,242 --> 02:09:57,301
I still can't think of anything.

1778
02:09:59,348 --> 02:10:01,441
Flashback humor.

1779
02:10:06,521 --> 02:10:08,546
It's getting exciting now.

1780
02:10:10,125 --> 02:10:11,922
Two and a half.

1781
02:10:11,993 --> 02:10:14,554
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1782
02:10:14,664 --> 02:10:19,464
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1783
02:10:19,534 --> 02:10:23,266
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1784
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:39,219
Why is she here?

1785
02:10:39,322 --> 02:10:41,222
Tying up loose ends.

1786
02:10:41,324 --> 02:10:44,385
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1787
02:10:44,495 --> 02:10:47,589
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

1788
02:10:47,698 --> 02:10:51,156
<i>- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.</i>

1789
02:10:51,235 --> 02:10:55,968
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1790
02:10:56,039 --> 02:11:00,033
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1791
02:11:00,145 --> 02:11:02,203
You're a voice in mine!

1792
02:11:02,312 --> 02:11:05,146
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1793
02:11:05,216 --> 02:11:07,309
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1794
02:11:07,385 --> 02:11:11,652
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1795
02:11:11,757 --> 02:11:15,715
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

1796
02:11:15,827 --> 02:11:17,556
and I accept that.

1797
02:11:17,629 --> 02:11:21,657
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1798
02:11:23,668 --> 02:11:25,863
Have I ever let us down?

1799
02:11:27,339 --> 02:11:29,637
How far have you come because of me?!

1800
02:11:35,548 --> 02:11:37,607
I will bring us through this.

1801
02:11:37,683 --> 02:11:41,484
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

1802
02:11:41,588 --> 02:11:44,022
and in the end you will thank me.

1803
02:11:44,491 --> 02:11:47,015
Tyler. Tyler.

1804
02:11:47,092 --> 02:11:50,620
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1805
02:11:50,697 --> 02:11:53,393
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1806
02:11:53,467 --> 02:11:58,769
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1807
02:11:58,839 --> 02:12:00,898
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1808
02:12:01,775 --> 02:12:05,610
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1809
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:07,306
60 seconds till CRI.

1810
02:12:07,848 --> 02:12:09,907
No.

1811
02:12:11,819 --> 02:12:14,617
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1812
02:12:14,689 --> 02:12:18,386
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1813
02:12:19,861 --> 02:12:21,920
The gun's in my hand.

1814
02:12:26,935 --> 02:12:29,425
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1815
02:12:38,313 --> 02:12:40,941
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1816
02:12:41,083 --> 02:12:43,142
Not my head, Tyler.

1817
02:12:43,719 --> 02:12:45,744
Our head.

1818
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:49,349
Interesting.

1819
02:12:52,361 --> 02:12:55,024
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1820
02:13:01,503 --> 02:13:04,496
Hey. It's you and me.

1821
02:13:07,243 --> 02:13:09,303
Friends?

1822
02:13:10,147 --> 02:13:12,240
Tyler,

1823
02:13:15,652 --> 02:13:17,985
I want you to really listen to me.

1824
02:13:18,122 --> 02:13:20,556
OK.

1825
02:13:20,658 --> 02:13:22,717
My eyes are open.

1826
02:13:41,479 --> 02:13:43,504
What's that smell?

1827
02:14:03,135 --> 02:14:06,127
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1828
02:14:06,772 --> 02:14:08,364
Mr Durden!

1829
02:14:09,442 --> 02:14:11,307
Oh, my God!

1830
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:19,846
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1831
02:14:19,952 --> 02:14:23,912
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1832
02:14:23,991 --> 02:14:27,984
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1833
02:14:28,061 --> 02:14:30,825
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1834
02:14:30,964 --> 02:14:34,559
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1835
02:14:36,837 --> 02:14:39,068
Stop it!

1836
02:14:39,207 --> 02:14:42,334
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1837
02:14:42,409 --> 02:14:44,206
You!

1838
02:14:44,277 --> 02:14:46,371
Hi, Marla.

1839
02:14:46,848 --> 02:14:51,682
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1840
02:14:51,786 --> 02:14:53,845
Yes, I'm sure.

1841
02:14:54,956 --> 02:14:59,052
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

1842
02:14:59,194 --> 02:15:01,856
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

1843
02:15:01,964 --> 02:15:03,453
Yeah, I know.

1844
02:15:08,237 --> 02:15:10,102
What happened?

1845
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:12,366
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

1846
02:15:12,441 --> 02:15:14,500
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

1847
02:15:15,444 --> 02:15:18,470
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

1848
02:15:22,285 --> 02:15:24,116
Who did this?

1849
02:15:24,253 --> 02:15:26,721
I did, actually.

1850
02:15:26,822 --> 02:15:28,882
Find some gauze.

1851
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:32,285
You shot yourself?

1852
02:15:32,395 --> 02:15:35,023
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1853
02:15:35,098 --> 02:15:37,396
I'm really OK.

1854
02:15:37,467 --> 02:15:41,426
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1855
02:15:54,251 --> 02:15:58,119
You met me at a very strange time in my life.

1856
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:07,838
<i>總是有人問我認不認識泰勒·德頓</i>

1857
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:09,806
三分鐘之後

1858
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,215
就是這樣, 一切清零

1859
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:15,983
想說點什麼來紀念這個時刻嗎?

1860
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:19,617
<i>嘴裏含著槍管, 我只能吱吱唔唔</i>

1861
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:21,785
我什麼也想不出

1862
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:25,730
<i>剎那間, 我忘了泰勒的爆破行動</i>

1863
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,993
<i>只想知道那把槍到底有多髒</i>

1864
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:30,127
越來越刺激了

1865
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:33,400
<i>常言道, 人們總是傷害他們所愛的人</i>

1866
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,600
<i>如今, 反之亦然</i>

1867
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:39,942
<i>我們坐在前排觀賞
這場大規模爆破表演</i>

1868
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,811
<i>"暴動"計劃爆破行動組</i>

1869
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:46,320
<i>把甘油炸藥裝在
12幢建築的地基上</i>

1870
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:50,489
<i>兩分鐘之後, 炸彈將被接連引爆</i>

1871
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:53,926
<i>這幾片街區將隨之
化為燃燒的廢墟</i>

1872
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:57,055
<i>我知道這些, 因為泰勒知道這些</i>

1873
00:02:57,132 --> 00:03:00,534
還有兩分半鍾, 想想我們的所有成就吧

1874
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:05,971
<i>突然間, 我意識到這所有的一切
那把槍, 那些炸彈, 這場革命...</i>

1875
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:09,340
<i>都跟一個叫瑪拉·辛格的女人有關</i>

1876
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,246
<i>鮑伯, 鮑伯長著巨乳</i>

1877
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:18,515
<i>這是一個睪丸癌患者關懷小組</i>

1878
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:21,887
<i>這個用口水將我澆灌的大漢, 就是鮑伯</i>

1879
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,119
我們依然是男人

1880
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,388
沒錯, 我們是男人

1881
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,690
男人非我們莫屬

1882
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:32,201
<i>八個月前, 鮑伯八個月前切除了睪丸
然後又做了荷爾蒙治療</i>

1883
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:36,101
<i>他之所以長出巨乳
是因為他的睪丸激素太高</i>

1884
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,300
<i>刺激體內雌性激素激增</i>

1885
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:42,106
<i>- 我感覺很舒服...</i>
- 他們又得對我進行縮胸了

1886
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,671
<i>...偎倚在這對濕潤的巨乳之間</i>

1887
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:48,980
<i>它們如此壯觀, 上帝的胸部也莫過於此</i>

1888
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,281
好了, 現在換你哭了

1889
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,916
<i>不對, 等等, 回退
讓我從頭說起</i>

1890
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,923
<i>六個月來, 我都無法入睡</i>

1891
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,556
<i>我無法入睡...</i>

1892
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,793
<i>失眠讓我感覺不到真實</i>

1893
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,960
<i>一切都變得虛幻</i>

1894
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:08,236
<i>一切都像是彼此的拷貝的拷貝...</i>

1895
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,364
<i>...的拷貝</i>

1896
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:18,239
<i>隨著外太空探索深入進行
一切發現便將以企業命名</i>

1897
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,408
<i>IBM恆星</i>

1898
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,812
<i>微軟星系</i>

1899
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,981
<i>星巴克行星</i>

1900
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,619
我需要你這周到外地去處理一些問題

1901
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,254
<i>今天一定是星期二
他繫著藍色矢車菊領帶</i>

1902
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:36,961
你才剛剛通知我, 就要我放下手頭的報告?

1903
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:41,632
先處理這些, 這是你的機票優惠券
遇到麻煩就打電話給我

1904
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,609
<i>他精神亢奮, 一定是灌了不少咖啡</i>

1905
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,845
<i>像許多人一樣, 我也癡迷於宜家的室內裝飾</i>

1906
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:54,284
是的, 我想要訂...

1907
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,651
...Erika Pekkari防塵套

1908
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,850
<i>如果我發現什麼好東西</i>
- 請等一下

1909
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,293
<i>就像那個陰陽形狀的咖啡桌
我就一定會去買</i>

1910
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:06,765
<i>Klipsk個人辦公組合</i>

1911
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:09,098
<i>Hovetrekke家用固定腳踏車</i>

1912
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,031
<i>抑或, 綠色條紋的Ohamshab沙發</i>

1913
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:18,602
<i>甚至配有環保原色
燈罩的Ryslampa電燈</i>

1914
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,478
<i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder</i>

1915
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,642
<i>"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"</i>

1916
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:29,487
<i>我都買了, 甚至這些帶有
不規則氣泡的玻璃盤子</i>

1917
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:34,688
<i>proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

1918
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:37,731
<i>- Please hold.
- ..wherever.</i>

1919
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,326
<i>人們曾經看色情圖片尋求刺激</i>

1920
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:43,269
<i>如今是看Horchow產品目錄</i>

1921
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:46,739
- 不會, 你不會因為失眠癥死掉
- 那嗜睡癥呢?

1922
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:49,209
我常打盹, 醒的時候卻在不同的地方

1923
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,338
我完全不知道是怎麼到那的

1924
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:55,247
- 你得放鬆心情
- 求你能不能給就我點安眠藥?

1925
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:58,947
<i>紅紅藍藍的吐諾爾, 速可眠...</i>

1926
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:02,813
不行, 你需要的是健康自然的睡眠

1927
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:07,019
嚼一些纈草根, 多做運動

1928
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,125
嘿, 拜託

1929
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,294
- 我很痛苦
- 你想見識一下痛苦?

1930
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,930
星期二晚上, 去第一衛理公會轉轉

1931
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,100
看看那些患有睪丸癌的傢伙

1932
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:21,269
那才叫痛苦

1933
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,563
我一直想要三個孩子
兩個男孩和一個女孩

1934
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,065
而曼迪想要兩個女孩和一個男孩

1935
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,137
我們從來沒有意見一致過

1936
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,270
如今...

1937
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,866
她上個星期生了第一個孩子

1938
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:54,173
一個女孩

1939
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,511
跟她的新任丈夫

1940
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,410
干

1941
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,813
謝天謝地, 要知道...

1942
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,982
我真為她高興

1943
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,762
那是她應得的...

1944
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,401
各位, 感謝托馬斯與
我們分享他的經歷

1945
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,563
謝謝, 托馬斯

1946
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:23,142
環顧這個房間, 我看到的是勇氣

1947
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,303
這也給我力量

1948
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,745
我們在給予彼此力量

1949
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,112
It's time for the one-on-ones.

1950
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:35,121
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

1951
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,247
請各自尋找搭檔

1952
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:42,590
<i>我這就是這樣認識巨乳大漢的</i>

1953
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:47,462
<i>他早就已經熱淚盈眶</i>

1954
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,769
<i>雙膝併攏, 以彆扭的碎步走向我</i>

1955
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,072
- 我叫鮑伯
- 鮑伯?

1956
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:03,047
<i>鮑伯曾經是健美冠軍</i>

1957
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:06,815
<i>你知道晚間的那種健胸節目嗎? </i>

1958
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,982
<i>那是他的主意</i>

1959
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:11,150
我吃禁藥

1960
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:13,353
服用類固醇

1961
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:15,955
戴伯諾和...

1962
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:18,364
...韋斯特洛

1963
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:22,370
我的天啊, 那可是給賽馬用的

1964
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,965
如今, 我破產了

1965
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:27,901
離婚了

1966
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,772
我的兩個孩子

1967
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,276
甚至不肯回電話給我

1968
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:39,448
<i>如此坦白的陌生人令我不知所措</i>

1969
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,316
沒關係, 科尼利厄斯

1970
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,486
好好的哭一場吧

1971
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:04,681
<i>接著, 情況有變, 我釋然了</i>

1972
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,874
太好了

1973
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:09,045
<i>沉浸於遺忘...</i>

1974
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,418
<i>...昏暗, 安靜與圓滿</i>

1975
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:18,123
<i>我找到了自由, 拋卻一切希望就是自由</i>

1976
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,659
沒關係

1977
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:27,131
<i>初生的嬰兒都沒我睡的香</i>

1978
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:33,337
<i>我上癮了</i>

1979
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:49,118
<i>如果我一言不發</i>

1980
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,892
<i>人們就會認為我得了絕癥</i>

1981
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:58,796
<i>他們哭得越兇, 我也哭得越兇</i>

1982
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:12,379
現在我們將穿越綠色之門
通往你的精神中樞...

1983
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,546
<i>我不是真的要死了</i>

1984
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:17,419
<i>我也沒患上癌癥或寄生蟲病</i>

1985
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:22,227
<i>我只是被世間萬物所圍繞的小小中心</i>

1986
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,200
把你的疼痛想像為一道治療白光

1987
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:30,398
照耀你的全身, 治癒你

1988
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,997
現在繼續冥想, 別忘了呼吸

1989
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:37,772
穿過房間的後門

1990
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:40,741
門通往哪裏呢?

1991
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,976
是你的洞穴

1992
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:44,952
走進去

1993
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,215
走進你的洞穴

1994
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:49,382
做的很好

1995
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,950
你將進入洞穴的深處

1996
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,722
And you're going to find

1997
00:10:55,798 --> 00:10:57,926
your power animal.

1998
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,367
滑啊

1999
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,543
<i>每晚我都會死一次</i>

2000
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:18,381
<i>每晚我又會重生一次</i>

2001
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:21,049
<i>死而復生</i>

2002
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,292
<i>鮑伯愛我是因為他認定
我的睪丸也被切除了</i>

2003
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:30,196
<i>身處此處, 緊貼著他的巨乳</i>

2004
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,360
<i>準備哭泣</i>

2005
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:35,099
<i>這簡直就是我的假期</i>

2006
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,035
<i>但是她...</i>

2007
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,773
<i>...毀掉了這一起</i>

2008
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,974
這裏是癌癥, 對吧?

2009
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:49,082
<i>這個女人, 瑪拉·辛格</i>

2010
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:51,815
<i>沒得睪丸癌</i>

2011
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:54,016
<i>她是個騙子</i>

2012
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:56,185
<i>她根本就沒有生病</i>

2013
00:11:56,262 --> 00:12:00,061
<i>我見過她, 在星期二的
"自由與潔淨"血液寄生蟲病小組</i>

2014
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:03,591
<i>還有"希望"鐮狀細胞貧血癥小組</i>

2015
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:09,063
<i>還有在星期五晚上的
"把握今朝"肺結核小組</i>

2016
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,200
<i>瑪拉</i>

2017
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,746
<i>這個大閒人</i>

2018
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,940
<i>她的謊言拆穿了我的謊言</i>

2019
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,543
<i>突然間, 我失去了感覺</i>

2020
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:23,281
<i>我哭不出來了, 因此再次的...</i>

2021
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,449
<i>...我睡不著了</i>

2022
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:38,905
<i>下一個小組, 在冥想調理之後</i>

2023
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,440
<i>在我們打開精神中樞之後,
當我們相互擁抱的時刻</i>

2024
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,672
<i>我要抓住瑪拉·辛格這個婊子, 大罵...</i>

2025
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:49,740
瑪拉, 你這個騙子, 大閒人
我需要這些, 你給我滾

2026
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,252
<i>我四天沒有睡了</i>

2027
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,187
（我們只要讓他晾乾...）

2028
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,727
<i>你一旦患上失眠癥, 便無法真正入睡</i>

2029
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:02,285
<i>也無法真正清醒</i>

2030
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,956
今晚的交流...

2031
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,763
...由克蘿伊來做開場白

2032
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:11,805
<i>哦耶, 克蘿伊</i>

2033
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:17,668
<i>克蘿伊看起來就像
骷髏版的梅裏爾·斯特裏普</i>

2034
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,806
<i>面帶微笑, 對大家極為和善</i>

2035
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,375
那麼, 我還活著

2036
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,880
可我不知道還有多久

2037
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,815
沒有人能夠確定的回答我

2038
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,892
但是我有一個好消息

2039
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:34,725
我已不再畏懼死亡

2040
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:42,401
但是, 我現在卻很孤獨

2041
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,533
沒有人願意跟我做愛

2042
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:51,113
我就快要死了, 我不過想要做最後一次愛

2043
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:55,174
我家裏有色情電影

2044
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:58,950
- 還有潤滑劑和催情劑
- 謝謝, 克蘿伊

2045
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,784
各位, 讓我們感謝克蘿伊

2046
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,020
謝謝, 克蘿伊

2047
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,665
現在, 讓我們開始冥想調理

2048
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:15,204
你正站在洞穴的入口

2049
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:19,166
你進入洞穴, 往裏走

2050
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:22,371
<i>我的癌癥, 就是瑪拉</i>

2051
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>瑪拉</i>

2052
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:29,944
<i>猶如嘴角的傷疤, 只要你不去舔它, 它就會痊癒</i>

2053
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,148
<i>但你忍不住</i>

2054
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:35,891
你走到洞穴的更深處

2055
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:39,556
你會感受到治療的能量籠罩你的全身

2056
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:44,260
現在你找到了你的精神動物

2057
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,198
滑啊

2058
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,115
好吧, 開始分組

2059
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:58,514
選一個今晚對你特別的人

2060
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,817
嘿

2061
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:09,287
- 我要跟你談談
- 可以

2062
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:16,194
- 我知道你的底細
- 什麼?

2063
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,398
沒錯, 你在裝假, 你不會死

2064
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:21,270
對不起?

2065
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:26,337
按西藏哲學, 西爾維亞·普拉思理念
世間常識, 我們都會死

2066
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:30,646
- 但你不會像克蘿伊那樣死
- 所以?

2067
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,312
所以你是個閒人

2068
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:37,620
我見過你, 在黑素瘤見過你
在肺結核見過你

2069
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:40,217
我在睪丸癌也見過你

2070
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,922
我看到你練習過這個

2071
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,465
- 練習什麼?
- 訓我這些話

2072
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:48,367
結果和你預想的一樣嗎, 魯珀特?

2073
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,267
我會揭發你的

2074
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,432
去啊, 我也會揭發你

2075
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:56,042
大家一起來, 放聲哭泣吧

2076
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,145
哦, 天哪, 你幹嘛要這麼做?

2077
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,985
這比看電影便宜, 還有咖啡喝

2078
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,854
這很重要, 這些是屬於我的小組

2079
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,054
我已經來這快一年了

2080
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:16,360
- 你幹嘛又做這些?
- 我不知道

2081
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:20,300
當人們以為你快要死了
他們就會聽真心你講話, 而不會...

2082
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,362
心不在焉, 只想著自己

2083
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:26,734
沒錯, 沒錯

2084
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:30,779
釋放你自己, 全身心的

2085
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,674
聽著, 你不會想參合進來的

2086
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,810
- 這會上癮的
- 真的?

2087
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,186
我沒開玩笑, 有另一個人裝假
我就哭不出來, 但我需要這些

2088
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,350
你得另找其他的地方

2089
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:45,988
祝你好運, 可這不關我的事

2090
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,227
不, 等一下, 別走

2091
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,396
我們把一周分開, 如何?

2092
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,699
淋巴瘤和肺結核歸你

2093
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,902
肺結核歸你吧, 那組不讓我抽煙

2094
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:02,311
好吧, 睪丸癌沒有爭議吧

2095
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:06,317
嚴格來講, 我比你更合適這組
因為你還長著蛋蛋

2096
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,751
- 開玩笑呢吧
- 不知道, 你說呢?

2097
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,854
不, 不

2098
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:13,585
- 那你要什麼?
- 我要寄生蟲

2099
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,458
你不能兩個全要吧
血液寄生蟲給你

2100
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:20,863
- 我要大腦寄生蟲
- 那血液寄生蟲歸我, 可我還想要大腦癡呆

2101
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,731
- 我要那個
- 你不能要所有大腦的吧

2102
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,328
目前為止, 你有四個, 我只有兩個

2103
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:30,342
好吧, 給你兩個寄生蟲的, 他們歸你了

2104
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,674
現在我們各有三個...

2105
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,044
嘿, 你還有一半衣服沒拿

2106
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,764
- 什麼, 你在賣這些衣服?
- 沒錯

2107
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,897
我是在賣衣服

2108
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,065
那麼, 我們各有三個, 一共六天

2109
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:04,009
第七天怎麼辦? 我要腸癌

2110
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,172
<i>這女的也是研究過的</i>

2111
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:08,374
不, 不, 我要腸癌

2112
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,077
你也最喜歡那個?

2113
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,678
- 想從我這順手牽羊?
- 聽著, 我把這個也分了吧

2114
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,849
每個月的單數周你去

2115
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,193
成交

2116
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,098
看來要說再見了

2117
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,329
這沒什麼大不了的

2118
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,872
這本來也沒什麼大不了的啊

2119
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,140
嘿, 瑪拉

2120
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,640
瑪拉

2121
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:41,309
我們換個電話號碼吧

2122
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,318
需要嗎?

2123
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,480
- 或許我們有時會想調換時間
- 好吧

2124
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:55,155
<i>我就是這樣認識瑪拉·辛格的</i>

2125
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,132
<i>瑪拉的生活哲學是
你隨時都可能死掉</i>

2126
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,537
<i>而悲劇在於她一直沒死</i>

2127
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:07,667
上面沒你的名字, 你叫啥?
科尼利厄斯? 魯珀特?

2128
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:11,704
還是特拉維斯? 到底是哪個傻名字?

2129
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,745
<i>我在西雅圖醒來</i>

2130
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,790
<i>接著舊金山, 洛杉磯</i>

2131
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,257
<i>我又在奧黑爾醒來</i>

2132
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,488
<i>接著達拉斯, 沃斯堡</i>

2133
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,531
<i>再接著巴爾的摩</i>

2134
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,398
<i>太平洋時區, 山地時區, 中央時區
減去一小時, 再加上一小時</i>

2135
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,371
兩個小時後才能辦理登機, 先生

2136
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,738
<i>我的生命在一分一分的流逝</i>

2137
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,802
<i>我又在哈勃機場醒來</i>

2138
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,082
<i>倘若在不同時間, 不同地點醒來</i>

2139
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,815
<i>我還會是我嗎? </i>

2140
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,980
<i>我每到一處</i>

2141
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,354
<i>就瑣事不斷</i>

2142
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,951
<i>一袋糖精, 一袋奶精</i>

2143
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,826
<i>一包黃油</i>

2144
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,764
<i>微波食品套餐</i>

2145
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,802
<i>旅行洗髮洗浴套裝</i>

2146
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:06,771
<i>簡裝牙刷, 外加一小塊肥皂</i>

2147
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,734
<i>我在每架飛機上遇到的每個人</i>

2148
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,937
<i>他們也不過都是一次性朋友</i>

2149
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:16,745
<i>在起飛與降落之間
我們分享彼此的時間</i>

2150
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:19,047
<i>僅次而已</i>

2151
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:21,053
（歡迎）

2152
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:27,355
<i>總之時辰一到, 大家都得玩完</i>

2153
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:31,160
<i>我是一名汽車召回協調員
我的工作就是調用公式</i>

2154
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,633
嬰兒就是從擋風玻璃這甩出來的

2155
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:37,796
<i>這是我們公司出產的新車款, 時速60英里</i>

2156
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,966
<i>後輪差數排檔卡死</i>

2157
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:43,603
那個孩子的牙套還掛在後座煙灰缸上

2158
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,045
可以做個戒煙廣告了

2159
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,640
<i>汽車相撞後燃燒, 無一生還</i>

2160
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,015
<i>那麼, 我們需要召回這款車嗎? </i>

2161
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:54,181
那父親肯定是個大胖子

2162
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:57,487
看到殘留在座位上的肥油了嗎?
滌綸襯衫?

2163
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:59,584
很現代藝術

2164
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:02,153
<i>把這輛車的序列數, A</i>

2165
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,962
<i>乘以故障率, B</i>

2166
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:08,834
<i>再乘以庭外和解所需費用, C</i>

2167
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,998
<i>A乘以B再乘以C</i>

2168
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,107
得出X

2169
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,804
如果X少於召回的成本

2170
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,904
我們就不會召回

2171
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:21,211
這種事故很多嗎?

2172
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,219
絕對超出你的想像

2173
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:27,213
你是哪家汽車公司的?

2174
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,418
很大的一家

2175
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:35,831
<i>每當飛機起飛或著陸
做大角度傾斜飛行時</i>

2176
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,199
<i>我會祈禱飛機墜毀, 或在空中相撞</i>

2177
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:41,428
<i>諸如此類</i>

2178
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:54,013
<i>商務旅行的人身保險理賠
是一般情況下的三倍</i>

2179
00:21:56,955 --> 00:22:00,255
"如果你坐在緊急出口旁邊

2180
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:03,852
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

2181
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:08,366
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

2182
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,228
你責任重大啊

2183
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:14,535
想要換位子嗎?

2184
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,076
不, 我不想, 我這人難堪重任

2185
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:22,548
三萬英尺高的緊急出口

2186
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,707
還安全個屁

2187
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,043
沒錯, 我想也是

2188
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,055
知道為什麼飛機上會有氧氣罩嗎?

2189
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:34,685
- 讓我們呼吸唄
- 氧氣讓人亢奮

2190
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:39,323
在緊急狀況時, 人因恐慌會大口的呼吸

2191
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,924
瞬間就會變得興奮, 服帖

2192
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,301
進而聽天由命

2193
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,963
這上面都有寫

2194
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,203
水面迫降, 時速六百英里

2195
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,144
面無懼色, 平靜的像印度憨牛

2196
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:55,307
那個...

2197
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,815
很有意思的理論

2198
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:02,949
- 你做什麼的?
- 你什麼意思?

2199
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:05,118
你做什麼維持生計?

2200
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:08,356
幹嘛? 然後你好假裝感興趣?

2201
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:12,523
好吧

2202
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,502
你笑聲裏帶著某種病態的絕望

2203
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,800
我們的手提箱一模一樣

2204
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:23,634
肥皂

2205
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:27,410
- 什麼?
- 我製造銷售肥皂

2206
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,915
這可是文明的標誌

2207
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,387
<i>我就是這樣認識的...</i>

2208
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,319
泰勒·德頓

2209
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:39,658
你知道嗎, 如果把汽油和凍橙汁混合
就可以做成凝固汽油彈

2210
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:42,732
- 不知道, 真的嗎?
- 真的

2211
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,633
日常用品可以做出各種各樣的炸彈

2212
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,171
- 真的?
- 只要你想做

2213
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:59,208
泰勒, 你是我所遇到過的
最有意思的一次性朋友

2214
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:05,215
- 飛機上的東西都是一次性的
- 哦, 明白了, 真聰明

2215
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,847
謝謝

2216
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:09,050
這對你有什麼好處?

2217
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,891
- 什麼?
- 聰明啊

2218
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,362
挺爽

2219
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:17,424
那就繼續吧, 保持住

2220
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,798
出於禮貌問一句

2221
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,864
我經過的時候, 是該用屁股還是褲襠對著你?

2222
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,249
<i>我跟著泰勒住是因為...</i>

2223
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,618
<i>航空公司有關振動行禮的規定</i>

2224
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,928
- 有嘀嗒聲?
- 投手清楚現代炸彈是不會嘀嗒響的

2225
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:53,199
- 抱歉, 投手?
- 行禮搬運工

2226
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,503
但是一旦發現旅行箱振動

2227
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:58,303
投手就必須報警

2228
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:01,903
- 我的旅行箱在振動?
- 十有八九

2229
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:04,074
是電動剃鬚刀

2230
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:06,278
有時候也會是...

2231
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:11,282
it's a dildo.

2232
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:16,120
可公司的規定從沒把自慰器列為禁品

2233
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,098
<i>We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never</i>

2234
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,260
<i>your dildo.</i>

2235
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:24,430
我沒有...

2236
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,236
<i>我所有的東西都在那個旅行箱裏
我的CK襯衫</i>

2237
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:33,474
<i>DKNY皮鞋, AX領帶</i>

2238
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:37,481
<i>無所謂了</i>

2239
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:42,084
嘿, 那是我的車

2240
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,365
<i>我住在15層的公寓裏</i>

2241
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,491
<i>裏面住滿了寡婦和上班族</i>

2242
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:56,197
<i>強是澆築混凝土結構</i>

2243
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,364
<i>混凝土結構是很重要的</i>

2244
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:02,741
<i>既能夠阻擋鄰居看比賽時發出的噪音</i>

2245
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:06,713
<i>又可以阻擋你被炸爛財產進到隔壁</i>

2246
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:10,810
<i>而使其只是從窗戶被炸出
火光在夜間還可以充當燈塔</i>

2247
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:19,558
<i>我想這種事真的發生了</i>

2248
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,503
上面什麼都沒剩下

2249
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:37,980
你不能進去, 這是警察的命令

2250
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:49,182
你有人可以聯絡嗎?

2251
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,387
<i>太尷尬了</i>

2252
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:54,364
<i>屋子裏只有調味料, 卻沒有食物</i>

2253
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:07,576
<i>事後警察告訴我
可能是監視燈壞掉了</i>

2254
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:11,549
<i>致使燃氣洩漏</i>

2255
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:13,881
<i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>

2256
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:17,479
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.</i>

2257
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:29,465
<i>然後接觸到冰箱壓縮機</i>

2258
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,629
喂?

2259
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,835
我能聽到你在喘氣...

2260
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:50,423
<i>即使你現在問我
我也說不清為什麼打電話給他</i>

2261
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:35,900
- 你好
- 哪位?

2262
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,233
- 泰勒嗎?
- 你哪位?

2263
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:43,973
我們在飛機上見過

2264
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,311
我們的手提箱一模一樣

2265
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,475
那個聰明人?

2266
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,918
哦耶, 沒錯

2267
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:55,551
我剛給你打了一個, 但沒人接聽

2268
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:59,857
- 我用的是公用電話
- 沒錯, 我從來不接電話, 只回撥電話

2269
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,693
你什麼事?

2270
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,394
那個

2271
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:09,564
說了你也不信

2272
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,939
知道嗎, 這還算好

2273
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:17,777
睡著時被女人割了老二, 扔出車外
那才叫真慘

2274
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:21,915
還有那種事嗎? 沒聽說過

2275
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:25,114
每次我買傢俱時, 都告訴自己, 這就夠了

2276
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:27,283
這個沙發是我最後一個要買的

2277
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,157
不管怎麼樣, 沙發的問題解決了

2278
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:33,686
我什麼都有, 我有一個套很高級立體聲音響

2279
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:37,326
一件很體面的衣櫃

2280
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,563
我馬上就要置辦齊全了

2281
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:42,199
- 媽的, 哥們兒, 現在你一無所有了
- 一無所有

2282
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:45,037
一無所有

2283
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:48,336
你聽說過羽絨被嗎?

2284
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,315
- 棉被?
- 是毯子

2285
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:55,376
就一毯子而已, 你我幹嘛要知道羽絨被是個啥呢?

2286
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:59,619
有必要這麼事事斟酌, 斤斤計較嗎?

2287
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,353
不

2288
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,418
我們算什麼?

2289
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:06,124
不知道, 消費者?

2290
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,258
沒錯, 我們就是消費者

2291
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:11,634
我們深陷物質生活之中

2292
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:15,640
謀殺, 犯罪, 貧困, 這些我們不在乎

2293
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:19,179
我們只在乎名人雜誌

2294
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:21,339
帶有500個頻道的電視

2295
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:24,077
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

2296
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,245
Viagra. Olestra.

2297
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:29,186
- 瑪莎·斯圖爾特
- 去他媽的瑪莎·斯圖爾特

2298
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:32,748
她造的泰坦尼克, 早晚都得沉, 哥們兒

2299
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:36,592
去他媽的綠色條紋沙發

2300
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:39,997
要我說絕不要齊全

2301
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:42,093
要我說也不要當完人

2302
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:44,229
要我說我們要進化

2303
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:46,604
要活得瀟灑

2304
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,870
但這只是我個人, 也許我錯了

2305
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,038
也許對你來說沒了那些是個悲劇

2306
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:55,606
不過是些身外物, 說不上悲劇...

2307
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:59,451
你確實損失了不少多功能的現代傢俱

2308
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,115
媽的, 你說得對, 不了, 我不抽煙

2309
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:09,260
我的保險應該會賠償這些, 所以...

2310
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:13,828
怎麼了?

2311
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:17,065
你所控制的東西反過來控制你

2312
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,468
你隨意吧, 哥們兒

2313
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:25,647
哦, 很晚了

2314
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:28,446
- 嘿, 謝謝請啤酒
- 不客氣

2315
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:30,611
我還得找家賓館

2316
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,448
什麼?

2317
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:35,150
什麼?

2318
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,318
- 賓館?
- 是啊

2319
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:40,488
- 開口問嘛, 哥們兒
- 你什麼意思?

2320
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,330
哦, 我的天, 都喝了三扎啤酒
你還不好意思問

2321
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,963
什麼?

2322
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,699
你打電話給我, 是因為你想找個地方住

2323
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,232
- 哦, 嘿, 不是, 不是, 不是
- 是, 你是, 開口問就是了

2324
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,871
用不著前戲, 直接問, 哥們兒

2325
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,946
會不會給你添麻煩啊?

2326
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,111
你開口就問麻煩嗎?

2327
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,351
- 我能住你的地方嗎?
- 當然

2328
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,784
謝謝

2329
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,958
- 我想你幫我個忙
- 好, 沒問題

2330
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,468
我要你用最大的力量打我

2331
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,505
什麼?

2332
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:24,407
我要你用最大的力量打我

2333
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,411
<i>讓我來先簡單介紹一下泰勒·德頓</i>

2334
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,979
<i>泰勒是個夜貓子</i>

2335
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,313
我們睡覺的時候, 他工作

2336
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:35,548
他兼職做電影放映員

2337
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,614
電影起初並不是在一個膠捲上, 而是幾卷

2338
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:42,422
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

2339
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,761
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

2340
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:49,768
如果細心, 你會在屏幕的右上方看到一些小點

2341
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,567
我們行話管這個叫香煙烙點

2342
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,733
那就是換到下一卷的記號

2343
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:59,576
在電影進行中, 他會更換放映機
而觀眾們對此卻毫不知情

2344
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,911
為什麼會有人做這種狗屁工作?

2345
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:05,179
因為這能讓他有機會搞怪

2346
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:08,780
例如把色情圖像插入普通家庭片中

2347
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:13,850
所以, 當你觀看由名人配音的
有關阿貓阿狗的卡通片時

2348
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:18,194
你就會發現泰勒的傑作一閃而過

2349
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,667
沒人知道他們看到了什麼
但他們確實看到了

2350
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,337
漂亮, 好大的屌

2351
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,881
泰勒搞這個的速度比蜂鳥還要快

2352
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:48,254
泰勒有時也會在豪華飯店當宴會侍者

2353
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:56,963
他是餐飲服務業的流竄恐怖分子

2354
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,372
別看著我, 你看著我, 我尿不出來

2355
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:03,846
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

2356
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:06,474
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

2357
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,608
別客氣, 說出來

2358
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:10,676
你們猜到了吧

2359
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:14,120
- 你要我幹嘛, 打你?
- 來吧, 幫我個忙

2360
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:17,591
- 為什麼?
- 不知道, 不知道為啥, 我沒打過架, 你呢?

2361
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:21,655
- 沒有, 但這不挺好嘛
- 你沒打過架, 就沒法瞭解你自己

2362
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:24,099
我不想死的時候連一道傷痕都沒有

2363
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:28,468
- 來吧, 打我, 趁我還有興致
- 哦, 天啊, 你瘋了吧

2364
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,838
那就瘋一下, 干一架

2365
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,605
- 我不清楚這個做好不好
- 我也不清楚

2366
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:36,739
管他媽的呢, 又沒人看著
你有什麼可擔心的

2367
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:39,316
這太瘋了, 你要我打你?

2368
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,476
沒錯

2369
00:34:41,553 --> 00:34:44,751
- 打哪? 打臉嗎?
- 隨你便

2370
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:49,019
這太他媽傻了

2371
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:02,100
干你娘

2372
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:04,267
你竟然打我耳朵

2373
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:07,541
- 那個, 老天, 對不起
- 哇啊, 天啊,

2374
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,706
- 為啥打耳朵, 哥們兒?
- 我搞砸了

2375
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:11,512
不, 干的很好

2376
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,524
不, 沒關係

2377
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:29,461
真的很疼

2378
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:31,963
沒錯

2379
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,535
再打我

2380
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,736
不, 換你打我了, 來啊

2381
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,186
有時間我們應該再幹一場

2382
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:11,208
- 你的車呢?
- 什麼車?

2383
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:24,056
<i>我不知道泰勒是怎麼找到那房子的</i>

2384
00:36:24,194 --> 00:36:26,425
<i>不過他說他已經在那住一年了</i>

2385
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,396
<i>這看起來好像是待拆除的危房</i>

2386
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,865
<i>大多數窗戶都被封死了</i>

2387
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:37,339
<i>前門沒有上鎖, 無論是警察
還是誰, 想進就能進</i>

2388
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,467
<i>樓梯隨時都會垮掉</i>

2389
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:42,068
<i>我不知道這房子是他的
還是他偷著住的</i>

2390
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:44,681
<i>哪個我都不奇怪</i>

2391
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,643
好了, 這間是你的

2392
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,346
那間是我的, 那邊是廁所, 不錯吧?

2393
00:36:50,422 --> 00:36:52,480
不錯, 多謝

2394
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,490
<i>什麼鬼地方啊</i>

2395
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:56,561
<i>沒什麼是好使的</i>

2396
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:04,100
<i>打開一盞燈就意味著
房間裏另一盞燈就會滅</i>

2397
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,967
<i>附近沒有鄰居, 只有倉庫和一家造紙廠</i>

2398
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,033
<i>那裏蒸汽惡臭, 像死老鼠加爛木屑</i>

2399
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:16,212
看那邊怎麼回事?

2400
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:33,091
- 嘿, 夥計們
- 嘿

2401
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:47,137
<i>每逢下雨, 我們必須切斷電源</i>

2402
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:51,449
<i>到了第一月月底, 我都沒想看過電視</i>

2403
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:55,820
<i>我甚至不在乎熱乎乎的破冰箱</i>

2404
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,296
我下一個好嗎?

2405
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,769
可以, 哥們兒

2406
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,869
鬆開領帶

2407
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:27,288
<i>夜裏, 泰勒和我就一起在
方圓一里半內四處亂逛</i>

2408
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:36,664
<i>雨水透過天花板的石膏和電燈裝置滴落</i>

2409
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,566
<i>所有木製的東西都膨脹收縮</i>

2410
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:42,865
<i>每個地方都有會掛住你衣袖的生銹釘子</i>

2411
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:45,533
<i>之前的住戶一定是足不出戶</i>

2412
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:47,701
嘿, 哥們兒, 你在讀什麼?

2413
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:52,145
聽聽這個, 這文章是以器官第一人稱寫的

2414
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:54,979
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

2415
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:58,543
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."

2416
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:00,715
這裏有好多

2417
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,883
"我是吉爾的乳頭"

2418
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:08,888
- "我是傑克的直腸"
- "我得了癌癥, 我害死了傑克"

2419
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:15,936
<i>打架過後, 生活中的其他一切變得寂靜</i>

2420
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,637
什麼?

2421
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:23,306
<i>一切問題都迎刃而解</i>
- 你報告寫完了嗎?

2422
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:30,547
如果可以選, 你最想和誰打?

2423
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:32,715
和我老闆, 可能吧

2424
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,918
真的?

2425
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:38,360
- 沒錯, 怎麼了? 你會和誰打?
- 和我老爸

2426
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,523
我不認識我爸

2427
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,533
我是說, 我認識他, 但...

2428
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:44,968
在我六歲左右時, 他離開了我

2429
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:48,028
和別的女人結了婚, 又生了幾個孩子

2430
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,199
他每六年就來這麼一次

2431
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:54,439
- 他換個城市, 就重新成家
- 這混球是在開連鎖店啊

2432
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,374
我爸沒上過大學

2433
00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:01,386
- 所以我就必須去上
- 聽起來耳熟

2434
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:05,892
我畢了業, 打長途問他
"爸, 現在怎麼辦? "

2435
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:07,984
- 他說, "找份工作"
- 我也一樣

2436
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,756
現如今我25歲, 還是每年打一個電話

2437
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,821
"爸, 現在怎麼辦? "

2438
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:15,027
他說, "不知道, 結婚吧"

2439
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:18,594
我們沒法結婚

2440
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:21,432
我是個30歲的大男孩

2441
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:23,999
我們這一代男人都是被女人養大的

2442
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:28,378
我不確定再找一個女人
是否就真的能解決問題

2443
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:37,586
<i>大多數時候, 我像兩口子過日子</i>

2444
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,895
<i>不過每到週六晚上, 我們會出去找樂子</i>

2445
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:46,589
<i>我們樂子越找越多, 而且我們並不孤獨</i>

2446
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:55,135
<i>我以前回家不是氣憤就是鬱悶, 只能打掃公寓</i>

2447
00:40:55,243 --> 00:40:57,303
<i>給我的北歐傢俱打蠟</i>

2448
00:40:57,446 --> 00:41:02,474
<i>我本應該找一處新公寓
或者去找保險公司理賠</i>

2449
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:06,317
<i>我本應該為我燒掉的一切而難過</i>

2450
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:08,320
<i>但是我沒有</i>

2451
00:41:08,457 --> 00:41:12,087
各公司的網絡側重於提高效率

2452
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:15,028
<i>週一早上起來, 我就思索這一周會如何</i>

2453
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,123
我能用藍色矢車菊做標誌嗎?

2454
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:19,327
當然可以

2455
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:22,700
效率優先, 各位

2456
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:25,636
因為浪費就是偷竊

2457
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,837
我就是這麼告誡我的員工的
你喜歡, 是不是?

2458
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:36,452
<i>在你生病前, 你可以吞下一品脫的血</i>

2459
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:39,717
<i>每個人臉上都隱藏著這種表情</i>

2460
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,951
<i>泰勒和我不過是表現出來</i>

2461
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:44,493
<i>每個人心裏也都隱藏著這些話</i>

2462
00:41:44,562 --> 00:41:46,655
<i>泰勒和我不過是說了出來</i>

2463
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,934
各位, 你們得回家了

2464
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,499
關掉音樂, 把後門鎖上

2465
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:49,123
<i>每周泰勒都會公佈
他和我制定的規則</i>

2466
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:51,255
先生們

2467
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,124
歡迎來到搏擊俱樂部

2468
00:42:56,236 --> 00:42:58,397
搏擊俱樂部第一條規則是

2469
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:00,871
不可以透露搏擊俱樂部

2470
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,570
搏擊俱樂部第二條規則是

2471
00:43:03,978 --> 00:43:07,414
絕不可以透露搏擊俱樂部

2472
00:43:07,548 --> 00:43:09,813
搏擊俱樂部第三條規則

2473
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:12,682
有人喊停, 受傷倒地, 體力不支

2474
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:15,550
搏擊結束, 第四條規則

2475
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:17,956
一場搏擊只能有兩個人

2476
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,891
第五條規則

2477
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:22,657
一次就一場, 夥計們

2478
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:25,233
第六條規則, 打時脫掉襯衫和鞋子

2479
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:29,236
第七條規則, 搏擊沒有時間限制

2480
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:33,667
第八條規則, 也是最後一條

2481
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,006
如果你是初次參加搏擊俱樂部

2482
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,173
你就必須得打

2483
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,280
<i>辦公室來的小弟, 瑞奇</i>

2484
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,883
<i>上班時什麼事都記不住, 做不好</i>

2485
00:43:50,993 --> 00:43:53,393
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

2486
00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:56,830
<i>when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>

2487
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:04,038
<i>有時, 吶喊聲中, 只能聽見打鬥的聲音</i>

2488
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,837
<i>或是滿嘴是血的喘氣和咳嗽聲</i>

2489
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,939
停

2490
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,918
<i>只有在這裏, 生命才是有意義的</i>

2491
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,820
<i>但是搏擊俱樂部僅存在於
開始與結束間的幾小時</i>

2492
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:24,351
<i>即使我稱讚某人打得很棒</i>

2493
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:26,760
<i>可在俱樂部之外, 他卻完全變樣</i>

2494
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,163
<i>人們在俱樂部內外判若兩人</i>

2495
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:35,296
<i>剛來搏擊俱樂部的人, 屁股都是光滑圓潤</i>

2496
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:38,241
<i>幾周之後, 就會像雕過的木頭</i>

2497
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:42,275
如果你可以和名人對打, 你選誰?

2498
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,475
- 活著的還是死了的
- 無所謂, 誰最強悍?

2499
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:49,513
海明威, 你呢?

2500
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:53,318
夏特納, 我要和威廉·夏特納對打

2501
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,590
<i>我們對事物的看法開始不同</i>

2502
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:02,198
<i>無論到哪, 我們都會評論一番</i>

2503
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:08,701
<i>我覺得去健身房的人都可悲</i>

2504
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:12,871
<i>想要練成Calvin Klein和
Tommy Hilfiger的模特身材</i>

2505
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,074
那是男人的樣子嗎?

2506
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:18,815
哦, 自我成長靠的是自慰

2507
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,977
而自我毀滅...

2508
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:23,079
借過

2509
00:45:57,726 --> 00:46:00,923
<i>搏擊俱樂部無關乎輸贏</i>

2510
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:03,055
<i>也不關乎言辭</i>

2511
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,459
<i>真正的吶喊是含在嘴裏的</i>

2512
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:10,538
<i>就像聖靈降臨教徒</i>

2513
00:46:15,077 --> 00:46:17,170
- 不過如此
- 停

2514
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:20,147
<i>搏擊結束後, 沒什麼需要處理</i>

2515
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:22,150
<i>也什麼也都無所謂</i>

2516
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:25,016
酷

2517
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,886
<i>總之, 我們如同被救贖一般</i>

2518
00:46:28,826 --> 00:46:31,090
嘿, 哥們兒, 下周再來如何?

2519
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:33,253
下個月如何?

2520
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:35,422
歐文, 該你上場

2521
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:37,558
新來的, 還有你

2522
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:41,464
<i>有時候, 泰勒會替我說話</i>

2523
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:43,665
我從樓梯上摔下來

2524
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:46,401
我從樓梯上摔下來

2525
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:52,910
<i>因為搏擊俱樂部, 我們剪髮剪指甲</i>

2526
00:46:53,017 --> 00:46:55,484
好吧, 歷史人物呢?

2527
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,452
我會和甘地對打

2528
00:46:58,089 --> 00:46:59,920
答得妙

2529
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:02,254
- 你呢?
- 林肯

2530
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,922
林肯?

2531
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:08,624
他身高臂長, 骨瘦如柴
不打到死不會叫停

2532
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,593
干

2533
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:15,467
嘿, 就是蒙娜麗莎也得掉牙

2534
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,949
你好?

2535
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,451
你這兩個月跑哪去了? </i>

2536
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,851
瑪拉?

2537
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:35,954
- 你怎麼找到我的?
- 你在答錄機上留的

2538
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,053
我在哪個互助小組都沒見到你

2539
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:42,329
我們把他們分了, 當時的主意, 還記得嗎?

2540
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:45,268
沒錯, 可你沒有去的那些小組

2541
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:48,865
- 你怎麼知道的?
- 我耍賴了

2542
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:50,773
我找到新小組了

2543
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:53,575
- 真的?
- 只供男士參加

2544
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,272
跟睪丸什麼的一樣嗎?

2545
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:01,077
聽著, 我現在不方便通話

2546
00:48:01,154 --> 00:48:03,589
我參加了購物狂小組

2547
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:07,252
- 那些人是最操蛋的...
- 我要出門了

2548
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:09,694
我也是, 我吃了一肚子安眠藥

2549
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:12,095
把瓶子裏剩的都吃了

2550
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,259
可能吃得太多了

2551
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,964
<i>想像著瑪拉·辛格在家裏亂撞的樣子</i>

2552
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:22,565
我這不算是什麼自殺, 頂多算求助什麼的

2553
00:48:22,677 --> 00:48:25,579
So you're staying in tonight, then?

2554
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:28,514
你要不要聽我描述一下死亡?

2555
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:33,111
要不要看看我還有多少精神講電話?

2556
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:38,019
你以前有沒有聽過人死前的胡話?

2557
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:09,155
<i>泰勒的門關上了, 我在這兩個月
他的門從來沒關過</i>

2558
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:17,224
你不會相信, 我昨晚做的夢

2559
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:20,599
你也不會相信昨晚發生的事

2560
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:32,383
你在這裏做什麼?

2561
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:37,179
什麼?

2562
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:39,689
這是我的房子, 你在我房子裏幹嘛?

2563
00:49:42,093 --> 00:49:44,084
幹你的

2564
00:49:58,711 --> 00:50:02,078
哦, 你朋友可真夠風騷的

2565
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:04,172
很有彈性

2566
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,241
浪女一個

2567
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,050
我昨晚進來, 看見電話沒掛

2568
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:12,215
猜猜對方是誰?

2569
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:14,486
<i>不用他說, 我也知道經過</i>

2570
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:20,392
你以前有沒有聽過人死前的胡話?

2571
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:23,300
你認為這會不會辜負這個名字?

2572
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:26,998
或者這會不會只是一個死的毛團?

2573
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:34,403
準備驅散靈魂

2574
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,108
<i>Ten,</i>

2575
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:39,015
<i>nine,... eight...</i>

2576
00:50:39,087 --> 00:50:41,317
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>

2577
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:45,290
<i>think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

2578
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,020
<i>Five,</i>

2579
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:48,687
<i>four...</i>

2580
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,523
3... 等一下

2581
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,303
你來得還真快

2582
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:02,936
我給你打過電話嗎?

2583
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:16,750
這床墊實在是太滑了

2584
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:22,396
哦, 別擔心, 那東西可比不上你

2585
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:27,101
哦, 日

2586
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,263
有人報警了

2587
00:51:41,184 --> 00:51:44,677
- 嘿, 513房間在哪?
- 走廊最後那間

2588
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:49,357
住在那的女孩本來可愛動人的

2589
00:51:49,426 --> 00:51:51,587
她只是對自己失去了信心

2590
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:54,528
- 辛格小姐, 我們是來幫你的
- 她是個怪物

2591
00:51:54,598 --> 00:51:58,729
- 你有充分的理由活下去
- 她是個骯髒的人渣

2592
00:51:58,803 --> 00:52:02,602
- 辛格小姐
- 祝你們救得下她

2593
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:09,607
If I fall asleep,

2594
00:52:09,714 --> 00:52:11,978
I'm done for.

2595
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:16,147
You're gonna have to keep me up

2596
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:18,314
all night.

2597
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,723
太他媽不可思議了

2598
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,988
<i>他顯然有能力解決這個問題</i>

2599
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:26,758
- 你明白我的意思, 你幹過她
- 不, 我沒有

2600
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:28,959
- 從沒有?
- 沒

2601
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:31,996
你不喜歡她嗎?

2602
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:34,163
不, 天啊, 一點也不

2603
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:36,834
<i>我成了傑克的倒霉膽管</i>

2604
00:52:36,976 --> 00:52:38,876
你確定嗎? 告訴我沒關係

2605
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:40,842
相信我, 我確定

2606
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,246
<i>不如一槍打爆我的頭, 讓腦漿四濺</i>
那還好

2607
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:47,080
她是一隻披著羊皮的狼, 離她遠點

2608
00:52:49,055 --> 00:52:52,685
這女人滿嘴粗話, 連我都沒聽說的

2609
00:52:52,793 --> 00:52:54,454
我的天

2610
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:57,894
自高中以來, 我就沒幹過這麼爽的

2611
00:52:58,031 --> 00:53:00,465
<i>泰勒怎麼會不喜歡這種人呢?</i>

2612
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:04,094
<i>前一晚, 他還把性器官切入"灰姑娘"</i>

2613
00:53:04,204 --> 00:53:07,003
瑪拉要的不是愛情, 而是他媽的安慰

2614
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:09,668
或者發洩, 這不是愛情, 不過是日逼運動

2615
00:53:09,776 --> 00:53:12,644
<i>她先是闖入我的互助小組
如今又闖入我家</i>

2616
00:53:12,714 --> 00:53:14,807
嘿, 嘿, 坐下

2617
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:22,322
聽著, 你不能和她談起我的事

2618
00:53:22,423 --> 00:53:24,254
我幹嘛要...

2619
00:53:24,325 --> 00:53:29,695
你要跟她說起任何有關我
或這房子的事, 我們就絕交

2620
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:32,459
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

2621
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:34,661
- 好的, 我保證
- 保證

2622
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:38,138
- 我剛說了, 我保證, 什麼...
- 你可保證了三次

2623
00:53:39,642 --> 00:53:43,635
<i>如果我當時花幾分鐘
等著瑪拉·辛格死掉</i>

2624
00:53:43,712 --> 00:53:45,805
<i>這些事就不會發生</i>

2625
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,654
用力, 耶, 用力, 用力

2626
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:02,730
<i>我本可以搬到另一個房間</i>

2627
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:07,701
<i>在三樓我就聽不到他們的聲音</i>

2628
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:09,864
<i>但是我沒有搬</i>

2629
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:38,194
- 你在幹嘛?
- 準備上床睡覺

2630
00:54:38,302 --> 00:54:40,362
想來搞定她嗎?

2631
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:46,801
- 不, 不用, 多謝
- 我找到了一根煙

2632
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:50,279
- 你在和誰說話?
- 閉嘴

2633
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:53,614
<i>我成為世界安靜的中心</i>

2634
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:56,346
<i>我是禪宗大師</i>

2635
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:03,485
<i>我開始寫短篇俳句詩</i>

2636
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,428
<i>把他們電郵給所有人</i>

2637
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:08,624
那是你的血嗎?

2638
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:12,395
有些是, 沒錯

2639
00:55:12,505 --> 00:55:15,167
你不能在這抽煙

2640
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,335
放你一天的假

2641
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:19,935
回家換些乾淨衣服, 週一再來上班

2642
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:22,139
把自己收拾一下

2643
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:24,848
<i>每個人的臉上都帶有敵意</i>

2644
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:27,443
<i>"沒錯, 這些是打架後的瘀青"</i>

2645
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:29,613
<i>"沒錯, 我樣子很爽"</i>

2646
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:31,588
<i>"我覺醒了"</i>

2647
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:38,658
<i>放棄了公寓的生活
放棄了豐厚的財產</i>

2648
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:41,826
<i>搬到臭氣熏天的破房子</i>

2649
00:55:41,935 --> 00:55:45,803
<i>回到家後竟然還要面對這個</i>

2650
00:55:56,451 --> 00:55:59,852
- 你好
- 我是縱火案組的斯特恩警探</i>

2651
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:04,186
關於你公寓的事故
我找到一些新線索

2652
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:05,556
好的

2653
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:10,565
不知道你是否清楚
有人在你的門鎖上噴了氟利昂

2654
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:13,295
然後用鑿子擊打門鎖來引起火花

2655
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:15,392
不, 我根本不知道這些

2656
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,462
<i>我成了傑克的冷汗</i>

2657
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,837
你覺得奇怪嗎?

2658
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,776
是的, 長官, 奇怪, 很奇怪

2659
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:24,870
- 炸藥
- 炸藥?

2660
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,074
現場有殘留的銨酸鉀氯化鹽

2661
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:31,654
- 你知道這意味著什麼嗎?
- 不知道, 意味著什麼?

2662
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,655
意味著炸藥是自製的

2663
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:37,989
對不起, 這太不可思議了, 長官

2664
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:43,624
很可能是安放炸藥的人
在爆炸前搞壞了監視燈

2665
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,794
- 燃氣不過是導火索
- 誰會這麼做呢?

2666
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,929
- 我正要問你呢
- 告訴他啊

2667
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:53,476
告訴他是那些自由主義者
毀掉了你的財產, 重塑了你的信仰

2668
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,637
抱歉, 你還在聽嗎?

2669
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:58,647
我在聽, 我搞不清楚這是怎麼回事

2670
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:03,210
你最近有惹到過會做自製炸藥的仇家嗎?

2671
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:05,551
- 仇家?
- 抵制文明

2672
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:07,716
尤其是物質財產

2673
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:10,692
- 小子, 事態嚴重
- 是的, 我知道這很嚴重

2674
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,355
- 我是說真的
- 是的, 事態很嚴重

2675
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:16,298
聽著, 沒人比我把這事看得更嚴重了

2676
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:19,098
那公寓是我的生命, 知道嗎?

2677
00:57:19,238 --> 00:57:22,730
我愛那裏面每一件傢俱

2678
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:25,867
被毀掉的不是那一堆東西

2679
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:28,845
而是我自己
<i>我要感謝大學教育</i>

2680
00:57:28,914 --> 00:57:32,941
- 你現在不方便說這件事嗎?
- 就告訴他是他媽的你做的嘛

2681
00:57:33,051 --> 00:57:36,920
告訴他是你炸的, 這是他想聽你說的

2682
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:41,892
- 你還在聽嗎?
- 等一下, 你是說我是嫌犯嗎?

2683
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,954
不, 我可能需要找你談話
所以你要外出的話就告訴我

2684
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:48,465
- 好嗎?
- 好的

2685
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:55,767
<i>除了做愛, 泰勒和瑪拉從沒
在一個房間裏出現過</i>

2686
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:58,936
<i>我父母也曾這個樣子好多年</i>

2687
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:02,779
安全套是我們這代人的玻璃鞋

2688
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:05,784
遇到陌生人就套上一個

2689
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:07,945
你整晚跳舞

2690
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:10,115
然後就把它扔了

2691
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:12,985
我是說扔安全套, 不是陌生人

2692
00:58:14,528 --> 00:58:15,995
什麼?

2693
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:23,633
我在一元店花一塊錢買的這件禮服

2694
00:58:23,738 --> 00:58:25,602
一分錢一分貨

2695
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:27,766
這是件結婚禮服

2696
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:31,940
Someone loved it intensely

2697
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:34,038
for one day.

2698
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:36,242
然後就拋棄它

2699
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,178
就像聖誕樹

2700
00:58:40,322 --> 00:58:42,415
如此特別

2701
00:58:42,525 --> 00:58:43,958
卻又...

2702
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:45,823
崩一聲

2703
00:58:45,928 --> 00:58:47,986
就被扔在了路邊

2704
00:58:48,563 --> 00:58:50,657
裝飾品都還掛在上面呢

2705
00:58:52,735 --> 00:58:54,794
就像被強姦的人一樣

2706
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,963
內褲還反穿著

2707
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:01,474
- 被絕緣帶捆綁著
- 好吧, 這衣服挺合你身

2708
00:59:01,577 --> 00:59:04,273
你喜歡隨時可以借你

2709
00:59:11,287 --> 00:59:13,381
趕她走

2710
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:17,058
- 什麼? 你趕她走啊
- 別提我

2711
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,358
<i>我又回到了六歲, 替父母相互傳話</i>

2712
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:26,963
- 我想你是時候離開了
- 別擔心, 我馬上走

2713
00:59:27,038 --> 00:59:31,667
- 不是我們不歡迎你來
- 你是個神經病, 我受不了你了

2714
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:36,712
我走了哦

2715
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,076
謝謝, 再見

2716
00:59:38,182 --> 00:59:44,121
不可以再繼續留戀下去

2717
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:48,724
不可以, 必須...

2718
00:59:48,827 --> 00:59:50,852
不可以...

2719
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:54,497
你們真逗

2720
00:59:56,502 --> 00:59:58,993
你為什麼還要浪費時間在她身上?

2721
00:59:59,071 --> 01:00:01,403
你這是因為瑪拉嗎

2722
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,738
至少她試圖去觸底

2723
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:05,139
我才沒有

2724
01:00:05,244 --> 01:00:08,077
就算在屁股上插幾根羽毛, 你也不是個雞

2725
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,240
我們今晚幹嘛?

2726
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:13,147
今晚, 我們做肥皂

2727
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,245
真的?

2728
01:00:15,354 --> 01:00:18,188
要做肥皂, 我們得先提煉出脂肪

2729
01:00:37,077 --> 01:00:39,307
鹽量必須達到正確的比例

2730
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:41,938
所以做肥皂最好的脂肪是人類脂肪

2731
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,844
- 等下, 這是什麼地方?
- 抽脂診所

2732
01:00:53,928 --> 01:00:55,954
發現目標

2733
01:00:56,064 --> 01:00:59,897
世界上最富養分最為油膩的脂肪
脂肪中的極品

2734
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:09,068
不, 不要拽, 不要拽

2735
01:01:13,682 --> 01:01:15,946
- 哦, 天啊
- 再給我一包

2736
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,549
提煉脂肪時, 動物脂就會浮到表面

2737
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:27,721
就像童子軍時學的

2738
01:01:27,797 --> 01:01:31,598
- 很難想像你當童子軍
- 繼續攪拌

2739
01:01:33,936 --> 01:01:37,497
動物脂一旦變硬, 撇去表面的甘油

2740
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,974
加入硝酸, 就得到硝化甘油

2741
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:43,910
然後加入硝酸鈉和木屑, 就得到炸藥

2742
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,815
沒錯, 只要肥皂做夠, 你想炸什麼都行

2743
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,977
<i>泰勒滿腦子的小聰明</i>

2744
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:54,012
以前人們發現在河流的
某段落洗衣服會更乾淨

2745
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:56,149
- 你知道為什麼嗎?
- 不知道

2746
01:01:58,996 --> 01:02:02,797
活人祭祀在河上游的山上進行

2747
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:06,063
屍體焚燒之後, 河水溶解灰燼產生堿液

2748
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,605
這就是堿液, 重要的配料

2749
01:02:08,673 --> 01:02:13,474
一旦混合了熔化的人體脂肪
白色的肥皂成份就會生成並進入河水

2750
01:02:13,578 --> 01:02:15,637
我能看看你的手嗎?

2751
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:24,251
這是幹嘛?

2752
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:26,949
這叫做化學灼傷

2753
01:02:27,025 --> 01:02:30,553
- 比其他灼傷都要痛, 而且會留下疤痕
- 你幹嘛?

2754
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:33,257
<i>精神調理不僅治療癌癥, 也治療這個</i>

2755
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:36,830
- 體會一下這種疼痛
- 哦, 天啊

2756
01:02:37,636 --> 01:02:42,073
第一塊肥皂來自英雄燃後的灰燼
就像第一個進入太空的猴子

2757
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:45,167
沒有痛苦, 沒有犧牲
我們就一無所有

2758
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:48,180
<i>我試著不去想有關血肉灼燒的單詞</i>

2759
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:51,410
停下, 這就是你的痛
這就是你灼燒的手

2760
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,180
我要去我的洞穴, 找我的精神動物

2761
01:02:54,254 --> 01:02:58,281
不, 不要用將死之人的方式逃避疼痛, 來啊

2762
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:02,384
- 我明白了
- 不, 你還沒有完全覺悟

2763
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,260
這是你一生中最偉大的時刻, 你卻在逃避

2764
01:03:09,337 --> 01:03:10,860
我沒有

2765
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:13,929
閉嘴, 我們的父親就是我們神的分身

2766
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,204
連父親都拋棄我們, 更何況上帝?

2767
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:23,445
聽我說, 你必須瞭解
上帝可能並不喜歡你

2768
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:27,647
他從沒想要過你, 很有可能, 他討厭你

2769
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:31,284
但這算不上什麼, 因為我們不需要神

2770
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,328
- 我同意
- 去他媽的詛咒, 去他媽的救贖

2771
01:03:34,428 --> 01:03:36,920
我們是上帝遺棄的子民, 我們就是

- 聽著, 用水你的手就廢了, 看著我

2773
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:46,163
- 不如用醋來中和
- 放開我

2774
01:03:46,275 --> 01:03:48,334
首先, 你必須放棄一切

2775
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:51,140
First, you have to know, not fear,

2776
01:03:51,247 --> 01:03:54,239
know that some day, you're gonna die.

2777
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:56,546
你不知道這有多疼

2778
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,790
我們只有拋棄一切, 才能自由自在

2779
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:08,889
好的

2780
01:04:22,146 --> 01:04:24,171
恭喜你

2781
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:27,182

我會非常非常小心的跟那人說話

不, 我沒聽清你說什麼, 盧

就他媽讓你用地下室, 天啊

2923
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,807
我要你保證, 盧, 我要你保證

2924
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,867
以聖母之名

2925
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,147
謝謝, 盧

2926
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,551
還有你, 大個兒

2927
01:14:22,496 --> 01:14:24,590
我們下周見

2928
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:43,677
本周, 你們都有一份家庭作業

2929
01:14:43,785 --> 01:14:48,621
你們要出去, 找一個陌生人打一架

2930
01:14:51,861 --> 01:14:54,022
你們要去打一架

2931
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,223
但你們必須輸

2932
01:14:58,201 --> 01:15:00,136
眼光不錯, 先生

2933
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:06,004
嘿, 小心點, 混蛋, 來啊

2934
01:15:06,409 --> 01:15:09,038
<i>這可不像聽起來那麼容易</i>

2935
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:13,717
狗娘養的

2936
01:15:13,817 --> 01:15:18,550
<i>大多數人, 正常人, 只會盡力避免打鬥</i>

2937
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,550
抱歉

2938
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,357
你用水管淋到我了, 沒必要...

2939
01:15:25,463 --> 01:15:27,362
傑伊, 打911

2940
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:32,160
把水管放下

2941
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,329
住手, 住手

2942
01:15:35,974 --> 01:15:37,874
對不起

2943
01:15:53,392 --> 01:15:55,860
我們需要談談

2944
01:15:58,097 --> 01:16:00,190
好吧

2945
01:16:00,299 --> 01:16:02,358
從何談起呢?

2946
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:04,663
談你經常性的曠工?

2947
01:16:04,737 --> 01:16:07,298
談你著裝邋遢?

2948
01:16:07,374 --> 01:16:09,399
你馬上就要接受考核了

2949
01:16:09,508 --> 01:16:12,705
我如傑克般一點都不驚訝

2950
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:14,713
- 什麼?
- 我們假設

2951
01:16:14,781 --> 01:16:17,682
你是交通部門的, 好吧

2952
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:21,414
Someone informs you that this company

2953
01:16:21,521 --> 01:16:25,582
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

2954
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:29,094
跑過1000英里後, 制動片就會壞掉

2955
01:16:29,163 --> 01:16:33,599
燃油噴射系統會爆炸, 還燒死過人

2956
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,566
你怎麼辦?

2957
01:16:35,636 --> 01:16:37,934
你這是威脅我嗎?

2958
01:16:38,006 --> 01:16:40,804
- 不是...
- 你他媽給我滾出去, 你被解雇了

2959
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:45,345
我有個更好的解決方案
你把我轉為外勤員工

2960
01:16:45,413 --> 01:16:47,506
只要付給我薪水

2961
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:51,417
我的工作就是永遠不洩露我所知道的

2962
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,785
我都不用上班, 在家就能工作了

2963
01:16:57,059 --> 01:17:01,189
你他媽以為自己是誰啊, 你這個小瘋子

2964
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:09,995
保安
<i>我是傑克得意的復仇</i>

2965
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:21,075
你到底在幹嘛?

2966
01:17:30,293 --> 01:17:32,386
好痛

2967
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:35,890
你幹嘛要這麼做?

2968
01:17:36,567 --> 01:17:39,558
哦, 天啊, 不, 求你住手

2969
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:51,006
你在幹嘛?

2970
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:54,176
哦, 天啊, 不, 求你, 不

2971
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:58,382
<i>不知為何, 我想起了我和泰勒打的第一架</i>

2972
01:17:58,457 --> 01:18:00,048
不

2973
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:28,944
<i>從裏到外, 徹徹底底
這個男人已經感到</i>

2974
01:18:29,055 --> 01:18:32,513
<i>事態越來越嚇人</i>

2975
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,683
聽著

2976
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:38,492
支付我所要求的薪水
我將永遠在你眼前消失

2977
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:41,363
<i>接著, 在恰到好處的時刻...</i>

2978
01:18:44,437 --> 01:18:47,167
謝天謝地, 求你別再打我了

2979
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:49,367
<i>電話, 電腦</i>

2980
01:18:49,476 --> 01:18:54,641
<i>傳真機, 52周的薪水, 48張機票優惠券</i>

2981
01:18:54,715 --> 01:18:57,115
<i>我們如今有了公司贊助</i>

2982
01:18:57,184 --> 01:19:02,350
<i>這就是泰勒和我如何能夠
每晚都舉辦搏擊俱樂部的</i>

2983
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:08,587
<i>如今, 搏擊俱樂部的主角是搏擊的兩個人</i>

2984
01:19:08,695 --> 01:19:12,154
<i>領導人則在陰暗的人群中走來走去</i>

2985
01:19:13,935 --> 01:19:18,463
<i>Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>

2986
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,804
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

2987
01:19:25,981 --> 01:19:28,972
<i>我如傑克般浪費生命</i>

2988
01:19:36,725 --> 01:19:38,784
感謝你, 先生

2989
01:19:40,296 --> 01:19:43,288
<i>泰勒設計了新的家庭作業</i>

2990
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:45,924
<i>裝在密封的信封裏佈置下去</i>

2991
01:20:25,076 --> 01:20:28,773
- 特拉華城也有搏擊俱樂部了
- 對, 我聽說了

2992
01:20:30,582 --> 01:20:32,776
朋斯格羅夫也有了

2993
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:35,080
鮑伯在紐卡斯爾也發現一個

2994
01:20:35,186 --> 01:20:38,247
- 那個不是你辦的嗎?
- 不是, 我以為是你辦的

2995
01:20:38,357 --> 01:20:40,848
不是

2996
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:31,905
- 先停一下
- 嘿, 我們要做什麼?

2997
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:34,037
- 轉過身去
- 我們要做什麼?

2998
01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:36,549
- 家庭作業
- 哪種作業

2999
01:21:36,651 --> 01:21:38,675
活人祭祀

3000
01:21:38,752 --> 01:21:42,085
- 那是把槍嗎? 求你告訴我不是
- 是把槍

3001
01:21:42,156 --> 01:21:44,523
- 你要幹什麼?
- 到後面等我

3002
01:21:44,626 --> 01:21:46,958
- 別他媽亂來
- 到後面等我

3003
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:48,859
<i>在這麼長的時間僵持下</i>

3004
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:51,831
<i>不管是誰, 倖存率都已降到零點</i>

3005
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:54,893
你這是幹嘛? 拜託

3006
01:21:54,969 --> 01:21:58,371
把手放到後面, 錢包給我

3007
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:03,440
雷蒙德·K·海塞爾
班寧街, 1320號, 公寓A

3008
01:22:04,245 --> 01:22:07,443
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

3009
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:10,144
They give shitty apartments letters.

3010
01:22:10,252 --> 01:22:13,346
雷蒙德, 你就要死了

3011
01:22:13,456 --> 01:22:14,923
不要

3012
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:19,154
這是你爸爸媽媽嗎?
他們得去找法醫驗屍

3013
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:21,526
檢查你的牙醫記錄, 知道為什麼嗎?

3014
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:25,158
- 因為你將面目全非
- 哦, 拜託

3015
01:22:25,267 --> 01:22:29,170
一張過期的社區大學學生證
你學什麼的, 雷蒙德?

3016
01:22:29,272 --> 01:22:32,298
- 一些東西
- 東西?

3017
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:34,468
期中考試難嗎?

3018
01:22:35,612 --> 01:22:38,172
- 我問你是學什麼的
- 生物學, 基本上

3019
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:41,773
- 為什麼?
- 我不知道

3020
01:22:41,885 --> 01:22:44,877
你想要做什麼, 雷蒙德·K·海塞爾?

3021
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:50,226
我在問你, 雷蒙德, 你想要做什麼?

3022
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:53,988
回答他, 雷蒙德, 天啊

3023
01:22:54,098 --> 01:22:56,497
- 獸醫, 獸醫
- 動物

3024
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,570
- 對, 動物和一些...
- 東西, 沒錯, 我明白了

3025
01:22:59,637 --> 01:23:02,197
- 所以你還有很多書要讀
- 還有非常多

3026
01:23:02,306 --> 01:23:04,775
- 那你願意死嗎?
- 不, 求求你...

3027
01:23:04,843 --> 01:23:09,302
那你情願跪著死在這, 便利店的後面嗎?

3028
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,007
求你, 我不要

3029
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,179
我留著你的證件

3030
01:23:18,423 --> 01:23:21,416
會不時去看你, 我知道你住哪

3031
01:23:21,527 --> 01:23:24,519
如果六個星期內, 你成不了獸醫

3032
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,724
你就死定了

3033
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,659
現在跑回家去吧

3034
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:37,467
跑啊, 阿甘, 跑啊

3035
01:23:39,145 --> 01:23:41,204
我要瘋了

3036
01:23:42,015 --> 01:23:44,074
想像一下他現在的感受

3037
01:23:44,184 --> 01:23:46,243
拜託, 這不好玩

3038
01:23:46,352 --> 01:23:48,787
這他媽的是什麼意思啊?

3039
01:23:48,856 --> 01:23:52,985
明天將是雷蒙德·K·海塞爾
一生中最為美好的一天

3040
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:57,429
他的早餐會比你我吃的任何一餐都香

3041
01:23:58,866 --> 01:24:00,959
<i>你不得不佩服他</i>

3042
01:24:01,035 --> 01:24:03,401
走吧
<i>他早有計劃</i>

3043
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:06,907
<i>泰勒式的處世之道越來越有道理</i>

3044
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:08,907
<i>無所畏懼, 便無所憂愁</i>

3045
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:12,308
<i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>

3046
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:14,404
<i>truly slide.</i>

3047
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,922
你的工作不能代表你

3048
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:35,234
你銀行裏的存款不能代表你

3049
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,031
你開的車不能代表你

3050
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,409
你錢包裏的東西不能代表你

3051
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:44,810
你的Khaki衣服也他媽不能

3052
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:51,313
你不過是這世中手舞足蹈的一坨屎

3053
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:02,358
我馬上就走

3054
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,259
你不需要離開的

3055
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,862
隨便你

3056
01:25:09,973 --> 01:25:13,067
不是, 我是說... 沒關係的

3057
01:25:22,586 --> 01:25:24,714
你還在去互助小組嗎?

3058
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,483
去啊

3059
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:31,052
克蘿伊死了

3060
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:33,520
哇哦, 克蘿伊

3061
01:25:33,598 --> 01:25:35,532
什麼時候的事?

3062
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,965
你在乎嗎?

3063
01:25:38,069 --> 01:25:41,402
不知道, 我很久沒想過這個了

3064
01:25:41,706 --> 01:25:43,765
對, 那...

3065
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:46,208
沒準她死了倒好

3066
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,605
聽著...

3067
01:25:50,915 --> 01:25:53,282
你這樣有什麼好處呢?

3068
01:25:53,986 --> 01:25:56,079
什麼?

3069
01:25:56,188 --> 01:25:58,520
我是說, 這一切, 你為什麼總是...

3070
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,351
這樣做讓你開心嗎?

3071
01:26:02,962 --> 01:26:05,021
對, 沒錯, 有時候是

3072
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:08,893
我不知道, 我不明白

3073
01:26:08,969 --> 01:26:12,530
為什麼弱小的人總要向強大的人靠攏?

3074
01:26:12,606 --> 01:26:14,732
為什麼呢?

3075
01:26:14,807 --> 01:26:16,969
你又有什麼好處?

3076
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:20,538
不對... 這根本不是一回事

3077
01:26:20,614 --> 01:26:22,742
我們情況完全不同

3078
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:24,909
我們?

3079
01:26:24,985 --> 01:26:26,919
你說我們是什麼意思?

3080
01:26:26,987 --> 01:26:30,856
- 對不起, 你聽到了嗎?
- 聽到什麼?

3081
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:32,983
- 你聽不到這些噪音嗎? 等一下
- 不, 等等

3082
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,789
不要岔開話題, 我要談談這個

3083
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:38,627
- 你們不是在談論我吧, 是嗎?
- 不是

3084
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:42,202
- 什麼?
- 那天, 你到我那, 假裝醫生, 那是怎麼回事?

3085
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:45,535
- 你們在說什麼?
- 沒什麼, 沒什麼

3086
01:26:45,607 --> 01:26:47,665
- 我可不這麼想
- 拜託, 你想要什麼?

3087
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:50,208
- Look at me.
- No. What?

3088
01:26:50,978 --> 01:26:53,812
- 那是什麼?
- 沒什麼, 別擔心

3089
01:26:53,882 --> 01:26:56,282
我的天, 這是誰弄的?

3090
01:26:56,385 --> 01:26:58,443
- 一個人
- 男的還是女的?

3091
01:26:58,552 --> 01:27:01,351
- 你管男的女的幹嘛?
- 我問問又怎麼了?

3092
01:27:01,423 --> 01:27:04,017
- 這不關你的事, 讓我一個人呆著
- 你不敢說了

3093
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:06,083
- 我沒有, 放開我
- 不, 告訴我

3094
01:27:06,194 --> 01:27:07,355
放開我

3095
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:10,159
- 我們的談話...
- 我們的談話...

3096
01:27:10,232 --> 01:27:12,700
- 到此為止
- 到此為止

3097
01:27:13,568 --> 01:27:16,663
我就是沒辦法討你喜歡, 是嗎?

3098
01:27:26,015 --> 01:27:28,483
嘿, 這招太老套了吧

3099
01:27:29,086 --> 01:27:31,417
這些都是幹嘛的?

3100
01:27:31,487 --> 01:27:33,580
你認為呢?

3101
01:27:34,524 --> 01:27:36,652
嘿, 我們要上下鋪幹嘛?

3102
01:27:36,727 --> 01:27:38,592
嘿

3103
01:27:45,436 --> 01:27:47,267
你太年輕

3104
01:27:47,337 --> 01:27:48,998
抱歉

3105
01:27:49,073 --> 01:27:51,133
那是幹嘛?

3106
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:54,210
如果應徵者年輕, 就說他們太小了

3107
01:27:54,278 --> 01:27:56,906
- 年齡大的太老了, 胖的太肥了
- 應徵者?

3108
01:27:57,014 --> 01:28:00,348
應徵者只有等上三天, 不吃不睡

3109
01:28:00,452 --> 01:28:02,511
他才可以進來接受培訓

3110
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:04,450
培訓什麼?

3111
01:28:10,061 --> 01:28:12,120
你以為這是遊戲?

3112
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:14,892
你太小了, 不能接受培訓, 到此為止

3113
01:28:14,966 --> 01:28:17,696
別浪費我們時間, 快他媽的滾

3114
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,699
壞消息, 朋友

3115
01:28:23,976 --> 01:28:26,068
這是不可能的

3116
01:28:26,144 --> 01:28:28,443
我很抱歉讓你誤會

3117
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,448
但這並非世界末日

3118
01:28:30,516 --> 01:28:32,711
走就是了

3119
01:28:33,586 --> 01:28:35,645
走吧

3120
01:28:35,721 --> 01:28:39,384
你這是擅闖民宅, 我們會報警的

3121
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,555
別瞪著我

3122
01:28:44,664 --> 01:28:47,928
你他媽永遠也別想進這房子

3123
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,368
永遠, 他媽的滾下我的走廊, 滾下去

3124
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:54,998
<i>遲早, 我們會變成泰勒所期望的人</i>

3125
01:28:55,108 --> 01:28:57,941
我要進去拿鏟子出來

3126
01:29:05,486 --> 01:29:07,681
- 拿兩件黑襯衫來
- 是, 長官

3127
01:29:07,755 --> 01:29:10,018
- 兩條黑褲子
- 是, 長官

3128
01:29:10,123 --> 01:29:13,093
- 一雙黑靴子和黑襪子
- 是, 長官

3129
01:29:13,161 --> 01:29:15,220
- 一件黑外套
- 是, 長官

3130
01:29:15,329 --> 01:29:18,321
- 自備300元喪葬費
- 是, 長官

3131
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:22,560
可以了

3132
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,440
你太老了, 肥仔

3133
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:37,713
你的奶子太大了, 別他媽站在我的走廊上

3134
01:29:45,527 --> 01:29:47,586
鮑伯, 鮑伯

3135
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,242
像準備升空的猴子一樣

3136
01:30:07,016 --> 01:30:08,483
太空猴子

3137
01:30:08,585 --> 01:30:12,078
準備犧牲自己換取劃時代的成果

3138
01:30:18,696 --> 01:30:21,392
你太他媽肥老了, 肥仔

3139
01:30:21,465 --> 01:30:24,662
And you... You're too fucking

3140
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,395
blond!

3141
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:28,802
給我滾出去, 你們兩個

3142
01:30:28,873 --> 01:30:31,000
<i>接下來就這樣</i>

3143
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:33,269
聽著, 敗類們

3144
01:30:33,378 --> 01:30:35,437
你並不特別

3145
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,078
你不是一片美麗的, 獨一無二的雪花

3146
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:43,518
你們不過是一群會腐朽的組織器官

3147
01:30:43,622 --> 01:30:45,715
<i>泰勒組建了一支軍隊</i>

3148
01:30:45,991 --> 01:30:49,620
<i>我們不過是這世上手舞足蹈的一坨屎</i>

3149
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,323
<i>我們不過是屎坑的一部分</i>

3150
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:57,631
<i>泰勒·德頓為什麼要組建軍隊? </i>

3151
01:30:57,703 --> 01:30:59,795
<i>目的何在? </i>

3152
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,306
<i>為了什麼劃時代成果? </i>

3153
01:31:05,645 --> 01:31:07,704
<i>我們相信泰勒</i>

3154
01:31:13,052 --> 01:31:15,714
當他說"你的工作不帶表你"

3155
01:31:15,821 --> 01:31:17,881
我得說"沒錯"

3156
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,852
嘿, 這是什麼?

3157
01:31:21,961 --> 01:31:24,055
嘿

3158
01:31:25,532 --> 01:31:27,227
好吧

3159
01:31:27,301 --> 01:31:29,667
- 這是怎麼回事?
- 我們在慶祝

3160
01:31:29,736 --> 01:31:32,261
- 慶祝什麼?
- 去吧

3161
01:31:36,276 --> 01:31:38,437
- 嘿
- 我來替你拿著

3162
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:45,918
（同樣的味道, 百事可樂, 新一代汽水）

3163
01:31:48,289 --> 01:31:50,519
Ssh!

3164
01:31:50,591 --> 01:31:54,391
（調查人員來了, 等下, 警察局長到了）

3165
01:31:54,495 --> 01:31:57,464
（局長, 你能告訴我們究竟發生了什麼嗎? ）

3166
01:31:57,532 --> 01:32:01,765
（我們認為這是近來城市裏發生的
一系列破壞公物行為中的一起）

3167
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:04,997
（可能跟地下拳擊俱樂部有關）

3168
01:32:05,106 --> 01:32:09,305
（我們準備展開專項調查行動）

3169
01:32:10,212 --> 01:32:14,581
（這就是剛抵達現場的
警察局長傑克柏的談話）

3170
01:32:14,683 --> 01:32:18,915
她好性感

3171
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:20,818
（現在將現場交回攝影棚內的主播）

3172
01:32:20,923 --> 01:32:23,324
- 耶!
- 耶!

3173
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:26,784
- 我的天啊
- 耶!

3174
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:36,162
你們這些傢伙他媽的幹了些什麼?

3175
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:40,335
縱火案組調查員先前...

3176
01:32:44,114 --> 01:32:48,642
長官, "暴亂"計劃的第一條規則是不能提問

3177
01:32:54,859 --> 01:32:57,384
The victory in the war against crime

3178
01:32:57,461 --> 01:32:59,554
will not come overnight.

3179
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:04,192
我們需要各位的堅持和承諾
最重要的是, 合作

3180
01:33:04,268 --> 01:33:09,206
街頭現在更安全了, 市區內也有希望, 然而...

3181
01:33:09,274 --> 01:33:11,264
我要去尿尿

3182
01:33:11,375 --> 01:33:14,140
這不過是萬里長征第一步

3183
01:33:14,212 --> 01:33:16,806
所以我們才設計"希望"計劃

3184
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:18,975
鮑伯

3185
01:33:22,087 --> 01:33:24,851
Project Hope will be ajoint effort

3186
01:33:24,956 --> 01:33:27,686
between the police and community leaders.

3187
01:33:27,793 --> 01:33:31,957
它將是打擊犯罪的新武器

3188
01:34:17,411 --> 01:34:21,542
- 勒住他那玩意, 鮑伯
- 他的蛋蛋冷得發抖

3189
01:34:23,551 --> 01:34:26,883
嗨, 你必須取消專項調查

3190
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:30,322
你得公開聲明不存在什麼地下組織, 否則...

3191
01:34:30,425 --> 01:34:32,723
他們會割下你的蛋蛋

3192
01:34:33,628 --> 01:34:37,429
分別一個寄到到紐約時報和洛杉磯時報

3193
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,262
聽著

3194
01:34:39,334 --> 01:34:42,429
你在追查的是那些你所依靠的人

3195
01:34:42,505 --> 01:34:46,066
我們為你做飯, 為你倒垃圾, 為你接電話

3196
01:34:46,175 --> 01:34:49,906
我們幫你開救護車, 你睡著時給你守門

3197
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:57,149
不要惹毛我們

3198
01:35:04,561 --> 01:35:06,688
看好你的蛋蛋

3199
01:35:21,012 --> 01:35:23,104
鮑伯, 你這邊走

3200
01:35:24,214 --> 01:35:26,547
我們走

3201
01:35:26,617 --> 01:35:29,814
<i>我猶如傑克般感到渾身不適</i>

3202
01:35:30,922 --> 01:35:32,980
嘿

3203
01:35:47,505 --> 01:35:48,768
耶

3204
01:36:21,541 --> 01:36:24,339
<i>我覺得我像在射殺貓熊</i>

3205
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:28,278
<i>雖然它們極力爭取生存</i>

3206
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:33,181
<i>I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers</i>

3207
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:36,154
<i>and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

3208
01:36:39,425 --> 01:36:41,894
<i>我想要呼吸渾濁的空氣</i>

3209
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:01,407
你要去哪, 神經小子?

3210
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:06,053
我想摧毀一些美好的東西

3211
01:37:09,592 --> 01:37:11,650
送他去他媽的醫院

3212
01:37:11,726 --> 01:37:13,819
好

3213
01:37:24,607 --> 01:37:27,667
別擔心, 德頓先生, 機場停車, 長期的

3214
01:37:29,145 --> 01:37:31,273
你先請, 德頓先生

3215
01:37:32,215 --> 01:37:34,307
你先請

3216
01:37:52,069 --> 01:37:54,664
- 你有心事, 親愛的?
- 沒有

3217
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:57,969
為什麼不告訴我"暴動"計劃?

3218
01:37:58,075 --> 01:38:01,068
"暴動"計劃第一條規則是不能提問

3219
01:38:01,145 --> 01:38:03,545
為什麼不一開始就讓我參與?

3220
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:08,847
搏擊俱樂部就是開始, 它已經從地下室裏搬出來
現在叫做"暴動"計劃

3221
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:13,323
搏擊俱樂部是我們倆一起創立的, 記得嗎?
是我們兩個人共同擁有的

3222
01:38:13,391 --> 01:38:17,657
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

3223
01:38:17,729 --> 01:38:21,165
但這並不屬於你我, 我們沒什麼特殊的

3224
01:38:21,265 --> 01:38:23,700
去你的, 你應該先告訴我的

3225
01:38:24,536 --> 01:38:26,527
嘿, 泰勒

3226
01:38:28,373 --> 01:38:30,865
- 該死, 泰勒
- 你想要什麼?

3227
01:38:30,943 --> 01:38:33,411
計劃書嗎? 我是不是該電郵給你一份呢?

3228
01:38:33,512 --> 01:38:36,140
- 哦
- 你決定自己要不要加入

3229
01:38:36,215 --> 01:38:38,911
我會的, 我要第一個知道細節

3230
01:38:38,984 --> 01:38:41,612
- "暴動"計劃第一條規則...
- 閉嘴

3231
01:38:43,389 --> 01:38:47,121
- 我要知道你的想法
- 去你媽的想法

3232
01:38:47,193 --> 01:38:50,684
忘掉你有關生活和友誼的想法吧, 朋友

3233
01:38:50,763 --> 01:38:52,823
尤其有關你和我的想法

3234
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,161
這話什麼意思?

3235
01:38:59,573 --> 01:39:01,733
你在幹什麼?

3236
01:39:02,642 --> 01:39:05,372
在臨死之前, 你想做什麼?

3237
01:39:05,445 --> 01:39:08,313
- 畫一幅自畫像
- 造一座房子

3238
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:10,782
- 你呢?
- 我不知道, 沒什麼

3239
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:13,250
- 回到車道上
- 你必須弄清楚這個問題

3240
01:39:13,386 --> 01:39:16,413
如果你現在死掉, 你會怎麼看之前的生活?

3241
01:39:16,524 --> 01:39:20,153
我不知道! 我感覺我的生活一點都不好
這就是你想聽的嗎?

3242
01:39:20,227 --> 01:39:22,560
- 拜託
- 不完全是

3243
01:39:22,631 --> 01:39:25,064
別他媽亂搞了, 泰勒

3244
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,597
老天爺啊

3245
01:39:29,337 --> 01:39:31,430
該死的, 該死的, 干你娘

3246
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,599
去他媽的搏擊俱樂部, 去他媽的瑪拉

3247
01:39:33,675 --> 01:39:36,337
我受不了你那堆廢話了

3248
01:39:36,445 --> 01:39:38,345
好吧, 哥們兒

3249
01:39:40,148 --> 01:39:42,673
- 別再亂搞了, 把住方向盤
- 看看你

3250
01:39:42,784 --> 01:39:45,548
- 把住方向盤
- 看看你, 你多他媽可悲

3251
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:50,752
- 為什麼, 為什麼, 你在說什麼啊?
- 你為什麼會認為是我炸了你的公寓?

3252
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,884
什麼?

3253
01:39:52,995 --> 01:39:56,896
觸底不是歡度週末
這不是該死的討論小組

3254
01:39:56,998 --> 01:40:00,696
別再試圖控制一切, 隨其自然吧

3255
01:40:02,438 --> 01:40:04,269
隨其自然

3256
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:06,467
好吧, 好了

3257
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:09,244
好了

3258
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,108
<i>我從來沒出過車禍</i>

3259
01:41:10,175 --> 01:41:13,633
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

3260
01:41:13,712 --> 01:41:16,909
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

3261
01:41:16,982 --> 01:41:19,076
該死

3262
01:41:22,589 --> 01:41:25,751
我剛有了一次瀕臨死亡的體驗

3263
01:41:29,596 --> 01:41:31,587
在那個世界中, 我看到

3264
01:41:31,698 --> 01:41:35,566
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

3265
01:41:35,669 --> 01:41:38,661
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

3266
01:41:40,674 --> 01:41:45,009
你後半輩子都將身著皮製的衣服

3267
01:41:45,112 --> 01:41:49,674
你順著藤蔓爬到西爾斯大廈之上

3268
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,312
當你向下看, 你會看到一個個小點
他們在舂糧食...

3269
01:41:54,388 --> 01:41:57,949
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

3270
01:41:58,025 --> 01:42:00,323
of some abandoned superhighway.

3271
01:42:13,775 --> 01:42:16,005
感覺好些了吧, 哥們兒

3272
01:42:33,363 --> 01:42:35,160
<i>在那之後...</i>

3273
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:36,789
泰勒?

3274
01:42:36,866 --> 01:42:38,959
<i>泰勒離開了</i>

3275
01:42:46,342 --> 01:42:48,368
<i>我睡著了嗎? </i>

3276
01:42:49,446 --> 01:42:51,470
<i>我睡過了嗎? </i>

3277
01:42:51,614 --> 01:42:54,641
你不是一片美麗的, 獨一無二的雪花

3278
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,186
<i>這個房子活了起來</i>

3279
01:42:57,254 --> 01:43:01,885
<i>這麼多的人在裏面流汗, 呼吸</i>

3280
01:43:02,393 --> 01:43:04,987
<i>這麼多人移動, 房子也動了起來</i>

3281
01:43:07,865 --> 01:43:09,959
<i>泰勒星球</i>

3282
01:43:10,035 --> 01:43:12,094
<i>我得貼著牆壁走路</i>

3283
01:43:12,203 --> 01:43:15,296
<i>受困於在這幫太空猴子之間</i>

3284
01:43:15,406 --> 01:43:19,207
你不能在這抽煙
你知道這房子他媽的...

3285
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:21,802
<i>人們有組織的煮飯, 勞作, 睡覺</i>

3286
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:26,108
等一下

3287
01:43:45,037 --> 01:43:47,733
盡在掌控之中, 長官

3288
01:43:50,209 --> 01:43:52,040
泰勒在哪?

3289
01:43:52,111 --> 01:43:55,104
長官, "暴亂"計劃第一條規則是不能...

3290
01:43:55,215 --> 01:43:57,148
沒錯, 好吧

3291
01:43:59,552 --> 01:44:01,680
<i>我孑然一身</i>

3292
01:44:01,855 --> 01:44:05,484
<i>我父親拋棄了我, 泰勒拋棄了我</i>

3293
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:07,856
<i>我如傑克般心碎</i>

3294
01:44:12,065 --> 01:44:15,866
<i>"暴亂"計劃下一步是什麼, 只有泰勒知道</i>

3295
01:44:16,771 --> 01:44:19,967
<i>第二條規則是不能提問</i>

3296
01:44:22,777 --> 01:44:25,473
他媽的離我遠點, 離遠點

3297
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,939
這些是什麼人?

3298
01:44:33,187 --> 01:44:35,485
"報業大街肥皂公司"

3299
01:44:37,058 --> 01:44:39,118
我能進來嗎?

3300
01:44:42,263 --> 01:44:44,322
他不在這

3301
01:44:44,398 --> 01:44:46,663
什麼?

3302
01:44:47,703 --> 01:44:51,264
泰勒不在這

3303
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,399
泰勒離開了

3304
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:55,935
泰勒走了

3305
01:45:12,962 --> 01:45:14,691
過來幫忙

3306
01:45:25,842 --> 01:45:30,746
兩個被槍射傷的要進來
他媽的挪些空間出來

3307
01:45:30,815 --> 01:45:33,215
怎麼回事? 怎麼回事?

3308
01:45:33,317 --> 01:45:36,184
我們在執行任務, 我們本該一石二鳥的

3309
01:45:37,454 --> 01:45:39,547
毀掉一件藝術品...

3310
01:45:39,623 --> 01:45:42,148
開始行動, 上

3311
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:46,024
順便碾碎一個連鎖咖啡店

3312
01:45:52,437 --> 01:45:54,803
全部都是按計劃進行的, 長官

3313
01:46:02,981 --> 01:46:06,247
- 本來一切順利, 直到...
- 警察, 不許動

3314
01:46:06,352 --> 01:46:09,081
- 怎麼了?
- 他們向鮑伯開槍

3315
01:46:10,589 --> 01:46:13,024
- 他們打中了他的頭
- 那些傻逼豬頭!

3316
01:46:18,397 --> 01:46:20,422
哦, 天啊

3317
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:23,798
- 那幫傻逼
- 你們這幫白癡

3318
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:28,001
你們戴著面罩, 炸毀公物

3319
01:46:28,075 --> 01:46:30,770
還希望會怎麼樣?

3320
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:36,881
好吧, 快點, 清除證據
我們得處理掉屍體

3321
01:46:36,984 --> 01:46:39,851
- 埋了他
- 什麼?

3322
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,184
把他搬到花園, 埋了他

3323
01:46:42,256 --> 01:46:45,123
- 來吧, 各位, 動手吧
- 都他媽滾開

3324
01:46:45,225 --> 01:46:48,456
離他遠點, 你們在說什麼?

3325
01:46:48,528 --> 01:46:51,123
這不是他媽的什麼證據, 這是一個人

3326
01:46:51,232 --> 01:46:54,428
他是我的朋友, 你們不能把他埋在花園

3327
01:46:54,501 --> 01:46:57,494
他為"暴亂"計劃而捐軀, 長官

3328
01:46:57,605 --> 01:46:59,630
- 他是鮑伯
- 長官, 在...

3329
01:46:59,707 --> 01:47:01,834
在"暴亂"計劃中, 我們沒有名字

3330
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:03,900
現在, 聽我說

3331
01:47:04,011 --> 01:47:08,506
這是一個人, 他有名字
他叫羅伯特·鮑爾森, 明白嗎?

3332
01:47:08,616 --> 01:47:10,516
- 羅伯特·鮑爾森
- 他是一個人

3333
01:47:10,618 --> 01:47:13,452
他因為我們而死, 你明白嗎?

3334
01:47:14,123 --> 01:47:16,420
我明白

3335
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:22,028
"暴亂"計劃成員死後

3336
01:47:22,097 --> 01:47:24,156
會得到名字

3337
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:27,235
他的名字是羅伯特·鮑爾森

3338
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:29,763
他的名字是羅伯特·鮑爾森

3339
01:47:30,539 --> 01:47:33,235
他的名字是羅伯特·鮑爾森

3340
01:47:33,309 --> 01:47:37,143
他的名字是羅伯特·鮑爾森

3341
01:47:37,246 --> 01:47:40,306
拜託, 各位, 停下來

3342
01:47:40,382 --> 01:47:42,977
他的名字是羅伯特·鮑爾森

3343
01:47:43,086 --> 01:47:46,146
閉嘴, 都結束了

3344
01:47:49,392 --> 01:47:51,917
都他媽的滾出去

3345
01:48:20,624 --> 01:48:25,085
- 泰勒?
- 不, 我是縱火案組的斯特恩警探

3346
01:48:25,163 --> 01:48:26,721
我需要和你見面...

3347
01:48:31,236 --> 01:48:35,297
<i>我去了泰勒機票上的所有城市
他逛過的酒吧</i>

3348
01:48:35,374 --> 01:48:40,142
<i>我也不知道怎麼回事
我能找出50間不同的酒吧</i>

3349
01:48:40,213 --> 01:48:44,774
我在找泰勒·德頓
我有很重要的事情和他談

3350
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:46,543
I wish I could help you,

3351
01:48:46,618 --> 01:48:48,951
sir.

3352
01:48:54,226 --> 01:48:56,320
<i>每到一個城市</i>

3353
01:48:57,363 --> 01:48:59,763
<i>只要一下了飛機</i>

3354
01:49:00,366 --> 01:49:02,631
<i>我就能找到一家搏擊俱樂部</i>

3355
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:04,396
嘿! 嘿!

3356
01:49:05,471 --> 01:49:07,063
出租車

3357
01:49:07,173 --> 01:49:09,233
看看我的臉, 我也是其中一員

3358
01:49:09,343 --> 01:49:11,868
我就想知道你是否見過泰勒

3359
01:49:11,979 --> 01:49:15,641
我不能向你透露任何信息

3360
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:20,448
即使知道這個據點的信息, 我也不能夠...

3361
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:24,819
- 你是個白癡啊
- 我必須請你離開

3362
01:49:26,194 --> 01:49:31,222
<i>泰勒正忙於在全國擴張連鎖俱樂部</i>

3363
01:49:34,002 --> 01:49:38,439
<i>我睡了嗎? 我睡著了嗎? </i>

3364
01:49:38,506 --> 01:49:40,770
<i>泰勒是我的噩夢, 還是我是他的噩夢? </i>

3365
01:49:42,177 --> 01:49:45,237
- 我們剛聽到一個傳言
- 什麼傳言?

3366
01:49:45,313 --> 01:49:49,579
- 沒人知道他長什麼樣子
- 他每三年做一次整形手術

3367
01:49:49,651 --> 01:49:52,677
這是我聽過的最傻的事情

3368
01:49:52,787 --> 01:49:56,849
- 邁阿密搏擊俱樂部的事是真的嗎?
- 德頓先生正在組建一支軍隊?

3369
01:49:56,992 --> 01:49:59,983
<i>我活在一個永遠似曾相識的狀態之下</i>

3370
01:50:00,796 --> 01:50:02,855
<i>每到一處</i>

3371
01:50:02,998 --> 01:50:04,932
<i>我就覺得我之前到過那</i>

3372
01:50:05,034 --> 01:50:07,936
<i>就像是跟著一個隱形的人</i>

3373
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:11,097
<i>尋著血漿的氣味</i>

3374
01:50:11,207 --> 01:50:14,699
<i>骯髒, 凌亂的腳印</i>

3375
01:50:15,545 --> 01:50:18,742
<i>跟著猶如炸雞一般的味道</i>

3376
01:50:18,849 --> 01:50:22,409
<i>前晚搏擊後留在地板上的餘溫</i>

3377
01:50:23,286 --> 01:50:26,221
<i>我總是落後泰勒一步</i>

3378
01:50:29,126 --> 01:50:32,254
他的名字是羅伯特·鮑爾森

3379
01:50:36,867 --> 01:50:38,961
歡迎回來, 長官

3380
01:50:39,937 --> 01:50:42,030
你好嗎?

3381
01:50:42,106 --> 01:50:44,266
你認識我?

3382
01:50:44,341 --> 01:50:46,742
這是測試嗎, 長官?

3383
01:50:46,844 --> 01:50:48,709
不, 這不是測試

3384
01:50:48,779 --> 01:50:51,043
你上週四來過這

3385
01:50:51,582 --> 01:50:53,881
週四?

3386
01:50:53,985 --> 01:50:57,944
你就站在你現在的位置, 問我警備何如

3387
01:50:58,589 --> 01:51:00,683
固若金湯, 長官

3388
01:51:03,362 --> 01:51:05,522
你認為我是誰?

3389
01:51:05,596 --> 01:51:08,157
你確定不是在測試我嗎?

3390
01:51:08,267 --> 01:51:10,167
不, 這不是測試

3391
01:51:10,269 --> 01:51:12,328
你是德頓先生

3392
01:51:13,672 --> 01:51:16,334
你是給了我這個的人

3393
01:51:16,408 --> 01:51:20,606
<i>請繫好安全帶, 推回座椅靠背</i>

3394
01:51:32,091 --> 01:51:34,150
- 喂?
- 瑪拉, 是我

3395
01:51:34,227 --> 01:51:36,196
- 我們做過嗎?
- 做什麼?

3396
01:51:36,297 --> 01:51:37,628
我們做過愛嗎?

3397
01:51:37,731 --> 01:51:39,891
這算哪門子白癡問題?

3398
01:51:39,999 --> 01:51:42,365
白癡是因為做過還是沒做過

3399
01:51:42,435 --> 01:51:45,030
- 你在耍我嗎?
- 不是, 我要知道...

3400
01:51:45,139 --> 01:51:49,006
你想要知道我們是
在性交還是在做愛?

3401
01:51:49,108 --> 01:51:52,510
- 我們真的做愛了?
- 你打電話就為了問這個?

3402
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,413
回答問題就是了, 瑪拉, 我們做沒做過

3403
01:51:55,516 --> 01:51:58,418
你干了我, 然後甩了我
你愛過我, 你又厭惡我

3404
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:01,386
你一會兒感情豐富
一會兒又冷酷無情

3405
01:52:01,455 --> 01:52:04,151
這樣描述我倆的關係可以嗎, 泰勒?

3406
01:52:04,225 --> 01:52:06,319
<i>我猶如失重一般</i>

3407
01:52:06,394 --> 01:52:07,861
你剛才說什麼?

3408
01:52:07,963 --> 01:52:10,329
- 你什麼毛病?
- 你叫我什麼? 說我的名字!

3409
01:52:10,398 --> 01:52:14,061
泰勒·德頓! 泰勒·德頓!
你這個變態, 怎麼回事?

3410
01:52:14,169 --> 01:52:16,228
- 我馬上過去
- 我不在家

3411
01:52:16,338 --> 01:52:19,136
你違背了你的諾言

3412
01:52:19,207 --> 01:52:21,176
天啊, 泰勒!

3413
01:52:21,244 --> 01:52:24,679
- 你他媽的和她談論我
- 這他媽的是怎麼回事?

3414
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:28,238
我就要求你一件事, 一件簡單的事

3415
01:52:28,351 --> 01:52:30,649
為什麼大家都認為我是你?

3416
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:33,278
回答我!

3417
01:52:35,658 --> 01:52:37,489
坐下

3418
01:52:40,296 --> 01:52:42,993
回答我, 為什麼大家認為我是你?

3419
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:45,260
我認為你知道

3420
01:52:45,401 --> 01:52:47,961
- 不, 我不知道
- 是的, 你知道

3421
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:50,801
為什麼所有人都把你認成是我呢?

3422
01:52:50,874 --> 01:52:53,672
我不知道

3423
01:52:58,448 --> 01:53:01,315
- 你明白了
- 不會吧

3424
01:53:01,418 --> 01:53:03,511
說出來

3425
01:53:04,889 --> 01:53:06,913
因為...

3426
01:53:08,292 --> 01:53:09,452
說出來

3427
01:53:11,128 --> 01:53:13,188
因為我們是一個人

3428
01:53:13,264 --> 01:53:15,391
回答正確

3429
01:53:15,466 --> 01:53:17,626
<i>我們是手舞足蹈的一坨屎</i>

3430
01:53:17,701 --> 01:53:21,433
- 我不明白
- 你想要改變自己的生活

3431
01:53:21,506 --> 01:53:23,599
但你一個人卻做不來

3432
01:53:23,675 --> 01:53:25,734
一切你所希望成為的

3433
01:53:25,843 --> 01:53:27,708
就是我

3434
01:53:27,812 --> 01:53:30,940
我長的像你希望的樣子
我干逼像你希望的樣子

3435
01:53:31,049 --> 01:53:33,415
我聰明, 能幹, 最重要的是

3436
01:53:33,484 --> 01:53:36,249
我自由自在, 而你卻相反

3437
01:53:36,322 --> 01:53:37,311
哦, 不

3438
01:53:37,423 --> 01:53:40,323
- 泰勒不在這, 泰勒離開了
- 什麼?

3439
01:53:40,425 --> 01:53:42,724
這不可能, 這太瘋狂了

3440
01:53:42,828 --> 01:53:44,853
人們每天都這麼做

3441
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:48,492
他們和自己說話, 他們把自己看成希望的樣子

3442
01:53:48,568 --> 01:53:51,832
不過他們沒有勇氣像你一樣表現出來

3443
01:53:55,642 --> 01:53:58,975
你還再跟自己較勁, 所以有時你還是你

3444
01:53:59,112 --> 01:54:03,776
- 我們有時間應該再打一場
- 一直以來, 你想像在看著我

3445
01:54:03,883 --> 01:54:06,374
如果這是你第一次來, 必須打一場

3446
01:54:06,486 --> 01:54:10,856
漸漸地, 你讓自己成為...

3447
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:13,591
泰勒·德頓

3448
01:54:13,693 --> 01:54:16,491
你的工作, 你有多少錢不能代表你

3449
01:54:16,563 --> 01:54:18,964
- 不對, 你有一間房子
- 以你的名字租的

3450
01:54:19,066 --> 01:54:22,694
- 你有自己的工作和完整的生活
- 你晚上工作, 因為你睡不著

3451
01:54:22,769 --> 01:54:24,566
是你半夜起來, 製作肥皂

3452
01:54:24,671 --> 01:54:29,609
- 你干了瑪拉, 泰勒
- 嚴格地說, 你干了瑪拉, 對她來說都一樣

3453
01:54:31,345 --> 01:54:33,371
哦, 我的天

3454
01:54:34,382 --> 01:54:36,475
你看我們左右為難了

3455
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:38,814
她知道的太多了

3456
01:54:38,919 --> 01:54:44,017
我想我們應該討論一下
如何讓我們的目標一致

3457
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,285
你什麼意思?

3458
01:54:47,229 --> 01:54:51,495
這些都是屁話, 我不要聽

3459
01:54:51,566 --> 01:54:54,228
- 你瘋了
- 不, 是你瘋了

3460
01:54:54,337 --> 01:54:57,032
我們沒時間說這些廢話了

3461
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:00,735
<i>這就叫轉折點</i>

3462
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:02,903
<i>電影繼續</i>

3463
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:06,107
<i>但觀眾不知道發生了什麼</i>

3464
01:55:19,061 --> 01:55:22,758
- 先生, 你要退房嗎?
- 是的, 結賬

3465
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:25,267
能告訴我你最後撥出的幾個號碼嗎?

3466
01:55:29,672 --> 01:55:33,734
- 這些是什麼時候打的?
- 今天凌晨兩點到三點半之間

3467
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:43,679
<i>我是不是越來越早上床, 起床卻越來越晚? </i>

3468
01:55:43,787 --> 01:55:48,657
<i>是不是我當泰勒的時間越來越長? </i>

3469
01:55:51,161 --> 01:55:53,596
有人在嗎?

3470
01:55:56,267 --> 01:55:58,360
<i>再一次似曾相識</i>

3471
01:56:00,004 --> 01:56:02,495
只要做出足夠的肥皂, 你想炸什麼都行

3472
01:56:04,843 --> 01:56:06,902
哦, 我的天啊

3473
01:56:10,816 --> 01:56:13,181
- 1888號
- 你是誰?

3474
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:17,282
富蘭克林, 1888號, 這是主機, 你好?

3475
01:56:18,457 --> 01:56:20,049
你好?

3476
01:56:20,125 --> 01:56:22,252
富蘭克林街, 1888號?

3477
01:56:22,328 --> 01:56:24,421
是的, 有什麼可以忙你的?

3478
01:56:26,866 --> 01:56:29,460
- 你好?
- 對, 對

3479
01:56:29,535 --> 01:56:32,061
我要立刻和你的經理說話

3480
01:56:32,138 --> 01:56:34,264
- 請講
- 好的, 聽我說

3481
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:37,504
你的大樓裏將會發生很恐怖的事情

3482
01:56:37,611 --> 01:56:39,670
盡在掌控之中, 長官

3483
01:56:40,113 --> 01:56:43,674
- 你說什麼?
- 不用擔心我們, 長官, 我們很堅定

3484
01:56:47,921 --> 01:56:49,286
2160號

3485
01:56:56,897 --> 01:56:59,423
瑪拉! 瑪拉! 嘿, 等一下!

3486
01:57:01,102 --> 01:57:03,900
等一下, 我有話要和你說
瑪拉! 瑪拉!

3487
01:57:03,971 --> 01:57:08,135
你的那些光頭變態竟然用掃把打我
他們差點打斷了我的胳膊

3488
01:57:08,276 --> 01:57:10,972
他們用堿液燒自己的指尖
真是莫名其妙!

3489
01:57:11,078 --> 01:57:15,038
這對你來說很難接受, 但你聽我說完

3490
01:57:15,117 --> 01:57:19,075
- 無非是你那些屁話
- 倒是比那容易接受

3491
01:57:22,324 --> 01:57:24,884
我不要聽你說話

3492
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,087
你完全有權利...

3493
01:57:27,696 --> 01:57:29,561
我就要一杯咖啡, 謝謝

3494
01:57:29,665 --> 01:57:32,600
你點的東西都免費, 先生

3495
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:34,726
為什麼免費?

3496
01:57:34,803 --> 01:57:36,863
- 不要問
- 隨便吧

3497
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:42,468
我要蛤蜊湯, 炸雞, 烤土豆和巧克力奶油派

3498
01:57:42,544 --> 01:57:44,604
乾淨的食物, 拜託

3499
01:57:44,714 --> 01:57:47,740
那樣的話, 我建議你不要蛤蜊湯

3500
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:49,910
不要蛤蜊湯, 謝謝你

3501
01:57:51,387 --> 01:57:53,617
你有30秒

3502
01:57:56,326 --> 01:57:58,818
我知道我的舉止非常怪異, 好嗎?

3503
01:57:58,929 --> 01:58:02,364
- 我也知道我來起來有兩面...
- 兩面?

3504
01:58:02,432 --> 01:58:07,496
- 你就是吉基爾博士和混蛋先生
- 我知道, 但是我意識到一些很重要的事情

3505
01:58:07,571 --> 01:58:11,632
- 什麼?
- 我們之間的關係不明不白

3506
01:58:11,742 --> 01:58:14,108
我也說不清楚, 但重要的是...

3507
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:16,772
- 我知道我待你不好
- 無所謂了

3508
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:19,577
不, 不, 就給我15秒, 求你了

3509
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:21,949
15秒之內, 你不要張嘴說話

3510
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:24,112
我要告訴你我很抱歉

3511
01:58:24,188 --> 01:58:28,523
我所意識到的是
我真的喜歡你, 瑪拉

3512
01:58:28,593 --> 01:58:30,720
真的嗎?

3513
01:58:30,795 --> 01:58:32,660
真的

3514
01:58:32,764 --> 01:58:37,064
我在乎你, 我不希望因為我
你發生什麼意外

3515
01:58:37,168 --> 01:58:39,932
瑪拉, 你有生命危險

3516
01:58:40,005 --> 01:58:41,939
什麼?

3517
01:58:42,007 --> 01:58:45,738
你得離開城市一段時間, 離開大城市

3518
01:58:45,810 --> 01:58:48,608
- 去野營好了...
- 你這人有神經病

3519
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:52,139
- 不, 你被我連累了
- 不, 你閉嘴

3520
01:58:52,218 --> 01:58:54,778
- 你不安全
- 閉嘴!

3521
01:58:56,589 --> 01:59:01,026
- 聽著, 我盡力了, 泰勒, 我真的盡力了
- 我知道你盡力了

3522
01:59:01,093 --> 01:59:04,154
你有很多我喜歡的地方, 你聰明, 你風趣

3523
01:59:04,231 --> 01:59:06,199
你床上功夫一流

3524
01:59:06,266 --> 01:59:07,698
但是...

3525
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,859
你讓我受不了

3526
01:59:09,969 --> 01:59:12,461
你有嚴重的精神問題

3527
01:59:12,572 --> 01:59:16,508
非常嚴重的問題
你應該去尋求專業治療

3528
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:20,569
- 我知道, 我很抱歉
- 你抱歉, 我也抱歉, 大家都抱歉

3529
01:59:21,715 --> 01:59:23,808
我不能再和你交往了

3530
01:59:23,884 --> 01:59:25,977
我不能

3531
01:59:26,053 --> 01:59:28,113
我也不會了

3532
01:59:28,222 --> 01:59:30,246
我要走了

3533
01:59:30,323 --> 01:59:33,019
你不能走, 瑪拉, 你不安全

3534
01:59:35,863 --> 01:59:38,525
- 瑪拉, 你不明白
- 不要碰我

3535
01:59:38,633 --> 01:59:41,124
- 瑪拉, 我在保護你
- 放開我

3536
01:59:41,235 --> 01:59:44,227
- 我不想再見到你了
- 沒關係, 只要...

3537
01:59:44,305 --> 01:59:46,432
等一下

3538
01:59:50,312 --> 01:59:52,871
在這等一下, 安靜

3539
01:59:52,947 --> 01:59:55,074
拿上這些錢, 上車去

3540
01:59:55,149 --> 01:59:57,311
我向你保證以後不會再煩你

3541
01:59:57,453 --> 01:59:58,886
安靜

3542
01:59:58,954 --> 02:00:02,151
求你上車去, 求你上車去

3543
02:00:03,325 --> 02:00:05,452
你這是在幹嘛?

3544
02:00:05,527 --> 02:00:09,623
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

3545
02:00:09,698 --> 02:00:14,067
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

3546
02:00:14,136 --> 02:00:18,540
- 好吧, 記著, 千萬別去大城市, 離開這幾天
- 泰勒...

3547
02:00:20,076 --> 02:00:22,909
你是我一生中遇到的最槽糕的人

3548
02:00:37,927 --> 02:00:40,590
你好, 我要自首

3549
02:00:40,698 --> 02:00:43,462
我是一個恐怖組織的首腦

3550
02:00:43,534 --> 02:00:48,494
我組織策劃了, 這個城市發生的
大量的公共破壞和人身襲擊事件

3551
02:00:48,572 --> 02:00:52,474
（審訊室B, 使用中）
在大城市地區, 我們擁有大概200名成員

3552
02:00:52,543 --> 02:00:56,344
分會已經發展到了其他五六個大城市

3553
02:00:56,515 --> 02:00:59,540
這是一個嚴密管理的組織

3554
02:00:59,617 --> 02:01:05,215
下設很多單位可以獨立行動, 無需領導

3555
02:01:05,323 --> 02:01:09,191
你們去那房子查查, 報業大街, 1537號

3556
02:01:09,294 --> 02:01:11,194
那是我們的總部

3557
02:01:11,296 --> 02:01:13,890
在房後, 花園裏面

3558
02:01:13,965 --> 02:01:16,992
你們會找到羅伯特·鮑爾森的屍體

3559
02:01:17,103 --> 02:01:20,401
在地下室, 你們會發現很多澡盆

3560
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:25,842
最近在那裏製造出了大量的炸藥

3561
02:01:25,945 --> 02:01:27,970
I believe the plan is to blow up

3562
02:01:28,047 --> 02:01:31,141
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

3563
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:33,310
and the TRW building.

3564
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:37,620
為什麼是這些大樓?
為什麼是信用卡公司?

3565
02:01:37,723 --> 02:01:41,318
如果所有的債務記錄都被清零
那麼所有一切將化為烏有

3566
02:01:42,161 --> 02:01:44,220
一切將陷入混亂

3567
02:01:45,833 --> 02:01:49,064
讓他說下去, 我去打個電話

3568
02:01:59,646 --> 02:02:01,877
我真的對你五體投地

3569
02:02:02,350 --> 02:02:04,408
什麼?

3570
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:06,576
下這種命令需要很大的勇氣

3571
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,417
你是個天才, 長官

3572
02:02:08,556 --> 02:02:13,255
你說過無論是誰要妨礙"暴動"計劃
即便是你本人

3573
02:02:13,361 --> 02:02:15,693
我們也要取下他的蛋蛋

3574
02:02:17,098 --> 02:02:20,261
- 反抗也沒用
- 你真的很堅強, 德頓先生

3575
02:02:20,368 --> 02:02:23,395
- 為我們樹立了榜樣
- 你們這麼做是完全錯誤的

3576
02:02:23,472 --> 02:02:26,304
- 你說過你會這麼說的
- 我不是泰勒·德頓

3577
02:02:26,407 --> 02:02:30,276
- 你也告訴我們你會說這個
- 那好吧, 我是泰勒·德頓

3578
02:02:30,379 --> 02:02:33,075
聽著, 我向你們下達直接命令

3579
02:02:33,182 --> 02:02:37,312
- 我現在要取消行動計劃
- 你囑咐過你一定會這麼說的

3580
02:02:43,459 --> 02:02:47,021
你們都瘋了嗎?
你們可是警察

3581
02:02:47,863 --> 02:02:49,922
要不要試試這個?

3582
02:02:50,099 --> 02:02:53,069
把嘴閉上

3583
02:02:53,136 --> 02:02:55,229
媽的

3584
02:02:57,874 --> 02:03:00,672
一些信息得到了證實

3585
02:03:00,744 --> 02:03:04,043
- 我們到報業大街的房子去看看
- 馬上就到

3586
02:03:04,748 --> 02:03:06,512
嘿, 等等

3587
02:03:07,218 --> 02:03:09,742
- 我抓到他了
- 先生, 例行公事

3588
02:03:09,853 --> 02:03:12,321
- 別掙扎了
- 橡皮筋呢?

3589
02:03:12,422 --> 02:03:14,914
離我遠點, 把刀放下

3590
02:03:18,462 --> 02:03:21,898
退後, 馬上給我趴下

3591
02:03:23,134 --> 02:03:25,159
趴在地上

3592
02:03:29,942 --> 02:03:32,842
The first person
that comes out of this door

3593
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:34,878
gets a lead salad! Understand?

3594
02:03:59,205 --> 02:04:01,799
走開, 讓開

3595
02:04:14,755 --> 02:04:16,813
<i>我一直跑</i>

3596
02:04:17,357 --> 02:04:21,522
<i>跑到肌肉燃燒, 體酸翻滾</i>

3597
02:04:24,164 --> 02:04:26,222
<i>然後接著跑</i>

3598
02:05:06,942 --> 02:05:09,240
你他媽的在幹啥?

3599
02:05:09,345 --> 02:05:12,280
穿著內褲亂跑, 你瘋啦

3600
02:05:12,381 --> 02:05:15,475
不, 我弄清楚你了
我知道將會發生什麼

3601
02:05:15,584 --> 02:05:20,488
拜託, 我找到一個看戲的好地方
那兒就像是劇場的前排

3602
02:06:08,473 --> 02:06:11,136
- 哦, 老天爺
- 你現在這又是幹嘛?

3603
02:06:11,243 --> 02:06:14,610
- 我要阻止這一切
- 為啥?

3604
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:18,081
- 這可是你所做的最偉大的事情
- 不, 我不能讓這種事發生

3605
02:06:18,150 --> 02:06:21,415
其他十幢大樓裏面還有十個炸彈

3606
02:06:21,487 --> 02:06:23,853
媽的, 從什麼時候開始
"暴動"計劃變成謀殺了?

3607
02:06:23,922 --> 02:06:25,914
大樓都是空的, 警衛都是我們的人

3608
02:06:26,025 --> 02:06:28,857
我們不會殺死任何人
我們在解放他們

3609
02:06:28,927 --> 02:06:31,691
鮑伯死了, 他們用槍打爆了他的頭

3610
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:35,164
你想要做煎蛋, 就得弄碎幾個雞蛋

3611
02:06:35,268 --> 02:06:38,862
不, 我不會聽你說的, 你根本就不存在

3612
02:06:44,911 --> 02:06:49,280
我要是你就不會這麼做
除非你知道這些線都是管什麼的

3613
02:06:49,349 --> 02:06:51,078
如果你知道, 我就會知道

3614
02:06:56,690 --> 02:07:01,058
或者, 也可能我知道你會知道
所以我花了整天時間想辦法接錯了

3615
02:07:09,571 --> 02:07:10,662
你說呢?

3616
02:07:12,673 --> 02:07:14,766
哦, 天啊, 不對, 不是綠色的那條

3617
02:07:15,609 --> 02:07:18,602
最好不要扯綠色的那條

3618
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:25,979
我說了不要這麼做

3619
02:07:27,822 --> 02:07:29,380
我日

3620
02:07:30,325 --> 02:07:32,418
泰勒, 離那車遠點

3621
02:07:34,629 --> 02:07:38,030
泰勒, 我沒開玩笑, 離那車遠點

3622
02:07:38,133 --> 02:07:39,499
可惡

3623
02:07:45,841 --> 02:07:47,206
好吧

3624
02:07:47,310 --> 02:07:50,643
你要對著你的知己好友開槍

3625
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:53,341
旁邊還放著400加侖的炸藥

3626
02:07:55,551 --> 02:07:57,314
冷靜, 泰勒

3627
02:08:10,534 --> 02:08:12,593
拜託

3628
02:08:12,669 --> 02:08:14,728
不要走

3629
02:08:52,311 --> 02:08:53,505
幹嘛?

3630
02:09:38,993 --> 02:09:39,687
三分鐘後

3631
02:09:40,628 --> 02:09:42,926
就是這樣

3632
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:45,055
原點

3633
02:09:45,132 --> 02:09:47,100
一切清零

3634
02:09:47,168 --> 02:09:49,466
<i>這想這就是故事開始的地方</i>

3635
02:09:49,537 --> 02:09:52,029
想說點什麼來紀念這個時刻嗎?

3636
02:09:52,107 --> 02:09:55,132
I'm sorry?

3637
02:09:55,242 --> 02:09:57,301
我還是什麼都想不出

3638
02:09:59,348 --> 02:10:01,441
重演幽默片段啊

3639
02:10:06,521 --> 02:10:08,546
越來越刺激了

3640
02:10:10,125 --> 02:10:11,922
還有兩分半鍾

3641
02:10:11,993 --> 02:10:14,554
想想我們所成就的一切吧, 哥們兒

3642
02:10:14,664 --> 02:10:19,464
通過這些窗戶, 我們將見證金融時代的終結

3643
02:10:19,534 --> 02:10:23,266
向經濟大同又邁進了一步

3644
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:39,219
她來這幹嘛?

3645
02:10:39,322 --> 02:10:41,222
怎麼能忘了她呢

3646
02:10:41,324 --> 02:10:44,385
放我下來, 你這個禿瓢混蛋

3647
02:10:44,495 --> 02:10:47,589
- 我求你, 不要這麼做
- 不是我做的

3648
02:10:47,698 --> 02:10:51,156
- 是我們一起做的, 這是我們想要的
- 不對

3649
02:10:51,235 --> 02:10:55,968
- 不, 我不想要這些
- 沒錯, 但現在你已經無所謂了

3650
02:10:56,039 --> 02:11:00,033
- 我們必須把你忘掉
- 你不過是我腦中的聲音

3651
02:11:00,145 --> 02:11:02,203
你只是我腦中的聲音

3652
02:11:02,312 --> 02:11:05,146
- 你他媽不過是幻覺, 為什麼我擺脫不了你?
- 因為你需要我

3653
02:11:05,216 --> 02:11:07,309
不, 不需要, 我不再需要你了

3654
02:11:07,385 --> 02:11:11,652
是你創造了我, 我是不會為了好過一點
而創造出你這種孬種的

3655
02:11:11,757 --> 02:11:15,715
- 負點責任吧
- 我有啊, 我會為這一切負責的

3656
02:11:15,827 --> 02:11:17,556
我會接受這一切

3657
02:11:17,629 --> 02:11:21,657
拜託, 我求求你, 罷手吧

3658
02:11:23,668 --> 02:11:25,863
我讓我們失望過嗎?

3659
02:11:27,339 --> 02:11:29,637
因為我, 你強大了多少?

3660
02:11:35,548 --> 02:11:37,607
我會照顧我們的

3661
02:11:37,683 --> 02:11:41,484
跟以前一樣, 我帶著你瘋癲狂躁

3662
02:11:41,588 --> 02:11:44,022
到最後你還是會感激我的

3663
02:11:44,491 --> 02:11:47,015
泰勒, 泰勒

3664
02:11:47,092 --> 02:11:50,620
我感激你, 感激你為我做的一切

3665
02:11:50,697 --> 02:11:53,393
但這已經過火了, 我不想要這樣

3666
02:11:53,467 --> 02:11:58,769
那你想要什麼, 回去幹爛工作?
住回爛公寓, 看爛電視劇?

3667
02:11:58,839 --> 02:12:00,898
去你媽的, 我才不要那些

3668
02:12:01,775 --> 02:12:05,610
- 不能這樣
- 已經這樣了, 閉嘴吧

3669
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:07,306
60秒倒計時

3670
02:12:07,848 --> 02:12:09,907
不

3671
02:12:11,819 --> 02:12:14,617
我能搞定的, 這不是真的

3672
02:12:14,689 --> 02:12:18,386
你不是真的, 那把槍...
那把槍根本不在你手上

3673
02:12:19,861 --> 02:12:21,920
槍是在我的手上

3674
02:12:26,935 --> 02:12:29,425
幹得不錯, 但已經於事無補了

3675
02:12:38,313 --> 02:12:40,941
你幹嘛把槍頂著自己的頭?

3676
02:12:41,083 --> 02:12:43,142
不是我的頭, 泰勒

3677
02:12:43,719 --> 02:12:45,744
我們的頭

3678
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:49,349
有意思

3679
02:12:52,361 --> 02:12:55,024
你打算怎麼著, 宜家小子?

3680
02:13:01,503 --> 02:13:04,496
嘿, 這可是你我之間的事

3681
02:13:07,243 --> 02:13:09,303
朋友?

3682
02:13:10,147 --> 02:13:12,240
泰勒

3683
02:13:15,652 --> 02:13:17,985
我要你認真聽我說

3684
02:13:18,122 --> 02:13:20,556
好吧

3685
02:13:20,658 --> 02:13:22,717
我不會退縮

3686
02:13:41,479 --> 02:13:43,504
什麼味道?

3687
02:14:03,135 --> 02:14:06,127
- 大家都哪去了?
- 哦, 不, 這是怎麼回事?

3688
02:14:06,772 --> 02:14:08,364
德頓先生

3689
02:14:09,442 --> 02:14:11,307
哦, 我的天啊

3690
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:19,846
你... 你沒事吧, 長官

3691
02:14:19,952 --> 02:14:23,912
- 哦耶, 我沒事
- 你看起來很槽糕, 長官, 發生什麼了?

3692
02:14:23,991 --> 02:14:27,984
- 沒什麼, 沒問題了
- 不, 不, 不, 先生, 他說得沒錯

3693
02:14:28,061 --> 02:14:30,825
- 你看起來很慘, 你需要馬上治療
- 我沒事

3694
02:14:30,964 --> 02:14:34,559
聽著, 我沒事, 什麼事都沒有

3695
02:14:36,837 --> 02:14:39,068
住手

3696
02:14:39,207 --> 02:14:42,334
- 放開她
- 老天爺啊

3697
02:14:42,409 --> 02:14:44,206
你...

3698
02:14:44,277 --> 02:14:46,371
嗨, 瑪拉

3699
02:14:46,848 --> 02:14:51,682
- 把她留在這, 東西收好, 我們樓下見
- 你確定嗎?

3700
02:14:51,786 --> 02:14:53,845
對, 我確定

3701
02:14:54,956 --> 02:14:59,052
你個傻逼, 你有什麼毛病啊
竟然他媽的搞出這種事情!

3702
02:14:59,194 --> 02:15:01,856
把我... 哦, 我的天, 你的臉

3703
02:15:01,964 --> 02:15:03,453
對, 我知道

3704
02:15:08,237 --> 02:15:10,102
發生什麼了?

3705
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:12,366
- 什麼都不要問
- 你中槍了

3706
02:15:12,441 --> 02:15:14,500
- 沒錯, 我中槍了
- 哦, 我的天啊

3707
02:15:15,444 --> 02:15:18,470
- 不敢相信他還能站著
- 真他媽的強悍

3708
02:15:22,285 --> 02:15:24,116
是誰幹的?

3709
02:15:24,253 --> 02:15:26,721
我自己幹的

3710
02:15:26,822 --> 02:15:28,882
幫我找些紗布

3711
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:32,285
你向自己開槍?

3712
02:15:32,395 --> 02:15:35,023
是的, 沒事的
瑪拉, 看著我

3713
02:15:35,098 --> 02:15:37,396
我真的沒事

3714
02:15:37,467 --> 02:15:41,426
相信我, 一切都會好的

3715
02:15:54,251 --> 02:15:58,119
你在我人生最為詭異的時候遇到了我
