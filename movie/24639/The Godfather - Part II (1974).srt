1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,074
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

1
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,903
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,907
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:12,368
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,713
My son...

5
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,427
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:19,727
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,521
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:25,816
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:30,529
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:33,199
He never speaks.

11
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,868
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:41,499
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:44,585
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:48,631
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:59,683
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,815
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,442
He's all I have left.

18
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:13,823
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:26,877
Move and I'll kill him!

20
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:29,004
Run, Vito!

21
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:35,886
Kill him!

22
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:49,650
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

23
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,821
You understand?

24
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:07,585
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

25
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:36,238
Vito, we're praying for you!

26
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:45,289
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

27
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:47,917
...turn him over to us.

28
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:51,420
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

29
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:56,425
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

30
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:12,483
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

31
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:47,495
Nurse.

32
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:15,356
Money?

33
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:18,484
Interpreter!

34
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,076
Where are you from?

35
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:30,412
- What is your name?
- Maria.

36
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:36,210
What is your name?

37
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:40,422
Come on, son. What is your name?

38
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,804
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

39
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:50,182
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

40
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,227
Okay, over there.

41
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,188
Next.

42
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:09,201
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

43
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:20,421
Vito Corleone!

44
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:23,507
Vito Corleone!

45
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,720
Here he is. This is him.

46
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,454
Did you bring the car keys?

47
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,125
Laurie! Laurie!

48
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,522
Mama!

49
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,442
Mama!

50
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,113
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

51
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:54,533
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

52
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,287
Mama!

53
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:03,334
- Here I am.
- Constanzia, after one week?

54
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:07,379
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

55
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:13,511
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

56
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:16,889
- What is this?
- You remember Merle?

57
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,767
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

58
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:25,064
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

59
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,817
You go see your children first.

60
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:33,614
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

61
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,746
Ladies and gentlemen...

62
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:45,167
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

63
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:49,338
Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.

64
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:52,299
And there is Mrs Geary.

65
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:04,728
Thank you very much.

66
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:12,027
This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs Geary.

67
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:15,281
We see Nevada far too seldom.

68
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:20,411
But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends,

69
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:24,373
and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.

70
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:31,422
And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.

71
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:37,928
I have here in my hand a cheque
made out to the university,

72
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:42,933
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of...

73
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,979
...Anthony Vito Corleone.

74
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:51,275
The cheque is signed by
that young man's parents,

75
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:54,236
whom I think we should recognise.

76
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:58,616
Mike, Pat, Kay - stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!

77
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:00,951
Folks, I want you to join me

78
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,916
in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr and Mrs Michael Corleone!

79
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,927
We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir,

80
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:24,350
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement

81
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:28,521
to honour their host,
Mr Michael Corleone.

82
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,231
Boys.

83
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,833
The plaque.

84
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,585
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

85
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,588
Okay, that's good.

86
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:58,801
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs Corleone.

87
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:23,284
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

88
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:26,579
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

89
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,874
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

90
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:36,505
I thought that you and I
would talk alone.

91
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:43,220
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

92
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:46,682
Well, it's perfectly all right with me,

93
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:51,562
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

94
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:57,067
Maybe more frankly than anyone in my
position has ever talked to you before.

95
00:16:57,276 --> 00:17:00,237
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

96
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:05,451
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas,

97
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:10,080
and one in Reno.
The licences were grandfathered in,

98
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,667
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

99
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:18,547
Now my sources tell me

100
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:22,510
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

101
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:27,598
They tell me that, within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

102
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,521
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

103
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:39,151
The licence will still be
in Klingman's name.

104
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:45,074
- Turnbull is a good man.
- Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

105
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:50,746
I don't want to spend more time here
than I have to. You can have the licence.

106
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:53,374
The price is 250,000 dollars.

107
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:56,460
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly,

108
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:01,132
of all four hotels, Mr Corleone.

109
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,598
The price for the licence
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

110
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,059
That's right.

111
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:17,690
- Why would I pay more than that?
- Because I intend to squeeze you.

112
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,443
I don't like your kind of people.

113
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:25,823
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair,

114
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,492
dressed up in those silk suits

115
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:32,538
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

116
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:38,294
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

117
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:43,924
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

118
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:53,267
Senator...

119
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:57,396
...we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

120
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:02,443
But never think it applies to my family.

121
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,321
All right, all right.

122
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:11,410
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

123
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:17,750
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

124
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:22,797
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

125
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:26,133
Don't you contact me again, ever.

126
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:30,179
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

127
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:34,683
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

128
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,272
My offer is this:

129
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:41,982
Nothing.

130
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:49,323
Not even the fee for the gaming licence,
which I would like you to put up.

131
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:56,997
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

132
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,378
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

133
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:05,631
- Honey, we have to go.
- Really? I'm sorry.

134
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,135
- It's been delightful.
- It was our pleasure.

135
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,887
It was wonderful talking to you.

136
00:20:56,223 --> 00:21:01,520
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

137
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:06,901
Frank Pentangeli! I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

138
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:10,654
I've got to check on my boys.

139
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,741
- What's with the food here?
- What's the matter?

140
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:19,747
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says "canapés".

141
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:25,127
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

142
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:31,342
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

143
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:35,304
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

144
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,894
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

145
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:47,983
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

146
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:51,237
No, that was no heart attack.

147
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:55,157
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

148
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:58,494
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

149
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:04,041
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

150
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,754
- You can't get in to see Mike?
- He's got me waiting in a lobby!

151
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,177
- Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

152
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,021
- Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
- I remember Tom from the old days.

153
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,731
Rocco...

154
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,986
- What's this?
- It's an orange from Miami.

155
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:36,824
Take care of Johnny's men. They look
like they might be hungry. Johnny?

156
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:43,456
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

157
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:46,208
Sure, Mike.

158
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:53,883
- What are you drinking, Johnny?
- Anisette.

159
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:04,226
- If you need anything, I'll be outside.
- Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

160
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:13,527
- I just left Mr Roth in Miami.
- How is his health?

161
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:16,280
It's not good.

162
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:19,408
Can I do anything or send anything?

163
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:24,455
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

164
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:26,123
That casino...

165
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:31,837
Registered owners: Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

166
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:36,926
The real owners are the old Lakeville
Road group and our friend in Miami.

167
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:43,307
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

168
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:47,603
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

169
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:54,819
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

170
00:23:55,861 --> 00:23:59,698
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

171
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:04,995
One by one, our old friends are gone.

172
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:08,541
Death - natural or not,

173
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,502
prison, deported...

174
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,134
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

175
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:25,724
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

176
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,602
Let's have a tarantella!

177
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:36,318
You! Up, up, up!

178
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:47,246
<i>Questa mano!</i>

179
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:50,416
<i>Questa mano!</i>

180
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:59,425
What the hell have we here?

181
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:15,608
- I'll see my sister alone.
- It concerns me too. May I stay?

182
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:20,279
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

183
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:23,616
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink?

184
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:30,080
Al, please get him a drink!

185
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:36,086
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on the Queen.

186
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,964
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

187
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:42,384
We're getting married first.

188
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:54,563
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

189
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:59,318
You see your children on weekends.

190
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:04,365
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

191
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:07,785
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

192
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:10,412
- You're not my father!
- So why come to me?

193
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:12,039
I need money.

194
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,930
Connie, Connie, Connie...

195
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,064
I want to be reasonable with you.

196
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:40,818
Why don't you stay with the family?

197
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,947
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

198
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:48,784
You won't be deprived of anything.

199
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:58,335
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

200
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:04,967
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him anymore.

201
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:07,511
He'll understand, believe me.

202
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:17,646
Connie.

203
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:23,778
If you don't listen to me,
and marry this man...

204
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,493
...you'll disappoint me.

205
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:06,237
- <i>Famiglia!</i>
- <i>Cent' anni!</i>

206
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:08,948
What's "Chen dannay"?

207
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,992
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.

208
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:16,413
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

209
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:20,543
- It would be true if my father were alive.
- Connie.

210
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:22,128
Hey...

211
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:25,965
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law
Deanna.

212
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,967
- Fredo's wife.
- My pleasure.

213
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:42,731
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

214
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:44,942
I know, I know.

215
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:20,227
- I just want to dance!
- You're falling all over the floor.

216
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:24,148
You're just jealous
because he's a real man!

217
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:29,028
- I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
- You couldn't belt your mama!

218
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,990
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

219
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:38,120
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

220
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:41,123
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop.

221
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:46,754
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

222
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:52,760
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

223
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:54,303
Fredo!

224
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:59,308
- I can't control her, Mikey.
- You're my brother, don't apologise.

225
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:06,899
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

226
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:10,111
- You took over and didn't give it to them.
- I welched.

227
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,740
Clemenza promised them <i>lu cazzo.</i>
He promised them nothing.

228
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:20,079
- He hated them more than I do.
- Frankie, they feel cheated.

229
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,459
You're sitting up in the Sierra
Mountains and you're drinking...

230
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:28,003
- What's he drinking?
- Champagne.

231
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:33,217
...Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgement on how I run my family.

232
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:37,388
Your family's still called Corleone.

233
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:41,517
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

234
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:45,646
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

235
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:47,773
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

236
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:50,443
...with Hyman Roth!

237
00:30:55,698 --> 00:31:00,119
You're a good old man, and I like you.

238
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:02,997
You were loyal to my father for years.

239
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:08,627
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

240
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:15,843
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

241
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:18,929
I know. That's why I don't want
them touched.

242
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:22,767
- Not touched?
- No, I want you to be fair with them.

243
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:27,980
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

244
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:33,903
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

245
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:38,073
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighbourhoods!

246
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:44,330
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!

247
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:47,291
And they leave the gambling to last.

248
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,713
I want to run my family without you on
my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

249
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:55,716
- No.
- <i>Morte.</i>

250
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:05,935
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

251
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:11,982
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

252
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:19,240
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

253
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:24,245
Your father did business with Hyman
Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

254
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:27,123
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

255
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:31,043
or his Sicilian messenger boy
Johnny Ola.

256
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:36,924
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

257
00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:44,014
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

258
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,267
Don Corleone.

259
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,727
Cicci, the door...

260
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:59,613
You want him to leave now?

261
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:05,619
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

262
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:09,206
The old man had too much wine.

263
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:15,796
It's late.

264
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,685
How's the baby?

265
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:34,023
- Sleeping inside me.
- Does it feel like a boy?

266
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:37,359
Yes, it does, Michael.

267
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:41,530
Kay?

268
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:45,868
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

269
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:48,370
It couldn't be helped, though.

270
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:52,374
It made me think of what you
once told me.

271
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:58,005
"In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate."

272
00:33:58,255 --> 00:34:01,133
That was seven years ago.

273
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:07,431
I know. I'm trying, darling.

274
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:13,664
Did you see this?

275
00:35:27,303 --> 00:35:29,346
Why are the drapes open?

276
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:59,376
Kay, are you all right?

277
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:02,213
- Are you hit?
- No.

278
00:36:04,048 --> 00:36:06,258
It's all right.

279
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:10,638
Stop! Stop!

280
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:14,058
Halt!

281
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:28,322
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

282
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:30,574
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

283
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,827
Alive!

284
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:35,329
Stay by the door.

285
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:56,952
Yeah, come in.

286
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:06,712
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

287
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:13,761
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

288
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:18,933
And I know that's upset you in the past.

289
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:24,230
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

290
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:30,402
But it's because I admire you
and love you,

291
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:33,405
that I kept things secret from you.

292
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,868
Now you're the only one I can trust.

293
00:38:40,746 --> 00:38:42,498
Fredo?

294
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:45,292
Well, he's got a good heart.

295
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:50,089
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

296
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:54,135
Tom, you're my brother.

297
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:04,812
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

298
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,525
I know that.

299
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:18,576
You're going to take over.

300
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:21,036
You're going to be the Don.

301
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:29,378
If what I think has happened, has
happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

302
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:36,343
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

303
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:44,852
I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife
and my children, the future of this family.

304
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:53,152
- If we catch them, will we find out?
- We won't catch them.

305
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:58,657
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

306
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:03,412
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

307
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:08,125
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

308
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:12,797
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

309
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:20,721
See... All our people are businessmen.

310
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:25,392
Their loyalty is based on that.

311
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,189
One thing I learned from Pop...

312
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:35,861
...was to try to think
as people around you think.

313
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:40,491
On that basis, anything is possible.

314
00:40:41,992 --> 00:40:45,746
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

315
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:49,041
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

316
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:02,888
Over here! There's two of them.

317
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:07,726
Looks like they were hired out of
New York. I don't recognise them.

318
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:10,855
Won't get anything out of them now.

319
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:13,149
Fish them out.

320
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:39,842
Get rid of the bodies.

321
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,970
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

322
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:18,255
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

323
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:38,943
- Did you like your party?
- I got lots of presents.

324
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:42,446
I know. Did you like them?

325
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:45,908
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

326
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,245
Well, they were friends.

327
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,501
- Did you see my present for you?
- It was on my pillow.

328
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:01,173
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

329
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:06,345
- Will you take me?
- No, I can't, Anthony.

330
00:43:06,554 --> 00:43:11,350
- Why do you have to go?
- I have to do business.

331
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:15,146
I could help you.

332
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:20,568
I know. Some day you will.

333
00:43:21,986 --> 00:43:24,029
Get some sleep.

334
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,360
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

335
00:45:04,255 --> 00:45:08,843
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

336
00:45:18,102 --> 00:45:22,565
I left Naples. I left Mama.

337
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:25,693
For a no-good tramp!

338
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:31,907
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

339
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:37,496
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

340
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:41,459
Without news from home.

341
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:52,678
Finally, a letter from Naples!

342
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:59,018
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

343
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:01,604
She's very beautiful.

344
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:07,067
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

345
00:46:07,276 --> 00:46:09,403
Our dear mother -

346
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:13,532
...is dead!

347
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:13,134
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

348
00:47:17,263 --> 00:47:19,557
Sit down, you bum!

349
00:47:25,729 --> 00:47:28,441
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

350
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:38,951
We'll go see her backstage.

351
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:43,456
Who was that?

352
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:45,666
The Black Hand.

353
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:20,618
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

354
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:23,454
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

355
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:27,249
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

356
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,877
You'll pay me today!

357
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:41,972
Let's go.

358
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:47,311
Not my daughter! Let her go!

359
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:51,107
Here, take all my money!

360
00:48:58,948 --> 00:49:01,200
Vito, come on.

361
00:49:07,623 --> 00:49:11,460
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

362
00:49:11,669 --> 00:49:15,464
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

363
00:49:15,673 --> 00:49:17,591
Even my father, in the grocery store.

364
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,844
If he's Italian...

365
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:23,597
...why does he bother other Italians?

366
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:26,559
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

367
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:28,394
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

368
00:49:28,602 --> 00:49:31,147
If you're happy, I'm happy.

369
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:20,988
Don't you feel well?

370
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,037
Is your boss treating you all right?

371
00:50:28,245 --> 00:50:30,498
Forget it.

372
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,721
Hey, you speak Italian?

373
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:53,270
Hide this for me!

374
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:56,857
Next week I'll come and get it!

375
00:51:35,438 --> 00:51:40,192
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

376
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:45,239
How's business?

377
00:51:50,828 --> 00:51:53,289
It's good, it's good.

378
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:03,090
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

379
00:52:03,299 --> 00:52:07,136
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

380
00:52:07,344 --> 00:52:10,431
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

381
00:52:15,686 --> 00:52:17,980
So Fanucci's changing?

382
00:52:18,189 --> 00:52:20,941
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

383
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:24,278
Even from my father.

384
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:29,074
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

385
00:53:00,064 --> 00:53:02,817
I've got some bad news.

386
00:53:06,779 --> 00:53:11,367
I feel rotten about telling you this...

387
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:16,789
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

388
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:25,631
And you have to give him my job.

389
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,636
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

390
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:33,222
You looked after me like a father.

391
00:53:33,431 --> 00:53:35,099
I thank you.

392
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,061
And I won't forget it.

393
00:53:51,782 --> 00:53:53,701
Vito!

394
00:53:58,038 --> 00:53:59,623
Oh, no!

395
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:04,545
Take this to your family.

396
00:54:05,463 --> 00:54:08,841
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

397
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:45,628
What a nice pear!

398
00:55:08,275 --> 00:55:11,946
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

399
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:16,742
Did you look inside?

400
00:55:17,785 --> 00:55:21,914
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

401
00:55:31,924 --> 00:55:36,720
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

402
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:47,231
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

403
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:53,279
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

404
00:56:00,578 --> 00:56:02,455
Yeah, sure.

405
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:05,458
My wife would like it.

406
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:32,151
The son of a bitch! He isn't home!

407
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:38,365
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

408
00:56:42,286 --> 00:56:44,789
Well, he won't mind.

409
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:25,913
This is your friend's place?

410
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:30,042
This is a real palace.

411
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:32,086
One of the best.

412
00:57:38,509 --> 00:57:40,970
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

413
00:59:37,169 --> 00:59:40,423
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

414
01:02:08,779 --> 01:02:11,323
Come on in.

415
01:02:12,491 --> 01:02:15,327
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

416
01:02:15,536 --> 01:02:20,332
- Would you like a tuna sandwich?
- No, thank you.

417
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:30,301
<i>... pick up of two by Holden.</i>
<i>Second and eight for S. C...</i>

418
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:34,972
- Mr Roth?
- Come in, Michael.

419
01:02:36,932 --> 01:02:40,102
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

420
01:02:41,562 --> 01:02:44,148
It's almost over.

421
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:50,196
- Do you follow the football game?
- Not for a while I haven't.

422
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,783
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

423
01:02:53,991 --> 01:02:58,913
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

424
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:05,252
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

425
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,511
I heard you had some trouble.

426
01:03:16,138 --> 01:03:17,890
Stupid.

427
01:03:19,016 --> 01:03:21,977
People behaving like that with guns.

428
01:03:23,854 --> 01:03:26,774
The important thing is you're all right.

429
01:03:26,982 --> 01:03:30,069
Good health is the most important thing.

430
01:03:30,903 --> 01:03:33,781
More than success, more than money.

431
01:03:35,366 --> 01:03:36,992
More than power.

432
01:03:51,507 --> 01:03:55,302
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

433
01:03:55,511 --> 01:03:59,473
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

434
01:04:00,558 --> 01:04:03,602
Nobody wants another war.

435
01:04:03,811 --> 01:04:08,983
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

436
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:13,404
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

437
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:15,531
I'll visit him soon.

438
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:20,494
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

439
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,039
Nothing is more important.

440
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:31,005
- You're a wise and considerate man.
- And you're a great man, Mr Roth.

441
01:04:32,006 --> 01:04:36,969
- There's much I can learn from you.
- Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

442
01:04:38,888 --> 01:04:41,557
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Come in.

443
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:46,645
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're going to break your eardrums.

444
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:50,149
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

445
01:04:55,946 --> 01:04:58,699
You're young, I'm old and sick.

446
01:04:59,825 --> 01:05:03,788
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

447
01:05:04,955 --> 01:05:07,208
It's never been done before.

448
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:12,379
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

449
01:05:14,423 --> 01:05:19,345
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

450
01:05:20,513 --> 01:05:23,474
He's small potatoes.

451
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,820
What's up?

452
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:40,366
We got company?

453
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:58,467
Michael Corleone is here.

454
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:04,014
He's in your den. You better hurry.

455
01:06:04,223 --> 01:06:07,309
He's been waiting a half hour.

456
01:06:13,607 --> 01:06:15,943
Is something wrong?

457
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:23,159
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

458
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:27,246
- I could have prepared something.
- I didn't want you to know.

459
01:06:34,754 --> 01:06:39,049
- You heard what happened?
- I almost died. We were so relieved...

460
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:41,302
In my home!

461
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:47,725
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

462
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,021
Where my children come to play.

463
01:06:53,689 --> 01:06:55,733
In my home.

464
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:15,795
I want you to help me take my revenge.

465
01:07:16,003 --> 01:07:19,632
Michael, anything. What can I do?

466
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,930
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

467
01:07:26,138 --> 01:07:28,599
I don't understand. I don't...

468
01:07:28,808 --> 01:07:33,521
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

469
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:38,692
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

470
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:43,489
- I know he is.
- So why ask me to lay down to them?

471
01:07:49,453 --> 01:07:53,249
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

472
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:57,169
I know it was him.

473
01:07:57,795 --> 01:08:00,256
Jesus Christ, Mike.

474
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:04,760
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

475
01:08:10,307 --> 01:08:13,144
This used to be my father's old study.

476
01:08:14,353 --> 01:08:16,605
It's changed.

477
01:08:17,648 --> 01:08:21,777
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

478
01:08:24,989 --> 01:08:30,161
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

479
01:08:37,626 --> 01:08:41,756
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

480
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:46,427
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

481
01:08:48,554 --> 01:08:52,933
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

482
01:08:55,019 --> 01:08:59,023
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

483
01:09:03,235 --> 01:09:09,492
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favour,

484
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,120
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

485
01:09:15,873 --> 01:09:18,417
That's what I want him to think.

486
01:09:19,085 --> 01:09:22,963
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

487
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:27,885
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

488
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:58,833
- Yeah?
- <i>Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.</i>

489
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:03,421
- <i>We need some more help.</i>
- Johnny?

490
01:10:04,296 --> 01:10:07,299
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

491
01:10:07,508 --> 01:10:10,302
- Who's that, honey?
- <i>Listen good, Fredo.</i>

492
01:10:10,511 --> 01:10:13,639
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

493
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:17,184
<i>Pentangeli is going to accept</i>
<i>the Rosato brothers' deal.</i>

494
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:19,437
- Oh, God.
- <i>Will he come alone?</i>

495
01:10:19,645 --> 01:10:22,731
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

496
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:28,112
<i>Everything will be all right. Pentangeli</i>
<i>says he's willing to make a deal.</i>

497
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,700
<i>All we want to know is if he's on</i>
<i>the level, or if he'll bring his boys.</i>

498
01:10:32,908 --> 01:10:35,995
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me anymore.

499
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:41,375
- <i>Your brother won't find out we talked.</i>
- I don't know what you're talking about.

500
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,097
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

501
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:06,776
- Frankie, I've got nobody here.
- Wait in the car, Cicc'.

502
01:11:06,984 --> 01:11:09,653
- Frankie.
- That's okay, Cicc'.

503
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:20,414
- What's this?
- A lucky C note for our new deal.

504
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,920
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

505
01:11:30,174 --> 01:11:33,636
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

506
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:38,474
- You won't regret it.
- I don't like the C note, Rosato.

507
01:11:38,682 --> 01:11:41,393
I take that as an insult.

508
01:11:41,602 --> 01:11:44,605
Michael Corleone says hello!

509
01:12:01,747 --> 01:12:03,374
Close the door!

510
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:05,793
Your friend the cop...

511
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:10,506
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

512
01:12:10,714 --> 01:12:14,510
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

513
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:19,473
What's the matter?

514
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:23,811
- Is that something on the floor?
- Carmine, not here! Anthony!

515
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:30,651
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

516
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:18,949
Freddy, it's good to see you.

517
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:26,165
- How is he?
- He's okay. He's in the back.

518
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:32,630
Girls, take a hike.

519
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,010
In this room here.

520
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:44,225
- I want to talk to him alone first.
- Come on.

521
01:13:52,817 --> 01:13:56,195
I thought I could help you, Senator.

522
01:13:59,615 --> 01:14:01,408
Hagen?

523
01:14:02,701 --> 01:14:06,872
- Listen, I did not...
- It's all right.

524
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:11,794
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. You're very lucky.

525
01:14:12,628 --> 01:14:17,258
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

526
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:22,221
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

527
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:28,477
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

528
01:14:29,603 --> 01:14:34,024
- And I don't know how it happened.
- You can't remember?

529
01:14:37,278 --> 01:14:39,405
I passed out.

530
01:14:55,546 --> 01:14:58,632
Just a game. Jesus.

531
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:11,437
Jesus, Jesus!

532
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,360
Jesus God!

533
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:20,571
God!

534
01:15:22,782 --> 01:15:26,619
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

535
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:29,622
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

536
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:35,669
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

537
01:15:36,337 --> 01:15:41,342
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

538
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:46,055
- As his guest.
- I do remember that she was laughing.

539
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:53,521
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

540
01:15:54,522 --> 01:15:58,651
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

541
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:02,446
It'll be as though she never existed.

542
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:06,826
All that's left is our friendship.

543
01:16:21,799 --> 01:16:25,678
- Yes?
- Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

544
01:16:26,303 --> 01:16:30,433
- I'm just going to the market.
- We'll pick up anything you want.

545
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:33,894
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr Hagen's. He's coming.

546
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:36,188
I'll speak to him.

547
01:16:42,361 --> 01:16:45,906
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

548
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:50,244
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

549
01:16:50,453 --> 01:16:55,499
- So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
- No, within the compound will be fine.

550
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:58,878
- We were going to New England.
- That's off.

551
01:16:59,336 --> 01:17:02,715
- Am I a prisoner?
- That's not how we see it, Kay.

552
01:17:02,923 --> 01:17:06,135
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

553
01:17:08,262 --> 01:17:10,139
Joe.

554
01:17:55,935 --> 01:17:57,686
Cuba, Cuba!

555
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:41,480
Most respected gentlemen.

556
01:18:41,856 --> 01:18:44,024
Welcome to Havana.

557
01:18:46,152 --> 01:18:51,323
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists...

558
01:18:53,117 --> 01:18:56,036
...for continuing to work with Cuba...

559
01:18:56,746 --> 01:18:59,832
...for the greatest period of prosperity...

560
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,586
...in her entire history.

561
01:19:04,003 --> 01:19:06,255
Mr William Shaw...

562
01:19:06,464 --> 01:19:09,967
...representing
the General Fruit Company.

563
01:19:10,176 --> 01:19:12,678
Messrs Corngold and Dant...

564
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:16,849
...of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

565
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:18,517
Mr Petty...

566
01:19:18,726 --> 01:19:24,273
...regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

567
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:28,861
Mr Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

568
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:33,073
Mr Michael Corleone of Nevada...

569
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:37,787
...representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

570
01:19:37,995 --> 01:19:42,750
And my old friend and associate
from Florida...

571
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:45,127
...Mr Hyman Roth.

572
01:19:45,336 --> 01:19:50,508
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

573
01:19:55,346 --> 01:19:58,432
A solid gold telephone.

574
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:03,604
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

575
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,315
- Mr President?
- Yes?

576
01:20:06,524 --> 01:20:12,279
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

577
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:13,823
- Of course.
- Heavy stuff.

578
01:20:14,031 --> 01:20:19,662
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas...

579
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:31,715
...my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

580
01:20:31,924 --> 01:20:34,260
before the New Year.

581
01:20:36,303 --> 01:20:38,556
I want to put you all at ease.

582
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:43,936
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

583
01:21:01,579 --> 01:21:06,709
He said that they're making an arrest,
and in a few minutes he'll let us through.

584
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:07,918
Johnny...

585
01:21:08,127 --> 01:21:09,128
It's nothing.

586
01:21:09,336 --> 01:21:13,466
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

587
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:16,385
<i>Viva Fidel!</i>

588
01:21:32,193 --> 01:21:37,114
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

589
01:21:38,282 --> 01:21:42,203
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

590
01:21:44,997 --> 01:21:47,666
I'm very pleased...

591
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:52,963
...you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

592
01:21:53,964 --> 01:21:57,468
When a man comes to this point
in his life...

593
01:21:58,177 --> 01:22:01,263
...he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

594
01:22:01,764 --> 01:22:06,310
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had...

595
01:22:08,145 --> 01:22:13,317
...and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

596
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:16,237
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear!

597
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:21,617
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

598
01:22:21,867 --> 01:22:26,497
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana,

599
01:22:26,705 --> 01:22:29,750
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

600
01:22:29,959 --> 01:22:34,672
This kind of government knows how to
help business, to encourage it.

601
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,679
The hotels here are bigger and swankier
than any of the joints in Vegas.

602
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:44,473
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government,

603
01:22:44,682 --> 01:22:49,937
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis,

604
01:22:50,146 --> 01:22:52,481
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

605
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:57,278
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed:

606
01:22:57,486 --> 01:23:00,281
Real partnership with a government.

607
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:02,116
Smaller piece.

608
01:23:02,908 --> 01:23:07,913
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

609
01:23:08,122 --> 01:23:11,709
At the time of my retirement, or death,

610
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:17,631
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

611
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,385
But, all of you will share.

612
01:23:21,594 --> 01:23:25,598
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

613
01:23:25,806 --> 01:23:28,893
the Capri to the Corleone family,

614
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:31,562
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

615
01:23:31,771 --> 01:23:37,526
but Eddie Levine will bring in the Pennino
brothers, Dino and Eddie, for a piece

616
01:23:37,735 --> 01:23:40,362
and to handle the casino operations.

617
01:23:40,571 --> 01:23:43,824
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

618
01:23:44,033 --> 01:23:47,745
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

619
01:23:49,872 --> 01:23:54,835
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

620
01:23:55,044 --> 01:23:57,463
- Happy birthday!
- <i>L'chaim!</i>

621
01:23:58,589 --> 01:24:01,675
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

622
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:05,846
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

623
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:10,476
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

624
01:24:10,684 --> 01:24:14,480
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

625
01:24:14,688 --> 01:24:18,442
- Those rebels are lunatics.
- Maybe so.

626
01:24:19,652 --> 01:24:24,532
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

627
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:28,452
- What does that tell you?
- They can win.

628
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:34,417
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

629
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:38,295
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

630
01:24:38,504 --> 01:24:42,216
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

631
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:45,845
The trucks were owned by your father.

632
01:24:46,053 --> 01:24:47,638
Michael...

633
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:58,941
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

634
01:25:00,526 --> 01:25:03,612
The two million never got to the island.

635
01:25:09,285 --> 01:25:12,371
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money,

636
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,040
because you worried about the rebels.

637
01:25:21,839 --> 01:25:25,092
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

638
01:25:32,767 --> 01:25:36,604
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

639
01:25:39,106 --> 01:25:43,277
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

640
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:49,742
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

641
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:53,662
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

642
01:25:53,871 --> 01:25:57,374
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

643
01:25:58,626 --> 01:26:02,088
90 miles. It's nothing.

644
01:26:03,047 --> 01:26:08,886
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

645
01:26:09,095 --> 01:26:12,348
and having the cash
to make it possible.

646
01:26:12,556 --> 01:26:14,058
Michael...

647
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,603
...we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

648
01:26:44,964 --> 01:26:47,925
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

649
01:26:49,385 --> 01:26:54,014
- Hi! Freddie Corleone.
- <i>Mio frati.</i>

650
01:26:55,182 --> 01:26:57,643
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

651
01:26:57,852 --> 01:27:01,355
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

652
01:27:01,564 --> 01:27:06,026
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

653
01:27:09,739 --> 01:27:12,616
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

654
01:27:14,034 --> 01:27:16,704
You want to count it?

655
01:27:20,374 --> 01:27:23,878
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

656
01:27:24,086 --> 01:27:29,592
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

657
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,304
That's great! Havana's great.

658
01:27:34,805 --> 01:27:37,308
It's my kind of town.

659
01:27:38,184 --> 01:27:43,355
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

660
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,527
No. I've never met them.

661
01:27:52,156 --> 01:27:56,160
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

662
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:04,418
...kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

663
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:08,297
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

664
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:12,718
I know a place where we
can spend some time together.

665
01:28:14,011 --> 01:28:19,600
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

666
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:23,312
Have kids. Have a family.

667
01:28:24,814 --> 01:28:28,692
For once in my life, be more like...

668
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:31,403
...Pop.

669
01:28:33,614 --> 01:28:38,160
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

670
01:28:38,369 --> 01:28:41,539
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me."

671
01:28:41,747 --> 01:28:45,167
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

672
01:28:45,376 --> 01:28:48,129
Sometimes I think it's true.

673
01:28:48,337 --> 01:28:50,881
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

674
01:28:51,757 --> 01:28:55,553
Mikey... I was mad at you.

675
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:06,814
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

676
01:29:07,022 --> 01:29:09,567
- You want a drink, right?
- Waiter!

677
01:29:13,779 --> 01:29:15,865
<i>Por favor...</i>

678
01:29:17,241 --> 01:29:20,119
- How do you say Banana Daquiri?
- Banana Daquiri.

679
01:29:20,327 --> 01:29:22,663
- That's it?
- That's it.

680
01:29:22,872 --> 01:29:25,624
<i>Uno</i> Banana Daquiri...

681
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:28,169
...and a club soda.

682
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:41,223
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow with some government people.

683
01:29:41,432 --> 01:29:45,060
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

684
01:29:46,854 --> 01:29:50,900
- That's my speciality, right?
- Can I trust you with something?

685
01:29:51,692 --> 01:29:54,069
Of course, Mike.

686
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:01,869
Later in the evening we're all invited to
the President to bring in the New Year.

687
01:30:02,411 --> 01:30:08,000
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car - alone.

688
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:10,753
For my protection.

689
01:30:10,961 --> 01:30:15,216
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

690
01:30:32,608 --> 01:30:35,736
- Who?
- Roth.

691
01:30:41,367 --> 01:30:44,787
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

692
01:30:46,122 --> 01:30:48,332
It was Roth all along.

693
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:52,503
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

694
01:30:53,587 --> 01:30:56,715
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

695
01:31:01,637 --> 01:31:06,142
- How can I help?
- Just go along, as if you know nothing.

696
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:10,271
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

697
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:13,023
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

698
01:31:30,249 --> 01:31:34,044
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

699
01:31:34,253 --> 01:31:39,133
Fly in my own doctor from Miami. I don't
trust a doctor who can't speak English.

700
01:31:40,676 --> 01:31:43,804
- <i>Gracias, señor.</i>
- <i>Buenas noches.</i>

701
01:31:45,389 --> 01:31:49,059
- Honey, go to the casino.
- If you're feeling better.

702
01:31:49,268 --> 01:31:51,395
Feel fine.

703
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:57,443
- Play the bingo game.
- Okay. Nice to see you, Mr Paul.

704
01:31:59,403 --> 01:32:04,366
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

705
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:13,459
- You're pulling out?
- Just want to... Just want to wait.

706
01:32:17,088 --> 01:32:20,549
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

707
01:32:20,758 --> 01:32:24,345
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

708
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:30,684
- Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
- The Rosato brothers.

709
01:32:30,893 --> 01:32:34,563
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

710
01:32:34,772 --> 01:32:36,315
I know I didn't.

711
01:32:44,573 --> 01:32:49,578
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

712
01:32:49,787 --> 01:32:55,876
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

713
01:32:56,377 --> 01:33:00,131
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

714
01:33:01,424 --> 01:33:05,970
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

715
01:33:06,178 --> 01:33:09,265
Made a fortune. Your father too.

716
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:16,856
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

717
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:25,448
Later on he had an idea to build a city

718
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:29,410
out of a desert stop-over
for G.I.s going to the West Coast.

719
01:33:31,328 --> 01:33:35,040
That kid's name was Moe Greene

720
01:33:35,249 --> 01:33:38,878
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

721
01:33:40,045 --> 01:33:42,548
This was a great man.

722
01:33:42,757 --> 01:33:45,217
A man of vision and guts.

723
01:33:45,426 --> 01:33:51,640
And there isn't even a plaque, signpost
or statue of him in that town.

724
01:33:53,559 --> 01:33:57,146
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

725
01:33:58,397 --> 01:34:00,691
No one knows who gave the order.

726
01:34:01,734 --> 01:34:04,904
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

727
01:34:05,112 --> 01:34:10,993
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

728
01:34:11,202 --> 01:34:15,956
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

729
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:20,795
And I said to myself,

730
01:34:21,003 --> 01:34:24,882
"This is the business we've chosen."

731
01:34:25,091 --> 01:34:27,301
I didn't ask...

732
01:34:27,885 --> 01:34:33,057
...who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

733
01:34:41,607 --> 01:34:46,070
That two million in a bag in your room...

734
01:34:48,364 --> 01:34:51,992
I'm going in to take a nap.

735
01:34:52,451 --> 01:34:58,374
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

736
01:34:58,582 --> 01:35:01,669
If it isn't, I know I don't.

737
01:35:56,682 --> 01:36:00,853
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

738
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:04,273
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

739
01:36:04,482 --> 01:36:07,359
Senator Payton from Florida...

740
01:36:07,568 --> 01:36:10,696
...Judge DeMalco from New York...

741
01:36:10,905 --> 01:36:13,699
...Senator Ream from Maryland...

742
01:36:13,908 --> 01:36:16,368
...Fred Corngold from UTT.

743
01:36:16,577 --> 01:36:20,372
- That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
- He does?

744
01:36:20,581 --> 01:36:22,875
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

745
01:36:23,084 --> 01:36:27,546
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

746
01:36:27,755 --> 01:36:31,634
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas...

747
01:36:31,842 --> 01:36:34,637
- That you got! <i>Con gusto...</i>
- Johnny!

748
01:36:35,429 --> 01:36:39,016
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

749
01:36:39,225 --> 01:36:42,770
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

750
01:36:44,063 --> 01:36:46,482
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

751
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:48,234
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

752
01:36:48,442 --> 01:36:51,362
- <i>Feliz Año Nuevo!</i>
- Happy New Year.

753
01:37:03,082 --> 01:37:07,169
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standing?
- Everybody stands.

754
01:37:07,378 --> 01:37:11,882
- It's worth it. You won't believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

755
01:37:12,091 --> 01:37:15,177
- 50 dollars, right?
- You've got a bet, mister.

756
01:37:23,352 --> 01:37:24,812
That's Superman.

757
01:37:58,888 --> 01:38:01,098
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

758
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:05,394
- I don't believe it!
- It's got to be fake.

759
01:38:05,603 --> 01:38:08,898
It's real. That's why he's called
Superman.

760
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:13,360
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

761
01:38:13,569 --> 01:38:17,865
Johnny Ola brought me here.
I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!

762
01:38:18,074 --> 01:38:21,577
- I see it, but still don't believe it!
- 50 bucks, Pat.

763
01:38:21,786 --> 01:38:25,372
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

764
01:38:26,123 --> 01:38:31,045
- Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
- I want to see him break a brick!

765
01:39:53,043 --> 01:39:56,422
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

766
01:40:45,554 --> 01:40:47,973
...and you'll continue to get those.

767
01:40:48,182 --> 01:40:52,436
I don't believe that President Eisenhower
would ever pull out of Cuba,

768
01:40:52,645 --> 01:40:56,315
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

769
01:40:59,652 --> 01:41:03,239
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

770
01:41:03,447 --> 01:41:06,033
Fredo! Where are you going?

771
01:41:06,242 --> 01:41:09,870
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

772
01:42:05,468 --> 01:42:08,888
What kept Mr Roth?
I understood he was coming.

773
01:42:09,096 --> 01:42:12,600
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

774
01:42:12,808 --> 01:42:18,147
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

775
01:42:34,413 --> 01:42:39,877
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

776
01:43:52,533 --> 01:43:56,662
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

777
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:59,457
Don't make a big thing about it.

778
01:44:03,085 --> 01:44:06,839
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

779
01:44:08,382 --> 01:44:10,134
You broke my heart!

780
01:44:50,341 --> 01:44:55,513
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

781
01:44:55,721 --> 01:45:00,017
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

782
01:45:00,226 --> 01:45:05,356
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

783
01:45:05,564 --> 01:45:08,943
And I shall leave the city immediately.

784
01:45:12,947 --> 01:45:16,117
I wish all of you good luck.

785
01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:26,293
<i>Salud!</i>

786
01:45:27,545 --> 01:45:30,923
<i>Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!</i>

787
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:54,321
Fredo!

788
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:58,951
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

789
01:45:59,577 --> 01:46:01,495
Roth is dead.

790
01:46:02,329 --> 01:46:06,500
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

791
01:46:07,668 --> 01:46:09,128
Fredo!

792
01:46:33,778 --> 01:46:36,572
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

793
01:47:06,268 --> 01:47:09,563
<i>Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!</i>

794
01:47:49,728 --> 01:47:53,232
Al. Get me a wet towel.

795
01:47:59,947 --> 01:48:02,783
Does Kay know I'm back?

796
01:48:06,579 --> 01:48:09,915
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

797
01:48:10,124 --> 01:48:13,502
- I took care of it.
- What was it, so I'll know.

798
01:48:13,711 --> 01:48:18,716
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

799
01:48:21,302 --> 01:48:23,345
Thank you, Al.

800
01:48:24,221 --> 01:48:27,683
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

801
01:48:44,867 --> 01:48:47,411
Where's my brother?

802
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:50,831
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

803
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:55,628
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

804
01:48:55,836 --> 01:48:58,506
I asked about Fredo.

805
01:48:58,714 --> 01:49:02,843
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

806
01:49:04,887 --> 01:49:06,555
All right.

807
01:49:07,556 --> 01:49:10,434
I want you to get in touch with him.

808
01:49:10,643 --> 01:49:13,687
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

809
01:49:13,896 --> 01:49:19,193
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

810
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:24,115
- They can come in now.
- There was something else.

811
01:49:25,157 --> 01:49:26,826
What?

812
01:49:33,124 --> 01:49:34,875
What? Come on.

813
01:49:37,253 --> 01:49:39,505
Kay had a miscarriage.

814
01:49:52,393 --> 01:49:55,521
- Was it a boy?
- At three and a half months...

815
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:59,358
Can't you give me a straight answer?!
Was it a boy?

816
01:50:02,153 --> 01:50:04,655
I really don't know.

817
01:50:19,712 --> 01:50:22,715
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

818
01:51:08,427 --> 01:51:12,223
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

819
01:51:12,431 --> 01:51:16,435
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

820
01:51:16,644 --> 01:51:19,271
You know I've got three daughters.

821
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,399
This is my neighborhood.

822
01:51:21,607 --> 01:51:25,319
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

823
01:51:26,028 --> 01:51:30,032
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

824
01:51:32,243 --> 01:51:36,372
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

825
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:41,419
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

826
01:51:41,627 --> 01:51:47,091
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

827
01:51:49,009 --> 01:51:51,679
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

828
01:51:51,887 --> 01:51:55,307
And your family will be ruined.

829
01:51:55,516 --> 01:52:01,021
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

830
01:52:01,230 --> 01:52:05,735
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

831
01:52:05,943 --> 01:52:08,404
Now don't refuse me.

832
01:52:09,613 --> 01:52:11,657
Understand, <i>paesano?</i>

833
01:52:17,455 --> 01:52:19,707
I understand.

834
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:26,881
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

835
01:52:27,715 --> 01:52:33,220
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

836
01:52:36,432 --> 01:52:38,934
Don't be afraid to tell them!

837
01:52:41,145 --> 01:52:44,106
600 bucks...

838
01:52:44,315 --> 01:52:46,484
Suppose we don't pay?

839
01:52:46,692 --> 01:52:50,279
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

840
01:52:50,488 --> 01:52:56,285
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

841
01:52:56,494 --> 01:52:58,829
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We <i>have</i> to pay him.

842
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:01,540
$200 each... everybody agreed?

843
01:53:06,087 --> 01:53:07,588
Why do we have to pay him?

844
01:53:07,797 --> 01:53:11,133
Vito, leave this to us.

845
01:53:11,467 --> 01:53:14,428
He's one person, we're three.

846
01:53:14,637 --> 01:53:17,515
He's got guns, we've got guns.

847
01:53:17,723 --> 01:53:20,851
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

848
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,813
This is <i>his</i> neighborhood!

849
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:30,027
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

850
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:39,453
They don't pay Fanucci.

851
01:53:39,662 --> 01:53:44,917
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody <i>else</i> collects for Maranzalla!

852
01:53:45,126 --> 01:53:50,256
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

853
01:54:05,104 --> 01:54:07,982
Now what I say stays in this room.

854
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:13,404
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

855
01:54:16,031 --> 01:54:19,952
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

856
01:54:22,288 --> 01:54:24,415
If Fanucci says $200...

857
01:54:24,623 --> 01:54:26,208
...he <i>means</i> it, Vito!

858
01:54:26,417 --> 01:54:29,754
I'll reason with him.

859
01:54:31,714 --> 01:54:34,133
Leave everything to me.

860
01:54:34,341 --> 01:54:37,845
I'll take care of everything.

861
01:54:38,053 --> 01:54:41,265
I never lie to my friends.

862
01:54:41,474 --> 01:54:44,477
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

863
01:54:44,685 --> 01:54:47,480
He'll ask for the money.

864
01:54:47,688 --> 01:54:53,652
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

865
01:54:53,861 --> 01:54:56,781
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

866
01:54:57,031 --> 01:55:01,744
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

867
01:55:01,952 --> 01:55:05,164
How can you get him to take less?

868
01:55:05,372 --> 01:55:08,000
That's my business.

869
01:55:08,209 --> 01:55:11,670
Just remember that I did you a favor.

870
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:18,511
Is it a deal?

871
01:56:07,476 --> 01:56:09,979
His family's out of the house.

872
01:56:10,187 --> 01:56:12,857
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

873
01:56:17,361 --> 01:56:21,031
Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
<i>Buona fortuna.</i>

874
01:56:32,209 --> 01:56:35,129
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

875
01:56:38,299 --> 01:56:42,553
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

876
01:57:15,377 --> 01:57:20,883
It looks like there's -
$100 under my hat.

877
01:57:31,977 --> 01:57:34,688
I was right.

878
01:57:35,606 --> 01:57:37,983
Only $100...

879
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:44,407
I'm short of money right now.

880
01:57:44,615 --> 01:57:49,912
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

881
01:57:50,121 --> 01:57:52,581
You understand, don't you?

882
01:58:00,798 --> 01:58:03,884
You've got balls, young man!

883
01:58:05,428 --> 01:58:09,432
How come I never heard
of you before?

884
01:58:14,937 --> 01:58:18,023
You've got a lot of guts.

885
01:58:21,485 --> 01:58:24,572
I'll find you some work
for good money.

886
01:58:35,666 --> 01:58:40,588
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

887
01:58:42,798 --> 01:58:45,676
You've done well for yourself.

888
01:58:48,888 --> 01:58:51,307
Enjoy the festa!

889
02:00:59,935 --> 02:01:03,064
Oh, this is too violent for me!

890
02:03:24,538 --> 02:03:26,582
What've you got there?

891
02:06:04,782 --> 02:06:09,370
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

892
02:09:34,309 --> 02:09:38,021
<i>Mr Cicci, from the year 1942</i>
<i>to the present time,</i>

893
02:09:38,230 --> 02:09:41,692
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

894
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:43,485
That's right.

895
02:09:44,278 --> 02:09:48,449
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organisation.

896
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:55,581
No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.

897
02:09:55,789 --> 02:09:58,250
What was your position?

898
02:09:58,834 --> 02:10:01,920
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

899
02:10:02,129 --> 02:10:05,382
- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator.

900
02:10:05,591 --> 02:10:07,843
No, I don't know. Tell me.

901
02:10:09,344 --> 02:10:14,767
When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?

902
02:10:14,975 --> 02:10:16,310
Mr Questadt.

903
02:10:17,102 --> 02:10:19,313
You mean you kill people?

904
02:10:19,521 --> 02:10:24,359
You kill people at the...
behest of your superiors.

905
02:10:28,072 --> 02:10:29,531
Yeah, that's right.

906
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:35,245
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

907
02:10:35,454 --> 02:10:38,332
Yeah, Counsellor. Michael Corleone.

908
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:42,961
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

909
02:10:43,170 --> 02:10:45,214
No, I never talked to him.

910
02:10:45,422 --> 02:10:49,176
Mr Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?

911
02:10:49,384 --> 02:10:52,679
- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?

912
02:10:52,888 --> 02:10:57,810
I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?

913
02:10:58,477 --> 02:11:03,107
Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.

914
02:11:03,315 --> 02:11:07,736
Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!

915
02:11:08,737 --> 02:11:13,909
You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.

916
02:11:41,937 --> 02:11:44,356
Tell me something, Ma.

917
02:11:48,277 --> 02:11:52,406
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

918
02:11:58,328 --> 02:12:01,165
He was being strong...

919
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:08,881
Strong for his family.

920
02:12:18,265 --> 02:12:21,310
But by being strong for his family...

921
02:12:22,436 --> 02:12:24,688
...could he...

922
02:12:26,398 --> 02:12:27,775
...lose it?

923
02:12:29,401 --> 02:12:35,324
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

924
02:12:36,533 --> 02:12:40,662
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

925
02:12:41,538 --> 02:12:46,085
No, I meant... lose his <i>family.</i>

926
02:12:47,878 --> 02:12:51,590
But you can never lose your family.

927
02:13:00,849 --> 02:13:03,102
Times are changing.

928
02:13:24,957 --> 02:13:28,419
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

929
02:13:28,627 --> 02:13:30,963
Take it as a gift.

930
02:13:33,549 --> 02:13:37,678
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

931
02:13:53,569 --> 02:13:57,698
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

932
02:13:59,575 --> 02:14:05,414
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

933
02:14:05,622 --> 02:14:08,125
She's in bad trouble.

934
02:14:08,333 --> 02:14:13,255
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

935
02:14:14,006 --> 02:14:16,633
He told her to get rid of the animal.

936
02:14:17,968 --> 02:14:22,598
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

937
02:14:22,806 --> 02:14:26,935
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

938
02:14:27,478 --> 02:14:32,149
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

939
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:35,110
I'm so ashamed!

940
02:14:35,319 --> 02:14:40,491
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

941
02:14:42,201 --> 02:14:44,328
I'm sorry, but...

942
02:14:45,954 --> 02:14:50,084
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

943
02:14:50,292 --> 02:14:51,877
I can't move!

944
02:14:53,003 --> 02:14:55,339
I want you to talk to him!

945
02:14:55,547 --> 02:14:58,842
Tell him I want to stay here!

946
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:07,768
What's your landlord's name?

947
02:15:07,976 --> 02:15:10,354
His name is Signor Roberto.

948
02:15:10,604 --> 02:15:12,856
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

949
02:15:13,690 --> 02:15:17,361
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

950
02:15:17,569 --> 02:15:20,114
A real pig-sty, eh?

951
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:43,262
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

952
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:46,807
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

953
02:15:47,015 --> 02:15:51,478
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

954
02:15:51,687 --> 02:15:55,899
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

955
02:15:56,108 --> 02:16:00,279
I already rented the place
to another family.

956
02:16:05,075 --> 02:16:10,289
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

957
02:16:11,081 --> 02:16:15,335
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

958
02:16:15,544 --> 02:16:17,379
So let her stay.

959
02:16:17,588 --> 02:16:19,965
Impossible.

960
02:16:20,174 --> 02:16:21,300
Are you Sicilian?

961
02:16:21,508 --> 02:16:23,886
No, I'm Calabrese.

962
02:16:24,094 --> 02:16:27,306
We're practically <i>paesani,</i>
do me this favor.

963
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:29,933
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

964
02:16:30,142 --> 02:16:34,188
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

965
02:16:34,396 --> 02:16:37,107
How much more a month?

966
02:16:38,525 --> 02:16:40,778
Five bucks.

967
02:16:44,073 --> 02:16:46,950
Here's six months increase in advance.

968
02:16:47,159 --> 02:16:51,246
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

969
02:16:51,455 --> 02:16:54,541
Come see me in another six months.

970
02:16:55,542 --> 02:16:59,129
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

971
02:16:59,338 --> 02:17:00,798
The dog stays.

972
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:08,680
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

973
02:17:08,889 --> 02:17:14,937
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

974
02:17:15,229 --> 02:17:17,272
Do me this favor.

975
02:17:17,898 --> 02:17:20,234
I won't forget it.

976
02:17:20,901 --> 02:17:25,114
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

977
02:17:25,322 --> 02:17:29,576
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

978
02:17:34,456 --> 02:17:37,000
What a character!

979
02:17:45,134 --> 02:17:49,847
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

980
02:17:57,312 --> 02:18:01,442
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

981
02:18:08,407 --> 02:18:11,493
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

982
02:18:12,411 --> 02:18:14,872
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

983
02:18:15,873 --> 02:18:19,626
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

984
02:18:19,835 --> 02:18:24,840
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

985
02:18:29,052 --> 02:18:32,389
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

986
02:18:34,099 --> 02:18:39,813
<i>Un, due,</i> three, four, five, six, <i>tutt'!</i>

987
02:18:40,355 --> 02:18:45,110
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

988
02:18:53,744 --> 02:18:55,913
Can I sit down?

989
02:18:58,248 --> 02:19:01,835
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

990
02:19:02,252 --> 02:19:05,881
The rent stays like before!

991
02:19:15,265 --> 02:19:17,309
I'll even lower it.

992
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:22,731
I'll lower it $5.

993
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:26,860
I'll lower it $10!

994
02:19:32,991 --> 02:19:35,494
Can I offer you some coffee?

995
02:19:37,830 --> 02:19:42,960
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

996
02:19:47,756 --> 02:19:50,592
You'll have to excuse me for now.

997
02:19:55,472 --> 02:19:58,434
I wish I could stay longer!

998
02:20:03,105 --> 02:20:06,275
Just call me and I'll be here!

999
02:20:16,910 --> 02:20:20,164
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1000
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:40,392
- Vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

1001
02:20:49,526 --> 02:20:50,903
Would you speak up, please?

1002
02:20:51,111 --> 02:20:52,446
New York City.

1003
02:20:52,654 --> 02:20:56,158
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

1004
02:20:56,366 --> 02:20:59,995
- Where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

1005
02:21:00,204 --> 02:21:06,085
Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?

1006
02:21:06,919 --> 02:21:13,050
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.

1007
02:21:13,926 --> 02:21:18,388
Mr Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness' statement.

1008
02:21:18,597 --> 02:21:23,685
For years many of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.

1009
02:21:23,894 --> 02:21:25,938
I've come to know them well.

1010
02:21:26,438 --> 02:21:31,110
They have honoured me
with their support and their friendship.

1011
02:21:31,318 --> 02:21:36,490
I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are Italian-Americans.

1012
02:21:37,241 --> 02:21:42,246
However, Mr Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings,

1013
02:21:42,454 --> 02:21:47,334
in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

1014
02:21:47,543 --> 02:21:50,629
Before I leave, I do want to say this,

1015
02:21:50,838 --> 02:21:54,967
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever

1016
02:21:55,175 --> 02:21:57,845
a slur upon the great Italian people.

1017
02:21:58,053 --> 02:22:01,181
I can state from my own knowledge
and experience

1018
02:22:01,390 --> 02:22:06,311
that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,

1019
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:10,816
patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.

1020
02:22:11,024 --> 02:22:15,904
It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples

1021
02:22:16,113 --> 02:22:18,365
to give a bad name to the whole barrel.

1022
02:22:18,574 --> 02:22:23,954
Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi,

1023
02:22:24,163 --> 02:22:26,206
to the present day,

1024
02:22:26,415 --> 02:22:30,669
Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.

1025
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:36,341
They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.

1026
02:22:42,431 --> 02:22:46,143
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

1027
02:22:46,351 --> 02:22:50,397
Mr Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.

1028
02:22:50,606 --> 02:22:56,820
We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.

1029
02:22:57,029 --> 02:23:01,200
He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.

1030
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:03,869
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

1031
02:23:04,078 --> 02:23:07,706
He testified that you are personally
responsible

1032
02:23:07,915 --> 02:23:11,293
for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1947,

1033
02:23:11,502 --> 02:23:15,089
and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.

1034
02:23:15,297 --> 02:23:17,758
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.

1035
02:23:17,966 --> 02:23:21,011
Is it true that in the year 1950

1036
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:26,517
you devised the murder of the heads
of the "Five Families" in New York,

1037
02:23:26,725 --> 02:23:30,145
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?

1038
02:23:30,354 --> 02:23:33,524
- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr Questadt.

1039
02:23:33,732 --> 02:23:38,404
Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

1040
02:23:39,530 --> 02:23:44,701
No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.

1041
02:23:47,329 --> 02:23:51,542
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

1042
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:58,799
Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?

1043
02:23:59,007 --> 02:24:00,592
No, I do not.

1044
02:24:00,801 --> 02:24:04,096
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement.

1045
02:24:04,304 --> 02:24:09,852
Mr Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.

1046
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:15,858
Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.

1047
02:24:16,066 --> 02:24:21,905
He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!

1048
02:24:23,907 --> 02:24:28,829
No, I'll allow Mr Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.

1049
02:24:30,706 --> 02:24:33,792
In the hopes of clearing
my family name,

1050
02:24:34,001 --> 02:24:37,838
to give my children their share
of the American way of life

1051
02:24:38,046 --> 02:24:41,133
without a blemish on their name
and background,

1052
02:24:41,341 --> 02:24:46,513
I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.

1053
02:24:47,681 --> 02:24:53,187
I consider it a great personal dishonour
to have to deny that I am a criminal.

1054
02:24:54,271 --> 02:24:57,608
I wish to have the following noted
for the record:

1055
02:24:57,816 --> 02:25:01,820
That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two

1056
02:25:02,029 --> 02:25:07,201
and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defence of my country.

1057
02:25:07,951 --> 02:25:12,206
That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.

1058
02:25:12,414 --> 02:25:16,376
That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy,

1059
02:25:16,585 --> 02:25:21,215
whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name,

1060
02:25:21,423 --> 02:25:23,717
has ever been made public.

1061
02:25:23,926 --> 02:25:29,098
I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth
Amendment, although I may do so.

1062
02:25:31,975 --> 02:25:37,523
I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me,

1063
02:25:37,731 --> 02:25:43,404
and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name

1064
02:25:43,612 --> 02:25:47,241
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.

1065
02:25:48,742 --> 02:25:54,248
I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly
with your love for our country.

1066
02:25:54,456 --> 02:25:57,167
We'll be in recess until 10 a.m. Monday,

1067
02:25:57,376 --> 02:26:02,089
when we will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges against you.

1068
02:26:02,297 --> 02:26:07,428
At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.

1069
02:26:07,636 --> 02:26:12,099
I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Adjourned!

1070
02:26:15,853 --> 02:26:23,402
Ten-to-one shot, you said.
He would take the Fifth, and I'd lose.

1071
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:28,240
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1072
02:26:29,324 --> 02:26:32,661
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah.

1073
02:26:32,870 --> 02:26:34,997
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1074
02:26:35,205 --> 02:26:38,792
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1075
02:26:39,543 --> 02:26:42,796
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1076
02:26:43,005 --> 02:26:47,134
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1077
02:26:47,342 --> 02:26:52,514
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1078
02:26:53,348 --> 02:26:56,935
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1079
02:26:58,062 --> 02:27:01,815
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1080
02:27:02,024 --> 02:27:05,110
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1081
02:27:05,319 --> 02:27:09,948
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1082
02:27:10,157 --> 02:27:13,035
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1083
02:27:13,243 --> 02:27:15,996
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1084
02:27:16,205 --> 02:27:18,457
Some deal!

1085
02:27:21,085 --> 02:27:24,922
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1086
02:27:26,715 --> 02:27:31,970
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1087
02:27:32,888 --> 02:27:37,267
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.

1088
02:27:37,476 --> 02:27:40,562
He thought you double-crossed him.

1089
02:27:40,771 --> 02:27:44,108
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared,

1090
02:27:44,316 --> 02:27:46,985
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1091
02:27:47,194 --> 02:27:52,366
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1092
02:27:53,158 --> 02:27:58,831
The FBI has him ain'tight. He's on
an army base, 24 hour guards.

1093
02:27:59,081 --> 02:28:04,002
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1094
02:28:06,338 --> 02:28:09,341
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1095
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:13,178
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1096
02:28:13,387 --> 02:28:17,641
Roth, he... played this one beautifully.

1097
02:28:24,982 --> 02:28:27,735
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1098
02:29:07,024 --> 02:29:09,693
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1099
02:29:11,320 --> 02:29:13,781
We have time.

1100
02:29:13,989 --> 02:29:17,076
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1101
02:29:18,452 --> 02:29:21,330
I didn't know all that much.

1102
02:29:21,538 --> 02:29:26,335
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1103
02:29:26,877 --> 02:29:29,671
Anything you can tell me now?

1104
02:29:31,131 --> 02:29:33,759
They've got Pentangeli.

1105
02:29:48,482 --> 02:29:52,152
I didn't know it was going to be
a hit, Mike.

1106
02:29:52,361 --> 02:29:54,613
I swear to God I didn't know.

1107
02:29:57,449 --> 02:30:01,745
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1108
02:30:03,622 --> 02:30:06,625
He said that he wanted to talk.

1109
02:30:08,252 --> 02:30:14,383
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1110
02:30:16,969 --> 02:30:21,140
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1111
02:30:21,348 --> 02:30:25,144
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations,

1112
02:30:25,352 --> 02:30:29,690
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

1113
02:30:31,316 --> 02:30:33,819
...it would be good for the family.

1114
02:30:35,404 --> 02:30:39,867
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1115
02:30:40,075 --> 02:30:43,912
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1116
02:30:44,121 --> 02:30:49,293
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?!

1117
02:30:49,626 --> 02:30:53,338
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1118
02:30:53,547 --> 02:30:58,177
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1119
02:30:58,594 --> 02:31:02,723
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1120
02:31:03,515 --> 02:31:07,895
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

1121
02:31:08,103 --> 02:31:10,939
"Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!"

1122
02:31:11,273 --> 02:31:14,359
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1123
02:31:14,568 --> 02:31:18,906
- It's the way Pop wanted it.
- It's not the way I wanted it!

1124
02:31:19,114 --> 02:31:23,952
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1125
02:31:24,161 --> 02:31:28,040
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1126
02:31:35,714 --> 02:31:40,886
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1127
02:31:48,936 --> 02:31:54,942
The senate lawyer, Questadt...
He belongs to Roth.

1128
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:06,370
Fredo...

1129
02:32:08,789 --> 02:32:11,375
...you're nothing to me now.

1130
02:32:13,335 --> 02:32:15,754
Not a brother, not a friend.

1131
02:32:17,589 --> 02:32:20,592
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1132
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:24,596
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1133
02:32:24,805 --> 02:32:27,349
I don't want you near my house.

1134
02:32:29,351 --> 02:32:33,981
When you see our mother, I want to
know in advance, so I won't be there.

1135
02:32:35,607 --> 02:32:37,985
You understand?

1136
02:32:47,035 --> 02:32:48,954
Mikey.

1137
02:32:55,586 --> 02:33:00,048
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1138
02:33:49,348 --> 02:33:52,810
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1139
02:33:53,018 --> 02:33:57,147
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

1140
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:19,044
This committee will come to order!

1141
02:34:21,797 --> 02:34:24,591
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

1142
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:28,470
- Where were you born?
- Pontenegro, it's outside of Palermo.

1143
02:34:28,679 --> 02:34:30,723
Where do you live now?

1144
02:34:30,931 --> 02:34:36,103
I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.

1145
02:34:37,104 --> 02:34:41,567
We have here a witness
that will further testify

1146
02:34:41,775 --> 02:34:48,115
to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.

1147
02:34:48,407 --> 02:34:53,412
This witness has had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

1148
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:56,498
He can corroborate enough charges

1149
02:34:56,707 --> 02:35:01,336
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.

1150
02:35:01,545 --> 02:35:03,464
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

1151
02:35:04,715 --> 02:35:06,216
Mr Pentangeli...

1152
02:35:07,634 --> 02:35:13,265
Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

1153
02:35:13,474 --> 02:35:18,228
Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,

1154
02:35:18,437 --> 02:35:22,983
and under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?

1155
02:35:28,864 --> 02:35:31,450
I never knew any Godfather.

1156
02:35:34,036 --> 02:35:36,121
I have my own family.

1157
02:35:39,583 --> 02:35:42,086
Mr Pentangeli, you...

1158
02:35:42,294 --> 02:35:46,381
You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.

1159
02:35:46,590 --> 02:35:50,010
I ask you again, sir, here and now
under oath,

1160
02:35:50,219 --> 02:35:56,183
were you at any time a member of a crime
organisation led by Michael Corleone?

1161
02:35:56,934 --> 02:35:59,895
I don't know nothing about that!

1162
02:36:02,940 --> 02:36:06,652
I was in the olive oil business
with his father,

1163
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:09,488
but that was a long time ago.

1164
02:36:10,364 --> 02:36:13,659
We have a sworn affidavit.

1165
02:36:13,867 --> 02:36:19,748
Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.

1166
02:36:19,957 --> 02:36:24,628
Do you deny this confession, and do
you realise what will happen if you do?

1167
02:36:24,837 --> 02:36:27,965
The FBI guys promised me a deal,

1168
02:36:28,173 --> 02:36:33,846
so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.

1169
02:36:34,054 --> 02:36:37,975
But it was all lies. Everything!

1170
02:36:38,726 --> 02:36:40,936
They kept saying,

1171
02:36:41,145 --> 02:36:46,150
"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".

1172
02:36:47,526 --> 02:36:51,488
So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"

1173
02:36:51,697 --> 02:36:57,453
Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?

1174
02:36:57,995 --> 02:37:00,164
I can answer that.

1175
02:37:00,372 --> 02:37:03,459
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1176
02:37:03,667 --> 02:37:07,963
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

1177
02:37:08,464 --> 02:37:13,052
- Will he come forward and be sworn?
- He doesn't understand English.

1178
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:16,930
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1179
02:37:17,139 --> 02:37:20,601
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1180
02:37:20,809 --> 02:37:24,354
- He knows nothing about this?
- To my knowledge, nothing.

1181
02:37:24,605 --> 02:37:29,526
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.

1182
02:37:29,735 --> 02:37:31,820
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

1183
02:37:32,905 --> 02:37:36,533
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1184
02:37:37,117 --> 02:37:41,038
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1185
02:38:08,357 --> 02:38:12,319
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

1186
02:38:12,778 --> 02:38:16,240
The children are outside. We're going.

1187
02:38:17,616 --> 02:38:20,244
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1188
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:23,497
Rocco?

1189
02:38:24,581 --> 02:38:27,126
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1190
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:33,006
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1191
02:38:33,215 --> 02:38:36,635
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1192
02:38:39,638 --> 02:38:42,141
I'm very happy for you.

1193
02:38:42,349 --> 02:38:46,812
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1194
02:38:48,313 --> 02:38:52,860
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, I'm not going to stay long.

1195
02:38:53,068 --> 02:38:56,780
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1196
02:38:56,989 --> 02:39:01,994
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1197
02:39:02,202 --> 02:39:05,205
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1198
02:39:06,415 --> 02:39:11,086
- I wasn't going to say anything...
- What do you mean, "too late"?

1199
02:39:16,508 --> 02:39:19,136
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1200
02:39:24,975 --> 02:39:30,147
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

1201
02:39:30,355 --> 02:39:33,275
Where is he now?

1202
02:39:33,484 --> 02:39:36,111
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1203
02:39:36,820 --> 02:39:39,323
All he had to do was show his face.

1204
02:39:41,033 --> 02:39:45,829
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1205
02:39:53,712 --> 02:39:57,591
<i>Don't tell me you're going.</i>
<i>Not you, not the kids. No.</i>

1206
02:39:58,717 --> 02:40:02,679
<i>You're my wife and my children.</i>
<i>I love you and won't allow it.</i>

1207
02:40:04,014 --> 02:40:07,810
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1208
02:40:08,018 --> 02:40:11,688
Things between men and women
will not change.

1209
02:40:11,897 --> 02:40:15,776
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1210
02:40:15,984 --> 02:40:21,115
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1211
02:40:21,323 --> 02:40:24,493
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

1212
02:40:24,701 --> 02:40:28,580
- Anthony is...
- I don't want to hear about it!

1213
02:40:29,915 --> 02:40:31,959
Over!

1214
02:40:44,012 --> 02:40:48,142
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1215
02:40:48,726 --> 02:40:53,689
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1216
02:41:08,078 --> 02:41:10,122
Kay...

1217
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,127
We're leaving tomorrow.

1218
02:41:15,878 --> 02:41:19,006
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1219
02:41:19,214 --> 02:41:25,012
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

1220
02:41:25,220 --> 02:41:31,560
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1221
02:41:32,394 --> 02:41:37,858
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1222
02:41:38,067 --> 02:41:41,945
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1223
02:41:42,821 --> 02:41:45,157
Don't you know that?

1224
02:41:46,867 --> 02:41:48,702
Kay...

1225
02:41:51,622 --> 02:41:56,210
In time, you'll feel differently.

1226
02:41:57,836 --> 02:42:00,714
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1227
02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:04,760
I know that.

1228
02:42:06,678 --> 02:42:10,057
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1229
02:42:11,934 --> 02:42:13,519
Yes.

1230
02:42:14,269 --> 02:42:16,980
I know what that meant to you.

1231
02:42:19,066 --> 02:42:21,860
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1232
02:42:22,069 --> 02:42:24,905
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1233
02:42:26,198 --> 02:42:28,742
I'm going to change.

1234
02:42:29,743 --> 02:42:33,914
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

1235
02:42:35,958 --> 02:42:38,877
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

1236
02:42:39,753 --> 02:42:44,591
...and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1237
02:42:45,968 --> 02:42:50,097
- We'll go on.
- Oh, Michael!

1238
02:42:51,265 --> 02:42:53,600
Michael, you are blind.

1239
02:42:55,561 --> 02:42:57,855
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1240
02:43:00,190 --> 02:43:01,692
It was an abortion.

1241
02:43:03,527 --> 02:43:08,699
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1242
02:43:09,199 --> 02:43:12,619
Something that's unholy and evil!

1243
02:43:14,413 --> 02:43:17,374
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1244
02:43:17,583 --> 02:43:22,045
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1245
02:43:23,714 --> 02:43:26,008
It was an abortion, Michael.

1246
02:43:26,258 --> 02:43:31,889
It was a son - and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1247
02:43:33,557 --> 02:43:37,561
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1248
02:43:38,896 --> 02:43:44,276
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1249
02:43:44,485 --> 02:43:49,156
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1250
02:43:56,747 --> 02:44:00,042
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1251
02:44:00,250 --> 02:44:04,588
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1252
02:45:34,136 --> 02:45:37,639
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1253
02:47:52,483 --> 02:47:55,319
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1254
02:47:58,697 --> 02:48:01,784
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

1255
02:48:01,992 --> 02:48:05,079
My partner in America, in New York.

1256
02:48:05,287 --> 02:48:07,664
His name is Vito Corleone.

1257
02:48:07,873 --> 02:48:10,626
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1258
02:48:10,834 --> 02:48:12,795
To his company in America.

1259
02:48:17,591 --> 02:48:20,677
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1260
02:48:31,355 --> 02:48:36,860
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1261
02:48:37,611 --> 02:48:40,489
Where is this young man
from New York?

1262
02:48:43,659 --> 02:48:47,246
Have him come closer.

1263
02:48:47,538 --> 02:48:51,125
I can't see him so good.

1264
02:48:57,506 --> 02:49:01,802
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1265
02:49:03,762 --> 02:49:05,889
Bless you!

1266
02:49:07,683 --> 02:49:09,268
What's your name?

1267
02:49:14,398 --> 02:49:17,776
You took the name of this town!

1268
02:49:17,985 --> 02:49:19,862
And what's your father's name?

1269
02:49:20,070 --> 02:49:23,741
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

1270
02:49:23,949 --> 02:49:27,995
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1271
02:49:31,081 --> 02:49:34,460
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1272
02:49:34,668 --> 02:49:37,463
...and this is for you!

1273
02:50:59,044 --> 02:51:01,630
Michael, say goodbye.

1274
02:52:04,985 --> 02:52:07,237
Hi, Al.

1275
02:52:18,373 --> 02:52:21,335
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1276
02:52:29,301 --> 02:52:32,096
Tom, where's Mike?

1277
02:52:32,304 --> 02:52:35,182
Waiting for you to leave.

1278
02:52:36,767 --> 02:52:41,271
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1279
02:52:41,897 --> 02:52:45,150
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1280
02:52:58,288 --> 02:53:00,666
Michael, it's Connie.

1281
02:53:22,146 --> 02:53:24,064
Michael...

1282
02:53:26,692 --> 02:53:31,655
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1283
02:53:38,579 --> 02:53:41,165
Is Kay coming?

1284
02:53:43,751 --> 02:53:45,377
No.

1285
02:53:52,801 --> 02:53:55,971
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1286
02:53:56,180 --> 02:54:00,100
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1287
02:54:03,562 --> 02:54:05,397
That's right.

1288
02:54:08,275 --> 02:54:11,612
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1289
02:54:15,449 --> 02:54:17,785
Please, I want to talk to you.

1290
02:54:29,129 --> 02:54:33,133
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1291
02:54:33,592 --> 02:54:38,889
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know...

1292
02:54:42,184 --> 02:54:44,228
...that I could hurt you.

1293
02:54:50,401 --> 02:54:54,738
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1294
02:54:55,572 --> 02:54:57,991
And I forgive you.

1295
02:55:01,912 --> 02:55:04,706
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1296
02:55:04,915 --> 02:55:09,503
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1297
02:55:15,843 --> 02:55:19,638
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1298
02:55:29,732 --> 02:55:31,775
Connie...

1299
02:57:13,335 --> 02:57:15,879
Tom, sit down.

1300
02:57:27,683 --> 02:57:32,563
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1301
02:57:32,771 --> 02:57:37,401
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in Israel.

1302
02:57:37,985 --> 02:57:42,573
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1303
02:57:42,781 --> 02:57:46,368
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1304
02:57:46,577 --> 02:57:49,288
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1305
02:57:49,496 --> 02:57:54,168
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1306
02:57:54,376 --> 02:57:58,338
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

1307
02:57:58,714 --> 02:58:03,343
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1308
02:58:03,552 --> 02:58:08,223
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1309
02:58:08,432 --> 02:58:11,393
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1310
02:58:11,602 --> 02:58:15,731
- That plane goes to Miami.
- That's right. That's where I want it met.

1311
02:58:16,899 --> 02:58:22,237
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1312
02:58:22,446 --> 02:58:25,532
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1313
02:58:25,741 --> 02:58:31,538
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you surprise me.

1314
02:58:34,583 --> 02:58:38,087
If anything in this life is certain...

1315
02:58:38,295 --> 02:58:41,548
...if history has taught us anything...

1316
02:58:41,757 --> 02:58:44,343
...it's that you can kill anyone.

1317
02:58:49,556 --> 02:58:54,436
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

1318
02:58:54,812 --> 02:58:56,980
Good.

1319
02:58:58,982 --> 02:59:02,569
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1320
02:59:06,281 --> 02:59:12,121
I thought you were going to tell me that
you're moving your family to Vegas...

1321
02:59:13,747 --> 02:59:18,585
...and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1322
02:59:19,545 --> 02:59:24,967
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1323
02:59:28,303 --> 02:59:31,056
- Let's do business.
- All right.

1324
02:59:33,392 --> 02:59:37,312
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1325
02:59:37,521 --> 02:59:42,276
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
Are they worth it, are we strong enough?

1326
02:59:42,901 --> 02:59:47,656
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1327
02:59:47,865 --> 02:59:53,162
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1328
03:00:00,794 --> 03:00:03,464
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1329
03:00:05,591 --> 03:00:11,013
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress,

1330
03:00:11,221 --> 03:00:14,308
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1331
03:00:17,436 --> 03:00:22,441
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1332
03:00:27,071 --> 03:00:29,114
So... you're staying?

1333
03:00:30,949 --> 03:00:33,077
Yes, I'm staying.

1334
03:00:35,746 --> 03:00:38,123
What do you want me to do?

1335
03:00:38,332 --> 03:00:40,334
Hey, Anthony...

1336
03:00:40,751 --> 03:00:45,422
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1337
03:00:45,631 --> 03:00:48,092
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1338
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:50,886
You know, when I was your age...

1339
03:00:51,387 --> 03:00:58,227
...I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1340
03:00:59,436 --> 03:01:02,898
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1341
03:01:03,774 --> 03:01:07,945
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1342
03:01:09,571 --> 03:01:13,325
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1343
03:01:13,534 --> 03:01:17,121
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1344
03:01:19,581 --> 03:01:23,711
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1345
03:01:25,838 --> 03:01:29,633
- Do you want to try it out on the lake?
- Okay.

1346
03:01:29,842 --> 03:01:31,677
What else have you got?

1347
03:01:59,371 --> 03:02:01,915
Everything will be okay.

1348
03:02:02,124 --> 03:02:06,003
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

1349
03:02:06,211 --> 03:02:11,091
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1350
03:02:12,176 --> 03:02:15,345
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1351
03:02:15,554 --> 03:02:20,559
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1352
03:02:20,768 --> 03:02:25,147
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1353
03:02:29,693 --> 03:02:31,570
Tom...

1354
03:02:32,488 --> 03:02:35,032
...what do I do now?

1355
03:02:35,783 --> 03:02:37,743
Frankie...

1356
03:02:42,331 --> 03:02:46,335
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1357
03:02:47,836 --> 03:02:51,256
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1358
03:02:51,465 --> 03:02:55,052
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1359
03:02:57,638 --> 03:03:03,060
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organisation of the families,

1360
03:03:03,268 --> 03:03:08,690
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes", "capos" and "soldiers".

1361
03:03:10,192 --> 03:03:14,196
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

1362
03:03:14,988 --> 03:03:18,450
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1363
03:03:18,659 --> 03:03:21,703
We was like the Roman Empire.

1364
03:03:21,912 --> 03:03:25,332
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1365
03:03:27,793 --> 03:03:29,670
Yeah...

1366
03:03:29,878 --> 03:03:32,256
...it was once.

1367
03:03:36,677 --> 03:03:38,887
Frankie...

1368
03:03:48,689 --> 03:03:52,192
When a plot against the Emperor failed...

1369
03:03:53,527 --> 03:03:56,947
...the plotters were always
given a chance...

1370
03:03:58,907 --> 03:04:02,369
...to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1371
03:04:02,578 --> 03:04:04,621
Only the rich guys.

1372
03:04:04,830 --> 03:04:09,793
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1373
03:04:10,002 --> 03:04:15,174
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1374
03:04:16,383 --> 03:04:20,637
And their families were taken care of.

1375
03:04:22,264 --> 03:04:25,642
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1376
03:04:26,310 --> 03:04:27,770
Yeah.

1377
03:04:28,729 --> 03:04:30,773
They went home...

1378
03:04:32,024 --> 03:04:34,943
...and sat in a hot bath...

1379
03:04:35,152 --> 03:04:37,654
...opened up their veins...

1380
03:04:37,863 --> 03:04:40,532
...and bled to death.

1381
03:04:41,742 --> 03:04:45,871
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1382
03:04:51,085 --> 03:04:54,838
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1383
03:04:55,047 --> 03:04:58,300
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1384
03:05:16,527 --> 03:05:19,196
- See you, Tom.
- <i>Addio,</i> Frankie.

1385
03:05:30,749 --> 03:05:33,836
Kay... You have to go.

1386
03:05:35,212 --> 03:05:39,091
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1387
03:05:47,808 --> 03:05:51,562
Anthony... Kiss Mama goodbye.

1388
03:05:54,231 --> 03:05:56,984
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1389
03:05:57,192 --> 03:06:02,239
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony... I love you, Anthony.

1390
03:06:03,407 --> 03:06:05,784
Kay, please.

1391
03:06:08,704 --> 03:06:10,622
All right.

1392
03:06:23,552 --> 03:06:25,888
Mary, come here.

1393
03:06:33,187 --> 03:06:34,938
Anthony...

1394
03:06:35,147 --> 03:06:38,108
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1395
03:08:17,332 --> 03:08:19,376
Easy.

1396
03:08:25,049 --> 03:08:28,093
Anthony! Anthony!

1397
03:08:28,302 --> 03:08:31,346
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

1398
03:08:31,555 --> 03:08:34,099
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1399
03:08:34,308 --> 03:08:36,268
Shit!

1400
03:08:37,978 --> 03:08:41,398
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1401
03:08:42,608 --> 03:08:46,528
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1402
03:08:50,032 --> 03:08:51,617
Hey, Anthony...

1403
03:08:51,825 --> 03:08:56,163
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1404
03:08:59,249 --> 03:09:00,584
Let's go.

1405
03:09:40,791 --> 03:09:44,920
- Mr Roth, I must take you into custody.
- I understand.

1406
03:09:45,129 --> 03:09:48,215
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1407
03:09:48,424 --> 03:09:51,176
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1408
03:09:51,385 --> 03:09:56,515
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1409
03:10:02,604 --> 03:10:06,191
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1410
03:10:14,408 --> 03:10:16,076
Frankie!

1411
03:10:32,009 --> 03:10:34,845
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1412
03:10:35,054 --> 03:10:38,640
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1413
03:10:38,849 --> 03:10:42,352
I came home to vote
in the presidential election,

1414
03:10:42,561 --> 03:10:45,939
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1415
03:10:58,327 --> 03:11:00,704
Jesus Christ.

1416
03:11:01,789 --> 03:11:06,377
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1417
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:11,090
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1418
03:11:11,298 --> 03:11:14,385
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1419
03:11:15,636 --> 03:11:19,807
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1420
03:12:01,682 --> 03:12:06,854
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1421
03:12:07,730 --> 03:12:10,399
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

1422
03:12:10,607 --> 03:12:15,237
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1423
03:12:15,446 --> 03:12:18,657
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1424
03:12:18,866 --> 03:12:23,328
- Say hello to Carlo. He's good-looking?
- Yes.

1425
03:12:23,537 --> 03:12:27,541
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1426
03:12:28,083 --> 03:12:31,879
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1427
03:12:32,087 --> 03:12:34,298
Hey, Mr Einstein...

1428
03:12:37,676 --> 03:12:40,137
- The cake.
- Sally, get in here!

1429
03:12:40,345 --> 03:12:42,431
- I was scared.
- Come on.

1430
03:12:43,140 --> 03:12:46,435
- Where's your father?
- Christmas shopping.

1431
03:12:46,643 --> 03:12:48,979
Let's see that thing.

1432
03:12:50,397 --> 03:12:52,524
That's nice!

1433
03:12:52,733 --> 03:12:56,570
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1434
03:12:57,696 --> 03:13:00,783
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

1435
03:13:05,829 --> 03:13:09,083
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1436
03:13:09,291 --> 03:13:11,919
He's not ugly...

1437
03:13:17,466 --> 03:13:23,263
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1438
03:13:23,472 --> 03:13:27,101
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1439
03:13:27,309 --> 03:13:29,937
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1440
03:13:30,145 --> 03:13:34,608
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1441
03:13:34,817 --> 03:13:38,404
- 30,000 enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

1442
03:13:38,612 --> 03:13:42,074
- Why are they saps?
- Let's not talk about the war.

1443
03:13:42,282 --> 03:13:44,076
You talk to Carlo.

1444
03:13:46,620 --> 03:13:49,957
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1445
03:13:50,165 --> 03:13:53,669
- That's Pop talking.
- You're right, that's Pop talking!

1446
03:13:53,877 --> 03:13:57,423
- They risk their lives for their country.
- Country isn't your blood.

1447
03:13:57,631 --> 03:14:03,554
- I don't feel that way.
- Then quit college and join the army!

1448
03:14:03,762 --> 03:14:05,222
I did.

1449
03:14:06,640 --> 03:14:09,560
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1450
03:14:11,687 --> 03:14:14,982
- Why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1451
03:14:15,190 --> 03:14:19,403
- Pop managed to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

1452
03:14:19,611 --> 03:14:21,655
I didn't want it.

1453
03:14:23,449 --> 03:14:25,826
Come on! Knock it off!

1454
03:14:26,035 --> 03:14:29,747
- Punk!
- Sonny, sit down.

1455
03:14:32,499 --> 03:14:35,961
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1456
03:14:39,339 --> 03:14:42,051
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1457
03:14:52,019 --> 03:14:54,063
Nice.

1458
03:14:55,564 --> 03:14:57,816
Nice.

1459
03:14:58,025 --> 03:15:01,111
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1460
03:15:01,820 --> 03:15:04,448
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1461
03:15:04,656 --> 03:15:06,784
Don't encourage him!

1462
03:15:06,992 --> 03:15:09,661
Get me a drink. Go on!

1463
03:15:13,457 --> 03:15:16,877
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1464
03:15:17,086 --> 03:15:21,256
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1465
03:15:23,092 --> 03:15:26,887
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1466
03:15:28,222 --> 03:15:32,226
- <i>My</i> future.
- Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1467
03:15:32,434 --> 03:15:38,065
- I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid?

1468
03:15:38,273 --> 03:15:40,150
He's here!

1469
03:15:42,111 --> 03:15:44,029
Come on.

1470
03:15:46,323 --> 03:15:48,242
Stupid!

1471
03:16:05,551 --> 03:16:07,886
<i>Surprise!</i>

1472
03:16:11,014 --> 03:16:16,645
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1473
03:16:16,854 --> 03:16:21,567
<i>That nobody can deny</i>
<i>Nobody can deny...</i>

1474
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:58,074
