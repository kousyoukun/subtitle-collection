2
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,562
The nurse.

3
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,331
- Do you have any money?
- No.

4
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:01,167
Interpreter.

5
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:10,738
Where are you from?

6
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:12,813
- What is your name?
- Maria.

7
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:19,378
What is your name?

8
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:23,019
Come on, son. What is your name?

9
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:29,356
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

10
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,862
Vito Corleone.

11
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:37,427
Okay. Over there.

12
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:40,633
Next. Your name.

13
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:51,380
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine, three months.

14
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,021
Vito Corleone?

15
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,436
Here he is. This is him.

16
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,572
Did you bring the car keys?

17
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:34,677
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

18
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:36,944
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

19
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,645
Nice to meet you. Hi. Excuse me.

20
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:46,784
- Here I am.
- After one week?

21
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:50,387
I sent the car out to the
airport last week to pick you up.

22
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:51,897
It was chaos.

23
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,992
Anyway, here I am, just one week late.

24
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,661
And this is for my mama.

25
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:59,296
- What is this?
- You remember Merle, don't you?

26
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,102
- Hello, Mama.
- Yeah, hello.

27
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,109
How are you? Thank you.

28
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,838
Where's Michael? I gotta talk to him...

29
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:08,245
and get a few things straight,
and I can't wait on line.

30
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,284
You go see your children first...

31
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:14,878
and then you worry about waiting
on line to see your brother...

32
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:17,287
Like everybody else.

33
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:24,960
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Frankie, wake up.

34
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:28,297
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

35
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:32,806
Would you please welcome Senator
Pat Geary of the state of Nevada.

36
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,807
And there's Mrs. Geary.

37
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,852
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

38
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:51,790
And this is a very,
very happy day for me...

39
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:54,361
and my wife, Mrs. Geary.

40
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:58,725
We see Nevada far too seldom...

41
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,926
but particularly today...

42
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:03,731
when we can join with old
friends, we can make new friends...

43
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:07,501
and we help celebrate a
young man's first communion...

44
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:11,469
and also to thank that boy's family...

45
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,673
for a magnificent
contribution to the state.

46
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,883
I have here in my hand a check...

47
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:21,217
made out to the university...

48
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:24,086
and it is a magnificent endowment...

49
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,092
in the name of...

50
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,391
Anthony Vito Corleone.

51
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:34,763
And the check is signed by
that young man's parents...

52
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:37,463
whom I think we should recognize now.

53
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,062
Mike,
Pat, Kay--

54
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:42,074
Stand up, please. Let the folks see you.

55
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:44,235
Folks, I want you to join with me...

56
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:47,212
in giving a real Nevada thank-you...

57
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:50,045
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

58
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,116
We also have, as a
special added attraction...

59
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:01,320
the Sierra Boys Choir...

60
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,897
who have chosen...

61
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:07,832
a certain special song and
a special arrangement...

62
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:11,838
to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.

63
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,033
Boys.

64
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:25,218
- Why this feeling
- Why this feeling

65
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,723
- Why this glow
-Just why this glow

66
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:32,224
The plaque.

67
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,227
Okay, fellas, I got that one.

68
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:38,827
Okay, this is yours.

69
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,833
Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone.

70
00:16:02,924 --> 00:16:04,687
- Excuse me.
- This is my lawyer Tom Hagen.

71
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,692
- Senator Geary.
- Mr. Hagen.

72
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:09,854
He's the one who arranged this whole
thing through your man Turnbull.

73
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:12,194
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

74
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:19,638
I was under the impression
that you and I would talk alone.

75
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:24,270
I trust these men with my life, Senator.

76
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,472
If I were to ask them to
leave, it would be an insult.

77
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:32,016
It's all right with me, but I
should tell you I am a blunt man...

78
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,953
and I intend to speak
very frankly to you...

79
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:40,585
more frankly than anyone in my
position's talked to you before.

80
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:43,357
The Corleone family has done
very well here in Nevada.

81
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:48,834
You own, or you control,
two major hotels in Vegas...

82
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:51,302
one in Reno.

83
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:53,533
The licenses were grandfathered in...

84
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:56,838
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission.

85
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,015
But now my sources tell me that...

86
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:05,643
you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

87
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:08,119
They tell me that within a week...

88
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:10,713
you're gonna move Klingman out.

89
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:12,986
That's quite an expansion.

90
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:16,757
However, it will leave you with
one little technical problem.

91
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:22,268
The license will still
be in Klingman's name.

92
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,270
Turnbull is a good man.

93
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:28,342
Yeah, well, let's just--
Let's cut out the bullshit.

94
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:31,606
I don't want to spend any
more time here than I have to.

95
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:34,180
You can have the license.

96
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,512
The price is $250,000...

97
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:39,586
plus a monthly payment of
five percent of the gross...

98
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,382
of all four hotels...

99
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:44,253
Mr. Corleone.

100
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:51,962
Now, the price for the
license is less than $20,000.

101
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,966
- Am I right?
- That's right.

102
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:57,801
Now, why would I ever
consider paying more than that?

103
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:01,102
Because I intend to squeeze you.

104
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,803
I don't like your kind of people.

105
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:06,106
I don't like to see you come
out to this clean country...

106
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:08,045
in your oily hair...

107
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:11,816
dressed up in those silk suits...

108
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,878
and you try to pass yourselves
off as decent Americans.

109
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,891
I'll do business with you,
but the fact is that...

110
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:21,791
I despise your masquerade...

111
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:24,831
the dishonest way
you pose yourself--

112
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,127
yourself and your whole fucking family.

113
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,706
Senator...

114
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:40,110
we're both part of the same hypocrisy...

115
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,579
but never think it applies to my family.

116
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:48,280
All right, all right.

117
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:52,851
Some people have to play little games.

118
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,518
You play yours.

119
00:18:57,231 --> 00:19:00,860
Let's just say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest to.

120
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:04,896
But I want your answer and
the money by noon tomorrow.

121
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:09,272
And one more thing: Don't
you contact me again, ever.

122
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:13,336
From now on, you deal with
Turnbull. Open that door, son.

123
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:17,806
Senator, you can have my
answer now if you like.

124
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:23,686
My offer is this:

125
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,190
nothing.

126
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:28,828
Not even the fee for
the gaming license...

127
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,457
which I would appreciate if
you would put up personally.

128
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,597
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

129
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,604
Ladies. I didn't know you were out here.

130
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:48,841
- We have to go. We're late.
- Really? I'm sorry.

131
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,544
It's been a delightful party.
Thank you for inviting us.

132
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:55,019
It's been our pleasure. It
was wonderful talking to you.

133
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:42,995
Fredo, you son ofa bitch!

134
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,867
You look great!

135
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:46,837
Frank Pentangeli!

136
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:49,671
I thought you was never
coming out west, you big bum.

137
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:53,404
I gotta check on my boys, huh?

138
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:57,207
- What's with the food around here?
- What's the matter?

139
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,945
Kid comes up to me in a white jacket...

140
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:01,248
gives me a Ritz cracker
and a chopped liver...

141
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:03,084
he says "canapes."

142
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,250
I said, "Can of peas my ass!

143
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,624
That's a Ritz cracker
and chopped liver."

144
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,893
- Bring out the peppers and sausage.
- Hey, Freddie.

145
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:18,631
Seeing you reminds me of
New York. The old days, huh?

146
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,072
Hey, Fredo, you remember Willi Cicci?

147
00:21:22,176 --> 00:21:24,474
We was with old man
Clemenza in Brooklyn.

148
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:29,712
We were all upset about that.

149
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,148
Heart attack, huh?

150
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:33,152
No, there was no heart attack.

151
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:38,847
That's what I'm here to
see your brother Mike about.

152
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,894
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

153
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,964
I mean, what do I gotta
do? Do I have to get...

154
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:47,432
a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

155
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:49,002
You can't get in to see Mike?

156
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:51,867
He's got me waiting in a lobby!

157
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:57,840
-Johnny Ola.
- AI Neri.

158
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:05,908
Do you know my lawyer
Tom Hagen? Johnny Ola.

159
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,649
Sure. I remember Tom from the old days.

160
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:12,692
Rocco, what's this?

161
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:15,523
It's an orange from Miami.

162
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:18,427
Take care of Johnny's men. They
look like they might be hungry.

163
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:23,835
- Good to see you.
- Tom isn't gonna sit in with us.

164
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:26,566
He only handles specifiic
areas of the family business.

165
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:28,574
- Tom?
- Sure, Mike.

166
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:35,845
What are you drinking, Johnny?

167
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,349
Anisette.

168
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:44,821
If you need anything I'll
be outside, all right?

169
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:46,825
Just tell Rocco we're waiting.

170
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,425
I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.

171
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:58,232
- How's his health?
- It's not good.

172
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:02,903
Is there anything I can
do, anything I can send?

173
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,468
He appreciates your concern,
Michael, and your respect.

174
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:11,176
That casino you're interested
in, the registered owners are...

175
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:15,312
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay,
both Beverly Hills attorneys.

176
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:18,358
The real owners are the Lakeville
Road group from Cleveland...

177
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,893
and our friend in Miami.

178
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,553
Meyer Klingman runs the store.

179
00:23:22,663 --> 00:23:25,325
He owns a piece of it
too, and he does all right.

180
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:28,231
But I've been instructed to tell
you that if you move Klingman out...

181
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:30,735
our friend in Miami will go along.

182
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,598
That's very kind of him.

183
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,939
You tell him that's greatly appreciated.

184
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,306
Hyman Roth always makes
money for his partners.

185
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,650
One by one, our old friends are gone.

186
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:52,089
Death, natural or not...

187
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:54,354
prison, deported.

188
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:58,663
Hyman Roth is the only one left...

189
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:01,997
because he always made
money for his partners.

190
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:04,434
My God! I can't believe...

191
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:06,631
out of 30 professional musicians...

192
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,174
there isn't one ltalian
in the group here.

193
00:24:09,276 --> 00:24:11,176
Come on. Let's have a tarantella.

194
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:19,676
You, up! Come on! Up, up, up!

195
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:55,714
I'll see my sister alone.

196
00:24:55,823 --> 00:24:58,724
It concerns me too.
Is it okay if I stay?

197
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,555
How are you, honey?

198
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:03,789
You've met Merle. He
was with me in Vegas.

199
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:06,731
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink or something?

200
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:13,203
Al, would you please get him a drink?

201
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:19,210
We're going to Europe. I'd like
to book passage on the Queen.

202
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:22,077
So what do you come to me for?
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

203
00:25:22,182 --> 00:25:24,013
We're getting married first.

204
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:36,688
The ink on your divorce isn't dry
yet, and you're getting married?

205
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,660
You see your children on weekends.

206
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,170
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno...

207
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:47,502
for some petty theft you
don't even know about.

208
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:50,736
You fly around the world with
men who use you like a whore.

209
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:53,540
- You're not my father!
- Then what do you come to me for?

210
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:55,171
'Cause I need money.

211
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:19,905
I wanna be reasonable with you.

212
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,941
Now, why don't you stay here
with us, with the family?

213
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,309
You can live here on the
estate with your kids.

214
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:31,907
You won't be deprived of anything.
You can have everything you want.

215
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:39,287
Now, I don't know this Merle.
I don't know what he does.

216
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:41,293
I don't know what he lives on.

217
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,930
Tell him marriage is
out ofthe question...

218
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:48,092
and you don't want to see him anymore.

219
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:50,636
He'll understand. Believe me.

220
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,382
If you don't listen to me...

221
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,386
and marry this man...

222
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:13,753
you'll disappoint me.

223
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:52,428
What's cent'anni?

224
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,501
Cent'anni. It means a hundred years.

225
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:59,732
It means we should all live happily
for a hundred years, the family.

226
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,671
It'd be true if my father were alive.

227
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,375
Merle, you've met my
sister-in-law Deanna.

228
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:11,075
- Fredo's wife.
- A pleasure, Merle.

229
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:13,085
- How do you do?
- My pleasure.

230
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:17,913
What did she mean by that?

231
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,259
What's the matter? I just wanna dance.

232
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:03,461
Dancing is one thing. You're
falling all over the floor.

233
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,267
I know what's the matter. You're
jealous 'cause he's a real man.

234
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:10,434
I swear to God, I'm gonna
belt you right in the teeth.

235
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:12,136
You couldn't belt your mama.

236
00:29:13,313 --> 00:29:16,214
You know something? These dagos are
crazy when it comes to their wives.

237
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:19,251
Michael says that if you
can't take care of this...

238
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:21,685
I have to.

239
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,587
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop!

240
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:27,592
They treat their wives like
shit! I didn't mean to say Wop!

241
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:30,619
Stop that!

242
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:32,824
What are you doing to me?

243
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:35,333
You big slob! Help!

244
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,560
I can't control her, Mikey.

245
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:42,164
You're my brother, Fredo. You
don't have to apologize to me.

246
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:47,913
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers...

247
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:50,006
three territories in
the Bronx after he died.

248
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:52,085
You took over, and you
didn't give it to them.

249
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:53,346
- I welched?
- You welched.

250
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:56,422
Clemenza promised them "ugatz. "

251
00:29:56,523 --> 00:29:58,286
Clemenza promised them nothing.

252
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:00,622
He hated those son ofa
bitches more than I do.

253
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:03,855
Frankie, they feel cheated.

254
00:30:03,964 --> 00:30:07,525
You're sitting high up
in the Sierra Mountains...

255
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:09,033
and you're
drinking--

256
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:10,865
- What's he drinking, Cicci?
- Champagne.

257
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:12,962
Champagne cocktails.

258
00:30:13,073 --> 00:30:15,132
And you're passing judgment
on how I run my family.

259
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:41,530
You're a good old man.

260
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:43,227
I like you.

261
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,130
And you were loyal to
my father for years.

262
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:51,669
The Rosato brothers,
they're taking hostages.

263
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:56,578
And Mike, they spit right in my face...

264
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:59,083
all because they're backed
up by that Jew in Miami.

265
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:02,178
I know. That's why I
don't want 'em touched.

266
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:03,347
- You don't want 'em touched.
- No.

267
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:06,017
I want you to be fair with them.

268
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:08,094
You want me to be fair with 'em?

269
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,291
How can you be fair to animals?

270
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:13,798
Tom, for Christ's sakes, listen.

271
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:17,428
They recruit spics.
They recruit niggers.

272
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:21,530
And they do violence in their
grandmothers' neighborhoods.

273
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:24,270
And I tell ya, everything
with them is whores.

274
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:27,836
Whores and junk. Dope.

275
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:30,610
And they leave the gambling to last.

276
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:33,777
Now, I wanna run my family
without you on my back...

277
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,913
and I want those Rosato brothers dead.

278
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:47,695
Now, I have business that's
important with Hyman Roth.

279
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,063
I don't want it disturbed.

280
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:53,297
Then you'll give your loyalty
to a Jew before your own blood?

281
00:31:57,678 --> 00:32:00,772
Come on. You know my father
did business with Hyman Roth.

282
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,371
He respected him.

283
00:32:02,482 --> 00:32:05,212
Your father did business
with Hyman Roth...

284
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,719
your father respected Hyman Roth...

285
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:10,255
but your father never
trusted Hyman Roth...

286
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:14,157
or his Sicilian
messenger boy Johnny Ola.

287
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:24,435
And I want everybody here to know...

288
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:27,564
there's not gonna be no trouble from me.

289
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:29,608
Don Corleone.

290
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:41,887
You want him to leave now?

291
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:47,991
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

292
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:51,963
The old man had too much wine.

293
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,297
It's late.

294
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,143
How's the baby?

295
00:33:13,253 --> 00:33:16,086
Sleeping inside me.

296
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:19,989
- Does it feel like a boy?
- Yes, it does, Michael.

297
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:27,589
I'm sorry about all the people today.

298
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,362
Bad timing.

299
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:31,869
It couldn't be helped, though.

300
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:34,600
It made me think of
what you once told me.

301
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:41,407
In five years, the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate.

302
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:43,415
That was seven years ago.

303
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:49,048
I know.

304
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,714
I'm trying, darling.

305
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:55,654
Did you see this?

306
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:13,470
Michael, why are the drapes open?

307
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,497
- Kay, you all right?
- Yeah.

308
00:35:42,602 --> 00:35:45,127
- Are you hit?
- No.

309
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,372
It's over. It's over.

310
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:53,846
Now! Shut it off!

311
00:35:55,515 --> 00:35:57,176
Hold it!

312
00:36:07,961 --> 00:36:11,761
They're still on the
property. Please, stay inside.

313
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,389
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

314
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,660
Rocco! Alive!

315
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,670
Stay by the door.

316
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,237
Check by the boathouse!

317
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:39,843
Yeah, come in.

318
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,089
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

319
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:50,594
Yeah?

320
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,432
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

321
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,167
Now, I know that's
upset you in the past.

322
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,807
You felt it was because of some
lack of trust or confidence...

323
00:38:10,383 --> 00:38:13,716
but it's because I admire
you and I love you...

324
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,754
that I kept things secret from you.

325
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,983
That's why at this moment you're
the only one I can completely trust.

326
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:25,631
Fredo?

327
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:28,667
Well, he's got a good heart...

328
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:30,793
but he's weak and he's stupid...

329
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:32,804
and this is life and death.

330
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:37,374
Tom, you're my brother.

331
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:46,309
I always wanted to be thought
of as a brother by you.

332
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:47,943
A real brother.

333
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:52,515
I know that.

334
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:01,692
You're gonna take over.

335
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:04,167
You're gonna be the don.

336
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,637
If what I think has
happened has happened...

337
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:12,507
I'm gonna leave here tonight.

338
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:17,274
I give you complete power
over Fredo and his men--

339
00:39:17,384 --> 00:39:19,477
Rocco, Neri, everyone.

340
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:26,855
I'm trusting you with the lives
of my wife and my children--

341
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,518
the future of this family.

342
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:33,059
When we catch these guys...

343
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,963
do you think we'll be able to
find out who's back ofall this?

344
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,263
We're not gonna catch 'em.

345
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:41,071
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

346
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,841
They were killed by
somebody close to us.

347
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:48,504
Inside.

348
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:51,243
Very, very frightened they botched it.

349
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:53,649
Yeah, but your people, Rocco and Neri...

350
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:55,914
you don't think that they
had something to do with this?

351
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:03,852
See, all our people are businessmen.

352
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:07,255
Their loyalty's based on that.

353
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:12,904
One thing I learned from Pop...

354
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:18,137
was to try to think as
people around you think.

355
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,606
Now, on that basis, anything's possible.

356
00:40:25,452 --> 00:40:29,252
I seen them! Right out my window!

357
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:32,051
I wanna get out of here!
They're lying there dead!

358
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:33,455
Get her inside!

359
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,639
Over here. There's two of'em.

360
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,536
Looks like they were
hired out of New York.

361
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:50,905
I don't recognize 'em.

362
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,241
We won't get anything out of them now.

363
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:55,905
Fish 'em out.

364
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:23,340
All right, get rid of the bodies.

365
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:25,434
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

366
00:41:56,476 --> 00:42:00,105
Anthony, everything's
gonna be all right.

367
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:01,771
Try to sleep.

368
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:20,729
Did you like your party?

369
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,391
I got lots of presents.

370
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:26,268
I know. Did you like 'em?

371
00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:29,034
I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

372
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:32,376
Well, they're my friends.

373
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:36,640
Did you see my present for you?

374
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:38,614
It was on my pillow.

375
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:44,287
Anthony, I'm going to be
leaving very early tomorrow.

376
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:47,583
Will you take me?

377
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:51,027
- No, I can't, Anthony.
- Why do you have to go?

378
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:55,266
'Cause I have to do business.

379
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:57,268
I could help you.

380
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:03,374
Well, someday you will.

381
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:07,069
Get some sleep.

382
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:17,546
Good night.

383
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:43,446
Vito. Come on.

384
00:47:45,758 --> 00:47:47,658
We'll go see her backstage.

385
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:58,227
Come here.

386
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:44,039
Vito. Come here. Come on.

387
00:48:47,687 --> 00:48:49,245
Come here.

388
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:28,577
You speak ltalian?

389
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,732
Yeah, sure.

390
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:53,703
Come on in.

391
01:01:55,574 --> 01:01:58,475
It's all right. Come
on. Hyman's in there.

392
01:01:58,577 --> 01:02:01,546
I was just making some lunch.
Would you like a tuna sandwich?

393
01:02:01,646 --> 01:02:03,546
Uh, no, thankyou.

394
01:02:09,187 --> 01:02:11,985
Pickup of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...

395
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,422
and the ball is at
the Trojan 38-yardline.

396
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:15,754
Mr. Roth?

397
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:17,761
Come in, Michael.

398
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:22,698
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

399
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:26,660
It's almost over.

400
01:02:29,107 --> 01:02:30,631
You follow the football game?

401
01:02:30,742 --> 01:02:34,109
- Pickup offive.
- Not for a while I haven't.

402
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:37,045
I enjoy watching
football in the afternoon.

403
01:02:37,149 --> 01:02:40,084
One of the things I
love about this country.

404
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:42,278
Baseball too.

405
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:44,252
I've loved baseball...

406
01:02:44,356 --> 01:02:48,383
ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

407
01:02:48,493 --> 01:02:51,894
...47. Marked down
there, say the officials.

408
01:02:51,997 --> 01:02:54,591
And at that point
it'll be first and ten--

409
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:56,257
I heard you had some trouble.

410
01:02:56,368 --> 01:02:59,303
It'll be third and ten, another
of those big plays now...

411
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:02,066
- Stupid.
- coming up for S.C.

412
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:04,438
People behaving like that with guns.

413
01:03:04,543 --> 01:03:07,103
...but it looks like
it could stall here.

414
01:03:07,212 --> 01:03:09,976
The important thing
is, you're all right.

415
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:14,040
Good health. The most important thing.

416
01:03:14,152 --> 01:03:16,677
More than success. More than money.

417
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:19,552
- Now he's back to pass.
- More than power.

418
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,751
Rolls up field for
Hayes. He's intercepted.

419
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:27,526
Hurd has it to the lrish 40. To
the far sideline. Gets by the 45.

420
01:03:27,632 --> 01:03:32,001
He's hit and dropped
at the S.C. 42-yardline.

421
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:34,731
Notre Dame's first bigbreak of the game.

422
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,640
I came here because there's
gonna be more bloodshed.

423
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:41,075
I want you to know about
it before it happens...

424
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:43,647
so that there's no danger
of starting another war.

425
01:03:43,748 --> 01:03:46,774
Nobody wants another war.

426
01:03:46,885 --> 01:03:50,548
Frank Pentangeli came to my home
and he asked my permission...

427
01:03:50,655 --> 01:03:52,179
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

428
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,622
When I refused, he
tried to have me killed.

429
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:58,218
He was stupid. I was
lucky. I'll visit him soon.

430
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,629
The important thing is
that nothing interfere...

431
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:03,633
with our plans for the future.

432
01:04:03,735 --> 01:04:07,432
- Yours and mine.
- Nothing is more important.

433
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,029
Good.

434
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:12,041
You're a wise and considerate young man.

435
01:04:12,143 --> 01:04:15,010
And you're a great man, Mr. Roth.

436
01:04:15,113 --> 01:04:19,140
- There's much I can learn from you.
- What can I do to help, Michael?

437
01:04:19,251 --> 01:04:22,084
To the 32, and is downed
there by Danny Zika.

438
01:04:22,187 --> 01:04:24,678
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Oh.

439
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:26,689
- Okay.
- Ohh!

440
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:29,692
Hyman, you're gonna break my ear drums.

441
01:04:30,929 --> 01:04:32,988
- Okay, enjoy it.
- Thanks.

442
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:42,936
You're young. I'm old and sick.

443
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:45,839
What we'll do together
in the next few months...

444
01:04:45,944 --> 01:04:48,071
will make history, Michael.

445
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:51,080
History. It's never been done before.

446
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:55,516
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

447
01:04:57,689 --> 01:05:00,522
And Pentangeli is a dead man.

448
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,685
- You don't object?
- Pickup of four.

449
01:05:03,795 --> 01:05:05,695
He's small potatoes.

450
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:18,968
What's up?

451
01:05:21,146 --> 01:05:23,046
We got company, huh?

452
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,188
Don Corleone, I wish you would've
let me know you were comin'.

453
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,788
I could've prepared something for you.

454
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:11,800
I didn't want you to know I was coming.

455
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:19,836
You heard what happened in my home?

456
01:06:19,944 --> 01:06:23,880
- Mike, I almost died myself.
- In my home!

457
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:30,252
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

458
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:36,991
Where my children come
and play with their toys.

459
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:38,994
In my home.

460
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:59,173
I want you to help me take my revenge.

461
01:06:59,283 --> 01:07:01,308
Michael, anything.

462
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:03,318
What can I do?

463
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:09,356
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

464
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,088
Mike, I don't
understand. I don't--

465
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:14,926
I don't have your brain for big deals...

466
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:16,761
but this is a street thing.

467
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:19,995
That Hyman Roth
in Miami. That--

468
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:22,231
He's backin' up those
son-of-a-bitches.

469
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:23,271
I know.

470
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:26,707
Then why? Why do you ask
me to lay down to him, Mike?

471
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:36,184
It was Hyman Roth that
tried to have me killed.

472
01:07:37,988 --> 01:07:41,116
I know it was him.

473
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:43,591
Jesus Christ, Mike.

474
01:07:43,694 --> 01:07:45,594
Jesus Christ, look, let's get 'em all.

475
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:48,995
Let's hit 'em all now,
while we got the muscle.

476
01:07:53,671 --> 01:07:56,071
This used to be my father's old study.

477
01:07:57,675 --> 01:07:59,575
It's changed.

478
01:08:00,978 --> 01:08:03,412
I remember there
used to be a--

479
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,414
A big desk was here.

480
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:10,319
I remember when I was a kid, Frankie...

481
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:12,821
we had to be very quiet
when we played near here.

482
01:08:21,031 --> 01:08:24,432
I was very happy that this
house never went to strangers.

483
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:29,299
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

484
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,571
My father taught me many things here.

485
01:08:34,678 --> 01:08:37,078
He taught me in this room.

486
01:08:40,351 --> 01:08:43,946
He taught me, keep your friends close...

487
01:08:44,054 --> 01:08:46,352
but your enemies closer.

488
01:08:46,457 --> 01:08:49,858
Now, if Hyman Roth sees that
I interceded in this thing...

489
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,827
in the Rosato brothers' favor...

490
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:55,728
he's gonna think his relationship
with me is still good.

491
01:08:59,203 --> 01:09:02,297
That's what I want him to think.

492
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:07,105
I want him completely relaxed
and confident in our friendship.

493
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:11,113
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

494
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:42,872
- Yeah?
- Fredo. This is Johnny.

495
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,380
Johnny Ola. We need some more help.

496
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:47,643
Johnny?

497
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,652
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

498
01:09:50,754 --> 01:09:53,723
- Who is that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

499
01:09:53,824 --> 01:09:56,850
What are you callin' me here
for? I don't want to talk to you.

500
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,190
Pentangeli's set up a meeting
with the Rosato brothers.

501
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:01,628
- He's gonna go for their deal.
- Oh, God.

502
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:04,257
- Will he come alone?
- I don't know anything.

503
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:06,928
- You got me in deep enough already.
- Just go along.

504
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:09,028
Everything will be allright, Fredo.

505
01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:11,437
Pentangeli says he's
willing to make a deal.

506
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,443
All we wanna know is
if he's on the level.

507
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:19,072
You guys lied to me. I don't
want you to call me anymore.

508
01:10:19,183 --> 01:10:21,651
Your brother's not
gonna find out we talked.

509
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:24,653
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

510
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:36,531
Who was that?

511
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:38,533
Uh, wrong number.

512
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:48,644
Frank, I got nobody here.

513
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:50,646
- Wait in the car,
Cheech. - Frankie--

514
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:52,648
It's okay, Cheech.

515
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:03,191
- What's this, Rosato?
- A lucky "C" note for our new deal.

516
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:09,030
Richie. Give us a taste, huh?

517
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:17,663
Yeah, we're all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

518
01:11:17,775 --> 01:11:22,212
- You're not gonna regret it.
- I don't like this "C" note.

519
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:24,780
I take that as an insult.

520
01:11:24,882 --> 01:11:27,112
Michael Corleone says hello.

521
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:47,295
Get him in! Close the fuckin' door!

522
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:49,804
Your friend the
cop. What the--

523
01:11:49,907 --> 01:11:52,637
Hey, Rich, it's dark in here.

524
01:11:52,743 --> 01:11:57,146
- Are you open or closed?
- I just come in to clean up.

525
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:02,849
What's the matter?

526
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:05,922
- Is that somethin' on the floor?
- Carmine, no, no. Not here!

527
01:12:06,023 --> 01:12:08,491
- Not here!
- Not here, Carmine! Not a cop!

528
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:10,492
What?

529
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:14,052
You open your fuckin' mouth,
I'll blow your head off!

530
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:01,943
Freddie. Good to see ya.

531
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:06,748
Where is he?

532
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:09,512
He's okay. He's in the back.

533
01:13:13,524 --> 01:13:15,924
Come on, girls. Take a hike, huh?

534
01:13:19,029 --> 01:13:20,929
In this room here.

535
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,860
- I wanna talk to him alone first.
- Come on, huh?

536
01:13:36,046 --> 01:13:38,981
I thought I could help you, Senator.

537
01:13:42,853 --> 01:13:45,117
Hagen?

538
01:13:45,956 --> 01:13:49,016
- Listen, Hagen,
I did not-- - No.

539
01:13:49,126 --> 01:13:51,185
- It's all right.
- I didn't do anything.

540
01:13:51,295 --> 01:13:53,422
It's okay.

541
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:55,794
You're very lucky.

542
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:58,367
My brother Fredo operates this place.

543
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:01,266
He was called before anyone.

544
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:03,100
Now, if this had
happened someplace else...

545
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:04,264
we couldn't have helped you.

546
01:14:08,345 --> 01:14:12,782
When I woke up I was on the floor...

547
01:14:12,883 --> 01:14:14,783
and I don't know how it happened.

548
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:16,785
You can't remember?

549
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:22,549
I passed out.

550
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,365
I'll fix it.

551
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,435
Okay.

552
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:40,804
It was just a game.

553
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:42,310
Jesus.

554
01:14:45,082 --> 01:14:46,982
Oh.

555
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:54,583
Jesus! Jesus!

556
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:01,759
Jesus God.

557
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,799
Oh, God.

558
01:15:06,136 --> 01:15:09,833
I don't know and I don't
understand why I can't remember.

559
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,773
You don't have to
remember. Just do as I say.

560
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:15,470
They're putting a
call in to your office.

561
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:19,515
Explain that you'll be
there tomorrow afternoon.

562
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:21,743
You decided to spend the night...

563
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:25,754
at Michael Corleone's
house in Tahoe as his guest.

564
01:15:26,456 --> 01:15:29,357
I do remember that she was laughing.

565
01:15:31,328 --> 01:15:33,228
We'd done it before...

566
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:36,663
and I know that I could
not have hurt that girl.

567
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:39,701
This girl has no family.

568
01:15:39,803 --> 01:15:41,794
Nobody knows that she worked here.

569
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:44,373
It'll be as though she never existed.

570
01:15:47,077 --> 01:15:49,477
All that's left is our friendship.

571
01:16:05,195 --> 01:16:07,095
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.

572
01:16:07,197 --> 01:16:11,156
- We're not to let you through.
- I'm just going to the market.

573
01:16:11,268 --> 01:16:13,828
Well, if you'll just give us a list,
we'll pick up anything you want.

574
01:16:13,937 --> 01:16:17,168
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. He's coming.

575
01:16:17,274 --> 01:16:20,402
All right, well, I'm just gonna
have to speak to Mr. Hagen.

576
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:29,344
I wanted to explain this, but
I had business in Carson City.

577
01:16:29,453 --> 01:16:31,478
Now, this is Michael's
request for your safety.

578
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:34,182
- We can send out for anything.
- I see.

579
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:36,259
I'm supposed to stay in my house.

580
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:38,850
No, within the compound would be fine.

581
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:41,226
I was going to take the children
to New England next week.

582
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:44,562
- That's off now.
- Am I a prisoner? ls that it?

583
01:16:44,668 --> 01:16:47,136
- That's not the way we look at it.
- All right, come on, kids.

584
01:16:47,237 --> 01:16:49,137
We're going back to the house.

585
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:53,408
Joe.

586
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:40,917
Cuba! Cuba!

587
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:25,000
Most respected gentlemen...

588
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:27,262
allow me to welcome you
to the city of Havana.

589
01:18:29,406 --> 01:18:34,400
I want to thank this distinguished
group of American industrialists...

590
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:38,346
for continuing to work with Cuba...

591
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:42,311
toward the greatest
period of prosperity...

592
01:18:43,954 --> 01:18:45,854
in her entire history.

593
01:18:47,357 --> 01:18:51,350
Mr. William Shaw, representing
the General Fruit Company;

594
01:18:53,263 --> 01:18:55,128
Misters Corngold and Dant...

595
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:58,030
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company;

596
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:02,567
Mr. Petty, regional vice president...

597
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:05,072
of the Pan American Mining Corporation;

598
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:09,972
Mr. Robert Allen of
South American Sugar;,

599
01:19:12,315 --> 01:19:14,442
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada...

600
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,618
representing our associates in
tourism and leisure activities;

601
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:24,058
and my old friend and
associate from Florida...

602
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:28,357
Mr. Hyman Roth.

603
01:19:28,465 --> 01:19:30,228
I would like to take this opportunity...

604
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,198
to thank United
Telephone and Telegraph...

605
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:34,202
for their lovely Christmas gift:

606
01:19:38,842 --> 01:19:40,742
a solid gold telephone.

607
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,381
Perhaps you gentlemen would
like to take a look at it.

608
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:49,613
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

609
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:52,779
Perhaps you would discuss the
status of rebel activity...

610
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:55,619
and what this can
mean to our businesses.

611
01:19:55,725 --> 01:19:57,192
- Of course.
- Very lovely.

612
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:59,762
I want to assure you that
although the rebels...

613
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:03,060
have mounted an impressive
campaign in Las Villas...

614
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,604
my staff indicates with assurance...

615
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:16,611
we'll drive them out of the city
of Santa Clara before the new year.

616
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:21,775
And I want to put you all at ease.

617
01:20:21,885 --> 01:20:25,787
We will tolerate no guerillas
in the casinos or swimming pools.

618
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,574
He say that they are making arrest...

619
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:49,577
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

620
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:52,172
Johnny.

621
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,832
Well, I hope my age is correct.

622
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:21,035
I'm always accurate about my age.

623
01:21:21,144 --> 01:21:24,705
Make sure that everybody sees
the cake before we cut it.

624
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:31,247
I'm very pleased...

625
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:34,255
you were all able to come
from such distances...

626
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:35,551
to be with me today.

627
01:21:37,494 --> 01:21:40,190
When a man comes to
this point in his life...

628
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:45,167
he wants to turn over the
things he's been blessed with--

629
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:47,259
turn them over
to friends--

630
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:51,602
as a reward for the friends he's had...

631
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:56,941
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

632
01:21:57,047 --> 01:21:59,709
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear.

633
01:21:59,816 --> 01:22:03,650
The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

634
01:22:05,155 --> 01:22:10,183
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana...

635
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:13,353
and there's no limit to
where we can go from here.

636
01:22:13,463 --> 01:22:18,230
This kind of government knows how
to help business, to encourage it.

637
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:22,361
The hotels here are
bigger and swankier...

638
01:22:22,472 --> 01:22:25,100
than any of the rough
joints we've put in in Vegas.

639
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:28,541
And we can thank our friends
in the Cuban government...

640
01:22:28,645 --> 01:22:31,637
which has put up half of the
cash, with the Teamsters...

641
01:22:31,748 --> 01:22:33,272
on a dollar-for-dollar
basis;

642
01:22:33,383 --> 01:22:36,216
has relaxed restrictions on imports.

643
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:40,722
What I'm saying is that we have
now what we have always needed:

644
01:22:40,824 --> 01:22:43,588
real partnership with a government.

645
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:46,287
Smaller piece.

646
01:22:46,396 --> 01:22:48,956
You all know Michael Corleone...

647
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:51,295
and we all remember his father.

648
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:55,030
At the time of my retirement or death...

649
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:59,598
I turn over all my interest
in the Havana operation...

650
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:00,937
to his control.

651
01:23:01,044 --> 01:23:05,105
But all of you will share.

652
01:23:05,215 --> 01:23:08,912
The Nacionale will go to
the Lakeville Road boys.

653
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:14,888
The Capri to the Corleone
family. The Sevilla Biltmore also.

654
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:18,859
But Eddie Levine of Newport will
bring in the Pennino brothers...

655
01:23:18,962 --> 01:23:20,725
Dino and Eddie, for a piece...

656
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:23,663
and also to handle the
actual casino operations.

657
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:27,293
And we've saved a piece for
some friends in Nevada...

658
01:23:27,403 --> 01:23:31,066
to make sure that things
go smooth back home.

659
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:36,134
I want all of you to enjoy your cake...

660
01:23:36,246 --> 01:23:38,146
so enjoy.

661
01:23:38,248 --> 01:23:40,148
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

662
01:23:41,985 --> 01:23:45,944
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

663
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:49,183
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police...

664
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:51,055
and rather than be taken alive...

665
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:53,789
he exploded a grenade he
had hidden in his jacket.

666
01:23:53,897 --> 01:23:57,298
He killed himself, and he took a
captain of the command with him.

667
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,595
- Right,Johnny?
- Those rebels, they're lunatics.

668
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,967
- Yes, I agree.
- Maybe so.

669
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:04,664
But it occurred to me...

670
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:08,107
the soldiers are paid to
fight, the rebels aren't.

671
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:10,372
What does that tell you?

672
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,380
They could win.

673
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:17,015
This country has had rebels
for the last 50 years.

674
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,750
It's in their blood. I've been
coming here since the '20s.

675
01:24:21,858 --> 01:24:25,692
We were running molasses out of
Havana when you were a baby...

676
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:29,390
the trucks owned by your father.

677
01:24:29,499 --> 01:24:31,967
Michael.

678
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,975
I'd rather we talked about
this when we we're alone.

679
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:46,814
The two million never got to the island.

680
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:55,783
I wouldn't want it to get around
that you held back the money...

681
01:24:55,892 --> 01:24:59,259
because you had second
thoughts about the rebels.

682
01:25:04,634 --> 01:25:07,569
Ah, sit down, Michael.

683
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,570
Sit down.

684
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:19,879
If I could only live to see
it, to be there with you.

685
01:25:19,983 --> 01:25:22,315
Ohh.

686
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:24,886
What I wouldn't give for...

687
01:25:24,988 --> 01:25:26,888
20 more years.

688
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,983
Here we are,
protected--

689
01:25:31,094 --> 01:25:33,153
free to make our profiits
without Kefauver...

690
01:25:33,263 --> 01:25:36,960
the goddamn Justice
Department and the FBl--

691
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:40,593
90 miles away, partnership
with a friendly government.

692
01:25:42,038 --> 01:25:46,236
Ninety miles. It's nothing.

693
01:25:46,342 --> 01:25:48,902
Just one small step,
looking for a man...

694
01:25:49,012 --> 01:25:52,175
that wants to be President
of the United States...

695
01:25:52,282 --> 01:25:55,649
and having the cash to make it possible.

696
01:25:55,752 --> 01:25:57,652
Michael...

697
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:02,122
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

698
01:26:28,284 --> 01:26:30,684
Mikey, how are ya? Okay?

699
01:26:32,722 --> 01:26:35,452
Hiya. Freddie Corleone.

700
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:40,925
Jesus Christ, what a trip.

701
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,463
The whole time I'm thinkin'...

702
01:26:42,565 --> 01:26:44,658
"What if somebody knows
what I got in here?"

703
01:26:44,767 --> 01:26:49,101
Imagine that. Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

704
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:51,105
All right.

705
01:26:52,675 --> 01:26:55,075
- Whoops. Excuse me.
- No, it's okay.

706
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,280
You wanna count it?

707
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:07,178
Mikey, what the hell's goin' on anyway?

708
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,520
The family's making an
investment in Havana.

709
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:12,958
- This is a gift for the president.
- Oh.

710
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:15,030
Well, that's great.

711
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:17,031
Havana's great.

712
01:27:18,134 --> 01:27:20,034
It's my kind of town.

713
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:23,664
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- I don't know.

714
01:27:23,773 --> 01:27:25,741
Hyman Roth? Johnny Ola?

715
01:27:29,212 --> 01:27:31,737
No. I never met them.

716
01:27:35,518 --> 01:27:37,816
Listen, Mikey...

717
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,820
I'm kind
of, uh--

718
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:44,758
kind of nervous from the trip.

719
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:48,490
Uh, can l-- can I get a,
uh, drink or somethin'?

720
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:51,863
I thought maybe we'd--
we'd go out together.

721
01:27:51,968 --> 01:27:54,869
I know a place we can spend
some time together. Okay?

722
01:27:57,373 --> 01:28:00,536
Sometimes I think I should've
married a woman like you did...

723
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:03,043
Like Kay.

724
01:28:03,146 --> 01:28:05,546
Have kids, have a family.

725
01:28:08,217 --> 01:28:11,618
For once in my life be more like...

726
01:28:13,022 --> 01:28:14,614
Pop.

727
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:21,626
It's not easy to be a
son, Fredo. It's not easy.

728
01:28:21,731 --> 01:28:24,859
Mama used to tease me. She'd
say, "You don't belong to me.

729
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:28,494
You were left on the
doorstep by gypsies."

730
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:31,471
Sometimes I think it's true.

731
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:33,474
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

732
01:28:35,111 --> 01:28:37,102
Mikey,
I--

733
01:28:37,213 --> 01:28:39,113
I was mad at you.

734
01:28:46,355 --> 01:28:50,291
Why didn't we spend
time like this before?

735
01:28:50,393 --> 01:28:52,793
You want a drink, right? Waiter.

736
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:03,470
- How do you say banana daiquiri?
- Banana daiquiri.

737
01:29:03,573 --> 01:29:05,837
- That's it?
- That's it.

738
01:29:05,942 --> 01:29:08,843
- Uh, uno banana daiquiri.
- Banana daiquiri. Si, senor.

739
01:29:08,945 --> 01:29:11,345
And, uh, a club soda.

740
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:21,986
Senator Geary's flying in from
Washington tomorrow night...

741
01:29:22,091 --> 01:29:24,491
with some people, some
government people...

742
01:29:24,594 --> 01:29:27,757
and I want you to show
'em a good time in Havana.

743
01:29:30,099 --> 01:29:32,533
It's my specialty, right?

744
01:29:32,635 --> 01:29:35,798
- Can I trust you with something?
- Ofcourse, Mike.

745
01:29:39,575 --> 01:29:42,942
In the evening, we're all invited
to the presidential palace...

746
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,605
a reception to bring in the new year.

747
01:29:45,715 --> 01:29:47,615
After it's over...

748
01:29:47,717 --> 01:29:50,242
they're gonna take me
home in a military car...

749
01:29:50,353 --> 01:29:54,050
alone, for my protection...

750
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:57,557
and before I reach my
hotel I'll be assassinated.

751
01:30:15,912 --> 01:30:18,972
- Who?
- Roth.

752
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:27,688
It was Roth who tried
to kill me in my home.

753
01:30:29,492 --> 01:30:31,551
It was Roth all along.

754
01:30:31,661 --> 01:30:36,894
He acts like I'm his
son, his successor...

755
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:39,934
but he thinks he's gonna live
forever and he wants me out.

756
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:46,133
How can I help?

757
01:30:46,242 --> 01:30:49,609
You just go along as
though you know nothing.

758
01:30:49,712 --> 01:30:53,648
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

759
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:56,240
Hyman Roth'll never see the new year.

760
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:16,163
He says you have to take it easy
and he'll give you a prescription.

761
01:31:16,272 --> 01:31:17,534
He'll be back tomorrow.

762
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,074
I want my own doctor.
Fly him in from Miami.

763
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:22,371
I don't trust a doctor
can't speak English.

764
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:30,651
Honey, go down to the casino.

765
01:31:30,753 --> 01:31:34,154
- If you're sure you're better.
- Feel fine.

766
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:38,889
- Play the bingo game.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

767
01:31:38,995 --> 01:31:40,963
-Just make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

768
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:44,231
My sixth sense tells me...

769
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:46,858
your brother Fredo brought
a bag full of money.

770
01:31:46,969 --> 01:31:50,132
Where is it?

771
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,673
You're pulling out?

772
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:56,677
Just wanna-- I
just wanna wait.

773
01:32:00,049 --> 01:32:02,643
How do you feel?

774
01:32:02,752 --> 01:32:04,947
Terrible. I'd give four million...

775
01:32:05,054 --> 01:32:08,285
just to be able to take
a piss without it hurting.

776
01:32:08,391 --> 01:32:11,690
Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?

777
01:32:11,794 --> 01:32:14,160
The Rosato brothers.

778
01:32:14,263 --> 01:32:17,824
I know. But who gave the go-ahead?

779
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:20,834
I know I didn't.

780
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:30,569
There was this kid I grew up with.

781
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,841
He was younger than me.

782
01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:35,439
Sort of looked up to me, you know.

783
01:32:35,551 --> 01:32:39,112
We did our first work together.

784
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,280
Worked our way out of the street.

785
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,381
Things were good. We
made the most of it.

786
01:32:44,727 --> 01:32:47,218
During Prohibition...

787
01:32:47,329 --> 01:32:49,297
we ran molasses into Canada.

788
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:51,866
Made a fortune. Your father too.

789
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:57,429
As much as anyone...

790
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:00,065
I loved him and trusted him.

791
01:33:03,112 --> 01:33:06,570
Later on he had an idea...

792
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:08,843
to build a city...

793
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:12,648
out of a desert stopover for G.I.s
on their way to the West Coast.

794
01:33:14,724 --> 01:33:18,421
That kid's name was Moe Green...

795
01:33:18,527 --> 01:33:21,758
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

796
01:33:23,499 --> 01:33:25,933
This was a great man...

797
01:33:26,035 --> 01:33:28,526
a man of vision and guts...

798
01:33:28,637 --> 01:33:33,802
and there isn't even a plaque or
a signpost or a statue of him...

799
01:33:33,909 --> 01:33:36,810
in that town.

800
01:33:36,912 --> 01:33:40,370
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

801
01:33:41,751 --> 01:33:44,982
No one knows who gave the order.

802
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:48,215
When I heard it I wasn't angry.

803
01:33:48,324 --> 01:33:50,349
I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong.

804
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:54,361
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

805
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:57,694
So when he turned up dead...

806
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:00,997
I let it go...

807
01:34:01,103 --> 01:34:04,334
and I said to myself...

808
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:08,342
"This is the business we've chosen."

809
01:34:08,444 --> 01:34:11,242
I didn't ask...

810
01:34:11,347 --> 01:34:13,247
who gave the order...

811
01:34:13,349 --> 01:34:16,284
because it had nothing
to do with business.

812
01:34:24,927 --> 01:34:28,829
That two million in
a bag in your room--

813
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:33,667
I'm going in...

814
01:34:33,769 --> 01:34:35,828
to take a nap.

815
01:34:35,938 --> 01:34:38,031
When I wake...

816
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:41,803
if the money's on the table
I'll know I have a partner.

817
01:34:41,911 --> 01:34:44,311
If it isn't, I'll know I don't.

818
01:35:40,002 --> 01:35:42,129
All right, does everybody
know everybody here, huh?

819
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:44,206
- This is Senator Geary.
- How are you, Senator?

820
01:35:44,306 --> 01:35:47,537
Good to see you, Mike. I'm glad
we could spend time together.

821
01:35:47,643 --> 01:35:50,703
- Senator Payton from Florida.
- How you doing, Mike?

822
01:35:50,813 --> 01:35:53,247
- And Judge DeMalco from New York.
- How do you do, sir?

823
01:35:53,349 --> 01:35:55,510
- Fine, thank you.
- Senator Ream from Maryland.

824
01:35:55,618 --> 01:35:58,917
- I've been looking forward to this.
- This is Fred Corngold from U.T.T.

825
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:02,513
- I know Fred. How are you? -
Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha.

826
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:06,083
- Oh, he does, huh?
- Gentlemen, it's refiill time.

827
01:36:06,195 --> 01:36:10,723
Try some of them local drinks--
uh, cuba libre, pina colada.

828
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:14,701
I think I'll try one of
those redheaded Yolandas.

829
01:36:14,803 --> 01:36:18,739
- That you got. Congusto.
- Johnny.

830
01:36:18,841 --> 01:36:22,470
You don't know my brother Fredo,
do you, Johnny? Johnny Ola, Fredo.

831
01:36:22,578 --> 01:36:24,739
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

832
01:36:27,416 --> 01:36:29,714
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana.

833
01:36:29,818 --> 01:36:31,718
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

834
01:36:33,055 --> 01:36:35,683
- Happy New Year.
- That's right, huh?

835
01:36:39,862 --> 01:36:43,195
- Checkin' in now. Right now.
- Never fear! Pat Geary's here!

836
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:46,132
- Hey, Fred.
- Cheers! Hey!

837
01:36:46,235 --> 01:36:48,726
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standin'?
- Come on, man!

838
01:36:48,837 --> 01:36:51,601
Everybody stands, but it's worth it.

839
01:36:51,707 --> 01:36:54,505
- You're not gonna believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

840
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:58,137
- That's right. Fifty dollars.
- You got a bet, mister.

841
01:37:06,588 --> 01:37:09,056
That's him. That's Superman.

842
01:37:41,724 --> 01:37:44,318
- Jesus Christ!
- Did I tell ya, or did I tell ya?

843
01:37:46,095 --> 01:37:48,655
- I don't believe it.
- That thing's gotta be a fake.

844
01:37:48,764 --> 01:37:52,666
That ain't no fake. That's real.
That's why they call him Superman.

845
01:37:52,768 --> 01:37:56,761
Hey, Freddie. Freddie. Where
did you find this place?

846
01:37:56,872 --> 01:37:59,238
Johnny Ola told me about this
place. He brought me here.

847
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:01,241
I didn't believe it, but
seein' is believin', huh?

848
01:38:01,343 --> 01:38:04,801
- I see it and I don't believe it.
- Fifty bucks, Pat.

849
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:06,471
Old man Roth'd never come here...

850
01:38:06,582 --> 01:38:09,449
but ol'Johnny knows these
places like the back of his hand.

851
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:12,145
Now watch him. He's gonna
break the cracker with it.

852
01:38:12,254 --> 01:38:15,519
I wanna see him break a brick.

853
01:38:15,624 --> 01:38:18,024
He could knock down a building.

854
01:39:36,438 --> 01:39:39,635
Relax, Senor Roth. We're
taking you to the hospital.

855
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,109
