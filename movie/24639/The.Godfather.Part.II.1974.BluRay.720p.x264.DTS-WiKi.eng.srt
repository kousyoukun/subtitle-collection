1
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:47,110
The nurse.

2
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:14,867
- Do you have any money?
- No.

3
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:17,715
lnterpreter.

4
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:27,286
Where are you from?

5
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,350
- What is your name?
- Maria.

6
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,926
What is your name?

7
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:39,567
Come on, son.
What is your name?

8
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:45,904
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

9
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,410
Vito Corleone.

10
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:53,975
Okay. Over there.

11
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:57,181
Next. Your name.

12
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:07,928
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine, three months.

13
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,570
Vito Corleone?

14
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:26,973
Here he is.
This is him.

15
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:16,120
Did you bring the car keys?

16
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:51,225
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

17
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,492
- This is Father Carmelo.
- l'm Merle Johnson.

18
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,194
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Excuse me.

19
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:03,332
- Here l am.
- After one week?

20
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:06,935
l sent the car out to the airport
last week to pick you up.

21
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:08,445
lt was chaos.

22
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:11,540
Anyway, here l am,
just one week late.

23
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,209
And this is for my mama.

24
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,844
- What is this?
- You remember Merle, don't you?

25
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,650
- Hello, Mama.
- Yeah, hello.

26
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,645
How are you?
Thank you.

27
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,386
Where's Michael?
l gotta talk to him...

28
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:24,793
and get a few things straight,
and l can't wait on line.

29
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,822
You go see your children first...

30
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:31,426
and then you worry about waiting
on line to see your brother...

31
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:33,836
like everybody else.

32
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:41,508
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Frankie, wake up.

33
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:44,845
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

34
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:49,342
Would you please welcome Senator
Pat Geary of the state of Nevada.

35
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,344
And there's Mrs. Geary.

36
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,400
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

37
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:08,326
And this is a very,
very happy day for me...

38
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,932
and my wife, Mrs. Geary.

39
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:15,273
We see Nevada far too seldom...

40
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:17,474
but particularly today...

41
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:20,280
when we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends...

42
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:24,049
and we help celebrate
a young man's first communion...

43
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:28,017
and also to thank
that boy's family...

44
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:31,221
for a magnificent contribution
to the state.

45
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:35,431
l have here in my hand a check...

46
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:37,765
made out to the university...

47
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,635
and it is
a magnificent endowment...

48
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,628
in the name of...

49
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:46,940
Anthony Vito Corleone.

50
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:51,311
And the check is signed
by that young man's parents...

51
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,011
whom l think
we should recognize now.

52
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,610
Mike, Pat, Kay--

53
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:58,611
Stand up, please.
Let the folks see you.

54
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,784
Folks, l want you to join with me...

55
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,749
in giving a real
Nevada thank-you...

56
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,593
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

57
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,665
We also have,
as a special added attraction...

58
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:17,868
the Sierra Boys Choir...

59
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:20,468
who have chosen...

60
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:24,369
a certain special song
and a special arrangement...

61
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:28,375
to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.

62
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:30,581
Boys.

63
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:41,754
- Why this feeling
- Why this feeling

64
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:46,259
- Why this glow
-Just why this glow

65
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:48,761
The plaque.

66
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,763
Okay, fellas, l got that one.

67
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,375
Okay, this is yours.

68
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:57,369
Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone.

69
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:21,235
- Excuse me.
- This is my lawyer Tom Hagen.

70
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,229
- Senator Geary.
- Mr. Hagen.

71
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:26,403
He's the one who arranged this whole
thing through your man Turnbull.

72
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,742
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

73
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:36,175
l was under the impression
that you and l would talk alone.

74
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,818
l trust these men
with my life, Senator.

75
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:43,020
lf l were to ask them to leave,
it would be an insult.

76
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:48,564
lt's all right with me, but l should
tell you l am a blunt man...

77
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:51,501
and l intend to speak
very frankly to you...

78
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:57,133
more frankly than anyone in my
position's talked to you before.

79
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,905
The Corleone family has done
very well here in Nevada.

80
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:05,371
You own, or you control,
two major hotels in Vegas...

81
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,851
one in Reno.

82
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:10,081
The licenses
were grandfathered in...

83
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,386
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission.

84
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:18,552
But now my sources tell me that...

85
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:22,192
you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

86
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:24,667
They tell me that within a week...

87
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,262
you're gonna move Klingman out.

88
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,534
That's quite an expansion.

89
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:33,305
However, it will leave you
with one little technical problem.

90
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:38,805
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

91
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,819
Turnbull is a good man.

92
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:44,879
Yeah, well, let's just--
let's cut out the bullshit.

93
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:48,154
l don't want to spend any more time
here than l have to.

94
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,752
You can have the license.

95
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,060
The price is $250,000...

96
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,124
plus a monthly payment
of five percent of the gross...

97
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,930
of all four hotels...

98
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:00,801
Mr. Corleone.

99
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:08,499
Now, the price for the license
is less than $20,000.

100
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,502
- Am l right?
- That's right.

101
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,349
Now, why would l ever consider
paying more than that?

102
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:17,651
Because l intend to squeeze you.

103
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:20,351
l don't like your kind of people.

104
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,655
l don't like to see you come out
to this clean country...

105
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:24,593
in your oily hair...

106
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:28,364
dressed up in those silk suits...

107
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:32,427
and you try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

108
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,427
l'll do business with you,
but the fact is that...

109
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,339
l despise your masquerade...

110
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:41,368
the dishonest way
you pose yourself--

111
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,676
yourself and your whole
fucking family.

112
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,254
Senator...

113
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,658
we're both part
of the same hypocrisy...

114
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:02,128
but never think it applies
to my family.

115
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:04,829
All right, all right.

116
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:09,399
Some people have to play
little games.

117
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:11,067
You play yours.

118
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,409
Let's just say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest to.

119
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:21,445
But l want your answer
and the money by noon tomorrow.

120
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:25,820
And one more thing:
Don't you contact me again, ever.

121
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:29,884
From now on, you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

122
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:34,355
Senator, you can have
my answer now if you like.

123
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:40,234
My offer is this:

124
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:41,738
nothing.

125
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,364
Not even the fee
for the gaming license...

126
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:49,005
which l would appreciate
if you would put up personally.

127
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:56,145
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

128
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:02,152
Ladies. l didn't know
you were out here.

129
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:05,389
- We have to go. We're late.
- Really? l'm sorry.

130
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:08,092
lt's been a delightful party.
Thank you for inviting us.

131
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:11,557
lt's been our pleasure.
lt was wonderful talking to you.

132
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:59,543
Fredo, you son of a bitch!

133
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,415
You look great!

134
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,385
Frank Pentangeli!

135
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:06,219
l thought you was never
coming out west, you big bum.

136
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,952
l gotta check on my boys, huh?

137
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,755
- What's with the food around here?
- What's the matter?

138
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,493
Kid comes up to me
in a white jacket...

139
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:17,796
gives me a Ritz cracker
and a chopped liver...

140
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:19,633
he says ''canap¨¦s.''

141
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:22,799
l said, ''Can of peas my ass!

142
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:25,173
That's a Ritz cracker
and chopped liver.''

143
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:31,441
- Bring out the peppers and sausage.
- Hey, Freddie.

144
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,179
Seeing you reminds me of New York.
The old days, huh?

145
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:38,621
Hey, Fredo,
you remember Willi Cicci?

146
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:41,022
We was with old man Clemenza
in Brooklyn.

147
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:46,260
We were all upset about that.

148
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:47,696
Heart attack, huh?

149
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,688
No, there was no heart attack.

150
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:55,396
That's what l'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

151
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:58,432
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

152
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:00,500
l mean, what do l gotta do?
Do l have to get...

153
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:03,969
a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

154
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,573
You can't get in to see Mike?

155
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:08,415
He's got me waiting in a lobby!

156
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,388
-Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

157
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,457
Do you know my lawyer
Tom Hagen? Johnny Ola.

158
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:26,197
Sure. l remember Tom
from the old days.

159
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:29,229
Rocco, what's this?

160
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:32,072
lt's an orange from Miami.

161
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:34,976
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

162
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:40,371
- Good to see you.
- Tom isn't gonna sit in with us.

163
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:43,114
He only handles specific areas
of the family business.

164
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:45,110
- Tom?
- Sure, Mike.

165
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:52,394
What are you drinking,Johnny?

166
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:53,897
Anisette.

167
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:01,369
lf you need anything
l'll be outside, all right?

168
00:23:01,474 --> 00:23:03,362
Just tell Rocco we're waiting.

169
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:11,973
l just left Mr. Roth in Miami.

170
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:14,780
- How's his health?
- lt's not good.

171
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:19,451
ls there anything l can do,
anything l can send?

172
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,016
He appreciates your concern,
Michael, and your respect.

173
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,724
That casino you're interested in,
the registered owners are...

174
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:31,860
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay,
both Beverly Hills attorneys.

175
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:34,895
The real owners are the Lakeville
Road group from Cleveland...

176
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:37,430
and our friend in Miami.

177
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,101
Meyer Klingman runs the store.

178
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:41,873
He owns a piece of it too,
and he does all right.

179
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,779
But l've been instructed to tell you
that if you move Klingman out...

180
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:47,273
our friend in Miami will go along.

181
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:52,147
That's very kind of him.

182
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:54,488
You tell him
that's greatly appreciated.

183
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:58,854
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

184
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:05,198
One by one,
our old friends are gone.

185
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:08,637
Death, natural or not...

186
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:10,902
prison, deported.

187
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:15,211
Hyman Roth is the only one left...

188
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:18,545
because he always made money
for his partners.

189
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,983
My God!
l can't believe...

190
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,180
out of 30 professional musicians...

191
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:25,712
there isn't one ltalian
in the group here.

192
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,713
Come on.
Let's have a tarantella.

193
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,225
You, up! Come on!
Up, up, up!

194
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:12,262
l'll see my sister alone.

195
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:15,260
lt concerns me too.
ls it okay if l stay?

196
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:17,103
How are you, honey?

197
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:20,337
You've met Merle.
He was with me in Vegas.

198
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:23,279
- l saw him with you.
- Could l have a drink or something?

199
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,751
Al, would you please
get him a drink?

200
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:35,747
We're going to Europe. l'd like
to book passage on the Queen.

201
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:38,625
So what do you come to me for?
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

202
00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:40,562
We're getting married first.

203
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:53,236
The ink on your divorce isn't dry
yet, and you're getting married?

204
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:59,209
You see your children on weekends.

205
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:01,707
Your oldest boy
was picked up in Reno...

206
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,050
for some petty theft
you don't even know about.

207
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:07,284
You fly around the world with men
who use you like a whore.

208
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:10,089
- You're not my father!
- Then what do you come to me for?

209
00:26:10,196 --> 00:26:11,720
'Cause l need money.

210
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,441
l wanna be reasonable with you.

211
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:40,489
Now, why don't you stay here
with us, with the family?

212
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:44,857
You can live here on the estate
with your kids.

213
00:26:44,964 --> 00:26:48,456
You won't be deprived of anything.
You can have everything you want.

214
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:55,835
Now, l don't know this Merle.
l don't know what he does.

215
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:57,829
l don't know what he lives on.

216
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,466
Tell him marriage
is out of the question...

217
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,640
and you don't want
to see him anymore.

218
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,173
He'll understand.
Believe me.

219
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,930
lf you don't listen to me...

220
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:23,922
and marry this man...

221
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,301
you'll disappoint me.

222
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:08,976
What's cent'anni?

223
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:11,037
Cent'anni.
lt means a hundred years.

224
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:16,280
lt means we should all live happily
for a hundred years, the family.

225
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:18,219
lt'd be true
if my father were alive.

226
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:24,923
Merle, you've met
my sister-in-law Deanna.

227
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:27,623
- Fredo's wife.
- A pleasure, Merle.

228
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,621
- How do you do?
- My pleasure.

229
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,461
What did she mean by that?

230
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:17,807
What's the matter?
l just wanna dance.

231
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,009
Dancing is one thing.
You're falling all over the floor.

232
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:23,816
l know what's the matter. You're
jealous 'cause he's a real man.

233
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:26,982
l swear to God, l'm gonna
belt you right in the teeth.

234
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,684
You couldn't belt your mama.

235
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,751
You know something? These dagos are
crazy when it comes to their wives.

236
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:35,789
Michael says that if
you can't take care of this...

237
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,233
l have to.

238
00:29:38,337 --> 00:29:41,135
- l think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop!

239
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,129
They treat their wives like shit!
l didn't mean to say Wop!

240
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,167
Stop that!

241
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,372
What are you doing to me?

242
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,870
You big slob! Help!

243
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,109
l can't control her, Mikey.

244
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,712
You're my brother, Fredo.
You don't have to apologize to me.

245
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,449
Clemenza promised
the Rosato brothers...

246
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:06,554
three territories in the Bronx
after he died.

247
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,621
You took over,
and you didn't give it to them.

248
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:09,894
- l welched?
- You welched.

249
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:12,960
Clemenza promised them ''ugatz. ''

250
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:14,834
Clemenza promised them nothing.

251
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,170
He hated those son of a bitches
more than l do.

252
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:20,404
Frankie, they feel cheated.

253
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:24,073
You're sitting high up
in the Sierra Mountains...

254
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:25,582
and you're drinking--

255
00:30:25,684 --> 00:30:27,413
- What's he drinking, Cicci?
- Champagne.

256
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,510
Champagne cocktails.

257
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,680
And you're passing judgment
on how l run my family.

258
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,078
You're a good old man.

259
00:30:58,183 --> 00:30:59,775
l like you.

260
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:02,678
And you were loyal
to my father for years.

261
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:08,217
The Rosato brothers,
they're taking hostages.

262
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:13,127
And Mike,
they spit right in my face...

263
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:15,621
all because they're backed up
by that Jew in Miami.

264
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:18,726
l know. That's why
l don't want 'em touched.

265
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:19,895
- You don't want 'em touched.
- No.

266
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,565
l want you to be fair with them.

267
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,630
You want me to be fair with 'em?

268
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,839
How can you be fair to animals?

269
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:30,335
Tom, for Christ's sakes, listen.

270
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:33,976
They recruit spics.
They recruit niggers.

271
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:38,079
And they do violence in
their grandmothers' neighborhoods.

272
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,818
And l tell ya,
everything with them is whores.

273
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:44,384
Whores and junk. Dope.

274
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:47,158
And they leave the gambling to last.

275
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:50,326
Now, l wanna run my family
without you on my back...

276
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:53,461
and l want those
Rosato brothers dead.

277
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:04,243
Now, l have business that's
important with Hyman Roth.

278
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,611
l don't want it disturbed.

279
00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:09,845
Then you'll give your loyalty
to a Jew before your own blood?

280
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:17,320
Come on. You know my father
did business with Hyman Roth.

281
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:18,919
He respected him.

282
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:21,761
Your father did business
with Hyman Roth...

283
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,256
your father respected Hyman Roth...

284
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,792
but your father
never trusted Hyman Roth...

285
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:30,693
or his Sicilian messenger boy
Johnny Ola.

286
00:32:38,617 --> 00:32:40,983
And l want everybody here to know...

287
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:44,112
there's not gonna be
no trouble from me.

288
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,144
Don Corleone.

289
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:58,423
You want him to leave now?

290
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:04,529
Let him go back to New York.
l've already made my plans.

291
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,500
The old man had too much wine.

292
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,846
lt's late.

293
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,692
How's the baby?

294
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,634
Sleeping inside me.

295
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:36,526
- Does it feel like a boy?
- Yes, it does, Michael.

296
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,138
l'm sorry about
all the people today.

297
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:45,910
Bad timing.

298
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:48,407
lt couldn't be helped, though.

299
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,148
lt made me think
of what you once told me.

300
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:57,955
ln five years, the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate.

301
00:33:58,063 --> 00:33:59,951
That was seven years ago.

302
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:05,597
l know.

303
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,262
l'm trying, darling.

304
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,202
Did you see this?

305
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:30,018
Michael, why are the drapes open?

306
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:59,046
- Kay, you all right?
- Yeah.

307
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:01,676
- Are you hit?
- No.

308
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,920
lt's over. lt's over.

309
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:10,382
Now! Shut it off!

310
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:13,724
Hold it!

311
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:28,297
They're still on the property.
Please, stay inside.

312
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:29,937
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

313
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:31,208
Rocco! Alive!

314
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,206
Stay by the door.

315
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:41,785
Check by the boathouse!

316
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,391
Yeah, come in.

317
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,638
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

318
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,143
Yeah?

319
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:12,981
There's a lot
l can't tell you, Tom.

320
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,715
Now, l know that's
upset you in the past.

321
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:23,355
You felt it was because of some
lack of trust or confidence...

322
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:30,265
but it's because
l admire you and l love you...

323
00:38:30,368 --> 00:38:32,290
that l kept things
secret from you.

324
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:37,531
That's why at this moment you're
the only one l can completely trust.

325
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:42,202
Fredo?

326
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,204
Well, he's got a good heart...

327
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:47,342
but he's weak and he's stupid...

328
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,340
and this is life and death.

329
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:53,912
Tom, you're my brother.

330
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:02,857
l always wanted to be thought of
as a brother by you.

331
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,492
A real brother.

332
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,890
l know that.

333
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:18,067
You're gonna take over.

334
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:20,543
You're gonna be the don.

335
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:27,013
lf what l think has happened
has happened...

336
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,882
l'm gonna leave here tonight.

337
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:33,649
l give you complete power
over Fredo and his men--

338
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:35,852
Rocco, Neri, everyone.

339
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:43,219
l'm trusting you with the lives
of my wife and my children--

340
00:39:43,335 --> 00:39:44,893
the future of this family.

341
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:49,435
When we catch these guys...

342
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,338
do you think we'll be able to
find out who's back of all this?

343
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:53,638
We're not gonna catch 'em.

344
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,446
Unless l'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

345
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:03,216
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

346
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:04,880
lnside.

347
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,618
Very, very frightened
they botched it.

348
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:10,024
Yeah, but your people,
Rocco and Neri...

349
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:12,289
you don't think that they had
something to do with this?

350
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:20,228
See, all our people
are businessmen.

351
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,630
Their loyalty's based on that.

352
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:29,267
One thing l learned from Pop...

353
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,513
was to try to think
as people around you think.

354
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:39,981
Now, on that basis,
anything's possible.

355
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:45,615
l seen them!
Right out my window!

356
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:48,427
l wanna get out of here!
They're lying there dead!

357
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,830
Get her inside!

358
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:03,003
Over here.
There's two of'em.

359
00:41:03,115 --> 00:41:04,912
Looks like they were
hired out of New York.

360
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:07,281
l don't recognize 'em.

361
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:10,617
We won't get anything
out of them now.

362
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:12,280
Fish 'em out.

363
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:39,703
All right, get rid of the bodies.

364
00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:41,809
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

365
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:16,480
Anthony, everything's
gonna be all right.

366
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:18,146
Try to sleep.

367
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:37,104
Did you like your party?

368
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:38,767
l got lots of presents.

369
00:42:38,877 --> 00:42:42,643
l know.
Did you like 'em?

370
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:45,410
l didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

371
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:48,740
Well, they're my friends.

372
00:42:50,922 --> 00:42:53,015
Did you see my present for you?

373
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,990
lt was on my pillow.

374
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:00,662
Anthony, l'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

375
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:03,958
Will you take me?

376
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:07,402
- No, l can't, Anthony.
- Why do you have to go?

377
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:11,630
'Cause l have to do business.

378
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,631
l could help you.

379
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:19,738
Well, someday you will.

380
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:23,445
Get some sleep.

381
00:43:32,898 --> 00:43:33,922
Good night.

382
00:47:58,263 --> 00:47:59,821
Vito. Come on.

383
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:04,021
We'll go see her backstage.

384
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:14,602
Come here.

385
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,414
Vito. Come here. Come on.

386
00:49:04,062 --> 00:49:05,620
Come here.

387
00:50:43,394 --> 00:50:44,952
You speak ltalian?

388
00:56:00,344 --> 00:56:02,107
Yeah, sure.

389
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:10,067
Come on in.

390
01:02:11,949 --> 01:02:14,838
lt's all right. Come on.
Hyman's in there.

391
01:02:14,952 --> 01:02:17,910
l was just making some lunch.
Would you like a tuna sandwich?

392
01:02:18,022 --> 01:02:19,910
Uh, no, thank you.

393
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:28,361
Pickup of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...

394
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:30,797
and the ball is at
the Trojan 38-yard line.

395
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:32,129
Mr. Roth?

396
01:02:32,236 --> 01:02:34,124
Come in, Michael.

397
01:02:36,674 --> 01:02:39,063
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

398
01:02:41,045 --> 01:02:43,036
lt's almost over.

399
01:02:45,482 --> 01:02:47,006
You follow the football game?

400
01:02:47,117 --> 01:02:50,473
- Pickup of five.
- Not for a while l haven't.

401
01:02:50,588 --> 01:02:53,421
l enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

402
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:56,448
One of the things l love
about this country.

403
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,653
Baseball too.

404
01:02:58,762 --> 01:03:00,627
l've loved baseball...

405
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:04,758
ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1 91 9.

406
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:08,258
...4 7. Marked down there,
say the officials.

407
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,966
And at that point
it'll be first and ten--

408
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:12,633
l heard you had some trouble.

409
01:03:12,743 --> 01:03:15,667
It'll be third and ten, another
of those big plays now...

410
01:03:15,779 --> 01:03:18,441
- Stupid.
- coming up for S.C.

411
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:20,813
People behaving like that
with guns.

412
01:03:20,918 --> 01:03:23,478
...but it looks like
it could stall here.

413
01:03:23,587 --> 01:03:26,351
The important thing is,
you're all right.

414
01:03:26,457 --> 01:03:30,416
Good health.
The most important thing.

415
01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:33,052
More than success.
More than money.

416
01:03:33,163 --> 01:03:35,927
- Now he's back to pass.
- More than power.

417
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:38,126
Rolls upfield for Hayes.
He's intercepted.

418
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:43,901
Hurd has it to the Irish 40.
To the far sideline. Gets by the 45.

419
01:03:44,008 --> 01:03:48,365
He's hit and dropped
at the S.C. 4 2-yard line.

420
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,107
Notre Dame's first big break
of the game.

421
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:55,003
l came here because there's
gonna be more bloodshed.

422
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,451
l want you to know about it
before it happens...

423
01:03:57,554 --> 01:04:00,045
so that there's no danger
of starting another war.

424
01:04:00,124 --> 01:04:03,150
Nobody wants another war.

425
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,923
Frank Pentangeli came to my home
and he asked my permission...

426
01:04:07,031 --> 01:04:08,555
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

427
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:10,998
When l refused,
he tried to have me killed.

428
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:14,593
He was stupid. l was lucky.
l'll visit him soon.

429
01:04:14,705 --> 01:04:18,004
The important thing is that
nothing interfere...

430
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:19,996
with our plans for the future.

431
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:23,807
- Yours and mine.
- Nothing is more important.

432
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:25,404
Good.

433
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:28,405
You're a wise
and considerate young man.

434
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:31,374
And you're a great man,
Mr. Roth.

435
01:04:31,488 --> 01:04:35,515
- There's much l can learn from you.
- What can l do to help, Michael?

436
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:38,459
To the 3 2, and is downed there
by Danny Zika.

437
01:04:38,562 --> 01:04:41,053
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Oh.

438
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:43,053
- Okay.
- Ohh!

439
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:46,056
Hyman, you're gonna
break my eardrums.

440
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:49,363
- Okay, enjoy it.
- Thanks.

441
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:59,312
You're young.
l'm old and sick.

442
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:02,214
What we'll do together
in the next few months...

443
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,446
will make history, Michael.

444
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:07,444
History.
lt's never been done before.

445
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:11,881
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

446
01:05:14,064 --> 01:05:16,897
And Pentangeli is a dead man.

447
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,060
- You don't object?
- Pickup of four.

448
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,058
He's small potatoes.

449
01:05:32,783 --> 01:05:35,343
What's up?

450
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:39,409
We got company, huh?

451
01:06:19,329 --> 01:06:22,457
Don Corleone, l wish you would've
let me know you were comin'.

452
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:25,057
l could've prepared
something for you.

453
01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:28,058
l didn't want you to know
l was coming.

454
01:06:34,445 --> 01:06:36,106
You heard what happened
in my home?

455
01:06:36,213 --> 01:06:40,138
- Mike, l almost died myself.
- ln my home!

456
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,509
ln my bedroom
where my wife sleeps!

457
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:53,248
Where my children come
and play with their toys.

458
01:06:53,363 --> 01:06:55,251
ln my home.

459
01:07:12,382 --> 01:07:15,442
l want you to help me
take my revenge.

460
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:17,577
Michael, anything.

461
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:19,576
What can l do?

462
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:25,625
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

463
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:28,357
Mike, l don't understand.
l don't--

464
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:31,195
l don't have your brain
for big deals...

465
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:33,030
but this is a street thing.

466
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:36,264
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
That--

467
01:07:36,373 --> 01:07:38,500
He's backin' up
those son-of-a-bitches.

468
01:07:38,609 --> 01:07:39,541
l know.

469
01:07:39,643 --> 01:07:42,976
Then why? Why do you ask me
to lay down to him, Mike?

470
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:52,442
lt was Hyman Roth that
tried to have me killed.

471
01:07:54,258 --> 01:07:57,386
l know it was him.

472
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,860
Jesus Christ, Mike.

473
01:07:59,963 --> 01:08:01,851
Jesus Christ, look,
let's get 'em all.

474
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:05,264
Let's hit 'em all now,
while we got the muscle.

475
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,329
This used to be
my father's old study.

476
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:15,832
lt's changed.

477
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:19,670
l remember
there used to be a--

478
01:08:19,783 --> 01:08:21,671
A big desk was here.

479
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:26,576
l remember when l was a kid,
Frankie...

480
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,079
we had to be very quiet
when we played near here.

481
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:40,691
l was very happy that this
house never went to strangers.

482
01:08:42,406 --> 01:08:45,569
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.

483
01:08:48,145 --> 01:08:50,841
My father taught me
many things here.

484
01:08:50,948 --> 01:08:53,337
He taught me in this room.

485
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:00,215
He taught me,
keep your friends close...

486
01:09:00,324 --> 01:09:02,622
but your enemies closer.

487
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:06,116
Now, if Hyman Roth sees that
l interceded in this thing...

488
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:09,084
in the Rosato brothers' favor...

489
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,997
he's gonna think his relationship
with me is still good.

490
01:09:15,472 --> 01:09:18,566
That's what l want him to think.

491
01:09:18,675 --> 01:09:23,374
l want him completely relaxed
and confident in our friendship.

492
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,371
Then l'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

493
01:09:55,012 --> 01:09:59,142
- Yeah?
- Fredo. This is Johnny.

494
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:01,638
Johnny Ola.
We need some more help.

495
01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:03,913
Johnny?

496
01:10:04,021 --> 01:10:06,910
Jesus Christ,
what the hell time is it?

497
01:10:07,024 --> 01:10:09,982
- Who is that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

498
01:10:10,093 --> 01:10:13,119
What are you callin' me here for?
l don't want to talk to you.

499
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:15,460
Pentangeli's set up a meeting
with the Rosato brothers.

500
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:17,897
- He's gonna go for their deal.
- Oh, God.

501
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:20,526
- Will he come alone?
- l don't know anything.

502
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:23,197
- You got me in deep enough already.
-Just go along.

503
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:25,297
Everything will be all right,
Fredo.

504
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:27,707
Pentangeli says he's
willing to make a deal.

505
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:30,700
All we wanna know is
if he's on the level.

506
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:35,341
You guys lied to me. l don't
want you to call me anymore.

507
01:10:35,452 --> 01:10:37,943
Your brother's not gonna
find out we talked.

508
01:10:38,021 --> 01:10:40,910
l don't know
what you're talkin' about.

509
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:52,789
Who was that?

510
01:10:52,903 --> 01:10:54,791
Uh, wrong number.

511
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:04,901
Frank, l got nobody here.

512
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,903
- Wait in the car, Cheech.
- Frankie--

513
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:08,905
lt's okay, Cheech.

514
01:11:16,059 --> 01:11:19,449
- What's this, Rosato?
- A lucky ''C'' note for our new deal.

515
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:25,288
Richie.
Give us a taste, huh?

516
01:11:29,973 --> 01:11:33,932
Yeah, we're all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

517
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:38,469
- You're not gonna regret it.
- l don't like this ''C'' note.

518
01:11:38,582 --> 01:11:41,073
l take that as an insult.

519
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:43,381
Michael Corleone says hello.

520
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:03,564
Get him in!
Close the fuckin' door!

521
01:12:03,673 --> 01:12:06,062
Your friend the cop.
What the--

522
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:08,906
Hey, Rich, it's dark in here.

523
01:12:09,012 --> 01:12:13,403
- Are you open or closed?
- l just come in to clean up.

524
01:12:16,787 --> 01:12:19,119
What's the matter?

525
01:12:19,222 --> 01:12:22,180
- ls that somethin' on the floor?
- Carmine, no, no. Not here!

526
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:24,783
- Not here!
- Not here, Carmine! Not a cop!

527
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:26,749
What?

528
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:30,321
You open your fuckin' mouth,
l'll blow your head off!

529
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:18,201
Freddie. Good to see ya.

530
01:13:21,117 --> 01:13:23,005
Where is he?

531
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:25,781
He's okay. He's in the back.

532
01:13:29,793 --> 01:13:32,182
Come on, girls.
Take a hike, huh?

533
01:13:35,298 --> 01:13:37,186
ln this room here.

534
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,130
- l wanna talk to him alone first.
- Come on, huh?

535
01:13:52,315 --> 01:13:55,239
l thought l could
help you, Senator.

536
01:13:59,122 --> 01:14:01,386
Hagen?

537
01:14:02,225 --> 01:14:05,285
- Listen, Hagen, l did not--
- No.

538
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:07,454
- lt's all right.
- l didn't do anything.

539
01:14:07,564 --> 01:14:09,691
lt's okay.

540
01:14:09,799 --> 01:14:12,063
You're very lucky.

541
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:14,659
My brother Fredo
operates this place.

542
01:14:14,738 --> 01:14:17,536
He was called before anyone.

543
01:14:17,641 --> 01:14:19,370
Now, if this had happened
someplace else...

544
01:14:19,476 --> 01:14:20,534
we couldn't
have helped you.

545
01:14:24,614 --> 01:14:29,039
When l woke up
l was on the floor...

546
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:31,040
and l don't know
how it happened.

547
01:14:31,154 --> 01:14:33,042
You can't remember?

548
01:14:36,793 --> 01:14:38,818
l passed out.

549
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:46,622
l'll fix it.

550
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:48,692
Okay.

551
01:14:54,878 --> 01:14:57,073
lt was just a game.

552
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,579
Jesus.

553
01:15:01,351 --> 01:15:03,239
Oh.

554
01:15:08,692 --> 01:15:10,853
Jesus!Jesus!

555
01:15:15,298 --> 01:15:18,028
Jesus God.

556
01:15:18,134 --> 01:15:20,056
Oh, God.

557
01:15:22,405 --> 01:15:26,102
l don't know and l don't
understand why l can't remember.

558
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:29,042
You don't have to remember.
Just do as l say.

559
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:31,739
They're putting a call in
to your office.

560
01:15:31,848 --> 01:15:35,773
Explain that you'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

561
01:15:35,885 --> 01:15:38,012
You decided to spend the night...

562
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:42,012
at Michael Corleone's house
in Tahoe as his guest.

563
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:45,615
l do remember
that she was laughing.

564
01:15:47,597 --> 01:15:49,485
We'd done it before...

565
01:15:49,599 --> 01:15:52,932
and l know that l could
not have hurt that girl.

566
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,958
This girl has no family.

567
01:15:56,072 --> 01:15:58,063
Nobody knows
that she worked here.

568
01:15:58,174 --> 01:16:00,665
lt'll be as though
she never existed.

569
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:05,735
All that's left
is our friendship.

570
01:16:21,464 --> 01:16:23,352
- Yes?
- l'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.

571
01:16:23,466 --> 01:16:27,425
- We're not to let you through.
- l'm just going to the market.

572
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:30,097
Well, if you'll just give us a list,
we'll pick up anything you want.

573
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:33,437
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. He's coming.

574
01:16:33,543 --> 01:16:36,671
All right, well, l'm just gonna
have to speak to Mr. Hagen.

575
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:45,613
l wanted to explain this, but
l had business in Carson City.

576
01:16:45,722 --> 01:16:47,747
Now, this is Michael's
request for your safety.

577
01:16:47,857 --> 01:16:50,451
- We can send out for anything.
- l see.

578
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,516
l'm supposed to stay
in my house.

579
01:16:52,629 --> 01:16:55,120
No, within the compound
would be fine.

580
01:16:55,231 --> 01:16:57,495
l was going to take the children
to New England next week.

581
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,831
- That's off now.
- Am l a prisoner? ls that it?

582
01:17:00,937 --> 01:17:03,428
- That's not the way we look at it.
- All right, come on, kids.

583
01:17:03,506 --> 01:17:05,394
We're going back to the house.

584
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:09,665
Joe.

585
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:57,187
Cuba! Cuba!

586
01:18:38,334 --> 01:18:41,258
Most respected gentlemen...

587
01:18:41,371 --> 01:18:43,532
allow me to welcome you
to the city of Havana.

588
01:18:45,675 --> 01:18:50,669
l want to thank this distinguished
group of American industrialists...

589
01:18:52,715 --> 01:18:54,603
for continuing to work
with Cuba...

590
01:18:56,386 --> 01:18:58,581
toward the greatest period
of prosperity...

591
01:19:00,223 --> 01:19:02,111
in her entire history.

592
01:19:03,626 --> 01:19:07,619
Mr. William Shaw, representing
the General Fruit Company;

593
01:19:09,532 --> 01:19:11,397
Misters Corngold and Dant...

594
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:14,299
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company;

595
01:19:16,573 --> 01:19:18,837
Mr. Petty,
regional vice president...

596
01:19:18,942 --> 01:19:21,331
of the Pan American
Mining Corporation;

597
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:26,242
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar,

598
01:19:28,585 --> 01:19:30,712
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada...

599
01:19:32,589 --> 01:19:35,888
representing our associates in
tourism and leisure activities;

600
01:19:37,427 --> 01:19:40,316
and my old friend and associate
from Florida...

601
01:19:42,465 --> 01:19:44,626
Mr. Hyman Roth.

602
01:19:44,734 --> 01:19:46,497
l would like to take this
opportunity...

603
01:19:46,603 --> 01:19:48,468
to thank United
Telephone and Telegraph...

604
01:19:48,571 --> 01:19:50,459
for their lovely Christmas gift:

605
01:19:55,111 --> 01:19:56,999
a solid gold telephone.

606
01:19:59,749 --> 01:20:02,638
Perhaps you gentlemen would
like to take a look at it.

607
01:20:04,153 --> 01:20:05,882
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

608
01:20:05,989 --> 01:20:09,049
Perhaps you would discuss
the status of rebel activity...

609
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:11,888
and what this can mean
to our businesses.

610
01:20:11,995 --> 01:20:13,485
- Of course.
- Very lovely.

611
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:16,054
l want to assure you
that although the rebels...

612
01:20:16,132 --> 01:20:19,329
have mounted an impressive
campaign in Las Villas...

613
01:20:25,936 --> 01:20:28,234
my staff indicates
with assurance...

614
01:20:28,338 --> 01:20:33,230
we'll drive them out of the city
of Santa Clara before the new year.

615
01:20:35,846 --> 01:20:38,406
And l want to put you all
at ease.

616
01:20:38,515 --> 01:20:42,406
We will tolerate no guerillas
in the casinos or swimming pools.

617
01:21:01,304 --> 01:21:03,192
He say that they are
making arrest...

618
01:21:03,306 --> 01:21:06,195
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

619
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:08,802
Johnny.

620
01:21:31,334 --> 01:21:34,462
Well, l hope my age
is correct.

621
01:21:34,571 --> 01:21:37,665
l'm always accurate
about my age.

622
01:21:37,774 --> 01:21:41,335
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

623
01:21:45,182 --> 01:21:47,878
l'm very pleased...

624
01:21:47,984 --> 01:21:50,873
you were all able to come
from such distances...

625
01:21:50,987 --> 01:21:52,181
to be with me today.

626
01:21:54,124 --> 01:21:56,820
When a man comes
to this point in his life...

627
01:21:58,361 --> 01:22:01,785
he wants to turn over the
things he's been blessed with--

628
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:03,889
turn them over to friends--

629
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,232
as a reward
for the friends he's had...

630
01:22:08,338 --> 01:22:13,571
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

631
01:22:13,677 --> 01:22:16,339
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear.

632
01:22:16,446 --> 01:22:20,268
The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

633
01:22:21,785 --> 01:22:26,813
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana...

634
01:22:26,923 --> 01:22:29,983
and there's no limit to
where we can go from here.

635
01:22:30,093 --> 01:22:34,848
This kind of government knows how
to help business, to encourage it.

636
01:22:34,965 --> 01:22:38,992
The hotels here
are bigger and swankier...

637
01:22:39,102 --> 01:22:41,730
than any of the rough joints
we've put in in Vegas.

638
01:22:41,838 --> 01:22:45,171
And we can thank our friends
in the Cuban government...

639
01:22:45,275 --> 01:22:48,267
which has put up half of the cash,
with the Teamsters...

640
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:49,902
on a dollar-for-dollar basis;

641
01:22:50,013 --> 01:22:52,846
has relaxed restrictions
on imports.

642
01:22:52,949 --> 01:22:57,340
What l'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed:

643
01:22:57,454 --> 01:23:00,218
real partnership
with a government.

644
01:23:00,323 --> 01:23:02,917
Smaller piece.

645
01:23:03,026 --> 01:23:05,586
You all know Michael Corleone...

646
01:23:05,695 --> 01:23:07,925
and we all remember his father.

647
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:11,660
At the time of my retirement
or death...

648
01:23:11,768 --> 01:23:16,228
l turn over all my interest
in the Havana operation...

649
01:23:16,339 --> 01:23:17,567
to his control.

650
01:23:17,674 --> 01:23:21,735
But all of you will share.

651
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:25,542
The Nacionale will go to
the Lakeville Road boys.

652
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:31,508
The Capri to the Corleone family.
The Sevilla Biltmore also.

653
01:23:31,621 --> 01:23:35,478
But Eddie Levine of Newport will
bring in the Pennino brothers...

654
01:23:35,592 --> 01:23:37,355
Dino and Eddie, for a piece...

655
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:40,293
and also to handle
the actual casino operations.

656
01:23:40,397 --> 01:23:43,924
And we've saved a piece for
some friends in Nevada...

657
01:23:44,034 --> 01:23:47,697
to make sure that things
go smooth back home.

658
01:23:47,804 --> 01:23:52,764
l want all of you
to enjoy your cake...

659
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:54,764
so enjoy.

660
01:23:54,878 --> 01:23:56,766
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

661
01:23:58,615 --> 01:24:02,574
l saw an interesting thing
happen today.

662
01:24:02,686 --> 01:24:05,814
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police...

663
01:24:05,922 --> 01:24:07,685
and rather than be taken alive...

664
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:10,419
he exploded a grenade he had
hidden in his jacket.

665
01:24:10,527 --> 01:24:13,917
He killed himself, and he took
a captain of the command with him.

666
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:16,225
- Right,Johnny?
- Those rebels, they're lunatics.

667
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:19,598
- Yes, l agree.
- Maybe so.

668
01:24:19,703 --> 01:24:21,295
But it occurred to me...

669
01:24:21,404 --> 01:24:24,737
the soldiers are paid to fight,
the rebels aren't.

670
01:24:24,841 --> 01:24:27,002
What does that tell you?

671
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:28,998
They could win.

672
01:24:30,847 --> 01:24:33,645
This country has had rebels
for the last 50 years.

673
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:38,380
lt's in their blood. l've been
coming here since the '20s.

674
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:42,310
We were running molasses out
of Havana when you were a baby...

675
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:46,020
the trucks owned by your father.

676
01:24:46,129 --> 01:24:48,620
Michael.

677
01:24:54,704 --> 01:24:57,593
l'd rather we talked about
this when we we're alone.

678
01:25:00,543 --> 01:25:03,432
The two million
never got to the island.

679
01:25:09,286 --> 01:25:12,414
l wouldn't want it to get around
that you held back the money...

680
01:25:12,522 --> 01:25:15,878
because you had second thoughts
about the rebels.

681
01:25:21,264 --> 01:25:24,188
Ah, sit down, Michael.

682
01:25:24,301 --> 01:25:26,189
Sit down.

683
01:25:32,676 --> 01:25:36,498
lf l could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

684
01:25:36,613 --> 01:25:38,945
Ohh.

685
01:25:39,049 --> 01:25:41,540
What l wouldn't give for...

686
01:25:41,618 --> 01:25:43,506
20 more years.

687
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,613
Here we are, protected--

688
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:49,783
free to make our profits without
Kefauver...

689
01:25:49,893 --> 01:25:53,590
the goddamn Justice
Department and the FBl--

690
01:25:53,697 --> 01:25:57,224
90 miles away, partnership
with a friendly government.

691
01:25:58,668 --> 01:26:02,866
Ninety miles. lt's nothing.

692
01:26:02,973 --> 01:26:05,533
Just one small step,
looking for a man...

693
01:26:05,642 --> 01:26:08,805
that wants to be President
of the United States...

694
01:26:08,912 --> 01:26:12,268
and having the cash
to make it possible.

695
01:26:12,382 --> 01:26:14,270
Michael...

696
01:26:15,885 --> 01:26:18,740
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

697
01:26:44,914 --> 01:26:47,303
Mikey, how are ya? Okay?

698
01:26:49,352 --> 01:26:52,082
Hiya. Freddie Corleone.

699
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:57,555
Jesus Christ, what a trip.

700
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,093
The whole time l'm thinkin'...

701
01:26:59,195 --> 01:27:01,288
''What if somebody knows
what l got in here?''

702
01:27:01,398 --> 01:27:05,721
lmagine that. Two million dollars
on the seat next to me.

703
01:27:05,835 --> 01:27:07,723
All right.

704
01:27:09,305 --> 01:27:11,694
- Whoops. Excuse me.
- No, it's okay.

705
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:15,898
You wanna count it?

706
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:23,808
Mikey, what the hell's
goin' on anyway?

707
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,150
The family's making
an investment in Havana.

708
01:27:26,256 --> 01:27:29,589
- This is a gift for the president.
- Oh.

709
01:27:29,692 --> 01:27:31,648
Well, that's great.

710
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:33,649
Havana's great.

711
01:27:34,764 --> 01:27:36,652
lt's my kind of town.

712
01:27:38,201 --> 01:27:40,294
- Anybody l know in Havana?
- l don't know.

713
01:27:40,403 --> 01:27:42,359
Hyman Roth? Johnny Ola?

714
01:27:45,842 --> 01:27:48,367
No. l never met them.

715
01:27:52,148 --> 01:27:54,446
Listen, Mikey...

716
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:56,439
l'm kind of, uh--

717
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:01,388
kind of nervous from the trip.

718
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:05,120
Uh, can l-- can l get
a, uh, drink or somethin'?

719
01:28:05,228 --> 01:28:08,493
l thought maybe we'd--
we'd go out together.

720
01:28:08,598 --> 01:28:11,487
l know a place we can spend
some time together. Okay?

721
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:17,166
Sometimes l think l should've
married a woman like you did...

722
01:28:17,273 --> 01:28:19,662
like Kay.

723
01:28:19,776 --> 01:28:22,165
Have kids, have a family.

724
01:28:24,848 --> 01:28:28,238
For once in my life
be more like...

725
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:31,244
Pop.

726
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:38,245
lt's not easy to be a son,
Fredo. lt's not easy.

727
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:41,489
Mama used to tease me. She'd say,
''You don't belong to me.

728
01:28:41,598 --> 01:28:45,125
You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies.''

729
01:28:45,235 --> 01:28:48,090
Sometimes l think it's true.

730
01:28:48,204 --> 01:28:50,092
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

731
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:53,732
Mikey, l--

732
01:28:53,843 --> 01:28:55,731
l was mad at you.

733
01:29:02,986 --> 01:29:06,911
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

734
01:29:07,023 --> 01:29:09,412
You want a drink, right?
Waiter.

735
01:29:17,233 --> 01:29:20,088
- How do you say banana daiquiri?
- Banana daiquiri.

736
01:29:20,203 --> 01:29:22,467
- That's it?
- That's it.

737
01:29:22,572 --> 01:29:25,461
- Uh, uno banana daiquiri.
- Banana daiquiri. Si, senor.

738
01:29:25,575 --> 01:29:27,964
And, uh, a club soda.

739
01:29:35,818 --> 01:29:38,616
Senator Geary's flying in
from Washington tomorrow night...

740
01:29:38,721 --> 01:29:41,110
with some people,
some government people...

741
01:29:41,224 --> 01:29:44,387
and l want you to show 'em
a good time in Havana.

742
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:49,152
lt's my specialty, right?

743
01:29:49,265 --> 01:29:52,428
- Can l trust you with something?
- Of course, Mike.

744
01:29:56,206 --> 01:29:59,562
ln the evening, we're all invited
to the presidential palace...

745
01:29:59,676 --> 01:30:02,236
a reception to bring in
the new year.

746
01:30:02,345 --> 01:30:04,233
After it's over...

747
01:30:04,347 --> 01:30:06,872
they're gonna take me home
in a military car...

748
01:30:06,983 --> 01:30:10,680
alone, for my protection...

749
01:30:10,787 --> 01:30:14,177
and before l reach my hotel
l'll be assassinated.

750
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:35,602
- Who?
- Roth.

751
01:30:41,417 --> 01:30:44,306
lt was Roth who tried
to kill me in my home.

752
01:30:46,122 --> 01:30:48,181
lt was Roth all along.

753
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:53,524
He acts like l'm his son,
his successor...

754
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:56,554
but he thinks he's gonna live
forever and he wants me out.

755
01:31:01,671 --> 01:31:02,763
How can l help?

756
01:31:02,872 --> 01:31:06,228
You just go along
as though you know nothing.

757
01:31:06,342 --> 01:31:10,267
- l've already made my move.
- What move?

758
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,871
Hyman Roth'll never see
the new year.

759
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:32,793
He says you have to take it easy
and he'll give you a prescription.

760
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:34,164
He'll be back tomorrow.

761
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:36,693
l want my own doctor.
Fly him in from Miami.

762
01:31:36,806 --> 01:31:39,001
l don't trust a doctor
can't speak English.

763
01:31:45,381 --> 01:31:47,269
Honey, go down to the casino.

764
01:31:47,383 --> 01:31:50,773
- lf you're sure you're better.
- Feel fine.

765
01:31:52,755 --> 01:31:55,519
- Play the bingo game.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

766
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:57,581
-Just make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

767
01:31:59,462 --> 01:32:00,861
My sixth sense tells me...

768
01:32:00,963 --> 01:32:03,488
your brother Fredo brought
a bag full of money.

769
01:32:03,599 --> 01:32:06,762
Where is it?

770
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:09,292
You're pulling out?

771
01:32:09,405 --> 01:32:13,296
Just wanna--
l just wanna wait.

772
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:19,273
How do you feel?

773
01:32:19,382 --> 01:32:21,577
Terrible. l'd give four million...

774
01:32:21,684 --> 01:32:24,915
just to be able to take a piss
without it hurting.

775
01:32:25,021 --> 01:32:28,320
Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?

776
01:32:28,424 --> 01:32:30,790
The Rosato brothers.

777
01:32:30,893 --> 01:32:34,454
l know. But who gave
the go-ahead?

778
01:32:34,564 --> 01:32:37,453
l know l didn't.

779
01:32:44,674 --> 01:32:47,199
There was this kid
l grew up with.

780
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,471
He was younger than me.

781
01:32:49,579 --> 01:32:52,070
Sort of looked up to me,
you know.

782
01:32:52,181 --> 01:32:55,742
We did our first work together.

783
01:32:55,852 --> 01:32:57,911
Worked our way
out of the street.

784
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,011
Things were good.
We made the most of it.

785
01:33:01,357 --> 01:33:03,848
During Prohibition...

786
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,916
we ran molasses into Canada.

787
01:33:06,028 --> 01:33:08,519
Made a fortune. Your father too.

788
01:33:11,033 --> 01:33:14,059
As much as anyone...

789
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,695
l loved him and trusted him.

790
01:33:19,742 --> 01:33:23,200
Later on he had an idea...

791
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:25,473
to build a city...

792
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:29,278
out of a desert stopover for G.l.s
on their way to the West Coast.

793
01:33:31,354 --> 01:33:35,051
That kid's name was Moe Green...

794
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:38,389
and the city he invented
was Las Vegas.

795
01:33:40,129 --> 01:33:42,552
This was a great man...

796
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:45,156
a man of vision and guts...

797
01:33:45,268 --> 01:33:50,433
and there isn't even a plaque
or a signpost or a statue of him...

798
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:53,429
in that town.

799
01:33:53,543 --> 01:33:57,001
Someone put a bullet
through his eye.

800
01:33:58,381 --> 01:34:01,612
No one knows
who gave the order.

801
01:34:01,717 --> 01:34:04,845
When l heard it l wasn't angry.

802
01:34:04,954 --> 01:34:06,979
l knew Moe;
l knew he was headstrong.

803
01:34:07,089 --> 01:34:10,980
Talking loud,
saying stupid things.

804
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:14,324
So when he turned up dead...

805
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:17,627
l let it go...

806
01:34:17,733 --> 01:34:20,964
and l said to myself...

807
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:24,961
''This is the business
we've chosen.''

808
01:34:25,074 --> 01:34:27,872
l didn't ask...

809
01:34:27,977 --> 01:34:29,865
who gave the order...

810
01:34:29,979 --> 01:34:32,903
because it had nothing
to do with business.

811
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:45,448
That two million
in a bag in your room--

812
01:34:48,397 --> 01:34:50,285
l'm going in...

813
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:52,458
to take a nap.

814
01:34:52,568 --> 01:34:54,661
When l wake...

815
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:58,433
if the money's on the table
l'll know l have a partner.

816
01:34:58,541 --> 01:35:00,930
lf it isn't,
l'll know l don't.

817
01:35:56,632 --> 01:35:58,759
All right, does everybody
know everybody here, huh?

818
01:35:58,868 --> 01:36:00,824
- This is Senator Geary.
- How are you, Senator?

819
01:36:00,937 --> 01:36:04,168
Good to see you, Mike. l'm glad
we could spend time together.

820
01:36:04,273 --> 01:36:07,333
- Senator Payton from Florida.
- How you doing, Mike?

821
01:36:07,443 --> 01:36:09,866
- And Judge DeMalco from New York.
- How do you do, sir?

822
01:36:09,979 --> 01:36:12,140
- Fine, thank you.
- Senator Ream from Maryland.

823
01:36:12,248 --> 01:36:15,547
- l've been looking forward to this.
- This is Fred Corngold from U.T.T.

824
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:19,143
- l know Fred. How are you?
- Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha.

825
01:36:19,255 --> 01:36:22,713
- Oh, he does, huh?
- Gentlemen, it's refill time.

826
01:36:22,825 --> 01:36:27,353
Try some of them local drinks--
uh, cuba libre, pina colada.

827
01:36:27,463 --> 01:36:31,320
l think l'll try one of
those redheaded Yolandas.

828
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:35,359
- That you got. Con gusto.
-Johnny.

829
01:36:35,471 --> 01:36:39,100
You don't know my brother Fredo,
do you,Johnny? Johnny Ola, Fredo.

830
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:41,369
- We never met.Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

831
01:36:44,046 --> 01:36:46,344
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana.

832
01:36:46,449 --> 01:36:48,337
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

833
01:36:49,685 --> 01:36:52,313
- Happy New Year.
- That's right, huh?

834
01:36:56,492 --> 01:36:59,825
- Checkin' in now. Right now.
- Never fear! Pat Geary's here!

835
01:36:59,929 --> 01:37:02,762
- Hey, Fred.
- Cheers! Hey!

836
01:37:02,865 --> 01:37:05,356
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standin'?
- Come on, man!

837
01:37:05,468 --> 01:37:08,232
Everybody stands,
but it's worth it.

838
01:37:08,337 --> 01:37:11,135
- You're not gonna believe this.
- l don't believe it already.

839
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,767
- That's right. Fifty dollars.
- You got a bet, mister.

840
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:25,710
That's him. That's Superman.

841
01:37:58,354 --> 01:38:00,948
-Jesus Christ!
- Did l tell ya, or did l tell ya?

842
01:38:02,725 --> 01:38:05,285
- l don't believe it.
- That thing's gotta be a fake.

843
01:38:05,394 --> 01:38:09,285
That ain't no fake. That's real.
That's why they call him Superman.

844
01:38:09,398 --> 01:38:13,391
Hey, Freddie. Freddie.
Where did you find this place?

845
01:38:13,502 --> 01:38:15,868
Johnny Ola told me about
this place. He brought me here.

846
01:38:15,971 --> 01:38:17,859
l didn't believe it,
but seein' is believin', huh?

847
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:21,431
- l see it and l don't believe it.
- Fifty bucks, Pat.

848
01:38:21,544 --> 01:38:23,102
Old man Roth'd never come here...

849
01:38:23,212 --> 01:38:26,067
but ol'Johnny knows these places
like the back of his hand.

850
01:38:26,182 --> 01:38:28,776
Now watch him. He's gonna
break the cracker with it.

851
01:38:28,884 --> 01:38:32,149
l wanna see him break a brick.

852
01:38:32,254 --> 01:38:34,643
He could knock down a building.

853
01:39:53,068 --> 01:39:56,265
Relax, Se§Ûor Roth. We're
taking you to the hospital.

854
01:40:45,421 --> 01:40:47,810
And in my judgment
you'll continue to get those...

855
01:40:47,923 --> 01:40:50,778
because l don't believe
that President Eisenhower...

856
01:40:50,893 --> 01:40:52,383
will ever pull out of Cuba.

857
01:40:52,461 --> 01:40:56,158
Not as long as we have over one billion
dollars invested in this country.

858
01:40:59,401 --> 01:41:02,962
Now, the American public
believes in nonintervention.

859
01:41:03,072 --> 01:41:05,961
Fredo. Where you goin'?

860
01:41:06,075 --> 01:41:09,272
l'm gonna get me a real drink,
'cause l can't--

861
01:42:05,301 --> 01:42:08,759
What kept Mr. Roth?
l understood he was coming.

862
01:42:08,871 --> 01:42:12,398
Ream, what's the protocol? How long
should we stay around here?

863
01:42:12,508 --> 01:42:15,397
Oh, l don't know. l think
a half hour oughta do it.

864
01:42:15,511 --> 01:42:18,002
Just long enough
to bring in the new year.

865
01:43:52,508 --> 01:43:56,501
There's a plane waiting for us
to take us to Miami in an hour.

866
01:43:56,612 --> 01:43:59,001
Don't make a big thing about it.

867
01:44:03,085 --> 01:44:05,474
l know it was you, Fredo.

868
01:44:05,587 --> 01:44:08,385
You broke my heart.

869
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:11,516
You broke my heart.

870
01:45:52,694 --> 01:45:56,050
Fredo! Come on.

871
01:45:56,165 --> 01:45:59,464
Come with me. lt's the only
way out of here tonight.

872
01:45:59,568 --> 01:46:02,162
Roth is dead. Fredo.

873
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:05,195
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother!

874
01:46:05,307 --> 01:46:08,140
Fredo! Fredo!

875
01:46:27,162 --> 01:46:28,993
U.S. passports only.

876
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:36,488
- U.S. passports only.
- l'm from the United States Senate.

877
01:46:39,174 --> 01:46:41,506
- Back, please.
- Please! l must leave!

878
01:47:49,911 --> 01:47:52,971
Al, get me a wet towel.

879
01:48:00,022 --> 01:48:01,910
Kay know l'm back?

880
01:48:06,728 --> 01:48:10,027
What about my boy? Did you get
him something for Christmas?

881
01:48:10,132 --> 01:48:13,624
- l took care of it.
- What was it so l'll know?

882
01:48:13,735 --> 01:48:17,193
lt was a little car with an electric
motor that he could ride in.

883
01:48:17,306 --> 01:48:19,194
lt was nice.

884
01:48:21,443 --> 01:48:24,276
Thank you, Al.

885
01:48:24,379 --> 01:48:26,802
Fellas, could you step outside
for a minute, please?

886
01:48:44,966 --> 01:48:46,854
Where's my brother?

887
01:48:46,968 --> 01:48:50,893
Uh, Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

888
01:48:51,006 --> 01:48:53,930
He had a stroke.
He recovered okay.

889
01:48:54,042 --> 01:48:58,536
- Your bodyguard's dead.
- l asked about Fredo.

890
01:48:58,647 --> 01:49:01,571
l think he got out. He must be
somewhere in New York.

891
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:07,511
All right.

892
01:49:07,622 --> 01:49:10,511
l want you to get
in touch with him.

893
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:13,651
l know he's scared.
Tell him everything's all right.

894
01:49:13,762 --> 01:49:15,423
Tell him l know Roth misled him;

895
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:18,124
that he didn't know
they were gonna try to kill me.

896
01:49:20,035 --> 01:49:22,299
And they can come in now.

897
01:49:22,404 --> 01:49:25,100
Oh, there was something else.

898
01:49:25,207 --> 01:49:27,835
What?

899
01:49:32,848 --> 01:49:34,770
What?
Come on. What?

900
01:49:37,285 --> 01:49:39,412
Kay had a miscarriage.
She lost the baby.

901
01:49:52,434 --> 01:49:54,823
- Was it a boy?
- After three and a half months--

902
01:49:54,936 --> 01:49:59,202
Can't you give me a straight answer
anymore? Was it a boy?

903
01:50:01,877 --> 01:50:03,765
l really don't know.

904
01:54:34,315 --> 01:54:35,247
l take care of everything.

905
01:56:17,318 --> 01:56:19,274
Vito, here's my $50.

906
01:56:38,406 --> 01:56:42,365
l'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

907
02:09:35,282 --> 02:09:38,137
From the year 1 94 2
to the present time...

908
02:09:38,251 --> 02:09:41,846
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

909
02:09:41,955 --> 02:09:43,513
That's right.

910
02:09:44,624 --> 02:09:48,481
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization?

911
02:09:51,765 --> 02:09:55,462
We called it the Corleone family,
Senator. We called it the family.

912
02:09:55,569 --> 02:09:57,958
What was your position?

913
02:09:59,106 --> 02:10:01,961
At first, like everybody else,
l was a soldier.

914
02:10:02,075 --> 02:10:05,499
- What is that?
- A button. You know, come on.

915
02:10:05,612 --> 02:10:07,876
No, l don't know. Tell me.

916
02:10:09,616 --> 02:10:13,746
When the boss says ''push a button
on a guy,'' l push a button.

917
02:10:13,854 --> 02:10:16,345
- See, Senator?
- Mr. Questadt.

918
02:10:16,456 --> 02:10:19,345
- You mean you killed people?
- What?

919
02:10:19,459 --> 02:10:24,419
You killed people
at the behest of your superiors?

920
02:10:28,335 --> 02:10:29,563
Yeah, that's right, counselor.

921
02:10:29,669 --> 02:10:35,301
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

922
02:10:35,408 --> 02:10:38,468
Yeah, counselor, Michael Corleone,
right.

923
02:10:38,578 --> 02:10:41,968
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

924
02:10:43,083 --> 02:10:45,278
No, l never talked to him.

925
02:10:45,385 --> 02:10:49,173
Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit, please?

926
02:10:49,289 --> 02:10:51,018
Do what?

927
02:10:51,124 --> 02:10:55,413
Could you expand on your answer?
l'm interested in knowing...

928
02:10:55,529 --> 02:10:57,895
was there always a buffer involved?

929
02:10:58,832 --> 02:11:01,892
Someone in between you
and your possible superiors...

930
02:11:02,002 --> 02:11:05,426
- who gave the actual orders?
- Yeah, right, a buffer.

931
02:11:05,539 --> 02:11:08,702
The family had a lot of buffers.

932
02:11:08,809 --> 02:11:10,868
Mr. Cicci,
you may find this very amusing...

933
02:11:10,977 --> 02:11:13,935
but I promise you the members
of this committee do not.

934
02:13:33,853 --> 02:13:37,186
lf there's something l could do
for you, you come, we talk.

935
02:19:02,682 --> 02:19:06,504
The rent stays like before.

936
02:20:35,508 --> 02:20:40,434
Hey, what do you think?
God bless America. Big business.

937
02:20:47,453 --> 02:20:50,843
- New York City.
- Would you mind speaking up?

938
02:20:50,957 --> 02:20:52,879
New York City.

939
02:20:52,992 --> 02:20:56,189
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, l am.

940
02:20:56,295 --> 02:21:00,322
- And where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

941
02:21:00,433 --> 02:21:02,628
Did he, at times, use an alias...

942
02:21:02,735 --> 02:21:06,125
that was known in certain circles
as ''Godfather''?

943
02:21:07,039 --> 02:21:10,031
''Godfather'' is a term
that was used by his friends...

944
02:21:10,143 --> 02:21:14,000
one of affection,
one of respect.

945
02:21:14,113 --> 02:21:18,573
Mr. Chairman, I would like
to verify the witness's statement.

946
02:21:18,684 --> 02:21:21,244
For years now, a growing number
of my constituents...

947
02:21:21,354 --> 02:21:23,914
have been of ltalian descent...

948
02:21:24,023 --> 02:21:25,979
and l've come to know them well.

949
02:21:26,092 --> 02:21:31,257
They have honored me with their
support and with their friendship.

950
02:21:31,364 --> 02:21:34,527
lndeed, l can proudly say
that some of my very best friends...

951
02:21:34,634 --> 02:21:36,522
are ltalian-Americans.

952
02:21:37,537 --> 02:21:42,668
However, Mr. Chairman, at this time,
l have to leave these proceedings...

953
02:21:42,775 --> 02:21:47,633
to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

954
02:21:47,747 --> 02:21:50,875
But before l leave,
l do want to say this--

955
02:21:50,983 --> 02:21:55,511
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever...

956
02:21:55,621 --> 02:21:57,885
a slur upon
the great ltalian people...

957
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:01,221
because I can state from
my own knowledge and experience...

958
02:22:01,327 --> 02:22:04,990
that ltalian-Americans are among
the most loyal...

959
02:22:05,097 --> 02:22:07,395
most law-abiding, patriotic...

960
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:11,129
hard-working American citizens
in this land.

961
02:22:11,237 --> 02:22:13,660
And it would be a shame,
Mr. Chairman...

962
02:22:13,773 --> 02:22:15,934
if we allowed
a few rotten apples...

963
02:22:16,042 --> 02:22:18,738
to give a bad name
to the whole barrel...

964
02:22:18,845 --> 02:22:21,439
because from the time
of the great Christopher Columbus...

965
02:22:21,547 --> 02:22:24,311
up to the time of Enrico Fermi...

966
02:22:24,417 --> 02:22:26,408
right up until the present day...

967
02:22:26,519 --> 02:22:28,407
ltalian-Americans
have been pioneers...

968
02:22:28,521 --> 02:22:30,716
in building and defending
our great nation.

969
02:22:30,823 --> 02:22:33,053
They are the salt of the earth.

970
02:22:33,159 --> 02:22:36,048
They are one of the backbones
of this country.

971
02:22:40,233 --> 02:22:42,656
The chairman is calling
the meeting back to order.

972
02:22:42,768 --> 02:22:46,397
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

973
02:22:46,506 --> 02:22:50,431
Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been
advised as to your legal rights.

974
02:22:50,543 --> 02:22:54,206
We have testimony from a witness,
a previous witness...

975
02:22:54,313 --> 02:22:56,838
one Willi Cicci.

976
02:22:56,949 --> 02:22:58,837
He has stated that you are head...

977
02:22:58,951 --> 02:23:01,249
of the most powerful Mafia family
in this country.

978
02:23:01,354 --> 02:23:04,243
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

979
02:23:04,357 --> 02:23:07,849
The witness has testified that
you are personally responsible...

980
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:11,589
for the murder of a New York City
police captain in 1 94 7.

981
02:23:11,697 --> 02:23:15,428
And with him,
a man named Virgil Solozzo.

982
02:23:15,535 --> 02:23:17,799
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, l do.

983
02:23:17,904 --> 02:23:21,169
ls it true that in the year 1 950...

984
02:23:21,274 --> 02:23:25,631
you devised a murder of the heads
of the so-called ''five families''...

985
02:23:25,745 --> 02:23:28,043
in New York, to assume
and consolidate...

986
02:23:28,147 --> 02:23:30,536
your nefarious power?

987
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:34,472
- That's a complete falsehood.
- Is it true...

988
02:23:34,587 --> 02:23:38,444
you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

989
02:23:39,725 --> 02:23:43,354
No, it is not true. l own some stock
in some of the hotels there...

990
02:23:43,462 --> 02:23:45,521
but very little.

991
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:51,796
l also have stock in lBM and lT&T.

992
02:23:51,904 --> 02:23:57,262
Do you have any interests or control
over gambling and narcotics...

993
02:23:57,376 --> 02:23:58,866
in the state of New York?

994
02:23:58,945 --> 02:24:00,867
No, l do not.

995
02:24:00,980 --> 02:24:04,143
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement for this committee.

996
02:24:04,250 --> 02:24:08,038
Mr. Chairman,
l think this statement...

997
02:24:08,154 --> 02:24:10,349
is totally out of order
at this time.

998
02:24:10,456 --> 02:24:14,244
Sir, my client has answered every
question asked by this committee...

999
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:16,123
with the utmost sincerity.

1000
02:24:16,228 --> 02:24:19,152
He did not take the Fifth Amendment,
as it was his right to do...

1001
02:24:19,265 --> 02:24:21,927
so in all fairness l think
the statement should be heard.

1002
02:24:24,203 --> 02:24:27,366
No, l'm going to allow Mr. Corleone
to read his statement.

1003
02:24:27,473 --> 02:24:28,872
l'll put it in the record.

1004
02:24:30,876 --> 02:24:34,004
''ln the hopes of clearing
my family name...

1005
02:24:34,113 --> 02:24:36,673
and my sincere desire to give
my children their fair share...

1006
02:24:36,782 --> 02:24:38,841
of the American way of life
without a blemish...

1007
02:24:38,951 --> 02:24:41,283
on their name and background...

1008
02:24:41,387 --> 02:24:43,412
l have appeared
before this committee...

1009
02:24:43,522 --> 02:24:46,411
and given it all the cooperation
in my power.

1010
02:24:47,793 --> 02:24:50,751
l consider it a great dishonor
to me personally...

1011
02:24:50,863 --> 02:24:53,252
to have to deny
that l am a criminal.

1012
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:57,863
l wish to have the following
noted for the record:

1013
02:24:57,970 --> 02:25:01,997
that l served my country faithfully
and honorably in World War Two...

1014
02:25:02,108 --> 02:25:06,499
and was awarded a Navy Cross for
actions in defense of my country...

1015
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:12,471
that l have never been arrested or
indicted for any crime whatsoever...

1016
02:25:12,585 --> 02:25:16,646
that no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy...

1017
02:25:16,756 --> 02:25:19,384
whether it is called ''Mafia,''
''Cosa Nostra''...

1018
02:25:19,492 --> 02:25:21,380
or whatever other name
you wish to give...

1019
02:25:21,494 --> 02:25:22,893
has ever been made public.

1020
02:25:24,163 --> 02:25:26,996
I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment...

1021
02:25:27,099 --> 02:25:29,158
although it is my right to do so.

1022
02:25:32,204 --> 02:25:34,195
l challenge this committee...

1023
02:25:34,306 --> 02:25:37,764
to produce any witness
or evidence against me.

1024
02:25:37,877 --> 02:25:40,300
And if they do not...

1025
02:25:40,413 --> 02:25:43,871
l hope they will have the decency
to clear my name...

1026
02:25:43,983 --> 02:25:47,282
with the same publicity with which
they now have besmirched it.''

1027
02:25:48,954 --> 02:25:51,980
I'm sure we're all quite impressed,
Mr. Corleone...

1028
02:25:52,091 --> 02:25:54,582
particularly with your love
for our country.

1029
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:57,356
Committee will stand in recess
until 1 0:00 a.m. Monday morning...

1030
02:25:57,463 --> 02:25:59,351
at which time the committee
will produce a witness...

1031
02:25:59,465 --> 02:26:02,195
who will corroborate the charges
which were made against you today...

1032
02:26:02,301 --> 02:26:05,293
and at which time, Mr. Corleone,
you may very well be subject...

1033
02:26:05,404 --> 02:26:07,463
to indictment for perjury.

1034
02:26:07,573 --> 02:26:09,700
l remind you that
you're still under subpoena.

1035
02:26:09,809 --> 02:26:11,697
Adjourned.

1036
02:26:15,915 --> 02:26:18,713
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1037
02:26:18,818 --> 02:26:21,776
Ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth...

1038
02:26:21,887 --> 02:26:23,616
and l lose.

1039
02:26:23,723 --> 02:26:25,714
You sound like my bookie.

1040
02:26:25,825 --> 02:26:27,884
l owe that monkey my life.

1041
02:26:29,695 --> 02:26:31,720
Well, just get
a good night's sleep.

1042
02:26:31,831 --> 02:26:35,221
- Good night's sleep.
- Got a big day tomorrow.

1043
02:26:35,334 --> 02:26:38,258
Got you a new suit,
a new shirt, new tie.

1044
02:26:39,872 --> 02:26:42,261
l'm gonna shave you myself
in the morning.

1045
02:26:43,209 --> 02:26:47,168
You're gonna look respectable for
50 million of your fellow Americans.

1046
02:26:48,614 --> 02:26:53,506
My life won't be worth a nickel
after tomorrow.

1047
02:26:53,619 --> 02:26:57,009
Come on.
l saw this thing 1 9 times.

1048
02:26:58,390 --> 02:27:00,915
You got a great home here, Frankie.

1049
02:27:01,026 --> 02:27:04,985
The rest of your life, nobody gets
near you, you're not going anywhere.

1050
02:27:05,097 --> 02:27:08,328
That's great.
Beautiful.

1051
02:27:08,434 --> 02:27:10,390
Some deal l made.

1052
02:27:10,503 --> 02:27:13,267
You'll live like a king.
You'll be a hero.

1053
02:27:13,372 --> 02:27:16,432
You'll live better in here
than most people on the outside.

1054
02:27:16,542 --> 02:27:19,340
Some deal.
Jesus.

1055
02:27:21,113 --> 02:27:25,004
Alive.
Pentangeli is alive.

1056
02:27:26,886 --> 02:27:32,017
- How'd they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it.

1057
02:27:32,792 --> 02:27:35,215
Frankie went to make a deal
with the Rosato brothers...

1058
02:27:35,327 --> 02:27:37,420
and they tried to kill him.

1059
02:27:37,530 --> 02:27:39,418
He thought you double-crossed him.

1060
02:27:41,066 --> 02:27:43,330
Our people with the New York
detective said he was half dead...

1061
02:27:43,435 --> 02:27:47,132
scared stiff and calling out loud
that you turned on him.

1062
02:27:47,239 --> 02:27:49,969
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one...

1063
02:27:50,075 --> 02:27:51,963
and a lot more.

1064
02:27:53,479 --> 02:27:56,175
The FBl has him airtight.

1065
02:27:56,282 --> 02:27:59,137
He's on an army base,
24-hour guards.

1066
02:27:59,251 --> 02:28:01,446
No way we can get to him.

1067
02:28:01,554 --> 02:28:04,512
You've opened yourself
to five counts of perjury.

1068
02:28:06,725 --> 02:28:09,649
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1069
02:28:09,762 --> 02:28:12,458
He says he doesn't know anything,
and l believe him.

1070
02:28:13,399 --> 02:28:17,290
Roth-- he played this one
beautifully.

1071
02:28:25,444 --> 02:28:27,332
l want to talk to Fredo.

1072
02:29:07,086 --> 02:29:08,974
l haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1073
02:29:11,523 --> 02:29:14,014
We have time.

1074
02:29:14,126 --> 02:29:17,015
l was kept pretty much in the dark.

1075
02:29:18,697 --> 02:29:20,585
l didn't know all that much.

1076
02:29:21,867 --> 02:29:26,361
What about now? ls there anything
you can help me out with?

1077
02:29:27,172 --> 02:29:29,060
Anything you can tell me now?

1078
02:29:31,410 --> 02:29:33,799
They got Pentangeli,
that's all l can tell you.

1079
02:29:48,727 --> 02:29:52,254
l didn't know
it was gonna be a hit, Mike.

1080
02:29:52,364 --> 02:29:54,662
l swear to God,
l didn't know it was gonna be a hit.

1081
02:29:57,703 --> 02:30:02,094
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills...

1082
02:30:03,842 --> 02:30:06,231
and he said
that he wanted to talk.

1083
02:30:08,547 --> 02:30:11,311
He said that you and Roth...

1084
02:30:11,417 --> 02:30:14,807
were in on a big deal together...

1085
02:30:17,189 --> 02:30:21,421
and that there was something in it
for me if l could help him out.

1086
02:30:21,527 --> 02:30:25,349
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations.

1087
02:30:25,464 --> 02:30:29,855
But if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

1088
02:30:31,637 --> 02:30:33,867
it'd be good for the family.

1089
02:30:35,641 --> 02:30:37,700
You believed that story?

1090
02:30:37,810 --> 02:30:40,176
You believed that?

1091
02:30:40,279 --> 02:30:43,942
He said there was something in it
for me... on my own.

1092
02:30:44,049 --> 02:30:46,677
l've always taken care of you.

1093
02:30:46,785 --> 02:30:48,673
Taken care of me?

1094
02:30:49,788 --> 02:30:53,554
You're my kid brother.
You take care of me?

1095
02:30:53,659 --> 02:30:58,790
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1096
02:30:58,897 --> 02:31:02,287
Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that.

1097
02:31:03,736 --> 02:31:07,968
Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere.

1098
02:31:08,073 --> 02:31:10,962
Send Fredo to pick somebody up
at the airport.

1099
02:31:11,076 --> 02:31:14,375
l'm your older brother, Mike,
and l was stepped over!

1100
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:19,235
- That's the way Pop wanted it.
- lt ain't the way l wanted it!

1101
02:31:19,351 --> 02:31:21,842
l can handle things!
l'm smart!

1102
02:31:21,954 --> 02:31:25,913
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb. l'm smart...

1103
02:31:26,025 --> 02:31:28,084
and l want respect!

1104
02:31:36,001 --> 02:31:39,164
ls there anything you can tell me
about this investigation?

1105
02:31:39,271 --> 02:31:41,159
Anything more?

1106
02:31:49,214 --> 02:31:53,310
The Senate lawyer, Questadt...

1107
02:31:53,419 --> 02:31:54,977
he belongs to Roth.

1108
02:32:09,101 --> 02:32:11,160
You're nothing to me now.

1109
02:32:13,605 --> 02:32:15,800
You're not a brother,
you're not a friend.

1110
02:32:17,843 --> 02:32:20,641
l don't wanna know you
or what you do.

1111
02:32:21,814 --> 02:32:24,942
l don't wanna see you at the hotels.

1112
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:27,439
l don't want you near my house.

1113
02:32:29,588 --> 02:32:32,443
When you see our mother,
l wanna know a day in advance...

1114
02:32:32,558 --> 02:32:34,048
so l won't be there.

1115
02:32:35,961 --> 02:32:38,691
You understand?

1116
02:32:55,781 --> 02:32:59,638
l don't want anything to happen
to him while my mother's alive.

1117
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:53,197
There are more people
than a ball game in here.

1118
02:33:53,305 --> 02:33:55,193
There's Willi Cicci.

1119
02:34:17,262 --> 02:34:19,150
This committee will come to order.

1120
02:34:22,167 --> 02:34:24,829
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

1121
02:34:24,937 --> 02:34:28,634
- And where were you born?
- Partanego. Outside of Palermo.

1122
02:34:28,740 --> 02:34:30,970
Where do you live now?

1123
02:34:31,076 --> 02:34:35,467
l live in an army barracks
with the FBl guys.

1124
02:34:36,582 --> 02:34:41,747
We have here, finally, a witness
that will further testify...

1125
02:34:41,853 --> 02:34:44,549
to Michael Corleone's rule
over a criminal empire...

1126
02:34:44,656 --> 02:34:46,681
that controls all of the gambling
in this country...

1127
02:34:46,792 --> 02:34:48,191
and perhaps in other countries.

1128
02:34:48,293 --> 02:34:53,549
This witness had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

1129
02:34:53,665 --> 02:34:57,226
He can corroborate our charges on
enough counts for this committee...

1130
02:34:57,336 --> 02:35:01,693
to recommend a charge of perjury
against Michael Corleone.

1131
02:35:01,807 --> 02:35:03,502
- Senator.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1132
02:35:05,010 --> 02:35:06,238
Mr. Pentangeli.

1133
02:35:10,449 --> 02:35:13,577
Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

1134
02:35:13,685 --> 02:35:18,247
Did you serve under
caporegime Peter Clemenza...

1135
02:35:18,357 --> 02:35:23,021
under Vito Corleone,
also known as the ''Godfather''?

1136
02:35:29,368 --> 02:35:31,495
l never knew no Godfather.

1137
02:35:34,273 --> 02:35:36,161
l have my own family, Senator.

1138
02:35:40,145 --> 02:35:44,411
Mr. Pentangeli, you are
contradicting a sworn statement...

1139
02:35:44,516 --> 02:35:46,404
you'd previously made to me
and signed.

1140
02:35:46,518 --> 02:35:50,079
l ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...

1141
02:35:50,188 --> 02:35:54,716
were you at any time
a member of a crime organization...

1142
02:35:54,826 --> 02:35:56,225
headed by Michael Corleone?

1143
02:35:56,328 --> 02:36:00,025
l don't know nothing about that.

1144
02:36:03,101 --> 02:36:07,026
l was in the olive oil business
with his father...

1145
02:36:07,139 --> 02:36:09,528
but that was a long time ago,
that's all.

1146
02:36:10,676 --> 02:36:12,564
We have a sworn affidavit.

1147
02:36:14,079 --> 02:36:17,173
We have it--
your sworn affidavit...

1148
02:36:17,282 --> 02:36:19,773
that you murdered on
the orders of Michael Corleone.

1149
02:36:19,885 --> 02:36:22,046
Do you deny that confession?

1150
02:36:22,154 --> 02:36:24,918
And do you realize what will happen
as a result of your denial?

1151
02:36:25,023 --> 02:36:28,151
Look, the FBl guys,
they promised me a deal...

1152
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:31,991
so l made up a lot of stuff
about Michael Corleone...

1153
02:36:32,097 --> 02:36:34,053
'cause that's what they wanted.

1154
02:36:34,166 --> 02:36:37,988
But it was all lies--
everything.

1155
02:36:38,937 --> 02:36:41,303
And they kept saying...

1156
02:36:41,406 --> 02:36:43,567
Michael Corleone did this...

1157
02:36:43,675 --> 02:36:46,235
and that Michael Corleone did that.

1158
02:36:47,679 --> 02:36:51,775
So l said, ''Yeah, sure!''

1159
02:36:51,883 --> 02:36:55,478
Mr. Corleone, would you kindly
identify for the committee...

1160
02:36:55,587 --> 02:36:57,475
the gentleman sitting
to your left?

1161
02:36:57,589 --> 02:36:59,477
l can answer that.

1162
02:37:00,792 --> 02:37:03,784
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1163
02:37:03,895 --> 02:37:07,991
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, l believe, his brother.

1164
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:10,591
Will he come forward
and be sworn, sir?

1165
02:37:10,702 --> 02:37:13,398
Sir, this man
does not understand English.

1166
02:37:13,505 --> 02:37:17,134
He came at his own expense to aid
his brother in this time of trouble.

1167
02:37:17,242 --> 02:37:20,905
He's not under subpoena.
His reputation is impeccable.

1168
02:37:21,012 --> 02:37:22,877
Are you saying he knows nothing
about these matters?

1169
02:37:22,981 --> 02:37:24,380
To my knowledge, nothing.

1170
02:37:24,483 --> 02:37:27,441
l'm gonna find out
what the hell happened here.

1171
02:37:27,552 --> 02:37:29,543
All right, this committee
is now adjourned.

1172
02:37:29,654 --> 02:37:31,849
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

1173
02:37:34,226 --> 02:37:37,059
This committee owes an apology!

1174
02:37:37,162 --> 02:37:41,053
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator.

1175
02:38:08,927 --> 02:38:12,556
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hold on a minute.

1176
02:38:12,664 --> 02:38:15,360
The children are outside.
We're going.

1177
02:38:18,203 --> 02:38:20,501
What do you mean you're going?
We're all gonna leave tomorrow.

1178
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:26,998
l'll be in my room.

1179
02:38:30,415 --> 02:38:33,373
Michael, l'm not going
back to Nevada.

1180
02:38:33,485 --> 02:38:36,374
l brought the children
to say good-bye to you.

1181
02:38:40,258 --> 02:38:42,385
l want you to know
l'm very happy for you.

1182
02:38:42,494 --> 02:38:45,019
l suppose l always knew
you were too smart...

1183
02:38:45,130 --> 02:38:47,052
to let any of them
ever beat you.

1184
02:38:48,934 --> 02:38:53,394
- Why don't you sit down?
- l'm not going to stay long.

1185
02:38:53,505 --> 02:38:55,894
There are some things
l'd like to talk to you about.

1186
02:38:57,676 --> 02:39:00,065
Some things that have been
on my mind.

1187
02:39:01,346 --> 02:39:05,442
- Changes l wanna make.
- l think it's too late for changes.

1188
02:39:06,952 --> 02:39:09,045
l promised myself
l wasn't going to say anything.

1189
02:39:09,154 --> 02:39:12,578
You're too late.

1190
02:39:16,995 --> 02:39:19,384
What really happened
with Pentangeli?

1191
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:27,695
His brother came, helped him.

1192
02:39:27,806 --> 02:39:30,730
l didn't even know
he had a brother.

1193
02:39:30,842 --> 02:39:32,730
Where is he now?

1194
02:39:33,945 --> 02:39:36,368
He's on a plane back to Sicily.

1195
02:39:37,148 --> 02:39:39,571
All he had to do
was show his face.

1196
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:46,082
lt was between the brothers.
l had nothing to do with it.

1197
02:39:54,266 --> 02:39:59,363
Nobody is going--
not you, not the kids! You hear me?

1198
02:39:59,471 --> 02:40:03,168
You're my wife, they're my children.
l love you. l won't allow it.

1199
02:40:04,276 --> 02:40:08,133
You say you love me, then you
talk about allowing me to leave!

1200
02:40:08,246 --> 02:40:11,306
Things have been going on for years
between men and women...

1201
02:40:11,416 --> 02:40:13,304
- that will not change.
- You've become blind!

1202
02:40:13,418 --> 02:40:16,307
- Blind to what?
- Look what happened to us.

1203
02:40:16,421 --> 02:40:19,481
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened--

1204
02:40:19,591 --> 02:40:22,754
- Anthony is fine!
- Anthony is not fine!

1205
02:40:22,861 --> 02:40:24,783
- l don't wanna hear about it!
- You will!

1206
02:40:24,896 --> 02:40:27,421
Anthony's not fine!

1207
02:40:27,532 --> 02:40:29,159
l don't wanna hear about it!

1208
02:40:30,068 --> 02:40:31,626
Over!

1209
02:40:44,749 --> 02:40:47,638
At this moment,
l feel no love for you at all.

1210
02:40:49,321 --> 02:40:51,710
l never thought
that would ever happen...

1211
02:40:52,991 --> 02:40:54,549
but it has.

1212
02:41:13,597 --> 02:41:15,258
We're gonna leave tomorrow.

1213
02:41:16,366 --> 02:41:19,290
Okay? Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1214
02:41:19,402 --> 02:41:21,290
You haven't heard me.

1215
02:41:22,839 --> 02:41:25,603
What do you want from me?

1216
02:41:25,709 --> 02:41:27,802
Do you expect me to let you go?

1217
02:41:27,911 --> 02:41:31,699
Do you expect me to let you take
my children from me?

1218
02:41:32,816 --> 02:41:35,842
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1219
02:41:35,952 --> 02:41:37,977
That that could never happen?

1220
02:41:38,088 --> 02:41:42,081
That l'd use all my power to keep
something like that from happening?

1221
02:41:43,026 --> 02:41:45,290
Don't you know that?

1222
02:41:52,102 --> 02:41:54,935
Now, in time...

1223
02:41:55,038 --> 02:41:56,528
you'll feel differently.

1224
02:41:58,241 --> 02:42:00,835
You'll be glad l stopped you now.

1225
02:42:03,013 --> 02:42:04,969
l know that.

1226
02:42:07,150 --> 02:42:10,039
l know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1227
02:42:12,255 --> 02:42:14,382
Yes.

1228
02:42:14,491 --> 02:42:16,880
l know what that meant to you.

1229
02:42:19,462 --> 02:42:22,386
l'll make it up to you.

1230
02:42:22,499 --> 02:42:24,387
l swear, l'll make it up to you.

1231
02:42:26,603 --> 02:42:28,491
l'm gonna change.

1232
02:42:29,739 --> 02:42:31,468
l'll change.

1233
02:42:31,575 --> 02:42:34,066
l've learned that l have
the strength to change.

1234
02:42:36,413 --> 02:42:38,802
And you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

1235
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:41,808
and we'll have another child...

1236
02:42:41,918 --> 02:42:44,716
and we'll go on--
you and l.

1237
02:42:46,289 --> 02:42:48,177
We'll go on.

1238
02:42:51,861 --> 02:42:53,920
You are blind.

1239
02:42:55,632 --> 02:42:58,021
lt wasn't a miscarriage.

1240
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:01,628
lt was an abortion.

1241
02:43:03,406 --> 02:43:05,294
An abortion.

1242
02:43:06,209 --> 02:43:08,700
Just like our marriage
is an abortion.

1243
02:43:09,613 --> 02:43:12,741
Something that's unholy and evil.

1244
02:43:14,584 --> 02:43:17,712
l didn't want your son!

1245
02:43:17,821 --> 02:43:22,178
l wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1246
02:43:23,560 --> 02:43:26,051
lt was an abortion!

1247
02:43:26,129 --> 02:43:28,962
lt was a son! A son!
And l had it killed...

1248
02:43:29,065 --> 02:43:31,863
because this must all end!

1249
02:43:33,470 --> 02:43:37,531
l know now that it's over.
l knew it then.

1250
02:43:38,842 --> 02:43:41,208
There would be no way...

1251
02:43:41,311 --> 02:43:44,269
no way you could ever forgive me...

1252
02:43:44,381 --> 02:43:46,747
not with this Sicilian thing...

1253
02:43:46,850 --> 02:43:49,080
that's been going on
for 2,000 years--

1254
02:43:49,185 --> 02:43:51,073
Bitch!

1255
02:43:56,793 --> 02:44:00,058
- You won't take my children.
- l will.

1256
02:44:00,163 --> 02:44:04,054
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1257
02:45:34,090 --> 02:45:37,548
Fredo, here's this for Grandma.

1258
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:48,398
What are you doing?

1259
02:50:59,082 --> 02:51:00,970
Michael, say good-bye.

1260
02:52:18,494 --> 02:52:20,553
Can l speak with you
for a second?

1261
02:52:29,372 --> 02:52:33,433
- Where's Mike?
- Waiting for you to leave.

1262
02:52:37,046 --> 02:52:38,934
Can l talk with him?

1263
02:52:39,048 --> 02:52:40,936
Sorry, no chance.

1264
02:52:41,918 --> 02:52:44,807
- Can l see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1265
02:52:58,467 --> 02:53:00,355
Michael, it's Connie.

1266
02:53:26,629 --> 02:53:29,189
l'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1267
02:53:38,507 --> 02:53:40,532
ls Kay coming?

1268
02:53:53,122 --> 02:53:56,046
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1269
02:53:56,158 --> 02:54:00,049
He asked for you,
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1270
02:54:03,432 --> 02:54:05,354
That's right.

1271
02:54:07,937 --> 02:54:11,327
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1272
02:54:15,645 --> 02:54:17,704
Please, l wanna talk to you.

1273
02:54:29,592 --> 02:54:33,050
l hated you for so many years.

1274
02:54:33,162 --> 02:54:37,189
l think that l did things to myself,
to hurt myself...

1275
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:39,188
so that you'd know...

1276
02:54:42,271 --> 02:54:44,159
that l could hurt you.

1277
02:54:50,579 --> 02:54:54,675
You were just being strong
for all of us the way Papa was.

1278
02:54:55,618 --> 02:54:57,506
And l forgive you.

1279
02:55:01,891 --> 02:55:04,849
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1280
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:09,852
He's so sweet
and helpless without you.

1281
02:55:16,038 --> 02:55:19,565
You need me.
l want to take care of you now.

1282
02:57:14,990 --> 02:57:16,389
Sit down.

1283
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:30,933
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1284
02:57:32,808 --> 02:57:35,003
You hear about it?

1285
02:57:35,110 --> 02:57:36,998
l hear that he's in lsrael.

1286
02:57:38,113 --> 02:57:40,502
And the High Court in lsrael
turned down his request...

1287
02:57:40,616 --> 02:57:42,811
to live there as a returned Jew.

1288
02:57:42,918 --> 02:57:46,877
His passport's been invalidated,
except for return to the US.

1289
02:57:46,989 --> 02:57:49,480
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1290
02:57:49,592 --> 02:57:52,550
He offered a gift of a million
dollars if they let him live there.

1291
02:57:54,497 --> 02:57:56,385
They turned him down.

1292
02:57:56,499 --> 02:58:00,765
- He's gonna try Panama.
- Panama won't take him.

1293
02:58:00,870 --> 02:58:03,361
Not for a million,
not for ten million.

1294
02:58:03,472 --> 02:58:05,360
His medical condition
is reported as terminal.

1295
02:58:05,474 --> 02:58:08,398
He's only gonna live
another six months anyway.

1296
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:11,571
He's been dying of
the same heart attack for 20 years.

1297
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:16,845
- That plane goes to Miami.
- Right. That's where l want it met.

1298
02:58:16,952 --> 02:58:20,149
Mike, that's impossible.
They'll turn him over directly...

1299
02:58:20,256 --> 02:58:22,451
to the lnternal Revenue, Customs
and half the FBl.

1300
02:58:22,558 --> 02:58:25,789
lt's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1301
02:58:25,895 --> 02:58:28,261
lt would be like trying to kill
the president. No way to get to him.

1302
02:58:29,598 --> 02:58:31,486
You know, you surprise me.

1303
02:58:34,703 --> 02:58:38,366
lf anything in this life
is certain--

1304
02:58:38,474 --> 02:58:40,738
if history's taught us anything...

1305
02:58:41,644 --> 02:58:44,272
it's that you can kill anyone.

1306
02:58:51,620 --> 02:58:54,646
Difficult, not impossible.

1307
02:58:54,757 --> 02:58:57,021
Good.

1308
02:58:59,261 --> 02:59:02,492
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when l came in?

1309
02:59:06,101 --> 02:59:10,094
l thought you were
gonna tell me that...

1310
02:59:10,205 --> 02:59:12,093
you were moving
your family to Vegas.

1311
02:59:13,876 --> 02:59:19,508
And that you'd been offered the
vice presidency of the hotels there.

1312
02:59:19,615 --> 02:59:21,640
- l thought you'd tell me that.
- l turned them down.

1313
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:23,479
Do l have to tell you
about every offer that l turn down?

1314
02:59:28,691 --> 02:59:29,817
Let's do business.

1315
02:59:29,925 --> 02:59:32,314
All right.

1316
02:59:33,362 --> 02:59:35,421
Just consider this.
Just consider it.

1317
02:59:37,499 --> 02:59:39,160
Now, Roth and the Rosatos
are on the run.

1318
02:59:39,268 --> 02:59:42,226
Are they worth it,
and are they strong enough?

1319
02:59:42,338 --> 02:59:46,160
ls it worth it?
l mean, you won.

1320
02:59:46,275 --> 02:59:48,163
Do you want to wipe
everybody out?

1321
02:59:48,277 --> 02:59:51,235
l don't feel l have to wipe
everybody out--

1322
02:59:51,347 --> 02:59:54,475
just my enemies, that's all.

1323
03:00:00,723 --> 03:00:03,419
You gonna come along with me on
these things l have to do or what?

1324
03:00:05,861 --> 03:00:10,355
'Cause if not, you can take your
wife, family and your mistress...

1325
03:00:10,466 --> 03:00:12,855
move them all to Las Vegas.

1326
03:00:17,539 --> 03:00:22,363
Why do you hurt me? l've always been
loyal to you. l mean, what is this?

1327
03:00:36,125 --> 03:00:38,047
What is it that you want me to do?

1328
03:00:41,397 --> 03:00:45,458
How would you like it if l taught
you how to catch really big fish?

1329
03:00:45,567 --> 03:00:48,365
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1330
03:00:48,470 --> 03:00:51,325
You know, when l was your age...

1331
03:00:51,440 --> 03:00:54,830
l went out fishing
with all my brothers...

1332
03:00:54,943 --> 03:00:57,332
and my father...

1333
03:00:57,446 --> 03:00:59,471
everybody...

1334
03:00:59,581 --> 03:01:02,470
and l was the only one
that caught a fish.

1335
03:01:03,952 --> 03:01:06,318
Nobody else could catch one,
except me.

1336
03:01:06,422 --> 03:01:08,310
You know how l did it?

1337
03:01:09,858 --> 03:01:13,453
Every time l put the line
in the water, l said a Hail Mary.

1338
03:01:13,562 --> 03:01:16,451
And every time l said a Hail Mary,
l caught a fish.

1339
03:01:19,835 --> 03:01:22,258
You believe that?
lt's true.

1340
03:01:22,371 --> 03:01:24,259
That's the secret.

1341
03:01:25,908 --> 03:01:28,706
Wanna try it
when we go on the lake?

1342
03:01:28,811 --> 03:01:32,941
Okay.
What else you got?

1343
03:01:59,575 --> 03:02:02,100
Things are gonna be okay, Frankie.
Don't worry.

1344
03:02:02,211 --> 03:02:06,136
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah. Don't worry.

1345
03:02:06,248 --> 03:02:09,308
He's ten times tougher than me--
my brother.

1346
03:02:09,418 --> 03:02:12,251
He's old-fashioned.

1347
03:02:12,354 --> 03:02:15,517
He didn't wanna go out to dinner.
He just wanted to go straight home.

1348
03:02:15,624 --> 03:02:17,546
That's my brother.
There's nothing...

1349
03:02:17,659 --> 03:02:20,719
that could get him away
from that two-meal town.

1350
03:02:20,829 --> 03:02:23,718
He could've been big here,
could've had his own family.

1351
03:02:32,541 --> 03:02:34,429
What do l do now?

1352
03:02:42,584 --> 03:02:45,473
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1353
03:02:48,090 --> 03:02:51,480
l remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1354
03:02:51,593 --> 03:02:54,983
l still read a lot.
l get good stuff in there.

1355
03:02:57,900 --> 03:03:00,289
You were around the old-timers...

1356
03:03:00,402 --> 03:03:03,599
agreeing about how the family's
should be organized...

1357
03:03:03,705 --> 03:03:06,697
based on the old home allegiance
and called them regimes--

1358
03:03:06,809 --> 03:03:09,198
capos and soldiers.

1359
03:03:10,379 --> 03:03:12,301
And it worked.

1360
03:03:12,414 --> 03:03:14,939
Yeah, it worked.

1361
03:03:15,050 --> 03:03:18,679
Those were the great old days,
you know?

1362
03:03:18,787 --> 03:03:21,847
And we was like the Roman Empire.

1363
03:03:21,957 --> 03:03:25,347
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1364
03:03:29,898 --> 03:03:31,786
lt was once.

1365
03:03:48,951 --> 03:03:53,547
When a plot
against the emperor failed...

1366
03:03:53,655 --> 03:03:56,283
the plotters were always given
a chance...

1367
03:03:59,061 --> 03:04:01,450
to let the families
keep their fortunes.

1368
03:04:02,564 --> 03:04:04,759
Yeah, but only the rich guys.

1369
03:04:04,867 --> 03:04:07,062
The little guys,
they got knocked off...

1370
03:04:07,169 --> 03:04:09,899
and all their estates
went to the emperors...

1371
03:04:10,005 --> 03:04:12,963
unless they went home
and killed themselves.

1372
03:04:13,075 --> 03:04:14,963
Then nothing happened to them.

1373
03:04:16,445 --> 03:04:20,336
And their families
were taken care of.

1374
03:04:22,484 --> 03:04:26,215
That was a good break.
Nice deal.

1375
03:04:26,321 --> 03:04:27,720
Yeah.

1376
03:04:28,824 --> 03:04:30,712
They went home...

1377
03:04:32,094 --> 03:04:35,222
and sat in a hot bath...

1378
03:04:35,330 --> 03:04:37,821
opened up their veins...

1379
03:04:37,933 --> 03:04:40,322
and bled to death.

1380
03:04:41,904 --> 03:04:44,793
And sometimes they had
a little party before they did it.

1381
03:04:51,246 --> 03:04:53,908
Don't worry about anything.

1382
03:04:54,950 --> 03:04:57,839
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1383
03:05:16,571 --> 03:05:18,129
See you, Tom.

1384
03:05:31,753 --> 03:05:34,415
You have to go.

1385
03:05:35,624 --> 03:05:38,513
- So pretty.
- Please hurry. He's coming.

1386
03:05:40,996 --> 03:05:43,885
Go rest.

1387
03:05:50,138 --> 03:05:52,026
Kiss Mama good-bye.

1388
03:05:54,810 --> 03:05:56,903
Will you kiss your mother good-bye?

1389
03:05:57,012 --> 03:05:58,900
Say good-bye to Mama.

1390
03:06:00,382 --> 03:06:02,270

Come here.

Please, kiss me once.

1394
03:08:17,619 --> 03:08:19,746
Easy.

1395
03:08:28,497 --> 03:08:31,261
He's here!
We're going fishing!

1396
03:08:31,366 --> 03:08:34,028
Michael wants to take him
to Reno now!

1397
03:08:34,136 --> 03:08:36,195
Oh, shit.

1398
03:08:38,306 --> 03:08:41,195
Okay, kid, you gotta go to Reno
with your pop.

1399
03:08:42,744 --> 03:08:45,542
Come on, l'll take you
fishing tomorrow, okay?

1400
03:08:45,647 --> 03:08:47,046
Okay.

1401
03:08:49,484 --> 03:08:51,975
Attaboy.
Hey, Anthony.

1402
03:08:52,053 --> 03:08:56,513
Listen. l'll catch one for you
in secret, huh? All right?

1403
03:08:56,625 --> 03:08:58,513
Okay, go ahead.

1404
03:08:59,461 --> 03:09:00,519
Okay, let's go.

1405
03:09:40,802 --> 03:09:43,191
Mr. Roth, you understand
l'll have to take you into custody?

1406
03:09:43,305 --> 03:09:45,193
Yes, l understand.

1407
03:09:45,307 --> 03:09:48,231
Can you give us your reaction to
the High Court of lsrael's ruling?

1408
03:09:48,343 --> 03:09:51,301
l'm a retired investor
on a pension.

1409
03:09:51,413 --> 03:09:54,769
l went to lsrael because l wished
to live there as Jew...

1410
03:09:54,883 --> 03:09:56,441
in the twilight of my life.

1411
03:10:02,857 --> 03:10:05,746
Hey, Frankie, come on out!
Let's play some hearts!

1412
03:10:31,953 --> 03:10:34,786
ls it true you're worth
over $300 million, Mr. Roth?

1413
03:10:34,889 --> 03:10:38,780
l'm a retired investor
living on a pension.

1414
03:10:38,893 --> 03:10:42,590
l came home to vote
in the presidential election...

1415
03:10:42,697 --> 03:10:45,860
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1416
03:10:58,380 --> 03:11:00,871
Jesus Christ.

1417
03:11:00,949 --> 03:11:05,113
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1418
03:11:05,220 --> 03:11:07,950
the Lord is with thee.

1419
03:11:08,056 --> 03:11:11,355
Blessed are thou amongst women.

1420
03:11:11,459 --> 03:11:14,348
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

1421
03:11:15,997 --> 03:11:19,728
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1422
03:12:01,710 --> 03:12:05,476
Hey, everybody,
come on, pay attention. Come here.

1423
03:12:05,580 --> 03:12:08,708
This is my friend, Carlo Rizzi.
My brother, Fredo.

1424
03:12:08,817 --> 03:12:10,546
- You know Fredo.
- Sure.

1425
03:12:10,652 --> 03:12:15,385
Here's my stepbrother, Tom.
That's his girl, Theresa.

1426
03:12:15,490 --> 03:12:18,687
This cute little thing over here's
my sister Connie l told you about.

1427
03:12:18,793 --> 03:12:21,591
Come on, say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, ain't he?

1428
03:12:21,696 --> 03:12:23,493
Yes.

1429
03:12:23,598 --> 03:12:26,192
Oh, that droopy thing over there,
that's my brother, Mike.

1430
03:12:26,301 --> 03:12:29,031
We call him Joe Collar, you know
what l mean? Go on, sit down.

1431
03:12:29,137 --> 03:12:32,368
- Go ahead. Talk to each other.
- Sit down.

1432
03:12:32,474 --> 03:12:34,362
Hey, Mr. Einstein.

1433
03:12:37,679 --> 03:12:40,568
- Here's the cake.
- Hey, get in here.

1434
03:12:43,251 --> 03:12:46,140
- Where's your father?
- On a wild goose chase.

1435
03:12:46,254 --> 03:12:48,643
- Here.
- Let's see that thing.

1436
03:12:50,024 --> 03:12:52,686
- Oh, honey, that's nice.
- That's beautiful.

1437
03:12:52,794 --> 03:12:55,319
- Should l put the candles on now?
- Go on. You help her, all right?

1438
03:12:55,430 --> 03:12:56,829
Sure.

1439
03:12:57,999 --> 03:13:00,593
- What is that, rum?
- Yeah.

1440
03:13:06,207 --> 03:13:09,540
Sonny, come on, don't touch
the antipasto till Pop sees it.

1441
03:13:17,552 --> 03:13:21,044
What do you think, the nerve of them
Japs, them slanty-eyed bastards?

1442
03:13:21,156 --> 03:13:23,454
Dropping bombs on our own backyard.
On Pop's birthday, you know?

1443
03:13:23,558 --> 03:13:26,982
They didn't know
it was Pop's birthday.

1444
03:13:27,095 --> 03:13:29,825
Well, we should've expected it
after the oil embargo.

1445
03:13:29,931 --> 03:13:32,559
What do you mean, expected it?
They got no right dropping bombs.

1446
03:13:32,667 --> 03:13:34,828
What are you, a Jap lover?
You on their side?

1447
03:13:34,936 --> 03:13:36,892
l understand 30,000 men enlisted
this morning.

1448
03:13:37,005 --> 03:13:39,667
- Bunch of saps.
- Why are they saps?

1449
03:13:39,774 --> 03:13:42,140
Come on, do we even have to talk
about the war?

1450
03:13:42,243 --> 03:13:44,006
You talk to Carlo, all right?

1451
03:13:46,314 --> 03:13:50,341
They're saps because
they risk their lives for strangers.

1452
03:13:50,452 --> 03:13:54,240
- That's Pop talking.
- You're goddamn right.

1453
03:13:54,355 --> 03:13:55,879
They risk their lives
for their country.

1454
03:13:55,990 --> 03:13:57,685
Country ain't your blood.
You remember that.

1455
03:13:57,792 --> 03:14:00,022
- l don't feel that way.
- ''l don't feel that way.''

1456
03:14:00,128 --> 03:14:03,586
lf you don't feel like that,
quit college and join the army.

1457
03:14:03,698 --> 03:14:05,188
l did.

1458
03:14:06,301 --> 03:14:08,030
l enlisted in the Marines.

1459
03:14:11,706 --> 03:14:14,937
- Mike, why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1460
03:14:15,043 --> 03:14:18,206
Pop had to pull a lot of strings
to get you a deferment.

1461
03:14:18,313 --> 03:14:19,371
l didn't ask for it.

1462
03:14:19,481 --> 03:14:21,608
l didn't ask for a deferment.
l didn't want it.

1463
03:14:23,351 --> 03:14:25,842
Come on, knock it off! Come on!

1464
03:14:25,954 --> 03:14:27,945
Punk.

1465
03:14:28,056 --> 03:14:29,717
- Go on.
- Sit down.

1466
03:14:32,594 --> 03:14:35,791
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1467
03:14:39,567 --> 03:14:41,455
Go show Carlo the tree.

1468
03:14:52,146 --> 03:14:53,545
Nice.

1469
03:14:58,119 --> 03:15:01,008
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1470
03:15:01,789 --> 03:15:04,485
That's swell. Congratulations.

1471
03:15:04,592 --> 03:15:08,255
That's right, encourage him.
Go on, get me a drink.

1472
03:15:09,130 --> 03:15:11,291
Go on.

1473
03:15:13,868 --> 03:15:16,962
l don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1474
03:15:17,071 --> 03:15:21,235
Many times, he and l have talked
about your future.

1475
03:15:23,144 --> 03:15:24,907
You talked to my father
about my future?

1476
03:15:28,216 --> 03:15:32,141
- My future?
- He has high hopes for you.

1477
03:15:32,253 --> 03:15:34,380
l have my own plans
for my future.

1478
03:15:35,323 --> 03:15:37,985
Did you go to college to get stupid?
You're really stupid.

1479
03:15:38,092 --> 03:15:39,980
He's here, come on!

1480
03:15:42,297 --> 03:15:44,527
Come on.

1481
03:15:46,434 --> 03:15:47,833
Stupid.

1482
03:16:04,852 --> 03:16:08,515
Surprise!

1483
03:16:08,623 --> 03:16:12,889
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1484
03:16:12,994 --> 03:16:16,555
For he's a jolly good fellow

1485
03:16:16,664 --> 03:16:18,757
Which nobody can deny
