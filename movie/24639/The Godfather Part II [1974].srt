1
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,640
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,480
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
My son...

5
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,480
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,440
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,120
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,280
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,800
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,360
He never speaks.

11
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,920
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,320
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,280
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,160
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,760
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,640
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,160
He's all I have left.

18
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,320
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,840
Move and I'll kill him!

20
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
Run, Vito!

21
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,480
Kill him!

22
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,680
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

23
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,680
You understand?

24
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,880
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

25
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
Vito, we're praying for you!

26
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,040
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

27
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,560
...turn him over to us.

28
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,920
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

29
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,720
lt'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

30
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,120
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

31
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,240
Nurse.

32
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,960
Money?

33
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Interpreter!

34
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,200
Where are you from?

35
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,400
- What is your name?
- Maria.

36
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
What is your name?

37
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,000
Come on, son. What is your name?

38
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,120
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

39
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,360
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

40
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,280
Okay, over there.

41
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,120
Next.

42
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,600
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

43
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,360
Vito Corleone!

44
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,320
Vito Corleone!

45
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
Here he is. This is him.

46
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,640
Did you bring the car keys?

47
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,120
Laurie! Laurie!

48
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,600
Mama!

49
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,400
Mama!

50
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,880
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

51
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,160
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

52
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
Mama!

53
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,600
- Here I am.
- Constanzia, after one week?

54
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,480
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

55
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,360
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

56
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,600
- What is this?
- You remember Merle?

57
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,360
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

58
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,440
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

59
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,080
You go see your children first.

60
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,640
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

61
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,480
Ladies and gentlemen...

62
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

63
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.

64
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,560
And there is Mrs Geary.

65
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Thank you very much.

66
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,480
This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs Geary.

67
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,600
We see Nevada far too seldom.

68
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,520
But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends,

69
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.

70
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,080
And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.

71
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,320
I have here in my hand a cheque
made out to the university,

72
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,120
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of...

73
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,000
...Anthony Vito Corleone.

74
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,120
The cheque is signed by
that young man's parents,

75
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,960
whom I think we should recognise.

76
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Mike, Pat, Kay - stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!

77
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,400
Folks, I want you to join me

78
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,120
in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr and Mrs Michael Corleone!

79
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,680
We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir,

80
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,840
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement

81
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,840
to honour their host,
Mr Michael Corleone.

82
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,480
Boys.

83
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,320
The plaque.

84
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,960
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

85
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Okay, that's good.

86
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,880
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs Corleone.

87
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,360
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

88
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,520
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

89
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,680
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

90
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,040
I thought that you and I
would talk alone.

91
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,480
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

92
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,800
Well, it's perfectly all right with me,

93
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,480
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

94
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,760
Maybe more frankly than anyone in my
position has ever talked to you before.

95
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,800
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

96
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,800
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas,

97
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,240
and one in Reno.
The licences were grandfathered in,

98
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,680
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

99
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,360
Now my sources tell me

100
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,160
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

101
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,040
They tell me that, within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

102
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,720
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

103
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,120
The licence will still be
in Klingman's name.

104
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,800
- Turnbull is a good man.
- Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

105
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,240
I don't want to spend more time here
than I have to. You can have the licence.

106
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,760
The price is 250,000 dollars.

107
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,720
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly,

108
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,200
of all four hotels, Mr Corleone.

109
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,320
The price for the licence
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

110
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,680
That's right.

111
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,080
- Why would I pay more than that?
- Because I intend to squeeze you.

112
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,720
I don't like your kind of people.

113
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,880
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair,

114
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,440
dressed up in those silk suits

115
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,320
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

116
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,840
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

117
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,240
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

118
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,200
Senator...

119
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
...we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

120
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,000
But never think it applies to my family.

121
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,760
All right, all right.

122
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,600
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

123
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,680
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

124
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,520
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

125
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Don't you contact me again, ever.

126
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,600
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

127
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,920
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

128
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,280
My offer is this:

129
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,920
Nothing.

130
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,960
Not even the fee for the gaming licence,
which I would like you to put up.

131
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,320
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

132
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,480
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

133
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,600
- Honey, we have to go.
- Really? I'm sorry.

134
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,960
- It's been delightful.
- It was our pleasure.

135
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,600
It was wonderful talking to you.

136
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,200
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

137
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,360
Frank Pentangeli! I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

138
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,960
I've got to check on my boys.

139
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,920
- What's with the food here?
- What's the matter?

140
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,680
"A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says ""canapés""."

141
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,840
"I said, ""Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"""

142
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,800
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

143
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

144
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,920
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

145
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,760
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

146
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,880
No, that was no heart attack.

147
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,640
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

148
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

149
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,160
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

150
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,680
- You can't get in to see Mike?
- He's got me waiting in a lobby!

151
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,840
- Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

152
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,240
- Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
- I remember Tom from the old days.

153
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,880
Rocco...

154
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,960
- What's this?
- It's an orange from Miami.

155
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,600
Take care of Johnny's men. They look
like they might be hungry. Johnny?

156
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,960
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

157
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,600
Sure, Mike.

158
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,960
- What are you drinking, Johnny?
- Anisette.

159
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,880
- If you need anything, I'll be outside.
- Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

160
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,800
- I just left Mr Roth in Miami.
- How is his health?

161
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,440
It's not good.

162
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,440
Can I do anything or send anything?

163
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,280
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

164
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,880
That casino...

165
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,360
Registered owners: Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

166
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,240
The real owners are the old Lakeville
Road group and our friend in Miami.

167
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,360
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

168
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,480
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

169
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,400
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

170
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,080
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

171
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,160
One by one, our old friends are gone.

172
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,560
Death - natural or not,

173
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,400
prison, deported...

174
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

175
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,040
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

176
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,800
Let's have a tarantella!

177
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,200
You! Up, up, up!

178
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,680
Questa mano!

179
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,720
Questa mano!

180
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
What the hell have we here?

181
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,880
- I'll see my sister alone.
- It concerns me too. May I stay?

182
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,360
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

183
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,560
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink?

184
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,760
Al, please get him a drink!

185
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,520
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on the Queen.

186
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,280
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

187
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,560
We're getting married first.

188
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

189
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,800
You see your children on weekends.

190
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,640
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

191
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,920
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

192
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,440
- You're not my father!
- So why come to me?

193
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,000
I need money.

194
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,240
Connie, Connie, Connie...

195
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,000
I want to be reasonable with you.

196
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,600
Why don't you stay with the family?

197
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,560
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

198
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,240
You won't be deprived of anything.

199
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,400
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

200
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,760
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him anymore.

201
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,200
He'll understand, believe me.

202
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,920
Connie.

203
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,800
If you don't listen to me,
and marry this man...

204
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,240
...you'll disappoint me.

205
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,520
- Famiglia!
- Cent' anni!

206
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,120
"What's ""Chen dannay""?"

207
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,040
Cent' anni. It means 100 years.

208
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,280
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

209
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
- It would be true if my father were alive.
- Connie.

210
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,760
Hey...

211
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,440
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law
Deanna.

212
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,360
- Fredo's wife.
- My pleasure.

213
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,520
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

214
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,640
I know, I know.

215
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,480
- I just want to dance!
- You're falling all over the floor.

216
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,240
You're just jealous
because he's a real man!

217
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,920
- I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
- You couldn't belt your mama!

218
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,720
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

219
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,640
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

220
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,520
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop.

221
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,920
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

222
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,680
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

223
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,160
Fredo!

224
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,960
- I can't control her, Mikey.
- You're my brother, don't apologise.

225
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,240
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

226
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,320
- You took over and didn't give it to them.
- I welched.

227
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,760
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.

228
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,880
- He hated them more than I do.
- Frankie, they feel cheated.

229
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,040
You're sitting up in the Sierra
Mountains and you're drinking...

230
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
- What's he drinking?
- Champagne.

231
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,480
...Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgement on how I run my family.

232
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,480
Your family's still called Corleone.

233
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,440
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

234
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,400
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

235
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,440
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

236
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,000
...with Hyman Roth!

237
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,280
You're a good old man, and I like you.

238
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,040
You were loyal to my father for years.

239
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,440
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

240
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,360
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

241
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,320
I know. That's why I don't want
them touched.

242
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,000
- Not touched?
- No, I want you to be fair with them.

243
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,000
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

244
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,680
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

245
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,680
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighbourhoods!

246
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,680
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!

247
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,520
And they leave the gambling to last.

248
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I want to run my family without you on
my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

249
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,600
- No.
- Morte.

250
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,400
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

251
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,200
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

252
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,160
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

253
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,960
Your father did business with Hyman
Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

254
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,720
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

255
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,480
or his Sicilian messenger boy
Johnny Ola.

256
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,120
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

257
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,920
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

258
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,080
Don Corleone.

259
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,440
Cicci, the door...

260
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,880
You want him to leave now?

261
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,640
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

262
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,080
The old man had too much wine.

263
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,400
It's late.

264
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,720
How's the baby?

265
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,880
- Sleeping inside me.
- Does it feel like a boy?

266
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Yes, it does, Michael.

267
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,080
Kay?

268
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,240
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

269
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,640
It couldn't be helped, though.

270
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,480
It made me think of what you
once told me.

271
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,880
In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate.

272
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,880
That was seven years ago.

273
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,920
I know. I'm trying, darling.

274
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,440
Did you see this?

275
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,480
Why are the drapes open?

276
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Kay, are you all right?

277
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,000
- Are you hit?
- No.

278
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,880
It's all right.

279
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,080
Stop! Stop!

280
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,360
Halt!

281
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,040
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

282
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,200
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

283
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,360
Alive!

284
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,760
Stay by the door.

285
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Yeah, come in.

286
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,400
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

287
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,160
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

288
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,120
And I know that's upset you in the past.

289
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,200
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

290
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,120
But it's because I admire you
and love you,

291
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,000
that I kept things secret from you.

292
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,280
Now you're the only one I can trust.

293
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,720
Fredo?

294
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,400
Well, he's got a good heart.

295
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,000
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

296
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,880
Tom, you're my brother.

297
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,120
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

298
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,640
I know that.

299
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,320
You're going to take over.

300
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,680
You're going to be the Don.

301
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,680
If what I think has happened, has
happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

302
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,360
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

303
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,520
I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife
and my children, the future of this family.

304
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
- If we catch them, will we find out...?
- We won't catch them.

305
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,760
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

306
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,320
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

307
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,840
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

308
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,320
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

309
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,920
See... All our people are businessmen.

310
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,400
Their loyalty is based on that.

311
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,000
One thing I learned from Pop...

312
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,440
...was to try to think
as people around you think.

313
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,880
On that basis, anything is possible.

314
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,920
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

315
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,080
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

316
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,360
Over here! There's two of them.

317
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,000
Looks like they were hired out of
New York. I don't recognise them.

318
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,000
Won't get anything out of them now.

319
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Fish them out.

320
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,800
Get rid of the bodies.

321
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,800
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

322
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,640
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

323
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,480
- Did you like your party?
- I got lots of presents.

324
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,840
I know. Did you like them?

325
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,160
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

326
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,360
Well, they were friends.

327
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,360
- Did you see my present for you?
- It was on my pillow.

328
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

329
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,760
- Will you take me?
- No, I can't, Anthony.

330
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,560
- Why do you have to go?
- I have to do business.

331
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,200
I could help you.

332
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,400
I know. Some day you will.

333
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,720
Get some sleep.

334
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,760
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

335
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,240
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

336
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,400
I left Naples. I left Mama.

337
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,400
For a no-good tramp!

338
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,360
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

339
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,720
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

340
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,520
Without news from home.

341
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,280
Finally, a letter from Naples!

342
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,360
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

343
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,840
She's very beautiful.

344
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,080
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

345
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,320
Our dear mother -

346
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,280
...is dead!

347
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,440
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

348
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,600
Sit down, you bum!

349
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,120
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

350
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,200
We'll go see her backstage.

351
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
Who was that?

352
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,640
The Black Hand.

353
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,160
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

354
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,880
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

355
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,520
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

356
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,040
You'll pay me today!

357
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,640
Let's go.

358
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,760
Not my daughter! Let her go!

359
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,400
Here, take all my money!

360
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,080
Vito, come on.

361
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,920
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

362
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,760
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

363
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,800
Even my father, in the grocery store.

364
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,960
If he's Italian...

365
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,560
...why does he bother other Italians?

366
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,400
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

367
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,160
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

368
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,800
If you're happy, I'm happy.

369
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,600
Don't you feel well?

370
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,360
Is your boss treating you all right?

371
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,720
Forget it.

372
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,320
Hey, you speak Italian?

373
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,560
Hide this for me!

374
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,000
Next week I'll come and get it!

375
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,560
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

376
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,400
How's business?

377
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,120
It's good, it's good.

378
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,520
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

379
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,400
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

380
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,560
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

381
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,800
So Fanucci's changing?

382
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,640
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

383
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,840
Even from my father.

384
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,440
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

385
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,800
I've got some bad news.

386
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,000
I feel rotten about telling you this...

387
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,200
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

388
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,680
And you have to give him my job.

389
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,480
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

390
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,960
You looked after me like a father.

391
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,760
I thank you.

392
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,560
And I won't forget it.

393
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,600
Vito!

394
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,280
Oh, no!

395
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,000
Take this to your family.

396
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,120
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

397
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,400
What a nice pear!

398
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,640
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

399
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,240
Did you look inside?

400
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,200
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

401
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,400
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

402
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,480
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

403
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,280
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

404
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,080
Yeah, sure.

405
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,960
My wife would like it.

406
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,560
The son of a bitch! He isn't home!

407
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,520
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

408
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,680
Well, he won't mind.

409
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,120
This is your friend's place?

410
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,080
This is a real palace.

411
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,040
One of the best.

412
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,560
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

413
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,120
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

414
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,840
Come on in.

415
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,680
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

416
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,480
- Would you like a tuna sandwich?
- No, thank you.

417
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,040
... pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S. C...

418
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,520
- Mr Roth?
- Come in, Michael.

419
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,440
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

420
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,320
It's almost over.

421
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,120
- Do you follow the football game?
- Not for a while I haven't.

422
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,560
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

423
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,480
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

424
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:15,560
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

425
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,480
I heard you had some trouble.

426
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,680
Stupid.

427
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,600
People behaving like that with guns.

428
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,200
The important thing is you're all right.

429
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,360
Good health is the most important thing.

430
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,920
More than success, more than money.

431
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,000
More than power.

432
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,560
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

433
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,560
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

434
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,520
Nobody wants another war.

435
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:16,680
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

436
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,920
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was luckı.

437
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,960
I'll visit him soon.

438
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,720
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

439
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,120
Nothing is more important.

440
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,800
- You're a wise and considerate man.
- And you're a great man, Mr Roth.

441
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,520
- There's much I can learn from you.
- Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

442
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,920
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Come in.

443
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,800
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're going to break your eardrums.

444
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,160
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

445
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,360
You're young, I'm old and sick.

446
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,240
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

447
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,520
It's never been done before.

448
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,480
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

449
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,160
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

450
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,120
He's small potatoes.

451
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,960
What's up?

452
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,320
We got company?

453
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,680
Michael Corleone is here.

454
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,000
He's in your den. You better hurry.

455
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,160
He's been waiting a half hour.

456
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,440
Is something wrong?

457
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,360
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

458
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,280
- I could have prepared something.
- I didn't want you to know.

459
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,600
- You heard what happened?
- I almost died. We were so relieved...

460
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,760
In my home!

461
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,920
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

462
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,040
Where my children come to play.

463
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,600
In my home.

464
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,840
I want you to help me take my revenge.

465
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,520
Michael, anything. What can I do?

466
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,560
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

467
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,120
I don't understand. I don't...

468
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,840
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

469
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:37,800
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

470
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,400
- I know he is.
- So why ask me to lay down to them?

471
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,680
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

472
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,440
I know it was him.

473
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,400
Jesus Christ, Mike.

474
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,720
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

475
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,760
This used to be my father's old study.

476
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,080
It's changed.

477
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,040
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

478
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:27,080
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

479
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,200
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

480
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,680
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

481
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,920
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

482
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,760
"He taught me, ""Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."""

483
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:04,800
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favour,

484
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,280
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

485
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,360
That's what I want him to think.

486
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,720
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

487
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,440
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

488
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,120
- Yeah?
- Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.

489
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,520
- We need some more help.
- Johnny?

490
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,240
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

491
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,120
- Who's that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

492
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,320
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

493
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,720
Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.

494
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,880
- Oh, God.
- Will he come alone?

495
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,040
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

496
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:20,200
Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.

497
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,600
All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.

498
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,760
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me anymore.

499
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,920
- Your brother won't find out we talked.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

500
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,080
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

501
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:57,280
- Frankie, I've got nobody here.
- Wait in the car, Cicc'.

502
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,040
- Frankie.
- That's okay, Cicc'.

503
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,360
- What's this?
- A luckı C note for our new deal.

504
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,640
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

505
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:23,040
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

506
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,680
- You won't regret it.
- I don't like the C note, Rosato.

507
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,480
I take that as an insult.

508
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,560
Michael Corleone says hello!

509
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,560
Close the door!

510
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,880
Your friend the cop...

511
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,400
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

512
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,240
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

513
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,000
What's the matter?

514
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,160
- Is that something on the floor?
- Carmine, not here! Anthony!

515
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,720
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

516
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,040
Freddy, it's good to see you.

517
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,960
- How is he?
- He's okay. He's in the back.

518
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,160
Girls, take a hike.

519
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,320
In this room here.

520
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,280
- I want to talk to him alone first.
- Come on.

521
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,760
I thought I could help you, Senator.

522
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,760
Hagen?

523
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
- Listen, I did not...
- It's all right.

524
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,720
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. You're very luckı.

525
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,960
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

526
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,720
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

527
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,720
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

528
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,040
- And I don't know how it happened.
- You can't remember?

529
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,200
I passed out.

530
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,640
Just a game. Jesus.

531
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,920
Jesus, Jesus!

532
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,560
Jesus God!

533
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,680
God!

534
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,480
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

535
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,360
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

536
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:15,160
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

537
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:20,600
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

538
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,120
- As his guest.
- I do remember that she was laughing.

539
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:32,280
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

540
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,200
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

541
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,840
It'll be as though she never existed.

542
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,040
All that's left is our friendship.

543
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,120
- Yes?
- Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

544
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:07,680
- I'm just going to the market.
- We'll pick up anything you want.

545
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,000
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr Hagen's. He's coming.

546
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,200
I'll speak to him.

547
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,520
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

548
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,680
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

549
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,720
- So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
- No, within the compound will be fine.

550
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,960
- We were going to New England.
- That's off.

551
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,640
- Am I a prisoner?
- That's not how we see it, Kay.

552
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,920
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

553
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,760
Joe.

554
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,360
Cuba, Cuba!

555
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,360
Most respected gentlemen.

556
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,800
Welcome to Havana.

557
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,800
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists...

558
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,320
...for continuing to work with Cuba...

559
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,960
...for the greatest period of prosperity...

560
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,560
...in her entire history.

561
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,120
Mr William Shaw...

562
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,680
...representing
the General Fruit Company.

563
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,280
Messrs Corngold and Dant...

564
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,280
...of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

565
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,880
Mr Petty...

566
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:54,400
...regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

567
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,800
Mr Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

568
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,840
Mr Michael Corleone of Nevada...

569
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:07,360
...representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

570
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:12,120
And my old friend and associate
from Florida...

571
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,400
...Mr Hyman Roth.

572
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,560
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

573
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,160
A solid gold telephone.

574
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,120
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

575
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,720
- Mr President?
- Yes?

576
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:40,440
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

577
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,920
- Of course.
- Heavy stuff.

578
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:47,520
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas...

579
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:59,080
...my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

580
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,520
before the New Year.

581
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,640
I want to put you all at ease.

582
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,800
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

583
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:32,640
He said that they're making an arrest,
and in a few minutes he'll let us through.

584
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,800
Johnny...

585
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,960
It's nothing.

586
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,120
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

587
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,920
Viva Fidel!

588
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,800
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

589
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,680
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

590
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,920
I'm very pleased...

591
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:17,000
...you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

592
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,320
When a man comes to this point
in his life...

593
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,960
...he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

594
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,800
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had...

595
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,520
...and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

596
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,320
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear!

597
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,480
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

598
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:49,160
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana,

599
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,280
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

600
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:57,000
This kind of government knows how to
help business, to encourage it.

601
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:03,720
The hotels here are bigger and swankier
than any of the joints in Vegas.

602
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,400
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government,

603
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:11,640
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis,

604
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,080
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

605
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,680
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed:

606
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,560
Real partnership with a government.

607
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,320
Smaller piece.

608
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:28,880
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

609
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,520
At the time of my retirement, or death,

610
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:38,200
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

611
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,800
But, all of you will share.

612
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,840
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

613
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,000
the Capri to the Corleone family,

614
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,560
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

615
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:57,280
but Eddie Levine will bring in the Pennino
brothers, Dino and Eddie, for a piece

616
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,000
and to handle the casino operations.

617
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,320
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

618
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,080
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

619
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,880
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

620
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,400
- Happy birthday!
- L'chaim!

621
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,440
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

622
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,440
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

623
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,880
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

624
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,720
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

625
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,520
- Those rebels are lunatics.
- Maybe so.

626
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:42,360
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

627
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,120
- What does that tell you?
- They can win.

628
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,840
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

629
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,560
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

630
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,320
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

631
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,800
The trucks were owned by your father.

632
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,520
Michael...

633
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,360
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

634
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,840
The two million never got to the island.

635
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,240
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money,

636
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,800
because you worried about the rebels.

637
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,440
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

638
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,480
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

639
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,880
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

640
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:04,080
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

641
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,840
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

642
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,400
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

643
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,920
90 miles. It's nothing.

644
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:22,440
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

645
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,760
and having the cash
to make it possible.

646
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,400
Michael...

647
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,800
...we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

648
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,880
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

649
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,720
- Hi! Freddie Corleone.
- Mio frati.

650
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,200
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

651
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,760
"I thought, ""What if somebody knows
what I've got in here""."

652
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,240
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

653
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,560
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

654
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,480
You want to count it?

655
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,360
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

656
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,840
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

657
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,400
That's great! Havana's great.

658
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,240
It's my kind of town.

659
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:53,040
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

660
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,000
No. I've never met them.

661
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,320
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

662
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,240
...kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

663
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,960
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

664
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:21,200
I know a place where we
can spend some time together.

665
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:27,800
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

666
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,360
Have kids. Have a family.

667
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,520
For once in my life, be more like...

668
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,120
...Pop.

669
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,600
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

670
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,840
"Mama used to say,
""You don't belong to me."""

671
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,320
You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies.

672
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,160
Sometimes I think it's true.

673
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,800
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

674
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,280
Mikey... I was mad at you.

675
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:13,080
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

676
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,720
- You want a drink, right?
- Waiter!

677
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,760
Por favor...

678
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,840
- How do you say Banana Daquiri?
- Banana Daquiri.

679
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,280
- That's it?
- That's it.

680
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,120
Uno Banana Daquiri...

681
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,560
...and a club soda.

682
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:46,080
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow with some government people.

683
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,760
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

684
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,360
- That's my speciality, right?
- Can I trust you with something?

685
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,400
Of course, Mike.

686
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:05,880
Later in the evening we're all invited to
the President to bring in the New Year.

687
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:11,760
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car - alone.

688
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,400
For my protection.

689
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,680
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

690
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,360
- Who?
- Roth.

691
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,040
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

692
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,440
It was Roth all along.

693
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,440
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

694
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,480
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

695
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:07,520
- How can I help?
- Just go along, as if you know nothing.

696
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,480
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

697
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,120
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

698
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:34,280
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

699
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:39,160
Fly in my own doctor from Miami. I don't
trust a doctor who can't speak English.

700
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,640
- Gracias, señor.
- Buenas noches.

701
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,680
- Honey, go to the casino.
- If you're feeling better.

702
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,920
Feel fine.

703
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,720
- Play the bingo game.
- Okay. Nice to see you, Mr Paul.

704
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:03,360
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

705
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:12,080
- You're pulling out?
- Just want to... Just want to wait.

706
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,880
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

707
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,520
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

708
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:28,600
- Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
- The Rosato brothers.

709
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,320
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

710
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,000
I know I didn't.

711
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,720
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

712
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:52,760
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

713
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,840
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

714
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:02,440
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

715
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,600
Made a fortune. Your father too.

716
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:12,880
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

717
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:21,120
Later on he had an idea to build a city

718
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:24,920
out of a desert stop-over
for G.I. s going to the West Coast.

719
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,320
That kid's name was Moe Greene

720
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:34,000
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

721
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,520
This was a great man.

722
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,080
A man of vision and guts.

723
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:46,240
And there isn't even a plaque, signpost
or statue of him in that town.

724
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,520
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

725
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,920
No one knows who gave the order.

726
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,960
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

727
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:04,800
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

728
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,560
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

729
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,200
And I said to myself,

730
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,120
This is the business we've chosen.

731
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,440
I didn't ask...

732
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,960
...who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

733
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:38,440
That two million in a bag in your room...

734
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:44,120
I'm going in to take a nap.

735
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:50,240
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

736
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,400
If it isn't, I know I don't.

737
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:50,160
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

738
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,440
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

739
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:56,400
Senator Payton from Florida...

740
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,600
...Judge DeMalco from New York...

741
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,480
...Senator Ream from Maryland...

742
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,040
...Fred Corngold from UTT.

743
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,880
- That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
- He does?

744
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,280
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

745
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:15,760
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

746
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,680
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas...

747
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,560
- That you got! Con gusto...
- Johnny!

748
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:26,760
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

749
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,360
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

750
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,920
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

751
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,600
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

752
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,600
- Feliz Año Nuevo!
- Happy New Year.

753
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,760
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standing?
- Everybody stands.

754
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:58,280
- It's worth it. You won't believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

755
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,440
- 50 dollars, right?
- You've got a bet, mister.

756
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,680
That's Superman.

757
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,480
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

758
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,600
- I don't believe it!
- It's got to be fake.

759
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,960
It's real. That's why he's called
Superman.

760
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,240
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

761
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:01,560
Johnny Ola brought me here.
I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!

762
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,120
- I see it, but still don't believe it!
- 50 bucks, Pat.

763
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:08,760
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

764
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:14,200
- Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
- I want to see him break a brick!

765
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:36,080
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

766
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,520
...and you'll continue to get those.

767
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:29,800
I don't believe that President Eisenhower
would ever pull out of Cuba,

768
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,520
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

769
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:40,160
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

770
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,840
Fredo! Where are you going?

771
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:46,520
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

772
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,120
What kept Mr Roth?
I understood he was coming.

773
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,680
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

774
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:52,000
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

775
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,840
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

776
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,480
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

777
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,160
Don't make a big thing about it.

778
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,240
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

779
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,400
You broke my heart!

780
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:22,920
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

781
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:27,240
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

782
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:32,360
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

783
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,800
And I shall leave the city immediately.

784
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:42,680
I wish all of you good luck.

785
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:52,440
Salud!

786
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:56,880
Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!

787
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,320
Fredo!

788
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,760
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

789
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,200
Roth is dead.

790
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

791
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:33,520
Fredo!

792
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,840
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

793
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,480
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

794
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,360
Al. Get me a wet towel.

795
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,520
Does Kay know I'm back?

796
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:29,360
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

797
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:32,800
- I took care of it.
- What was it, so I'll know.

798
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,800
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

799
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,240
Thank you, Al.

800
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:46,400
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

801
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,320
Where's my brother?

802
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,600
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

803
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:13,200
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

804
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,960
I asked about Fredo.

805
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:20,120
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

806
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,680
All right.

807
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,400
I want you to get in touch with him.

808
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,520
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

809
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:35,800
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

810
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:40,520
- They can come in now.
- There was something else.

811
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,120
What?

812
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,840
What? Come on.

813
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,280
Kay had a miscarriage.

814
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,640
- Was it a boy?
- At three and a half months...

815
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:14,320
Can't you give me a straight answer?!
Was it a boy?

816
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,400
I really don't know.

817
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,720
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

818
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,200
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

819
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:28,240
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

820
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,960
You know I've got three daughters.

821
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,000
This is my neighborhood.

822
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,760
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

823
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,280
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

824
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:47,360
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

825
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:52,200
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

826
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:57,640
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

827
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:02,040
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

828
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:05,520
And your family will be ruined.

829
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:11,000
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

830
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:15,520
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

831
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,080
Now don't refuse me.

832
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,200
Understand, paesano?

833
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,920
I understand.

834
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:35,800
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

835
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:41,880
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

836
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,360
Don't be afraid to tell them!

837
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:52,320
600 bucks...

838
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,600
Suppose we don't pay?

839
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,240
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

840
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:04,000
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

841
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,440
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.

842
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:09,040
$200 each... everybody agreed?

843
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:14,840
Why do we have to pay him?

844
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:18,240
Vito, leave this to us.

845
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,400
He's one person, we're three.

846
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,360
He's got guns, we've got guns.

847
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,560
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

848
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,400
This is his neighborhood!

849
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:36,360
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

850
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:45,400
They don't pay Fanucci.

851
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:50,640
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

852
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:55,760
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

853
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,760
Now what I say stays in this room.

854
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,960
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

855
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:24,240
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

856
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,520
If Fanucci says $200...

857
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,240
...he means it, Vito!

858
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,640
I'll reason with him.

859
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,840
Leave everything to me.

860
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,400
I'll take care of everything.

861
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,680
I never lie to my friends.

862
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,760
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

863
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:50,640
He'll ask for the money.

864
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:56,560
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

865
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,560
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

866
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:04,320
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

867
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:07,600
How can you get him to take less?

868
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:10,320
That's my business.

869
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:13,840
Just remember that I did you a favor.

870
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,400
Is it a deal?

871
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,760
His family's out of the house.

872
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:12,520
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

873
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:20,360
Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.

874
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:33,880
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

875
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:41,000
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

876
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:17,760
It looks like there's -
$100 under my hat.

877
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,000
I was right.

878
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,160
Only $100...

879
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,320
I'm short of money right now.

880
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:45,600
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

881
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,160
You understand, don't you?

882
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:59,000
You've got balls, young man!

883
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:04,320
How come I never heard
of you before?

884
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:12,560
You've got a lot of guts.

885
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:18,840
I'll find you some work
for good money.

886
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:34,200
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

887
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:39,080
You've done well for yourself.

888
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:44,480
Enjoy the festa!

889
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,840
Oh, this is too violent for me!

890
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,480
What've you got there?

891
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:44,600
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

892
02:03:43,028 --> 02:03:46,588
Mr Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,

893
02:03:46,788 --> 02:03:50,108
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

894
02:03:50,308 --> 02:03:51,828
That's right.

895
02:03:52,588 --> 02:03:56,588
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organisation.

896
02:03:59,428 --> 02:04:03,428
No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.

897
02:04:03,628 --> 02:04:05,988
What was your position?

898
02:04:06,548 --> 02:04:09,508
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

899
02:04:09,708 --> 02:04:12,828
- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator.

900
02:04:13,028 --> 02:04:15,188
No, I don't know. Tell me.

901
02:04:16,628 --> 02:04:21,828
"When the boss says ""push a button"" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?"

902
02:04:22,028 --> 02:04:23,308
Mr Questadt.

903
02:04:24,068 --> 02:04:26,188
You mean you kill people?

904
02:04:26,388 --> 02:04:31,028
You kill people at the...
behest of your superiors.

905
02:04:34,588 --> 02:04:35,988
Yeah, that's right.

906
02:04:36,188 --> 02:04:41,468
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

907
02:04:41,668 --> 02:04:44,428
Yeah, Counsellor. Michael Corleone.

908
02:04:44,628 --> 02:04:48,868
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

909
02:04:49,068 --> 02:04:51,028
No, I never talked to him.

910
02:04:51,228 --> 02:04:54,828
Mr Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?

911
02:04:55,028 --> 02:04:58,188
- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?

912
02:04:58,388 --> 02:05:03,108
I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?

913
02:05:03,748 --> 02:05:08,188
Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.

914
02:05:08,388 --> 02:05:12,628
Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!

915
02:05:13,588 --> 02:05:18,548
You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.

916
02:05:45,588 --> 02:05:47,908
Tell me something, Ma.

917
02:05:51,668 --> 02:05:55,628
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

918
02:06:01,308 --> 02:06:04,028
He was being strong...

919
02:06:06,268 --> 02:06:11,428
Strong for his family.

920
02:06:20,428 --> 02:06:23,348
But by being strong for his family...

921
02:06:24,428 --> 02:06:26,588
...could he...

922
02:06:28,228 --> 02:06:29,548
...lose it?

923
02:06:31,108 --> 02:06:36,788
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

924
02:06:37,948 --> 02:06:41,908
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

925
02:06:42,748 --> 02:06:47,108
No, I meant... lose his family.

926
02:06:48,828 --> 02:06:52,388
But you can never lose your family.

927
02:07:01,268 --> 02:07:03,428
Times are changing.

928
02:07:24,388 --> 02:07:27,708
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

929
02:07:27,908 --> 02:07:30,148
Take it as a gift.

930
02:07:32,628 --> 02:07:36,588
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

931
02:07:51,828 --> 02:07:55,788
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

932
02:07:57,588 --> 02:08:03,188
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

933
02:08:03,388 --> 02:08:05,788
She's in bad trouble.

934
02:08:05,988 --> 02:08:10,708
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

935
02:08:11,428 --> 02:08:13,948
He told her to get rid of the animal.

936
02:08:15,228 --> 02:08:19,668
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

937
02:08:19,868 --> 02:08:23,828
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

938
02:08:24,348 --> 02:08:28,828
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

939
02:08:29,588 --> 02:08:31,668
I'm so ashamed!

940
02:08:31,868 --> 02:08:36,828
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

941
02:08:38,468 --> 02:08:40,508
I'm sorry, but...

942
02:08:42,068 --> 02:08:46,028
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

943
02:08:46,228 --> 02:08:47,748
I can't move!

944
02:08:48,828 --> 02:08:51,068
I want you to talk to him!

945
02:08:51,268 --> 02:08:54,428
Tell him I want to stay here!

946
02:09:00,908 --> 02:09:02,988
What's your landlord's name?

947
02:09:03,188 --> 02:09:05,468
His name is Signor Roberto.

948
02:09:05,708 --> 02:09:07,868
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

949
02:09:08,668 --> 02:09:12,188
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

950
02:09:12,388 --> 02:09:14,828
A real pig-sty, eh?

951
02:09:32,068 --> 02:09:37,028
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

952
02:09:37,228 --> 02:09:40,428
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

953
02:09:40,628 --> 02:09:44,908
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

954
02:09:45,108 --> 02:09:49,148
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

955
02:09:49,348 --> 02:09:53,348
I already rented the place
to another family.

956
02:09:57,948 --> 02:10:02,948
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

957
02:10:03,708 --> 02:10:07,788
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

958
02:10:07,988 --> 02:10:09,748
So let her stay.

959
02:10:09,948 --> 02:10:12,228
Impossible.

960
02:10:12,428 --> 02:10:13,508
Are you Sicilian?

961
02:10:13,708 --> 02:10:15,988
No, I'm Calabrese.

962
02:10:16,188 --> 02:10:19,268
We're practically paesani,
do me this favor.

963
02:10:19,828 --> 02:10:21,788
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

964
02:10:21,988 --> 02:10:25,868
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

965
02:10:26,068 --> 02:10:28,668
How much more a month?

966
02:10:30,028 --> 02:10:32,188
Five bucks.

967
02:10:35,348 --> 02:10:38,108
Here's six months increase in advance.

968
02:10:38,308 --> 02:10:42,228
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

969
02:10:42,428 --> 02:10:45,388
Come see me in another six months.

970
02:10:46,348 --> 02:10:49,788
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

971
02:10:49,988 --> 02:10:51,388
The dog stays.

972
02:10:55,428 --> 02:10:58,948
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

973
02:10:59,148 --> 02:11:04,948
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

974
02:11:05,228 --> 02:11:07,188
Do me this favor.

975
02:11:07,788 --> 02:11:10,028
I won't forget it.

976
02:11:10,668 --> 02:11:14,708
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

977
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:18,988
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

978
02:11:23,668 --> 02:11:26,108
What a character!

979
02:11:33,908 --> 02:11:38,428
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

980
02:11:45,588 --> 02:11:49,548
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

981
02:11:56,228 --> 02:11:59,188
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

982
02:12:00,068 --> 02:12:02,428
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

983
02:12:03,388 --> 02:12:06,988
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

984
02:12:07,188 --> 02:12:11,988
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

985
02:12:16,028 --> 02:12:19,228
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

986
02:12:20,868 --> 02:12:26,348
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!

987
02:12:26,868 --> 02:12:31,428
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

988
02:12:39,708 --> 02:12:41,788
Can I sit down?

989
02:12:44,028 --> 02:12:47,468
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

990
02:12:47,868 --> 02:12:51,348
The rent stays like before!

991
02:13:00,348 --> 02:13:02,308
I'll even lower it.

992
02:13:04,908 --> 02:13:07,508
I'll lower it $5.

993
02:13:10,028 --> 02:13:11,468
I'll lower it $10!

994
02:13:17,348 --> 02:13:19,748
Can I offer you some coffee?

995
02:13:21,988 --> 02:13:26,908
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

996
02:13:31,508 --> 02:13:34,228
You'll have to excuse me for now.

997
02:13:38,908 --> 02:13:41,748
I wish I could stay longer!

998
02:13:46,228 --> 02:13:49,268
Just call me and I'll be here!

999
02:13:59,468 --> 02:14:02,588
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1000
02:14:17,028 --> 02:14:21,988
- Vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

1001
02:14:30,748 --> 02:14:32,068
Would you speak up, please?

1002
02:14:32,268 --> 02:14:33,548
New York City.

1003
02:14:33,748 --> 02:14:37,108
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

1004
02:14:37,308 --> 02:14:40,788
- Where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

1005
02:14:40,988 --> 02:14:46,628
Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?

1006
02:14:47,428 --> 02:14:53,308
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.

1007
02:14:54,148 --> 02:14:58,428
Mr Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness' statement.

1008
02:14:58,628 --> 02:15:03,508
For years many of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.

1009
02:15:03,708 --> 02:15:05,668
I've come to know them well.

1010
02:15:06,148 --> 02:15:10,628
They have honoured me
with their support and their friendship.

1011
02:15:10,828 --> 02:15:15,788
I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are Italian-Americans.

1012
02:15:16,508 --> 02:15:21,308
However, Mr Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings,

1013
02:15:21,508 --> 02:15:26,188
in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

1014
02:15:26,388 --> 02:15:29,348
Before I leave, I do want to say this,

1015
02:15:29,548 --> 02:15:33,508
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever

1016
02:15:33,708 --> 02:15:36,268
a slur upon the great Italian people.

1017
02:15:36,468 --> 02:15:39,468
I can state from my own knowledge
and experience

1018
02:15:39,668 --> 02:15:44,388
that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,

1019
02:15:44,588 --> 02:15:48,708
patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.

1020
02:15:48,908 --> 02:15:53,588
It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples

1021
02:15:53,788 --> 02:15:55,948
to give a bad name to the whole barrel.

1022
02:15:56,148 --> 02:16:01,308
Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi,

1023
02:16:01,508 --> 02:16:03,468
to the present day,

1024
02:16:03,668 --> 02:16:07,748
Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.

1025
02:16:08,228 --> 02:16:13,188
They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.

1026
02:16:19,028 --> 02:16:22,588
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

1027
02:16:22,788 --> 02:16:26,668
Mr Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.

1028
02:16:26,868 --> 02:16:32,828
We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.

1029
02:16:33,028 --> 02:16:37,028
He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.

1030
02:16:37,508 --> 02:16:39,588
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

1031
02:16:39,788 --> 02:16:43,268
He testified that you are personally
responsible

1032
02:16:43,468 --> 02:16:46,708
for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1947,

1033
02:16:46,908 --> 02:16:50,348
and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.

1034
02:16:50,548 --> 02:16:52,908
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.

1035
02:16:53,108 --> 02:16:56,028
Is it true that in the year 1950

1036
02:16:56,228 --> 02:17:01,308
"you devised the murder of the heads
of the ""Five Families"" in New York,"

1037
02:17:01,508 --> 02:17:04,788
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?

1038
02:17:04,988 --> 02:17:08,028
- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr Questadt.

1039
02:17:08,228 --> 02:17:12,708
Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

1040
02:17:13,788 --> 02:17:18,748
No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.

1041
02:17:21,268 --> 02:17:25,308
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

1042
02:17:25,508 --> 02:17:32,268
Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?

1043
02:17:32,468 --> 02:17:33,988
No, I do not.

1044
02:17:34,188 --> 02:17:37,348
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement.

1045
02:17:37,548 --> 02:17:42,868
Mr Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.

1046
02:17:43,068 --> 02:17:48,628
Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.

1047
02:17:48,828 --> 02:17:54,428
He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!

1048
02:17:56,348 --> 02:18:01,068
No, I'll allow Mr Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.

1049
02:18:02,868 --> 02:18:05,828
In the hopes of clearing
my family name,

1050
02:18:06,028 --> 02:18:09,708
to give my children their share
of the American way of life

1051
02:18:09,908 --> 02:18:12,868
without a blemish on their name
and background,

1052
02:18:13,068 --> 02:18:18,028
I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.

1053
02:18:19,148 --> 02:18:24,428
I consider it a great personal dishonour
to have to deny that I am a criminal.

1054
02:18:25,468 --> 02:18:28,668
I wish to have the following noted
for the record:

1055
02:18:28,868 --> 02:18:32,708
That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two

1056
02:18:32,908 --> 02:18:37,868
and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defence of my country.

1057
02:18:38,588 --> 02:18:42,668
That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.

1058
02:18:42,868 --> 02:18:46,668
That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy,

1059
02:18:46,868 --> 02:18:51,308
whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name,

1060
02:18:51,508 --> 02:18:53,708
has ever been made public.

1061
02:18:53,908 --> 02:18:58,868
I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth
Amendment, although I may do so.

1062
02:19:01,628 --> 02:19:06,948
I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me,

1063
02:19:07,148 --> 02:19:12,588
and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name

1064
02:19:12,788 --> 02:19:16,268
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.

1065
02:19:17,708 --> 02:19:22,988
I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly
with your love for our country.

1066
02:19:23,188 --> 02:19:25,788
We'll be in recess until 10 a.m. Monday,

1067
02:19:25,988 --> 02:19:30,508
when we will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges against you.

1068
02:19:30,708 --> 02:19:35,628
At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.

1069
02:19:35,828 --> 02:19:40,108
I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Adjourned!

1070
02:19:43,708 --> 02:19:50,948
Ten-to-one shot, you said.
He would take the Fifth, and I'd lose.

1071
02:19:51,148 --> 02:19:55,588
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1072
02:19:56,628 --> 02:19:59,828
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah.

1073
02:20:00,028 --> 02:20:02,068
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1074
02:20:02,268 --> 02:20:05,708
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1075
02:20:06,428 --> 02:20:09,548
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1076
02:20:09,748 --> 02:20:13,708
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1077
02:20:13,908 --> 02:20:18,868
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1078
02:20:19,668 --> 02:20:23,108
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1079
02:20:24,188 --> 02:20:27,788
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1080
02:20:27,988 --> 02:20:30,948
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1081
02:20:31,148 --> 02:20:35,588
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1082
02:20:35,788 --> 02:20:38,548
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1083
02:20:38,748 --> 02:20:41,388
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1084
02:20:41,588 --> 02:20:43,748
Some deal!

1085
02:20:46,268 --> 02:20:49,948
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1086
02:20:51,668 --> 02:20:56,708
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1087
02:20:57,588 --> 02:21:01,788
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.

1088
02:21:01,988 --> 02:21:04,948
He thought you double-crossed him.

1089
02:21:05,148 --> 02:21:08,348
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared,

1090
02:21:08,548 --> 02:21:11,108
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1091
02:21:11,308 --> 02:21:16,268
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1092
02:21:17,028 --> 02:21:22,468
The FBI has him airtight. He's on
an army base, 24 hour guards.

1093
02:21:22,708 --> 02:21:27,428
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1094
02:21:29,668 --> 02:21:32,548
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1095
02:21:32,748 --> 02:21:36,228
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1096
02:21:36,428 --> 02:21:40,508
Roth, he... played this one beautifully.

1097
02:21:47,548 --> 02:21:50,188
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1098
02:22:27,868 --> 02:22:30,428
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1099
02:22:31,988 --> 02:22:34,348
We have time.

1100
02:22:34,548 --> 02:22:37,508
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1101
02:22:38,828 --> 02:22:41,588
I didn't know all that much.

1102
02:22:41,788 --> 02:22:46,388
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1103
02:22:46,908 --> 02:22:49,588
Anything you can tell me now?

1104
02:22:50,988 --> 02:22:53,508
They've got Pentangeli.

1105
02:23:07,628 --> 02:23:11,148
I didn't know it was going to be
a hit, Mike.

1106
02:23:11,348 --> 02:23:13,508
I swear to God I didn't know.

1107
02:23:16,228 --> 02:23:20,348
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1108
02:23:22,148 --> 02:23:25,028
He said that he wanted to talk.

1109
02:23:26,588 --> 02:23:32,468
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1110
02:23:34,948 --> 02:23:38,948
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1111
02:23:39,148 --> 02:23:42,788
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations,

1112
02:23:42,988 --> 02:23:47,148
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

1113
02:23:48,708 --> 02:23:51,108
...it would be good for the family.

1114
02:23:52,628 --> 02:23:56,908
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1115
02:23:57,108 --> 02:24:00,788
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1116
02:24:00,988 --> 02:24:05,948
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?!

1117
02:24:06,268 --> 02:24:09,828
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1118
02:24:10,028 --> 02:24:14,468
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1119
02:24:14,868 --> 02:24:18,828
Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!

1120
02:24:19,588 --> 02:24:23,788
Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere.

1121
02:24:23,988 --> 02:24:26,708
Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!

1122
02:24:27,028 --> 02:24:29,988
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1123
02:24:30,188 --> 02:24:34,348
- It's the way Pop wanted it.
- It's not the way I wanted it!

1124
02:24:34,548 --> 02:24:39,188
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1125
02:24:39,388 --> 02:24:43,108
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1126
02:24:50,468 --> 02:24:55,428
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1127
02:25:03,148 --> 02:25:08,908
The senate lawyer, Questadt...
He belongs to Roth.

1128
02:25:18,228 --> 02:25:19,868
Fredo...

1129
02:25:22,188 --> 02:25:24,668
...you're nothing to me now.

1130
02:25:26,548 --> 02:25:28,868
Not a brother, not a friend.

1131
02:25:30,628 --> 02:25:33,508
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1132
02:25:34,388 --> 02:25:37,348
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1133
02:25:37,548 --> 02:25:39,988
I don't want you near my house.

1134
02:25:41,908 --> 02:25:46,348
When you see our mother, I want to
know in advance, so I won't be there.

1135
02:25:47,908 --> 02:25:50,188
You understand?

1136
02:25:58,868 --> 02:26:00,708
Mikey.

1137
02:26:07,068 --> 02:26:11,348
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1138
02:26:58,628 --> 02:27:01,948
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1139
02:27:02,148 --> 02:27:06,108
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

1140
02:27:24,668 --> 02:27:27,108
This committee will come to order!

1141
02:27:29,748 --> 02:27:32,428
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

1142
02:27:32,628 --> 02:27:36,148
- Where were you born?
- Pontenegro, it's outside of Palermo.

1143
02:27:36,348 --> 02:27:38,308
Where do you live now?

1144
02:27:38,508 --> 02:27:43,468
I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.

1145
02:27:44,428 --> 02:27:48,708
We have here a witness
that will further testify

1146
02:27:48,908 --> 02:27:54,988
to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.

1147
02:27:55,268 --> 02:28:00,068
This witness has had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

1148
02:28:00,268 --> 02:28:03,028
He can corroborate enough charges

1149
02:28:03,228 --> 02:28:07,668
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.

1150
02:28:07,868 --> 02:28:09,708
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

1151
02:28:10,908 --> 02:28:12,348
Mr Pentangeli...

1152
02:28:13,708 --> 02:28:19,108
Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

1153
02:28:19,308 --> 02:28:23,868
Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,

1154
02:28:24,068 --> 02:28:28,428
and under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?

1155
02:28:34,068 --> 02:28:36,548
I never knew any Godfather.

1156
02:28:39,028 --> 02:28:41,028
I have my own family.

1157
02:28:44,348 --> 02:28:46,748
Mr Pentangeli, you...

1158
02:28:46,948 --> 02:28:50,868
You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.

1159
02:28:51,068 --> 02:28:54,348
I ask you again, sir, here and now
under oath,

1160
02:28:54,548 --> 02:29:00,268
were you at any time a member of a crime
organisation led by Michael Corleone?

1161
02:29:00,988 --> 02:29:03,828
I don't know nothing about that!

1162
02:29:06,748 --> 02:29:10,308
I was in the olive oil business
with his father,

1163
02:29:10,508 --> 02:29:13,028
but that was a long time ago.

1164
02:29:13,868 --> 02:29:17,028
We have a sworn affidavit.

1165
02:29:17,228 --> 02:29:22,868
Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.

1166
02:29:23,068 --> 02:29:27,548
Do you deny this confession, and do
you realise what will happen if you do?

1167
02:29:27,748 --> 02:29:30,748
The FBI guys promised me a deal,

1168
02:29:30,948 --> 02:29:36,388
so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.

1169
02:29:36,588 --> 02:29:40,348
But it was all lies. Everything!

1170
02:29:41,068 --> 02:29:43,188
They kept saying,

1171
02:29:43,388 --> 02:29:48,188
"Michael Corleone did this
and ""Michael Corleone did that""."

1172
02:29:49,508 --> 02:29:53,308
"So I said, ""Yeah, sure. Why not?"""

1173
02:29:53,508 --> 02:29:59,028
Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?

1174
02:29:59,548 --> 02:30:01,628
I can answer that.

1175
02:30:01,828 --> 02:30:04,788
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1176
02:30:04,988 --> 02:30:09,108
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

1177
02:30:09,588 --> 02:30:13,988
- Will he come forward and be sworn?
- He doesn't understand English.

1178
02:30:14,188 --> 02:30:17,708
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1179
02:30:17,908 --> 02:30:21,228
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1180
02:30:21,428 --> 02:30:24,828
- He knows nothing about this?
- To my knowledge, nothing.

1181
02:30:25,068 --> 02:30:29,788
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.

1182
02:30:29,988 --> 02:30:31,988
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

1183
02:30:33,028 --> 02:30:36,508
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1184
02:30:37,068 --> 02:30:40,828
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1185
02:31:07,028 --> 02:31:10,828
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

1186
02:31:11,268 --> 02:31:14,588
The children are outside. We're going.

1187
02:31:15,908 --> 02:31:18,428
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1188
02:31:19,268 --> 02:31:21,548
Rocco?

1189
02:31:22,588 --> 02:31:25,028
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1190
02:31:27,708 --> 02:31:30,668
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1191
02:31:30,868 --> 02:31:34,148
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1192
02:31:37,028 --> 02:31:39,428
I'm very happy for you.

1193
02:31:39,628 --> 02:31:43,908
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1194
02:31:45,348 --> 02:31:49,708
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, I'm not going to stay long.

1195
02:31:49,908 --> 02:31:53,468
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1196
02:31:53,668 --> 02:31:58,468
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1197
02:31:58,668 --> 02:32:01,548
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1198
02:32:02,708 --> 02:32:07,188
"- I wasn't going to say anything...
- What do you mean, ""too late""?"

1199
02:32:12,388 --> 02:32:14,908
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1200
02:32:20,508 --> 02:32:25,468
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

1201
02:32:25,668 --> 02:32:28,468
Where is he now?

1202
02:32:28,668 --> 02:32:31,188
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1203
02:32:31,868 --> 02:32:34,268
All he had to do was show his face.

1204
02:32:35,908 --> 02:32:40,508
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1205
02:32:48,068 --> 02:32:51,788
Don't tell me you're going.
Not you, not the kids. No.

1206
02:32:52,868 --> 02:32:56,668
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1207
02:32:57,948 --> 02:33:01,588
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1208
02:33:01,788 --> 02:33:05,308
Things between men and women
will not change.

1209
02:33:05,508 --> 02:33:09,228
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1210
02:33:09,428 --> 02:33:14,348
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1211
02:33:14,548 --> 02:33:17,588
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

1212
02:33:17,788 --> 02:33:21,508
- Anthony is...
- I don't want to hear about it!

1213
02:33:22,788 --> 02:33:24,748
Over!

1214
02:33:36,308 --> 02:33:40,268
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1215
02:33:40,828 --> 02:33:45,588
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1216
02:33:59,388 --> 02:34:01,348
Kay...

1217
02:34:04,108 --> 02:34:06,148
We're leaving tomorrow.

1218
02:34:06,868 --> 02:34:09,868
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1219
02:34:10,068 --> 02:34:15,628
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

1220
02:34:15,828 --> 02:34:21,908
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1221
02:34:22,708 --> 02:34:27,948
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1222
02:34:28,148 --> 02:34:31,868
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1223
02:34:32,708 --> 02:34:34,948
Don't you know that?

1224
02:34:36,588 --> 02:34:38,348
Kay...

1225
02:34:41,148 --> 02:34:45,548
In time, you'll feel differently.

1226
02:34:47,108 --> 02:34:49,868
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1227
02:34:51,868 --> 02:34:53,748
I know that.

1228
02:34:55,588 --> 02:34:58,828
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1229
02:35:00,628 --> 02:35:02,148
Yes.

1230
02:35:02,868 --> 02:35:05,468
I know what that meant to you.

1231
02:35:07,468 --> 02:35:10,148
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1232
02:35:10,348 --> 02:35:13,068
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1233
02:35:14,308 --> 02:35:16,748
I'm going to change.

1234
02:35:17,708 --> 02:35:21,708
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

1235
02:35:23,668 --> 02:35:26,468
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

1236
02:35:27,308 --> 02:35:31,948
...and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1237
02:35:33,268 --> 02:35:37,228
- We'll go on.
- Oh, Michael!

1238
02:35:38,348 --> 02:35:40,588
Michael, you are blind.

1239
02:35:42,468 --> 02:35:44,668
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1240
02:35:46,908 --> 02:35:48,348
It was an abortion.

1241
02:35:50,108 --> 02:35:55,068
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1242
02:35:55,548 --> 02:35:58,828
Something that's unholy and evil!

1243
02:36:00,548 --> 02:36:03,388
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1244
02:36:03,588 --> 02:36:07,868
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1245
02:36:09,468 --> 02:36:11,668
It was an abortion, Michael.

1246
02:36:11,908 --> 02:36:17,308
It was a son - and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1247
02:36:18,908 --> 02:36:22,748
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1248
02:36:24,028 --> 02:36:29,188
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1249
02:36:29,388 --> 02:36:33,868
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1250
02:36:41,148 --> 02:36:44,308
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1251
02:36:44,508 --> 02:36:48,668
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1252
02:38:14,548 --> 02:38:17,908
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1253
02:40:27,228 --> 02:40:29,948
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1254
02:40:33,188 --> 02:40:36,148
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

1255
02:40:36,348 --> 02:40:39,308
My partner in America, in New York.

1256
02:40:39,508 --> 02:40:41,788
His name is Vito Corleone.

1257
02:40:41,988 --> 02:40:44,628
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1258
02:40:44,828 --> 02:40:46,708
To his company in America.

1259
02:40:51,308 --> 02:40:54,268
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1260
02:41:04,508 --> 02:41:09,788
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1261
02:41:10,508 --> 02:41:13,268
Where is this young man
from New York?

1262
02:41:16,308 --> 02:41:19,748
Have him come closer.

1263
02:41:20,028 --> 02:41:23,468
I can't see him so good.

1264
02:41:29,588 --> 02:41:33,708
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1265
02:41:35,588 --> 02:41:37,628
Bless you!

1266
02:41:39,348 --> 02:41:40,868
What's your name?

1267
02:41:45,788 --> 02:41:49,028
You took the name of this town!

1268
02:41:49,228 --> 02:41:51,028
And what's your father's name?

1269
02:41:51,228 --> 02:41:54,748
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

1270
02:41:54,948 --> 02:41:58,828
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1271
02:42:01,788 --> 02:42:05,028
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1272
02:42:05,228 --> 02:42:07,908
...and this is for you!

1273
02:43:26,148 --> 02:43:28,628
Michael, say goodbye.

1274
02:44:29,388 --> 02:44:31,548
Hi, Al.

1275
02:44:42,228 --> 02:44:45,068
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1276
02:44:52,708 --> 02:44:55,388
Tom, where's Mike?

1277
02:44:55,588 --> 02:44:58,348
Waiting for you to leave.

1278
02:44:59,868 --> 02:45:04,188
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1279
02:45:04,788 --> 02:45:07,908
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1280
02:45:20,508 --> 02:45:22,788
Michael, it's Connie.

1281
02:45:43,388 --> 02:45:45,228
Michael...

1282
02:45:47,748 --> 02:45:52,508
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1283
02:45:59,148 --> 02:46:01,628
Is Kay coming?

1284
02:46:04,108 --> 02:46:05,668
No.

1285
02:46:12,788 --> 02:46:15,828
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1286
02:46:16,028 --> 02:46:19,788
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1287
02:46:23,108 --> 02:46:24,868
That's right.

1288
02:46:27,628 --> 02:46:30,828
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1289
02:46:34,508 --> 02:46:36,748
Please, I want to talk to you.

1290
02:46:47,628 --> 02:46:51,468
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1291
02:46:51,908 --> 02:46:56,988
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know...

1292
02:47:00,148 --> 02:47:02,108
...that I could hurt you.

1293
02:47:08,028 --> 02:47:12,188
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1294
02:47:12,988 --> 02:47:15,308
And I forgive you.

1295
02:47:19,068 --> 02:47:21,748
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1296
02:47:21,948 --> 02:47:26,348
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1297
02:47:32,428 --> 02:47:36,068
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1298
02:47:45,748 --> 02:47:47,708
Connie...

1299
02:49:25,108 --> 02:49:27,548
Tom, sit down.

1300
02:49:38,868 --> 02:49:43,548
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1301
02:49:43,748 --> 02:49:48,188
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in Israel.

1302
02:49:48,748 --> 02:49:53,148
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1303
02:49:53,348 --> 02:49:56,788
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1304
02:49:56,988 --> 02:49:59,588
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1305
02:49:59,788 --> 02:50:04,268
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1306
02:50:04,468 --> 02:50:08,268
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

1307
02:50:08,628 --> 02:50:13,068
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1308
02:50:13,268 --> 02:50:17,748
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1309
02:50:17,948 --> 02:50:20,788
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1310
02:50:20,988 --> 02:50:24,948
- That plane goes to Miami.
- That's right. That's where I want it met.

1311
02:50:26,068 --> 02:50:31,188
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1312
02:50:31,388 --> 02:50:34,348
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1313
02:50:34,548 --> 02:50:40,108
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you surprise me.

1314
02:50:43,028 --> 02:50:46,388
If anything in this life is certain...

1315
02:50:46,588 --> 02:50:49,708
...if history has taught us anything...

1316
02:50:49,908 --> 02:50:52,388
...it's that you can kill anyone.

1317
02:50:57,388 --> 02:51:02,068
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

1318
02:51:02,428 --> 02:51:04,508
Good.

1319
02:51:06,428 --> 02:51:09,868
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1320
02:51:13,428 --> 02:51:19,028
I thought you were going to tell me that
you're moving your family to Vegas...

1321
02:51:20,588 --> 02:51:25,228
...and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1322
02:51:26,148 --> 02:51:31,348
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1323
02:51:34,548 --> 02:51:37,188
- Let's do business.
- All right.

1324
02:51:39,428 --> 02:51:43,188
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1325
02:51:43,388 --> 02:51:47,948
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
Are they worth it, are we strong enough?

1326
02:51:48,548 --> 02:51:53,108
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1327
02:51:53,308 --> 02:51:58,388
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1328
02:52:05,708 --> 02:52:08,268
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1329
02:52:10,308 --> 02:52:15,508
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress,

1330
02:52:15,708 --> 02:52:18,668
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1331
02:52:21,668 --> 02:52:26,468
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1332
02:52:30,908 --> 02:52:32,868
So... you're staying?

1333
02:52:34,628 --> 02:52:36,668
Yes, I'm staying.

1334
02:52:39,228 --> 02:52:41,508
What do you want me to do?

1335
02:52:41,708 --> 02:52:43,628
Hey, Anthony...

1336
02:52:44,028 --> 02:52:48,508
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1337
02:52:48,708 --> 02:52:51,068
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1338
02:52:51,268 --> 02:52:53,748
You know, when I was your age...

1339
02:52:54,228 --> 02:53:00,788
...I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1340
02:53:01,948 --> 02:53:05,268
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1341
02:53:06,108 --> 02:53:10,108
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1342
02:53:11,668 --> 02:53:15,268
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1343
02:53:15,468 --> 02:53:18,908
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1344
02:53:21,268 --> 02:53:25,228
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1345
02:53:27,268 --> 02:53:30,908
- Do you want to try it out on the lake?
- Okay.

1346
02:53:31,108 --> 02:53:32,868
What else have you got?

1347
02:53:59,428 --> 02:54:01,868
Everything will be okay.

1348
02:54:02,068 --> 02:54:05,788
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

1349
02:54:05,988 --> 02:54:10,668
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1350
02:54:11,708 --> 02:54:14,748
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1351
02:54:14,948 --> 02:54:19,748
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1352
02:54:19,948 --> 02:54:24,148
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1353
02:54:28,508 --> 02:54:30,308
Tom...

1354
02:54:31,188 --> 02:54:33,628
...what do I do now?

1355
02:54:34,348 --> 02:54:36,228
Frankie...

1356
02:54:40,628 --> 02:54:44,468
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1357
02:54:45,908 --> 02:54:49,188
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1358
02:54:49,388 --> 02:54:52,828
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1359
02:54:55,308 --> 02:55:00,508
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organisation of the families,

1360
02:55:00,708 --> 02:55:05,908
"basing them on the old Roman legions,
with ""regimes"", ""capos"" and ""soldiers""."

1361
02:55:07,348 --> 02:55:11,188
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

1362
02:55:11,948 --> 02:55:15,268
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1363
02:55:15,468 --> 02:55:18,388
We was like the Roman Empire.

1364
02:55:18,588 --> 02:55:21,868
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1365
02:55:24,228 --> 02:55:26,028
Yeah...

1366
02:55:26,228 --> 02:55:28,508
...it was once.

1367
02:55:32,748 --> 02:55:34,868
Frankie...

1368
02:55:44,268 --> 02:55:47,628
When a plot against the Emperor failed...

1369
02:55:48,908 --> 02:55:52,188
...the plotters were always
given a chance...

1370
02:55:54,068 --> 02:55:57,388
...to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1371
02:55:57,588 --> 02:55:59,548
Only the rich guys.

1372
02:55:59,748 --> 02:56:04,508
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1373
02:56:04,708 --> 02:56:09,668
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1374
02:56:10,828 --> 02:56:14,908
And their families were taken care of.

1375
02:56:16,468 --> 02:56:19,708
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1376
02:56:20,348 --> 02:56:21,748
Yeah.

1377
02:56:22,668 --> 02:56:24,628
They went home...

1378
02:56:25,828 --> 02:56:28,628
...and sat in a hot bath...

1379
02:56:28,828 --> 02:56:31,228
...opened up their veins...

1380
02:56:31,428 --> 02:56:33,988
...and bled to death.

1381
02:56:35,148 --> 02:56:39,108
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1382
02:56:44,108 --> 02:56:47,708
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1383
02:56:47,908 --> 02:56:51,028
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1384
02:57:08,508 --> 02:57:11,068
- See you, Tom.
- Addio, Frankie.

1385
02:57:22,148 --> 02:57:25,108
Kay... You have to go.

1386
02:57:26,428 --> 02:57:30,148
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1387
02:57:38,508 --> 02:57:42,108
Anthony... Kiss Mama goodbye.

1388
02:57:44,668 --> 02:57:47,308
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1389
02:57:47,508 --> 02:57:52,348
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony... I love you, Anthony.

1390
02:57:53,468 --> 02:57:55,748
Kay, please.

1391
02:57:58,548 --> 02:58:00,388
All right.

1392
02:58:12,788 --> 02:58:15,028
Mary, come here.

1393
02:58:22,028 --> 02:58:23,708
Anthony...

1394
02:58:23,908 --> 02:58:26,748
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1395
03:00:01,908 --> 03:00:03,868
Easy.

1396
03:00:09,308 --> 03:00:12,228
Anthony! Anthony!

1397
03:00:12,428 --> 03:00:15,348
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

1398
03:00:15,548 --> 03:00:17,988
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1399
03:00:18,188 --> 03:00:20,068
Shit!

1400
03:00:21,708 --> 03:00:24,988
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1401
03:00:26,148 --> 03:00:29,908
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1402
03:00:33,268 --> 03:00:34,788
Hey, Anthony...

1403
03:00:34,988 --> 03:00:39,148
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1404
03:00:42,108 --> 03:00:43,388
Let's go.

1405
03:01:21,948 --> 03:01:25,908
- Mr Roth, I must take you into custody.
- I understand.

1406
03:01:26,108 --> 03:01:29,068
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1407
03:01:29,268 --> 03:01:31,908
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1408
03:01:32,108 --> 03:01:37,028
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1409
03:01:42,868 --> 03:01:46,308
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1410
03:01:54,188 --> 03:01:55,788
Frankie!

1411
03:02:11,068 --> 03:02:13,788
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1412
03:02:13,988 --> 03:02:17,428
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1413
03:02:17,628 --> 03:02:20,988
I came home to vote
in the presidential election,

1414
03:02:21,188 --> 03:02:24,428
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1415
03:02:36,308 --> 03:02:38,588
Jesus Christ.

1416
03:02:39,628 --> 03:02:44,028
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1417
03:02:45,508 --> 03:02:48,548
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1418
03:02:48,748 --> 03:02:51,708
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1419
03:02:52,908 --> 03:02:56,908
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1420
03:03:37,068 --> 03:03:42,028
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1421
03:03:42,868 --> 03:03:45,428
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

1422
03:03:45,628 --> 03:03:50,068
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1423
03:03:50,268 --> 03:03:53,348
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1424
03:03:53,548 --> 03:03:57,828
- Say hello to Carlo. He's good-looking?
- Yes.

1425
03:03:58,028 --> 03:04:01,868
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1426
03:04:02,388 --> 03:04:06,028
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1427
03:04:06,228 --> 03:04:08,348
Hey, Mr Einstein...

1428
03:04:11,588 --> 03:04:13,948
- The cake.
- Sally, get in here!

1429
03:04:14,148 --> 03:04:16,148
- I was scared.
- Come on.

1430
03:04:16,828 --> 03:04:19,988
- Where's your father?
- Christmas shopping.

1431
03:04:20,188 --> 03:04:22,428
Let's see that thing.

1432
03:04:23,788 --> 03:04:25,828
That's nice!

1433
03:04:26,028 --> 03:04:29,708
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1434
03:04:30,788 --> 03:04:33,748
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

1435
03:04:38,588 --> 03:04:41,708
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1436
03:04:41,908 --> 03:04:44,428
He's not ugly...

1437
03:04:49,748 --> 03:04:55,308
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1438
03:04:55,508 --> 03:04:58,988
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1439
03:04:59,188 --> 03:05:01,708
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1440
03:05:01,908 --> 03:05:06,188
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1441
03:05:06,388 --> 03:05:09,828
- 30,000 enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

1442
03:05:10,028 --> 03:05:13,348
- Why are they saps?
- Let's not talk about the war.

1443
03:05:13,548 --> 03:05:15,268
You talk to Carlo.

1444
03:05:17,708 --> 03:05:20,908
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1445
03:05:21,108 --> 03:05:24,468
- That's Pop talking.
- You're right, that's Pop talking!

1446
03:05:24,668 --> 03:05:28,068
- They risk their lives for their country.
- Country isn't your blood.

1447
03:05:28,268 --> 03:05:33,948
- I don't feel that way.
- Then quit college and join the army!

1448
03:05:34,148 --> 03:05:35,548
I did.

1449
03:05:36,908 --> 03:05:39,708
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1450
03:05:41,748 --> 03:05:44,908
- Why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1451
03:05:45,108 --> 03:05:49,148
- Pop managed to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

1452
03:05:49,348 --> 03:05:51,308
I didn't want it.

1453
03:05:53,028 --> 03:05:55,308
Come on! Knock it off!

1454
03:05:55,508 --> 03:05:59,068
- Punk!
- Sonny, sit down.

1455
03:06:01,708 --> 03:06:05,028
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1456
03:06:08,268 --> 03:06:10,868
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1457
03:06:20,428 --> 03:06:22,388
Nice.

1458
03:06:23,828 --> 03:06:25,988
Nice.

1459
03:06:26,188 --> 03:06:29,148
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1460
03:06:29,828 --> 03:06:32,348
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1461
03:06:32,548 --> 03:06:34,588
Don't encourage him!

1462
03:06:34,788 --> 03:06:37,348
Get me a drink. Go on!

1463
03:06:40,988 --> 03:06:44,268
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1464
03:06:44,468 --> 03:06:48,468
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1465
03:06:50,228 --> 03:06:53,868
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1466
03:06:55,148 --> 03:06:58,988
- My future.
- Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1467
03:06:59,188 --> 03:07:04,588
- I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid?

1468
03:07:04,788 --> 03:07:06,588
He's here!

1469
03:07:08,468 --> 03:07:10,308
Come on.

1470
03:07:12,508 --> 03:07:14,348
Stupid!

1471
03:07:30,948 --> 03:07:33,188
Surprise!

1472
03:07:36,188 --> 03:07:41,588
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1473
03:07:41,788 --> 03:07:46,308
That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...
