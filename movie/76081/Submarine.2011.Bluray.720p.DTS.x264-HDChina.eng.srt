00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,633
BOY: <i>Most people</i>
<i>think of themselves as individuals,</i>

2
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:57,304
<i>that there's no-one on the planet like them.</i>

3
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,472
<i>This thought motivates them</i>
<i>to get out of bed,</i>

4
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,056
<i>eat food, and walk around</i>
<i>like nothing's wrong.</i>

5
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>My name is Oliver Tate.</i>

# ALEX TURNER: Stuck On The Puzzle (lntro)

7
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:34,882
# I'm not the kind of fool
who's gonna sit and sing to you

8
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:40,046
# About stars, girl

9
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,759
# But last night I looked up

10
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,940
# Into the dark half of the blue

11
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:51,188
# And they'd gone backwards

12
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:57,699
TEACHER: "What kind of young person am I?"

13
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,912
That's the challenge. We talk about challenges.

14
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:04,039
Well, that's the challenge
I'm giving you this term.

15
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,160
A gauntlet, so to speak.

16
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:09,377
But this gauntlet is also an opportunity.

17
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:12,921
An opportunity for self-discovery.

18
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,967
What do I mean by "self-discovery"?
Mark Pritchard?

19
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,841
- Having a wank, sir?
- (Suppressed laughter)

20
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,424
Discovery of the self.

21
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,886
Who am I?

22
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:27,345
OLIVER:
<i>I find that the only way to get through life</i>

23
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,897
<i>is to picture myself</i>
<i>in an entirely disconnected reality.</i>

24
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,559
<i>I often imagine</i>
<i>how people would react to my death.</i>

25
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:39,105
<i>Mr Dunthorne's quavering voice</i>
<i>as he makes the announcement.</i>

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,789
<i>The shocked faces of my classmates.</i>

27
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:47,244
<i>A playground bedecked with flowers.</i>

28
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:51,123
<i>The empty stillness of a school corridor.</i>

29
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:53,924
<i>Local news analysis.</i>

30
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,301
Oliver Tate was a popular
and much-loved pupil.

31
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:01,342
Many of the people I've spoken to here
referred to him as an example.

32
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,632
He was so funny and so smart.

33
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,436
He's gonna be really missed.
It's so bad. He's so young.

34
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,138
OLIVER: <i>Tear-streaked tributes.</i>

35
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,225
(Sobbing muffles speech)

36
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:15,225
I just wanted to hug him. I just wish I had.

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,573
I wish I could have said goodbye,
but I never said anything to him.

38
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,656
OLIVER: <i>The steady stoicism of my parents.</i>

39
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,240
All the girls liked him.

40
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:27,410
Other boys respected him,
looked up to him, I guess.

41
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,074
<i>Candlelit vigils.</i>

42
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:34,797
We are witnessing incredible,
unprecedented scenes of quiet devotion.

43
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:40,345
Behind me a vigil that's been repeated
all over the country.

44
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:44,765
A testimony to the love felt for Oliver Tate

45
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,893
and the loss felt by his friends...

46
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:52,349
and, frankly, by Wales on the whole.

47
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,398
And, finally, my glorious resurrection.

48
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,025
Don't ask how. Just know
that I'm now more powerful than ever.

49
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,661
OLIVER: Let's get off.

50
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,219
(Whispers) Zoe.

51
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,772
Zoe, this is for you. It's yours.
It has your name on it. Take it.

52
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,689
- It's not mine.
- Please take it.

53
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,819
That note seems fascinating, Oliver Tate.

54
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,318
You know the rules. Stand up and read it out.

55
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:45,410
I can't. It's Zoe's.
She gave it to me and I was gonna...

56
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,410
(Bell rings)

57
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:50,539
Saved by the bell once again, Mr Tate.

58
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,125
All right, take your time.

59
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,786
I know you're all gagging
to get to double Biology but don't rush.

60
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,893
<i>Jordana Bevan's only real flaws</i>
<i>are her sporadic bouts of eczema.</i>

61
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,651
<i>Other than that, she has many qualities.</i>

62
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:23,192
<i>She never speaks about herself.</i>
<i>She could be anything.</i>

63
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,697
<i>Perhaps she's a Fabian.</i>

64
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,743
<i>That would make her a socialist</i>
<i>who advocates gradual change.</i>

65
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,540
<i>She's moderately unpopular, which makes</i>
<i>a romance between us more likely.</i>

66
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:37,287
<i>She's also a girl - to be seen with her</i>
<i>would improve my street cred,</i>

67
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,081
<i>which, though high, could be higher.</i>

68
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,386
<i>Lastly, she's now single,</i>

69
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,468
<i>cos Mark Pritchard cheated on her</i>
<i>with Abby Smuts at the school disco.</i>

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,434
<i>The full extent of the betrayal</i>
<i>is still the subject of speculation.</i>

71
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,562
<i>Chips knows there's</i>
<i>nothing more attractive than a bully.</i>

72
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,355
<i>He also knows that Zoe Preece</i>
<i>is a legitimate target</i>

73
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,443
<i>because she's overweight</i>
<i>and won't accept notes in class.</i>

74
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,777
<i>Essentially, I disapprove of bullying.</i>

75
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,703
<i>Jordana seems to enjoy it in moderation.</i>

76
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,792
<i>I must not let my principles</i>
<i>stand in the way of progress.</i>

77
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,377
<i>I must be willing to adapt.</i>

78
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,843
Keep up, Tubs!

79
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,506
<i>This was the correct decision.</i>

80
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,224
Give it back now!

81
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:37,434
<i>This was a vivid memory of youth that I</i>
<i>would cherish when I was old and frail.</i>

82
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,762
Oh!

83
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,689
Catch. Straight into the hands.

84
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,186
<i>We were working as a team,</i>
<i>testing each other's limits,</i>

85
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:48,021
<i>challenging one another's bourgeois</i>
<i>assumptions of what was acceptable.</i>

86
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,234
ZOE: Oh, grow up! Grow up!

87
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,946
<i>I knew that these events - although</i>
<i>hard to bear at this precise moment -</i>

88
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,581
<i>would help build Zoe Preece's</i>
<i>character in the long term.</i>

89
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,796
Aargh!

90
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,222
(They laugh)

91
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,600
Wanker!

92
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,742
(Mouths)

93
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,987
Honestly, Zoe, it was an accident.

94
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,953
I mean, it was just unlucky
that you were there and that you fell in.

95
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,617
We were playing... sort of like a game.

96
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,292
And you can replace the stuff
that was in your bag.

97
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,841
- I'm not saying it's cheap...
- Fuck off and die!

98
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,007
<i>In many ways, I prefer my own company.</i>

99
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,435
<i>It gives me time to think.</i>

100
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,263
<i>I suppose it's a bit of an affectation,</i>
<i>but I often read the dictionary.</i>

101
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,445
<i>My word for today is "flagitious",</i>
<i>which means wickedly shameful.</i>

102
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,037
<i>I live in a large house with my parents.</i>

103
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,253
<i>They tell me that our area</i>
<i>has breathtaking scenery.</i>

104
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,081
<i>I'm not sure I believe in scenery.</i>

105
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,428
<i>However, the views allow me</i>
<i>to spy on our new neighbours.</i>

106
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,008
<i>I don't know them yet</i>
<i>but they seem like terrible human beings.</i>

107
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,012
Ninjas.

108
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,778
<i>My parents have not had sex</i>
<i>for seven months.</i>

109
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:51,897
<i>I've been monitoring their intimacy</i>
<i>via the dimmer switch in their bedroom.</i>

110
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,149
<i>I know when they've been at it</i>
<i>because the dial will be set to halfway.</i>

111
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:07,371
<i>I wish life could be more like</i>
<i>American soap operas.</i>

112
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,128
<i>Then, whenever things got dramatic,</i>

113
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,959
<i>you could just fade the picture down</i>
<i>and pick things up again later.</i>

114
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:21,634
Can you tell your mother to hurry up?
I'll be waiting in the road.

115
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,394
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,611
Yeah, you look good for your age. For a mum.

117
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,983
Mum's getting the bus.

118
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,404
MAN: So... I inherited it all.

119
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:42,534
Well, er, it's been terrific. Small world, all that.

120
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,575
It's such a lovely area.

121
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,200
This used to be Jill's grandmother's house,
right?

122
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,377
Yes.

123
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,467
The hours we spent up in that room,
listening to records, hatching plans.

124
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,511
Right, yes.
So are you going to be selling up?

125
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,928
Just gonna let things take their own path.

126
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,257
- You have a good day, Lloyd.
- OK, cheers, Graham.

127
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,720
- Give my love to Jill.
- Will do.

128
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,764
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Goodbye.

129
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,401
- You go get 'em, killer.
- I will.

130
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,073
<i>As usual, Dad drops me 800 yards from school.</i>

131
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,407
<i>That way, I can slip in unnoticed, like a torpedo.</i>

132
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,417
Watch your step, motherfucker! Ha-ha

133
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,332
You've got to wake up.
How many times have I told you?

134
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,255
- Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,092
- Griffiths?
- Here, sir.

136
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,630
- Harris?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,303
- Davies?
- Yes, sir.

138
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,090
- Morris?
- Sir.

139
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,635
Preece?

140
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:44,221
Preece? Anyone seen Zoe?

141
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,137
- Tate?
- Yeah, present.

142
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,730
- Pritchard?
- Yes.

143
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,234
Smuts?

144
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,694
Wanker!

145
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,617
<i>Zoe Preece hasn't been in school for a while,</i>

146
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,661
<i>so I've written a pamphlet</i>
<i>on how to break out of the victim cycle.</i>

147
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,581
<i>I've also given her two examples to inspire her.</i>

148
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,707
<i>Firstly, Rhydian Bird,</i>

149
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:16,794
<i>who pulled his trousers down to fart</i>
<i>and followed through,</i>

150
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,548
<i>calling an unhealthy turd onto the tarmac.</i>

151
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:23,843
<i>But instead of looking embarrassed,</i>
<i>he screamed with laughter and pointed.</i>

152
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:26,348
<i>Nobody could tease him about it</i>
<i>cos he was so proud.</i>

153
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,221
How do you even know all men read poems?

154
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:30,686
All men do, unless you're gay. Are you gay?

155
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,306
<i>Secondly, Chips.</i>
<i>He wasn't even considered hot</i>

156
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,776
<i>until the Watkins twins stabbed him</i>
<i>in the back with compasses.</i>

157
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,194
<i>He said nothing, showed no discomfort</i>

158
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,648
<i>as his shirt blossomed with blood poppies.</i>

159
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,117
<i>His stoicism reminded me of the brave men</i>
<i>who died in the First World War.</i>

160
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,329
<i>Chips is an outstanding bully.</i>

161
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:51,492
<i>He once made our Religious Education teacher</i>
<i>cry using only Blu-Tack.</i>

162
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,169
Right, now, now, now.

163
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,918
<i>I don't quite know what I am yet.</i>

164
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,462
<i>I've tried smoking a pipe...</i>

165
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,304
<i>...flipping coins...</i>

166
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,135
<i>listening exclusively to French crooners.</i>

167
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,101
<i>Other times I go to the beach</i>
<i>and stare at the sea.</i>

168
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,062
<i>Someone made a documentary</i>
<i>about a prominent thinker</i>

169
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,183
<i>who struggled with unspeakable loss.</i>

170
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:16,270
<i>I've even had a brief hat phase.</i>
<i>But nothing stuck.</i>

171
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,116
- Gene.
- What?

172
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,705
<i>The most secure route to Zoe is big Gene,</i>

173
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,500
<i>who, over the last few months,</i>
<i>has become her only friend and confidante.</i>

174
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,587
<i>Gene told me that Zoe had moved schools.</i>

175
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,962
<i>She was very unhappy because she was bullied</i>
<i>and one boy even pushed her into a pond.</i>

176
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,969
Oh... I had no idea.

177
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,180
<i>I persuaded her to give Zoe the pamphlet</i>
<i>by saying it was a love letter.</i>

178
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,768
It's a big love letter.

179
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,850
I've got a big heart.

180
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:54,015
<i>Sometimes I wish there was a film crew</i>
<i>following my every move.</i>

181
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:57,269
<i>I imagine the camera craning up</i>
<i>as I walk away.</i>

182
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,110
<i>But, unless things improve,</i>

183
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:03,199
<i>the biopic of my life will only have</i>
<i>the budget for a zoom out.</i>

184
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,165
I feel bad, cutting into his head.

185
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,425
Why? It's just a fucking frog.

186
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,462
It's still a thing, though. It had life.

187
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,589
Where do you think they get the frogs?

188
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,846
I don't know.
Probably a lake or a river nearby.

189
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:31,384
They probably have a guy that does it.
I could find out.

190
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,643
- I don't actually want to know.
- Neither do I.

191
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,440
- I'm just saying. You asked...
- I wonder where Fat is.

192
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:37,682
- Zoe?
- Mm.

193
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:40,819
- She hasn't been in school for a while.
- I hadn't noticed.

194
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,069
I thought you would have.
She leaves a big gap.

195
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,609
She's not on my radar.

196
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,445
- Is it cos we pushed her into the pond?
- I didn't push her.

197
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:50,946
- Think she's weeping herself to death?
- I didn't push her.

198
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,622
Maybe you should write to her.

199
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,538
Maybe you should write her
a pamphlet or something.

200
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,497
What do you think?

201
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,255
<i>What is this?</i>

202
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,542
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

203
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,591
Meet me under the railway bridge after school
and we'll take it from there.

204
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,803
JORDANA:
<i>Bring a Polaroid camera and a diary.</i>

205
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,101
OK?

206
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,684
(Train clatters by overhead)

207
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,455
- Got the camera and the diary?
- Do you have the pamphlet?

208
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,037
Give me the camera.

209
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,123
OK.

210
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,090
Now kneel down.

211
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,510
Please, Jordana... What is this?

212
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,766
Kneel down.

213
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,978
Close your eyes.

214
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,157
(Train clattering)

215
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,458
<i>We kissed until our lips felt swollen.</i>

216
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,588
<i>Her mouth tasted of milk, Polo mints</i>
<i>and Dunhill International.</i>

217
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,852
OK. Now take out the diary
and write today's date.

218
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,150
Write a few paragraphs on how excited
you are to have kissed me.

219
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:54,236
Mention what a dick Mark Pritchard is
and slag off Abby Sluts.

220
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,992
- It's Smuts.
- Let's call her Sluts.

221
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,911
I sit next to her in Geography, so we're mates.

222
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,917
I don't need your life story.

223
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,833
Wow. You look mentally retarded.

224
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,045
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

225
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,673
<i>I had in fact only kissed</i>
<i>one person before - Zoe Preece.</i>

226
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,392
<i>It was after the Cowboys And Indians</i>
<i>school disco.</i>

227
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,603
<i>I told her if we were going to do it,</i>
<i>we had to hide behind the refectory.</i>

228
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,937
<i>Her tongue was blue</i>
<i>from blackcurrant squash.</i>

229
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,857
<i>It smouldered in the cold.</i>

230
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,897
OK, I've done it.

231
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:35,115
Good.

232
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,571
- Can I have the pamphlet now?
- No.

233
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:41,122
- What will you do with the photos?
- Leave them lying around school.

234
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,125
For people to accidentally find.

235
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,664
Oh.

236
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,372
What are you complaining about?

237
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,258
This is conclusive proof
that you might not be gay.

238
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,385
CHILDREN: Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

239
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,513
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

240
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,018
Come on, gay boy, take back
what you said about me!

241
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,270
I take it back. I take it back.

242
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,149
And admit that you're in fact a gaylord.

243
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,231
(Jeering)

244
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,353
No. Do not admit it.

245
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,942
- Do not admit that.
- Shut up, Chips.

246
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,149
Fine. I'm gay. I'm very gay.

247
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,193
(Shouting and laughter)

248
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:18,703
And Jordana's a slut.

249
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,576
- Jordana is a slut.
- No.

250
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,666
Say it. Say it!

251
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,335
No.

252
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,960
Don't be a dick, Mark. Just let him go.

253
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,132
Fine. I'll let him go.

254
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,171
I'll let him go.

255
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,640
If... he admits you're a slut.

256
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,677
- Ooh.
- Just say it, gay boy.

257
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,602
Say it.

258
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,619
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Fucking big gay.

259
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,954
I was completely overbalanced.

260
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:08,166
It was luck. I'm gonna get him for this.
I'll bring him so much pain.

261
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,585
Probably catch him like he caught me,
on the sly.

262
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,793
Blood.

263
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,842
- Are you gonna get up now?
- Yeah. Sorry, yeah.

264
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,272
- You've got scaly hands.
- It's eczema.

265
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,488
<i>Now that we had kissed</i>
<i>for non-blackmail purposes,</i>

266
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,073
<i>I thought it gentlemanly</i>
<i>to escort Jordana home.</i>

267
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:28,623
<i>When there, I asked if</i>

268
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,661
I'll think about it.

269
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,206
<i>But what she meant was, yes.</i>

270
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,917
<i>We are now as one.</i>

271

<i>Whenever I'm late home from school,</i>

273
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,442
<i>my mother assumes I've been abducted</i>
<i>and left to drown in a lake.</i>

274
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,651
There he is. Oliver?

275
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,819
<i>My mother is worried</i>
<i>that I have mental problems.</i>

276
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,827
<i>I found a book about</i>
<i>teenage paranoid delusions</i>

277
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,580
<i>during a routine search</i>
<i>of my parents' bedroom.</i>

278
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,961
<i>After that, I started slipping choice phrases</i>
<i>into our conversation.</i>

279
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,043
My body has been replaced by a shell.
My organs are made of stone.

280
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,050
- I've been dead for years.
- Right.

281
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,424
<i>My mother is naturally neurotic and in her youth</i>
<i>even dreamed of being an actress.</i>

282

<i>Until she was told by a speech therapist</i>
<i>her tongue was too big for her mouth.</i>

00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,938
<i>Now she works for the council's Legal</i>

(Photocopier whirs)

285
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,895
<i>One of the rules in her office</i>

286
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,069
<i>- is that if it's your birthday...</i>
- Ta-da.

287
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,867
<i>...you are held responsible</i>
<i>for bringing your own cake to work.</i>

- Happy birthday, Jill.
- Thank you.

289
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,866
Oliver?

290
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,325
Oliver, come here.

291
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,918
Come here.

292
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,329
Where are you going, Oliver?

293
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,883
OK, sit up.

294
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,881
- Are you being victimised again?
- No. I'm never victimised.

295
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,095
You were, in primary school and Cubs.

296
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,386
- I don't remember.
- I do. There was a lot of crying.

297
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,348
- Is it drug related?
- How?

298
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,391
- I don't know. You tell me.
- It's not.

299
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,435
- Your pupils are huge.
- It's dark.

300
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,404
- Is it self-harm?
- Why would I punch myself in the eye?

301
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:24,318
- I really don't know.
- I wouldn't. This is stupid.

302
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:27,238
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me the truth.

303
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,739
OK, I got into a fight.

304
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,745
I was defending the honour of my girlfriend.

305
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,371
OK, fine.

306
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,496
You're not being serious, it's fine.

307
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,539
No, I am. I have a girlfriend now.

308
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,583
- Really?
- Yeah.

309
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,177
- Do you?
- Yeah.

310
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,797
- Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,838
Of course.

312
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,345
Yes, of course. I mean, why wouldn't... I didn't...

313
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,429
- Did you think I was...
- No, I didn't. Come here.

314
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,471
(She grunts)

315
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,314
What a lovely little chat. You're doing so well.

316
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,377
So?

317
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,833
K-nock, k-nock, can I come in?

318
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,375
<i>This was the happiest</i>
<i>I'd seen my father for years.</i>

319
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,464
<i>Not too long ago, I discovered</i>
<i>an empty bottle of anti-depressants,</i>

320
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,684
<i>during another routine search</i>
<i>of my parents' bedroom.</i>

321
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,894
<i>My research indicates it all started</i>
<i>when he was sacked from his job</i>

322
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,978
<i>presenting on the Open University.</i>

323
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:40,017
<i>My father is a marine biologist,</i>

324
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,152
<i>and introduced a segment</i>
<i>called Mysteries Of The Deep.</i>

325
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,188
<i>But he was an uneasy screen presence</i>

326
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,813
<i>and never knew quite what to do with his hands.</i>

327
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,948
<i>After his dismissal,</i>
<i>he spent several days in bed,</i>

328
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,367
<i>drinking hot lemon from the same mug</i>
<i>and never washing it,</i>

329
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,493
<i>a key sign of one of his downturns.</i>

330
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,750
<i>Now he works at the local university,</i>

331
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,872
<i>doing a job he finds difficult to explain</i>

332
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,923
<i>to anyone without</i>
<i>a degree-level knowledge of fish.</i>

333
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,380
Listen, I hope you don't mind.

334
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,885
But your mother informs me
that you have a girlfriend.

335
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,390
Is there anything I can help you with there?

336
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,311
I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know.

337
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,064
OK. All right.

338
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,065
Yes. Er... listen...

339
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,601
I know you think I'm very boring, you know.

340
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,657
But once... I ripped my vest off
in front of a woman

341
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,197
and er... it was very effective, actually.

342
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:34,742
I know.

343
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,245
It produced a very atavistic response.

344
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,450
That's just something to bear in mind.

345
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:44,328
And listen, I made you a cassette recording.

346
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:50,505
It's a compilation of songs I used to listen to
during some of my early formative relationships.

347
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,260
Plus a couple of things I thought you might dig.

348
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,759
I think music can make things seem
a bit more real, sometimes,

349
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,721
- if you know what I mean.
- Thanks.

350
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,938
I've also included some break-up songs
towards the end,

351
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,687
just in case things don't work out.

352
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:09,777
Which, obviously, you know, that isn't the aim,
though, I'm gonna tell you, it is likely.

353
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,192
Passion rarely lasts, I'm afraid.

354
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,778
All right, well...

355
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,200
good night and erm... well done!

356
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,085
It's an achievement. It really is, of sorts.

357
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,207
Good night, son.

358
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:43,607
# Tomorrow I'll be quicker

359
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:47,609
# I'll stare into the strobe light flicker

360
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,988
# And afloat I'll stay

361
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:57,617
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

362
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,912
# Tomorrow I'll be faster

363
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:06,746
# I'll catch what I've been chasing after

364
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:10,215
# And have time to play

365
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:16,803
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

366
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:23,813
# And I will play the coconut shy

367
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,942
# And win a prize even if it's rigged

368
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,191
# I won't know when to stop

369
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,398
# And you can leave off my lid

370
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,152
# And I won't even lose my fizz

371
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,785
# I'll be the polka dots type

372
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:48,662
# I'll know the way back if you know the way

373
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,554
# But if you are, I am quite all right

374
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:00,180
# Hiding today

375
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,637
<i>Jordana and I enjoyed a glorious</i>
<i>atavistic fortnight of lovemaking,</i>

376
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,478
<i>humiliating teachers and bullying the weak.</i>

377
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:11,025
<i>I've already turned these moments</i>
<i>into the Super-8 footage of memory.</i>

378

# Tomorrow I'll be stronger

379
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,489
# Running colourful

380
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:26,789
# No longer just in black and white

381
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:33,585
# And quite all right hiding tonight

382
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:40,636
# And I will have a game on the coconut shy

383

# And win a prize even if it's rigged

# I'll be the polka dots type

387

# I'll probably swim through a few lagoons

388
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,118
# I'll have a spring in my step

389
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,086
# And I'll get there soon

390
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,297
# To sing you a happy tune

391
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,377
# Tomorrow

392
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,337
# And you'd better bring a change of clothes

393
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,973
# So we can sail our laughing pianos

394
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:30,770
# Along a beam of light

395
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:40,106
# But I'm quite all right hiding tonight

396
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,912
It's fucking ridiculous! How long's it been?

397
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,167
Two weeks. It's fucking ridiculous!

398
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,333
I'm not bothered. We've as good as done it.

399
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,499
Never take more than a week
between everything but and stuffing it in.

400
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,507
She's taking the piss. Keiron, back me up.

401
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,591
- She's taking the piss, man.
- Thank you.

402
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,630
Watch out, she's looking.

403
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,509
Is she still looking?

404
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,555
Yep.

405
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,475
<i>Jordana hates any place</i>
<i>that could be termed romantic.</i>

406
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:16,310
<i>With this in mind, I took her to</i>
<i>one of my favourite industrial estates,</i>

407
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,355
<i>for some quality one-on-one time.</i>

408
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,990
This is nice, isn't it?

409
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,452
JORDANA: Yeah, it's not bad.

410
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,590
OLIVER:
I mean, you know, we get on pretty well.

411
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,166
JORDANA: Yeah, it's fun.

412
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,751
And we're getting more and more intimate.

413
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,384
Intimate?

414
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,597
Yeah, you know, we've done things.
We've been intimate.

415
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:49,177
We have been intimate, yeah.

416
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,560
My parents are going to the cinema
on Thursday.

417
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:57,896
It's a tradition. They go every Thursday evening.

418
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,938
So what I'm saying is, it's empty.

419
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,820
The house. On Thursday. The house is empty.

420
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,656
On Thursday evening, it's an empty house.

421
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,696
So what do you think?

422
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,664
Are you asking me to come round
and have sex with you?

423
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,994
If I say yes, does that lessen
the chance of you wanting to?

424
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,962
Before I answer that,
I just want to check one thing.

425
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,579
- Yeah, sure. What is it?
- It's quite serious.

426
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:23,631
Of course, yeah. Go ahead, you should
be able to ask what you want to ask.

427
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,881
Will the house be empty?

428
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,721
Write down the reasons why I should.

429
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:47,906
OK.

430
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,040
It's Thursday. You're going to the cinema?
You should leave.

431
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,459
Is that what you wear to lounge around?

432
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,792
Your father doesn't want to go out
all of a sudden.

433
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,043
I've been looking forward to it.
I didn't realise there'd be others.

434
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,630
- They're our neighbours.
- Who, the ninjas?

435
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,383
It's Thursday, our cinema night.
It's not a free-for-all.

436
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,136
Do not call them ninjas, Oliver. It's racist.

437
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:11,465
He's white.

438
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,807
They don't strike me as big Eric Rohmer fans.

439
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:17,140
Why don't the three of you just go and see
some tat at the Odeon?

440
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,065
- I'll just stay in.
- You should both go.

441
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,102
- So rude, Lloyd.
- (Doorbell)

442
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,237
(Rings again)

443
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,690
Oh, for God's sake.

444
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,160
- Oh, Graham.
- Whoa!

445
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,668
- Oh, not really...
- Hey.

446
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,671
- Oh, thanks.
- (Chuckles)

447
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,708
Are you all right?

448
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,921
- Whoargh!
- (Giggles)

449
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,762
You look lovely.

450
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,343
- Thank you very much.
- Sorry I'm a bit early.

451
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:54,174
It's just, there's a fantastic
noodle bar right next to the cinema.

452
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,684
Kim-Lin and I would love to take
you and Lloyd...

453
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,688
- Ninjas.
- My treat.

454
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,354
- Very sweet.
- No need to take two cars, right?

455
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,026
Plenty of room in the van.

456
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,562
Do you mind jumping in the back, here, Lloyd?

457
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:10,743
Hop right in there,
make yourself comfortable.

458
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,280
All right there, buddy? Great.

459
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,866
(Van starts)

460
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,148
(Clock ticking)

461
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,207
(Wind howling)

462
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,026
(Doorbell rings)

463
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,274
Thanks for living up a fucking hill.

464
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,370
Sorry, I had to er... go to the toilet.

465
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,073
I'm OK now. It doesn't matter.

466
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,658
Just gonna top this up quickly.

467
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,496
There we go.

468
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,664
To us, and a wonderful evening of lovemaking.

469
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,007
Can you just get off my shoulders?

470
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,467
I'm just directing you, just...

471
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:01,720
Right, OK, just don't open them.
I'll tell you when. Stay there.

472
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,312
- What, now?
- Yeah.

473
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,445
Fucking hell, you're a serial killer.

474
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,493
I'm sorry for that.
I didn't know whether you'd like it.

475
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:19,362
But we can learn from it. I've learned from it.

476
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:22,700
I think you've learned from it.
Maybe we could start again.

477
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,669
- I've gotta go home.
- OK, cool. You should go home.

478
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:29,924
I'll give you this. It's just a letter
I was gonna give you. Just take it.

479
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:31,960
It's nothing.

480
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,676
- Sorry, but...
- No, no, I... Yeah...

481
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,131
- You...
- OK, bye.

482
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:54,483
<i>Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me</i>
<i>explore your perfect body.</i>

483
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,195
<i>I could drink your blood.</i>

484
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:59,529
You're the only person I would allow
to be shrunk to microscopic size

485
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,952
and swim inside me
in a tiny submersible machine.

486
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,870
We've lost our virginity
but it wasn't like losing anything.

487
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,082
You're too good for me.
You're too good for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver.

488
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,084
Don't get cocky.

489
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,718
(Wind howls)

490
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,309
- (Door slams)
- How was the film?

491
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,236
I'm going to bed.

492
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,948
It's nice to see something lightweight
once in a while,

493
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,567
that you don't have to think about.

494
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,443
Relationships are tough, aren't they?

495
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,736
You should be in bed, Oliver.

496
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:29,367
<i>Tonight, I stumbled across</i>
<i>an encyclopaedia entry on ultrasound.</i>

497
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:33,751
<i>Ultrasound is a sound vibration</i>
<i>too high frequency to be audible.</i>

498
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,670
<i>It was first developed to locate</i>
<i>submerged objects -</i>

499
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,633
<i>submarines, depth charges, Atlantis and such.</i>

500
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,757
<i>Some animals, like bats, dolphins and dogs</i>

501
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,264
<i>can hear within the ultrasonic frequency.</i>

502
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,433
<i>But no human can.</i>

503
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,267
<i>No-one can truly know</i>
<i>what anyone thinks or feels.</i>

504
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,308
<i>What's inside Mum?</i>

505
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,985
<i>What's inside Dad?</i>

506
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,897
<i>What's inside Jordana?</i>

507
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,616
<i>We're all travelling under the radar, undetected.</i>

508
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:04,070
<i>And no-one can do a thing about it.</i>

509
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:07,408
<i>- Any more word from Graham?</i>
<i>- Nothing to report, Jackie.</i>

510
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,662
<i>- We went to the cinema as normal.</i>
<i>- How did that go?</i>

511
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,086
<i>Awkward, of course.</i>

512
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,834
<i>Lloyd sulked</i>
<i>because we watched Crocodile Dundee</i>

513
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,669
<i>rather than one of his dark numbers,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

514
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,718
But I really laughed.
I thought it was very charming.

515
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:24,463
And I could see why someone like her
would go for someone like him.

516
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:28,099
<i>Graham is still very attractive.</i>
<i>He probably felt threatened.</i>

517
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,230
<i>Lloyd is far too self-involved</i>
<i>to feel threatened, Jackie.</i>

518
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,266
<i>He knows Graham was your first love...</i>

519
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,309
<i>- He wasn't my first love.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

520
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,855
<i>- I was 18.</i>
<i>- Pardon?</i>

521
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:39,395
18. Look, I've got to go. I'll call you back.

522
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,524
Actually, I'll see you tomorrow, OK.

523
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,451
(Hangs up)

524
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,535
Lloyd?

525
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,947
Were you listening in to that?

526
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,408
LLOYD: Sorry, what?

527
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,747
I could hear you breathe, Lloyd.

528
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:01,629
<i>Why hadn't my parents told me</i>
<i>that Graham was Mum's first love?</i>

529
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:05,511
<i>No wonder their cinema outing</i>
<i>had ended in such a schism.</i>

530
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:08,428
<i>I can only assume the subject</i>
<i>of wife-swapping was raised</i>

531
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:10,386
<i>and Dad didn't feel emotionally ready.</i>

532
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:13,185
<i>Is it possible that Mum would cheat on Dad?</i>

533
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,393
<i>Will they get divorced?</i>

534
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,188
<i>They don't even row.</i>

535
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,228
<i>They just have discussions.</i>

536
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,658
<i>I'm going to have to increase my surveillance.</i>

537
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:53,721
Good night, Oliver.

538
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:25,253
(Wind howls)

539
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,353
(Grunts enthusiastically)

540
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,941
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

541
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,278
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

542
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:51,990
Yargh!

543
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,374
(Gulls screeching)

544
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,130
Thank you very much, Jeff.

545
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,885
I got you these books.
They're really meaningful to me.

546
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:16,602
This is Shakespeare's most mature work,
miles better than Hamlet.

547
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,473
Just more developed thematically.

548
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:22,355
And this is Nietzsche, one of the most
influential philosophers of modern time.

549
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,522
I don't agree with all he says
but he makes some interesting points.

550
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:29,273
And this is The Catcher In The Rye,
a great modern American novel.

551
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,319
Salinger's very influential.

552
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,947
Why are you doing this?

553
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:36,662
I thought it'd be nice to get some
mutual interest, now we've had sex,

554
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:39,116
other than spitting and setting things on fire.

555
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,162
Why would I want to be more like you?

556
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,501
Just try not to crack the spines or burn them.

557
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:47,048
We should get in. It starts in an hour.
I want to get a good seat.

558
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,552
It's rude to leave a film before it's finished.

559
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:53,391
- Who to?
- The film-makers.

560
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,928
- How do they know?
- They just do.

561
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,720
- How?
- They do.

562
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:00,021
- There wasn't even any sound on it.
- There was never intended to be.

563
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:02,188
- Then why did they write it?
- Kiss me.

564
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,228
(Laughing) Get off me!

565
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,478
- What are you doing?
- Just kiss me.

566
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,154
(Laughing) Get the fuck off me, you freak.

567
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,787
That was fucking ridiculous.

568
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,791
"Kiss me!" Who says that?

569
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,621
- It was a kiss. I tried to be romantic.
- What the fuck?

570
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,243
- You were crushing my face.
- Yeah, in a romantic way.

571
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:25,756
I'm not in the mood.

572
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:30,213
<i>It seems pretty clear</i>
<i>that Mum is having an affair.</i>

573
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:34,178
<i>Why else would she be at the hairdresser's</i>
<i>with Graham the ninja?</i>

574
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,929
<i>He probably makes sure</i>

577

<i>Mum normally just gets a trim</i>

578
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,026
<i>But now I think of it,</i>
<i>she did mention her hair the other day.</i>

579
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,981
I used to have long hair like her.

580
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,398
Hm?

581
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,443
I used to have long hair, remember?

582
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,487
Hm, yes.

583
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,496
Pretty, isn't she?

584
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,620
I dunno.

585
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,659
Do you like my hair long?

586
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,869
- Er...
- Or short like now?

587
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:08,539
Well, you know...
I like your hair no matter how long it is.

588
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,800
But did you prefer it long?

589
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,339
Either way's good.

590
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:13,798
No opinion.

591
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,840
Well, it's up to you.

592
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,560
So it wouldn't bother you if I shaved it all off?

593
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,096
Not if it made you happy.

594
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:22,304
If you want to shave off your hair, you should.

595
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:25,475
Why would I shave my hair off, Lloyd?
What a stupid idea.

596
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,147
Yeah.

597
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,731
<i>I can imagine my mum calmly leaving one day</i>
<i>while Dad helps her pack.</i>

598
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,402

599
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:38,863
No, not really.

600

No, just...

601
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,950
see how it goes, really.

602
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,692
Are you planning on getting dressed today?

603
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:20,735
- Do you want to take the car?
- That's fine.

604
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:24,371
I'm going to work from home today
so if you want to take the car...

605
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:28,670
I was planning on going to see
one of Graham's talks tonight.

606
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,625
- OK.
- You don't mind?

607
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:33,544
- Why would I mind?
- It just means I won't be in tonight.

608
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:36,594
- I'll make sure I keep myself busy.
- Oliver, you coming?

609
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,130
- I'd like a moment with my father.
- Lovely.

610
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:41,175
I'll see you in the car.

611
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:45,556
(Turns tap on)

612
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,099
I think Mum might be having an affair.

613
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,142
Can you turn the tap off, please?

614
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:54,646
I saw her in town with Graham
and heard her on the phone talking about him.

615
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,906
You shouldn't be spying on people.

616
00:42:56,951 --> 00:43:00,366
I just saw them and accidentally
picked up the phone. Aren't you worried?

617
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,867
- Graham's an old friend of Mum's.
- They've met up.

618
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,872
- Yes.
- So you're condoning this affair?

619
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:08,368
There is no affair. He's just some bloke
I stole your mother from.

620
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,827
So you admit they have a history?

621
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,336
I think you should go to your mother now, OK?

622
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:20,548
- Thanks, Mum.
- Just a second, we're early.

623
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,008
How are things with Jordana?

624
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,435
Fine.

625
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:28,392
- You ever going to let us meet her?
- Maybe if you get a terminal illness.

626
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,562
So things are serious between you two?

627
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:34,357
It may seem like a big deal now
but it probably won't matter when you're my age.

628
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:35,187
38?

629
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,564
- Just be careful.
- I always use condoms.

630
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:38,611
Good.

631
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:42,359
You know that your dad and I
are going through a bit of a tough time.

632
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:45,864
And I want you to know
we really appreciate you trying to help.

633
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,786
- I'm not trying to help.
- You're a loud whisperer.

634
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:50,828
You shouldn't spy on people.

635
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,871
Why have you been meeting Graham?

636
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:57,003
Graham is an old friend and has had
relationship problems with Kim-Lin.

637
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,044
He needed someone he could talk to.

638
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:01,800
- So he might be single soon?
- Goodbye, Oliver.

639
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,432
- Mum?
- Yes?

640
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,438
Who would you save first in a fire,

641
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:13,015
given the hypothetical situation
that Dad and I were equally hard to save?

642
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,808
I'd go for you but I'd feel bad for your father.

643
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,153
OK.

644
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,872
- Kiss me!
- What?

645
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:36,289
(Laughs)

646
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:38,667
I still can't believe you fucking said it.

647
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,719
I did not say it in a high-pitched...
like a little mouse.

648
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:43,840
- You cried it.
- Come on, we're late.

649
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,638
- That gap gets smaller every day.
- What are you doing tonight?

650
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,896
I'm busy tonight.

651
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:53,483
Doing what?

652
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,316
As in, I've got stuff to do. Busy.

653
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:58,065
No, you never have anything to do.
What are you doing?

654
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,689
GRAHAM: What is light?

655
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,944
What is light?

656
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:07,615
How important is light?

657
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,247
OK, let's think about that for a minute.

658
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:16,170
Cos it seems very basic and banal but it's not.
It's loaded.

659
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,922
It's a bloody nail bomb.

660
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:23,295
I think light is probably
the most important gift we have

661
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:25,756
from the universe.

662
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:29,093
And if you asked any intelligent bloody writer,

663
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:32,811
like Professor Hawking or anybody of that ilk,

664
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,183
he could talk to you...

665
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:40,684
for about, I don't know, a year...

666
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:43,314
just about bloody light!

667
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:47,110
We don't want to be in the dark,

668
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,452
being fiddled with.

669
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:51,490
That's for sure.

670
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:53,534
<i>How's my dad meant to compete?</i>

671
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,577
<i>The only time I saw him enthral a room</i>

672
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:59,377
<i>was when he gave a talk about</i>
<i>the disappearance of a giant sturgeon.</i>

673
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:02,378
Sturgeons are royal fish, since the 14th century,

674
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:04,883
and, if caught,
they do become property of the Crown.

675
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,765
So, yes, we're treating the matter as suspicious.

676
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,510
How deep is the ocean?

677
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:16,308
Seven miles at its deepest point,
but on average, six miles as a rule of thumb.

678
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:18,434
But no fish could live down there.

679
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:22,401
There's no light, of course,
and the pressure is far too great.

680
00:46:22,448 --> 00:46:25,069
Any human who found themselves at that level,

681
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:27,109
well, they would die immediately.

682
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:30,031
They would implode.
They wouldn't stand a chance.

683
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,072
But in answer to your question,

684
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:34,579
the ocean is six miles deep.

685
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:39,503
I am a prism.

686
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,957
That's not mad.

687
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:45,134
OK? I am a prism, I am light.

688
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:47,838
I am lucid.

689
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:50,804
I am exciting and delicious.

690
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:53,556
Thanks very much for today.
You've been fantastic.

691
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:08,856
Well done.

692
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,783
- It seemed to go pretty well.
- Oh, yes, yes.

693
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,822
I think they...

694
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:16,447
- They loved it.
- Did you enjoy it?

695
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:18,161
Absolutely.

696
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,037
A lot to take in.

697
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:22,498
- But it was silly, right?
- No, no.

698
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,588
- You think I'm silly?
- No, I don't.

699
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:27,208
- It's OK.
- I don't. I don't.

700
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:29,630
I didn't ask for this, Jill.

701
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:33,717
This gift, it's... It's like a burden to me.

702
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,181
Sure.

703
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:37,601
Yeah, you must be exhausted.

704
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,892
I split up with Kim-Lin.

705
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:44,483
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

706
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,439
Let her go.

707
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,862
- She was young, right?
- I'm really sorry.

708
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:51,945
- It's all good.
- Anyway, I'd better... I'd better go.

709
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,034
- Gonna come next week?
- Er...

710
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:56,370
- I can?
- You'd better.

711
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:59,289
Sure. I'll check my diary.

712
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:02,040
- Bring Lloyd.
- Um...

713
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:04,081
OK. I don't think it's really...

714
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,007
...his cup of... I'll ask.

715
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:09,461
If you ask him...

716
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:11,505
he will come.

717
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,135
- I'll see what I can do.
- Right.

718
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:19,438
- Thank you again. You're very good.
- Ciao, Jill.

719
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:21,438
- Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

720
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:24,351
Bye-bye.

721
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:36,238
I'm watching you.

722
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:42,456
<i>And by being in balance</i>
<i>with the colours around them,</i>

723
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:45,246
<i>with a healthy colour glow around themselves,</i>

724
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:47,291
<i>they're living a fulfilled life.</i>

725
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:52,763
<i>So when you're in a crisis, it doesn't</i>
<i>feel like the waves are crashing on you,</i>

726
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:56,554
<i>it feels like you can just stand</i>
<i>under those waves</i>

727
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:59,011
<i>and let them do their business,</i>

728
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:04,269
<i>and then get a towel and bloody dry yourself off,</i>
<i>and go about your day.</i>

729
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:05,728
<i>That's what it means.</i>

730
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:07,653
<i>My mum is the exact type of person</i>

731
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:10,650
<i>who is susceptible to this mystic bullshit.</i>

732
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,572
<i>I can picture her telling Jackie at work</i>

733
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:13,898
<i>how it's a bit over the top</i>

734
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,576
<i>but there's something in it.</i>

735
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:17,613
<i>If my dad radiated a colour,</i>

736
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,703
<i>it'd be ochre or eggshell.</i>

737
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,584
<i>He knows the number for the pothole</i>
<i>helpline off by heart.</i>

738
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:27,046
It's about a foot in diameter.
It's a bit of a concern.

739
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:28,664
(Whispers) Pothole.

740
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:32,051
Yes, that's right, Lloyd Tate.
Oh, hi, how are you?

741
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:35,795
<i>He was the first person in our village</i>
<i>to install double glazing.</i>

742
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,758
It's from Dad.

743
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:42,221
<i>He ruins every Christmas.</i>

744
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:44,264
It's a kettle.

745
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:46,062
Great.

746
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,933
<i>...how extraordinary they are.</i>

747
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:51,355
<i>Because they've forgotten, right?</i>

748
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:55,111
OLIVER: <i>Maybe it's time for Dad</i>
<i>to rip off his vest again.</i>

749
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,945
I mean, it's a bit over the top,
but I think there's something in it.

750
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,788
Yes, yes. Good turnout, was it?

751
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,409
I'm going out for a bit.

752
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:06,416
<i>The question was, do I tell Jordana</i>
<i>about this Graham situation?</i>

753
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,872
<i>I mean, we'd had sex.</i>

754
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,794
<i>Wouldn't it spoil things</i>
<i>if I suddenly got emotional?</i>

755
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:17,633
<i>I decided to soften the blow</i>
<i>with some light arson.</i>

756
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:24,678
You don't talk about your parents much.

757
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:29,192
- I mean, do they get on?
- Yeah, they get on.

758
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:33,364
Mine get on as well. It's good, isn't it?
It's important that they get on.

759
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:36,111
So everything's fine at home,
everything's OK?

760
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,198
Cos everything's fine with me.

761
00:50:38,996 --> 00:50:41,202
Actually, my mum's not well at the moment.

762
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:43,456
They get on, you know.

763
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,077
That's the main thing.

764
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:46,789
Yeah.

765
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,288
Sorry, did you say your mum wasn't well?

766
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:52,623
Yeah.

767
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,877
Why, what's wrong?

768
00:50:56,722 --> 00:50:58,714
She's got...

769
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:02,218
it's called... medulloblastoma.

770
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,224
What does it mean?

771
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,310
It means she's got a brain tumour.

772
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,483
Oh, no.

773

<i>Her mother had cancer.</i>

<i>cancer beats potential infidelity.</i>

782
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:19,964

This is about dipping your wick.
You've done that, game over.

Do you actually pre-prepare these lines?

793
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,452
I just split lines as they come to me.

794
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:55,421
You've got to shut the shit down.
Keiron, get my back.

- With extreme prejudice.
- Thank you.

796
00:52:57,467 --> 00:53:00,800
- Nothing's changed.
- Do what you want. Remember two things:

797
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:02,803
One - treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

798
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:04,840
Two - don't mix family and bush.

799

Get the fuck out of here.
Merry Christmas. Have a good 'un.

You've gotta shut this shit down.

Oh!

00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:16,141
No, of course, I'm sorry. I just...

827
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:18,181
I thought...

Come on.

some silly tumour to kill me.

- No.

870
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:26,150
Part of the family now. Deal?

00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:30,394
Deal, yes?

874
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,487
There we fucking go.

875
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,757
Maybe you should come to the hospital
this Friday.

876
00:57:57,016 --> 00:58:00,100
Mum will have had her operation by then
and we can visit.

877
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:03,977
- If you felt like it.
- Er, Friday.

878
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,106
I've got to do some Christmas shopping.

879
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:08,110
- What?
- I always leave it too late.

880
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:10,560
- I want to get you something good.
- Mother might die.

881
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:11,775
- I know.
- Do you care,

882
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:13,945
- or couldn't you give a fuck?
- I do, clearly.

883
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:15,569
I'll come. When is it?

884
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,361
Friday.

885
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,996
Great, yeah.

886
00:58:20,457 --> 00:58:24,371
Yeah, Friday's good for me, actually.
Yeah, I can do that. Excellent.

887
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,625
Your skin's better. You're allergic to the dog.

888
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:28,629
I'm eating better.

889
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,632
Following Mum's special diet.

890
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:32,714
Is that because of the...

891
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:34,753
We eat lots of ginger now.

892
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,796
So, Friday.

893
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,847
The visiting hours are six till eight.

894
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:40,423
Got it. Six till eight.

895
00:58:40,477 --> 00:58:42,268
I'll meet you there.

896
00:58:42,312 --> 00:58:44,269
OK.

897
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:46,887

898
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:49,610
- I dunno. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

899
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:53,780
- Don't think you have to wait. It's cold.
- No, it's fine. I'll wait.

900
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,566
I've got you these matches.

901
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:57,609
Your favourite.

902
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,368
I noticed the way you light a match.

903
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,367
The flame is the same shape
as a falling tear.

904
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,034
<i>I knew then it was too late to save her.</i>

905
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:09,001
<i>She'd gone gooey in the middle.</i>

906
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:12,630
<i>From now on she'll buy little gifts</i>
<i>for her favourite teachers</i>

907
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:16,008
<i>and she'll admire the scenery</i>
<i>and she'll buy soup for homeless people.</i>

908
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:18,628
<i>And she'll never burn my leg here again.</i>

909
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:24,306
- Maybe I will go. It's pretty cold.
- Yeah.

910
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:26,810
OK.

911
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:37,023
Good night.

It's just a metaphor, Lloyd.

922
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,917
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, it's good, yes.

923
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:36,044
I like the whole colour coding thing.

924
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:39,675
Well, I'd like to go again.

925
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,713
I'd like you to be there, so...

926
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:46,924
- You want us to go?
- Yes, I do.

927
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:49,181
Right.

928
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,354
Do I have to bring shorts?

929
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:55,438
- It's on this Friday, so...
- Right, OK, yeah.

930
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,189
What, are you coming or...

931
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:04,075
Well, I'm intrigued, yeah.

932
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:06,825
- For sure.
- This Friday. This Friday.

933
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:08,035
- This Friday?
- Mm-hm.

934
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,955
OK, yep, yep.

935
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,951
- Thank you.
- Mm.

936
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,420
Don't let me down. OK?

937
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:19,250
<i>The most fantastical way</i>
<i>people experience the Graham Purvis system</i>

938
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:20,677
<i>is to come to the seminar.</i>

939
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,712
Oliver, what are you doing?

940
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,428
<i>...have been mind-blowing.</i>
<i>I've seen lives change.</i>

941
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:28,885
<i>It's just incredible.</i>

942
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:35,183
<i>I wish on a global scale</i>
<i>that people could get the message.</i>

943
01:01:35,652 --> 01:01:38,487
<i>Wouldn't it be just wonderful?</i>

944
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,197
Friday...

945
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:44,817
I'll be OK. I'll be...

946
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:47,739
I'll be fine. I'll be all right.

947
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:49,781
Yeah, I'll be OK.

948
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,658
Yeah.

949
01:01:58,174 --> 01:02:00,166
(Low breathing via a ventilator)

950
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,925
(Volume of breathing increases)

951
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,278
You should go in.

952
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:16,826
(Birdsong)

953
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:26,461
(Wind whistles)

954
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:37,430
Dad, aren't you going to Graham's thing?

955
01:03:37,899 --> 01:03:40,650
- Hm?
- Graham's thing. It's Friday.

956
01:03:40,693 --> 01:03:42,602
I thought you were going out.

957
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,894
Yeah, I'm meant to be at the hospital.

958
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:47,734
Well, you should get along then, I suppose.

959
01:03:47,784 --> 01:03:49,990
Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah, I should go.

960
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,700
Right, I'm off out.

961
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:01,537
I'll see you, then.

962
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:04,424
Bye.

963
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:11,171
Dad, who would you save first in a house fire,

964
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:13,183
given the hypothetical situation

965
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:15,598
that both Mum and I
were equally difficult to save?

966
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:16,925
I'd save your mother first,

967
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:20,644
so we had a better chance
of working together to save you.

968
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:36,864
Do you often feel like this?

969
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,613
Like what?

970
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:41,752
- Tired?
- Down in the dumps.

971
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:45,502
Quite often.

972
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:47,959
How long for?

973
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:51,085
Since I was about your age, I suppose.

974
01:04:51,556 --> 01:04:53,548
What does it feel like?

975
01:04:55,852 --> 01:04:57,844
Like being underwater.

976
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:01,563
Is that why you became a marine biologist?

977
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:03,981
Maybe, yeah.

978
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:06,018
Have you always liked fish?

979
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:08,813
I suppose so.

980
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:13,149
I just sort of drifted into it, really.
No pun intended.

981
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:15,611
And does Mum mind?

982
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:18,495
I think she'd rather I earnt more money.

983
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,950
No, you being underwater.

984
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:22,033
Oh.

985
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:23,745
Yeah, no.

986
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:26,168
I'm sure she'd rather I wasn't.

987
01:05:26,215 --> 01:05:28,836
It's not very pleasant.

988
01:05:29,427 --> 01:05:31,466
The ocean is six miles deep, isn't it?

989
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:35,965
Well remembered. Yeah.

990
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:40,762
(Phone rings)

991
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,056
Could be Mum.

992
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:45,099
Or Jordana.

993
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:47,190
(Phone continues ringing)

994
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:53,983
(Front door shuts)

995
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,412
(Phone rings)

996
01:06:15,223 --> 01:06:17,215
(Ringing tone)

997
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:29,479
<i>I haven't spoken to Jordana about her mother</i>
<i>because there's only two possible outcomes.</i>

998
01:06:29,946 --> 01:06:31,737
<i>Either the operation was a success,</i>

999
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:34,817
<i>in which case she'll be too relieved</i>
<i>to be angry with me for long,</i>

1000
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:36,111
<i>or her mother was dead,</i>

1001
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,077
<i>in which case she needs privacy</i>
<i>and time to grieve.</i>

1002
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:42,956
<i>During this brief hiatus,</i>
<i>I can help save my parents' marriage</i>

1003
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:46,750
<i>and then resume my duties</i>
<i>as the best boyfriend in the world.</i>

1004
01:07:11,696 --> 01:07:13,688
Oliver.

1005
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:15,235
Yes?

1006
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:16,944
- What's this?
- I don't know.

1007
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:18,321
- What is this?
- A letter.

1008
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:20,326
- I don't know what's in it.
- I think you do.

1009
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:22,363
Why did you write this, Oliver?

1010
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,290
This isn't funny.

1011
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,241
If I did write it, and I'm not as yet
admitting that I did,

1012
01:07:27,295 --> 01:07:29,583
it'd be because I spoke to Dad.
This is what he wants.

1013
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:32,334
- You spoke to Dad?
- He knows he's been imperfect.

1014
01:07:32,383 --> 01:07:34,090
What did you talk about, Oliver?

1015
01:07:34,135 --> 01:07:36,127
Listen,

1016
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:38,137
he still finds you attractive.

1017
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,589
He still wants to make love to you.

1018
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:43,214
Are you making this up?

1019
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:46,971
Me and Dad have discussed it.
We both want to make this marriage work.

1020
01:07:47,023 --> 01:07:48,682
Are you with us?

1021
01:07:57,742 --> 01:07:59,734

JILL: <i>Going to the beach with Graham.</i>
<i>I will not be back tonight.</i>

1025

<i>on New Year's Eve,</i>

<i>I'm starting to think that we may grow apart.</i>

<i>I don't want a mystic ninja as a stepdad.</i>

1030
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:24,824
<i>I don't want to be from a broken home</i>
<i>like Chip's,</i>

The celebrations are really kicking in, right?

1036
01:10:31,187 --> 01:10:32,562
Yeah.

1037
01:10:32,605 --> 01:10:34,597
It distresses tiny animals.

1038
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,024
- You can relax, right?
- Mm.

1039
01:10:37,485 --> 01:10:40,058
- There's some lovely massage oils.
- Great. OK.

1040
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:41,570
In you get.

1041
01:10:41,614 --> 01:10:43,606
All right.

1048

<i>This will probably involve me urinating</i>

Fuck.

Do you still have a key?

1076

That's very naughty.

Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

1078
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:54,338
What kind of protest's this, then, eh?

Huh?

(Exhales) Nearly went red there.

1082
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:17,526
Come on, up you get, sweetheart.

1083
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:19,571
I'm just try...

1084
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:25,459
My name is not Kim-Lin.

1085
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:28,542
My name is Oliver Tate.

1086
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,582
(Doorbell rings)

1087
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:35,628
Hello.

1088
01:14:37,182 --> 01:14:39,174
Hello.

1089
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,386
Hello!

1090
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:53,188
LLOYD: Knock, knock.

1091
01:14:54,825 --> 01:14:56,616
How are you feeling?

1092
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:59,069
I saw Mum with Graham at the beach.

1093
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:01,113
Mm. Mum told me everything.

1094
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,822
Did she say she went into the van
with his face on it?

1095
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:05,206
Yes.

1096
01:15:05,252 --> 01:15:07,743
Did she say what happened in the van
with his face on it?

1097
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:08,910
Yes.

1098
01:15:08,964 --> 01:15:10,671
Aren't you angry?

1099
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:12,708
Worse things have happened at sea, OI.

1100
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:15,422
- What did happen?
- That's between your mother and I.

1101
01:15:15,471 --> 01:15:17,547
JILL: Lloyd, I think it best we be honest.

1102
01:15:17,598 --> 01:15:19,008
Sweet pea,

1103
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:21,049
I gave Graham a handjob.

1104
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:25,439
Is there anything you'd like to say about that?

1105
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:28,223
- Lloyd, do you want to add anything?
- No.

1106
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:33,188
OK. Well, I was drunk
and I was trying to relax Graham.

1107
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:35,811
- It was a silly thing to do.
- Mm.

1108
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:37,236
Thank you.

1109
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:39,693
Your father and I have discussed it

1110
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:44,290
and if it's OK with everyone,
that's the last we'll say about it.

1111
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,742
OK? Thank you.

1112
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:50,618
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about now, huh?

1113
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:55,044
Me and Jordana
are having relationship problems.

1114
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:58,002
- Oh.
- It's difficult.

1115
01:15:58,055 --> 01:16:00,546
I suppose it won't matter when I'm 38 but...

1116
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:01,974
I'm upset about it.

1117
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:03,808
You should be more angry with her.

1118
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:05,844
Why would I be angry with Jordana?

1119
01:16:06,438 --> 01:16:07,766
Oh, you mean me.

1120
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:09,891
Yes. No, no. Well, you know, I am.

1121
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:11,934
Yeah, I'm upset.

1122
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,853
We should go back to sleep, though.

1123
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:17,900
Yeah.

1124
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:21,650
We're not going to punish you now
but we're going to talk about what you've done.

1125
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:23,078
What about what you've done?

1126
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:24,615
OK, don't push it, OI.

1127
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:27,998
Well, we'll talk about that too
but you should go back to sleep now, OK?

1128
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:30,450
- OK.
- Mm?

1129
01:16:32,214 --> 01:16:34,206
Right.

1130
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,414
JORDANA: <i>Dear Oliver, I tried to tell you</i>

1131
01:17:09,877 --> 01:17:13,376
<i>but I figure you'll only probably believe me</i>
<i>if it's in writing. It's over.</i>

1132
01:17:13,422 --> 01:17:15,498
I enclose my lighter as a parting gift for you.

1133
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:18,004
Also, I think you should know,
I've found someone else.

1134
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,376
When we're in school together,
try not to look upset.

1135
01:17:20,429 --> 01:17:22,551
I know you're a good actor.

1136
01:17:22,598 --> 01:17:26,844
PS: You were right about
my being allergic to dogs. I got tested.

1137
01:17:26,894 --> 01:17:29,764
Oh, and in case you're interested,
my mum's fine now.

1138
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:32,054
Sorry if it made you feel awkward.

1139
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:41,652
# ALEX TURNER:
It's Hard To Get Around The Wind

1140

# It's like you're trying to get to heaven

1141
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:52,035

# And the doorman says,

# You got a lift between the pitfalls

# But you're looking like you're low on energy

1145
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:10,929
# Did you get out and walk
to ensure you'd miss the quicksand?

1146
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:13,561
Could you tell her I called?

1147
01:18:14,024 --> 01:18:17,274
# Looking for a new place to begin
- It's Oliver. Oliver Tate.

1148
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:19,812
Oh, yeah, she's got my number.

1149
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,028

1157
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:07,070
<i>Just thinking about giraffes makes me angry.</i>

1158
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:10,618
<i>I wish I could hand in this excuse note.</i>

1159
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:12,325
"Dear Mr Davey,

1160
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:15,493
Please may Oliver be excused from class.
His tiny heart is broken.

1161
01:19:15,544 --> 01:19:17,536
Yours sincerely, Lloyd Tate."

- Is he all right?
- He's fine. Just leave him.

<i>In my other recurring dream,</i>
<i>I mentally rehearse the end scene.</i>

1176
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:36,455
<i>The one where it's getting dark</i>
<i>and I mistake a girl for Jordana.</i>

1177
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,833
<i>A girl with the exact same frame</i>
<i>and the exact same hair.</i>

1178
01:20:39,878 --> 01:20:43,081
<i>And when she turns around,</i>
<i>I see her face is nothing like Jordana's.</i>

1179
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:45,372
<i>And she asks, "Do I know you?"</i>

1180
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,251
<i>And I look traumatised and say...</i>

1181
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:49,045
<i>No.</i>

1182
01:20:49,096 --> 01:20:50,887
<i>You don't know me.</i>

1183
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:52,970
<i>You don't know me at all.</i>

1184
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:56,715
I think this will matter when I'm older,
when I'm 38.

1185
01:20:57,187 --> 01:20:58,562
Don't you knock any more?

1186
01:20:58,605 --> 01:20:59,636
Sorry, Oliver. What?

1187
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:02,144
Jordana... I think it will matter when I'm older.

1188
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:03,686
Yeah, course it will.

1189
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:05,774
OK, well... Good night.

1190
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:13,907
# And I can hear you through my window

1191
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:17,621
# But I'm never quite sure who is who

1192
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:23,170

# It always sounds like they're fighting

1194

# Or as if that's what they're about to do

1195
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:33,589
# It might not hurt now

1196
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,008
# But it's gonna hurt soon

1197
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:50,188
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1198
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:54,452

Pritchard.

1200
01:21:55,704 --> 01:21:58,159
Pritchard, take a look at this.
It's as funny as fuck.

1201
01:21:58,206 --> 01:22:00,494
MR DUNTHORNE: All right, whose note is that?

1202
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:08,048
It's mine.

1203
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:12,044
Thank you, Oliver, for your refreshing honesty.

1204
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:14,718
But you know the rules.
Up you come, read it out.

1205
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,673
(Clears throat)

1206
01:23:00,477 --> 01:23:02,268
It was just a joke?

1207
01:23:02,729 --> 01:23:03,927
Yeah.

1208
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,980
OK, well, as I say,
if it was just a joke then that's fine.

1209
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:10,061
But if ever you have serious feelings

1210
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:13,479
of, you know, difficulty

1211
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:14,906
or sadness

1212
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:18,401
or any negative feelings that you want
to talk about, feel free to come and...

1213
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:19,733
I know, I know, yeah.

1214
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:21,198
I can talk to you about that.

1215
01:23:21,248 --> 01:23:22,907
OK. I don't want to embarrass you

1216
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:27,086
but I just wanted you to know that
I'm open to talking whenever you want.

1217
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:28,372
Yeah. OK.

1218
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:29,369
Cool.

1219
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:30,916
Good.

1220
01:23:30,966 --> 01:23:33,457
Nice one, OI. Nice one, you fuck-muppet.

1221
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:36,594
Why write stuff like that?
Perhaps people are right and you are gay.

1222
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:39,804
"Jordana, I love you. I want to
have your babies, get married."

1223
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:41,011
What the fuck?

1224
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:44,807
- Fuck you, Chips.
- What the fuck are you up to, you fool?

1225
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:00,531
What?

1226
01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:02,787
- You're a loser.
- Go and see the girl

1227
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:04,740
- who doesn't like you.
- I'll be back.

1228
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:06,415
I'll hit you in the face.

1229
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:13,380
Can I have a word, please, in private,
without him?

1230
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:15,253
I'm fine here.

1231
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:17,795
Sorry I didn't come to the hospital.

1232
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:20,054
I thought my parents were going to split up

1233
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:22,339
and I didn't want to look weak
or things to change.

1234
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:24,764
(Whispers)
My mum gave a hand-job to a mystic.

1235
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:29,764
Look, I was frightened.

1236
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:32,101
I'm full of regret.

1237
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:41,440
This is the moment where you leave him
and come with me.

1238
01:24:45,874 --> 01:24:47,665
Is it?

1239
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:50,083
Yeah.

1240
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:52,120
Are you coming?

1241
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:56,583
No.

1242
01:25:08,438 --> 01:25:09,896
(Chips laughs)

1243
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:24,611
(Seagulls cry)

1244
01:26:08,248 --> 01:26:11,332
<i>I don't know if I've come of age</i>
<i>but I'm certainly older now.</i>

1245
01:26:11,793 --> 01:26:15,493
<i>I feel shrunken, as if there's</i>
<i>a tiny ancient Oliver Tate inside me</i>

1246
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:18,417
<i>operating the levers of</i>
<i>a life-size Oliver-shaped shell.</i>

1247
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:20,754
<i>A shell on which a decrepit picture show</i>

1248
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:22,794
<i>replays the same handful of images.</i>

1249
01:26:39,404 --> 01:26:43,567
<i>Every night I come to the same place</i>
<i>and wait till the sky catches up with my mood.</i>

1250
01:26:45,285 --> 01:26:46,862
<i>The pattern is set.</i>

1251
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:50,696
<i>This is, no doubt, the end.</i>

1252
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:08,302
Jordana!

1253
01:27:17,275 --> 01:27:18,982
Jordana!

1254
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:24,189
It is you.

1255
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:26,863
I didn't think it'd be you. I...

1256
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:30,903
I thought it'd be like a film
where the girl turns round and it's not the...

1257
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:33,031
You've got a new dog. You're allergic.

1258
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,706
- Oliver.
- Where's your boyfriend?

1259
01:27:34,751 --> 01:27:36,161
He's not my boyfriend.

1260
01:27:36,211 --> 01:27:39,046
Your skin's looking bad, terrible.
It's probably the dog.

1261
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:40,997
I don't care about my fucking skin.

1262
01:27:41,049 --> 01:27:44,252
- Why on earth did you get a new dog?
- Because I like dogs, OK?

1263
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:46,009
Why are you such a total dick?

1264
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:48,046
I don't know.

1265
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:51,302
I was crying earlier. My eyes are probably red.

1266
01:27:51,768 --> 01:27:52,847
They look fine.

1267
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:55,135
No, well, maybe they don't go red when I cry.

1268
01:27:55,188 --> 01:27:57,180
It happens to some.

1269
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:01,310
You were horrible to me.

1270
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:05,979
I know. I made a mistake.

1271
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:08,986
I made a mistake.
What do you want me to say?

1272
01:28:13,623 --> 01:28:15,366
- Ask me how deep the ocean is.
- Shut up.

1273
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:16,995
Go on, just ask me.

1274
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:18,585
- Why?
- Because I know the answer.

1275
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:20,454
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah. I do.

1276
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:22,047
- How deep?
- I'm not going to say.

1277
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:24,082
I'm broken-hearted.

1278
01:28:24,843 --> 01:28:26,919
- The ocean is six miles deep.
- Good.
