1
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,224
I got the Strangler. Wabash and Van Buren.

2
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,654
Oh, shit.

3
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,511
Oh, shit!

4
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:19,305
Jack, get the van.

5
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:21,507
Eddie, help me!

6
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,152
Eddie, Eddie, don't leave me! God, no!

7
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:44,330
Give it up, Ray. It's over.

8
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,164
Oh, God, I'm dying.

9
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,670
You hear this, you son of a bitch?

10
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,591
I'm gonna get you for it!

11
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:22,845
I'm gonna get you,

12
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:28,008
and I'm gonna get Eddie, no matter what!

13
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:43,983
I gotta find somebody.

14
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,277
I gotta find somebody.

15
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,293
I don't know. I gotta find somebody.

16
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,922
Gotta find somebody.

17
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,507
Give me the power, I beg of you!

18
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:27,238
<i>I have no friends. No one will play with me.</i>

19
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:31,575
<i>Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.</i>

20
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,828
<i>Hey, cheer up.</i>

21
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:36,914
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- <i>I'm a Good Guy.</i>

22
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:41,877
<i>I've just come from the Good Guy Clubhouse,
and I'll be your friend to the end.</i>

23
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,256
<i>You will? You mean you'll be my friend now?</i>

24
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,762
<i>Sure, I will.</i>

25
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,476
<i>Hidey-ho.</i>

26
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,721
I saw this one.

27
00:06:55,891 --> 00:07:00,149
<i>Hidey hidey ho
Best friends till the end</i>

28
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:03,444
<i>When you're feeling down or feeling blue</i>

29
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,280
<i>A Good Guy will always be there for you</i>

30
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,822
<i>Because a Good Guy is your true blue friend</i>

31
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:12,366
<i>He's your best friend till the end</i>

32
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:16,787
<i>All right, good guys,
that's our Good Guys show for today,</i>

33
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,247
<i>but don't go away,</i>

34
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,835
<i>because we've got a very important
Good Guy message just for you.</i>

35
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,716
<i>Hi, Good Guys. Boy, have I got news for you.</i>

36
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,344
<i>Now you can have your very own Good Guy doll.</i>

37
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,762
<i>That's right.</i>

38
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:38,434
<i>You can have all the adventures
we have on TV in your very own home.</i>

39
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,812
<i>Good Guys say three different sentences.</i>

40
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:45,653
<i>We even turn our heads
and blink our eyes when you talk to us.</i>

41
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,234
<i>Right, Oscar?</i>

42
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:52,339
<i>Hi, I'm Oscar, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.</i>

43
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,242
Wow!

44
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,666
<i>Every Good Guy has a name all his own,</i>

45
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,415
<i>so he can be your very own best friend.</i>

46
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:05,294
<i>So remember to tell Mom and Dad
you want a Good Guy.</i>

47
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:09,215
<i>Perfect for birthdays or just any old time.</i>

48
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:15,221
<i>And remember, you can buy
all of our Good Guy accessories, too.</i>

49
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:18,318
- <i>Right, Oscar?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

50
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:22,269
<i>Brought to you exclusively by Play Pals,</i>

51
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,980
<i>makers of Good Guys and other fine toys.</i>

52
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:28,567
<i>Found in toy stores
throughout the greater Chicago area.</i>

53
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:34,031
Mommy, wake up.

54
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,327
Mommy.

55
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:43,666
Mommy, wake up.

56
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,089
Mommy, wake up.

57
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,259
- Wake up, Mommy. Wake up.
- Andy.

58
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,559
What time is it, Andy?

59
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,518
- Wake up.
- 6:30. It's only 6:30 in the morning.

60
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:09,817
But it's a beautiful day outside. See?

61
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,446
It certainly is.

62
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:17,158
- How long you been up, birthday boy?
- Since forever.

63
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,744
I made you breakfast in bed.

64
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,496
You did? Oh, God.

65
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:25,291
Well, thanks.

66
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,544
Well, this looks just excellent.

67
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:33,469
I'll tell you what.

68
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,759
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?

69
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,802
Mmm-hmm.

70
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,186
But first, I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.

71
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,894
Come here. Come here. Come here.

72
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,399
That's one.
How many years old are you today? Two.

73
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,822
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

74
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:56,906
Thanks. Can we open my presents now, Mommy?

75
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:59,533
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!

76
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,246
<i>Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour,</i>

77
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,125
<i>Charles Lee Ray, the notorious
Lake Shore Strangler was shot and killed</i>

78
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,507
<i>shortly before 3:00 a.m.
this morning on Wabash Avenue.</i>

79
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:14,844
Can I open this first, Mommy? Can I, can I?

80
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:18,427
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?

81
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,180
Okay, go ahead.

82
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:31,273
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.

83
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,820
I think they're gonna be okay. We'll just
have to take them up just a couple of inches.

84
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:40,825
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

85
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,620
Oh, I know. You want some toys, don't you?

86
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,580
Not boring old clothes.

87
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:49,792
Try the other one.

88
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,885
Well, what do you think?

89
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:59,889
- I want a Good Guy to go with it.
- I know you do, Andy.

90
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:03,055
But I didn't know about it
in time this month to save up for it.

91
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,024
- Karen.
- Hi.

92
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,780
You know that doll that you wanted for Andy?

93
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,653
- The one that costs 100 bucks?
- Yeah, the Good Guy doll.

94
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:20,990
There is a peddler in the alley behind
the store, and I think he's got one.

95
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,370
What? What would a peddler
be doing with a doll?

96
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,994
Who cares? Would you grab your purse
and come on? We can get a deal on it.

97
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:27,458
- But I can't just leave my counter.
- Do you want the damn doll or don't you?

98
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,543
- Of course I do.
- Well, then, come on.

99
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:30,833
- Come on.
- All right.

100
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:35,796
There he is.

101
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,385
Okay, show her.

102
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,932
Well, is it a Good Guy or not?

103
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,143
It is. It is.

104
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,771
- Yeah, well, I told you.
- How much do you want for it?

105
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:52,855
50 bucks.

106
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,398
- 10 and not a penny more.
- 30.

107
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,570
What, are you kidding?
That thing is not worth $30.

108
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,903
Enough. Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

109
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,988
- I'll take it.
- Karen, it's too much money.

110
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,365
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

111
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,201
But we don't even know
if the damn thing works.

112
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:08,207
Here you go, lady.
May it bring you and your kid a lot of joy.

113
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:11,127
- Thank you.
- Hey, hold on, you!

114
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:13,918
How do we know the damn thing isn't stolen?

115
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,754
- Steal this.
- Steal this yourself.

116
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,256
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.

117
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,468
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

118
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,644
Andy's gonna love it!

119
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:31,852
Mrs. Barclay, so nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?

120
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:33,437
I'm sorry, Mr. Criswell.
I was only gone for a minute.

121
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:37,108
Have a heart, Criswell. We were just downstairs
buying her little boy a birthday present.

122
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:40,528
We have specified break times
for activities like that, Miss Peterson.

123
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:43,114
Mrs. Howe has taken sick,
and we're shorthanded tonight.

124
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,782
You'll have to fill in for her.

125
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,288
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care center in an hour.

126
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:50,458
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Wait a second. I'll take over for her.

127
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:54,208
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

128
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,835
You'll just simply have to do it.

129
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:59,338
Now, you can take off at 5:00,
but you'll have to be back at 9:00.

130
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,798
It's my son's birthday.

131
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,801
Mrs. Barclay,
are you happy with your job here?

132
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:04,844
Yes, of course I am.

133
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:09,014
- Then I suggest that...
- Hey. Chill out, would you, Walter?

134
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,476
- I'll take care of Andy for you.
- Maggie, you can't do it again.

135
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,691
Don't be silly.
It'll be the hottest date I've had in months.

136
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,565
I can't imagine why.

137
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:30,411
- Hey, where are you going?
- <i>Good Guys</i> are on TV.

138
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:33,247
Well, I may have something better for you.

139
00:13:33,497 --> 00:13:34,582
What?

140
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,461
This isn't groceries.

141
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,563
A Good Guy! I knew it!

142
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,899
I knew you'd get me one.

143
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,064
Show me how he works, okay?

144
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:03,277
Hi, I'm Andy. What's your name?

145
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,366
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.

146
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:13,287
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

147
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,040
Oh, Mom, thanks.

148

00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:59,333
Hey, Chucky, you're not watching me.

155
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,841
Hey, wanna play?

156
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,593
Hey, it's time for bed, Andy.

157
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:08,596
<i>No, sir. Never saw the little swab before.</i>

158
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:12,388
Come on, Chucky.
We have to get ready to go to bed.

159
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:16,434
<i>I'm not a stowaway. Mr. Ghoo brought me here.</i>

160
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,811
<i>And who might Mr. Apple be?</i>

161
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,945
Aunt Maggie,
Chucky wants to watch the 9:00 news.

162
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,030
Sure he does.

163
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:34,785
Okay, kid, off we go.

164
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,704
Come on. There we go.

165
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:42,084
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.

166
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:45,754
You, too. Off we go.

167
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:52,553
Now, it's brush your teeth
and under the covers with you.

168
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,682
Okay? Agreed?

169
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,310
Good. Okay.

170
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:02,521
You yell when you're ready
for me to tuck you in.

171
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:08,051
Hey, Chucky, want to see my room?

172
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,920
Andy, are you brushing your teeth?

173
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,838
Yes, Aunt Maggie.

174
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:29,840
Good.

175
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:39,433
<i>And now, Action News at 9:00.</i>

176
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,521
<i>In Washington today,</i>

177
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:47,778
<i>the mayor replied that he would study
the congressional findings carefully</i>

178
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:52,199
<i>and have the commission on gang-related
violence issue recommendations to him.</i>

179
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,031
<i>Back to you, Steve.</i>

180
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,037
<i>Thank you, Terry.</i>

181
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:58,456
<i>In other news,
police have now clarified the information</i>

182
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:00,541
<i>regarding the escape of Eddie Caputo.</i>

183
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,918
<i>Authorities say that
Caputo managed to elude his captors</i>

184
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:06,877
<i>while being transferred onto a prison bus
on his way to court. Of course...</i>

185
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:18,059
Okay, mister, what do you have
to say about this?

186
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:20,683
- About what?
- Come on. Come on.

187
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:26,689
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.

188
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,404
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.

189
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,028
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it

190
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,489
when I told you it was time to go to bed.

191
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:38,117
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, no? What did Chucky do?

192
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,412
Walk into the living room
and turn it on all by himself?

193
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,250
Did you do that, Chucky?

194
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,667
Andy, stop it.
Now, come on, under the covers. Hurry.

195
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:51,422
- But, Auntie...
- Under the covers and not another word.

196
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:55,009
But I didn't put Chucky in front of the TV.

197
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,344
Enough. Okay?

198
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:00,014
Give me a kiss.

199
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,225
Good night, baby, and happy birthday.

200
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,269
Good night, Aunt Maggie.

201
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:26,165
I told you she'd be mad at you
if you watched the news.

202
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:52,191
<i>I missed you, my dear.</i>

203
00:18:52,274 --> 00:18:54,568
<i>I was afraid you weren't going to show up.</i>

204
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,987
<i>Too bad about the accident.</i>

205
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:59,490
<i>Yes. Papa told us they just found it.</i>

206
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,662
<i>How did you know?</i>

207
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,119
<i>I must have heard it somewhere.</i>

208
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,995
<i>I haven't seen you in so long, darling.</i>

209
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,331
<i>I mean, couldn't we take a little walk,
or something?</i>

210
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,792
<i>It looks as though you haven't had
a breath of fresh air in days.</i>

211
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,172
- <i>A walk?</i>
- <i>Of course.</i>

212
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:14,588
<i>The air outside will do you good.
Besides, you'll work up an appetite.</i>

213
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:15,798
<i>Please.</i>

214
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,424
<i>But, Janice, surely it's going to rain.</i>

215
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,451
Andy?

216
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,995
<i>Depends on whether there's an indictment.</i>

217
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:48,247
<i>Well, they don't always...</i>

218
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:22,072
Andy, is that you?

219
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,870
How did that happen?

220
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,343
Uh... Hello?

221
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,717
Hi. How's it going? How's Andy?

222
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:06,594
<i>Karen?</i>

223
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:09,221
Yeah. Who else would it be?
Is something wrong?

224
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:10,723
Uh...

225
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:12,391
No.

226
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:15,519
Everything's fine.

227
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:19,110
Are you sure?
You don't sound like everything's fine.

228
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,861
No, I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies. You know?

229
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:26,701
Now, would you stop worrying

230
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:29,392
and give Criswell a kick in the pants for me?

231
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:31,952
You got it.

232
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:34,330
Hey, listen, Maggie.
Thank you for everything.

233
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:35,956
You're a real pal.

234
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:37,500
Oh, yeah?

235
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:41,378
Yeah, yeah. Give Andy a kiss for me,
will you? See you soon. Bye.

236
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,378
What is wrong with me?

237
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:25,422
I'm scaring myself half to death.

238
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,413
Step away from this barricade.

239
00:23:57,496 --> 00:24:00,336
Come on, move it back.
There's nothing to see.

240
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,418
Now, let's move this police line back here.

241
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,545
Go on home, folks, please.

242
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,767
She was on the sixth floor.

243
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:30,866
Miss, what do you think you're doing?

244
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:32,364
I live here.

245
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:39,997
Andy?

246
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:43,793
Oh, no. Andy?

247
00:24:45,377 --> 00:24:46,504
Andy?

248
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:48,718
Andy!

249
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:49,965
Mommy!

250
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:52,259
Oh, thank God.

251
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,137
Are you all right?

252
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,852
Oh, I'm so glad. I got so scared when I...

253
00:24:57,932 --> 00:25:00,184
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

254
00:25:00,684 --> 00:25:04,688
- She had an accident.
- Accident? What kind of an accident?

255
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:07,862
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm Detective Mike Norris, Homicide.

256
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:10,031
Could I talk to you out in the hall?

257
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:12,863
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please?

258
00:25:15,157 --> 00:25:16,909
I'll be right back.

259
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,002
Look, Mrs. Barclay...

260
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,386
What?

261
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:38,848
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?

262
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:44,770
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.

263
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:46,814
Oh, no.

264
00:25:49,358 --> 00:25:50,901
You all right?

265
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:53,362
- Yes.
- All right.

266
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:54,864
Come on.

267
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,870
Oh, Maggie.

268
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:02,872
Did you check over here?

269
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,835
Oh, Maggie.

270
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:14,967
You got any idea what these are?

271
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:21,140
No.

272
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,394
They look like footprints, don't they?
Very small footprints.

273
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:28,189
What are you implying?

274
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:30,111
I don't know.

275
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:32,067
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?

276
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:33,114
- What?
- Besides,

277
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:36,784
I already checked his closet.
None of his shoes matched these prints.

278
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:39,787
Mommy? Mommy?

279
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:42,832
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

280
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:45,623
Andy, I want you to go to bed.
The detective and I are very busy.

281
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,209
- But, Mom...
- Right now, please.

282
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:51,504
Andy.

283
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,048
What do you got on your feet?

284
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:57,760
Good Guy PJ sneakers.

285
00:26:57,843 --> 00:26:59,804
Wow. Come here.

286
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:05,184
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

287
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:09,480
Look at this. There's a gun.
Is that a cowboy hat?

288
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:12,695
Andy, get into bed. I'll be in
in a minute to tuck you in.

289
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,693
- But, Mom...
- Right now.

290
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:22,159
Why are you treating Andy like this?

291
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:25,746
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

292
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,878
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those
footprints. If not Andy, then who?

293
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,921
I don't know, and I don't care.

294
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,841
All I know is that I've just lost my best
friend tonight to a horrible accident

295
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,423
and I would like some time alone with my son,

296
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,595
who I'm sure is just as upset
about this as I am.

297
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,344
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

298
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:43,559
I'll clear everybody out of here
right away. Okay?

299
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,517
Hey, guys, you done? Let's go. Chop-chop.

300
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,689
Let's go, everybody. Out of here.

301
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,566
Let's clear this up over here. Come on.

302
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:51,814
Okay.

303
00:27:51,897 --> 00:27:53,566
Let's go, Sid.

304
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,993
What do you think was so important
about my sneakers, Chucky?

305
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:07,371
You don't know either, do you?

306
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:30,561
Well, let me know if you find out
anything about those footprints.

307
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,146
Mommy, Mommy.

308
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:34,819
Mommy, I know who was
on the kitchen counter. I know, I know.

309
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,113
- Andy, I thought I...
- Who, Andy? Who?

310
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:38,444
Chucky!

311
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,321
Your doll?

312
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:42,618
Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.

313
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:45,579
Now, come on, back to bed. Now I mean it.

314
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,036
But, Mom...

315
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:53,209
Good night, Detective.

316
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:58,092
- What?
- Are you gonna call me?

317
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:02,138
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just... I hate loose ends.

318
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,878
And I hate people
who don't know when to stop.

319
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,056
Ouch.

320
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,812
- A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

321
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:11,519
I want that autopsy report on my desk

322
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:12,940
- first thing tomorrow.
- Yeah.

323
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,731
And anything you can find out
about Mrs. Barclay and her son.

324
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:18,487
You got it.
Anything else I can do for you, sir?

325
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:22,324
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.

326
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:23,989
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.

327
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:26,534
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

328
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:27,618
No.

329
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,830
Come on. You're kidding me.

330
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,084
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?

331
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,925
'Cause she saw you walking and talking?

332
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:59,400
I guess there was no hiding from her.

333
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,493
Andy, who are you talking to?

334
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:06,782
Chucky.

335
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,129
Chucky, huh?

336
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,218
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

337
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,592
He's sitting right over there.

338
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:30,893
Chucky's been talking to you, too, hasn't he?

339
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:34,772
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

340
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:38,272
His real name is Charles Lee Ray,

341
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:43,486
and he's been sent down from heaven
by Daddy to play with me.

342
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:51,160
He has, has he? Anything else?

343
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:55,251
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie was a real bitch

344
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,374
and got what she deserved.

345
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:01,337
Andy, how can you say something so horrible?

346
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:04,093
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

347
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:08,260
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up.

348
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:15,226
- But I'm not. Chucky's alive. Really, he is.
- Andy, Chucky... Chucky's a doll.

349
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:17,853
He's made of plastic and stuffing.

350
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:19,480
Look at him. Look at him.

351
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:21,527
Now, does he look like anything else to you?

352
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:23,237
Don't, you'll hurt him.

353
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,735
Andy, look!

354
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:28,993
Now you don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

355
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:30,494
But he is.

356
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:33,119
Andy, stop it. Please.

357
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:38,916
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

358
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:45,256
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

359
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:47,303
I'm sorry.

360
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:50,177
I'll stop making up stories.

361
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:57,017
Thanks, champ.

362
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:00,816
Do you wanna sleep in with me tonight?

363
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:02,898
No, it's all right.

364
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:05,151
I've got Chucky.

365
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:10,573
Come on, into bed.

366
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:17,913
Good night, sweetheart.

367
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:21,375
I love you.

368
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,507
Good night.

369
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:42,271
You're right, Chucky. She didn't believe me.

370
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:51,113
Hi. I like to be hugged.

371
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,451
Good. I'd love to hug you, too.

372
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,008
Hey.

373
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,015
You sure you're all right about last night?

374
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,472
No bad dreams about Aunt Maggie?

375
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:19,475
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

376
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:24,313
All right, off to school with you, then.
I love you tons.

377
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,892
<i>43rd street. Next stop, 47th.</i>

378
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:36,821
Is that Eddie's?

379
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:45,121
Look, you stay here. I have to go tinkle.

380
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:58,592
I'll be right there, Chucky.

381
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,002
Chucky?

382
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,171
Chucky?

383
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,850
Chucky?

384
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:18,441
Chucky?

385
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:20,734
Chucky?

386
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:23,028
Chucky?

387
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,252
Chucky?

388
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:43,966
Chucky?

389
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:08,991
Mrs. Barclay.

390
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:11,956
Detective Norris,
I came as soon as I got your message.

391
00:39:12,036 --> 00:39:13,541
You haven't been to the school
to pick up your son yet?

392
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:17,625
- No. No, I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

393
00:39:19,168 --> 00:39:21,837
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

394
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,424
I...

395
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,767
I don't know how to tell you this,
Mrs. Barclay.

396
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,307
Tell me what?

397
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,772
Do you have any idea why
your Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

398
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:39,021
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

399
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:45,489
'Cause she saw Chucky,
and it scared her so much, she fell out.

400
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:47,196
Oh, she did, huh?

401
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:50,619
So why did Chucky go to see Eddie Caputo?

402
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:51,954
Mommy!

403
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:53,661
Oh, Andy.

404
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:59,917
All right, sweetheart. Come on.

405
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:04,088
Now listen to me, okay?

406
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,800
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

407
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:11,720
Unless you start telling the truth right now,

408
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,891
they're going to take you away from me.

409
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:20,107
You hear that, Chucky?

410
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:23,315
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

411
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:27,987
Please, say something.

412
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:32,328
Come on, Chucky. Say something.

413
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:35,953
Tell me why you lied to me about everything.

414
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:39,248
Come on, Chucky. Say something.

415
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:41,167
Tell me.

416
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,596
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.

417
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:51,051
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose.

418
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:55,518
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

419
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:59,351
<i>Mrs. Barclay, my name is Dr. Ardmore.
I'm from County General.</i>

420
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:01,604
<i>I've seen more than enough.</i>

421
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:05,065
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

422
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:47,024
Well, say something, you little bastard.

423
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:50,778
Say something, damn it!

424
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:54,156
Hi. I like to be hugged.

425
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,367
"He wants you for a best friend."

426
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,077
Yeah, sure.

427
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,833
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

428
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,495
Talk to me.

429
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:49,457
Come on, talk.

430
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,878
I said, talk to me, damn it. All right.

431
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:56,714
Then I'm gonna make you talk!

432
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:13,189
I said talk to me, damn it,
or else I am gonna throw you in the fire!

433
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:15,945
You stupid bitch! You filthy slut!

434
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:19,361
- I'll teach you to fuck with me!
- No! No!

435
00:45:57,691 --> 00:45:58,776
Stop!

436
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:33,894
No.

437
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:37,440
No.

438
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:41,944
No!

439
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:53,831
Detective Norris!

440
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:55,586
Mrs. Barclay, what are you doing back here?

441
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:59,670
Andy was telling the truth.
Chucky is alive and he killed Eddie Caputo.

442
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:01,714
- What?
- I took him home to my apartment.

443
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:05,680
I was about to throw away the box that
he came in when the batteries fell out.

444
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,847
Don't you see?

445
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:10,226
He's been moving and talking for days
without any batteries in him.

446
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:13,350
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll was alive.

447
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:15,773
See, I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace,

448
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,442
when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.

449
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:21,609
I dropped him, and he got up
and ran out of the apartment.

450
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:24,073
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

451
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:27,239
Wait a minute. I am telling you the truth.

452
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:30,493
- He killed Maggie. He killed Eddie Caputo.
- Look, Mrs. Barclay.

453
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,415
I sympathize with you. I really do.

454
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:34,330
I hated what happened in there today.

455
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:38,334
- But lying is not gonna help your son.
- Lying? Does this look like I'm lying?

456
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:42,425
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

457
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:45,261
Oh, for God's sake.

458
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:47,510
All right, don't believe me.

459
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:51,430
- Where you going?
- To find Chucky.

460
00:47:51,514 --> 00:47:52,727
How you gonna do that?

461
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:55,146
I bought him from a peddler where I work.
I'll start there.

462
00:47:55,226 --> 00:47:57,770
That isn't a good part of town
to be in at this time of night.

463
00:47:58,187 --> 00:47:59,730
Mrs. Barclay, do you hear me?

464
00:47:59,814 --> 00:48:02,733
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night.

465
00:48:07,363 --> 00:48:09,198
God damn it.

466
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,066
What's she doing here?

467
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,156
Hey, excuse me.

468
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:33,407
Mister.

469
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:37,453
Mister.

470
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:40,289
I'm not gonna hurt you. Do you remember me?

471
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:42,545
- No, no.
- I'm sorry. I bought a doll from you

472
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,794
in back of Carson's department store
with my friend yesterday.

473
00:49:44,877 --> 00:49:46,754
- Doll?
- Yes, a Good Guy doll.

474
00:49:46,837 --> 00:49:50,466
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?

475
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:54,348
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

476
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:59,308
I don't have much,
but you're welcome to whatever I have.

477
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:04,438
It's not enough. What else you got?

478
00:50:05,356 --> 00:50:07,817
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

479
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:11,028
- What are you... Yes.
- That's not all you got.

480
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:12,533
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

481
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:14,782
No. No, no.

482
00:50:14,865 --> 00:50:17,952
No. Wait. No, no!

483
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:19,078
Pig!

484
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:23,165
- Christ, he's a cop!
- All right. What about the rest of you?

485
00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:25,000
You wanna party, too?

486
00:50:31,507 --> 00:50:33,968
All right. Now, you want to answer
the lady's question now?

487
00:50:34,051 --> 00:50:37,725
- Where did you get the doll from?
- I don't know nothing about no doll.

488
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:39,557
You're not gonna know nothing
about nothing in a minute,

489
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,016
unless you talk to me. Now talk!

490
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,687
A burned-out toy store on Wabash.
That's where I got it.

491
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:48,399
Get out of here.

492
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:51,986
What's wrong?

493
00:50:53,404 --> 00:50:54,447
Nothing.

494
00:50:56,365 --> 00:50:58,909
Well, wait a minute. Something
the peddler said upset you. What was it?

495
00:50:58,993 --> 00:51:00,953
I just told you, nothing.

496
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:05,458
God damn it. My son's life is at stake.
Now, what was it?

497
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:10,713
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.

498
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:11,922
Who?

499
00:51:12,006 --> 00:51:16,135
The Lake Shore Strangler. The man
who's partners with Eddie Caputo.

500
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:19,638
- Hey. Where are you going now?
- Wabash and Van Buren.

501
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:22,144
There's nothing there.
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.

502
00:51:22,224 --> 00:51:23,270
Why don't you believe me?

503
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,645
It was struck by lightning
the night that Charles Lee Ray died.

504
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:29,774
How do you know that?

505
00:51:29,857 --> 00:51:33,068
Because I was there.
I was the man who killed him.

506
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:41,660
Why didn't you tell me?

507
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:45,873
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

508
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:49,627
Come on, let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

509
00:51:49,919 --> 00:51:51,462
Did he say anything? Anything at all?

510
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:52,675
- Who?
- Charles Lee Ray.

511
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:55,841
Yeah. He threatened
to kill me and Eddie Caputo.

512
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,445
I'm sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

513
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:14,110
I really am.

514
00:52:14,193 --> 00:52:17,613
But I did.
I found out that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

515
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,367
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

516
00:52:22,868 --> 00:52:25,913
- Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

517
00:52:26,622 --> 00:52:29,003
Look, please,
will you just get out of the car?

518
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,880
Hey, just tell me where he lived.

519
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,088
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

520
00:52:34,296 --> 00:52:36,927
930 Stoney Island, the south side.

521
00:52:37,007 --> 00:52:40,886
But I've already checked the place out.
There's nothing there. Now, good night.

522
00:52:41,137 --> 00:52:43,639
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

523
00:52:44,014 --> 00:52:46,103
- Home, to get some sleep.
- No, you can't do that.

524
00:52:46,183 --> 00:52:48,686
Don't you see? You just said it.

525
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,147
Chucky killed Caputo. That leaves you.

526
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,732
- That does it.
- Please listen to me.

527
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,531
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth.

528
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:01,657
Why won't you believe me?

529
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,702
Because I'm sane, Mrs. Barclay.
Sane and rational.

530
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:08,706
All right. All right.

531
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:11,125
Do you remember what you said
the first night you met me in my apartment?

532
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,002
- What about it?
- You said you didn't like loose ends.

533
00:53:13,085 --> 00:53:14,086
Well, I'm a loose end.

534
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,964
You can't just let go what I said tonight
without checking it out.

535
00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:19,800
For the last time, Mrs. Barclay, good night.

536
00:54:17,566 --> 00:54:19,360
Good night, asshole.

537
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,543
Jeez, look out!

538
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,345
Hi, Mikey.

539
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:21,440
Won't do you any good, Mikey.
You can't hurt me.

540
00:58:44,157 --> 00:58:45,325
Karen.

541
00:58:49,964 --> 00:58:52,066
What are you doing here?

542
00:58:53,509 --> 00:58:55,177
After I talked to you last night,

543
00:58:55,261 --> 00:58:58,764
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

544
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,601
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky,

545
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:06,897
and he spent a lot of time with this man.

546
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:16,115
Now, all we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

547
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:26,375
Hello, John.

548
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:29,879
Over here.

549
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:31,922
Hi.

550
00:59:32,882 --> 00:59:34,467
It's me. Chucky.

551
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:38,471
What do you think? The grigri work?

552
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:44,226
You know, when I came here learning
all that stuff about how to beat death,

553
00:59:44,351 --> 00:59:46,937
I thought maybe you were pulling my chain.

554
00:59:47,021 --> 00:59:49,231
But not now. Not now.

555
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:52,735
- Only one problem.
- What?

556
00:59:53,944 --> 00:59:56,864
This. I didn't think anybody could hurt me.

557
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,325
But last night, I got shot.

558
01:00:00,076 --> 01:00:02,244
You know something? It hurt.

559
01:00:02,328 --> 01:00:05,247
It hurt like a son of a bitch. It even bled.

560
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:07,500
Now why's that, John?

561
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:10,169
- You're turning human.
- What?

562
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:14,131
The more time you spend in that body,

563
01:00:15,424 --> 01:00:17,635
the more human you'll become.

564
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:22,264
You mean I have to live out
the rest of my life in this body?

565
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:26,435
No fucking way.
You got me into this, you get me out.

566
01:00:28,145 --> 01:00:30,648
- I can't do that, Chucky.
- Why not?

567
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:37,238
Because you're an abomination,
an outrage against nature.

568
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:42,330
You perverted everything
I've taught you and used it for evil.

569
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,245
And you have to be stopped.

570
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:50,963
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

571
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:54,296
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

572
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,966
Your own personal mojo, doc.

573
01:00:58,342 --> 01:01:01,720
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it? Broken leg?

574
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:09,353
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this, John.

575
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:11,814
Gets you in trouble every time.

576
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:14,400
Now how do I get out of this body?

577
01:01:14,483 --> 01:01:17,194
- No, I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

578
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:23,701
Tell me or die, John. Your choice.

579
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:25,953
No, I'll tell you.

580
01:01:28,372 --> 01:01:31,709
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll

581
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:35,838
into that of the first human being
you revealed your true self to.

582
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:40,634
You mean the first person I let in
on the fact that I was really alive?

583
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:45,935
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.

584
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:50,147
The first person I let in on my little secret
was a six-year-old kid.

585
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:52,646
I'm gonna be six years old again.

586
01:01:52,897 --> 01:01:56,525
Well, John, it's been fun, but I gotta go.

587
01:01:57,109 --> 01:01:59,779
I have a date with a six-year-old boy.

588
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:03,824
And you have a date with death.

589
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:09,205
So long, John.

590
01:02:34,313 --> 01:02:36,273
Hold it. Wait, wait.

591
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:45,408
Oh, my God.

592
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:50,496
- Too late.
- What?

593
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,916
Must save the boy. Must...

594
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:58,712
Must get his soul...

595
01:02:59,713 --> 01:03:02,550
into him like he got into doll.

596
01:03:02,925 --> 01:03:04,051
What?

597
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:08,055
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

598
01:03:08,764 --> 01:03:11,475
Kill him before he can say it.

599
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:13,352
But how? How?

600
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:18,399
The heart. His heart is almost human.

601
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:24,071
It's the only way. Through the heart.

602
01:03:42,047 --> 01:03:45,843
Help me! Help me! Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

603
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,483
Help me! He's coming to kill me!
He's here. Chucky's here.

604
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:02,443
I don't see anybody.

605
01:04:04,028 --> 01:04:06,530
But, Doctor, Chucky's here,

606
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:08,741
and he's going to kill me.

607
01:04:12,036 --> 01:04:16,207
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!

608
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,171
He's going to kill me.

609
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:25,341
Please don't leave me. Please.

610
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,353
No!

611
01:05:22,064 --> 01:05:25,192
- Andy, stop.
- Hey, wait a minute.

612
01:05:25,276 --> 01:05:26,569
Stop him!

613
01:05:39,623 --> 01:05:41,625
Check the north corridor.

614
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:29,673
Easy. Easy, it's all right, Andy.
It's all right.

615
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:32,551
You're not gonna
need this anymore, all right?

616
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,764
But I do. Chucky's in the room,
and he's trying to kill me.

617
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:39,266
No, Andy. It's gonna be all right.
I'm here now.

618
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,060
And I'm gonna protect you.

619
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:44,146
Andy. Easy, boy. Easy.

620
01:06:44,605 --> 01:06:46,315
Come on, nobody's here.

621
01:06:46,398 --> 01:06:49,151
- No, please. He'll kill you, too.
- Andy, now...

622
01:06:49,235 --> 01:06:52,283
No, please. Listen to me. Please.

623
01:06:52,363 --> 01:06:55,783
Andy, now this is just gonna
sting you for one second.

624
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,593
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

625
01:07:19,432 --> 01:07:20,474
Stop.

626
01:07:37,992 --> 01:07:39,160
What happened?

627
01:07:39,243 --> 01:07:41,499
Look, miss, could you just
excuse us for a minute here, all right?

628
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:42,705
What?

629
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:46,962
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

630
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:50,299
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine and then he escaped.

631
01:07:50,379 --> 01:07:52,006
Escaped? Where?

632
01:07:52,089 --> 01:07:55,301
We don't know, but I bet she does.

633
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:03,017
Chucky. You seen Chucky anywhere?

634
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:05,648
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

635
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:08,814
The same one that was at the station house.
Have you seen him anywhere?

636
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:11,692
What am I gonna know about a doll?
Where are you going?

637
01:08:15,321 --> 01:08:16,363
They think Andy did it.

638
01:08:16,447 --> 01:08:19,829
I know, the girl said that Chucky was here,
and that he was looking for Andy.

639
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:21,664
- But where would Andy go?
- He'd go home.

640
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:23,370
I always told him to go there
if he was in trouble.

641
01:08:23,454 --> 01:08:25,334
- Does he have a key?
- It's under the mat.

642
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:26,582
Come on. Come on. We don't have much time.

643
01:08:52,858 --> 01:08:54,026
Look, George.

644
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:57,154
- Some child left their doll in the elevator.
- Leave it alone.

645
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:00,032
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.

646
01:09:05,413 --> 01:09:06,747
Ugly doll.

647
01:09:08,749 --> 01:09:10,000
Fuck you.

648
01:10:54,355 --> 01:10:55,648
Surprise!

649
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:28,225
Batter up!

650
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:15,060
Give me the power, I beg of you.

651
01:12:32,828 --> 01:12:33,954
Andy!

652
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:40,131
Andy!

653
01:12:40,211 --> 01:12:41,924
- Andy!
- Andy!

654
01:12:42,004 --> 01:12:43,798
Andy, can you hear me?

655
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:51,097
Andy!

656
01:12:52,348 --> 01:12:53,474
Andy!

657
01:13:01,273 --> 01:13:02,399
Andy.

658
01:13:02,942 --> 01:13:05,444
Karen, Karen, are you all right?

659
01:13:09,323 --> 01:13:10,449
Oh, Mike.

660
01:13:10,574 --> 01:13:12,535
Just take care of Andy.

661
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:18,165
Karen, Karen.

662
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:20,918
- Take this. Take it.
- Mike!

663
01:13:23,504 --> 01:13:24,755
Mommy.

664
01:14:24,857 --> 01:14:26,984
What's wrong? Gun jammed?

665
01:15:05,564 --> 01:15:06,690
Andy!

666
01:15:06,774 --> 01:15:09,151
Andy, help me. The matches.

667
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,153
Andy!

668
01:15:11,237 --> 01:15:12,655
Please! Now!

669
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:26,460
Andy, no, please.

670
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:30,131
We're friends to the end. Remember?

671
01:15:30,548 --> 01:15:33,676
This is the end, friend.

672
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:19,722
Oh, my baby.

673
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:21,599
Karen? Andy?

674
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:23,684
You all right?

675
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:34,695
Andy, go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast. Okay?

676
01:16:34,779 --> 01:16:38,282
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Chucky's dead.

677
01:16:50,836 --> 01:16:53,339
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

678
01:16:54,548 --> 01:16:56,258
Andy, hurry up.

679
01:16:57,635 --> 01:16:58,761
Andy.

680
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:14,568
Hello, Andy.

681
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:18,406
Mommy.

682
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:20,908
Mommy.

683
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:23,661
Mommy!

684
01:17:27,665 --> 01:17:32,294
Give me the boy, and I'll let you live.
Do you hear me? Give me the boy.

685
01:17:56,026 --> 01:17:57,236
Mommy!

686
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:32,021
Give me the boy.

687
01:19:41,674 --> 01:19:43,012
What the hell's going on here?

688
01:19:43,092 --> 01:19:45,886
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
- Karen.

689
01:19:54,019 --> 01:19:55,396
Oh, Jesus.

690
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,277
Yeah, I got a cop down here.
Multiple stab wounds.

691
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,113
The Brewster Apartments
on North Grand Street. Make it fast.

692
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:07,616
All right, they're gonna be here in
10 minutes. Now, tell me what happened.

693
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,202
The kid was right. The doll's alive.

694
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:14,582
- He almost got the three of us.
- Come on, what are you talking about?

695
01:20:14,915 --> 01:20:18,335
You don't believe me? All right,
well, go on. Check it out in the hall.

696
01:20:18,419 --> 01:20:22,465
It's scattered all over the place.
But don't touch it. Do you understand me?

697
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:25,843
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right, look. Take it easy, okay?

698
01:20:25,926 --> 01:20:28,471
Just relax yourself, all right? All right.

699
01:21:06,926 --> 01:21:09,553
Okay, Mike. I'd like you to take a look
at this thing, okay?

700
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:12,098
Because there's no way this thing's alive.

701
01:21:13,641 --> 01:21:16,811
- I thought I told you not to touch it.
- Mike, will you be sensible?

702
01:21:16,894 --> 01:21:19,146
Come on, look.
It's as dead as they come. It's dead.

703
01:21:21,065 --> 01:21:23,192
Choke him! Kill him!

704
01:21:23,275 --> 01:21:25,820
I'll rip his throat out.

705
01:21:25,903 --> 01:21:26,904
Kill him!

706
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:31,784
Kill him.

707
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:40,793
Kill him now! Strangle him! Don't let go!

708
01:21:46,132 --> 01:21:47,216
God.

709
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:58,602
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

710
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:01,397
The heart. Shoot him in the heart.

711
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:28,632
Hi, I'm Chucky.

712
01:22:29,008 --> 01:22:33,471
Wanna play?

713
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,524
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

714
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,759
But who's gonna believe me?

715
01:22:55,618 --> 01:22:56,869
Come on.

716
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:01,165
All right. Ready? Here we go.

717
01:23:07,046 --> 01:23:08,297
Come on.

718
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:22,686
Andy.

719
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:26,107
Come on.
We're gonna go to the hospital with Mike.

720
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:27,608
Let's go.
