00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:36,784
I already checked his closet.
None of his shoes matched these prints.

313
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:39,787
Mommy? Mommy?

314
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:42,832
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

315
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:45,623
Andy, I want you to go to bed.
The detective and I are very busy.

316
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,209
- But, Mom...
- Right now, please.

317
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:51,504
MIKE: Andy.

318
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,048
What do you got on your feet?

319
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:57,760
Good Guy PJ sneakers.

320
00:26:57,843 --> 00:26:59,804
Wow. Come here.

321
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:05,184
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

322
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:09,480
Look at this. There's a gun.
Is that a cowboy hat?

323
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:12,695
Andy, get into bed. I'll be in
in a minute to tuck you in.

324
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,693
- But, Mom...
- Right now.

325
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:22,159
Why are you treating Andy like this?

326
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:25,746
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

327
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,878
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those
footprints. If not Andy, then who?

328
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,921
I don't know, and I don't care.

329
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,841
All I know is that I've just lost my best
friend tonight to a horrible accident

330
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,423
and I would like some time alone with my son,

331
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,595
who I'm sure is just as upset
about this as I am.

332
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,344
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

333
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:43,559
I'll clear everybody out of here
right away. Okay?

Let's clear this up over here. Come on.

339
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,993
What do you think was so important
about my sneakers, Chucky?

340
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:07,371
You don't know either, do you?

341
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:30,561
Well, let me know if you find out
anything about those footprints.

342
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,146
Mommy, Mommy.

343
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:34,819
Mommy, I know who was
on the kitchen counter. I know, I know.

344
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,113
- Andy, I thought I...
- Who, Andy? Who?

345
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:38,444
Chucky!

346
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,321
Your doll?

347
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:42,618
KAREN:
Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.

348
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:45,579
Now, come on, back to bed. Now I mean it.

349
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,036
But, Mom...

350
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:53,209
Good night, Detective.

351
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:58,092
- What?
- Are you gonna call me?

352
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:02,138
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just... I hate loose ends.

353
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,678
And I hate people
who don't know when to stop.

Ouch.

356
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,812
- A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

357
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:11,519
I want that autopsy report on my desk

358
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:12,940
- first thing tomorrow.
- Yeah.

359
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,731
And anything you can find out
about Mrs. Barclay and her son.

360
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:18,487
You got it.
Anything else I can do for you, sir?

361
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:22,324
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.

362
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:23,989
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.

363
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:26,534
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

364
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:27,618
No.

365
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,830
Come on. You're kidding me.

366
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,084
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?

367
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,925
ANDY: 'Cause she saw you walking and talking?

368
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:59,400
I guess there was no hiding from her.

369
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,493
Andy, who are you talking to?

370
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:06,782
Chucky.

371
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,129
Chucky, huh?

372
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,218
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

373
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,592
He's sitting right over there.

374
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:30,893
Chucky's been talking to you, too, hasn't he?

375
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:34,772
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

376
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:38,272
His real name is Charles Lee Ray,

377
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:43,486
and he's been sent down from heaven
by Daddy to play with me.

378
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:51,160
He has, has he? Anything else?

379
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:55,251
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie was a real bitch

380
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,374
and got what she deserved.

381
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:01,337
Andy, how can you say something so horrible?

382
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:04,093
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

383
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:08,260
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up.

384
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:15,226
- But I'm not. Chucky's alive. Really, he is.
- Andy, Chucky... Chucky's a doll.

385
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:17,853
He's made of plastic and stuffing.

386
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:19,480
Look at him. Look at him.

387
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:21,527
Now, does he look like anything else to you?

388
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:23,237
Don't, you'll hurt him.

389
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,735
Andy, look!

390
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:28,993
Now you don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

391
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:30,494
But he is.

392
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:33,119
Andy, stop it. Please.

393
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:38,916
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

394
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:45,256
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

395
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:47,303
I'm sorry.

396
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:50,177
I'll stop making up stories.

397
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:57,017

Mrs. Barclay, what are you doing back here?

498
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:59,670
Andy was telling the truth.
Chucky is alive and he killed Eddie Caputo.

499
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:01,714
- What?
- I took him home to my apartment.

500
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:05,680
I was about to throw away the box that
he came in when the batteries fell out.

Don't you see?

502
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:10,226
He's been moving and talking for days
without any batteries in him.

503
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:13,350
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll was alive.

504
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:15,773
See, I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace,

505
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,442
when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.

506
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:21,609
I dropped him, and he got up
and ran out of the apartment.

507
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:24,073
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

508
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:27,239
Wait a minute. I am telling you the truth.

509
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:30,493
- He killed Maggie. He killed Eddie Caputo.
- Look, Mrs. Barclay.

510
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,415
I sympathize with you. I really do.

511

00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,794
in back of Carson's department store
with my friend yesterday.

- Doll?
- Yes, a Good Guy doll.

532
00:49:46,837 --> 00:49:50,466
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?

00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:54,348
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

but you're welcome to whatever I have.

- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:11,028
- What are you... Yes.
- That's not all you got.

- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

545
00:50:34,051 --> 00:50:37,725
- Where did you get the doll from?
- I don't know nothing about no doll.

546

You're not gonna know nothing
about nothing in a minute,

Nothing.

552
00:50:56,365 --> 00:50:58,909
Well, wait a minute. Something
the peddler said upset you. What was it?

553
00:50:58,993 --> 00:51:00,953
I just told you, nothing.

554
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:05,458
God damn it. My son's life is at stake.
Now, what was it?

555
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:10,713
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.

556
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:11,922
Who?

557
00:51:12,006 --> 00:51:16,135
The Lake Shore Strangler. The man
who's partners with Eddie Caputo.

558
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:19,638
- Hey. Where are you going now?
- Wabash and Van Buren.

559
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:22,144
There's nothing there.
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.

Why don't you believe me?

561
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,645
It was struck by lightning
the night that Charles Lee Ray died.

562
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:29,774
How do you know that?

563
00:51:29,857 --> 00:51:33,068
Because I was there.
I was the man who killed him.

564
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:41,660
Why didn't you tell me?

565
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:45,873
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

566
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:49,627
Come on, let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

567
00:51:49,919 --> 00:51:51,462
Did he say anything? Anything at all?

568
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:52,675
- Who?
- Charles Lee Ray.

569
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:55,841
Yeah. He threatened
to kill me and Eddie Caputo.

570
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,445
I'm sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

I really am.

572
00:52:14,193 --> 00:52:17,613
But I did.
I found out that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

573
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,367
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

574
00:52:22,868 --> 00:52:25,913
- Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

575
00:52:26,622 --> 00:52:29,003
Look, please,
will you just get out of the car?

576

There's nothing there. Now, good night.

580

Wait a minute. Where are you going?

581
00:52:44,014 --> 00:52:46,103
- Home, to get some sleep.
- No, you can't do that.

582
00:52:46,183 --> 00:52:48,686
Don't you see? You just said it.

583
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,147
Chucky killed Caputo. That leaves you.

584
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,732
- That does it.
- Please listen to me.

- Out.
- I am telling you the truth.

00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:29,879
Over here.

630
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:31,922
Hi.

631
00:59:32,882 --> 00:59:34,467
It's me. Chucky.

632
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:38,471
What do you think? The grigri work?

633
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:44,226
You know, when I came here learning
all that stuff about how to beat death,

634
00:59:44,351 --> 00:59:46,937
I thought maybe you were pulling my chain.

635
00:59:47,021 --> 00:59:49,231
But not now. Not now.

636
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:52,735
- Only one problem.
- What?

637
00:59:53,944 --> 00:59:56,864
This. I didn't think anybody could hurt me.

638
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,325
But last night, I got shot.

639
01:00:00,076 --> 01:00:02,244
You know something? It hurt.

640
01:00:02,328 --> 01:00:05,247
It hurt like a son of a bitch. It even bled.

641
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:07,500
Now why's that, John?

642
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:10,169
- You're turning human.
- What?

643
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:14,131
The more time you spend in that body,

644
01:00:15,424 --> 01:00:17,635
the more human you'll become.

645
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:22,264
You mean I have to live out
the rest of my life in this body?

646
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:26,435
No fucking way.
You got me into this, you get me out.

647
01:00:28,145 --> 01:00:30,648
- I can't do that, Chucky.
- Why not?

648
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:37,238
Because you're an abomination,
an outrage against nature.

649
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:42,330
You perverted everything
I've taught you and used it for evil.

650
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,245
And you have to be stopped.

651
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:50,963
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

652
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:54,296
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

653
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,966

Andy.

Hello, Andy.

795
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:18,406
Mommy.

01:17:27,665 --> 01:17:29,754
Give me the boy, and I'll let you live.

800
01:17:29,834 --> 01:17:32,294
Do you hear me? Give me the boy.

Oh, Jesus.

811
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,277
Yeah, I got a cop down here.
Multiple stab wounds.

812
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,113
The Brewster Apartments
on North Grand Street. Make it fast.

813
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:07,616
All right, they're gonna be here in
10 minutes. Now, tell me what happened.

814
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,202
The kid was right. The doll's alive.

815
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:14,582
- He almost got the three of us.
- Come on, what are you talking about?

816
01:20:14,915 --> 01:20:18,335
You don't believe me? All right,
well, go on. Check it out in the hall.

817
01:20:18,419 --> 01:20:22,465
It's scattered all over the place.
But don't touch it. Do you understand me?

818
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:25,843
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right, look. Take it easy, okay?

819
01:20:25,926 --> 01:20:28,471
Just relax yourself, all right? All right.

820
01:21:06,926 --> 01:21:09,553
Okay, Mike. I'd like you to take a look
at this thing, okay?

821
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:12,098
Because there's no way this thing's alive.

822
01:21:13,641 --> 01:21:16,811
- I thought I told you not to touch it.
- Mike, will you be sensible?

823
01:21:16,894 --> 01:21:19,146
Come on, look.
It's as dead as they come. It's dead.

I'll rip his throat out.

827
01:21:25,903 --> 01:21:26,904
Kill him!

828
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:31,784
Kill him.

829
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:40,793
Kill him now! Strangle him! Don't let go!

Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

832

Wanna play?

836

- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

837
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,759
But who's gonna believe me?

We're gonna go to the hospital with Mike.
