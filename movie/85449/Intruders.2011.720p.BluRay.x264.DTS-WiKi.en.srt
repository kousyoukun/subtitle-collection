JOHN: Hollowface woke up
because someone
called his name.

979
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:50,958
Hollowface
wasn't old or young,
ugly or handsome.

980
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:56,922
He had no shape,
he didn't even
have a face.

981
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,344
He had nothing.

982
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,561
But now,

983
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:15,399
after many,
many years,

984
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:19,403
he was free.

985
