看来你是对的，警官。

是,……真的有必要吗?

你要是再把我置于那种境地…我一枪崩了你的脑袋。
You ever put me in a position like that again... I'll put a bullet through your fuckin' skull.

是的，但是... ..你从哪儿弄来的药，上校?
Yes, but then... ..where would you get your medicine from, Colonel?

我们这个月的血清量不够了。
We're not going to make our serum quota this month.

00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:19,879
而且，一旦我们抓到她…
And besides, once we get our hands on her...

131
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:25,852
．．我们不用再担心这个了。
..we won't have to worry about that anymore.

132
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:13,533
唉,
Agh!

133
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:23,976
等等!等等，等等，等等，等等!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:37,315
打开仓门!
Open bunker door!

138
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,987
他妈的白痴。
Fuckin' idiots.

139
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,469
现在就动手有点晚了，不是吗?
It's a bit late for a barrel drop, ain't it?

140
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:59,605
这不关你的事，冠军。
It's not your concern, champ.

141

Oi !Oi !我需要那该死的燃料，你们这群白痴。
Oi! Oi! I need that fuckin' fuel for the barrel drop, you fuckin' idiots.

现在去找她。

00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:43,448
射死她的腿。
Oh, shoot her fuckin' legs out.

151
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:45,751
嘿,嘿,嘿!等等，等等，等等。
Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

152
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:47,820
我可以让她冷静下来。我可以让她冷静下来。
I can calm her down. I can calm her down.

153
00:22:47,854 --> 00:22:49,889
让她还。

154
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,591
别动，别动。

00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:53,960
给你，亲爱的，给你，给你。
Here you go, hon. Here you go, here you go.

156
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:56,963
那就这样吧。那就这样吧。
There you go. There you go.

157
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:58,496
放松。

00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:00,700
放松。
Easy.

159

我想知道这个人是怎么回事。

如果她是治愈方法的关键，我想知道。

你上你的卡车。
You get in your truck.

167
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:33,900
像个好士兵一样放下枪，滚远点。

168
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,711
关上仓门!

169
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:15,141
哦,妈的…现在我他妈的没油了，不是吗?
Oh, for fuck's... Now I've run out of fuckin' fuel, haven't I?

170
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:22,682

我明天再来接你，伙计。

来人是谁?

190
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:46,192
嘿，别对着我，你个混蛋。
Hey, not on me, you fuckin' peanut.

191
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:48,828
耶稣基督。
Jesus Christ.

192
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:50,262
我有桶给你。
I got barrels for ya.

193
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:53,799

他妈的猫咪。

00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,741
你是一个白痴。
You're an idiot.

197
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:21,127
喂!。
G'day.

198
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:25,264
这个是去地堡的吗?
Is this one for the bunker?

199
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:29,034
这是为了掩体里的孩子们，对吗?
That for the boys in the bunker, is it?

200
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:34,907
好。桶在后面。

是的,先生。

202
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:01,700
白痴。
Dickhead.

203
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:03,135
他妈的。

204
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:45,271
等待。等等，等等，等等!
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

205
00:29:45,304 --> 00:29:47,172
-等等，等等，不，不，不!——不要动!
- Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! - Hold still!

206
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:09,962
都撑不过去了。
Not even gonna make it.

207
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:11,797
他妈的下地狱!
Fuckin' hell!

208
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:27,279
他妈的!来吧!
Fuck! Come on!

209
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:37,189
嘿!你好!
Hey! Hello!

210
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:40,459
对，对，对，看这个!
Yes, yes, yes, look at this!

211
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:43,295
嘿?快点，抓住它!
Hey? Come on, get it!

212
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:45,064
他妈的!
Fuck!

213
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:38,277
我想让你用鼻子深吸一口气，想象一束蓝色的治疗光深入你的头顶脉轮。
I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose and visualise a stream of blue healing light travelling deep into your crown chakra.

214
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:45,552
这种能量会进入你的整个大脑……
This energy travels down into your whole head...

215
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:59,998
．．神圣的愈合……
..sacred healing...

216
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:09,676
哦,他妈的!
Oh, fuck!

217
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,421
他妈的!
Fuck!

218
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:31,531
让你的整个生命从恐惧中解脱出来。
Let your entire being be free from fear.

219
00:33:31,564 --> 00:33:36,001
与宇宙完全和平相处。
and completely at peace with the universe.

220
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:10,770
哇,放松!
Whoa, easy. Easy, easy!

221
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:16,208
你要在这里告诉我你要帮我找回我妹妹。
This is where you tell me you're gonna help me get my sister back.

222
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:18,076
不然我就用枪射穿你的脑袋。
Or I'll put this dart through your fuckin' head.

223
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,546
确定。
Sure.

224
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,446
你妹妹是谁?
Who's your sister?

225
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:31,591
我和你去兜兜风。
Me and you are going for a drive.

226
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:34,293
你得去看看你的伤口。
You'll have to get that wound looked at.

227
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:39,131
如果你离开那里，你会得败血症，然后死掉。
If you leave that you'll get septicaemia and you'll die.

228
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:40,533
是的,对的。
Yeah, right.

229
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,401
我所要做的就是放了你，好吗?
And all I have to do is cut you loose, yeah?

230
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:46,673
听着，我相信我们有办法解决这个问题让我们彼此信任。
Listen, I'm sure there's some way we can work this out where we can both trust each other.

231
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:58,216
听着,你会……你能把手指从扳机上拿开吗?
Listen, would you... Would you mind taking your finger off that trigger there?

232
00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:01,186
闭嘴，缝合。
Shut up and stitch.

233
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,291
我这样做。
I'm doing it.

234
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:10,462
举起手来。
Get your hands up.

235
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:12,832
——举起手来!——它们。
- Hands up! - They're up.

236
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:15,668
他妈的下地狱。神。
Fuckin' hell. God.

237
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:23,576
启动发动机。
Start the engine.

238
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,581
停止。
Stop.

239
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,469
好了，我们开始吧。
OK, off we go.

240
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:52,371
我们必须打开大门。
We have to open the gate.

241
00:35:52,404 --> 00:35:53,806
击穿。
Smash through it.

242
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,677
我们会直接弹开，你的脸会撞到仪表盘上。
We'll bounce straight off and you're gonna smash your face on the dashboard.

243
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,444
不,这是废话。
Nah, that's bullshit.

244
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:01,614
你只是不想把你的小门弄乱。
You just don't want to mess up your nice little gate.

245
00:36:01,648 --> 00:36:03,382
这是你的电话。
It's your call.

246
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,851
这样做。
Do it.

247
00:36:27,472 --> 00:36:29,241
漂亮的卡车。
Nice truck.

248
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:35,414
不跟我说话?
Not talking to me, huh?

249
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:36,916
随便你。
Suit yourself.

250
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,691
那是什么?
What's that?

251
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:46,291
它看起来像什么?
What does it look like?

252
00:36:46,324 --> 00:36:47,627
他们的药。
They're pills.

253
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:50,429
抗病毒药物。
Anti-viral pills.

254
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:52,732
这是我在这里生存的方式。
It's how I stay alive up here.

255
00:36:58,336 --> 00:36:59,872
你为什么拿着这个?
Why have you got this?

256
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:03,442
因为他们是恐怖分子。他们是杀手。
'Cause they're terrorists. They're killers.

257
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:07,714
你不就是这么做的吗?
Ain't that what you do?

258
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,949
不，那不是我的工作。
No, that's not what I do.

259
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,551
我看过尸体。
I've seen the bodies.

260
00:37:11,584 --> 00:37:14,921
你绑架人，然后杀了他们!
You kidnap people and you kill 'em!

261
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,790
我们不杀人。
We don't kill anybody.

262
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:40,498
-有我们的包裹吗?-是的。
- You got a package for us? - Yeah.

263
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:46,471
那是混血女孩的妹妹。
It's the hybrid girl's sister.

264
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:48,040
没有大便。
No shit.

265
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,543
你可真忙，里斯。
You've been a busy boy, Rhys.

266
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,146
好了,伙计。
Well played, mate.

267
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,549
-去找她。——是的,先生。
- Go and get her. - Yes, sir.

268
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,456
他妈的!他妈的……
Fuck! Fuckin'...

269
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:10,529
嘿!嘿，放轻松，伙计。她是个该死的孩子。
Hey! Hey take it easy, mate. She's a fuckin' kid.

270
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:13,132
不管怎样，这个小混蛋都会死在木桶里。
Either way, this little prick's gonna end up in a fuckin' barrel.

271
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:15,500
你说什么，伙计?
What'd you say, mate?

272
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:17,904
"不管怎样，她最后都会死在桶里"这他妈是什么意思?
"Either way, she ends up in a barrel"? What the fuck does that mean?

273
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:21,439
意思是上车开走，下士。
It means get in your vehicle and drive away, Corporal.

274
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,012
上你的车。
Get in your vehicle.

275
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:28,114
车程。
Drive away.

276
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:32,084
好。
Righto.

277
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:49,201
哇。他妈的怎么回事?
Whoa. What the fuck just happened?

278
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,840
上车。
Get in the truck.

279
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:16,028
他妈的!
Fuck!

280
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:31,811
大便。狗屎!
Shit. Shit!

281
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:47,059
——屎!-硝基激活。
- Shit! - Nitro activated.

282
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:48,894
操的缘故。
Fuck's sakes.

283
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:02,508
——电源启动。——加油!' !他妈的' !
- Power priming. - Come on! Prime! Fuckin' prime!

284
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:23,129
——甲烷低。—更换电源。
- Methane low. - Replace power source.

285
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:28,534
别担心。他们没有硝基。
Don't worry. They don't have nitro.

286
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:34,306
你确定吗?
You sure about that?

287
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:38,878
他妈的狗屎! !
Fuckin' shit!!

288
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:54,827
Wakey-wakey !
Wakey-wakey!

289
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,929
去他妈的抓狗!
Fuckin' get the dog!

290
00:42:59,265 --> 00:43:01,934
——吃到坚果了!——牛眼灯!
- - Got the nuts! - Bullseye!

291
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:06,172
感觉怎么样，猛男?
How's that feel, slugger?

292
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:08,908
感觉不太好，是吧?
Doesn't feel too good, does it, hey?

293
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:10,810
他妈的疼。
Fuckin' hurts.

294
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:15,581
你看，在这里叛国者是会被判死刑的，下士。
See, traitors get the death penalty around here, Corporal.

295
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:27,026
我认为……任何一个在别人倒下时踢他蛋蛋的人... ..不应该让一个士兵去死。
I reckon... any man who kicks another man in the balls when he's down... ..don't deserve a soldier's death.

296
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:30,963
你哥哥死得很有尊严。
See, your brother, he died with dignity.

297
00:43:30,996 --> 00:43:32,264
荣誉。
Honour.

298
00:43:32,298 --> 00:43:34,266
像个真正的男人。
Like a real man.

299
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,877
但你不是一个真正的男人，对吧，嘿?
But you're not a real man, are ya, hey?

300
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,179
你是一只狗。
You're a dog.

301
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,748
你这个卑鄙下流的家伙。
You're a lowdown, dirty dog.

302
00:43:49,782 --> 00:43:52,751
你会像条狗一样死去。
And you're gonna die like a fuckin' dog.

303
00:43:53,886 --> 00:43:57,022
看到这些老家伙了吗，蹑手蹑脚的?
You see these old boys, creeping up?

304
00:44:02,128 --> 00:44:04,230
他们几分钟后就到。
They'll be here in a couple of minutes.

305
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:07,266
等他们来了，他们会把你的脚全吃了。
And when they get here, they're gonna eat you from the feet up.

306
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,002
首先你的脚。
First your feet.

307
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:11,871
然后你的腿。
Then your legs.

308
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:13,405
你的球。
Your balls.

309
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,207
这个顺序。
In that order.

310
00:44:17,977 --> 00:44:19,912
像你这样的大块头。
Big tough guy like you.

311
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:22,781
他们咬你的时候你可能还活着。
You could still be alive when they get to your guts.

312
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:28,287
你现在过得不错吧?
You have a good one now, eh?

313
00:46:38,017 --> 00:46:39,918
好,好,好。
Well, well, well.

314
00:46:39,952 --> 00:46:42,988
看看谁来了?
Look what the cat's dragged in, eh?

315
00:46:52,197 --> 00:46:57,002
除非我搞错了，我们不是已经处理好这坨屎了吗?
Unless I'm mistaken didn't we take care of this piece of shit already?

316
00:46:58,103 --> 00:47:00,172
那是我弟弟。
That was my brother.

317
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:01,907
你的兄弟吗?
Your brother?

318
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,376
所以双胞胎吗?
So twins?

319
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,912
你的兄弟,不是吗?
Your brother, eh?

320
00:47:08,147 --> 00:47:13,485
他是个混蛋，罪有应得。
He was a fuckwit who got exactly what he deserved.

321
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:17,856
我要杀了你。
I'm gonna kill ya.

322
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:19,592
不,伴侣。
Nah, mate.

323
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:24,897
不，你唯一要做的就是坐在那里流血直到我他妈的命令你!
No, the only thing you're gonna do is sit there and bleed until I fuckin' say so!

324
00:47:26,432 --> 00:47:28,635
是你在路上撞坏了他们的车。
You were the one that crashed their rig on the road.

325
00:47:28,668 --> 00:47:32,171
你把格蕾西交给了地堡里的那些屠夫。
You gave Gracie to those butchers in the bunker.

326
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:46,385
再一次…马克西还告诉我你救了她的命。
Then again... Maxi also tells me you saved her life.

327
00:47:47,286 --> 00:47:49,288
不过，我还是不知道。
Still, I don't know.

328
00:47:50,523 --> 00:47:53,125
你身上有某种东西。
There's just something about ya.

329
00:47:59,298 --> 00:48:00,667
他的脸。
His face.

330
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,435
我讨厌这张脸!
I hate this face!

331
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:05,505
就是这样。的脸。
That's it. The face.

332

脸是一个真正的问题。
The face is a real problem.

333
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:11,910
我真想把它扯下来吃掉。
I just wanna rip it off and eat the fuckin' thing.

334
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:13,613
你觉得呢，马克西?
What do you think, Maxi?

335
00:48:13,646 --> 00:48:17,182
这家伙是朋友还是狗粮?
Is this guy a friend or is he dog food?

336
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:22,020
狗粮。
Dog food.

337
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:27,694
你说呢，大兵?
What do you say, soldier boy?

338
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:31,997
你是我们的朋友还是我把你的脸咬下来?
You our friend or do I bite your face off?

339
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,700
我是你的朋友。
I'm a friend, yeah.

340
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,467
绝对的朋友。
Definitely the friend.

341
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:36,061
里面有多少人?

346
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,777
如果我们抢先一步，这些都不重要了。
If we get the drop on them, none of that'll matter.

347
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,244
我们将送他们。
We'll take 'em.

348
00:49:53,378 --> 00:49:55,180
Oi。
Oi.

349
00:49:55,214 --> 00:49:58,651
你放了我，我可以保证。

咳嗽得很厉害。

358
00:50:41,193 --> 00:50:43,161

365
00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:27,239
放松。

00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:32,110

——入侵者!-我们被攻击了!

374
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:37,670
在地下掩体里?
Down in the bunkers?

375
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:42,542
我们在他们体内培育一种治疗血清，然后提取出来。
We grow a curative serum inside them and then extract it.

376
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,711
这血清。治疗的人吗?
And this serum. It cures people?

377
00:53:44,744 --> 00:53:47,780
不治疗。管理。这是预防。

防止病毒蔓延

00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:05,230
你应该知道。

384
00:54:09,401 --> 00:54:13,338
我们把它们磨碎，然后把它们变成粉末。
We grind 'em up then convert them to powder form.

385
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:15,373
药片。

386
00:54:15,407 --> 00:54:17,543
我们做药。

387
00:54:49,075 --> 00:54:50,375

走开，我就打爆他的头!
Move and I'll blow his fuckin' head off!

389
00:54:59,952 --> 00:55:07,459
这些……诅咒……他们夺走了我的灵魂。
These... fucks... .. they took my soul.

390
00:55:08,694 --> 00:55:18,403
所以我要和你一起去那个地堡我们要把那些狗娘养的杀个精光。
And so I am gonna go down into that bunker with you and we're gonna kill every last one of those sons-of-bitches.

391
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:23,576
我要弥补这一切。
I gotta make this right.

392
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,585
他妈的。
Fuckin' A.

393
00:55:58,177 --> 00:56:00,680
上校。你还好吗?

397
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:13,659
授予访问权限。
Access granted.

398
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:24,570
啊,上校!要不要来一声?
Ah, Colonel! Care for a toot?

399
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:28,107
没有?不,不。等等!
No? No, no. Wait!

400
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:31,544
事情没那么简单。
It's not that simple.

401
00:56:31,577 --> 00:56:34,013
你不能像我们对其他人那样把她吸出来。
You just can't suck it out of her like we do with the others.

402
00:56:34,046 --> 00:56:36,749
这就像给火箭注入燃料一样。
That would be like injecting rocket fuel.

403
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:42,487
楼上有情况，上校。

404
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:47,693

00:56:52,899 --> 00:56:54,700
花的时间太长了。
It's taking too long.

406
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:56,168
什么是错的。
Something's wrong.

407
00:56:56,202 --> 00:56:58,104
不可能。给它一些时间。
No way. Give it time.

408
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:04,911
我们开始吧。来吧!

409
00:57:16,756 --> 00:57:18,490
好了，开始吧。

请求立即直升机。
