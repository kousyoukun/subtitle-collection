1
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,680
Tell me again
why we're doing this.

2
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,315
Homework, Francis.

3
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,885
- The future's built on it.
- Right.

4
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,593
hey, give me some of that
before you kill it.

5
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,398
you know, last chug
is 89% backwash.

6
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,481
here?

7
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,150
no. you're too close.
move a foot back.

8
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,118
okay.

9
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,821
all right. that's it.
don't move.

10
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,972
- hey, Leatherface?
- what?

11
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,741
- can you really use
that thing?
- what did you say?

12
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,577
can you really use
that thing?

13
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,179
i don't know.
can you really triangulate?

14
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,366
seems like the perfect spot
for deciding what you
really want in life.

15
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,003
my own comic book.
bigger than anything
that marvel or d.c. has.

16
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,338
no. i'm talking about
what you really want right now,

17
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,941
like revenge on the one-legged
bitch in black and white.

18
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:27,515
Margie Flynn!

19
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,916
shit!

20
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,350
shit!

21
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,623
i knew it.

22
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,290
Margie Flynn.

23
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,838
ah, stupid!

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,481
oh!

25
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,531
hmm!

26
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,966
aah!

27
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,774
hey, guys. excuse me.

28
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:30,277
coming through here.
excuse me, excuse me. hello.

29
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,447
aah!

30
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,617
aah! hah!

31
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,185
aah!

32
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,555
aha! huh!

33
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,543
man:
Body of Christ.

34
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,917
are you with me here,
altar boy?

35
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,053
Body of Christ.

36
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,222
Amen.

37
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,160
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

38
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,798
Body of Christ.

39
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,637
Body of Christ.

40
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,972
Amen.

41
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,742
Body of Christ.

42
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,645
Amen.

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,616
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

44
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,761
"you're so sweet.

45
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,096
i think about you
a lot, too."

46
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,098
it's the "too"
that gets me.

47
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,367
that means she knows i was
thinking about her, right?

48
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,236
- how would she know that?
- your obvious boner.

49
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,038
you know what?
give me that.

50
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,174
no. why? why, you gonna
do something about it?

51
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,776
what are you checking out
my ass for?

52
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,510
take the damn note, then. bzz!

53
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,412
but how would she know?

54
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,715
well, maybe it's 'cause
you wrote her a note.

55
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,249
i didn't write her a note.

56
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,786
actually, you're right.
you wrote her a poem.

57
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,454
well, she tried
to kill herself, so you know
she's gotta love poetry,

58
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,091
like sylvia plath
or William Blake, probably.

59
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,126
what are you talking about?
you wrote her a note?

60
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:30,163
no, asshole, it was a poem...
with a note at the end.

61
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,065
- Jesus Christ!
- hey, guys.

62
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,767
- hey. good morning, fellas.
- good morning.

63
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,903

64
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,370
- yeah!

65
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:43,276
so, is anyone going
with Donny Flynn's sister
that you know of?

66
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,079
who, Margie? why?
you think you're gonna
get something off her?

67
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,381
oh, not me.

68
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,918

like, two years ago.

69
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,186
two years? what was she then,
like, 8 years old?

70
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,355
old enough. i mean,
she uses her tongue.

71
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,489
bullshit!

72
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,291
whatever.

73
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,362
i mean, the girl was hungry
and i got some tongue.

74
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,635
girl:
i forgot my homework.

75
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,703

76
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,472

00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,267

98
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,062

100
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,000
- Asskicker.
- yeah, but...

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,903
i thought we were gonna
change the name 'cause
there's 4 of us now.

102
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,805
shut up, Joey.
you don't count.

103
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,540
the guy's got a point.

104
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,509
well, what about you?
you haven't done shit
on this thing.

105
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,244

106
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,046
okay, um, let me show you
something here.

107
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,248
let me educate you
a little bit. look at this.

108
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,250
Tim Sullivan,
the editor.

109
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,253
behind every great book
is a great editor.

110
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,056
- but what's an editor do?
- yeah?

111
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,426
um, basically,
he tells you if you suck,

112
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,761
and, wade, you suck.

113
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,936
- suck?
- well, he doesn't make
any sense, all right?

114
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,804
- Agatha...

115
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,505
all: good morning.

116
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,516
woman:
and hear us, oh, Lord,
as we pray...

117
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,753
- ...for Dottie Baker's safe
recovery from Tonsillitis.

118
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,322
for Keith Bloom
and his family,

119
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,860
as they mourn the loss
of his grandmother, Irene.

120
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,564
and let us pray, o Lord,
for the Sullivans,

121
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,200
as they seek to rebuild
their holy marriage

122
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,936
after struggles
with alcohol, adultery,

123
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,438
and separation.

124
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,480
mr. Sullivan...

125
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,084
when we asked you to repeat
sixth grade two years ago,

126
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,287
we hoped that it would give you
Time to find maturity,

127
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,290
to get you through
a difficult period at home.

128
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,558
now, i'm sure
that you can find
the maturity now

129
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,529
to join us in a prayer
for your family.

130
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,734
o Lord, we ask
all these things in your name.

131
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,971
all: Amen.

132
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,572
math.

133
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,842
yesterday, i asked you
to find a practical use

134
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,378
for your new
measuring skills--

135
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,914
triangulation.

136
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,382
has everyone done
their homework?

137
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,825
all right, boys!
spread it out!

138
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,393
i want to see
some positions!

139
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,263
bet you'd love to say that
to Margie, huh?

140
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,264
shut up.

141
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,832
that's her, isn't it?

142
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,634
she's right there.

143
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,868
wait, isn't that her?

144
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,204
man:
shoot, Flynn! shoot!

145
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,906
lucky save, Sullivan.

146
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,541
lucky? no, i don't think
that was lucky.

147
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,309
you shoot like
your little sister over there.

148
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,978
- man: Sullivan!
- now i'm gonna go this way.

149
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,512
or should i go this way?

150
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,014
Sullivan, it's not
a dance class.

151
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,615
how about this?
how about this?

152
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,453
Jesus h. Christ!

153
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,221
sorry, father.

154
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,558
what does the "h"
stand for?

155
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,363
give me the ball, anderson.

156
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,033
free kick-- white.

157
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,369
Donny Flynn,
back to midfield!

158
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,107
father:
all right, you're bunching up.
you're bunching up.

159
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,441
come on, now.
quit bunching up.

160
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,910
okay, you can go talk
to her now.

161
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,280
go ahead. i got ya.

162
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,915
what are you
waiting for?

163
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,152
she wants you.
she loved your poetry.

164
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,488
you are such
an asshole, Sullivan.

165
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,457
i guess i'm gonna have
to do it myself.

166
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,792
- hey, Margie?
- shut up!

167
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,829
- Francis--

168
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,832
- Doyle, what are you doing?
- nothing, father.

169
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,002
well, do nothing
on the bench.

170
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,406
yeah, yeah.
go do nothing on the bench.

171
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,808
Father:
who's on him?
who's on him?

172
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,943
Boy: come on,
that was a foul!

173
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,578
Sullivan!

174
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,951
Man:
cut the ball hogging!

175
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,187
- boy: get it!

176
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,423
Man: Walter,
you're toeing the ball.

177
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,595
Father:
watch the offsides!

178
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:04,998
hi.

179
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,600
hi.

180
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,371
look, uh, i didn't send
that note.

181
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,474
an ex-friend of mine
did it as a joke.

182
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:19,246
- oh.
- i just wanted you to know
i didn't send it.

183
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,714
i didn't think you did.

184
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,551
well, i didn't.

185
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,762
i'm real sorry.

186
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:39,366
i mean, if i sounded mean
just then.

187
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,570
i was only mad
about the joke.

188
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,641
it's okay. thanks
for being honest, Francis.

189
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,647
i think about you
all the time.

190
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,882
it...

191
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,617
keeps me awake
at night.

192
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,620
i guess you must think
that is really creepy.

193
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,358
do some penalty kicks.

194
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,026
uh, what about this, father?

195
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,262
put it behind your back.
you'll be fine.

196
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,332
hey, that poem
i didn't write--

197
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,368
there's no dirty stuff in it,
is there?

198
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,577
"Margie, Margie,
burning bright,

199
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,679
"in the forests
of the night,

200
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,650
What immortal hand or eye dared
frame thy perfect symmetry?"

201
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,522
that sounds about right.

202
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,492
so, you're into
William Blake?

203
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,462
uh...yeah.

204
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,996
see ya.

205
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,333
bye.

206
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,839
hey.

207
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,575
what's up,
my friend?

208
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,246
- i'll get this.
- all right.

209
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,615
i got the new
"swamp thing" now.

210
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,285
- oh, yeah?
- oh, yeah!

211
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,288
"mirror monster."

212
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,789
tripped me out, man.

213
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,157
- yeah?
- oh, yeah.

214
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,758
cool. thanks.

215
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,727
yeah.

216
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,797
yeah, Major Screw would kill
this guy to death.

217
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,765
yeah, but Major Screw's
weird, man.

218
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,768
i mean, when he's fighting,
he's screwing guys.

219
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,970
Captain Asskicker--
he kicks ass, but--

220
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,740
but Major Screw-- he--
he's screwing guys.

221
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,343
no, no. it's not like a screw.
it's more like a drill.

222
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,977
like it'll spin.

223
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,579
like, get up and just like--

224
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,980
just like
go down on people--

225
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,949
he goes down on people?

226
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,752
- that's sick.
- that's disgusting, man.

227
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,421
i'll just read
my comic book, then.
how about that?

228
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,823
- good idea.
- guys?

229
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,892
we should do a story...
with different episodes.

230
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,161
yeah, we can have one
where, uh...

231
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,163
toilet paper man
meets Captain Asswipe.

232
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,898
Captain Asskicker, asshole.

233
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,302
seriously, maybe the first one
should feature your guy.

234
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,338
mm, nah. see, i'm not sure
about the muscle.

235
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,972
come on, i got him
all worked out.

236
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,107
well, see, the thing is,
i kind of want someone

237
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,343
who's stripped
to their core.

238
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,177
like a skeleton
or something.

239
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,213
- a skeleton?
- yeah.

240
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,582
- it sounds kind of wimpy.
- well, he's not, though.

241
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,083
see, a skeleton
can't be killed.

242
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,253
so he's all bone
and no bullshit.

243
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,988
yeah, but a skeleton's
also dickless.

244
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,490
he's all bone and no skin.

245
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,692
no skin means no dick.

246
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,761
just like you.

247
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,297
that's not true, guys,
'cause there is a bone
in your penis.

248
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,532
that's why they call it
a boner.

249
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:03,270
yeah-- oh, you're right!
you're right, Joey.

250
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,137
- shut up!
- ah! what was that for?

251
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,273
you're an idiot.

252
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,241
- moron.

253
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,742
anyway, if we're
gonna have a story,

254
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,344
then we've got
to have a bad guy.

255
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,280
so who's gonna be
the bad guy?

256
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,763
aah!

257
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,836
kneel and pray, boys.

258
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,444
- huh?

259
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,882
let's kick some ass!

260
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,584
aah!

261
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,885
ugh!

262
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,925
aah! yeah!

263
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,835
- let's waste 'em!

264
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,376
ugh!

265
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,944
aah!

266
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,927
out of the street, dummy!

267
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,236
come back, Bitch!

268
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,873
later, loser!

269
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,729
who are you?

270
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,465
i'm Sorcerella.

271
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,900
this is my kingdom.

272
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,002
ha! you call
this dump a kingdom?

273
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,871
Peg Leg and her evil horde
destroyed it.

274
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,009
this sacred sword must be united
with the Pearl of Wisdom.

275
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,112
only then will my world
be restored to life.

276
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,514
where is this Pearl?

277
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,682
in there,
guarded by Peg Leg.

278
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,718
that's why i need your help.

279
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,855
who's your girlfriend?

280
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,825
i don't have a girlfriend.

281
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:39,992
oh.

282
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,930
dinner's ready.

283
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,798
based on the body, i'd guess
Farrah Fawcett-Majors.

284
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,602
based on the face, though,
i'd say the Flynn girl.

285
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,409
thank you.

286
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,914
so, you decided
to join us?

287
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,750
yeah.

288
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,721
let's pray.

289
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,924
bless us, o Lord,
with these, Thy gifts,

290
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,893
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

291
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,361
through Christ
our Lord, Amen.

292
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,530
all: Amen.

293
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,632
* someone's singing,
my Lord *

294
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,101
* Kumbaya *

295
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,370
* someone's singing,
my Lord *

296
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,905
* Kumbaya *

297
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,674
look at this.
it's incredible.

298
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,743
He wrote it, he drew it,
he printed it.

299
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,080
He did whatever he wanted.
listen to this.

300
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,383
"The nakedness of woman
is the work of God."

301
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,919
* Kumbaya *

302
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,088
* someone's praying,
my Lord *

303
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,524
now, see how his painting
describes his writing?

304
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,226
* someone's praying,
my Lord *

305
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,328
- * Kumbaya *
- "This is the marriage
of Heaven and Hell."

306
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,765
* oh, Lord, Kumbaya *

307
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,001
* someone's crying,
my Lord *

308
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,836
there's no writing
on this one.

309
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,738
is that God
triangulating?

310
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,573
yeah, probably.

311
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,610
show me whatever that is.

312
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,314
- it's my dad's, Sister.
- William Blake.

313
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,250
a little advanced,
Mr. Sullivan,
don't you think?

314
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,152
um, not really, Sister.

315
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,454
it's written simply enough
for a 6-year-old.

316
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,224
so are the instructions
for a handgun.

317
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,528
Blake is a very dangerous
thinker. now give it to me.

318
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:24,997
you should forgive him that,
Sister, 'cause he was a genius.

319
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,699
give it to me.

320
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,511
Sullivan, front of the bus.

321
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,363
* someone's singing,
my Lord *

322
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,632
* Kumbaya *

323
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,134
* someone's singing,
my Lord *

324
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,870
* Kumbaya *

325
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,739
* someone's singing,
my Lord *

326
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,075
* Kumbaya *

327
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,712
woman: yeah, that's a very
thoughtful question.

328
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,182
the head of the sexually
aroused adult gobbler

329
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:21,320
can change into
a variety of shades
of red, white, and blue.

330
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,389
yeah, it's a patriotic bird.

331
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,093
in fact, it was supposed
to be the bird of our nation

332
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:31,163
until the, uh, bald eagle
got the most votes.

333
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:36,102
yeah. that's it
for the turkeys.

334
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,014
oh, ho! we're in luck today.
he's just been fed.

335
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,082
it's not often
that he's out like this,

336
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,052
where we can see him so well.

337
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:57,056
some folks call them cougars,
or panthers.

338
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,660
different name,
same mountain lion.

339
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,395
yeah, they used to rule
this country.

340
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:07,667
they're, uh, not much use to us
and our technological world,

341
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,202
but, uh, then again,
we're not much use to...

342
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,071
the lady's smoked a few joints
in her life.

343
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,073
Woman: people killed them
because they were dangerous.

344
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,308
Tim:
that animal sees
something in me.

345
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,778
yeah, lunch.

346
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,180
woman: ...automobiles,
nuclear plants and all.

347
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,218
yeah. any questions?

348
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,055
do you think an animal
like that has a soul?

349
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,890
we're taught that they don't.

350
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,825
that's a very
thoughtful question.

351
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:37,864
i don't know. i do know
that they're incapable of sin.

352
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:41,200
even when an animal kills,
it's in innocence.

353
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,203
all right, back to the bus.

354
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,406
- come along.
- hey, look at that.

355
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,077
he seems to be
tracking our teacher,
Sister Assumpta.

356
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,345
is that because she's moving,
or-- or is it possible

357
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:58,617
that he's locked on to her
particular scent or something?

358
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:03,255
that's a very
thoughtful question.

359
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:07,827
predators have a variety of ways
that they can just hone in

360
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,829
on their prey and then just--

361
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,099
- take them out.
- like that.

362
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:17,236
yeah, all we got to do
is capture the cougar
and put it in Assumpta's office.

363
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,439
- why?
- because she's gonna think
she's been tracked.

364
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,841
she's gonna wet her wimple.

365
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,776
wimple? what's that?

366
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,411
Jesus! you don't know
what a wimple is?

367
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,513
the cops would just shoot it.

368
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,282
the cops aren't gonna shoot it.
it's an endangered species.

369
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,251
we could get
in serious trouble, man.

370
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,321
- serious trouble beats
serious boredom.

371
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,957
- you want to move a 200-pound
cougar from here to school?
- mm-hmm.

372
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,827
- how are we gonna do that?
- yeah.

373
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,465
that's a very
thoughtful question.

374
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:57,009
so, you're interested
in souls and stuff?

375
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,311
- souls and stuff?

376
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,080
you asked the ranger?

377
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,382
i mean-- i mean,
i like your question.

378
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,885
oh, yeah. thanks.

379
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,795
do want to meet me
tomorrow night after dinner?

380
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,231
tomorrow night?
yeah. where?

381
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,901
- i don't know.
- Assumpta: find your partner.

382
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,636
the oak tree
on castle street?

383
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,605
- okay.
- come on, you two.

384
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,948
those pinheads--
i thought they were cool.

385
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,117
but the best part
was the siamese twins.

386
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,052
i mean, she was making out
with that one guy,

387
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,822
and then the Sister felt...
that was really cool.

388
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,390
hey, you guys,
i found something

389
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,425
that feels just like
the real thing.

390
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,927
yeah, really?

391
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,729
yeah. a warm washcloth
and lots of soap.

392
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,431
i tried that
beating-off crap once.

393
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,766
oh, just once, wade?

394
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,770
yeah, just once...asshole.

395
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,150
Tim: all right,
i'm thinking blowgun.

396
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,552
now, i can tag the cat
with an anesthetic dart.

397
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,554
no?

398
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,289
all right, does anyone else
have an idea?

399
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,325
where would you get
that kind of anesthetic?

400
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:22,962
- uh, probably a drug store.
- a drug store?

401
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,564
- well, what about the fence?
- wire cutters.

402
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,100
we can just cut a flap in
the chain link, and we can
just pull it through.

403
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,269
nah. it'll be too obvious
the thing was stolen.

404
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,104
i thought that the whole point
was to make Assumpta think

405
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,240
it tracked her
back to school.

406
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,708
- well, we can just put
the chain link back.
- no, Tim.

407
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,846
we're gonna take the cat
over the fence.

408
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,881
can you dig it?

409
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:44,951
oh, i can dig it.

410
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,687
- more-- more in this one.
- hey, hey, hey.

411
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,322
lining 'em up,
lining 'em up.

412
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,059
Francis...and Joey.
i'm cutting you off.

413
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,861
you've had
a little bit too much.

414
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,964
you're not getting
your cigarette, then.

415
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,799
- sorry, man.
- i'm tending bar here. relax.

416
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,234
you can see her nipples.

417
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,536
that's the point
of the magazine.

418
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,138
dude, what are you doing?

419
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:09,208
i forgot it was your dad's.
i'm sorry.

420
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:24,456
we had hoped

421
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,625
that you would help
join us in prayer

422
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,694
for your family.

423
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,930
or that.

424
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,299
wait, wait. like--

425
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,234
whoa!

426
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,468
Yee-Hah!

427
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:42,308
hey, Joey, didn't you say
something about a rag with soap?

428
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,742
yeah.

429
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,145
looks like i found
your girlfriend, big guy.

430
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,779
come here,
you got a date.

431
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,017
whoo!

432
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,972
thank you
and good night!

433
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,106
check it out.

434
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,475
101 ways
to kill a nun.

435
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,380
i am a sick monkey.

436
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,581
yes, you are.

437
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,929
Tim: you guys up
for a delicious treat?

438
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,764
Anchovies!

439
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,232
that's disgusting.

440
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,767
it'll rid you
of the booze breath.

441
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,502
Joey, you're first.

442
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,337
- i hate these things.
- oh, you love 'em.

443
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,206
hey, Francis,
you don't go anywhere.

444
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,008
you're gonna need
one of these.

445
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,442
no, thanks.

446
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,045
really?
you gonna live dangerously?

447
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,881
something like that.

448
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,486
where the hell's
he going?

449
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,754
ugh! thanks.
they're disgusting.

450
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,923
oh...

451
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,200
Margie: Francis.

452
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,036
hey.

453
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,504
hey.

454
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,275
so, you want to go someplace?
i know a place.

455
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,677
- yeah.
- okay. come on.

456
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,417
so, we stole
a couple of valiums
from Jimmy's mom

457
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,452
and put them
in the communion wine.

458
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,322
Father Casey didn't get
to the end of the mass
that morning.

459
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,424
he just nodded off.

460
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,392
God, that's such a freak-out.

461
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,595
yeah. that was one
of Tim's crazy ideas.

462
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,465
those are the only kinds
of ideas Tim has.

463
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,801
Tim. he's the one that sent me
the poem, isn't he?

464
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,471
right. but...

465
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:56,508
but it didn't turn out
to be too crazy, did it?

466
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,410
nope.

467
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,649
it's this way.

468
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,223
what is this place?

469
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,725
oh, i used to take
piano lessons here
when i was younger.

470
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,161
i sucked.

471
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:18,230
but it's been empty
for a while.

472
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:48,160
i think it's like film
or records, you know--

473
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,497
stuff that takes
an imprint.

474
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,299
well, wouldn't it be so cool

475
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,301
if a person's spirit
was so strong

476
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,503
it could just leave
an imprint behind?

477
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:01,973
hard to see,
but it's there, you know?

478
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,475
yeah.

479
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,344
like those japanese people
whose shadows

480
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:09,815
got burned onto the walls
by the atom bomb.

481
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:13,619
well, maybe i should believe
in ghosts, then.

482
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,398
my house
is sort of haunted.

483
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,167
there was this woman
who died there

484
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,602
before my family
bought it, and...

485
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:35,474
sometimes, i wake up
and i see her come in.

486
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:39,711
she sort of just hangs out
at the foot of my bed.

487
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,448
do you get scared?

488
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,216
no.

489
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,226
do you think i'm crazy?

490
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,366
when you look at me...

491
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,236
i can hardly breathe.

492
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,279
your heart's so loud.

493
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,880
yeah?

494
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,750
my lips are numb.

495
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,758
no, they aren't.

496
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,901
we should go soon.

497
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,472
i gotta get home.

498
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,876
hey, next time,

499
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,279
bring some of whatever
you've been drinking.

500
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,324
- you ready?
- yes.

501
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,900
hang on.

502
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,340
where do you guys
come from?

503
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,277
We're outcasts.
We don't belong anywhere.

504
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,549
- cozy ride?
- well, once we've
accomplished our mission

505
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,851
and the sword is back
with the Pearl,

506
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,822
My kingdom will be restored
and this could be your home.

507
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,425
who cares?
let's go get Peg Leg.

508
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,094
i feel like kicking
a nasty habit.

509
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,997
Time to swing
into action.

510
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,010
i'm not asking you
"did you feel her up?"
or "did you see her tits?"

511
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,313
those are Wade questions.

512
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:32,684
you gotta tell me
about this, man.
i suck with girls.

513
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,120
don't even tell those guys
i'm seeing her, all right?

514
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,790
anything you tell me
about Margie stays
right here. honest.

515
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,927
like i said,
it was great.

516
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,797
she's great.

517
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,000
come on,
get your ass over here.
help me with this.

518
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,006
so...

519
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,409
did you feel her up?

520
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,878
let's take this thing
for a test run.

521
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,158
Francis:
man, she's really heavy.

522
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,493
yeah, i know.

523
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,396
- you said she was hollow.
- i did?

524
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,130
let's pull her, okay?

525
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,632
all right.

526
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,373
oh, shit!

527
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,341
hold on, man.

528
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,478
come on.

529
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,090
we got it.

530
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,865
- Shit!
- oh!

531
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,768
Ugh!

532
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,303
- oh, shit!
- SHIT!

533
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:03,542
- what are you doing?

534
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,559
Assumpta: Mary, Full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art Thou among women.

535
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,094
blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

536
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,631
Damn.

537
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,035
a little lower.

538
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,537
oh, shit.

539
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,140
- oh, shit!
- oh, sh--

540
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,044
what's with them?

541
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,516
it's Father Casey. shit.

542
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,720
oh, shit! shit!

543
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,589
- shit! shit!
- just hold on.

544
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,758
- what do you think i'm doing?
- shh!

545
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,445
come on. he's gone.

546
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,526
Sister, i'm sorry about
interrupting your devotions.

547
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:30,028
i was almost done, Father.

548
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,430
- we should put her back.

549
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,899
What?

550
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,667
we're blown, man.
come on, let's pull.

551
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,135
no way. no.

552
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,912
Ugh!

553
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,714
we're gonna have
to drop her, then.

554
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,985
you're not gonna do
that whole stack tonight,
are you, Sister?

555
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,121
well, i have to keep
on top of it every day,

556
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,757
or by tomorrow, there'll
be twice as much damage.

557
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,326
Shit. can't you just anchor
the rope or something?

558
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,496
yeah, okay. you sit here
and relax, and i'll go
anchor it for you.

559
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,464
could tie it to your dick
if you want.

560
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,366
they're my children.

561
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,868
bright bunch.

562
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,069
okay.

563
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,704
you're right.
let's drop her.

564
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,405
but it's a troubled world
out there.

565
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,707
on the count of three.

566
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:16,908
and i'm here to make sure

567
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,109
that they're ready for it.

568
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,711
1, 2, 3!

569
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,218
what are you doing?

570
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,588
just as i planned.

571
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,925
move!

572
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,700
i burned the skin
off my hands.

573
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,468
i can barely curl
my fingers now.

574
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,537
- there goes your sex life.

575
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,773
shut up.

576
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:50,576
- to Agatha.
- to Agatha.

577
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,648
Tim: i'm telling you,

578
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,449
the whole world is stupider
than we are.

579
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:02,253
it'll be weeks
before anyone notices
she's gone. weeks.

580
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,523
this is an insult...

581
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,795
not only to the school...

582
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:12,664
but to the spirit
of Saint Agatha herself,

583
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:16,367
whose rueful martyrdom
at pagan hands

584
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,370
is deserving of reverence...

585
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,774
not desecration.

586
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,120
so, tonight we should
get something

587
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,823
- that'll knock out the cougar.
- tonight?

588
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:41,059
i can't tonight.
tomorrow night...maybe.

589
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,294
what is this,
four nights in a row now?

590
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:50,101
well, i'm no expert,
so you gotta tell me.

591
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,837
how many days
is this gonna take?

592
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:53,939
another one.

593
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,042
see you.

594
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,190
what's in that again?

595
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,493
Bourbon and Gin...

596
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,395
Vodka...

597
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:51,863
Rum...

598
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,633
White wine,
Frangelico...

599
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,402
whenever my dad
opens a bottle,

600
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,470
i skim some...

601
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,007
for emergencies.

602
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,341
so, am i an emergency?

603
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,110
kind of.

604
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,881
you know, you're...

605
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,950
you're all i think about.

606
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,219
so you don't think
about Wade, huh?

607
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,889
he claims he kissed you,
i mean, like, when you were 12.

608
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:24,696
does that...
bother you a lot?

609
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,399
no.

610
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,435
not too much.

611
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,437
'cause...

612
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:36,007
'cause i've done
a lot of stuff
worse than that.

613
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,745
what?

614
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,284
you'd hate me.

615
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,685
no fooling.

616
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,155
that's why i tried
to kill myself.

617
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,858
what?

618
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:02,801
i used to let Donny
do things to me.

619
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,737
you know?

620
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,808
everything.

621
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,943
who's Donny?

622
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,751
Donny...your brother?

623
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,360
He did it
a lot of times.

624
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,330
i was just confused.

625
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:37,568
then i started feeling sick
and i couldn't sleep.

626
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:42,774
i even felt like
i was possessed or something.

627
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,949
i guess i'll go to hell
about twice over.

628
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,119
i don't believe
there is a hell.

629
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,369
i gotta go.

630
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,976
look, i'm just gonna
stay here for a while.

631
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,914
okay.

632
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:52,210
woman on tv:
good afternoon.
Mr. Kitzmiller's office.

633
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,037
good afternoon.
Mr. Kitzmiller's office.

634
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,106
well, he's not in
at the moment.

635
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,351
Mr. Duckery...

636
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,953
Mr. Scalisi...

637
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:37,522
Mr. Gibbney,
Mr. Flynn...

638
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,789
Mr. Doyle...

639
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,658
and, of course,
Mr. Sullivan.

640
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,293
the rest are dismissed.

641
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:56,874
I am very disappointed

642
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,310
that the statue
has not been returned.

643
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:04,049
and i would like to ask
for your boys' help
in this matter.

644
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,750
now, i'm not saying
that any of you

645
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,852
are responsible for this.

646
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,387
Mr. Scalisi,

647
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:13,358
you're more of a--
of a talker than a doer.

648
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:14,993
Mr. Doyle,

649
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,495
you're more of a follower
than a leader.

650
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:23,701
Mr. Sullivan...

651
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,136
well, frankly,
i don't think that you're...

652
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,538
smart enough for this one.

653
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,676
since all of you have been
in trouble before,

654
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,979
i can't imagine that
you would be foolish enough

655
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:35,513
to be a part of this.

656
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:39,417
but make no mistake...

657
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:43,121
the culprits
will be fingered.

658
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,423
i will finger the culprits.

659
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:50,328
dismissed.

660
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:52,330
Tim: if she's upset
about the statue,

661
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,433
she's gonna freak out
when she sees the cougar.

662
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,276
hey, man. i'm out.

663
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,744
yeah, sorry, man.
we can't help you.

664
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,379
- yeah.
- no.

665
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,015
that which doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

666
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:13,318
- well, that's a crock.
- that's bullshit, man.

667
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:19,057
ah, they're morons.

668
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:20,591
let's just go.

669
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,507
yeah.

670
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,320
so, we're still on
for tomorrow night, right?

671
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,056
you can tell your parents
you're with me

672
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:53,258
and ditto, vice versa.

673
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:55,593
- okay.
- oh, don't forget
the wire cutters.

674
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:57,362
okay.

675
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,198
what's the matter
with you?

676
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,999
i'm fine.

677
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,545
okay, let's go.

678
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:27,092
and...charge!

679
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,902
no!

680
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,413
ugh! ahh!

681
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,415
over here, Bigfoot!

682
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:58,523
shit, we just lost Screw
and Asskicker.

683
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,938
- aaah!

684
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,574
- oh, no!

685
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:19,477
- i gotta go help her.
- okay.

686
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:20,811
go.

687
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,121
look out!

688
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,892
aaaaaah!

689
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,484
Margie: Francis?

690
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:18,369
the first few Times,
i felt smarter...

691
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,405
than everyone else.

692
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:23,608
sort of dangerous.

693
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,713
do you know that feeling?

694
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,783
yeah.

695
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,591
then i just started feeling
like a monster.

696
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:45,330
look, i was going crazy
keeping it secret.

697
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,898
i had to tell you.

698
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,402
and i have been practicing
what to say

699
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,704
ever since we met.

700
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,909
don't hurt yourself.

701
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,216
you hate me.

702
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,385
no.

703
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,154
i'm just...

704
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:13,324
i don't know.

705
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,192
i don't know.

706
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:19,397
look, what are you
doing tonight?

707
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,300
i'm doing something...

708
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,802
with Tim.

709
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,739
i mean...

710
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,310
i'd ask you
to come along, but...

711
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,645
it's kind of secret.

712
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:42,920
you can come...

713
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,892
if you want to.

714
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:32,403
aren't you even gonna
ask me if i'm pissed?

715
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,987
here.

716
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,589
this way.

717
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,163
you did bring
your wire cutters, right?

718
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,698
no.

719
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,765
there he is.

720
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:36,901
do you guys see him?

721
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:38,369
he's right there.

722
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,772
let's go.

723
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,818
see, if we get him
right there,

724
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:58,055
where he usually eats,
he's in easy blowgun reach.

725
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,590
once he goes down,
we're gonna have
to wait a few minutes

726
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,091
to make sure it's cool.

727
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,393
and then we go in together.

728
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,661
- okay?
- okay.

729
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,796
- oh...

730
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,331
this chain's
bad news, though.

731
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:08,966
it's no big deal.

732
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:11,502
we can cut a link,
and after, press it back.

733
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,237
all we're gonna need
is bolt cutters.

734
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,707
- and a vise.
- and a gag
for your girlfriend.

735
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,410
- she won't say anything.
- how do you know?

736
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,512
'cause i know.

737
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,736
so what are you doing
next weekend?

738
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:48,539
i don't know.

739
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,074
'cause my Mom's
going out of town,

740
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,510
and my Dad's supposed
to take us,

741
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,244
but i'm sure he won't, so...

742
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,413
i just wish you could
find a way to come over

743
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,949
and watch for the ghost
with me.

744
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,521
if you want.

745
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:13,831
Sullivan?

746
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,968
take this to Mrs. burns.
she's in the parish hall.

747
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,537
- yes, Father.
- Francis...

748
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,572
i could use a hand.

749
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,512
okay.

750
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,013
okay.

751
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,889
something on your mind?

752
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,027
usually, uh...

753
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:46,697
when you're
talking about sin

754
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:48,533
and forgiving it
and all, um,

755
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,268
i'm going, "yeah, okay.
who cares?"

756
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,573
'cause i didn't really know
what you were talking about.

757
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,342
but...

758
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,344
but now i do.

759
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,582
was it a venial
or a mortal sin?

760
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:07,518
- i don't know.

761
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,924
you'll be fine.

762
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,826
just let your faith
guide you,

763
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:19,363
even if your body
tells you otherwise.

764
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:23,634
think of the Lord's prayer
if you're tempted.

765
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,340
thank you, Father.

766
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,677
sure.

767
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:51,095
all right.
so i figured it out,
in case you care.

768
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:53,463
for a 120-pound animal
like that,

769
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:55,600
we're gonna need
about a quart of Nyquil.

770
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,368
that's, like, 20 bottles
or something.

771
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,937
right.

772
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,539
right?
what do you mean, "right"?

773
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:04,942
i mean, yeah.

774
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,782
whoo!

775
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,550
will you quit
with that kung fu crap?

776
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,620
no.

777
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,399
master! i can feel it.

778
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,102
i no longer be Grasshopper.

779
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:36,273
Jesus! what's with you?

780
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,743
look, this is serious,
so quit fucking around.

781
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:40,678
who's fucking around?

782
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:44,214
you think this
will hold a cougar?

783
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,984
well, if by some chance
it wakes up before we
get it to the school--

784
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:50,420
oh, yeah,
if the cherry-flavored Nyquil
doesn't keep it snoozing away,

785
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,224
well, then, this incredible
cage will hold him.

786
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:57,094
right? get real, Tim.

787
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,666
get fucking real.

788
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,768
to hell with you.

789
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:06,671
see you later.

790
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:23,888
not everyone has to make up
trouble for themselves

791
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:27,091
just so they're not bored.

792
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,960
at least, i'm doing something.

793
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,930
what are you doing, Francis?
what exactly do you do?

794
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,032
have you done anything
with Margie yet?

795
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:37,234
you don't know
anything about that.

796
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:39,737
so you haven't done anything
with Margie. how about i go
write you another note

797
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:43,473
so that you can have a lot
more time making up shit
like this?

798
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,521
so what's the matter?
is she getting freaky on you?

799
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,124
it's a secret,
Goddamn it!

800
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,678
you're bleeding.

801
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,886
she told me a secret.

802
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,189
it's not a regular secret.

803
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,895
not normal.

804
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,266
you could never tell anyone.

805
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:47,337
anyone.

806
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:53,543
uh, that doesn't really mean
anything about Margie.

807
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,212
she's kind of cool...

808
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,647
not ordinary...

809
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,049
you know,
in a cool sort of way.

810
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:02,352
Edgar Allan Poe did it
with his cousin.

811
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,822
and i forgive him that,
of course...

812
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:06,656
because he was a genius.

813
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,823
how about you,
Mr. Gibbney?

814
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:43,060
you're something
of a...class gossip.

815
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,229
do you know anything
about this?

816
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:47,397
no, Sister.

817
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,605
Mr. Sullivan?

818
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,375
i've never seen
that before.

819
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:05,149
Mr. Doyle?

820
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:07,151
Frankly,
this kind of crudity

821
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,553
isn't really
your style, now, is it?

822
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:12,422
no, Sister.

823
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,991
Francis...

824
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,326
do you know anything
about our Saint Agatha?

825
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,197
- yes, Father.
- good.

826
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,267
tell us what you know.

827
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,372
she was really good-looking,
and she promised God
she'd be a virgin,

828
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,440
but then some guy
wanted to marry her,
and when she wouldn't,

829
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,976
- stop it! stop it!
- he took her in a brothel.

830
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:33,577
and then he cut
her breasts off.

831
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:36,013
i won't tolerate
any more disrespect from you.

832
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,282
now, you confess.
you tell us why you did this.

833
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:40,484
actually, i heard
that he branded her--

834
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,252
you hold your tongue,
young man!

835
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:45,022
you are on a terrible
downward spiral.

836
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,625
he sees in your heart.
he knows what you do.

837
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,160
i fear for you.

838
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,964
boys...

839
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:56,766
Church property
was stolen...

840
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,603
and now,
apparently, damaged.

841
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:03,073
we had hoped to have
the statue back by now.

842
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:07,945
we expect it back
immediately.

843
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:11,581
we don't want to have
to call the police.

844
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,851
you're dismissed.
straight to classes.

845
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,958
whew.

846
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,485
* well, i'm so tired
of crying *

847
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:51,021
* but i'm on
the road again *

848
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:54,158
hey, how do you aim
this thing?

849
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:56,226
* well, i'm so tired
of crying *

850
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,996
* but i'm on
the road again *

851
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:01,131
* i'm on the road again *

852
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,100
* i ain't got no woman *

853
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,734
be the dart.

854
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:08,305
- how much is that?
- that's his third helping.

855
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,907
or, roughly,
an amount that would get
into his bloodstream

856
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,743
if we hit him
with 160 darts.

857
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,879
* in the rain and snow *

858
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:19,516
- plan b?
- plan b.

859
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,919
* in the rain and snow *

860
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,154
hello?

861
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,993
- you know his name?
- no, don't you?

862
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:34,999
Hello?

863
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,735
hey, it's
the altar boys.

864
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,704
here to get altered?

865
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:42,772
okay.

866
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,574
y'all got the money?

867
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,610
uh, yeah.

868
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,080
you got
the illegal substance?

869
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,548
oh, yeah.

870
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,951
it's there.

871
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,788
oh...

872
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,357
y-yes.

873
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,962
that's it?

874
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,631
that's all?

875
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,699
man, that's enough
to melt an elephant.

876
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:13,037
excuse my friend.
he-- he thinks he wants
to melt 2 elephants.

877
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:15,105
mm-hmm.

878
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,109
y'all want
to smoke a roach?

879
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,578
- oh, yeah, sure. okay.
- okay.

880
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:23,013
yeah.

881
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,628
- it looks like a rat turd.

882
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,203
tastes like one, too.

883
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,314
i am brachion.

884
01:01:57,314 --> 01:02:00,084
God, come save us now.

885
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:03,720
you're wrestling with it, man.
just let it take you away.

886
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:38,655
oh, shit.
it's been hit.

887
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:42,226
- it's still alive.

888
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:45,329
somebody's got to help it.

889
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,231
they got to come
and get it.

890
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:49,966
they? there is no "they."

891
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,568
we are "they."

892
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,575
- oh, Jesus, Tim.

893
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:01,611
no, it's okay.
i got it.

894
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:04,814
hey, Tim,
where are you going with it?

895
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,150
it's practically dead.

896
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,586
i'm just going away
from here.

897
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,658
- come on, Tim.
- no.

898
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,662
it's gonna die.

899
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:22,699
it looks dead.

900
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:25,235
i-i think it's dead.

901
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:46,122
no one was coming for this dog.
i hope you realize that.

902
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,161
nobody around here,
nobody who passed it,

903
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,930
not even the guy
who hit it.

904
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,799
i hope you realize that.

905
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,843
don't you ever tell me
to get real.

906
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,582
i know what
fucking real is, okay?

907
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,819
okay.

908
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,272
- Ugh!
- leave her!

909
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,641
i have to get her
to the Pearl.

910
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,510
we gotta find Peg Leg.

911
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,651
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

912
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,455
you know,
forget this feeble flesh.

913
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,657
i'm doing skeleton boy.

914
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,526
Aah!

915
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:07,170
Aaaah!

916
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:40,970
Hey.

917
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,239
- Hey.

918
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,380
let go, Donny!

919
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:13,670
i got this, too.
every song is good.

920
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,838
yeah.

921
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:16,406
yeah. if you sit
on the bed,

922
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:18,675
the sound echoes
in this weird way.

923
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:20,444
* round, round,
up and down *

924
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:25,281
* all along
the lonely town *

925
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:28,585
- * see him sinking low *
- it's like you're inside it.

926
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,487
yeah, this is the best spot.

927
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,457
* doesn't see the joy
there is to know *

928
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,993
* and he cries *

929
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,196
* from the misery *

930
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,199
* and he lies *

931
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,768
you sure smell good.

932
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,172
* she is gone *

933
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,342
* there is no tomorrow *

934
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,177
* it is done *

935
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:57,881
Donny: Margie!
where's the damn spaghetti?

936
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,049
i cooked it!
make something else!

937
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,818
there's beans and franks!

938
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,489
ignore him.

939
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:08,358
* ...must do *

940
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,496
* for the others *

941
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,632
i think i'm ugly
and i'm awful,

942
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,501
and i don't know
why you came here.

943
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,636
no, you're not.

944
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:22,406
do you think
i lied about the ghost
to get you here?

945
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:25,442
- i didn't come here
because of the ghost.
- she's real.

946
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,611
all right?
either she's real...

947
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:29,946
or i'm crazy.

948
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:35,519
i'm so scared of being crazy
that i'm going crazy.

949
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,488
* i thought i saw a trace *

950
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:40,757
- don't!

951
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,326
there isn't
any beans and franks.

952

* from the misery *

956
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,541
* and the lies *

957
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,644
* singing harmony *

958
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:04,080
* she is gone *

959
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,016
* there is no tomorrow *

960
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,886
* it is done *

961
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:13,923
* so now he must borrow *

962

* the life of his brothers *

963
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,696
* and living in sorrow *

964
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,665
* must do *

965
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,936
see, i tried to do
the constellations.

966
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,641
that's Orion.

967
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:40,784
Francis, tell me
the most amazing thing
you've ever heard.

968
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:51,628
there's this fish...

969
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,932
that lives at the bottom
of the ocean...

970
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:59,536
and it has a spine
sticking out of its head...

971
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:02,105
to lure prey.

972
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:04,641
the females
are the glowing ones.

973
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,443
the males are smaller.

974
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:11,515
after the male fish hatch,
they bite on to the female.

975
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:14,584
they're like parasites.

976
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:21,558
but after a while,
they grow into each other,

977
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:24,528
and they share the same blood
and everything.

978
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:27,797
they turn
into one single fish.

979
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,468
wow.

980
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,505
that's really weird.

981
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:01,284
we've made it.
we've made it to the Pearl.

982
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:38,822
so...

983
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:41,024
what'd you do last night?

984
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:45,061
we didn't do anything.

985
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:46,863
well, if you feel
that's sin,

986
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,799
i still think i deserve
to know the specifics.

987
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:52,101
we didn't do anything
but listen to music.

988
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,003
music--
that sounds good.

989
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:56,172
what'd you listen to?

990
01:12:56,172 --> 01:12:58,307
ooh! oh, Francis! mmm!

991
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:01,010
- oh, i can't take it. aah!

992
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,079
you laugh, but i'm right.

993
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,782
ah, Francis the man.

994
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:10,686
- come on, pass it.
- come on!

995
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,355
- put it in the middle.
- right here.

996
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:15,391
come on, boys.

997
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,563
we've got a few minutes left.
we're gonna finish up
with some headings.

998
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:25,468
dummy in the middle.
i'm gonna pair you up.
Smith...Roosevelt.

999
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,536
Doyle...dockery.

1000
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,038
Anderson...Floyd.

1001
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:31,674
Sullivan...Flynn.

1002
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:35,244
the rest of you boys over here.
barnes, you're in the middle.
let's go! hustle!

1003
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,445
come on, boys!

1004
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:44,487
all right,
hurry up, spaz. come on.

1005
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:49,025
- okay.
- ow.

1006
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:51,227
what's wrong with you?
why can't you get it?

1007
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,966
all right, what was wrong
with that one?

1008
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:59,035
i think
it was a little high.

1009
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,703
it's not too--
it's not too high.

1010
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:04,107
- you just need to jump for it.
- okay, i'll jump for it.

1011
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:05,474
oh!

1012
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:07,944
is that low enough for you?

1013
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,980
not as low as fucking
your own sister.

1014
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:17,153
Casey:
okay, come here, boys.

1015
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:19,255
let's go.
let's take it in.

1016
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:25,728
let's go!

1017
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:27,063
what the hell
happened to you?

1018
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,368
i screwed up.

1019
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:36,439
i let Donny know...

1020
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:38,541
that i know
about him and Margie.

1021
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:40,743
you what?

1022
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:44,113
i'm sorry.
i had to tell someone
just like you had to.

1023
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:46,983
only, i had no one to tell,
so i kept it in, and...

1024
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,052
it just came out.

1025
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:51,487
it came out to Donny?

1026
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,688
yeah.

1027
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:55,091
how stupid are you?

1028
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,895
you're on your own, Tim.

1029
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,064
you're on your fucking own.

1030
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:42,605
it's not important
how i got this.

1031
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:44,941
what is important...

1032
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:46,943
is that it is...

1033
01:15:46,943 --> 01:15:48,311
Disgusting.

1034
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:52,148
Blasphemous enough
for a lifeTime.

1035
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:55,484
never in my life
have i seen anything...

1036
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,954
so...vile...

1037
01:15:57,954 --> 01:16:01,490
and cruel and insulting.

1038
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:07,663
you are suspended
immediately...

1039
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,299
expulsion pending.

1040
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,303
i'll call
your parents on monday

1041
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,872
to discuss your removal
from school.

1042
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:23,980
i don't know
how to get through
to you boys.

1043
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,816
i will pray...

1044
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:29,785
for your guidance.

1045
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,655
and i suggest
that you spend the weekend...

1046
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:34,157
doing the same.

1047
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:16,132
i was gonna tell you.

1048
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,767
- it all just happened.
- i'm the bad one.

1049
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:22,771
all right, you can hate Donny
and think he's an evil asshole,

1050
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:25,674
but i made him do it.

1051
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,911
i-i tricked him one night
when he was stoned,

1052
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:31,347
and then i blackmailed him
into doing it all the Time.

1053
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,719
and i loved it.

1054
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,587
it was all
i thought about.

1055
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:43,926
all right, there.

1056
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:46,996
it's the whole truth,
all right? now you can hate me.

1057
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:50,599
- i don't hate you.
- well, why don't you
go tell Tim?

1058
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,642
have you gone
through all of this?

1059
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:01,477
no-- well...

1060
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:03,046
briefly.

1061
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,761
is this supposed to be me?

1062
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:19,995
yes, and that's...

1063
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,530
supposed to be me.

1064
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,523
so...

1065
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:49,792
did Assumpta like
your stupid comic book?

1066
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,395
she recognized herself.

1067
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,663
i'll bet that means you're
a pretty good artist, huh?

1068
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:57,933
i'm not getting into it
with you, Donny. i'm sorry.

1069
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:01,437
- call it even.
- even?

1070
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:03,806
oh, no,
we're not fucking even!

1071
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,775
come on, superhero!

1072
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:39,408
aaah!

1073
01:19:56,692 --> 01:19:58,361
aah!

1074
01:20:00,163 --> 01:20:01,664

1075
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:03,232

1076
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:06,502

1077
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:07,570

1078
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:10,206
skeleton boy...

1079
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:12,775
where are you?

1080
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:18,013
ha!

1081
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,486
no!

1082
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:44,273
look, Sugarfoot, he gave us
the deed to his house.

1083
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:48,277
man on tv:
the old-timer give the deed
to that woodpecker.

1084
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:50,646
Francis, Joey's here.

1085
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:52,848
hi, Mr. Doyle.

1086
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,817
hello, Joey.

1087
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:56,285
where you going?

1088
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:58,287
just outside.

1089
01:20:58,287 --> 01:21:00,823
no further
than the driveway.

1090
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:02,325
okay.

1091
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:04,227
i mean it.

1092
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,534
Tim told us to meet here.

1093
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:12,835
Tim?

1094
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:17,540
Jesus, Doyle,
what happened to your face?

1095
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,141
i fell off my bike.

1096
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:21,544
what's up, Francis?

1097
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:23,078
how's it going
with Margie?

1098
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,179
get there yet?

1099
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,249
tongue.

1100
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:27,216
told you.

1101
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,652
hey, everybody.

1102
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,422
ooh, nice shot.

1103
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:35,190
not quite there, Wade.

1104
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,426
hey, Joey, how's that whole
warm-washcloth thing going?

1105
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:39,362
- man, come on.

1106
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:41,029
how's it going, asshole?

1107
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:44,767
hey, i'm here to save your ass,
Wade, all right?

1108
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:47,770
okay, guys...
there's a notebook
that we and a certain cougar

1109
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,538
are gonna have
to make disappear.

1110
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:52,908
God, man, you're still
into that stupid-ass idea?

1111
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,611
hey, it wasn't
my stupid idea to draw shit
flying out of people,

1112
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:57,346
or evil babes trying
to figure out 69,

1113
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,515
though that
was pretty cool.

1114
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,518
how long do you guys think
it'll be before Assumpta
sees your names in there?

1115
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:04,520
you guys
are gonna be expelled...

1116
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:08,357
just like we were.

1117
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:12,561
shit.

1118
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,100
all right, man,
we'll do it.

1119
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,668
all right.

1120
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:20,836
we're in.

1121
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:25,341
Francis, come on.

1122
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:27,676
you got what you wanted,
and now it's my turn.

1123
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:30,279
- i got what i wanted?
- yeah.

1124
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,880
i'm completely screwed.

1125
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,717
then we're both screwed.

1126
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:36,785
so we got to do something
about it, right?

1127
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,387
you and me.

1128
01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:41,724
i can't do this
without you.

1129
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:47,396
you with me, here,
altar boy?

1130
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:55,404
that's it.

1131
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,875
all right.
for the gods.

1132
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,413
no.

1133
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:05,881
for the gods.

1134
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:08,351
for the g--

1135
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:09,718
for God.

1136
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,322
for the gods.

1137
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,424
- what are you doing, man?

1138
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:21,330
hey, hey, hey, hey!
stop! we're wasting beer!

1139
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,731
you want some?
ooh, there you go!

1140
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,503
all right, everybody,
seriously...

1141
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,972
think like cougars.

1142
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,789
let's go.

1143
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:49,592
no, wait. guys? guys...
don't-- don't-- don't cougar's
mark their territory?

1144
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:52,227
no, no, no, no,
that's wolves.
come on. come on.

1145
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,268
whoo!

1146
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:03,506
all: whoo!

1147
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:18,120
flesh to bone
and bone to die.

1148
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:24,460
Time to finger
the culprit.

1149
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,028
Ay-yi-i-i!

1150
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:40,308
ah, ding-fucking-dong.

1151
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:43,646
the bitch is dead.

1152
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,493
come on.

1153
01:24:58,494 --> 01:25:00,896
stop.

1154
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,274
are we downwind?

1155
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,342
hopefully, not from him.

1156
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:17,780
all right,
i'm gonna go check it out.
you three go get the gate.

1157
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,829
come on, you guys.

1158
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:04,960
- hurry.
- all right, now, wait till
you get on the other side of me.

1159
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,695
all right, Joey,
get in the...

1160
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:22,745
- now, just pull it off.
- really? pull it off?

1161
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:37,660
can you open this?

1162
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,297
oh! what the hell is this?

1163
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:45,133
Sullivan's surefire
cougar tranquilizer.

1164
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:47,502
he cooked up a paste
of stolen pharmaceuticals

1165
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,237
and uncut Angel dust.

1166
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:51,674
-  Angel dust?
- where'd you get Angel dust?

1167
01:26:51,674 --> 01:26:53,408
- hey, Joey?
- what?

1168
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,710
shine your flashlight on him.

1169
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:00,448
wait. go back. go back.

1170
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:01,984
there. there.

1171
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:03,586
here, why don't you
give it a shot?

1172
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:04,887
- you sure?
- yeah.

1173
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:06,855
- thanks.
- just go.

1174
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:08,456
- sorry.
- maybe you're not
gonna make it anyway.

1175
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:10,893
- hurry up.
- push it in.

1176
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,795
- you missed it.
- shit!

1177
01:27:12,795 --> 01:27:15,363
- don't worry about it.
- no, wait. you flushed him.

1178
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:17,733
you know, that's what
i was trying to do.

1179
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,802
we got it.

1180
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:25,674
why don't you give it a shot?

1181
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:30,613
yeah, like he's gonna
do better.

1182
01:27:30,613 --> 01:27:32,915
he'll do it.

1183
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:39,655
- holy shit!

1184
01:27:39,655 --> 01:27:41,556
oh, my God, you got him!
good job, man.

1185
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:43,325
- oh, my--
- good job.

1186
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:45,560
all that kissing must've
strengthened your cheeks.

1187
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,329
i could've done that.

1188
01:27:47,329 --> 01:27:50,365
it's such a tiny dart, though.
you think it'll work?

1189
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,701
well, we'll see.

1190
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:57,105
he's going down.

1191
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,173
whoo.

1192
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:00,609
guys, quiet.

1193
01:28:06,915 --> 01:28:08,717
ye of little faith.

1194
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:11,219
Jesus, Sullivan,
i don't believe it.

1195
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,022
we just knocked out a cougar
with a kmart blowgun.

1196
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,924
- yes!
- you're a genius!

1197
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:17,492
that was great, man!

1198
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:20,228
- get him?
- let's go, man!

1199
01:28:21,697 --> 01:28:23,899
- hey, what are you doing?

1200
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:27,169
- we've unlocked the gate.
- risk leads to greatness.

1201
01:28:27,169 --> 01:28:30,072
yeah, but, Tim,
i thought we were all
gonna go in together.

1202
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,865
- wait.
- get in there.

1203
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:10,112
he's fine.
breathing fine.

1204
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:14,049
he's beautiful.

1205
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:18,086
so hot.

1206
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:20,655
- shit! Tim, look out!

1207
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:23,158

be okay, Timmy.
