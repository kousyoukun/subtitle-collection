1
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,732
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:32,379
You know,

3
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,691
I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now.

4
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,282
If I wanted to.

5
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,704
You know, kiddo.

6
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:52,114
I'd like to believe you're
aware enough, even now,

7
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:58,476
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

8
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,932
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

9
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:08,359
But not you.

10
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,934
No, kiddo.

11
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,820
At this moment...

12
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:23,528
This is me at my most masochistic.

13
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:25,118
Bill.

14
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,666

Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

56
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,138
What you gonna do now, huh?

57
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,589
What you got?

58
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,229
I got your ass. Remember that?

59
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,377
Remember?

60
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,992
Okay. Come on, bitch.

61
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,247
Come on. Bring it on.

62
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:52,857
mommy, I'm home.

63
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:54,275
Hey, baby.

64
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,286
How was school?

65
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,996
mommy, what happened to
you and the TV room?

66
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,150
Oh.

67
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,787
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

68
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,206
in the living room and
acted a damn fool.

69
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,958
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

70
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,336
Baby, now, you can't come in here.

71
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:17,395
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

72
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:26,641
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

73
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:28,684
Hi, honey.

74
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:32,368
I'm Beatrix. What's your name?

75
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,568
Her name is Nikki.

76
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:39,250
Nikki.

77
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,871
Such a pretty name for
such a pretty girl.

78
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,757
How old are you, Nikki?

79
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:50,414
Nikki,

80
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:52,343
Beatrix asked you a question.

81
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:55,503
I'm 4.

82
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:58,140
4 years old?

83
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:02,520
You know, I had a
little girl once.

84
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,648
She'd be about 4 now.

85
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:11,978
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend

86
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:14,522
got some grown-up
talk to talk about.

87
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,023
You go in your room.

88
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,110
I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

89
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,042
Okay?

90
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,906
Nikki.

91
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,247
In your room. Now.

92
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,549
You want some coffee?

93
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,890
Yeah. Sure.

94
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,894
This Pasadena homemaker's name

95
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,061
is Jeanne Bell.

96
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,272
Her husband is Dr Lawrence Bell.

97
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:59,358
But back when we were
acquainted, four years ago,

98
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,277
her name was Vernita Green.

99
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:04,363
Her code name was Copperhead.

100
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:06,198
Mine, Black Mamba.

101
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:07,880
Do you have a towel?

102
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:10,883
Yeah.

103
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:16,796
Thanks.

104
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:19,131
You still take cream
and sugar, right?

105
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,767
Yeah.

106
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,846
So I suppose it's a little
late for an apology?

107
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:28,224
You suppose correctly.

108
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:30,559
Look, bitch, I need to know

109
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,312
if you're gonna start any more
shit around my baby girl.

110
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:35,574
You can relax for now.

111
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:40,416
I'm not gonna murder you in
front of your child, okay?

112
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:43,030
That's being more rational

113
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,407
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

114
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:49,662
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

115
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,878
Not rationality.

116
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:57,962
Look.

117
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,755
I know I fucked you over.

118
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,590
I fucked you over bad.

119
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,102
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.

120
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,054
You have every right
to want to get even.

121
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,473
No, no, no, no, no.

122
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:10,891
No.

123
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:14,562
To get even, even Stephen,

124
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:20,442
I would have to kill you, go
up to Nikki's room, kill her,

125
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,737
then wait for your husband, the
good Dr Bell, to come home

126
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,865
and kill him.

127
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:28,377
That would be even, Vernita.

128
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,661
That'd be about square.

129
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:33,747
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

130
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,383
But I can't.

131
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,753
All I can tell you is that
I'm a different person now.

132
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:42,715
Oh, great.

133
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:43,815
I don't care.

134
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,467
Be that as it may,

135
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,596
I know I don't deserve your
mercy or your forgiveness.

136
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:53,058
However, I beseech you for
both on behalf of my daughter.

137
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:56,651
Bitch, you can stop right there.

138
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:59,815
Just because I have
no wish to murder you

139
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:01,567
before the eyes of your daughter

140
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,236
does not mean that parading
her in front of me

141
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:07,031
is gonna inspire sympathy.

142
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:10,117
You and I have
unfinished business.

143
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:12,411
And not a goddamn
thing you've done

144
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:13,996
in the subsequent four years,

145
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:18,306
including getting knocked
up, is gonna change that.

146
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,712
So when do we do this?

147
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:23,672
It all depends.

148
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:26,592
When do you want to die?

149
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:29,428
Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?

150
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:31,013
How about tonight, bitch?

151
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:33,307
Splendid. Where?

152
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,143
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach Little League

153
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,519
about a mile from here.

154
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,939
We meet there around
2.30 in the morning,

155
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,026
dressed all in black, your
hair in a black stocking.

156
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,612
And we have us a knife fight.

157
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,656
We won't be bothered.

158
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:53,876
Now, I have to fix Nikki's cereal.

159
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:04,880
Bill said you were one of
the best ladies he saw

160
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,298
with an edged weapon.

161
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:08,717
Fuck you, bitch.

162
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:11,095
I know he didn't
qualify that shit.

163
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:15,484
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

164
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:17,393
Black Mamba.

165
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,354
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

166
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:21,605
Weapon of choice?

167
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,447
If you want to stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

168
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:28,654
Very funny, bitch.

169
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,495
Very funny.

170
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:31,935
It was not my intention to
do this in front of you.

171
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,138
For that, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:39,071
But you can take my word for it.

173
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:44,531
Your mother had it coming.

174
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:06,349
When you grow up, if you
still feel raw about it...

175
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,595
I'll be waiting.

176
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,779
For those regarded as warriors...

177
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,079
when engaged in combat...

178
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:27,221
the vanquishing of thine enemy can
be the warriors only concern.

179
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:33,963
Suppress all human
emotions and compassion...

180
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:45,275
kill whoever stands in thy
way, even if that be Lord God,

181
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,205
or Buddha himself.

182
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:58,016
This truth lies at
the heart of combat.

183
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:23,996
You all, come on out
to Dallas, ya hear?

184
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:28,250
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

185
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,460
And next, we got some record.

186
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,678
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.

187

Well, give me the gory
details, Son Number One.

195
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:16,520
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

196
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:21,309
They wiped out the whole wedding
party, execution style.

197
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,224
Give me a figure.

198
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:27,100
Nine dead bodies.

199
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,728
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

200
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:32,648
Bride. Groom.

201
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:34,441
Reverend.

202
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,985
Reverend's wife.

203
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:38,793
Hell, they even shot that old

204
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:41,032
coloured fella that
plays the organ.

205
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:43,575
It would appear to me somebody
objected to this union

206
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:46,542
and wasn't able to
hold their peace.

207
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:54,680
Good gravy, Marie.

208
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,635
What'd I tell you, Pop?

209
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:04,888
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

210
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:07,766
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

211
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:11,109
- You're in a house of worship.
- Sorry, Pop.

212
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:15,691
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

213
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,785
I'd guesstimate Mexican
Mafia hit squad.

214
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:23,198
Four, maybe five strong.

215
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,325
How can you tell?

216
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:28,087
Well, a sure and
steady hand did this.

217
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:32,207
This ain't no squirrelly amateur.

218
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:35,419
This is the work of a salty dog.

219
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,380
You can tell by the
cleanliness of the carnage.

220
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,092
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

221
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:45,470
all the colours are
kept inside the lines.

222
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,064
If you was a moron, you
could almost admire it.

223
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,196
Who's the bride?

224
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:04,740
Don't know.

225
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,742
The name on the
marriage certificate

226
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:09,703
is Arlene Machiavelli.

227
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,079
That's a fake.

228
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:12,821
We've all just been calling her,

229
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,834
"The Bride" on account
of the dress.

230
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:17,919
You can tell she was pregnant.

231
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,713
Man would have to be a mad dog

232
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:23,522
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

233
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,484
Look at her.

234
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:31,767
Hay-coloured hair.

235
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,311
Big eyes.

236
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:37,153
She's a little
blood-spattered angel.

237
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,611
Son Number One?

238
00:19:42,711 --> 00:19:43,862
Yeah?

239
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:48,502
This tall drink of
cocksucker ain't dead.

240
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,825
I might never have liked you.

241
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:30,535
Point in fact, I despise you.

242
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:35,874
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

243
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:42,290
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

244
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,377
that our kind is rarely afforded.

245
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:48,811
My gift to you.

246
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,311
For fuck's sake.

247
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:02,240
Hello, Bill.

248
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:05,897
What's her condition?

249
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:08,159
Comatose.

250
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,443
Where is she?

251
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:13,780
I'm standing over her right now.

252
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,962
That's my girl.

253
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:21,288
Elle, you're going to
abort the mission.

254
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:22,581
What?

255
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,249
We owe her better than that.

256
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,084
Oh, you don't owe her shit.

257
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:27,794
Will you keep your voice down?

258
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:29,754
You don't owe her shit.

259
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,923
May I say one thing?

260
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:33,855
Speak.

261
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:36,928
You all beat the hell
out of that woman.

262
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:38,888
But you didn't kill her.

263
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:40,932
And I put a bullet in her head.

264
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:44,185
But her heart just
kept on beating.

265
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,854
Now, you saw that yourself

266
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:50,744
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

267
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:55,113
We've done a lot of
things to this lady.

268
00:23:55,213 --> 00:24:00,702
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

269
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:02,704
But one thing we won't do

270
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:07,167
is sneak into her room in
the night like a filthy rat

271
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:10,134
and kill her in her sleep.

272
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:13,882
And the reason we
won't do that thing

273
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:18,887
is because that thing
would lower us.

274
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:21,354
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

275
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:24,559
I guess.

276
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,151
Do you really have to guess?

277
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:29,314
No.

278
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:33,157
I don't really have
to guess. I know.

279
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,793
Come on home, honey.

280
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:40,163
Affirmative.

281
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:43,536
I love you very much.

282
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:45,673
I love you, too.

283
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:50,348
Bye-bye.

284
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,941
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

285
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:10,105
Word of advice, shit head.

286
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:13,243
Don't you ever wake up.

287
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:54,733
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

288
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,996
Bill, it's your baby.

289
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:03,641
Oh, my baby.

290
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:31,329
Four years.

291
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:33,011
Four years.

292
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:05,029
The price is $75 a
fuck, my friend.

293
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:07,031
You getting your freak on or what?

294
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:08,963
Oh, yeah, boy.

295
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:15,290
20, 40, 60, 75.

296
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,333
Yeah. Now here's the rules.

297
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,127
Rule number one.

298
00:28:19,227 --> 00:28:20,295
No punching her.

299
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:22,171
Nurse comes in and
she got a shiner

300
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:23,798
or less some teeth, jig's up.

301
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:26,259
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

302
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,344
And by the way, this
cunt's a spitter.

303
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:29,888
It's a motor-reflex thing.

304
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,806
But spit or no, no punching.

305
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:34,046
Now, are we absolutely,
positively clear on rule one?

306
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,094
Yeah.

307
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:38,203
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites. No Hickeys.

308
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:40,815
In fact, no leaving
no marks of no kind.

309
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:44,033
After that, it's all good, buddy.

310
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,195
Now, her plumbing down
there don't work no more.

311
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:47,864
So feel free to come
in her all you want.

312
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:49,824
Keep the noise down. Try
not to make a mess.

313
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,665
I'll be back in 20.

314
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,245
Yeah.

315
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:56,080
Oh, shit.

316
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,666
By the way, not all the
time, but sometimes

317
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,336
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

318
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:04,849
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

319
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:07,809
Bon appétit, good buddy.

320
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:19,902
Oh, yeah.

321
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:22,982
Oh, God damn.

322
00:29:23,082 --> 00:29:25,699
You are the best-looking
girl I've had today.

323
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,752
Oh.

324
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:17,120
Yo, stud. Time's up, buddy.

325
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,871
Coming in, ready or not.

326
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:21,633
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time, man?

327
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,254
Whoa.

328
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:55,793
Where's Bill?

329
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:58,507
Where's Bill?

330
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,955
Please stop hitting me.

331
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:02,216
Where's Bill?

332
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,334
I don't know who Bill is.

333
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:06,924
Bullshit.

334
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:18,389
Well, ain't you the slice of
cutie pie they said you was?

335
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,642
Jane Doe, huh? Oh, we don't
know shit about you, do we?

336
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,686
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

337
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:27,575
My name is Buck, and
I'm here to fuck.

338
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,654
Your name is Buck.

339
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:35,323
Right?

340
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,659
And you came here to fuck.

341
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,078
Right?

342
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,215
Wait a minute. Wait.

343
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:09,732
"Pussy Wagon."

344
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:11,698
You fucker.

345
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,853
Texas. Okay.

346
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,258
Wiggle your big toe.

347
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:37,595
Wiggle your big toe.

348
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:47,403
Wiggle your big toe.

349
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:54,987
Wiggle your big toe.

350
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:01,696
Wiggle your big toe.

351
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:03,990
As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,

352
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,784
trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...

353
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:08,536
Wiggle your big toe.

354
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:12,540
I could see the faces of the
cunts who did this to me.

355
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,507
And the dicks responsible.

356
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:21,977
Members all of the Deadly
Viper Assassination Squad.

357
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:26,053
When fortune smiles on something

358
00:35:26,153 --> 00:35:28,389
as violent and ugly as revenge,

359
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:32,601
it seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,

360
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:34,812
you're doing his will.

361
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:37,481
At a time when I knew the
least about my enemies,

362
00:35:37,581 --> 00:35:39,650
the first name on my death list,

363
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,487
O-Ren Ishii, was the
easiest to find.

364
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:46,157
But, of course, when one
manages the difficult task

365
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:48,701
of becoming queen of
the Tokyo underworld,

366
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:51,964
one doesn't keep it
a secret, does one?

367
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,096
O-Ren Ishii was born on
an American military base

368
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,265
in Tokyo, Japan.

369
00:36:11,365 --> 00:36:14,769
The half-Japanese, half-Chinese,
American army brat

370
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:18,189
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.

371
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,566
It was at that age she witnessed

372
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,526
the death of her
parents at the hands

373
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:28,292
of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.

374
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:54,446
Hyah.

375
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,093
Oh.

376
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:48,533
mommy.

377
00:40:57,614 --> 00:40:59,892
She swore revenge.

378
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:03,405
Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto

379
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:05,212
was a paedophile.

380
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:11,163
At 11, she got her revenge.

381
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,264
Look at me Matsumoto...

382
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,009
take a good look at my face.

383
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,316
Look at my eyes.

384
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,615
Look at my nose.

385
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,251
Look at my chin.

386
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,758
Look at my mouth.

387
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,157
Do I look familiar?

388
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:50,638
Do I look like someone
you murdered.

389
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:18,278
By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.

390
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,530
At 25, she did her
part in the killing

391
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:13,076
of nine innocent people,
including my unborn daughter,

392
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:18,039
in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso, Texas.

393
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:25,755
But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.

394
00:44:25,855 --> 00:44:28,472
She should have killed 10.

395
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:33,304
However, before
satisfaction would be mine,

396
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,598
first things first.

397
00:44:35,698 --> 00:44:38,690
Wiggle your big toe.

398
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:47,694
Hard part's over.

399
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:51,879
Now, let's get these
other piggies wiggling.

400
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:28,443
Welcome to Air O. May I help you?

401
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:30,830
Okinawa. One-way.

402
00:45:57,864 --> 00:45:58,973
Hi.

403
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,423
Welcome...

404
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,407
Welcome.

405
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,616
You English?

406
00:46:10,752 --> 00:46:13,071
Almost. American.

407
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:16,825
American. Welcome, American.

408
00:46:16,925 --> 00:46:18,284
Domo.

409
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:20,995
My English very good.

410
00:46:21,095 --> 00:46:22,580
You said "domo."

411
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,332
Can you speak Japanese?

412
00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:25,500
No, no.

413
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,467
Just a few words I
learned since yesterday.

414
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:31,131
May I sit at the bar?

415
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:33,643
Oh, sure, sure, sure. Please sit.

416
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:35,738
Oh.

417
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,390
What other words did you learn?

418
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,433
Oh, just a minute.

419
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,866
We have a customer. Bring
out some tea, quickly.

420
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,831
I'm watching my soap operas.

421
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,977
Lazy bastard...

422
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,169
Screw your soap opera...

423
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,844
The tea's hot. Why don't you
serve it yourself for once?

424
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:01,014
Shut up.

425
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:03,830
Get your ass out here.

426
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,171
Excuse me.

427
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,337
What other Japanese do you know?

428
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:12,630
Oh, let's see.

429
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,591
"Arigato."

430
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:17,149
"Arigato." Good.

431
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:21,139
I already said "domo", right?

432
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,766
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:24,981
"Konn-itch-iwa."

434
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:28,605
"Kohn-nee-Chee-wah."

435
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:30,106
Konnichi wa. Please repeat.

436
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:31,608
Konnichi wa.

437
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,569
Perfect. Good, good, good.

438
00:47:34,669 --> 00:47:37,488
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

439
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,115
Now you're making fun of me.

440
00:47:39,215 --> 00:47:41,784
No, no, no, no. Serious business.

441
00:47:41,884 --> 00:47:44,996
Pronunciation very good.

442
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:49,681
You say arigato like
we say arigato.

443
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:55,975
Well, thank you. I mean, arigato.

444
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,011
You should learn Japanese.

445
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:02,096
Very easy.

446
00:48:02,196 --> 00:48:04,224
No kidding. I heard
it was kind of hard.

447
00:48:04,324 --> 00:48:06,309
Most difficult.

448
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:09,367
But you have Japanese tongue.

449
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:13,413
Okay, okay.

450
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:18,589
Oh, my God.

451
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:26,728
Hey, what the hell happened to
the tea. Hurry up... goddammit.

452
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,208
Lazy oaf...

453
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,308
What'd ya want?

454
00:48:41,277 --> 00:48:42,720
I beg your pardon?

455
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,015
Drink.

456
00:48:46,115 --> 00:48:49,894
Oh, yes. A bottle of
warm sake, please.

457
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:51,771
Warm sake?

458
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:53,690
Very good.

459
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,223
One warm sake.

460
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,824
Sake? In the middle of the day?

461
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:03,634
Day, night, afternoon, Who
gives a damn? Get the sake.

462
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,705
How come I always
have to get the sake?

463
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:07,868
You listen well...

464
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,877
For thirty years you make
the fish. I get the sake.

465
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:17,410
If this were the military,
I'd be a General by now.

466
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,923
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

467
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,648
If you were General,
I'd be Emperor,

468
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:29,121
and you'd still get the sake.
So shut up and get the sake.

469
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,198
I'm not bald, okay?
I shave my head.

470
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:34,077
Do you understand me?

471
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:38,706
Sorry.

472
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:44,004
Oh. Oh, oh. First time in Japan?

473
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,059
Huh.

474
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,060
Oh.

475
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:48,835
What brings you to Okinawa?

476
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:50,580
I came to see a man.

477
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,249
Oh, yeah.

478
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:56,252
You have a friend live in Okinawa?

479
00:49:56,352 --> 00:49:57,920
Not quite.

480
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,714
Not friend?

481
00:49:59,814 --> 00:50:01,132
I never met him.

482
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:03,009
Never?

483
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:05,261
Who is he?

484
00:50:05,361 --> 00:50:06,692
May I ask?

485
00:50:07,697 --> 00:50:10,314
Hattori Hanzo.

486
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,888
What do you want
with Hattori Hanzo?

487
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,053
I need Japanese steel.

488
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,129
Why do you need Japanese steel?

489
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,765
I have vermin to kill.

490
00:50:42,565 --> 00:50:48,402
You must have big rats, you
need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

491
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,647
Huge.

492
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:22,565
May I?

493
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:24,406
You may.

494
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:28,779
Wait.

495
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,416
Try the second one down.

496
00:53:24,352 --> 00:53:26,295
Funny.

497
00:53:26,395 --> 00:53:28,853
You like samurai swords.

498
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:34,317
I like baseball.

499
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,077
I wanted to show you these.

500
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:50,982
However, someone as you, who knows
so much, must surely know...

501
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:57,523
I no longer make
instruments of death.

502
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,968
What I have here,

503
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:07,569
I keep for their aesthetic
and sentimental value.

504
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:12,578
Yet proud as I am of
my life's work...

505
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:20,579
I have retired.

506
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:29,984
Then give me one of these.

507
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:32,416
These are not for sale.

508
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:35,990
I didn't say "sell me."

509
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,001
I said "give me."

510
00:54:40,094 --> 00:54:43,337
Why should I help you?

511
00:54:43,472 --> 00:54:48,308
Because my vermin is a
former student of yours.

512
00:54:50,938 --> 00:54:54,300
And considering the student,

513
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,520
I'd say you have a
rather large obligation.

514
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,546
You can sleep here.

515
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,756
It will take me a month
to make the sword.

516
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,895
I suggest you spend it practising.

517
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,582
I've completed doing...

518
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:46,219
what I swore an oath
to God, 28 years ago,

519
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:51,094
to never do again.

520
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:57,002
I have created, "something
that kills people."

521
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,508
And in that respect,
It is a success.

522
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:16,451
I've done this because I am
sympathetic to your aim.

523
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,934
I can tell you with no ego,
this is my finest sword.

524
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,371
If on your journey, you
should encounter God...

525
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,632
God will be slashed.

526
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,821
Yellow-haired warrior. Go.

527
00:58:51,303 --> 00:58:53,169
Domo.

528
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:17,771
It was one year after the
massacre in El Paso, Texas,

529
00:59:17,871 --> 00:59:19,857
that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny

530
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,192
financially and
philosophically in her

531
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,653
Shakespearian-in-magnitude
power struggle

532
00:59:24,753 --> 00:59:26,196
with the other yakuza clans

533
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:30,326
over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.

534
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:32,703
When the final sword was sheathed,

535
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:35,886
it was O-Ren Ishii and
her powerful posse...

536
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:40,429
the Crazy 88, that
proved the victor.

537
00:59:42,896 --> 00:59:44,798
The pretty lady to O-Ren's right,

538
00:59:44,898 --> 00:59:47,426
who's dressed like she's a
villain on "Star Trek,"

539
00:59:47,526 --> 00:59:50,971
is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.

540
00:59:51,071 --> 00:59:55,726
The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale,

541
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:59,160
another former protégée of Bill's.

542
01:00:01,623 --> 01:00:03,817
The young girl in the
school-girl uniform

543
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:09,198
is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.

544
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:12,743
Gogo may be young, but
what she lacks in age,

545
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:15,287
she makes up for in madness.

546
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,303
Do you like Ferraris?

547
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,649
Ferrari... Italian trash.

548
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,988
Do you want to fuck me?

549
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:39,564
Don't laugh. Do you want
to fuck me, yes or no?

550
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:41,903
Yes.

551
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,665
How about now, big boy?

552
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,473
Do you still wish
to penetrate me...

553
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,217
or is it I... who
has penetrated you?

554
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,262
See what I mean?

555
01:01:01,683 --> 01:01:06,255
The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,

556
01:01:06,355 --> 01:01:10,770
the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.

557
01:01:12,528 --> 01:01:14,805
And just in case
you were wondering

558
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:19,143
how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American

559
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:25,232
become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan, I'll tell you.

560
01:01:25,332 --> 01:01:28,193
The subject of O-Ren's
blood and nationality

561
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:30,946
came up before the
council only once.

562
01:01:31,046 --> 01:01:35,951
The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.

563
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:38,412
The man who seems
bound and determined

564
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:40,956
to break the mood is Boss Tanaka.

565
01:01:41,056 --> 01:01:43,889
And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...

566
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,133
Boss Tanaka. What's the
meaning of this outburst?

567
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,973
This is a time for celebration.

568
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:58,172
And what exactly are
we celebrating?

569
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,679
The perversion of our
illustrious council?

570
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,753
Tanaka, have you gone mad?
I will not tolerate this.

571
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,019
You're disrespecting
our sister. Apologise.

572
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,588
Tanaka-San, of what
perversion do you speak?

573
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:25,008
My father along with
yours, and along

574
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:27,307
with yours, started this council.

575
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,608
And while...

576
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,145
You laugh like stupid donkeys
they weep in the afterlife...

577
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,750
Shut up.

578
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,216
Over the perversion
committed today.

579
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:43,625
Outrageous. Tanaka, it is you
who insults this council.

580
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,693
Bastard.

581
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,022
Fuck face.

582
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,163
Gentlemen.

583
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:56,872
Tanaka obviously has
something on his mind.

584
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:02,166
By all means, allow
him to express it.

585
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:07,908
I speak of the perversion
done to this council,

586
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,611
which I love...

587
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,016
more than my own children,

588
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,318
by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader.

589
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:44,681
So that you understand
how serious I am...

590
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,689
I'm going to say this in English.

591
01:03:48,769 --> 01:03:49,801
Huh.

592
01:04:01,196 --> 01:04:03,599
As your leader...

593
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:05,601
I encourage you from time to time,

594
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:09,688
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

595
01:04:09,788 --> 01:04:11,023
If you're unconvinced

596
01:04:11,123 --> 01:04:13,567
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

597
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:14,860
tell me so.

598
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,570
But allow me to convince you.

599
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,697
And I promise you,
right here and now,

600
01:04:18,797 --> 01:04:22,326
no subject will ever be taboo.

601
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:25,714
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

602
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,583
The price you pay

603
01:04:29,683 --> 01:04:32,961
for bringing up either my
Chinese or American heritage

604
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:37,282
as a negative is, I collect
your fucking head.

605
01:04:37,782 --> 01:04:40,149
Just like this fucker here.

606
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:42,167
Just like this fucker here.

607
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:45,223
Now, if any of you sons of bitches

608
01:04:45,323 --> 01:04:50,159
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time.

609
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:53,828
I didn't think so.

610
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:59,021
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

611
01:05:00,087 --> 01:05:02,545
One ticket to Tokyo, please.

612
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,526
Moshi moshi.

613
01:09:14,425 --> 01:09:15,756
Hey.

614
01:09:17,928 --> 01:09:19,544
- Hey, yeah.

615
01:09:58,552 --> 01:10:00,589

They demand ridiculous things.

Shut up... Do you know what
would happen if they heard you?

633

we will get back to you.

Hey. You.

654
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,916
Who do you remind me of?

655
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,309
Charlie Brown.

656
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,956
You're right, he does
look like Charlie Brown.

657
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,385
Charlie Brown, Four
pepperoni pizzas.

658
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,842
That's not on our menu...

659
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:56,729
I don't care, bring
them, goddammit.

660
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,433
Hey... hey... Charlie,
give me a kiss.

661
01:13:59,919 --> 01:14:02,081
O-Ren Ishii.

662
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,870
You and I have
unfinished business.

663
01:14:36,749 --> 01:14:37,958
Beatrix

664
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,961
Charlie Brown, beat it.

665
01:15:47,235 --> 01:15:48,817
Miki.

666
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,457
Tear the bitch apart.

667
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:46,916
So, O-Ren, any more
subordinates for me to kill?

668
01:17:48,427 --> 01:17:50,293
Hi.

669
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,600
Gogo, right?

670
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:55,793
Bingo.

671
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,103
And you're Black Mamba.

672
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,968
Our reputations precede us.

673
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:05,503
Don't they?

674
01:18:07,446 --> 01:18:12,737
Gogo, I know you feel you
must protect your mistress.

675
01:18:13,744 --> 01:18:16,313
But I beg you.

676
01:18:16,413 --> 01:18:18,450
Walk away.

677
01:18:24,797 --> 01:18:26,788
You call that begging?

678
01:18:32,429 --> 01:18:35,763
You can beg better than that.

679
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,403
Is that what I think it is?

680
01:21:51,503 --> 01:21:54,198
You didn't think it was gonna
be that easy, did you?

681
01:21:54,298 --> 01:21:57,806
You know, for a second there,

682
01:21:58,407 --> 01:22:01,492
yeah, I kind of did.

683
01:22:02,473 --> 01:22:04,339

01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:05,834

725
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,290
Those of you lucky enough to still

726
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,300
have your lives, take them with you.

727
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,132
However...

728
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:19,509
leave the limbs you've lost.

729
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:24,284
They belong to me now.

730
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:32,000
Except you, Sofie.

731
01:30:32,645 --> 01:30:35,808
You stay right where you are.

732
01:31:29,285 --> 01:31:31,377
Your instrument is
quite impressive.

733
01:31:36,528 --> 01:31:38,052
Where was it made?

734
01:31:39,879 --> 01:31:41,540
Okinawa.

735
01:31:43,601 --> 01:31:46,263
Whom in Okinawa made
you this steel?

736
01:31:47,344 --> 01:31:49,497
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

737
01:31:49,641 --> 01:31:50,869
You lie.

738
01:32:04,022 --> 01:32:05,990
Swords however, never get tired.

739
01:32:07,525 --> 01:32:11,154
I hope you've saved your energy.

740
01:32:14,632 --> 01:32:15,997
If you haven't...

741
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:20,128
you might not last five minutes.

742
01:32:22,073 --> 01:32:24,166
But as last looks go,

743
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:26,868
you could do worse.

744
01:35:05,793 --> 01:35:10,458
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

745
01:35:12,716 --> 01:35:15,583
You may not be able to
fight like a samurai.

746
01:35:18,722 --> 01:35:21,931
But you can at least
die like a samurai.

747
01:35:52,216 --> 01:35:53,843
Attack me...

748
01:35:55,086 --> 01:35:56,678
with everything you have.

749
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:55,002
For ridiculing you earlier...

750
01:36:57,115 --> 01:36:59,015
I apologise.

751
01:37:07,725 --> 01:37:08,885
Accepted.

752
01:37:25,543 --> 01:37:26,543
Ready?

753
01:37:31,582 --> 01:37:32,582
Come on.

754
01:37:46,147 --> 01:37:47,313
Hyah.

755
01:38:05,917 --> 01:38:13,917
That really was a
Hattori Hanzo sword.

756
01:40:20,635 --> 01:40:23,102
Sofie...

757
01:40:23,104 --> 01:40:24,670
Sofie...

758
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:26,763
My Sofie.

759
01:40:26,863 --> 01:40:29,195
I'm so sorry.

760
01:40:32,327 --> 01:40:35,689
Please. Please
forgive my betrayal.

761
01:40:35,789 --> 01:40:37,530
No more of that.

762
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,776
But still...

763
01:40:39,876 --> 01:40:41,992
But still... nothing.

764
01:40:44,006 --> 01:40:47,367
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

765
01:40:47,467 --> 01:40:50,380
to my beautiful and
brilliant Sofie.

766
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:54,416
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

767
01:40:54,516 --> 01:40:56,627
The first reason is information.

768
01:40:57,088 --> 01:41:02,082
Burn in Hell you stupid, stupid
blonde. I'll tell you nothing.

769
01:41:03,567 --> 01:41:07,679
But I am gonna ask you questions.

770
01:41:07,779 --> 01:41:11,808
And every time you
don't give me answers,

771
01:41:11,908 --> 01:41:14,400
I'm gonna cut something off.

772
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:21,207
And I promise you, they will
be things you will miss.

773
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,976
Give me your other arm.

774
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:40,252
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

775
01:41:40,352 --> 01:41:41,354
If you had to guess...

776
01:41:41,454 --> 01:41:42,897
What they've been doing.

777
01:41:42,997 --> 01:41:44,315
Why she left you alive...

778
01:41:44,415 --> 01:41:46,109
And where I can find them.

779
01:41:46,209 --> 01:41:48,997
What would be your guess?

780
01:41:50,004 --> 01:41:52,615
Guessing won't be necessary.

781
01:41:52,715 --> 01:41:54,797
She informed me.

782
01:41:57,136 --> 01:42:00,754
She said I could keep my
wicked life for two reasons.

783
01:42:01,891 --> 01:42:03,376
As I said before,

784
01:42:03,476 --> 01:42:07,014
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

785
01:42:08,147 --> 01:42:13,427
And the second reason is so
you can tell him, in person,

786
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:17,306
everything that
happened here tonight.

787
01:42:17,406 --> 01:42:20,726
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

788
01:42:20,826 --> 01:42:24,397
by witnessing your deformed body.

789
01:42:24,497 --> 01:42:28,651
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

790
01:42:28,751 --> 01:42:31,779
I want him to know what I know.

791
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:36,075
I want him to know.
I want him to know.

792
01:42:36,175 --> 01:42:38,578
And I want them all to know

793
01:42:38,678 --> 01:42:45,345
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

794
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:02,200
Now, the incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

795
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,400
that put this whole
gory story into motion

796
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,100
has since become legend.

797
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,200
"Massacre at Two Pines."

798
01:43:10,275 --> 01:43:12,075
That's what the newspapers called it.

799
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:18,376
Local TV news called it the El Paso
Texas wedding chapel massacre.

800
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,400
How it happened, who was there,

801
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
how many got killed
and who killed them,

802
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,500
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

803
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,000
In actual fact, the
massacre didn't

804
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,099
happen during a wedding at all.

805
01:43:33,163 --> 01:43:35,482
It was a wedding rehearsal.

806
01:43:35,582 --> 01:43:38,360
Now, when we come to
the part where I say,

807
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:41,989
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

808
01:43:42,089 --> 01:43:45,050
But don't stick your
tongue in her mouth.

809
01:43:47,052 --> 01:43:49,246
This might be funny
to your friends,

810
01:43:49,346 --> 01:43:52,641
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

811
01:43:54,184 --> 01:43:56,754
We'll try to restrain
ourselves, Reverend.

812
01:43:58,522 --> 01:44:00,524
You all got a song?

813
01:44:03,944 --> 01:44:07,181
How about "Love Me
Tender?" I can play that.

814
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:09,308
- Sure.
- Yeah.

815
01:44:09,408 --> 01:44:11,727
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

816
01:44:11,827 --> 01:44:13,954
Rufus, he's the man.

817
01:44:14,955 --> 01:44:18,067
Rufus, who was that that
you used to play for?

818
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:19,985
Rufus Thomas.

819
01:44:20,085 --> 01:44:22,988
Rufus Thomas. Rufus Thomas.

820
01:44:23,088 --> 01:44:27,493
I was a Drell. I was a
Drifter. I was a Coaster.

821
01:44:27,593 --> 01:44:31,121
I was part of the
Gang. I was a Barkay.

822
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:34,558
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

823
01:44:35,601 --> 01:44:39,396
Rufus, he's the man.

824
01:44:41,982 --> 01:44:44,134
Have I forgotten anything?

825
01:44:44,234 --> 01:44:47,805
Oh yes, you forgot, the
seating arrangements.

826
01:44:47,905 --> 01:44:49,573
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

827
01:44:50,657 --> 01:44:52,810
Now, the way we normally do this,

828
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:56,980
we have the bride's side, and
then we have the groom's side.

829
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,275
But since the bride ain't
got nobody coming,

830
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:04,405
and the groom's got far
too many people coming...

831
01:45:04,505 --> 01:45:06,882
Well, yeah, they're coming
all the way from Oklahoma.

832
01:45:09,092 --> 01:45:10,577
Right...

833
01:45:10,677 --> 01:45:13,706
Well, I don't see
no problem with...

834
01:45:13,806 --> 01:45:17,084
the groom's side sharing
the bride's side.

835
01:45:17,184 --> 01:45:18,222
Do you, Mother?

836
01:45:18,223 --> 01:45:20,003
I don't have a problem with that.

837
01:45:20,103 --> 01:45:21,103
But...

838
01:45:21,188 --> 01:45:25,526
Honey, you know, it would be
good if you had somebody come.

839
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,695
You know, as a sign of good faith?

840
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,391
Well, I don't have anybody...

841
01:45:32,491 --> 01:45:36,562
except for Tommy and my friends.

842
01:45:36,662 --> 01:45:38,131
You have no family?

843
01:45:38,132 --> 01:45:40,858
Well, I'm working
on changing that.

844
01:45:40,958 --> 01:45:42,987
Mrs Harmony, we're all the family

845
01:45:42,988 --> 01:45:45,254
this little angel's
ever gonna need.

846
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,016
I'm not feeling
very well, and this

847
01:45:49,017 --> 01:45:51,034
bitch is starting to piss me off.

848
01:45:51,134 --> 01:45:54,721
So while you all blather on, I'm
gonna go outside and get some air.

849
01:45:55,722 --> 01:45:57,875
Ok. Reverend, sorry...

850
01:45:57,975 --> 01:45:59,655
She's gonna go out
and get some air.

851
01:45:59,656 --> 01:46:01,378
Yeah. Given her
delicate condition...

852
01:46:01,478 --> 01:46:04,298
She just needs a few minutes to
get it together. She'll be ok.

853
01:46:04,398 --> 01:46:05,774
Right...

854
01:47:23,852 --> 01:47:25,312
Hello, Kiddo.

855
01:47:30,567 --> 01:47:35,155
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

856
01:47:38,825 --> 01:47:41,036
What are you doing here?

857
01:47:42,037 --> 01:47:44,247
What am I doing?

858
01:47:45,749 --> 01:47:47,860
Well...

859
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,421
moment ago I was playing my flute.

860
01:47:57,177 --> 01:47:59,429
At this moment...

861
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:02,562
I'm looking at the most beautiful

862
01:48:02,563 --> 01:48:05,018
bride these old eyes
have ever seen.

863
01:48:06,603 --> 01:48:10,440
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

864
01:48:12,776 --> 01:48:14,353
Are you gonna be nice?

865
01:48:14,354 --> 01:48:17,114
I've never been nice
in my whole life.

866
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:22,119
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

867
01:48:24,371 --> 01:48:26,690
I always told you...

868
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:30,152
your sweet side is you best side.

869
01:48:30,252 --> 01:48:35,132
I guess that's why you're the
only one who's ever seen it.

870
01:48:37,217 --> 01:48:41,430
So you got a bun in the oven.

871
01:48:42,806 --> 01:48:46,184
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

872
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:50,192
That young man of
yours sure doesn't

873
01:48:50,193 --> 01:48:52,841
believe in wasting time, does he?

874
01:48:52,941 --> 01:48:55,485
Have you seen Tommy?

875
01:48:57,571 --> 01:49:00,807
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

876
01:49:00,907 --> 01:49:02,951
Then I saw him.

877
01:49:04,119 --> 01:49:06,371
I like his hair.

878
01:49:07,372 --> 01:49:09,916
You promised you'd be nice.

879
01:49:11,835 --> 01:49:16,531
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

880
01:49:16,631 --> 01:49:18,867
But you're right.

881
01:49:18,967 --> 01:49:22,429
What does your young
man do for a living?

882
01:49:23,847 --> 01:49:26,750
He owns a used record
store here in El Paso.

883
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:31,396
- Ah. Music lover?
- He's fond of music.

884
01:49:32,689 --> 01:49:34,733
Aren't we all?

885
01:49:38,528 --> 01:49:42,532
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

886
01:49:44,034 --> 01:49:46,937
I work in the record store.

887
01:49:47,037 --> 01:49:49,498
Ah, so.

888
01:49:50,624 --> 01:49:53,627
It all suddenly seems so clear.

889
01:49:56,088 --> 01:50:00,717
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

890
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,287
I get to listen to
music all day...

891
01:50:04,387 --> 01:50:08,016
talk about music all
day. It's really cool.

892
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:12,896
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

893
01:50:15,732 --> 01:50:20,303
As opposed to jetting around the
world, killing human beings,

894
01:50:20,403 --> 01:50:23,115
and being paid vast sums of money?

895
01:50:25,242 --> 01:50:26,768
Precisely.

896
01:50:26,868 --> 01:50:29,688
Well, my old friend...

897
01:50:29,788 --> 01:50:32,149
to each his own.

898
01:50:32,249 --> 01:50:36,778
However, all cockblockery aside...

899
01:50:36,878 --> 01:50:40,323
I am looking forward to
meeting your young man.

900
01:50:40,423 --> 01:50:45,804
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

901
01:50:48,098 --> 01:50:49,870
You want to come to the wedding?

902
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:52,060
Only if I can sit on
the bride's side.

903
01:50:53,687 --> 01:50:56,256
You'll find it a bit
lonely on my side.

904
01:50:56,356 --> 01:50:59,760
Your side always was a bit lonely.

905
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:02,696
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

906
01:51:05,157 --> 01:51:07,309
You know...

907
01:51:07,409 --> 01:51:09,853
I had the loveliest
dream about you...

908
01:51:09,953 --> 01:51:12,330
Oh, here's Tommy. Call me Arlene.

909
01:51:13,081 --> 01:51:14,366
You must be Tommy.

910
01:51:14,666 --> 01:51:16,860
Arlene's told me
so much about you.

911
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,988
- Honey, you ok?
- Oh, I'm fine.

912
01:51:20,088 --> 01:51:22,632
Tommy, I'd like you
to meet my father.

913
01:51:24,092 --> 01:51:25,869
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, my God.

914
01:51:25,969 --> 01:51:28,080
Oh, my God, this is great.

915
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,749
I'm so glad to meet
you, sir... oh, Dad.

916
01:51:30,849 --> 01:51:33,101
The name's Bill.

917
01:51:33,226 --> 01:51:35,003
Well, it's great to
meet you... Bill.

918
01:51:35,103 --> 01:51:37,812
Arlene told me you
couldn't make it.

919
01:51:37,813 --> 01:51:38,813
Surprise.

920
01:51:38,815 --> 01:51:42,010
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

921
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:45,514
Well, in the surprise
department...

922
01:51:45,614 --> 01:51:48,975
the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

923
01:51:49,075 --> 01:51:51,311
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

924
01:51:51,411 --> 01:51:53,451
Did you come straight
from Australia?

925
01:51:53,452 --> 01:51:54,496
Of course.

926
01:51:54,497 --> 01:51:56,603
Daddy, I told Tommy
that you were in Perth

927
01:51:56,704 --> 01:51:57,943
mining for silver, and...

928
01:51:58,043 --> 01:52:00,103
no one could reach you.

929
01:52:00,503 --> 01:52:03,907
Lucky for us all,
that's not the case.

930
01:52:04,107 --> 01:52:05,351
So...

931
01:52:06,051 --> 01:52:09,746
What's this all about? I've
heard of wedding rehearsals,

932
01:52:09,846 --> 01:52:11,998
but I don't believe
I've ever heard

933
01:52:11,999 --> 01:52:14,209
of a wedding dress
rehearsal before.

934
01:52:14,309 --> 01:52:15,544
We thought,

935
01:52:15,644 --> 01:52:18,880
"Why pay so much money for a dress
she only going to wear once?"

936
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:21,883
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

937
01:52:21,983 --> 01:52:23,854
So, I think we're
going to try to get

938
01:52:23,855 --> 01:52:25,528
all the mileage we can out of it.

939
01:52:27,113 --> 01:52:30,308
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

940
01:52:30,408 --> 01:52:33,536
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

941
01:52:34,162 --> 01:52:37,958
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

942
01:52:39,709 --> 01:52:41,903
I know just what you mean.

943
01:52:42,003 --> 01:52:43,012
Son?

944
01:52:43,213 --> 01:52:45,240
Some of us have places to be.

945
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:46,825
Sure do.

946
01:52:46,925 --> 01:52:49,428
Look, we got to go through
this one more time.

947
01:52:49,529 --> 01:52:51,229
So, why don't you have a s...

948
01:52:51,388 --> 01:52:55,292
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away.

949
01:52:55,392 --> 01:52:58,371
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

950
01:52:59,271 --> 01:53:01,673
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

951
01:53:01,773 --> 01:53:03,982
sitting with the
rest of the guests.

952
01:53:03,983 --> 01:53:05,018
Really?

953
01:53:05,019 --> 01:53:06,945
That's asking a lot.

954
01:53:08,196 --> 01:53:11,266
Oh. Ok. Well, forget it.

955
01:53:11,366 --> 01:53:14,311
But how about we go out to
dinner tonight to celebrate?

956
01:53:14,411 --> 01:53:16,980
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

957
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,399
Deal. We got to do this now.

958
01:53:19,499 --> 01:53:23,528
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

959
01:53:23,628 --> 01:53:26,923
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

960
01:53:30,302 --> 01:53:32,429
Mother, here we go.

961
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:37,225
Now son, about them vows...

962
01:53:43,315 --> 01:53:44,649
Bill...

963
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:50,347
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

964
01:53:50,447 --> 01:53:53,016
If he's the man you want...

965
01:53:53,116 --> 01:53:55,952
then go stand by him.

966
01:54:19,559 --> 01:54:23,688
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

967
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:36,284
Thank you.

968
01:54:41,734 --> 01:54:43,501
Oh, good.

969
01:55:11,152 --> 01:55:12,779
What the hell?

970
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:16,199
No. Bill.

971
01:55:55,388 --> 01:55:59,551
You telling me she cut her
way through 88 bodyguards

972
01:55:59,652 --> 01:56:01,461
before she got to O-Ren?

973
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:03,588
Nah, there wasn't
really 88 of 'em.

974
01:56:03,688 --> 01:56:06,424
They just call themselves
so "The Crazy 88"

975
01:56:06,524 --> 01:56:08,551
- How come?
- I don't know.

976
01:56:08,651 --> 01:56:11,680
I guess they thought
it sounded cool.

977
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:15,600
Any how, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

978
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:19,688
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

979
01:56:19,788 --> 01:56:23,191
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

980
01:56:23,291 --> 01:56:26,878
It would appear he has broken it.

981
01:56:29,089 --> 01:56:32,842
Them Japs sure know how to
hold a grudge, don't they?

982
01:56:35,178 --> 01:56:36,913
Or maybe...

983
01:56:37,013 --> 01:56:40,834
you just tend to bring
that out in people.

984
01:56:40,934 --> 01:56:45,088
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask it,

985
01:56:45,188 --> 01:56:49,651
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

986
01:56:52,237 --> 01:56:53,571
I...

987
01:56:54,572 --> 01:56:58,018
I pawned that years ago.

988
01:56:58,118 --> 01:57:01,454
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

989
01:57:02,122 --> 01:57:03,565
Yep.

990
01:57:03,665 --> 01:57:05,667
It was priceless.

991
01:57:10,088 --> 01:57:13,591
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

992
01:57:14,592 --> 01:57:17,720
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

993
01:57:19,347 --> 01:57:21,867
I'm a bouncer in a
titty bar, Bill.

994
01:57:25,278 --> 01:57:26,793
If she wants to fight with me, all

995
01:57:26,794 --> 01:57:28,486
she's got to do is
come to the club,

996
01:57:28,586 --> 01:57:31,192
and start some shit, and
we'll be in a fight.

997
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:36,914
I know we haven't
spoken in some time,

998
01:57:37,699 --> 01:57:41,278
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

999
01:57:41,578 --> 01:57:45,582
but you've got to get
over being mad at me,

1000
01:57:46,082 --> 01:57:48,234
and start becoming
afraid of Beatrix,

1001
01:57:48,334 --> 01:57:51,921
because she is coming, and
she's coming to kill you.

1002
01:57:53,256 --> 01:57:55,495
And unless you accept
my assistance,

1003
01:57:55,496 --> 01:57:57,552
I have no doubt she will succeed.

1004
01:58:06,478 --> 01:58:11,399
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't
Jew out of paying my comeuppance.

1005
01:58:13,526 --> 01:58:17,071
Can't we just... forget the past?

1006
01:58:19,866 --> 01:58:21,810
That woman...

1007
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:24,120
deserves her revenge.

1008
01:58:29,125 --> 01:58:30,543
And...

1009
01:58:31,419 --> 01:58:33,213
we deserve to die.

1010
01:58:38,218 --> 01:58:40,912
But then again...

1011
01:58:41,012 --> 01:58:43,014
so does she.

1012
01:58:46,434 --> 01:58:48,144
So I guess...

1013
01:58:49,145 --> 01:58:51,231
we'll just see.

1014
01:58:52,649 --> 01:58:54,651
Won't we?

1015
01:59:31,062 --> 01:59:32,922
Late again.

1016
01:59:33,022 --> 01:59:35,191
Budd, can't you tell time?

1017
01:59:36,234 --> 01:59:38,178
There ain't nobody in here, man.

1018
01:59:38,278 --> 01:59:40,472
- Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

1019
01:59:40,572 --> 01:59:43,475
Tell him to get his
fucking ass back here.

1020
01:59:43,575 --> 01:59:45,351
Ok.

1021
01:59:45,451 --> 01:59:49,038
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

1022
01:59:53,751 --> 01:59:56,796
Take a hit. Be somebody, baby.

1023
02:00:06,055 --> 02:00:07,690
You looking for me?

1024
02:00:13,896 --> 02:00:17,792
I don't know what car wash you
worked before you came here

1025
02:00:17,892 --> 02:00:21,095
that let you stroll in 20 minutes
late, but it wasn't owned by me

1026
02:00:21,195 --> 02:00:23,906
- and I own a fucking car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

1027
02:00:24,006 --> 02:00:26,226
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

1028
02:00:27,126 --> 02:00:28,244
Larry...

1029
02:00:29,203 --> 02:00:32,315
there ain't nobody
out there, so...

1030
02:00:32,415 --> 02:00:36,419
"There's nobody out there, Larry."

1031
02:00:37,879 --> 02:00:39,486
What's your point?

1032
02:00:40,006 --> 02:00:44,102
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

1033
02:00:44,802 --> 02:00:49,732
I'm the bouncer, and there ain't
nobody out there to bounce.

1034
02:00:49,832 --> 02:00:51,910
You're saying that the reason...

1035
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:56,798
that you're not doing
the job that I'm...

1036
02:00:56,898 --> 02:01:01,461
paying you to do is that you
don't have a job to do?

1037
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:05,723
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

1038
02:01:05,823 --> 02:01:08,250
What are you trying to
convince me of, exactly?

1039
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:10,912
That you're as useless as
an asshole right here?

1040
02:01:11,954 --> 02:01:14,174
Well, guess what, buddy.

1041
02:01:14,374 --> 02:01:15,806
I think...

1042
02:01:15,907 --> 02:01:19,002
you just fucking convinced me.

1043
02:01:20,154 --> 02:01:21,823
Let's go to the calendar.

1044
02:01:21,923 --> 02:01:23,975
It's calendar time.

1045
02:01:24,275 --> 02:01:26,503
Calendar time for Buddy.

1046
02:01:26,803 --> 02:01:30,348
- Ok. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

1047
02:01:30,448 --> 02:01:32,366
No, you're n...

1048
02:01:32,567 --> 02:01:34,819
You don't even know what
fucking day you work.

1049
02:01:34,919 --> 02:01:36,704
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

1050
02:01:36,804 --> 02:01:39,757
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

1051
02:01:39,857 --> 02:01:41,926
- Working Thursday?
- Yeah.

1052
02:01:42,026 --> 02:01:43,550
I don't think so.

1053
02:01:44,251 --> 02:01:45,480
Friday.

1054
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:48,316
- I don't...
- There's your name.

1055
02:01:48,616 --> 02:01:51,477
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. Ok?

1056
02:01:51,577 --> 02:01:53,272
Saturday. There used
to be your name.

1057
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,399
Oh.

1058
02:01:54,472 --> 02:01:55,748
Monday...

1059
02:01:56,624 --> 02:01:58,100
Here. How about that?

1060
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:02,067
Fucking with your cash is the only
thing you kids seem to understand.

1061
02:02:02,268 --> 02:02:03,323
Ok?

1062
02:02:04,298 --> 02:02:06,734
Now, I want you to go
home till I call you.

1063
02:02:06,834 --> 02:02:09,037
Till I call you.

1064
02:02:09,537 --> 02:02:13,124
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

1065
02:02:14,559 --> 02:02:16,119
And...

1066
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,230
for the hat.

1067
02:02:20,231 --> 02:02:22,175
That fucking hat.

1068
02:02:22,275 --> 02:02:25,653
That fucking...

1069
02:02:26,237 --> 02:02:28,857
How many times have I told you,

1070
02:02:29,157 --> 02:02:33,244
don't wear that fucking
hat here? How many?

1071
02:02:37,757 --> 02:02:39,433
Customers wear hats.

1072
02:02:39,533 --> 02:02:41,903
Well, I'm not the boss
of the customers.

1073
02:02:42,003 --> 02:02:44,097
I'm the boss of you.

1074
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:45,990
And I'm telling you...

1075
02:02:46,090 --> 02:02:50,492
that I want you to keep that
shit-kicker hat at home.

1076
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:28,533
Yeah. Budd, honey, the
toilet is at it again.

1077
02:03:28,633 --> 02:03:31,136
There's shitty water
all over the floor.

1078
02:03:31,836 --> 02:03:33,006
Ok...

1079
02:03:34,007 --> 02:03:35,573
Rocket.

1080
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:38,851

that gentled you down
some, didn't it?

1103
02:07:32,293 --> 02:07:33,561
Yep.

1104
02:07:35,171 --> 02:07:39,323
Ain't nobody a badass with
a double dose of rock salt

1105
02:07:39,424 --> 02:07:41,235
dug deep in their tits.

1106
02:07:45,347 --> 02:07:48,768
Not having... tits...

1107
02:07:53,522 --> 02:07:55,591
as fine...

1108
02:07:55,691 --> 02:07:58,194
or as big as yours,

1109
02:07:58,861 --> 02:08:03,365
I can't even imagine how
bad that shit must sting.

1110
02:08:07,244 --> 02:08:08,245
Yet...

1111
02:08:12,917 --> 02:08:15,169
I don't want to, neither.

1112
02:08:36,482 --> 02:08:38,609
I win.

1113
02:09:50,973 --> 02:09:52,099
Bill.

1114
02:09:53,184 --> 02:09:55,711
Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.

1115
02:09:55,811 --> 02:09:58,439
- Budd.
- Bingo.

1116
02:10:00,232 --> 02:10:02,693
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

1117
02:10:03,819 --> 02:10:07,656
I just caught me the cowgirl
ain't never been caught.

1118
02:10:09,408 --> 02:10:13,120
- Did you kill her?
- Well, not yet, I ain't.

1119
02:10:13,605 --> 02:10:16,107
I shot her full of rock salt.

1120
02:10:16,207 --> 02:10:18,170
She's so gentle right now,

1121
02:10:18,271 --> 02:10:21,203
I could perform her coup
de grâce with a rock.

1122
02:10:22,129 --> 02:10:23,839
Anywho...

1123
02:10:27,468 --> 02:10:30,704
Guess what I'm holding
in my hand right now?

1124
02:10:30,804 --> 02:10:31,889
What?

1125
02:10:31,989 --> 02:10:36,218
A brand spanking new
Hattori Hanzo sword.

1126
02:10:37,519 --> 02:10:39,730
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

1127
02:10:40,731 --> 02:10:42,966
that's what I call sharp.

1128
02:10:43,307 --> 02:10:44,516
How much?

1129
02:10:44,726 --> 02:10:47,258
Oh, that's hard to say,
being that it's...

1130
02:10:47,809 --> 02:10:49,118
priceless and all.

1131
02:10:49,598 --> 02:10:51,104
What's the terms?

1132
02:10:51,784 --> 02:10:55,070
You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...

1133
02:10:56,163 --> 02:10:58,874
with a million dollars
in folding cash...

1134
02:11:00,292 --> 02:11:02,181
and I'll give you...

1135
02:11:02,482 --> 02:11:05,514
the greatest sword
ever made by a man.

1136
02:11:09,677 --> 02:11:11,662
Now, how do you like
the sound of that?

1137
02:11:11,762 --> 02:11:13,372
Sounds like we got a deal.

1138
02:11:13,472 --> 02:11:16,458
- One condition.
- What?

1139
02:11:16,558 --> 02:11:20,171
She must suffer to
her last breath.

1140
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:21,563
Well...

1141
02:11:22,815 --> 02:11:25,150
That, Elle darling...

1142
02:11:25,859 --> 02:11:28,779
I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

1143
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:31,790
Then I'll see you in the morning,

1144
02:11:31,991 --> 02:11:33,459
millionaire.

1145
02:11:33,659 --> 02:11:34,919
All right.

1146
02:12:36,472 --> 02:12:38,098
Wakey, wakey.

1147
02:12:38,891 --> 02:12:40,351
Eggs and bakey.

1148
02:13:15,636 --> 02:13:17,221
I'm done.

1149
02:13:18,097 --> 02:13:20,682
Get me outta this hole.

1150
02:13:23,769 --> 02:13:25,104
Good.

1151
02:13:58,128 --> 02:13:59,955
Whoa, look at those eyes.

1152
02:14:00,055 --> 02:14:02,099
This bitch is furious.

1153
02:14:04,226 --> 02:14:05,961
What did I tell ya?

1154
02:14:07,062 --> 02:14:10,341
Is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

1155
02:14:10,841 --> 02:14:11,865
Or...

1156
02:14:12,366 --> 02:14:15,036
is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

1157
02:14:15,136 --> 02:14:16,645
I seen better.

1158
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:24,830
You got anything to say?

1159
02:14:26,457 --> 02:14:29,693
White women call this,
"The silent treatment."

1160
02:14:29,793 --> 02:14:32,129
And we let 'em think
we don't like it.

1161
02:14:37,384 --> 02:14:40,053
You grab the feet,
I'll get the head.

1162
02:14:47,906 --> 02:14:51,309
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1163
02:14:51,398 --> 02:14:53,901
Wiggle worm, you see this?

1164
02:14:55,194 --> 02:14:57,196
You see it, don't ya?

1165
02:14:59,406 --> 02:15:01,033
That's a can of Mace.

1166
02:15:02,916 --> 02:15:03,977
No.

1167
02:15:04,077 --> 02:15:07,147
You're going underneath
the ground tonight.

1168
02:15:07,247 --> 02:15:11,001
And... that's all there is to it.

1169
02:15:14,338 --> 02:15:16,757
I wanna bury ya.

1170
02:15:19,343 --> 02:15:22,221
I was gonna bury ya...

1171
02:15:27,643 --> 02:15:29,311
with this.

1172
02:15:32,981 --> 02:15:36,151
But if you're gonna act
like a horse's ass...

1173
02:15:38,445 --> 02:15:44,059
I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn
can right in your eyeballs.

1174
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:47,704
I'll burn 'em right outta
your fucking head.

1175
02:15:48,372 --> 02:15:51,150
Then you're gonna be blind...

1176
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:53,669
and burning...

1177
02:15:55,837 --> 02:15:57,589
and buried alive.

1178
02:16:03,136 --> 02:16:05,222
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

1179
02:16:16,108 --> 02:16:18,610
That's a wise decision.

1180
02:16:31,665 --> 02:16:34,668
This is for breaking
my brother's heart.

1181
02:20:23,647 --> 02:20:25,458
Once upon a time...

1182
02:20:26,441 --> 02:20:27,984
in China...

1183
02:20:29,277 --> 02:20:30,797
some believe...

1184
02:20:31,098 --> 02:20:32,723
around the year...

1185
02:20:32,823 --> 02:20:35,659
one, double aught, three,

1186
02:20:36,827 --> 02:20:40,040
head priest of the
White Lotus Clan,

1187
02:20:40,041 --> 02:20:43,166
Pai Mei, was walking
down a road...

1188
02:20:44,292 --> 02:20:46,319
contemplating whatever it is

1189
02:20:46,419 --> 02:20:52,325
that a man of Pai Mei's infinite
powers would contemplate,

1190
02:20:52,425 --> 02:20:55,679
which is another way of
saying, "Who knows?",

1191
02:20:57,013 --> 02:21:00,125
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

1192
02:21:00,225 --> 02:21:02,961
travelling in the
opposite direction.

1193
02:21:03,061 --> 02:21:06,481
As the monk and the
priest crossed paths...

1194
02:21:07,482 --> 02:21:09,509
Pai Mei...

1195
02:21:09,609 --> 02:21:14,931
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

1196
02:21:15,031 --> 02:21:18,243
gave the monk the
slightest of nods.

1197
02:21:20,328 --> 02:21:22,272
The nod...

1198
02:21:22,372 --> 02:21:24,291
was not returned.

1199
02:21:28,119 --> 02:21:29,940
Now, was it the intention...

1200
02:21:30,341 --> 02:21:33,149
of the Shaolin monk
to insult Pai Mei?

1201
02:21:34,175 --> 02:21:38,731
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

1202
02:21:39,431 --> 02:21:43,994
The motives of the
monk remain unknown.

1203
02:21:44,394 --> 02:21:46,063
What is known...

1204
02:21:46,563 --> 02:21:48,781
were the consequences.

1205
02:22:01,369 --> 02:22:06,333
The next morning, Pai Mei
appeared at the Shaolin temple...

1206
02:22:07,542 --> 02:22:10,695
and demanded of the
temple's head abbot

1207
02:22:10,795 --> 02:22:16,301
that he offer Pai Mei his
neck to repay the insult.

1208
02:22:17,552 --> 02:22:21,957
The abbot, at first, tried
to console Pai Mei.

1209
02:22:22,057 --> 02:22:25,060
Only to find Pai Mei was...

1210
02:22:26,061 --> 02:22:27,771
inconsolable.

1211
02:22:39,074 --> 02:22:40,934
So began...

1212
02:22:41,034 --> 02:22:44,198
the Massacre of the
Shaolin Temple,

1213
02:22:44,199 --> 02:22:47,274
and all sixty of the monks inside,

1214
02:22:47,374 --> 02:22:49,459
at the fists of the White Lotus.

1215
02:22:51,086 --> 02:22:54,573
And... so began the legend...

1216
02:22:54,673 --> 02:22:59,327
of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

1217
02:22:59,427 --> 02:23:01,621
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

1218
02:23:01,721 --> 02:23:04,332
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

1219
02:23:04,432 --> 02:23:08,603
the deadliest blow in
all of martial arts.

1220
02:23:10,981 --> 02:23:14,342
He hits you with his fingertips...

1221
02:23:14,442 --> 02:23:18,388
at five different pressure
points on your body...

1222
02:23:18,488 --> 02:23:21,408
and then lets you walk away.

1223
02:23:22,575 --> 02:23:25,520
But once you've
taken five steps...

1224
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:29,608
your heart explodes
inside your body...

1225
02:23:29,708 --> 02:23:32,861
and you fall to the floor, dead.

1226
02:23:32,961 --> 02:23:36,089
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

1227
02:23:37,966 --> 02:23:40,551
He teaches no one
the Five-Point-Palm

1228
02:23:40,552 --> 02:23:42,387
Exploding-Heart Technique.

1229
02:23:43,054 --> 02:23:45,081
Now...

1230
02:23:45,181 --> 02:23:48,835
one of the things I've
always liked about you...

1231
02:23:48,935 --> 02:23:50,437
Kiddo...

1232
02:23:52,147 --> 02:23:55,025
is you appear wise
beyond your years.

1233
02:23:59,029 --> 02:24:02,782
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

1234
02:24:03,783 --> 02:24:05,226
Whatever...

1235
02:24:05,326 --> 02:24:09,831
whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

1236
02:24:10,832 --> 02:24:13,527
If you flash him,
even for an instant,

1237
02:24:13,528 --> 02:24:15,946
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

1238
02:24:16,046 --> 02:24:21,242
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

1239
02:24:21,342 --> 02:24:24,596
he'll snap your back and your
neck like they were twigs.

1240
02:24:27,974 --> 02:24:30,852
And that will be the story of you.

1241
02:24:51,081 --> 02:24:53,608
He'll accept you as his student.

1242
02:24:53,708 --> 02:24:55,777
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1243
02:24:55,877 --> 02:24:58,697
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

1244
02:24:58,797 --> 02:25:00,448
Why did he accept me?

1245
02:25:00,548 --> 02:25:04,828
Because he's a very,
very, very old man.

1246
02:25:04,928 --> 02:25:07,138
And like all rotten bastards...

1247
02:25:08,139 --> 02:25:11,810
when they become old,
they get lonely.

1248
02:25:13,478 --> 02:25:16,339
Which has no effect on
their dispositions,

1249
02:25:16,439 --> 02:25:20,026
but it does teach them
the value of company.

1250
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:23,507
Whew. Oh.

1251
02:25:23,947 --> 02:25:28,243
Just seeing those steps
again makes me ache.

1252
02:25:29,202 --> 02:25:30,687
You're gonna have a lot of fun

1253
02:25:30,787 --> 02:25:34,290
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

1254
02:25:39,254 --> 02:25:41,197
When will I see you again?

1255
02:25:41,297 --> 02:25:44,701
That's the title of my favourite
soul song of the seventies.

1256
02:25:44,801 --> 02:25:46,803
- What?
- Nothing.

1257
02:25:47,637 --> 02:25:50,165
When he tells me you're done.

1258
02:25:50,265 --> 02:25:52,042
When do you think that might be?

1259
02:25:52,142 --> 02:25:55,045
That, my dearest, depends
entirely on you.

1260
02:25:55,145 --> 02:25:58,631
Now remember, no
sarcasm, no backtalk.

1261
02:25:58,731 --> 02:26:01,067
At least not for the
first year or so.

1262
02:26:01,192 --> 02:26:04,387
You're gonna have to let
him warm up to you.

1263
02:26:04,687 --> 02:26:08,258
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

1264
02:26:08,358 --> 02:26:11,402
and has nothing but
contempt for women.

1265
02:26:13,780 --> 02:26:17,158
So, in your case... it
might take a little while.

1266
02:26:17,992 --> 02:26:20,828
Adiós.

1267
02:28:00,421 --> 02:28:01,513
Master...

1268
02:28:03,191 --> 02:28:05,056
Your Mandarin is lousy.

1269
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:09,154
It causes my ears discomfort.
You bray like an donkey.

1270
02:28:09,730 --> 02:28:12,324
You are not to speak
unless spoken to.

1271
02:28:12,767 --> 02:28:16,567
Is it too much to hope you
understand Cantonese?

1272
02:28:19,907 --> 02:28:21,499
I speak Japanese very well...

1273
02:28:21,976 --> 02:28:24,870
I didn't ask if you
speak Japanese,

1274
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:26,846
I asked if you
understood Cantonese?

1275
02:28:28,493 --> 02:28:29,692
A little.

1276
02:28:30,084 --> 02:28:34,381
You are here to learn
Kung Fu, not linguistics.

1277
02:28:34,989 --> 02:28:36,923
If you can't understand me,

1278
02:28:37,158 --> 02:28:39,353
I will communicate with
you like I would a dog.

1279
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:41,957
When I yell, when I point,

1280
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:43,754
when I beat you with my stick.

1281
02:28:48,703 --> 02:28:50,864
Bill is your master, is he not?

1282
02:28:52,463 --> 02:28:53,663
Yes, he is.

1283
02:28:56,377 --> 02:29:00,313
He tells me you're not
entirely unschooled.

1284
02:29:01,315 --> 02:29:03,010
What is your training?

1285
02:29:03,087 --> 02:29:05,472
I am proficient in
Tiger-Crane Style,

1286
02:29:05,473 --> 02:29:07,168
and I am more than proficient

1287
02:29:07,170 --> 02:29:09,774
in the exquisite art
of the Samurai sword.

1288
02:29:11,459 --> 02:29:13,926
"The exquisite art of
the samurai sword."

1289
02:29:14,427 --> 02:29:16,027
Don't make me laugh.

1290
02:29:16,395 --> 02:29:18,987
Your so-called exquisite
art, is only fit for...

1291
02:29:19,066 --> 02:29:21,434
Japanese fatheads.

1292
02:29:26,007 --> 02:29:28,840
Your anger amuses me.

1293
02:29:29,176 --> 02:29:31,474
Do you believe you are my match?

1294
02:29:31,912 --> 02:29:32,912
No.

1295
02:29:33,347 --> 02:29:35,247
Are you aware I kill at will?

1296
02:29:36,117 --> 02:29:37,117
Yes.

1297
02:29:37,652 --> 02:29:38,710
Is it your wish to die?

1298
02:29:39,287 --> 02:29:40,287
No.

1299
02:29:41,856 --> 02:29:42,856
Then you must be stupid...

1300
02:29:43,291 --> 02:29:44,952
Then you must be
stupid... so stupid.

1301
02:29:45,493 --> 02:29:49,293
Rise, and let me look at
your ridiculous face.

1302
02:29:49,730 --> 02:29:50,730
Rise.

1303
02:29:55,336 --> 02:29:56,928
So, my pathetic friend,

1304
02:29:57,905 --> 02:30:00,772
is there anything
that you can do well?

1305
02:30:01,876 --> 02:30:03,241
What's the matter?

1306
02:30:04,145 --> 02:30:06,010
Cat got your tongue?

1307
02:30:07,315 --> 02:30:10,648
Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

1308
02:30:11,052 --> 02:30:12,052
I despise the goddamn Japs.

1309
02:30:15,756 --> 02:30:16,756
Go to that rack.

1310
02:30:25,633 --> 02:30:26,633
Remove the sword.

1311
02:30:52,993 --> 02:30:54,858
Let's see how good you really are.

1312
02:30:55,696 --> 02:30:56,720
If...

1313
02:30:57,798 --> 02:30:59,459
you land a single blow,

1314
02:31:01,469 --> 02:31:03,113
I'll bow down and
call you "master."

1315
02:31:17,551 --> 02:31:20,213
From here you can get an
excellent view of my foot.

1316
02:31:24,925 --> 02:31:28,417
Your swordsmanship
is amateur at best.

1317
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:48,107
Your so-called kung-fu is
really quite pathetic.

1318
02:31:50,618 --> 02:31:54,520
I asked you to demonstrate
what you know and you did...

1319
02:31:55,089 --> 02:31:56,181
Not a goddamn thing.

1320
02:31:57,358 --> 02:32:01,727
Let's see your Tiger-Crane
match my Eagle's Claw.

1321
02:32:58,018 --> 02:32:59,781
Like all Yankee women,

1322
02:33:00,321 --> 02:33:02,084
all you can do is order
in restaurants...

1323
02:33:02,223 --> 02:33:03,656
and spend a man's money.

1324
02:33:04,859 --> 02:33:06,326
Excruciating, isn't it?

1325
02:33:06,794 --> 02:33:07,852
Yes.

1326
02:33:09,263 --> 02:33:10,821
If it was my wish...

1327
02:33:11,165 --> 02:33:12,598
I could chop your arm off.

1328
02:33:12,744 --> 02:33:14,010
No, please don't.

1329
02:33:15,269 --> 02:33:17,736
It's my arm now. I can
do what I please.

1330
02:33:18,437 --> 02:33:20,638
If you can stop me,
I suggest you try.

1331
02:33:22,660 --> 02:33:23,960
I can't.

1332
02:33:25,045 --> 02:33:26,171
Because you're helpless?

1333
02:33:27,247 --> 02:33:28,247
Yes.

1334
02:33:30,451 --> 02:33:32,612
Have you ever felt this before?

1335
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:34,220
No.

1336
02:33:34,388 --> 02:33:35,912
Compared to me,

1337
02:33:36,023 --> 02:33:37,718
you're as helpless as a
worm fighting an eagle?

1338
02:33:38,659 --> 02:33:39,659
Yes.

1339
02:33:41,862 --> 02:33:42,862
That's the beginning.

1340
02:33:48,536 --> 02:33:50,902
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

1341
02:33:53,468 --> 02:33:54,468
Yes.

1342
02:33:57,011 --> 02:33:59,809
Your training will begin tomorrow.

1343
02:34:08,589 --> 02:34:09,920
Since your arm now
belongs to me...

1344
02:34:10,858 --> 02:34:12,086
I want it strong.

1345
02:34:13,761 --> 02:34:15,126
Can you do that?

1346
02:34:16,764 --> 02:34:18,061
I can, but not that close.

1347
02:34:18,566 --> 02:34:19,566
Then you can't do it.

1348
02:34:20,834 --> 02:34:25,771
What if your enemy is three
inches in front of you?

1349
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:26,964
What do you do then?

1350
02:34:28,342 --> 02:34:29,400
Curl into a ball,

1351
02:34:30,778 --> 02:34:33,246
or do you put your
fist through him?

1352
02:34:33,948 --> 02:34:34,948
Now begin.

1353
02:35:06,914 --> 02:35:09,382
It's the wood that
should fear your hand,

1354
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:10,812
not the other way around.

1355
02:35:11,719 --> 02:35:13,448
No wonder you can't do it,

1356
02:35:14,154 --> 02:35:17,954
you acquiesce to defeat,
before you even begin.

1357
02:37:06,333 --> 02:37:08,301
If you want to eat like a dog,

1358
02:37:09,803 --> 02:37:11,998
you can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

1359
02:37:14,441 --> 02:37:16,841
If you want to live and
sleep like a human,

1360
02:37:18,045 --> 02:37:19,045
pick up those sticks.

1361
02:40:50,047 --> 02:40:52,883
Come on, you bitch.

1362
02:41:34,466 --> 02:41:37,260
Ok, Pai Mei.

1363
02:41:39,221 --> 02:41:41,223
Here I come.

1364
02:43:50,393 --> 02:43:53,396
May I have a glass
of water, please?

1365
02:46:31,721 --> 02:46:35,934
- So that's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

1366
02:46:36,726 --> 02:46:38,962
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

1367
02:46:39,062 --> 02:46:42,007
That's a pretty
fucked up way to die.

1368
02:46:42,107 --> 02:46:44,734
What's the name on the
grave she's buried under?

1369
02:46:45,443 --> 02:46:46,861
Paula...

1370
02:46:48,905 --> 02:46:50,949
Schultz.

1371
02:46:56,121 --> 02:46:57,772
Can I look at the sword?

1372
02:46:57,872 --> 02:47:01,318
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

1373
02:47:01,418 --> 02:47:03,294
It sure is.

1374
02:47:04,087 --> 02:47:06,798
Well then, it's your sword now.

1375
02:47:25,525 --> 02:47:27,677
What's that you said?

1376
02:47:27,777 --> 02:47:30,388
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

1377
02:47:30,488 --> 02:47:32,557
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

1378
02:47:32,657 --> 02:47:35,577
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

1379
02:47:36,995 --> 02:47:39,105
Yeah, once.

1380
02:47:39,205 --> 02:47:41,791
Yeah? How does this
one compare to that?

1381
02:47:51,009 --> 02:47:54,637
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

1382
02:47:56,181 --> 02:47:59,876
you compare it to every
other sword ever made,

1383
02:47:59,976 --> 02:48:04,189
wasn't made, by Hattori Hanzo.

1384
02:48:12,864 --> 02:48:16,117
Here you go. Wrap your
lips around that.

1385
02:48:25,251 --> 02:48:27,253
So...

1386
02:48:28,004 --> 02:48:30,048
which "R" are you filled with?

1387
02:48:31,132 --> 02:48:32,417
What?

1388
02:48:35,804 --> 02:48:37,330
They say...

1389
02:48:37,430 --> 02:48:40,041
the number one killer...

1390
02:48:40,141 --> 02:48:41,960
of old people...

1391
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:43,645
is retirement.

1392
02:48:45,605 --> 02:48:47,387
People got a job to do,

1393
02:48:47,488 --> 02:48:51,794
they tend to live a little bit
longer so they can do it.

1394
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:55,640
I've always figured that...

1395
02:48:55,740 --> 02:48:58,601
warriors and their enemies...

1396
02:48:58,701 --> 02:49:01,479
share the same relationship.

1397
02:49:01,579 --> 02:49:04,315
So now that you're not gonna
have to face your enemy no more

1398
02:49:04,415 --> 02:49:07,168
on the battlefield...

1399
02:49:08,169 --> 02:49:11,589
which "R" ya filled with?

1400
02:49:13,091 --> 02:49:14,592
Relief...

1401
02:49:17,595 --> 02:49:19,430
or regret?

1402
02:49:21,099 --> 02:49:24,853
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

1403
02:49:26,646 --> 02:49:29,549
I'm sure you do feel a
little bit of both.

1404
02:49:29,649 --> 02:49:33,094
But I know damn well
that you feel one...

1405
02:49:33,194 --> 02:49:35,930
more than you feel the other.

1406
02:49:36,030 --> 02:49:41,411
Which one is it?

1407
02:49:42,412 --> 02:49:43,746
Regret.

1408
02:49:45,456 --> 02:49:47,859
You know, you gotta hand
it to the old girl.

1409
02:49:47,959 --> 02:49:52,471
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

1410
02:49:52,797 --> 02:49:54,866
Bill thought she
was so damn smart.

1411
02:49:54,966 --> 02:49:56,801
And I tried to tell him...

1412
02:49:57,385 --> 02:49:59,762
she was just smart for a blond.

1413
02:50:19,699 --> 02:50:21,826
Thanks a bunch.

1414
02:50:33,630 --> 02:50:35,089
All right.

1415
02:51:07,205 --> 02:51:08,648
I'm sorry, Budd.

1416
02:51:08,748 --> 02:51:11,359
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

1417
02:51:11,459 --> 02:51:15,572
Budd, I'd like to introduce
my friend, the black mamba.

1418
02:51:15,672 --> 02:51:18,716
Black mamba, this is Budd.

1419
02:51:19,384 --> 02:51:21,202
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

1420
02:51:21,302 --> 02:51:23,313
I looked him up on the Internet.

1421
02:51:23,513 --> 02:51:26,791
Fascinating creature,
the black mamba.

1422
02:51:26,891 --> 02:51:28,184
Listen to this:

1423
02:51:33,523 --> 02:51:35,675
In Africa, the saying goes,

1424
02:51:35,775 --> 02:51:39,971
'In the bush, an elephant can
kill you, a leopard can kill you,

1425
02:51:40,071 --> 02:51:44,142
'and a black mamba can kill
you. But only with the mamba,

1426
02:51:44,242 --> 02:51:46,613
and this has been
true in Africa since

1427
02:51:46,614 --> 02:51:48,688
the dawn of time, is death sure. '

1428
02:51:48,788 --> 02:51:55,545
Hence its handle, "Death
Incarnate." Pretty cool, huh?

1429
02:51:56,921 --> 02:52:00,658
Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

1430
02:52:00,758 --> 02:52:04,037
acting on the nervous
system, causing paralysis.

1431
02:52:04,137 --> 02:52:07,665
The venom of a black mamba can
kill a human being in four hours

1432
02:52:07,765 --> 02:52:10,501
if, say, bitten on the
ankle or the thumb.

1433
02:52:10,601 --> 02:52:13,922
However, a bite to
the face or torso

1434
02:52:14,022 --> 02:52:17,717
can bring death from
paralysis within 20 minutes.

1435
02:52:17,817 --> 02:52:20,912
Now, you should listen to this,
because this concerns you.

1436
02:52:22,905 --> 02:52:25,934
The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

1437
02:52:26,034 --> 02:52:28,102
can be gargantuan.

1438
02:52:29,162 --> 02:52:31,606
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

1439
02:52:31,706 --> 02:52:34,726
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

1440
02:52:35,626 --> 02:52:37,946
If not treated quickly
with anti-venom,

1441
02:52:38,046 --> 02:52:40,865
ten to 15 milligrams can
be fatal to human beings.

1442
02:52:40,965 --> 02:52:43,368
However, the black
mamba can deliver

1443
02:52:43,468 --> 02:52:48,389
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite.

1444
02:52:51,601 --> 02:52:53,311
Now...

1445
02:52:54,645 --> 02:52:58,800
in these last agonising minutes
of life you have left,

1446
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:02,195
let me answer that question you
asked earlier more thoroughly.

1447
02:53:05,990 --> 02:53:07,992
Right at this moment...

1448
02:53:08,659 --> 02:53:11,871
the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

1449
02:53:13,956 --> 02:53:19,862
Regret that maybe the greatest
warrior I have ever met

1450
02:53:19,962 --> 02:53:25,994
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhacking, scrub,

1451
02:53:26,094 --> 02:53:29,180
alkie, piece of shit like you.

1452
02:53:31,974 --> 02:53:34,310
That woman deserved better.

1453
02:54:18,396 --> 02:54:19,564
Bill...

1454
02:54:21,232 --> 02:54:23,234
I have some tragic news.

1455
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:26,487
Your brother's dead.

1456
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:29,157
I am so sorry, baby.

1457
02:54:30,241 --> 02:54:33,603
She put a black mamba
in his camper.

1458
02:54:33,703 --> 02:54:36,247
I got her, sweetie. She's dead.

1459
02:54:38,749 --> 02:54:40,526
Let me put it this way:

1460
02:54:40,626 --> 02:54:43,095
You ever start
feeling sentimental,

1461
02:54:43,096 --> 02:54:44,947
go to Barstow, California.

1462
02:54:45,047 --> 02:54:46,795
When you get here, walk into a

1463
02:54:46,796 --> 02:54:48,951
florist and buy a
bunch of flowers.

1464
02:54:49,051 --> 02:54:51,954
Then you take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

1465
02:54:52,054 --> 02:54:53,511
on Fuller and Guadalupe,

1466
02:54:53,612 --> 02:54:56,309
look for the headstone
marked "Paula Schultz,"

1467
02:54:56,409 --> 02:54:58,419
and lay them on the grave.

1468
02:54:58,519 --> 02:55:02,312
Because you will be standing
at the final resting place

1469
02:55:02,413 --> 02:55:04,510
of Beatrix Kiddo.

1470
02:55:04,609 --> 02:55:07,053
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

1471
02:55:07,153 --> 02:55:08,721
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

1472
02:55:08,821 --> 02:55:11,516
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

1473
02:55:11,616 --> 02:55:14,894
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

1474
02:55:14,994 --> 02:55:16,746
Do you want me to come over?

1475
02:55:17,538 --> 02:55:20,541
No, no, no. You need
me, baby, I'm there.

1476
02:55:23,628 --> 02:55:26,447
Ok. I'm leaving now.

1477
02:55:26,547 --> 02:55:29,759
You go smoke some pot or
something. I'll be there soon.

1478
02:56:33,114 --> 02:56:34,615
Gross.

1479
02:57:58,157 --> 02:58:02,578
"To my brother, Budd. The
only man I ever loved. Bill."

1480
02:58:14,131 --> 02:58:15,716
What's that?

1481
02:58:17,927 --> 02:58:20,413
Budd's Hanzo sword.

1482
02:58:20,513 --> 02:58:22,999
He said he pawned it.

1483
02:58:23,099 --> 02:58:26,727
Guess that makes him a
liar now, don't it?

1484
02:58:30,189 --> 02:58:33,067
- Elle?
- Bea.

1485
02:58:33,943 --> 02:58:36,971
Something I've always
been curious about.

1486
02:58:37,071 --> 02:58:39,532
Just between us girls...

1487
02:58:40,825 --> 02:58:45,313
what did you say to Pai Mei to
make him snatch out your eye?

1488
02:58:49,083 --> 02:58:52,320
I called him a miserable old fool.

1489
02:58:52,420 --> 02:58:57,450
Ooh. Bad idea.

1490
02:58:57,550 --> 02:58:59,343
Know what I did?

1491
02:58:59,885 --> 02:59:03,597
I killed that miserable old fool.

1492
02:59:05,516 --> 02:59:08,294
How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

1493
02:59:08,394 --> 02:59:10,921
I poisoned his fish heads.

1494
02:59:11,042 --> 02:59:13,147
Elle, you treacherous bitch.

1495
02:59:21,740 --> 02:59:22,933
And I told him,

1496
02:59:23,033 --> 02:59:26,937
"To me, the word of
an old fool like you

1497
02:59:27,037 --> 02:59:31,041
is worth less than nothing."

1498
02:59:35,880 --> 02:59:37,782
That's right.

1499
02:59:37,882 --> 02:59:39,950
I killed your master.

1500
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:42,661
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

1501
02:59:42,761 --> 02:59:45,289
With your own sword, no less.

1502
02:59:45,389 --> 02:59:51,061
Which, in the very immediate
future, will become my sword.

1503
02:59:53,731 --> 02:59:55,232
Bitch...

1504
02:59:56,066 --> 02:59:58,444
you don't have a future.

1505
03:00:45,991 --> 03:00:49,119
Fucking bitch.

1506
03:00:51,789 --> 03:00:53,666
Fucking bitch.

1507
03:01:02,299 --> 03:01:06,262
I'll kill you.
You're fucking dead.

1508
03:01:07,137 --> 03:01:11,058
You bitch. You bitch.

1509
03:01:15,813 --> 03:01:17,898
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch.

1510
03:01:20,442 --> 03:01:22,820
Oh, I'll get you.

1511
03:01:24,863 --> 03:01:26,375
I'm gonna...

1512
03:01:27,575 --> 03:01:30,869
Where are you? Lemme
fucking at you.

1513
03:01:32,913 --> 03:01:36,567
Where are you? I'm coming,
you fucking bitch.

1514
03:01:36,667 --> 03:01:39,503
You're fucking dead. You're dead.

1515
03:01:41,672 --> 03:01:45,384
Oh... shit.

1516
03:03:58,129 --> 03:04:00,424
Like most men who never
knew their father,

1517
03:04:00,524 --> 03:04:02,801
Bill collected father figures.

1518
03:04:02,901 --> 03:04:05,929
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

1519
03:04:06,029 --> 03:04:09,975
Esteban was a pimp and a
friend of Bill's mother.

1520
03:04:10,075 --> 03:04:14,104
He ran a brothel in Acuna,
Mexico, for over 50 years.

1521
03:04:14,904 --> 03:04:17,348
His army, the Acuna Boys,

1522
03:04:17,448 --> 03:04:20,358
made up of the fatherless
offspring of his whores,

1523
03:04:20,459 --> 03:04:21,728
ran Acuna.

1524
03:04:21,828 --> 03:04:24,163
He ran the Acuna Boys.

1525
03:04:26,998 --> 03:04:28,610
Now, at the age of 80,

1526
03:04:28,711 --> 03:04:31,903
it would be this retired
gentleman of leisure

1527
03:04:32,003 --> 03:04:35,340
who could point me
in Bill's direction.

1528
03:04:37,050 --> 03:04:39,177
Señor Esteban Vihaio?

1529
03:04:41,054 --> 03:04:42,372
Yes.

1530
03:04:42,472 --> 03:04:44,474
May I join you?

1531
03:04:46,518 --> 03:04:49,713
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

1532
03:04:49,813 --> 03:04:54,401
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

1533
03:04:58,539 --> 03:04:59,973
Americana?

1534
03:05:00,073 --> 03:05:01,767
Yes.

1535
03:05:01,867 --> 03:05:04,645
I speak a little
Spanish, if you prefer.

1536
03:05:04,745 --> 03:05:06,283
No, no, no, no.

1537
03:05:06,384 --> 03:05:08,231
I prefer English.

1538
03:05:08,331 --> 03:05:10,901
I haven't spoken it in a while,

1539
03:05:11,001 --> 03:05:14,321
but I would relish the
opportunity to converse

1540
03:05:14,421 --> 03:05:17,282
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

1541
03:05:17,382 --> 03:05:19,643
It's my pleasure to
be in the company

1542
03:05:19,644 --> 03:05:21,903
of such a fine
gentleman as yourself.

1543
03:05:22,003 --> 03:05:24,581
I must warn you, young lady...

1544
03:05:24,681 --> 03:05:27,893
I am susceptible to flattery.

1545
03:05:30,771 --> 03:05:32,939
How may I be of service to you?

1546
03:05:41,198 --> 03:05:43,033
Where's Bill?

1547
03:05:48,038 --> 03:05:50,165
You must be Beatrix.

1548
03:05:52,167 --> 03:05:54,377
I can see the attraction.

1549
03:05:56,880 --> 03:06:00,360
I remember when Bill was
only five years old,

1550
03:06:00,461 --> 03:06:02,285
I took him to the movies.

1551
03:06:02,385 --> 03:06:06,039
It was a movie
starring Lana Turner.

1552
03:06:06,139 --> 03:06:10,352
The Postman Always Ring
Twice, with John Garfields.

1553
03:06:11,311 --> 03:06:14,464
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

1554
03:06:14,564 --> 03:06:17,092
Bill would begin compulsively to

1555
03:06:17,093 --> 03:06:20,095
suck his thumb to
an obscene amount.

1556
03:06:20,195 --> 03:06:25,909
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

1557
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:35,152
You know...

1558
03:06:35,252 --> 03:06:39,056
being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

1559
03:06:39,256 --> 03:06:41,942
is always the right thing to do.

1560
03:06:44,678 --> 03:06:49,199
If we had met when I was
back in business...

1561
03:06:49,599 --> 03:06:53,603
you would have been
my number one lady.

1562
03:06:56,606 --> 03:07:00,644
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

1563
03:07:02,571 --> 03:07:06,616
This... I heard you
were driving a truck.

1564
03:07:07,325 --> 03:07:09,369
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

1565
03:07:10,245 --> 03:07:12,014
The Pussy died.

1566
03:07:16,126 --> 03:07:19,187
Bill shot you in the head, no?

1567
03:07:19,287 --> 03:07:20,414
Yes.

1568
03:07:22,799 --> 03:07:25,911
I would have been much nicer.

1569
03:07:26,011 --> 03:07:28,430
I would have just cut your face.

1570
03:07:31,474 --> 03:07:33,126
You must forgive me.

1571
03:07:33,226 --> 03:07:36,021
Please... you have
a drink with me.

1572
03:07:39,024 --> 03:07:41,151
Clara.

1573
03:07:44,654 --> 03:07:46,156
Coming.

1574
03:07:48,825 --> 03:07:51,244
Two añejo.

1575
03:07:56,530 --> 03:07:57,929
Clarita

1576
03:08:03,673 --> 03:08:05,175
Thank you.

1577
03:08:06,907 --> 03:08:07,907
Tequila.

1578
03:08:10,388 --> 03:08:13,216
What were we talking about?

1579
03:08:19,731 --> 03:08:21,087
Bill.

1580
03:08:23,526 --> 03:08:27,430
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill?

1581
03:08:27,530 --> 03:08:28,782
Yeah.

1582
03:08:30,158 --> 03:08:34,537
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

1583
03:08:35,705 --> 03:08:38,208
I will draw you a map.

1584
03:08:39,626 --> 03:08:42,003
Bill is like a son to me.

1585
03:08:43,546 --> 03:08:47,617
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

1586
03:08:47,717 --> 03:08:49,736
Because he would want me to.

1587
03:08:51,054 --> 03:08:52,989
Now, that I don't believe.

1588
03:08:55,934 --> 03:08:59,729
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

1589
03:10:08,631 --> 03:10:10,200
Freeze, mommy.

1590
03:10:10,300 --> 03:10:13,053
Bang, bang. Oh.

1591
03:10:13,178 --> 03:10:14,537
Oh. She got us, B.B.

1592
03:10:14,637 --> 03:10:17,582
mommy got us. Oh, I'm dying.

1593
03:10:17,682 --> 03:10:19,726
I'm dying.

1594
03:10:22,312 --> 03:10:25,899
Fall down, sweetheart.
mommy shot us.

1595
03:10:27,942 --> 03:10:30,867
But little did
Quickdraw Kiddo know

1596
03:10:30,968 --> 03:10:33,974
that little B.B. was
only playing possum,

1597
03:10:34,074 --> 03:10:38,995
due to the fact that she
was impervious to bullets.

1598
03:10:39,095 --> 03:10:41,189
I am pervious to bullets, mommy.

1599
03:10:41,289 --> 03:10:42,796
Hey, get back down there.

1600
03:10:42,897 --> 03:10:44,401
- Hurry up.
- You're playing possum.

1601
03:10:45,001 --> 03:10:50,740
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

1602
03:10:50,840 --> 03:10:56,471
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

1603
03:10:58,139 --> 03:10:59,516
Bang, bang.

1604
03:11:07,440 --> 03:11:11,653
You're dead, mommy. So die.

1605
03:11:16,950 --> 03:11:18,368
B.B.

1606
03:11:21,913 --> 03:11:25,542
Oh. B.B...

1607
03:11:28,545 --> 03:11:30,755
I should've known.

1608
03:11:31,673 --> 03:11:34,551
You are... the best.

1609
03:11:41,933 --> 03:11:44,919
Oh, mommy. Don't die.

1610
03:11:45,019 --> 03:11:47,147
I was just playing.

1611
03:11:52,527 --> 03:11:54,070
I know.

1612
03:12:08,042 --> 03:12:10,246
I told her you were asleep...

1613
03:12:11,171 --> 03:12:15,750
but that one day you'd wake
up and come back to her.

1614
03:12:16,050 --> 03:12:17,601
And she asked me,

1615
03:12:17,702 --> 03:12:20,288
"If mommy's been asleep
since I was born,

1616
03:12:20,388 --> 03:12:23,083
then how will she know
what I look like?"

1617
03:12:23,183 --> 03:12:25,123
To which I replied,

1618
03:12:25,224 --> 03:12:29,298
"Because mommy's been
dreaming of you."

1619
03:12:30,773 --> 03:12:32,775
That's what I said.

1620
03:12:33,776 --> 03:12:37,097
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

1621
03:12:37,197 --> 03:12:41,684
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

1622
03:12:41,784 --> 03:12:46,122
I waited a long time for
you to wake up, mommy.

1623
03:12:58,200 --> 03:13:00,369
Now, let me look at you.

1624
03:13:06,926 --> 03:13:10,830
My, my, my, what a pretty
little girl you are.

1625
03:13:10,930 --> 03:13:12,848
You're pretty too, mommy.

1626
03:13:18,788 --> 03:13:22,083
Tell mommy what you said when
I showed you her picture.

1627
03:13:23,626 --> 03:13:26,112
Come on, shy girl.

1628
03:13:26,212 --> 03:13:28,865
Come on. You know what you said.

1629
03:13:28,965 --> 03:13:32,426
Come on. Tell mommy. It'll
make her feel good. Come on.

1630
03:13:34,770 --> 03:13:36,038
Yeah. Come on.

1631
03:13:36,038 --> 03:13:38,149
I said... I said,

1632
03:13:38,649 --> 03:13:41,945
"You're the most
beautifulest woman I

1633
03:13:41,946 --> 03:13:44,980
ever saw in the whole wide world."

1634
03:13:46,615 --> 03:13:50,394
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

1635
03:13:50,894 --> 03:13:54,913
Baby, don't you think mommy
has the prettiest hair

1636
03:13:55,014 --> 03:13:57,134
in the whole wide world?

1637
03:13:57,234 --> 03:13:58,298
Yes, I do.

1638
03:13:58,299 --> 03:14:01,490
Matter of fact, it's
better than pretty.

1639
03:14:02,390 --> 03:14:04,198
What's better than pretty?

1640
03:14:06,019 --> 03:14:07,228
Gorgeous.

1641
03:14:07,328 --> 03:14:13,109
Very good. Gorgeous.
mommy is gorgeous.

1642
03:14:16,851 --> 03:14:20,190
You know, sweetie, mommy's
kinda mad at Daddy.

1643
03:14:20,290 --> 03:14:22,852
Why, Daddy? Were you
being a bad daddy?

1644
03:14:22,952 --> 03:14:26,988
I'm afraid I was. I
was a real bad daddy.

1645
03:14:28,916 --> 03:14:33,195
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

1646
03:14:33,295 --> 03:14:37,508
Wanna tell mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

1647
03:14:39,468 --> 03:14:41,470
I killed him.

1648
03:14:42,471 --> 03:14:46,934
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfish.

1649
03:14:47,727 --> 03:14:50,157
She came running into
my room, holding

1650
03:14:50,158 --> 03:14:52,214
the fish in her hand and crying,

1651
03:14:52,314 --> 03:14:55,484
Daddy. Daddy. Emilio's dead.

1652
03:14:57,153 --> 03:15:00,890
And I said, "Really?
That's so sad."

1653
03:15:00,990 --> 03:15:03,225
How did he die?

1654
03:15:03,325 --> 03:15:06,646
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

1655
03:15:06,746 --> 03:15:11,901
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

1656
03:15:12,001 --> 03:15:14,754
I accidentally stepped on him.

1657
03:15:16,046 --> 03:15:17,823
To which I queried,

1658
03:15:17,923 --> 03:15:20,794
And just how did your
foot accidentally

1659
03:15:20,795 --> 03:15:23,454
find its way into
Emilio's fishbowl?

1660
03:15:23,554 --> 03:15:25,113
And she said, "No, no, no.

1661
03:15:25,214 --> 03:15:27,975
Emilio was on the carpet
when I stepped on him."

1662
03:15:28,975 --> 03:15:31,187
The plot thickens.

1663
03:15:31,896 --> 03:15:36,759
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

1664
03:15:36,859 --> 03:15:40,112
And, mommy, you would've
been so proud of her.

1665
03:15:42,573 --> 03:15:44,684
She didn't lie.

1666
03:15:44,784 --> 03:15:48,938
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

1667
03:15:49,038 --> 03:15:51,457
and put him on the carpet.

1668
03:15:54,126 --> 03:15:57,254
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

1669
03:15:58,255 --> 03:16:00,132
Flapping.

1670
03:16:00,966 --> 03:16:03,521
And then you stomped on him.

1671
03:16:05,221 --> 03:16:07,765
And when you lifted
up your foot...

1672
03:16:08,891 --> 03:16:12,837
- what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

1673
03:16:12,937 --> 03:16:15,898
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

1674
03:16:18,234 --> 03:16:20,027
She told me later...

1675
03:16:20,820 --> 03:16:23,180
that the second she
lifted up her foot

1676
03:16:23,280 --> 03:16:27,476
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

1677
03:16:27,576 --> 03:16:32,606
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death?

1678
03:16:32,706 --> 03:16:38,045
A fish flapping on the carpet, and
a fish not flapping on the carpet.

1679
03:16:40,047 --> 03:16:42,733
So powerful, even a four-year-old

1680
03:16:42,734 --> 03:16:45,745
with no concept of
life or death...

1681
03:16:45,845 --> 03:16:47,638
knew what it meant.

1682
03:16:48,889 --> 03:16:51,401
You loved Emilio, didn't you?

1683
03:16:52,601 --> 03:16:55,521
Well... I love mommy too.

1684
03:16:57,064 --> 03:16:59,341
But I did to mommy what
you did to Emilio.

1685
03:16:59,441 --> 03:17:03,262
- You stomped on mommy?
- Worse.

1686
03:17:03,362 --> 03:17:05,389
I shot mommy.

1687
03:17:05,489 --> 03:17:08,642
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

1688
03:17:08,742 --> 03:17:10,519
I shot her for real.

1689
03:17:10,619 --> 03:17:13,063
Why? Did you want to
see what would happen?

1690
03:17:13,163 --> 03:17:17,693
No, I knew what would happen
to mommy if I shot her.

1691
03:17:17,793 --> 03:17:20,235
What I didn't know
was, when I shot

1692
03:17:20,236 --> 03:17:22,406
mommy, what would happen to me.

1693
03:17:22,506 --> 03:17:26,343
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

1694
03:17:28,429 --> 03:17:30,581
And that's when I learned...

1695
03:17:30,681 --> 03:17:35,978
some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

1696
03:17:38,981 --> 03:17:44,136
- What happened to mommy?
- Why don't you ask mommy?

1697
03:17:44,236 --> 03:17:47,348
You ok, mommy? Does it hurt?

1698
03:17:47,448 --> 03:17:49,366
No, sweetie.

1699
03:17:51,243 --> 03:17:53,245
Doesn't hurt any more.

1700
03:17:59,335 --> 03:18:01,587
Did it make you sick?

1701
03:18:02,254 --> 03:18:06,742
No. It made me sleep.

1702
03:18:06,842 --> 03:18:09,912
That's why I haven't been with
you. B.B. I've been asleep.

1703
03:18:10,012 --> 03:18:12,848
But you're awake
now, mommy. Right?

1704
03:18:13,515 --> 03:18:16,794
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1705
03:18:16,894 --> 03:18:19,621
B.B., would you like
mommy to watch a

1706
03:18:19,622 --> 03:18:22,132
video with you before sleepy time?

1707
03:18:23,692 --> 03:18:27,179
mommy, do you want to watch a
video with me before sleepy time?

1708
03:18:27,279 --> 03:18:30,266
Oh, yeah. I would love to.

1709
03:18:30,366 --> 03:18:33,060
- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.

1710
03:18:33,160 --> 03:18:35,563
No, B.B. Shogun
Assassin is too long.

1711
03:18:38,163 --> 03:18:39,733
No, it's not.

1712
03:18:39,833 --> 03:18:44,546
Well, then, I'll leave
you ladies to it.

1713
03:18:51,053 --> 03:18:56,500
When I was little, my
father was famous.

1714
03:18:56,600 --> 03:19:00,796
He was the greatest
samurai in the empire.

1715
03:19:00,896 --> 03:19:04,174
And he was the
shogun's decapitator.

1716
03:19:04,274 --> 03:19:09,305
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

1717
03:19:09,405 --> 03:19:13,976
My father would come home to
Mother and when he would see her,

1718
03:19:14,076 --> 03:19:16,812
he would forget
about the killings.

1719
03:19:16,912 --> 03:19:21,984
He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.

1720
03:19:22,084 --> 03:19:24,737
Maybe that was the problem.

1721
03:19:24,837 --> 03:19:27,715

Quite a piece of work.

1757
03:21:56,697 --> 03:22:00,684
Speaking of which,
how is Hanzo-San?

1758
03:22:00,784 --> 03:22:02,244
He's good.

1759
03:22:04,246 --> 03:22:06,248
Has his sushi gotten any better?

1760
03:22:10,043 --> 03:22:15,115
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

1761
03:22:15,215 --> 03:22:19,536
It was easy. I just
dropped your name, Bill.

1762
03:22:19,636 --> 03:22:21,722

03:23:01,970 --> 03:23:07,042
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

1770
03:23:07,142 --> 03:23:09,549
And that private beach
just so happens

1771
03:23:09,550 --> 03:23:11,463
to look particularly beautiful

1772
03:23:11,563 --> 03:23:13,232
bathed in moonlight.

1773
03:23:14,566 --> 03:23:17,469
And there just so happens to
be a full moon out tonight.

1774
03:23:17,569 --> 03:23:20,574
So, sword fighter, if you want a

1775
03:23:20,575 --> 03:23:24,143
sword fight, that's
where I suggest.

1776
03:23:24,243 --> 03:23:28,397
But if you wanna be old
school about it...

1777
03:23:28,497 --> 03:23:32,151
and you know I'm all
about old school...

1778
03:23:32,251 --> 03:23:35,904
then we could wait until dawn and
slice each other up at sunrise

1779
03:23:36,004 --> 03:23:38,173
like a couple of
real-life honest...

1780
03:23:40,784 --> 03:23:41,793
Now,

1781
03:23:41,894 --> 03:23:43,490
if you don't settle down,

1782
03:23:43,591 --> 03:23:45,622
I'm gonna have to put
one in your kneecap.

1783
03:23:45,722 --> 03:23:49,176
And I hear tell that's a very
painful place to get shot in.

1784
03:23:53,361 --> 03:23:55,424
I'm just fucking with you.

1785
03:23:56,525 --> 03:23:57,985
Now...

1786
03:23:58,735 --> 03:24:01,305
when it comes to you...

1787
03:24:01,405 --> 03:24:03,073
and us...

1788
03:24:05,033 --> 03:24:08,187
I have a few unanswered questions.

1789
03:24:08,287 --> 03:24:13,834
So, before this tale of bloody
revenge reaches its climax,

1790
03:24:14,835 --> 03:24:17,291
I'm gonna ask you
some questions, and

1791
03:24:17,292 --> 03:24:19,423
I want you to tell me the truth.

1792
03:24:20,173 --> 03:24:23,176
However, there in lies a dilemma.

1793
03:24:24,428 --> 03:24:26,997
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

1794
03:24:27,097 --> 03:24:29,848
I believe you are
truly and utterly

1795
03:24:29,849 --> 03:24:32,294
incapable of telling the truth.

1796
03:24:32,394 --> 03:24:36,924
Especially to me. And least
of all, to yourself.

1797
03:24:37,024 --> 03:24:40,344
And when it comes to
the subject of me,

1798
03:24:40,444 --> 03:24:47,142
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

1799
03:24:47,242 --> 03:24:49,436
How do you suppose we
solve this dilemma?

1800
03:24:49,536 --> 03:24:51,063
Well,

1801
03:24:51,163 --> 03:24:53,357
it just so happens,

1802
03:24:53,457 --> 03:24:55,484
I have a solution.

1803
03:24:56,584 --> 03:24:58,028
Gotcha.

1804
03:24:58,128 --> 03:25:00,339
Goddamn.

1805
03:25:02,799 --> 03:25:06,203
What the fuck did you
just shoot me with?

1806
03:25:06,303 --> 03:25:10,057
My greatest invention. Or
at least my favourite.

1807
03:25:10,724 --> 03:25:11,740
Don't touch it,

1808
03:25:11,841 --> 03:25:14,387
or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

1809
03:25:18,398 --> 03:25:20,429
What lies within that dart,

1810
03:25:20,830 --> 03:25:24,638
just begging to course its
way through your veins...

1811
03:25:24,738 --> 03:25:29,184
is an incredibly potent and
quite infallible truth serum.

1812
03:25:29,284 --> 03:25:32,271
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

1813
03:25:32,371 --> 03:25:35,117
Twice as strong as
sodium pentothal,

1814
03:25:35,118 --> 03:25:37,417
with no druggie after effects.

1815
03:25:37,959 --> 03:25:43,824
Except for a slight wave
of euphoria. You feel it?

1816
03:25:43,924 --> 03:25:46,451
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

1817
03:25:46,551 --> 03:25:49,930
- No.
- Too bad.

1818
03:25:51,056 --> 03:25:53,208
As you know...

1819
03:25:53,308 --> 03:25:56,937
I'm quite keen on comic books.

1820
03:25:57,604 --> 03:26:00,507
Especially the ones
about superheroes.

1821
03:26:00,607 --> 03:26:02,888
I find the whole mythology

1822
03:26:02,889 --> 03:26:06,221
surrounding superheroes
fascinating.

1823
03:26:06,321 --> 03:26:09,950
Take my favourite
superhero, Superman.

1824
03:26:10,992 --> 03:26:14,079
Not a great comic book. Not
particularly well drawn.

1825
03:26:17,457 --> 03:26:19,818
But the mythology...

1826
03:26:19,918 --> 03:26:23,338
The mythology is not
only great, it's unique.

1827
03:26:24,005 --> 03:26:27,617
How long does this shit
take to go into effect?

1828
03:26:27,717 --> 03:26:28,821
About two minutes.

1829
03:26:28,922 --> 03:26:31,580
Just long enough for
me to finish my point.

1830
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:36,877
Now, a staple of the
superhero mythology

1831
03:26:36,977 --> 03:26:39,921
is there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

1832
03:26:40,021 --> 03:26:42,041
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,

1833
03:26:42,042 --> 03:26:44,517
Spider-Man is actually
Peter Parker.

1834
03:26:45,360 --> 03:26:49,306
When that character wakes up in
the morning, he's Peter Parker.

1835
03:26:49,406 --> 03:26:53,910
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

1836
03:26:54,578 --> 03:27:00,442
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

1837
03:27:00,542 --> 03:27:03,320
Superman didn't become Superman.

1838
03:27:03,420 --> 03:27:05,989
Superman was born Superman.

1839
03:27:06,089 --> 03:27:09,593
When Superman wakes up in
the morning, he's Superman.

1840
03:27:10,594 --> 03:27:13,180
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1841
03:27:14,055 --> 03:27:17,167
His outfit with the big red "S",

1842
03:27:17,267 --> 03:27:19,140
that's the blanket
he was wrapped in

1843
03:27:19,141 --> 03:27:20,962
as a baby when the
Kents found him.

1844
03:27:21,062 --> 03:27:23,482
Those are his clothes.

1845
03:27:24,024 --> 03:27:26,532
What Kent wears, the glasses, the

1846
03:27:26,533 --> 03:27:29,262
business suit, that's the costume.

1847
03:27:29,362 --> 03:27:33,867
That's the costume Superman
wears to blend in with us.

1848
03:27:35,535 --> 03:27:39,022
Clark Kent is how
Superman views us.

1849
03:27:39,122 --> 03:27:42,275
And what are the
characteristics of Clark Kent?

1850
03:27:42,375 --> 03:27:43,919
He's weak...

1851
03:27:44,878 --> 03:27:47,656
he's unsure of himself...

1852
03:27:47,756 --> 03:27:49,549
he's a coward.

1853
03:27:50,550 --> 03:27:55,639
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

1854
03:27:57,390 --> 03:28:02,062
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs Tommy Plimpton.

1855
03:28:03,104 --> 03:28:05,298
Ah, so.

1856
03:28:05,398 --> 03:28:07,734
The point emerges.

1857
03:28:09,402 --> 03:28:12,889
You would've worn the
costume of Arlene Plimpton.

1858
03:28:12,989 --> 03:28:15,867
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1859
03:28:16,868 --> 03:28:21,982
And every morning when you woke
up, you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1860
03:28:22,082 --> 03:28:24,084
Oh, you can... take
the needle out.

1861
03:28:31,341 --> 03:28:33,660
Are you calling me a superhero?

1862
03:28:33,760 --> 03:28:35,262
I'm calling you a killer.

1863
03:28:35,929 --> 03:28:38,832
A natural born killer.

1864
03:28:38,932 --> 03:28:42,586
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1865
03:28:42,686 --> 03:28:44,796
Moving to El Paso...

1866
03:28:44,896 --> 03:28:48,258
working in a used record store...

1867
03:28:48,358 --> 03:28:51,011
going to the movies with Tommy...

1868
03:28:51,111 --> 03:28:52,554
clipping coupons.

1869
03:28:52,654 --> 03:28:54,473
That's you...

1870
03:28:54,573 --> 03:28:57,976
trying to disguise
yourself as a worker bee.

1871
03:28:58,076 --> 03:29:01,104
That's you trying to
blend in with the hive.

1872
03:29:01,204 --> 03:29:03,331
But you're not a worker bee.

1873
03:29:04,583 --> 03:29:07,277
You're a renegade killer bee.

1874
03:29:07,377 --> 03:29:10,489
And no matter how much beer
you drank or barbecue you ate

1875
03:29:10,589 --> 03:29:13,617
or how fat your ass got,

1876
03:29:13,717 --> 03:29:17,637
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1877
03:29:20,015 --> 03:29:21,808
First question:

1878
03:29:24,185 --> 03:29:28,857
Did you really think your life
in El Paso was gonna work?

1879
03:29:35,280 --> 03:29:36,990
No.

1880
03:29:40,535 --> 03:29:43,563
But I would've had B.B.

1881
03:29:43,663 --> 03:29:46,233
Don't get me wrong.

1882
03:29:46,333 --> 03:29:50,237
I think you would have
been a wonderful mother.

1883
03:29:50,337 --> 03:29:52,422
But you are a killer.

1884
03:29:57,010 --> 03:29:59,663
All those people you
killed to get to me...

1885
03:29:59,763 --> 03:30:02,349
felt damn good, didn't they?

1886
03:30:04,434 --> 03:30:06,102
Yes.

1887
03:30:07,020 --> 03:30:09,439
Every single one of them?

1888
03:30:19,532 --> 03:30:21,368
Yes.

1889
03:30:24,704 --> 03:30:27,232
That was the warm up round.

1890
03:30:27,332 --> 03:30:32,003
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1891
03:30:39,344 --> 03:30:43,056
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

1892
03:30:46,893 --> 03:30:50,297
Do you remember the last
assignment you sent me on?

1893
03:30:50,397 --> 03:30:52,107
Of course.

1894
03:30:52,857 --> 03:30:54,901
Lisa Wong.

1895
03:30:56,152 --> 03:30:58,947
The morning I left, I was sick.

1896
03:31:00,490 --> 03:31:03,576
On the plane, I threw up.

1897
03:31:04,911 --> 03:31:07,414
So I started thinking:

1898
03:31:08,832 --> 03:31:11,026
Maybe I was pregnant.

1899
03:31:11,126 --> 03:31:13,579
Easy to use. Remove
cap and urinate

1900
03:31:13,580 --> 03:31:16,164
on the absorbent end
for five seconds.

1901
03:31:17,757 --> 03:31:20,243
Accurate results in
only 90 seconds.

1902
03:31:20,343 --> 03:31:22,149
You can read the
results as soon as

1903
03:31:22,150 --> 03:31:23,805
the line appears in the window.

1904
03:31:59,949 --> 03:32:01,034
Fuck.

1905
03:32:01,134 --> 03:32:03,328
What I didn't know...

1906
03:32:03,428 --> 03:32:07,540
was that somewhere on my
journey I had been spotted.

1907
03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:11,244
With me in L.A., it didn't
take Lisa Wong long

1908
03:32:11,445 --> 03:32:13,913
to send an assassin of her own.

1909
03:32:14,981 --> 03:32:16,466
Hello, can I help you?

1910
03:32:16,566 --> 03:32:20,011
Hello, I'm Karen Kim. I'm the
hospitality manager of the hotel.

1911
03:32:20,111 --> 03:32:22,097
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1912
03:32:22,197 --> 03:32:23,348
Oh, that's nice.

1913
03:32:25,124 --> 03:32:26,793
Can you just leave it by the door?

1914
03:32:39,205 --> 03:32:41,085
You pretty good with that shotgun?

1915
03:32:41,086 --> 03:32:43,067
Not that I have to
be at this range,

1916
03:32:43,167 --> 03:32:45,028
but I'm a fucking surgeon
with this shotgun.

1917
03:32:45,128 --> 03:32:48,156
Well, guess what, bitch? I'm
better than Annie Oakley.

1918
03:32:48,256 --> 03:32:49,776
And I got you right in my sight.

1919
03:32:49,877 --> 03:32:51,618
I could blow your
fucking head off.

1920
03:32:51,718 --> 03:32:54,146
Not before I put one
right between your eyes,

1921
03:32:54,447 --> 03:32:55,789
so let's talk.

1922
03:32:57,398 --> 03:32:59,192
Karen...

1923
03:33:01,402 --> 03:33:03,805
I just found out...

1924
03:33:03,905 --> 03:33:05,724
right now...

1925
03:33:05,824 --> 03:33:10,078
not a moment before you blew
a hole through the door...

1926
03:33:11,871 --> 03:33:16,109
- that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1927
03:33:16,209 --> 03:33:18,570
On the floor by the door...

1928
03:33:18,670 --> 03:33:22,323
is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1929
03:33:22,423 --> 03:33:23,591
Bullshit.

1930
03:33:24,717 --> 03:33:28,246
Any other time, you'd
be 100 percent right.

1931
03:33:28,346 --> 03:33:30,181
This time...

1932
03:33:31,766 --> 03:33:33,560
you're 100 percent wrong.

1933
03:33:35,603 --> 03:33:38,523
I'm the deadliest
woman in the world.

1934
03:33:39,524 --> 03:33:41,634
But right now...

1935
03:33:41,734 --> 03:33:44,404
I'm just scared
shitless for my baby.

1936
03:33:45,196 --> 03:33:46,865
Please.

1937
03:33:48,408 --> 03:33:50,785
Just look at the strip.

1938
03:33:52,787 --> 03:33:54,281
Please.

1939
03:33:55,874 --> 03:33:59,887
Stay where you are and don't move.

1940
03:34:17,770 --> 03:34:19,714
I don't know what this
fucking shit means.

1941
03:34:19,814 --> 03:34:21,774
The box with the directions,
it's right there.

1942
03:34:34,287 --> 03:34:36,064
Easy to use.

1943
03:34:36,164 --> 03:34:40,693
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end.

1944
03:34:40,793 --> 03:34:42,403
Blue means pregnant.

1945
03:34:42,503 --> 03:34:45,256
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1946
03:34:53,056 --> 03:34:54,749
Oh, ok.

1947
03:34:54,849 --> 03:34:56,709
Say I were to believe
you. What then?

1948
03:34:56,809 --> 03:34:58,853
Just go home.

1949
03:35:01,147 --> 03:35:03,316
I'll do the same.

1950
03:35:22,835 --> 03:35:24,504
Congratulations.

1951
03:35:28,091 --> 03:35:30,869
Before that strip turned blue...

1952
03:35:30,969 --> 03:35:33,429
I was a woman, I was your woman.

1953
03:35:34,430 --> 03:35:37,667
I was a killer who killed for you.

1954
03:35:37,767 --> 03:35:41,212
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

1955
03:35:41,312 --> 03:35:43,356
onto a speeding train.

1956
03:35:44,357 --> 03:35:46,109
For you.

1957
03:35:47,694 --> 03:35:51,097
But once that strip turned blue...

1958
03:35:51,197 --> 03:35:54,559
I could no longer do
any of those things.

1959
03:35:54,659 --> 03:35:57,103
Not any more.

1960
03:35:57,203 --> 03:35:59,580
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1961
03:36:02,792 --> 03:36:04,711
Can you understand that?

1962
03:36:07,797 --> 03:36:09,465
Yes.

1963
03:36:10,466 --> 03:36:12,660
But why didn't you...

1964
03:36:12,760 --> 03:36:15,054
tell me then, instead of now?

1965
03:36:16,055 --> 03:36:18,333
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1966
03:36:18,433 --> 03:36:20,393
And I didn't want that.

1967
03:36:21,144 --> 03:36:23,338
Not your decision to make.

1968
03:36:23,438 --> 03:36:25,465
Yes.

1969
03:36:25,565 --> 03:36:28,901
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1970
03:36:29,902 --> 03:36:33,614
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1971
03:36:34,615 --> 03:36:36,601
But with you...

1972
03:36:36,701 --> 03:36:40,580
she would've been born into
a world she shouldn't have.

1973
03:36:42,290 --> 03:36:44,500
I had to choose.

1974
03:36:45,710 --> 03:36:47,712
I chose her.

1975
03:36:50,173 --> 03:36:52,951
You know, five years ago,

1976
03:36:53,051 --> 03:36:55,668
if I had to make a
list of impossible

1977
03:36:55,669 --> 03:36:57,872
things that could never happen,

1978
03:36:57,972 --> 03:37:03,102
you performing a coup de grâce on
me by busting a cap in my crown...

1979
03:37:06,105 --> 03:37:08,733
would've been right at
the top of the list.

1980
03:37:10,401 --> 03:37:12,487
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

1981
03:37:13,738 --> 03:37:15,556
I'm sorry.

1982
03:37:15,656 --> 03:37:17,742
Was that a question?

1983
03:37:19,077 --> 03:37:21,562
Of impossible things
that could never happen,

1984
03:37:21,662 --> 03:37:25,124
yes, in this instance you
would've been wrong.

1985
03:37:25,625 --> 03:37:27,026
Well?

1986
03:37:27,126 --> 03:37:30,655
When you never came back,

1987
03:37:30,755 --> 03:37:36,828
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong, or
somebody else, had killed you.

1988
03:37:36,928 --> 03:37:40,206
Oh. And for the record...

1989
03:37:40,306 --> 03:37:44,460
letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1990
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:46,437
is quite cruel.

1991
03:37:49,982 --> 03:37:53,903
I mourned you for three months.

1992
03:37:54,695 --> 03:37:57,990
And in the third month
of mourning you...

1993
03:37:59,117 --> 03:38:01,394
I tracked you down.

1994
03:38:01,494 --> 03:38:03,688
I wasn't trying to track you down.

1995
03:38:03,788 --> 03:38:06,205
I was trying to track
down the fucking

1996
03:38:06,206 --> 03:38:08,126
assholes I thought killed you.

1997
03:38:09,252 --> 03:38:11,129
So I find you...

1998
03:38:12,797 --> 03:38:15,033
and what do I find?

1999
03:38:15,133 --> 03:38:18,369
Not only are you not dead...

2000
03:38:18,469 --> 03:38:22,682
you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

2001
03:38:24,767 --> 03:38:27,228
And you're pregnant.

2002
03:38:30,606 --> 03:38:33,151
I overreacted.

2003
03:38:41,742 --> 03:38:45,563
You overreacted? Is
that your explanation?

2004
03:38:45,663 --> 03:38:48,149
I didn't say I was
gonna explain myself.

2005
03:38:48,249 --> 03:38:50,526
I said I was gonna
tell you the truth.

2006
03:38:50,626 --> 03:38:55,423
But if that's too cryptic,
let's get literal.

2007
03:38:57,425 --> 03:38:59,093
I'm a killer.

2008
03:39:00,094 --> 03:39:02,597
I'm a murdering
bastard. You know that.

2009
03:39:03,514 --> 03:39:06,417
And there are consequences...

2010
03:39:06,517 --> 03:39:09,896
to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

2011
03:39:10,897 --> 03:39:13,399
You experienced some of them.

2012
03:39:16,986 --> 03:39:20,640
Was my reaction really
that surprising?

2013
03:39:20,740 --> 03:39:24,785
Yes. It was.

2014
03:39:26,746 --> 03:39:30,483
Could you do what you did?

2015
03:39:30,583 --> 03:39:32,627
Of course you could.

2016
03:39:34,420 --> 03:39:40,910
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

2017
03:39:41,010 --> 03:39:43,913
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

2018
03:39:44,013 --> 03:39:46,265
but you thought wrong.

2019
03:39:52,438 --> 03:39:56,651
You and I have
unfinished business.

2020
03:39:57,443 --> 03:40:00,821
Baby... you ain't kidding.

2021
03:40:33,813 --> 03:40:37,066
Pai Mei taught you
the Five-Point-Palm

2022
03:40:37,067 --> 03:40:39,318
Exploding-Heart Technique?

2023
03:40:42,321 --> 03:40:44,657
Course he did.

2024
03:40:46,409 --> 03:40:48,536
Why didn't you tell me?

2025
03:40:52,290 --> 03:40:54,500
I don't know.

2026
03:40:56,752 --> 03:40:58,587
Because I'm...

2027
03:40:59,672 --> 03:41:01,841
a bad person.

2028
03:41:02,883 --> 03:41:04,552
No.

2029
03:41:06,512 --> 03:41:09,582
You're not a bad person.

2030
03:41:09,682 --> 03:41:12,585
You're a terrific person.

2031
03:41:12,685 --> 03:41:16,022
You're my favourite person.

2032
03:41:17,189 --> 03:41:20,151
But every once in a while...

2033
03:41:21,152 --> 03:41:23,112
you can be a real cunt.

2034
03:41:42,715 --> 03:41:44,675
How do I look?

2035
03:42:00,232 --> 03:42:02,818
You look ready.

2036
03:43:49,467 --> 03:43:53,679
Well, well, well. If it
ain't the little flower.

2037
03:43:59,717 --> 03:44:01,962
Good evening, Mr And Mrs America
and all the ships at sea.

2038
03:44:02,062 --> 03:44:04,090
Let's go to press. Flash.

2039
03:44:04,190 --> 03:44:06,884
Do you have a magpie in your home?

2040
03:44:06,984 --> 03:44:09,303
If you do, you are most fortunate.

2041
03:44:09,403 --> 03:44:12,973
The magpie is the most charming
bird in all the world.

2042
03:44:13,073 --> 03:44:15,601
He is the best friend
a farmer ever had.

2043
03:44:15,701 --> 03:44:18,729
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

2044
03:44:18,829 --> 03:44:23,334
And always remember, the
magpie deserves your respect.

2045
03:44:59,245 --> 03:45:00,621
Thank you.

2046
03:45:01,872 --> 03:45:04,708
Thank you. Thank you.

2047
03:45:06,126 --> 03:45:08,128
Oh, thank you.

2048
03:45:10,339 --> 03:45:12,366
Now, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

2049
03:45:12,466 --> 03:45:14,994
I ain't got no headache.

2050
03:45:15,094 --> 03:45:18,097
