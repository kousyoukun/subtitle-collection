00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:26,921
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:41,318
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:46,823
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:52,283
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:55,748
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,914
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:05,333
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:28,322
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:32,399
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:37,079
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:40,365
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:43,245
There you go.

13
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:53,219
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,673
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:02,885
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:08,059
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,027
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:14,531
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,746
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:37,262
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:50,602
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,767
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:14,338
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,462
Now!

25
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:35,518
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:51,995
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,002
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:02,171
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,303
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:10,507
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,847
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,524
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,939
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:28,023
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

35
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,734
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:35,331
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:42,916
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:48,045
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:51,761
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:55,010
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,512
Get in.

42
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:07,101
Make it move.

43
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:11,490
Move!

44
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:14,198
- Move!
- He's asleep!

45
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:16,950
He's boring.

46
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,834
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:24,743
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:29,123
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:34,556
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:41,103
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:42,973
Do you?

52
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,317
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:51,729
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:54,236
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:01,827
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,034
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,143
Thanks.

58
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,772
Anytime.

59
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:39,024
Snake!

60
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:57,840
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:01,213
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:06,798
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:16,980
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:21,655
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:25,732
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:32,952
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,413
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:15,825
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

69
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,793
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:54,617
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:09,633
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,181
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:42,908
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:48,203
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:52,834
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,801
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:01,135
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:06,683
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:18,979
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

80
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:32,708
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,415
Stop it!

82
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:43,508
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:51,264
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,643
Get off!

85
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:03,568
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:07,410
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,745
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,208
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,408
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,551
Who's there?

91
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,141
Sorry about that.

92
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:36,611
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,334
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:51,047
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,803
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,850
I'm not Harry.

97
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:04,386
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

98
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,767
Got something for you.

99
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:12,569
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:18,490
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,072
Thank you.

102
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:29,462
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:48,772
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:53,892
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:57,854
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

106
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:03,359
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,996
Learned what?

108
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,743
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,998
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

110
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,247
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,376
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:20,593
...I can't be a wizard.

113
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:26,007
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,098
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:35,975
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,494
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,961
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry. "

118
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:04,130
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:08,555
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:11,849
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,761
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:21,934
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:26,316
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

124
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:30,197
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,154
A freak!

126
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,324
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,245
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:46,457
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:50,674
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,224
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:59,348
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:02,018
He'll not be going.

133
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:05,565
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:06,767
Muggle?

135
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:11,109
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:15,192
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:21,330
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:26,334
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:31,089
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,341
...in front of me.

141
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:56,480
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,823
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

143
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,123
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,501
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:32,100
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,234
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:41,234
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad. "

148
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,066
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,660
If you know where to go.

150
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:12,390
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:16,472
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:19,777
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

153
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:23,564
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,321
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,869
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:41,579
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,337
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:49,546
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:52,173
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:55,519
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,356
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:05,440
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:07,399
Goodbye.

164
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,701
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

165
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,365
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,367
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:42,144
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:00,988
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,164
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,268
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:36,355
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:39,902
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:48,201
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,789
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:57,511
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:14,146
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:19,603
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:22:19,824 --> 00:22:21,781
Best stay close.

179
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,494
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:36,879
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:41,044
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:46,724
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,803
And there's something else as well.

184
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:54,396
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:03,521
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:06,782
Very well.

187
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:14,833
Vault 687.

188
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:19,041
Lamp, please.

189
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:28,883
Key, please.

190
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:56,076
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:01,075
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:05,458
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:07,258
Stand back.

194
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:38,323
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:50,668
I still need a wand.

196
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:54,299
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:24:55,012 --> 00:25:00,137
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

198
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:19,945
Hello?

199
00:25:22,913 --> 00:25:24,740
Hello?

200
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:32,546
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:42,553
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:48,644
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,608
Here we are.

204
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:08,742
Give it a wave.

205
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,751
Apparently not.

206
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:27,388
Perhaps...

207
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,217
...this.

208
00:26:38,276 --> 00:26:42,903
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:51,746
I wonder...

210
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:23,230
Curious.

211
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:26,362
Very curious.

212
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:29,692
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,696
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:37,665
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:42,584
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:46,088
Just one other.

217
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,629
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:56,557
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:01,597
And who owned that wand?

220
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,847
We do not speak his name.

221
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,817
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:12,030
It's not always clear why.

223
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:15,906
But I think it is clear...

224
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,034
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:24,494
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:27,422
...did great things.

227
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,623
Terrible...

228
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,341
...yes, but great.

229
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:41,014
Harry! Harry!

230
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:43,765
Happy birthday.

231
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:54,401
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:28:54,781 --> 00:29:00,367
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:29:00,578 --> 00:29:04,196
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:12,628
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,377
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:18,083
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:23,297
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

238
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:27,135
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:29,227
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:33,686
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

241
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:39,897
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,320
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

243
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:48,912
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

244
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,411
<i>Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.</i>

245
00:29:54,546 --> 00:29:57,582
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

246
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:01,583
<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

247
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:08,546
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

248
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,140
<i>Except you.</i>

249
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:17,274
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:21,898
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:27,950
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:31,779
What happened to V?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:36,284
Well, some say he died.

254
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,909
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,380
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,545
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:51,181
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,679
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,811
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:11,862
What are you looking at?

261
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,613
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:19,828
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

263
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:24,918
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:30,469
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:35,589
"Platform 93/4"?

266
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:40,600
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.

267
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:44,146
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,245
Sorry.

269
00:32:05,752 --> 00:32:08,505
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:10,256
On your left.

271
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:14,292
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?

272
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:17,049
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:20,597
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,428
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.

275
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,275
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,444
Fred, you next.

277
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:48,365
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

278
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:50,542
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:32:54,674 --> 00:32:57,081
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,463
Excuse me.

281
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,347
Could you tell me how to?

282
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:13,098
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:15,772
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:21,905
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:25,568
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

286
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:27,422
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,843
Not at all.

288
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:35,341
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:34:35,603 --> 00:34:38,224
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:41,646
So it's true!

291
00:34:41,858 --> 00:34:44,645
I mean, do you really have the?

292
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:48,107
- The what?
- The scar?

293
00:34:51,285 --> 00:34:53,491
Wicked!

294
00:34:55,955 --> 00:35:01,115
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:07,461
We'll take the lot.

296
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:22,977
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

297
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:26,767
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:30,816
...spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,193
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:45,210
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:50,875
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,672
Watch it!

303
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:00,463
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:07,266
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

305
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,566
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:14,227
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:17,982
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,362
A little.

309
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:22,910
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:25,160
Yeah.

311
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:33,546
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:36,592
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

313
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:41,505
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:36:42,557 --> 00:36:46,886
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

315
00:36:47,144 --> 00:36:50,228
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

316
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:58,605
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:02,072
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,904
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:10,579
For example:

320
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,745
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

321
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,459
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:23,547
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:27,344
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are?

324
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:31,261
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

325
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:36,554
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:44,146
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:46,322
Just there.

328
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,454
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:38:02,674 --> 00:38:07,880
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:17,847
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:23,268
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:39:08,986 --> 00:39:10,778
Wicked.

333
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,173
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:45,389
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:39:45,604 --> 00:39:50,645
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:53,978
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:58,656
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:04,117
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:08,246
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:12,587
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:18,087
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:19,624
Trevor!

343
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:30,186
Sorry.

344
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:34,346
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:39,027
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:42,068
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:40:42,283 --> 00:40:43,693
Harry Potter?

348
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:46,996
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:49,493
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:40:49,832 --> 00:40:52,157
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:57,710
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:03,712
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:08,681
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:12,675
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:15,053
I can help you there.

356
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:21,106
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:28,948
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:52,049
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:55,261
<i>I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.</i>

360
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:11,366
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:15,572
Now, before we begin...

362
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:19,037
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,041
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,544
The first years, please note...

365
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:32,043
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:38,600
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:43,436
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,943
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,276
Thank you.

370
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:57,111
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:42:57,326 --> 00:43:00,945
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:04,367
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:07,205
Hermione Granger.

374
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:12,084
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:15,835
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:25,176
Right, then. Right.

377
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:28,978
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,569
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,328
Slytherin!

380
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,209
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,958
Susan Bones.

382
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,637
Harry, what is it?

383
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:07,595
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:09,262
Let's see...

385
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:13,850
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:18,016
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:36,869
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:39,877
Gryffindor!

389
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:48,588
Harry Potter.

390
00:45:06,658 --> 00:45:09,658
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:13,818
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,328
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:20,374
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,746
But where to put you?

395
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,830
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:29,711
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,805
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:40,356
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:45,316
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:47,271
Better be...

401
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:49,445
...Gryffindor!

402
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,759
Your attention, please.

403
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,515
Let the feast begin.

404
00:46:39,454 --> 00:46:40,996
I'm half and half.

405
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:44,455
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:48,166
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,955
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,419
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:46:56,636 --> 00:46:58,546
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

410
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:04,350
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

411
00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:11,181
Hello! How are you?

412
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:14,811
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:47:24,913 --> 00:47:27,404
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:34,832
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:40,468
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:46,431
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:47:46,642 --> 00:47:49,394
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:53,103
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,397
Like this.

420
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,242
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:13,784
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:17,376
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:48:17,588 --> 00:48:21,751
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:36,680
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:39,567
That picture's moving.

426
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:43,275
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

427
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:47,356
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

428
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:50,112
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:07,711
Password?

430
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,965
Caput Draconis.

431
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:22,604
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,726
Gather around here.

433
00:49:29,448 --> 00:49:32,732
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:37,363
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,700
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:50:48,898 --> 00:50:50,522
Made it!

437
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:55,145
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:50:58,407 --> 00:51:03,364
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:07,872
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:51:08,082 --> 00:51:11,286
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

441
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:17,256
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:31,102
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:51:31,313 --> 00:51:34,931
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,892
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:42,196
However, for those select few...

446
00:51:43,115 --> 00:51:46,449
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:51:50,122 --> 00:51:53,408
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:51:53,626 --> 00:51:56,543
...and ensnare the senses.

449
00:51:56,753 --> 00:51:59,292
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:05,425
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:14,349
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

452
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:20,516
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:52:20,734 --> 00:52:23,688
...to not pay attention.

454
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:32,233
Mr. Potter.

455
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:37,287
Our new celebrity.

456
00:52:39,461 --> 00:52:45,249
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,918
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:55,764
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:52:57,061 --> 00:52:58,436
I don't know, sir.

460
00:52:58,729 --> 00:53:02,560
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,351
I don't know, sir.

462
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:09,726
Pity.

463
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:15,660
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:53:16,412 --> 00:53:19,199
...is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:26,998
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum</i>

466
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:29,756
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

467
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:32,760
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:37,720
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

469
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:46,347
Mail's here.

470
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:21,591
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:27,725
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:33,442
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:54:33,818 --> 00:54:37,152
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:54:37,447 --> 00:54:40,862
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:54:41,075 --> 00:54:44,740
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:50,701
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:56,623
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day. "

478
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:01,087
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,767
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,768
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:20,524
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:55:20,738 --> 00:55:24,652
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:30,454
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up. "

484
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:32,620
Up!

485
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:33,823
Up.

486
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,162
Up.

487
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:40,463
Up. Up!

488
00:55:40,673 --> 00:55:42,665
With feeling.

489
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,473
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:58,354
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:02,563
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:07,902
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:11,948
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:16,455
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,827
On my whistle. Three, two...

496
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,629
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,130
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

498
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,591
Neville!

499
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,979
Come back down this instant!

500
00:57:07,964 --> 00:57:10,336
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:57:15,889 --> 00:57:18,047
Is he all right?

502
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:24,103
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:57:25,397 --> 00:57:30,059
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:57:30,276 --> 00:57:33,941
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:39,398
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:41,529
Did you see his face?

507
00:57:41,746 --> 00:57:45,578
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,283
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:52,828
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:59,465
How about on the roof?

511
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:04,470
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:58:06,978 --> 00:58:10,810
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:58:11,024 --> 00:58:13,942
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:58:14,235 --> 00:58:16,144
What an idiot.

515
00:58:19,491 --> 00:58:23,025
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:58:23,244 --> 00:58:25,367
Is that so?

517
00:58:28,498 --> 00:58:30,787
Have it your way, then.

518
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:07,150
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:09,408
Harry Potter!

520
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:12,364
Follow me.

521
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:26,293
You wait here.

522
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:33,346
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,387
Yes, of course.

524
00:59:41,068 --> 00:59:46,821
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:52,407
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:59:52,662 --> 00:59:54,868
I always knew he'd do well.

527
00:59:55,331 --> 00:59:59,375
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:04,081
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

529
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:06,919
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
01:00:07,134 --> 01:00:09,624
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:13,544
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
01:00:13,764 --> 01:00:16,434
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
01:00:16,643 --> 01:00:20,592
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
01:00:20,813 --> 01:00:23,565
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
01:00:23,816 --> 01:00:29,439
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:32,857
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
01:00:33,283 --> 01:00:38,075
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
01:00:46,629 --> 01:00:50,461
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,506
I didn't know.

540
01:00:58,015 --> 01:01:02,594
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:05,099
Who doesn't?

542
01:01:06,023 --> 01:01:08,146
What's happening?

543
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:12,569
The staircases change, remember?

544
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:22,494
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

545
01:01:30,128 --> 01:01:33,544
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:35,922
We're not supposed to be here.

547
01:01:36,134 --> 01:01:40,049
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
01:01:41,223 --> 01:01:42,800
Let's go.

549
01:01:45,018 --> 01:01:47,888
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

550
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:55,024
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:02,197
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

552
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:04,568
Move over!

553
01:02:05,537 --> 01:02:07,660
<i>Alohomora.</i>

554
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,449
Get in.

555
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:12,789
<i>Alohomora?</i>

556
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:15,540
<i>Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.</i>

557
01:02:15,755 --> 01:02:19,124
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:26,385
Come on.

559
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:29,722
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

560
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:33,595
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

561
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:04,752
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:08,633
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:13,011
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:03:13,226 --> 01:03:16,096
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:19,977
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:23,725
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

567
01:03:24,153 --> 01:03:27,901
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:03:28,115 --> 01:03:31,733
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:35,072
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:42,580
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:03:47,216 --> 01:03:51,427
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:03:51,638 --> 01:03:57,343
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:06,567
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

574
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:12,731
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:17,327
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:21,997
I think so. What are those?

577
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,451
You better take this.

578
01:04:36,513 --> 01:04:39,300
Careful now, it's coming back.

579
01:04:45,897 --> 01:04:49,515
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:08,454
What was that?

581
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:12,959
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:05:13,172 --> 01:05:16,672
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:24,841
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,591
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:05:27,812 --> 01:05:30,812
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

586
01:05:31,023 --> 01:05:35,021
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:37,192
What do I do with it?

588
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:40,654
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:05:40,908 --> 01:05:43,362
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:47,526
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:05:56,589 --> 01:06:01,927
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:06:02,136 --> 01:06:06,085
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:06:06,306 --> 01:06:08,713
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:06:08,976 --> 01:06:14,100
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:06:14,314 --> 01:06:17,647
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:06:18,193 --> 01:06:23,815
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:28,825
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.</i>

598
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:32,361
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

599
01:06:32,623 --> 01:06:34,948
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

600
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:43,042
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:49,254
<i>Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.</i>

602
01:06:49,847 --> 01:06:54,058
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,395
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

604
01:07:05,904 --> 01:07:11,528
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,403
Splendid!

606
01:07:14,996 --> 01:07:17,202
Well done, dear.

607
01:07:21,418 --> 01:07:25,499
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:07:32,012 --> 01:07:36,259
<i>"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. "</i>

609
01:07:36,516 --> 01:07:41,855
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:07:42,522 --> 01:07:45,060
I think she heard you.

611
01:08:13,718 --> 01:08:15,795
Where's Hermione?

612
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:19,131
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:23,429
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:31,521
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:35,110
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:37,908 --> 01:08:40,233
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:49,960
Silence!

618
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:55,590
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:57,836
Now...

620
01:08:58,052 --> 01:09:02,594
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:08,099
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,322
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,277
How could a troll get in?

624
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:29,654
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,872
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:49,222
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:09:53,104 --> 01:09:55,262
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:28,674
Hermione, move!

629
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:36,185
Help! Help!

630
01:10:38,188 --> 01:10:40,264
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:10:52,702 --> 01:10:54,575
Help!

632
01:11:15,723 --> 01:11:18,096
Do something!

633
01:11:19,519 --> 01:11:23,469
- What?
- Anything!

634
01:11:24,106 --> 01:11:26,514
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

635
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:29,059
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

636
01:11:39,997 --> 01:11:41,989
Cool.

637
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:09,231
Is it dead?

638
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:13,355
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:12:19,617 --> 01:12:21,942
Troll boogers.

640
01:12:24,455 --> 01:12:27,990
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:32,835
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:12:35,007 --> 01:12:36,205
Miss Granger?

643
01:12:37,092 --> 01:12:42,169
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:12:42,389 --> 01:12:44,263
But I was wrong.

645
01:12:44,474 --> 01:12:49,515
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:54,934
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:12:55,151 --> 01:13:00,821
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:13:01,032 --> 01:13:04,033
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:07,825
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:13:08,288 --> 01:13:10,281
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:13,915
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:17,543
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:13:17,755 --> 01:13:20,377
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:13:20,634 --> 01:13:23,041
Five points...

655
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:27,548
...will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:13:29,141 --> 01:13:32,226
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:13:37,816 --> 01:13:41,564
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:13:49,438 --> 01:13:52,190
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,602
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,026
I'm not hungry.

661
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:04,237
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:07,620
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:10,951
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:14:18,633 --> 01:14:22,049
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

665
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:26,598
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:14:26,807 --> 01:14:29,477
...so he could get past that dog.

667
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:32,437
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

668
01:14:32,688 --> 01:14:34,894
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:14:35,565 --> 01:14:38,816
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:14:39,027 --> 01:14:42,277
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

671
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:43,603
You're saying...

672
01:14:43,824 --> 01:14:48,319
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:15:01,466 --> 01:15:05,414
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

674
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:07,512
Let's open it.

675
01:15:17,688 --> 01:15:18,934
It's a broomstick.

676
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:23,860
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:27,360
But who?

678
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:51,501
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

679
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:55,386
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:15:55,599 --> 01:15:59,099
What happened?

681
01:16:00,099 --> 01:16:10,099
