6
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,140
I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.

7
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,540
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

8
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Are the rumors true, Albus?

9
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,500
I'm afraid so, professor. The good and the bad.

10
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,980
- And the boy? - Hagrid is bringing him.

11
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,140
Is it wise to trust Hagrid with something so important?

12
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,540
Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.

13
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,540
Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall.

14
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,620
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid? - No, sir.

15
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,300
Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol.

16
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,580
Try not to wake him.

17
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,460
There you go.

18
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,420
Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?

19
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,900
I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles.

20
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,100
- They really are  - The only family he has.

21
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,300
He'll be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.

22
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,260
Exactly.

23
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,740
He's far better off growing up away from all of that.

24
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,980
Until he's ready.

25
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,460
There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.

26
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,820
Good luck

27
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,980
Harry Potter.

28
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,540
Up. Get up!

29
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,700
Now!

30
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,740
Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!

31
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,220
- Here he comes, the birthday boy. - Happy birthday, son.

32
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,220
Why don't you just cook the breakfast and try not to burn anything.

33
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,380
- Yes, Aunt Petunia. - I want everything to be perfect

34
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,540
for my Dudley's special day!

35
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,740
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy. - Yes, Uncle Vernon.

36
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,060
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

37
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,740
- How many are there? - 36. Counted them myself.

38
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,180
36?! But last year I had 37!

39
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,260
- But some are bigger than last year's. - I don't care!

40
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,980
This is what we're going to do.

41
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,540
We're going to buy you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

42
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,480
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.

43
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,140
I'm really looking forward to it.

44
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,260
I'm warning you now, boy.

45
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,980
Any funny business, any at all...

46
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,260
and you won't have any meals for a week.

47
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,740
Get in.

48
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,340
Make it move.

49
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,700
Move!

50
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,420
- Move! - He's asleep!

51
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,180
He's boring.

52
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,060
Sorry about him.

53
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,980
He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day

54
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,340
watching people press their ugly faces in on you.

55
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,780
Can you hear me?

56
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,340
It's just, I've never talked to a snake before.

57
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,220
Do you?

58
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,540
Do you talk to people often?

59
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,980
You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there?

60
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,460
Do you miss your family?

61
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,060
I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either.

62
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe what this snake is doing!

63
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Thanks.

64
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,020
Anytime.

65
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,260
Snake!

66
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,060
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

67
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,460
My darling boy! How did you get in there?

68
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,020
Who did this? How did you get in there? Is there a snake?

69
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,050
It's all right, sweetheart.

70
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,220
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

71
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,900
- What happened? - I swear, I don't know!

72
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,980
The glass was there and then it was gone, like magic.

73
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,180
There's no such thing as magic.

74
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,330
And smile!

75
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,730
Vernon, look at him! I can't believe it!

76
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,410
In a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

77
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,410
Caveat Smeltonia. Proudest moment of my life.

78
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,730
Will I have to wear that too?

79
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,090
What? Go to Smeltings?

80
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,090
Don't be stupid! You're going to the state school.

81
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,850
This is what you'll wear when I finish dyeing it.

82
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,410
That's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit like old elephant skin.

83
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,850
Fit you well enough.

84
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,810
Go get the post. Go!

85
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,410
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

86
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,810
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter! - It's mine!

87
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,770
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

88
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,610
No more mail through this letterbox.

89
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,110
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

90
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,670
Shoo! Go on.

91
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,390
Fine day, Sunday.

92
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,710
In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?

93
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,350
- Because there's no post on Sundays? - Right you are, Harry!

94
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,310
No post on Sunday.

95
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,630
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

96
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,190
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

97
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,470
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

98
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,190
Make it stop, please!

99
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,910
Stop it!

100
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,990
Mummy, what's happening?

101
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,750
Give me that! Give me that letter!

102
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,150
Get off!

103
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,070
They're my letters! Let go of me!

104
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,910
That's it! We're going away!

105
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,230
Far away, where they can't find us!

106
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,710
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

107
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,910
Make a wish, Harry.

108
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,070
Who's there?

109
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,670
Sorry about that.

110
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,110
I demand that you leave at once. You are breaking and entering.

111
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,830
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

112
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,550
I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry.

113
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,470
You're a bit more along than I expected.

114
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,310
Particularly in the middle.

115
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,350
I'm not Harry.

116
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,910
- I am. - Well, of course you are.

117
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,270
Got something for you.

118
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:36,070
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.

119
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,990
Baked it myself, words and all.

120
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,590
Thank you.

121
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,950
It's not every day your young man turns 11, is it?

122
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,270
Excuse me, but who are you?

123
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,390
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.

124
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,350
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts. - Sorry, no.

125
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,870
Didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?

126
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,510
Learned what?

127
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,270
You're a wizard, Harry.

128
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,510
- I'm a what? - A wizard.

129
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,750
A good one, I'd wager, once you're trained up.

130
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,870
No, you've made a mistake. I mean

131
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,110
I can't be a wizard.

132
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,510
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

133
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,590
Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen?

134
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,470
Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared?

135
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,990
"Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to accept you

136
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,470
at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. "

137
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,250
He will not be going I tell you!

138
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,630
We swore when we took him that we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

139
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,070
You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?

140
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,350
Of course we knew. How could you not be?

141
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,270
My perfect sister being who she was.

142
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,470
My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter.

143
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,830
"We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?"

144
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,710
I was the only one to see her for what she was.

145
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,670
A freak!

146
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,830
Then she met that Potter, and then she had you

147
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,970
and I knew you would be the same.

148
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,750
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

149
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,990
And then she went and got herself blown up, and we got landed with you.

150
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,190
Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash.

151
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,750
A car crash? A car crash killed Lily and James Potter?

152
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,870
- We had to say something. - It's an outrage! A scandal!

153
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,550
He'll not be going.

154
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,070
And I suppose a great Muggle like you is going to stop him, are you?

155
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,270
Muggle?

156
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,630
Non-magic folk. This boy's had his name down since he were born.

157
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,710
He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry.

158
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,970
He'll be under the finest

159
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,830
headmaster Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

160
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,870
I will not pay to have a crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks.

161
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,590
Never insult Albus Dumbledore

162
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,870
in front of me.

163
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,660
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that.

164
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,350
- I'm not allowed to do magic. - Okay.

165
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,630
We're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.

166
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,030
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

167
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,940
First years will require three sets of work robes

168
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,980
one wand. "

169
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,220
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

170
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,870
One pair of dragon hide gloves.

171
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,340
Hagrid, do they mean from a real dragon?

172
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,740
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

173
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,980
- Crikey. I'd love a dragon. - You'd like a dragon?

174
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:21,020
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood.

175
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,380
All students must be equipped with

176
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,500
one standard size 2 pewter cauldron

177
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,600
and may bring, if they desire,

178
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,500
either an owl, a cat or a toad.

179
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,340
Can we find all this in London?

180
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,940
If you know where to go.

181
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,660
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

182
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,740
No, thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business.

183
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,060
Just helping Harry buy his school supplies.

184
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,860
Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!

185
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,580
Welcome back, Mr. Potter. Welcome back.

186
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,140
Doris Crockford. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.

187
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,860
Harry Potter. Can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.

188
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,620
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

189
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,620
Harry, this is Professor Quirrell.

190
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,720
He will be teaching your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

191
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,460
Oh, nice to meet you.

192
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,780
Fearfully fascinating subject.

193
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,620
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

194
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,700
Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy.

195
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,660
Goodbye.

196
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,980
- See, Harry? You're famous. - But why am I famous?

197
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,660
All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?

198
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,660
I'm not sure I'm the right person to tell you that.

199
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,420
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

200
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,260
Here, you get your quills and ink.

201
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,460
Over there, all your bits and bobs for doing wizardry.

202
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,540
It's a world-class racing broom.

203
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,660
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

204
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,180
It's the fastest model yet.

205
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,500
But Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.

206
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,060
There's your money. Gringotts, the wizard bank.

207
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,780
Ain't no safer place, not one. Except perhaps Hogwarts.

208
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,420
Hagrid, what exactly are these things?

209
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,300
They're goblins, Harry.

210
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,900
Clever as they come, goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts.

211
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,060
Best stay close.

212
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,780
Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.

213
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,180
And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?

214
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,340
Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere.

215
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,020
Ha! There's the little devil.

216
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,100
And there's something else as well.

217
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,660
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

218
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,820
It's about You-Know-What in vault you-know-which.

219
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,060
Very well.

220
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,100
Vault 687.

221
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,340
Lamp, please.

222
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,180
Key, please.

223
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,380
Did you think your parents would leave you with nothing, did you?

224
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,380
- Vault 713. - What's in there, Hagrid?

225
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,740
Can't tell you. Hogwarts business. Very secret.

226
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,540
Stand back.

227
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,620
Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.

228
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,980
I still need a wand.

229
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,580
A wand? You want Ollivanders. There ain't no place better.

230
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,060
Why don't you run along there and wait.

231
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,420
I just got one more thing I got to do. It won't be long.

232
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,220
Hello?

233
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,020
Hello?

234
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,820
I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

235
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,860
It seems only yesterday

236
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,080
...that your mother and father

237
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,940
were in here buying their first wands.

238
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,900
Here we are.

239
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,020
Give it a wave.

240
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,060
Apparently not.

241
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,700
Perhaps...

242
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,500
...this.

243
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,180
No, no, definitely not. No matter.

244
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,060
I wonder...

245
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,540
Curious.

246
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,660
Very curious.

247
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,980
Sorry, but what's curious?

248
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,020
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

249
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,980
It so happens that the phoenix...

250
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,900
...whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather.

251
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,380
Just one other.

252
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,940
It is curious that you should be destined for this wand...

253
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,860
...when its brother gave you that scar.

254
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,900
And who owned that wand?

255
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,140
We do not speak his name.

256
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,100
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

257
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,340
It's not always clear why.

258
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,220
But I think it is clear...

259
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,340
...that we can expect great things from you.

260
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,780
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

261
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,700
...did great things.

262
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,940
Terrible...

263
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,660
...yes, but great.

264
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,300
Harry! Harry!

265
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,060
Happy birthday.

266
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,700
You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.

267
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,240
He killed my parents, didn't he?

268
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,660
The one who gave me this.

269
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,500
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

270
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,940
First, and understand this because it's very important:

271
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,700
Not all wizards are good.

272
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,380
Some of them go bad. A few years ago...

273
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,170
...there was a wizard who went as bad as you can go.

274
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,620
And his name was V...

275
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,460
- His name was V... - Maybe if you wrote it down?

276
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,540
No, I can't spell it.

277
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,980
- All right, Voldemort. - Voldemort?

278
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,220
It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

279
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,620
Voldemort started to gather some followers.

280
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,220
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

281
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,740
Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.

282
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,900
Your parents fought against him.

283
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,900
But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.

284
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,860
Nobody, not one.

285
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,460
Except you.

286
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,580
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

287
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,220
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry.

288
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,660
A mark like that only comes

289
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,260
from being touched by a curse, an evil curse.

290
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,100
What happened to V...? To You-Know-Who?

291
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,580
Well, some say he died.

292
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,220
Codswallop, in my opinion.

293
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,700
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

294
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,860
...too tired to carry on.

295
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,010
But one thing's certain.

296
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,500
Something about you stumped him that night.

297
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,980
That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name.

298
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,140
You're the boy who lived.

299
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,180
What are you looking at?

300
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
Blimey, is that the time?

301
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,860
Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.

302
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,140
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

303
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,820
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.

304
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,220
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

305
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,780
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket, that's very important.

306
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,900
"Platform 9 3/4"?

307
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,770
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.

308
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,900
This says platform 9 3/4.

309
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,460
There's no such thing, is there?

310
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,580
Sorry.

311
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

312
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,580
On your left.

313
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,620
Can you tell me where I might find platform 93/4?

314
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,380
9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do you?

315
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,900
It's the same every year, packed with Muggles.

316
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,740
- Muggles? - Platform 9 3/4, this way.

317
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,580
All right, Percy, you first.

318
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,780
Fred, you next.

319
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,130
He's not Fred, I am.

320
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,700
Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

321
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,860
I'm sorry, George.

322
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,420
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

323
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,780
Excuse me.

324
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,660
Could you tell me how to...?

325
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,420
How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear.

326
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,100
It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.

327
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,720
All you do is walk straight

328
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,220
at the wall between platforms 9 and 10.

329
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,900
- Best to run if you're nervous. - Good luck.

330
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,740
Excuse me. Do you mind? Everywhere else is full.

331
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,180
Not at all.

332
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,660
I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

333
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,540
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

334
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,980
So... So it's true!

335
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,980
I mean, do you really have the...?

336
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,420
- The what? - The scar?

337
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,410
Oh, yeah.

338
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,820
Wicked!

339
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,970
Anything off the trolley, dears?

340
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,460
No, thanks. I'm all set.

341
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,780
We'll take the lot.

342
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,240
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?

343
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,300
They mean every flavor.

344
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,100
There's chocolate and peppermint and also...

345
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,140
...spinach, liver and tripe.

346
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,540
George sweared he got a booger-flavored one once.

347
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,100
Are they real frogs?

348
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,540
It's a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want.

349
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,100
Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard.

350
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,220
I've got about 500 meself.

351
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,020
Watch it!

352
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,780
That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them.

353
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,580
- I've got Dumbledore! - I got about six of him.

354
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,900
Hey, he's gone!

355
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,580
You can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?

356
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,300
This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he?

357
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,700
A little.

358
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,530
Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow.

359
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,240
- Want to see? - Yeah.

360
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,860
Has anyone seen a toad?

361
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,900
- A boy named Neville's lost one. - No.

362
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,820
Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see, then.

363
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,220
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

364
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,540
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

365
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,170
Are you sure that's a real spell?

366
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,940
Well, it's not very good, is it?

367
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,420
I've only tried a few simple ones myself...

368
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,220
...but they've all worked for me.

369
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,900
For example:

370
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,060
Oculus Reparo.

371
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,780
That's better, isn't it?

372
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,860
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

373
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,660
I'm Hermione Granger. And you are...?

374
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,580
- I'm Ron Weasley. - Pleasure.

375
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,400
You two better change into robes.

376
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,900
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

377
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,500
You've got dirt on your nose by the way. Did you know?

378
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,660
Just there.

379
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,780
Right, then. First years, this way, please!

380
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,220
Come on, first years, don't be shy. Come on now, hurry up.

381
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,180
- Hello, Harry. - Hi, Hagrid.

382
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,620
Right, then. This way to the boats. Come on now, follow me.

383
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,100
Wicked.

384
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,500
Welcome to Hogwarts.

385
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,970
Now, in a few moments you'll pass

386
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,740
through these doors and join your classmates.

387
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,270
But before you take your seats,

388
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,980
you must be sorted into your houses.

389
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,340
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

390
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,980
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

391
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,460
While you're here, your house will be like your family.

392
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,580
Your triumphs will earn you points.

393
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,940
Any rule-breaking and you will lose points.

394
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,810
At the end of the year,

395
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,420
the house with the most points wins the house cup.

396
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,980
Trevor!

397
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,540
Sorry.

398
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,700
The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.

399
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,380
It's true then, what they're saying on the train.

400
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,420
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

401
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,020
Harry Potter?

402
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,340
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

403
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,820
And I'm Malfoy.

404
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,500
Draco Malfoy.

405
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,500
Think my name's funny, do you?

406
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,060
I've no need to ask yours.

407
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:02,060
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley.

408
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,020
You'll find out some wizarding families are better than others, Potter.

409
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,020
You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.

410
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,420
I can help you there.

411
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,460
I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.

412
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,300
We're ready for you now. Follow me.

413
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,490
The ceiling isn't real.

414
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,380
It's bewitched to look like the night sky.

415
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,620
I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.

416
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,700
Will you wait along here, please?

417
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,940
Now, before we begin...

418
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,380
...Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.

419
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,380
I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce.

420
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,900
The first years, please note...

421
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:31,180
...that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students.

422
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,050
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,

423
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,940
has asked me to remind you...

424
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,780
...that the third-floor corridor is out of bounds...

425
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:46,300
...to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.

426
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,620
Thank you.

427
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,460
When I call your name, you will come forth.

428
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,300
I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head...

429
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,740
...and you will be sorted into your houses.

430
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,540
Hermione Granger.

431
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,420
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

432
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,180
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

433
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,540
Right, then. Right.

434
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,340
Okay. Gryffindor!

435
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,940
Draco Malfoy.

436
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,700
Slytherin!

437
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,580
Every wizard who went bad was in Slytherin.

438
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,300
Susan Bones.

439
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,980
Harry, what is it?

440
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,940
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

441
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,620
Let's see...

442
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,220
I know! Hufflepuff!

443
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,380
Ronald Weasley.

444
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:35,220
Another Weasley! I know just what to do with you.

445
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,220
Gryffindor!

446
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,940
Harry Potter.

447
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,020
Difficult, very difficult.

448
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,180
Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either.

449
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,700
There's talent, oh, yes.

450
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,740
And a thirst to prove yourself.

451
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,100
But where to put you?

452
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,180
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

453
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,060
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

454
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:33,180
You could be great, you know. It's all here, in your head.

455
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,380
And Slytherin will help you

456
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,700
on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.

457
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,660
No? Well, if you're sure.

458
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,620
Better be...

459
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,820
...Gryffindor!

460
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,540
We got Potter!

461
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,140
Your attention, please.

462
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,860
Let the feast begin.

463
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,340
I'm half and half.

464
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,820
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

465
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,540
Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.

466
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,340
Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

467
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,780
Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.

468
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,900
- What's he teach? - Potions.

469
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,450
But he fancies the Dark Arts Defences.

470
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,700
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

471
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,540
Hello! How are you?

472
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,180
Welcome to Gryffindor.

473
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,780
It's the Bloody Baron!

474
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,170
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

475
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,180
Have a nice summer?

476
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,670
Dismal. Once again, my request

477
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,820
to join the Headless Hunt has been denied.

478
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,780
I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.

479
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,740
I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind.

480
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,460
"Nearly" Headless? How can you be nearly headless?

481
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,780
Like this.

482
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,290
Gryffindors, follow me, please.

483
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,620
Keep up. Thank you.

484
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:12,140
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

485
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,740
This is the most direct path to the dormitories.

486
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,140
Keep an eye on the staircases. They like to change.

487
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,470
Keep up, please, and follow me.

488
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:35,060
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

489
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,940
That picture's moving.

490
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,660
- Look at that one. - I think she fancies you.

491
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,740
- Look! - Who's that girl?

492
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,500
Welcome to Hogwarts.

493
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,100
Password?

494
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,340
Caput Draconis.

495
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,980
Follow me, everyone. Keep up. Quickly, come on.

496
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,100
Gather around here.

497
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,100
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

498
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,840
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.

499
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,740
Girls, the same on your right.

500
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,060
Your belongings have already been brought up.

501
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,900
Made it!

502
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,740
Can you imagine the look

503
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,540
on old McGonagall's face if we were late?

504
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,170
That was bloody brilliant!

505
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:01,740
Thank you for that assessment.

506
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,140
Perhaps it'd be more usefully

507
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,260
if I transfigured Mr. Potter and yourself into a watch.

508
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,600
Then one of you might be on time.

509
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,660
We got lost.

510
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,720
Then perhaps a map?

511
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,620
I trust you don't need one to find your seats.

512
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,700
There will be no foolish

513
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,460
wand-waving or silly incantations in this class.

514
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,300
As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate...

515
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,260
...the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making.

516
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,580
However, for those select few...

517
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,820
...who possess the predisposition...

518
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,780
...I can teach you how to bewitch the mind...

519
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,940
...and ensnare the senses.

520
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,500
I can tell you how to bottle fame

521
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,180
brew glory

522
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,820
and even put a stopper in death.

523
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,840
Then again,

524
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,460
maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts

525
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,000
in possession with abilities so formidable

526
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,900
that you feel confident enough...

527
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,060
...to not pay attention.

528
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,620
Mr. Potter.

529
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,660
Our new celebrity.

530
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,030
What would I get if I added

531
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,620
root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

532
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,300
You don't know? Let's try again.

533
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:54,140
Where would you look if I asked you to find a bezoar?

534
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,820
I don't know, sir.

535
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,940
What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?

536
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,740
I don't know, sir.

537
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,100
Pity.

538
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,060
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

539
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,780
...is it, Mr. Potter?

540
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,550
Clearly, Hermione knows.

541
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,800
Seems a pity not to ask her.

542
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,120
Silence.

543
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,280
Put your hand down, you silly girl!

544
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,160
For your information, Potter...

545
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,830
...asphodel and wormwood make the sleeping potion so powerful

546
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,840
it is known the draught of the Living Dead.

547
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,040
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat's

548
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,400
and will save you from most of the poisons.

549
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,710
Monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant,

550
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,240
which also goes by the name of aconite.

551
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,000
Well...

552
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,440
...why aren't you all copying this down?

553
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,800
And Gryffindors...

554
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,320
...note that five points will be taken from your house...

555
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,840
...for your classmate's cheek.

556
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,250
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum.

557
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,920
Turn this water into rum

558
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,680
Eye of rabbit...

559
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,680
What's Seamus going to do to that glass of water?

560
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,010
Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday,

561
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,640
before...

562
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,280
Mail's here.

563
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,520
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

564
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,640
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

565
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,810
I've read about those. The

566
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:58,360
smoke turns red when you've forgotten something.

567
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,080
The problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.

568
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,800
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

569
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,680
"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

570
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,460
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge

571
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,640
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

572
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,440
The vault in question, number 713,

573
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,560
had been emptied earlier that same day. "

574
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,040
That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.

575
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,360
Good afternoon, class.

576
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,680
Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

577
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,720
Good afternoon, Amanda. Good afternoon.

578
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,440
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

579
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,600
What are you waiting for? Step up to the left side of the broomstick.

580
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,610
Come on now, hurry up.

581
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:55,400
Stick your right hand over the broom and say, "Up. "

582
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,560
Up!

583
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,760
Up.

584
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,080
Up.

585
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,400
Up. Up!

586
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,600
With feeling.

587
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,400
Shut up, Harry.

588
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,280
Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it.

589
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,480
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be sliding off than.

590
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,560
When I blow my whistle,

591
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,840
I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard.

592
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,880
Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment...

593
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,400
...then lean forward slightly and touch back down.

594
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,760
On my whistle. Three, two...

595
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,560
Mr. Longbottom.

596
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,080
- Mr. Longbottom! - Down, down!

597
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,520
Neville!

598
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,920
Come back down this instant!

599
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,280
Everyone out of the way!

600
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,000
Is he all right?

601
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,860
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.

602
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,040
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

603
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,810
Everyone has to Keep his feet firmly on the

604
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:55,000
ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing.

605
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,880
Understand? I see a single broom in the air...

606
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,050
...the one riding it will find himself

607
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:04,360
be expelled from Hogwarts before they can say Quidditch.

608
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,480
Did you see his face?

609
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,100
If he had squeezed this,

610
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,520
he'd have remembered to fall on his arse.

611
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,240
Give it here, Malfoy.

612
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,760
No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.

613
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,400
How about on the roof?

614
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,400
What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?

615
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,760
Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said.

616
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,880
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

617
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,080
What an idiot.

618
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,960
Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!

619
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,320
Is that so?

620
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,720
Have it your way, then.

621
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,130
Nice going, Harry.

622
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,080
That was wicked, Harry!

623
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,360
Harry Potter!

624
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,320
Follow me.

625
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,240
You wait here.

626
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,830
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.

627
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,280
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

628
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,320
Yes, of course.

629
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,250
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.

630
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,760
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

631
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,530
Have you heard?

632
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,360
Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker.

633
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,800
I always knew he'd do well.

634
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,320
Seeker? But first years never make the house teams.

635
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,110
You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...

636
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,040
A century, McGonagall says.

637
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,880
Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us.

638
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,560
Fred and George are on the team,too. Beaters.

639
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,480
Our job is to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad.

640
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,360
Can't make any promises. Rough game, Quidditch.

641
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,560
But no one's died in years. Someone vanishes occasionally.

642
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,520
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

643
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,860
Go on,Harry. Quidditch is great.

644
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,400
Best game there is, and you'll be great too.

645
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,800
I've never played. What if I make a fool of myself?

646
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,040
You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.

647
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,400
You never told me your father was a Seeker too.

648
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,440
I didn't know.

649
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,980
I'm telling you, it's spooky.

650
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,560
She knows more about you than you do.

651
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,040
Who doesn't?

652
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,080
What's happening?

653
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,520
The staircases change, remember?

654
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,440
- Let's go this way. - Before the staircase moves again.

655
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,480
Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be here?

656
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,880
We're not supposed to be here.

657
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,000
This is the third floor. It's forbidden.

658
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,760
Let's go.

659
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,840
- It's Filch's cat! - Run!

660
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,960
Quick, let's hide through that door!

661
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,160
- It's locked! - We're done for!

662
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,520
Move over!

663
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,600
Alohomora.

664
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,400
Get in.

665
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,760
Alohomora?

666
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,480
Standard Book of Spells, chapter seven.

667
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,080
Anyone here, my sweet?

668
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,320
Come on.

669
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,680
- Filch is gone. - He thinks this door's locked.

670
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,560
- It was locked. - And for good reason.

671
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,850
What are they doing,

672
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:29,720
keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?

673
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,580
You didn't use your eyes, aren't you?

674
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,600
Didn't you see what it was standing on?

675
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,960
I wasn't looking at its feet! I was preoccupied with its heads.

676
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,040
Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three!

677
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,920
It was standing on a trap door. It wasn't there by accident.

678
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,680
- It's guarding something. - Guarding something?

679
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,150
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,

680
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:55,360
I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another idea

681
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,680
to get us killed.

682
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,040
Or worse, expelled.

683
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,560
She needs to sort out her priorities.

684
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,400
Quidditch is easy to understand. Each team has seven players.

685
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,680
Three Chasers, two Beaters,

686
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,320
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

687
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,520
There are three kinds of balls. This one's called the Quaffle.

688
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,110
The Chasers handle the Quaffle

689
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:37,680
and try to put it through one of those hoops.

690
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,280
The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far?

691
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,960
I think so. What are those?

692
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,400
You better take this.

693
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,280
Careful now, it's coming back.

694
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,660
Not bad, Potter.

695
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,480
You'd make a fair Beater.

696
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,400
What was that?

697
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,920
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

698
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,640
But you are a Seeker.

699
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:49,800
The only thing I want you to worry about is this.

700
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,560
The Golden Snitch.

701
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,760
- I like this ball. - You like it now.

702
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

703
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,160
What do I do with it?

704
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,600
You catch it. Before the other team's Seeker.

705
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,320
You catch this, the game's over.

706
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,480
You catch this, Potter, and we win.

707
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,630
One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills

708
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,880
is levitation...

709
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,080
...or the ability to make objects fly.

710
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,680
Do you have your feathers? Good.

711
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,220
Now, don't forget the nice wrist movement

712
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,080
we've been practicing.

713
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,600
The swish and flick. Everyone.

714
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,860
The swish and flick.

715
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,800
Good. Oh, and enunciate.

716
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:53,800
Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go, then.

717
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,320
Wingardium Leviosa.

718
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,920
Wingardium Leviosa.

719
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,610
No, stop, stop, stop!

720
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:08,000
You're going to take someone's eye out.

721
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,270
Besides, you're saying it wrong.

722
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:14,240
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

723
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,040
You do it then, if you're so clever. Go on, go on.

724
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,360
Wingardium Leviosa.

725
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,090
Well done!  See here, everyone,

726
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:36,520
Miss Granger's done it!

727
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,360
Splendid!

728
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,160
Well done, dear.

729
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,480
I think we're going to need another feather over here, professor.

730
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,240
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. "

731
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,790
She's a nightmare, honestly!

732
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,840
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

733
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,040
I think she heard you.

734
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,760
Where's Hermione?

735
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,120
Parvati said she wouldn't come out of the bathroom.

736
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,400
She said that she'd been in there all afternoon, crying.

737
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,480
Troll in the dungeon!

738
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,080
Troll in the dungeon!

739
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,200
Thought you ought to know.

740
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,920
Silence!

741
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,560
Everyone will please not panic!

742
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,800
Now

743
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,560
prefects will lead their house back to the dormitories.

744
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,080
Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.

745
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,280
Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay alert.

746
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,240
How could a troll get in?

747
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,460
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.

748
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,640
Probably people playing jokes.

749
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,840
- What? - Hermione! She doesn't know.

750
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,200
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

751
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,240
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

752
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,640
Hermione, move!

753
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,160
Help! Help!

754
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,240
Hey, pea brain!

755
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,560
Help!

756
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,080
Do something!

757
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,480
- What? - Anything!

758
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,520
- Hurry up! - Swish and flick.

759
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,040
Wingardium Leviosa.

760
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,960
Cool.

761
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,200
Is it dead?

762
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,360
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

763
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,920
Troll boogers.

764
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,000
Oh, my goodness! Explain yourselves, both of you!

765
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,650
Well, what it is...

766
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,840
It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

767
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,200
Miss Granger?

768
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,870
I went looking for the troll.

769
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,160
I thought I could handle it.

770
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,240
But I was wrong.

771
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,690
If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me,

772
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:14,520
I'd probably be dead.

773
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,920
Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do.

774
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,460
I expected more rational behavior

775
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,800
and am very disappointed in you.

776
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Five points will be taken from Gryffindor

777
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,800
for your serious lack of judgment.

778
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,280
As for you two gentlemen.

779
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,920
I just hope you realize how fortunate you are.

780
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,520
Not many first-year students could take on a troll

781
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,360
and live to tell the tale.

782
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,040
Five points

783
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,560
will be awarded to each of you

784
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:57,200
for sheer dumb luck.

785
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,560
Perhaps you ought to go. It might wake up.

786
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:18,260
Good of you to get us out of trouble.

787
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,270
We did save her life.

788
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:25,110
She might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her.

789
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:28,630
What are friends for?

790
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:33,500
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

791
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,900
Ron's right. You'll need your strength today.

792
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,340
I'm not hungry.

793
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,340
Good luck today, Potter.

794
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,540
You've proven yourself against a troll.

795
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,940
A game of Quidditch should be easy work.

796
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:52,260
Even if it is against Slytherin.

797
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:03,340
- That explains the blood. - Blood?

798
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:07,900
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion

799
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,780
so he could get past that dog.

800
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,740
But he got bit, that's why he's limping.

801
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,220
But why would anyone go near that dog?

802
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,140
At Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of the vault.

803
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,580
Said it was Hogwarts business, very secret.

804
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,900
You're saying...

805
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,110
That's what the dog's guarding.

806
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,620
That's what Snape wants.

807
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,760
Bit early for mail, isn't it?

808
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,740
But I never get mail.

809
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,820
Let's open it.

810
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,260
It's a broomstick.

811
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,000
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,

812
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,180
it's a Nimbus 2000!

813
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,660
But who...?

814
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,930
Scared, Harry?

815
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:32,820
A little.

816
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:36,700
It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.

817
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,840
What happened?

818
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,420
I don't really remember.

819
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,380
I took a Bludger to the head two minutes in.

820
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:46,420
Woke up in hospital a week later.

821
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:11,980
Hello. Welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season.

822
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,900
Today's game, Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

823
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,660
The players take their positions

824
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,660
as Madam Hooch steps onto the field to begin the game!

825
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:57,180
Now, I want a nice, clean game

826
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:00,260
from all of you!

827
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:08,300
The Bludgers are up, followed by the Golden Snitch.

828
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,220
Remember, the Snitch is worth 150 points.

829
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:15,220
The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.

830
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:25,460
The Quaffle is released and the game begins!

831
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:48,940
Angelina Johnson scores! Ten points for Gryffindor!

832
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,420
Well done!

833
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:02,130
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.

834
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:05,500
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

835
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,340
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

836
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,020
Give me that!

837
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,100
Take that side!

838
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,820
What's going on with Harry's broomstick?

839
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:33,940
It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom!

840
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:38,540
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do? - Leave it to me.

841
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,860
Come on, Hermione!

842
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:19,700
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

843
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:29,860
Fire! You're on fire!

844
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,860
Go, go, go, go!

845
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:44,220
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

846
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,740
He's got the Snitch!

847
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:51,060
Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!

848
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,940
Gryffindor wins!

849
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,780
Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?

850
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,900
Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog?

851
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,540
- Who told you about Fluffy? - Fluffy?

852
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:48,770
That thing has a name?

853
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:51,420
Of course he has a name. He's mine.

854
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:53,980
I bought him off an Irishman.

855
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:56,900
- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard... - Yes?

856
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,000
Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more question!

857
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,700
That's top-secret.

858
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,300
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,

859
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,300
Snape's trying to steal it.

860
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,980
Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.

861
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,750
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one.

862
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,540
I've read all about them.

863
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:19,340
You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking.

864
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,820
Exactly.

865
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:25,220
Now, you listen to me, all three of you.

866
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,020
You're meddling in things

867
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:30,100
that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

868
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,210
What that dog is guarding

869
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:35,420
is between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

870
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,020
Nicholas Flamel?

871
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:42,740
I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that.

872
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:47,060
Nicholas Flamel. Who's Nicholas Flamel?

873
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,260
I don't know.

874
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,940
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

875
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,980
Ring the Hogwarts bell

876
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:16,980
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

877
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:20,100
Cast a Christmas spell

878
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,060
Knight to e5.

879
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:46,900
Queen to e5.

880
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:53,940
That's totally barbaric!

881
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:55,950
That's wizard's chess.

882
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:58,100
I see you've packed.

883
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,780
I see you haven't.

884
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,100
Change of plans. My parents decided to

885
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:05,300
go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

886
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,920
He's studying dragons there.

887
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,340
Good. You can help Harry.

888
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,900
He's going to the library to look up Nicholas Flamel.

889
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:16,620
We've looked a hundred times!

890
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:20,080
Not in the restricted section.

891
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,500
Happy Christmas.

892
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:27,660
I think we've had a bad influence on her.

893
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:34,540
Harry, wake up! Come on, Harry, wake up!

894
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,040
Happy Christmas, Harry.

895
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,700
Happy Christmas, Ron.

896
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,140
What are you wearing?

897
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:54,420
Oh, my mum made it. Looks like you've got one too.

898
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,980
- I've got presents? - Yeah.

899
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,460
There they are.

900
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:21,980
"Your father left this in my possession before he died.

901
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:26,380
It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. "

902
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,040
What is it?

903
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,900
Some kind of cloak.

904
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:50,100
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

905
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:56,820
My body's gone!

906
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:00,620
I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak!

907
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,060
I'm invisible?

908
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:05,250
They're really rare.

909
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,140
I wonder who gave it to you.

910
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:13,220
There was no name. It just said, "Use it well. "

911
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,740
Famous Fire-Eaters.

912
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:47,140
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

913
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:53,220
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where are you?

914
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,940
Who's there?

915
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:25,700
I know you're in there. You can't hide.

916
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:36,820
Who is it? Show yourself.

917
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:25,380
Severus, I...

918
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:29,940
You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.

919
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,180
I don't know what you mean.

920
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:34,860
You know perfectly well what I mean.

921
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:55,300
We'll have another little chat soon.

922
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:00,940
When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.

923
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:05,620
Professors. I found this in the restricted section.

924
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:11,220
It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.

925
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:13,220
"I show not your face but your heart desire"

926
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:13,220
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi

927
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,140
Mum?

928
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,380
Dad?

929
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:30,100
Ron, you've really gotta see this! Ron, you've gotta see this!

930
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:34,820
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

931
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:38,620
- Why? - There's something you've got to see! Come on.

932
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:49,620
Come on! Come! Come look, it's my parents!

933
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,060
I only see us.

934
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,620
Look in properly. Go on, stand there.

935
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:02,780
- There. You see them, don't you? - That's me! Only I'm head boy.

936
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:05,620
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

937
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:10,020
And bloody hell! I'm Quidditch captain too!

938
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,620
I look good.

939
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:18,060
Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?

940
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:23,260
How can it? Both my parents are dead.

941
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,120
Do you like yours, Ron?

942
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:47,040
- Ron? - I'll be right back.

943
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,690
Wanna play chess?

944
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:00,200
No.

945
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,550
Wanna go and visit Hagrid?

946
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:04,960
No.

947
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,720
Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't.

948
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,880
There's something not right about that mirror.

949
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,540
Back again, Harry?

950
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:47,140
I see that you, like so many before you

951
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:51,540
have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.

952
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:56,020
I trust by now you realize what it does.

953
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,860
Let me give you a clue.

954
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,540
The happiest man on earth

955
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:06,140
would look in the mirror and see only himself

956
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,660
exactly as he is.

957
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:13,940
So then, it shows us what we want. Whatever we want.

958
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:17,500
Yes. And no.

959
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:20,380
It shows us nothing more or less

960
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:26,580
than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts.

961
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:31,500
Now you, Harry, who have never known your family.

962
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:35,580
You see them standing beside you.

963
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,180
But remember this, Harry.

964
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:44,340
This mirror gives us neither knowledge

965
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:46,660
or truth.

966
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:53,660
Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad.

967
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:58,860
That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home.

968
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:00,980
And I must ask you

969
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:05,820
not to go looking for it again.

970
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:09,700
It does not do to dwell on dreams

971
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:13,140
and forget to live.

972
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,480
Hi, Hedwig.

973
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:17,120
Look at you, playing with your cards. Pathetic!

974
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,400
We've got final exams soon.

975
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,480
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

976
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:27,040
All right. What are the ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?

977
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,480
I forgot.

978
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,720
What do you plan to do if it's in the exam?

979
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
- Copy off you. - No, you won't.

980
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,480
Besides, we're to be given

981
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:40,120
special quills with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

982
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,780
That's insulting!

983
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:46,680
It's as if they don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

984
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:54,360
- Leg-Locker Curse? - Malfoy.

985
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,600
You have got to start standing up to people. Neville

986
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:06,320
How? I can barely stand at all!

987
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,600
I'll do the countercurse!

988
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,840
No, that's all I need!

989
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:13,200
You to set my kneecaps on fire!

990
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:16,680
I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom.

991
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,040
Besides, if anyone cared to notice

992
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,640
my eyebrows have completely grown back!

993
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,920
I found him!

994
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,490
"Dumbledore is particularly famous for

995
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:36,140
his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."

996
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:39,190
- Go on! - "For his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...

997
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:42,550
and his welcomed alchemy with his partner Nicholas Flamel"!

998
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,680
I knew the name sounded familiar.

999
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,500
I read it on the train that day.

1000
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:47,600
Follow me!

1001
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,560
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

1002
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,640
What about the countercurse?

1003
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,890
I had you looking in the wrong section.

1004
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,570
How could I be so stupid?

1005
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:11,830
I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

1006
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:14,310
This is light?

1007
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,400
Of course! Here it is!

1008
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,780
Nicholas Flamel is the

1009
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:25,770
only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

1010
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:27,040
The what?

1011
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:29,670
Honestly, don't you two read?

1012
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:31,750
"The Philosopher's Stone

1013
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:34,730
is a legendary substance with astonishing powers.

1014
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,990
It'll transform any metal into pure gold,

1015
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:39,920
and produces the Elixir of Life

1016
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,130
which will make the drinker immortal. "

1017
01:44:42,130 --> 01:44:44,670
- Immortal? - It means you'll never die.

1018
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:46,380
I know what it means!

1019
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:50,290
"The only Stone currently in existence

1020
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,600
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel,

1021
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,720
the noted alchemist who last year

1022
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:57,980
celebrated his 665th birthday."

1023
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:01,450
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the third floor.

1024
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:04,460
That's what's under the trap door. The Philosopher's Stone.

1025
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,160
- Hagrid. - Oh, hello.

1026
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:25,370
Sorry, don't wish to be rude,

1027
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:27,460
but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.

1028
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,470
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

1029
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,590
We think Snape's trying to steal it.

1030
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:39,820
Snape? Come on, are you still on about him, aren't you?

1031
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:41,930
Hagrid, we know he's after the stone,

1032
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:43,180
we just don't know why.

1033
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,340
Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone.

1034
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,030
He's not about to steal it.

1035
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:48,780
What?

1036
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:52,690
You heard. Alright, come on now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.

1037
01:45:52,690 --> 01:45:55,440
Wait a minute. "One of the teachers"?

1038
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,480
Of course!

1039
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,220
There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?

1040
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,970
- Spells, enchantments. - That's right.

1041
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:04,660
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

1042
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:07,200
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

1043
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:11,300
Ain't a soul knows how, except for me and Dumbledore.

1044
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:14,750
I shouldn't have told you that. I should not have told you that.

1045
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,760
Hagrid, what exactly is that?

1046
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,720
That? It's a...it's um...

1047
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,600
I know what that is!

1048
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,660
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

1049
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:42,740
I won it. Off a stranger I met down at the pub.

1050
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:46,500
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter of fact.

1051
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:12,720
Is that...

1052
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,050
a dragon?

1053
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:16,260
That's not just a dragon.

1054
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,360
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

1055
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:21,670
My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.

1056
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:24,220
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.

1057
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,270
Look, he knows his mummy.

1058
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:28,310
Hello, Norbert.

1059
01:47:29,450 --> 01:47:30,690
Norbert?

1060
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:32,510
Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he?

1061
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,910
Don't you, Norbert?

1062
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:45,740
He'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.

1063
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:52,090
Who's that?

1064
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:55,660
Malfoy.

1065
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,580
Oh, dear.

1066
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:02,290
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.

1067
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:04,870
Told me so the first time I ever met him.

1068
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:09,700
It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.

1069
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:13,210
- I don't understand. Is that bad? - It's bad.

1070
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,490
Good evening.

1071
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,920
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

1072
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,030
gives a student the right to walk about the school at night.

1073
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:29,700
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,

1074
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,790
50 points will be taken.

1075
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:34,540
-50?! - Each.

1076
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,750
And to ensure it doesn't happen again,

1077
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:40,590
all four of you will receive detention.

1078
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:45,230
Excuse me, professor, perhaps I heard you wrong.

1079
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:47,740
I thought you said the four of us.

1080
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:50,520
No, you heard me correctly, Mr Malfoy.

1081
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,750
You see, honorable as your intentions were,

1082
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:55,490
but you too were out of bed after hours.

1083
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,860
You will join your classmates in detention.

1084
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:13,210
A pity they let the old punishments die.

1085
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:16,050
There was a time detention would found you

1086
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:18,540
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

1087
01:49:19,570 --> 01:49:21,550
God, I miss the screaming.

1088
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:27,890
You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight.

1089
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:32,810
He's got a little job to do inside the Dark Forest.

1090
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:37,620
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

1091
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:41,480
Oh, good God, man.

1092
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,040
You're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?

1093
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,880
Norbert's gone.

1094
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:53,700
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.

1095
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:55,230
Well, that's good, isn't it?

1096
01:49:55,230 --> 01:49:56,760
He'll be with his own kind.

1097
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:59,250
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

1098
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:02,090
What if the other dragons are mean to him?

1099
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,860
He's only a baby after all.

1100
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:07,350
Oh for God's sake, pulI yourself together, man.

1101
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,250
You're going into the Forest after all.

1102
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:12,460
Got to have your wits about you.

1103
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,310
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.

1104
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:17,410
We can't go in there.

1105
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,590
Students aren't allowed.

1106
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:22,430
And there are...

1107
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:25,770
werewolves.

1108
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:28,470
Oh, there's more than werewolves in those trees, eh.

1109
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:31,010
You can be sure of that.

1110
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,430
Nighty-night.

1111
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:41,090
Right. Let's go.

1112
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:21,440
Hagrid, what is that?

1113
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:24,320
What we're here for. See that?

1114
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,400
That's unicorn blood, that is.

1115
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:30,700
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

1116
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:35,210
Now, this one's been hurt bad by something.

1117
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,810
So, it's our job

1118
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:49,370
to go and find the poor beast.

1119
01:51:49,650 --> 01:51:51,530
Ron, Hermione, you come with me.

1120
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,580
Ok.

1121
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:55,450
Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

1122
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,710
Okay. Then I get Fang.

1123
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:04,850
Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.

1124
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:11,790
You wait till my father hears about this.

1125
01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:14,010
This is servant's stuff.

1126
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,730
If I didn't know better, Draco,

1127
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:18,570
I'd say you were scared.

1128
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,940
I'm not scared,  Potter.

1129
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:23,780
Do you hear that?

1130
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:28,180
Come on, Fang.

1131
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:29,970
Scared!

1132
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:56,450
What is it, Fang?

1133
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:11,080
Harry Potter, you must leave.

1134
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:13,310
You are known to many creatures here.

1135
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:17,810
The Forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.

1136
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:20,610
But what was that thing you saved me from?

1137
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:22,680
A monstrous creature.

1138
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:26,300
It is a terrible crime to slay an unicorn.

1139
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:29,230
Drinking the blood of an unicorn will keep you alive

1140
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:31,480
even if you are an inch from death.

1141
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:33,900
But at a terrible price.

1142
01:54:34,410 --> 01:54:36,870
For you have slain something so pure

1143
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:39,880
that from the moment the blood touches your lips,

1144
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:42,100
you will have a half-life.

1145
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,870
A cursed life.

1146
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:46,480
But who would choose such a life?

1147
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,890
Can you think of no one?

1148
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:53,080
Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn...

1149
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:55,790
that was drinking its blood,

1150
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,980
that was Voldemort?

1151
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:59,720
Do you know what is hidden in the school

1152
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:02,350
at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

1153
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:05,580
The Philosopher's Stone.

1154
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:08,210
Harry!

1155
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:10,770
Hello there, Firenze.

1156
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:13,140
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

1157
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,360
You all right there, Harry?

1158
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:20,650
Harry Potter, this is where I leave you.

1159
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:26,270
You're safe now. Good luck.

1160
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:38,300
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there right now in the Forest?

1161
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:41,120
But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns.

1162
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:43,990
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

1163
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:46,770
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.

1164
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:48,230
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

1165
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,960
With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again.

1166
01:55:52,210 --> 01:55:53,000
He'll...

1167
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:55,410
He'll come back.

1168
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:57,710
But if he comes back,

1169
01:55:57,710 --> 01:56:01,520
you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?

1170
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:05,530
If he'd had the chance, he might have tried tonight.

1171
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:10,220
And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.

1172
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:13,290
Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing.

1173
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:17,780
Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?

1174
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:20,890
Dumbledore.

1175
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,620
As long as Dumbledore is around, Harry, you're safe.

1176
01:56:25,190 --> 01:56:28,680
As long as Dumbledore is around, you can't be touched.

1177
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:38,170
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end-of-year exams were frightful,

1178
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:40,620
but I found that rather enjoyable.

1179
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:43,510
Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?

1180
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:47,510
My scar. It keeps burning.

1181
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:49,750
It's happened before.

1182
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:51,050
Not like this.

1183
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:52,860
Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1184
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:56,080
I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming.

1185
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:06,130
- Of course! - What is it?

1186
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:08,140
Don't you think it's a bit odd

1187
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:10,270
that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon,

1188
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:12,870
and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one?

1189
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:14,930
I mean, how many people wander around

1190
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:16,420
with dragon eggs in their pocket?

1191
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:18,130
Why didn't I see it before?

1192
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,750
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?

1193
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,090
What did he look like?

1194
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,230
I don't know, I never saw his face.

1195
01:57:30,230 --> 01:57:30,970
He kept his hood up.

1196
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:34,110
This stanger though, you and he must have talked.

1197
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:37,910
Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after.

1198
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,360
I told him, I said, "After Fluffy,

1199
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:42,360
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

1200
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:44,060
Then is he interested in Fluffy?

1201
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:46,830
Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1202
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:49,440
How often do you come across a three-headed dog?

1203
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,670
Even if you were in the trade.

1204
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:53,940
But I told him, I said, I said that

1205
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,360
"The trick with any beast

1206
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,170
is to know how to calm him."

1207
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:58,760
Take Fluffy, for example.

1208
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:01,610
Just play him a little bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.

1209
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:06,110
I shouldn't have told you that.

1210
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:08,800
Where are you going? Wait!

1211
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:19,490
We have to see professor Dumbledore. Immediately!

1212
01:58:19,910 --> 01:58:22,170
I'm afraid professor Dumbledore is not here.

1213
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:26,040
He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic

1214
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,510
and left immediately for London.

1215
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:29,910
He's gone? But this is important!

1216
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:32,610
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

1217
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:36,970
- How do you know...? - Someone's going to try and steal it.

1218
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:40,730
I don't know how you three found out about the Stone,

1219
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:43,070
but I assure you it is perfectly well protected.

1220
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:47,800
Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.

1221
01:58:56,690 --> 01:58:58,750
That was no stranger Hagrid have met, isn't it?

1222
01:58:58,750 --> 01:58:59,760
It was Snape.

1223
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:02,400
Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.

1224
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,270
- And with Dumbledore gone... - Good afternoon.

1225
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:11,770
Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves

1226
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:15,600
be doing inside on a day like this?

1227
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:23,260
- We were just... - You ought to be careful.

1228
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:26,580
People will think you're...

1229
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:32,990
up to something.

1230
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:45,660
Now what do we do?

1231
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:49,410
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1232
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:05,250
Trevor.

1233
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:08,190
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

1234
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:10,970
Neither should you.

1235
02:00:12,690 --> 02:00:14,510
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1236
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:16,970
Now, Neville, listen. We were...

1237
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:19,270
No, I won't let you!

1238
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:21,200
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.

1239
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:24,160
I'll fight you.

1240
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:26,520
Neville, I'm really really sorry about this.

1241
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:28,440
Petrificus Totalus.

1242
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:39,730
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that?

1243
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:43,350
Brilliant, but scary.

1244
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:46,050
Let's go.

1245
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:50,280
- Sorry. - It's for your own good, you know.

1246
02:00:56,630 --> 02:00:58,070
You stood on my foot!

1247
02:00:58,740 --> 02:00:59,650
Sorry.

1248
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:05,720
Alohomora.

1249
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:20,660
Wait a minute. He's...

1250
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,370
snoring.

1251
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:28,440
Snape's already been here.

1252
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:31,360
He's put a spell on the harp.

1253
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:35,840
It's got horrible breath.

1254
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:41,860
- We have to move its paw. - What?

1255
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:43,080
Come on!

1256
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,470
Okay. Push.

1257
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:15,990
I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.

1258
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:20,440
If something bad happens, get yourselves out.

1259
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:25,820
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1260
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:27,490
The harp.

1261
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:30,490
It's stopped playing.

1262
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:42,900
Jump!

1263
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,500
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1264
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:18,410
Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare.

1265
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:20,640
You have to relax. If you don't,

1266
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:22,350
it will only kill you faster.

1267
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:25,960
Kill us faster? Oh, now I can relax!

1268
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,000
Hermione!

1269
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:34,410
- Now what are we gonna do? - Just relax!

1270
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:36,930
Hermione, where are you?

1271
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:40,090
Do what I say! Trust me.

1272
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:49,750
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.

1273
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:53,030
- He's not relaxing, is he? - Apparently not.

1274
02:03:53,230 --> 02:03:55,790
- We've gotta do something. - What?

1275
02:03:55,990 --> 02:03:58,910
I remember reading something in Herbology.

1276
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:03,630
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. It's deadly fun

1277
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:08,190
but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight.

1278
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:10,510
Lumus Solem.

1279
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:21,190
- Ron, you okay? - Yeah.

1280
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:26,350
Lucky we didn't panic.

1281
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:30,590
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.

1282
02:04:32,230 --> 02:04:33,710
What is that?

1283
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:37,630
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1284
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:54,230
Curious. I've never seen birds like these.

1285
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:58,070
They're not birds. They're keys.

1286
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:01,750
And I'll bet one of them fits that door.

1287
02:05:05,230 --> 02:05:09,830
- What's this all about? - I don't know.

1288
02:05:15,710 --> 02:05:17,790
Strange.

1289
02:05:18,190 --> 02:05:20,470
Alohomora!

1290
02:05:23,430 --> 02:05:25,710
Well, it was worth a try.

1291
02:05:25,910 --> 02:05:29,150
What will we do? There must be a thousand keys.

1292
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:31,380
We want a big, old-fashioned one.

1293
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:33,270
Probably rusty like the handle.

1294
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:36,910
I see it! The one with the broken wing.

1295
02:05:40,510 --> 02:05:42,830
What's wrong, Harry?

1296
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:45,230
It's too simple.

1297
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:47,690
Go on, Harry!

1298
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:49,990
If Snape could catch it on that old broomstick,

1299
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:50,890
you can.

1300
02:05:50,890 --> 02:05:53,950
You're the youngest Seeker in a century.

1301
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:13,790
This complicates things a bit.

1302
02:06:35,070 --> 02:06:36,990
Catch the key!

1303
02:06:41,390 --> 02:06:43,310
Hurry up!

1304
02:07:15,790 --> 02:07:20,470
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.

1305
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:23,870
Where are we? A graveyard.

1306
02:07:24,230 --> 02:07:26,870
This is no graveyard.

1307
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:37,270
It's a chessboard.

1308
02:07:49,270 --> 02:07:51,190
There's the door.

1309
02:08:03,230 --> 02:08:04,750
Now what do we do?

1310
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:06,570
It's obvious, isn't it?

1311
02:08:06,570 --> 02:08:09,230
We've got to play our way across the room.

1312
02:08:09,830 --> 02:08:13,590
Alright, Harry, you take the empty bishop's square.

1313
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:18,110
Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle.

1314
02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:22,430
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1315
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:31,310
What happens now?

1316
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:35,110
Well, white moves first.

1317
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:37,190
And then

1318
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:40,190
we play.

1319
02:08:51,290 --> 02:08:55,830
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like

1320
02:08:56,070 --> 02:08:59,630
real wizard's chess, do you?

1321
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:02,950
You there, d5.

1322
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:19,150
Yes, Hermione.

1323
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:24,330
I think this is gonna be exactly like wizard's chess.

1324
02:09:30,350 --> 02:09:32,870
Castle to e4!

1325
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:38,790
Pawn to c3!

1326
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:27,430
- Wait a minute. - You understand right, Harry.

1327
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:32,390
Once I make my move, the queen will take me.

1328
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:35,350
Then you're free to check the king.

1329
02:10:35,550 --> 02:10:38,270
- No. Ron, no! - What is it?

1330
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:41,280
He's going to sacrifice himself.

1331
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,550
No, you can't, there must be another way!

1332
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:47,510
Do you wanna stop Snape from getting that Stone or not?

1333
02:10:47,710 --> 02:10:51,310
Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it.

1334
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:54,550
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1335
02:11:04,830 --> 02:11:07,750
Knight to h3.

1336
02:11:28,670 --> 02:11:30,670
Check.

1337
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:01,630
Ron!

1338
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:04,520
No, don't move!

1339
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:07,630
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1340
02:12:22,710 --> 02:12:23,990
Checkmate.

1341
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:46,430
Take care of Ron. Then go to the owlery.

1342
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:50,510
Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right.

1343
02:12:50,710 --> 02:12:52,590
I have to go on.

1344
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:55,330
You'll be okay, Harry.

1345
02:12:56,330 --> 02:12:59,030
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1346
02:12:59,830 --> 02:13:01,750
Not as good as you.

1347
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:05,470
Me? Books and cleverness.

1348
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:07,390
There are more important things.

1349
02:13:08,630 --> 02:13:11,120
Friendship and bravery.

1350
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,230
And, Harry, just be careful.

1351
02:13:52,310 --> 02:13:53,990
You?

1352
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:58,630
No, it can't be. Snape, he was the...

1353
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:02,340
Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he?

1354
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:05,230
Next to him, who would suspect

1355
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:09,350
poor, stuttering Professor Quirrell?

1356
02:14:09,550 --> 02:14:13,470
But that day, during the Quidditch match,

1357
02:14:14,060 --> 02:14:15,660
Snape tried to kill me.

1358
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:18,730
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1359
02:14:18,930 --> 02:14:22,190
And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire

1360
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:23,680
and broken my eye contact

1361
02:14:23,830 --> 02:14:25,030
I would have succeeded.

1362
02:14:26,230 --> 02:14:29,200
Even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.

1363
02:14:29,590 --> 02:14:31,770
Snape was trying to save me?

1364
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:34,200
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off,

1365
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:36,190
especially after Halloween.

1366
02:14:36,430 --> 02:14:39,050
Then you let the troll in!

1367
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:40,670
Very good, Potter, yes.

1368
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:44,720
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1369
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:46,320
While everyone was running about the dongeon,

1370
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:49,430
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1371
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:53,830
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1372
02:14:55,470 --> 02:15:00,110
He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand.

1373
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:04,350
I'm never alone. Never.

1374
02:15:04,550 --> 02:15:08,670
Now, what does this mirror do?

1375
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:12,350
I see what I desire.

1376
02:15:12,910 --> 02:15:15,020
I see myself holding the Stone.

1377
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:17,350
But how do I get it?

1378
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:19,710
Use the boy.

1379
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:24,430
Come here, Potter! Now!

1380
02:15:36,510 --> 02:15:40,510
Tell me, what do you see?

1381
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:08,070
What is it? What do you see?

1382
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:11,030
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.

1383
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:13,470
I've won the house cup.

1384
02:16:13,670 --> 02:16:15,230
He lies.

1385
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:19,430
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1386
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:22,750
Let me speak to him.

1387
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:24,570
Master, you are not strong enough.

1388
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:27,930
I have strength enough for this.

1389
02:16:46,470 --> 02:16:49,350
Harry Potter

1390
02:16:49,550 --> 02:16:51,870
we meet again.

1391
02:16:52,110 --> 02:16:53,510
Voldemort.

1392
02:16:53,710 --> 02:16:57,670
Yes. You see what I've become?

1393
02:16:57,950 --> 02:17:01,510
See what I must do to survive?

1394
02:17:01,710 --> 02:17:05,870
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1395
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:09,870
Unicorn blood can sustain me

1396
02:17:10,070 --> 02:17:13,750
but it cannot give me a body of my own.

1397
02:17:13,950 --> 02:17:17,510
But there is something that can.

1398
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:23,390
Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.

1399
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:25,310
Stop him!

1400
02:17:30,350 --> 02:17:33,110
Don't be a fool.

1401
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:36,710
Why suffer an horrific death

1402
02:17:36,910 --> 02:17:40,550
when you can join me and live?

1403
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:41,830
Never!

1404
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:48,630
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1405
02:17:49,390 --> 02:17:52,710
Tell me, Harry

1406
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:56,830
would you like to see your mother and father again?

1407
02:17:57,070 --> 02:17:59,150
Together

1408
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:01,910
we can bring them back.

1409
02:18:02,310 --> 02:18:07,030
All I ask is for something in return.

1410
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:16,870
That's it, Harry.

1411
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:21,630
There is no good and evil.

1412
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:24,870
There is only power

1413
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:29,190
and those too weak to seek it.

1414
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:34,910
Together, we'll do extraordinary things.

1415
02:18:35,310 --> 02:18:38,420
Just give me the Stone!

1416
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:41,350
You liar!

1417
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:43,710
Kill him!

1418
02:19:07,230 --> 02:19:09,090
What is this magic?

1419
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:12,550
Fool, get the Stone!

1420
02:20:57,830 --> 02:21:00,350
Good afternoon, Harry.

1421
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:06,990
- Tokens from your admirers? - Admirers?

1422
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:09,480
What happened in the dungeons

1423
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:13,190
between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

1424
02:21:13,390 --> 02:21:18,190
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1425
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:24,150
I see that your friend Ronald has saved you

1426
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:27,190
the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1427
02:21:27,390 --> 02:21:30,430
Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?

1428
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:35,510
Fine. They're both just fine.

1429
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:38,870
- What happened to the Stone? - Relax, dear boy.

1430
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:42,030
The Stone has been destroyed.

1431
02:21:42,310 --> 02:21:46,510
My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat

1432
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:50,670
and agreed it was best all around.

1433
02:21:50,910 --> 02:21:54,710
But then, Flamel, he'll die, won't he?

1434
02:21:57,390 --> 02:22:02,270
He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order.

1435
02:22:02,470 --> 02:22:05,710
But yes, he will die.

1436
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:08,350
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1437
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:11,110
One minute I was staring in the mirror and...

1438
02:22:11,310 --> 02:22:15,430
You see, only a person

1439
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:19,630
who wanted to find the Stone, find it

1440
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:24,430
but not use it, would be able to get it.

1441
02:22:25,390 --> 02:22:28,870
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1442
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:33,950
And between you and me, that is saying something.

1443
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:38,250
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,

1444
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:40,830
that Voldemort can never come back?

1445
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:43,350
I'm afraid

1446
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:48,830
there are ways in which he can return.

1447
02:22:49,550 --> 02:22:52,110
Harry, do you know why

1448
02:22:52,310 --> 02:22:56,350
Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?

1449
02:22:56,550 --> 02:23:01,190
It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you.

1450
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:04,910
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1451
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:08,910
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1452
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:14,070
- It lives in your very skin. - What is it?

1453
02:23:14,910 --> 02:23:18,630
Love, Harry. Love.

1454
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:30,830
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1455
02:23:31,030 --> 02:23:32,700
I was most unfortunate in my youth

1456
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:35,710
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1457
02:23:35,950 --> 02:23:39,230
And since then, I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them.

1458
02:23:39,470 --> 02:23:42,830
But I think I could be safe

1459
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:45,430
with a nice toffee.

1460
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:51,070
Alas!

1461
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:53,870
Earwax.

1462
02:24:09,110 --> 02:24:12,270
- All right there, Ron? - All right. You?

1463
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:16,110
All right. Hermione?

1464
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:18,630
Never better.

1465
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:36,870
Another year gone.

1466
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:42,190
And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding.

1467
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:45,030
And the points stand thus:

1468
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:50,530
In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points.

1469
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:58,670
Third place, Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1470
02:25:03,950 --> 02:25:05,750
In second place

1471
02:25:05,950 --> 02:25:10,750
Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1472
02:25:16,430 --> 02:25:18,150
And in first place

1473
02:25:18,470 --> 02:25:23,310
with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1474
02:25:29,470 --> 02:25:31,710
Nice one, mate.

1475
02:25:35,550 --> 02:25:39,630
Yes, well done, Slytherin. Well done.

1476
02:25:39,870 --> 02:25:44,150
However, recent events must be taken into account.

1477
02:25:44,390 --> 02:25:49,350
And I have a few last-minute points to award.

1478
02:25:49,950 --> 02:25:52,410
To Miss Hermione Granger,

1479
02:25:52,410 --> 02:25:55,470
for the cool use of intellect

1480
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:58,470
while others were in grave peril

1481
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:01,430
50 points.

1482
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:03,630
Good job.

1483
02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:14,100
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,

1484
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:17,390
for the best-played game of chess

1485
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:21,220
that Hogwarts has seen these many years,

1486
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:23,150
50 points.

1487
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:29,830
And third

1488
02:26:30,390 --> 02:26:33,270
to Mr. Harry Potter

1489
02:26:33,470 --> 02:26:37,750
for pure nerve and outstanding courage

1490
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:43,230
I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1491
02:26:51,510 --> 02:26:53,430
We're tied with Slytherin!

1492
02:26:53,670 --> 02:26:55,780
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery

1493
02:26:55,790 --> 02:26:59,670
to stand up to your enemies

1494
02:26:59,870 --> 02:27:01,810
but a great deal more

1495
02:27:01,810 --> 02:27:03,750
to stand up to your friends.

1496
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:06,910
I award 10 points

1497
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:10,350
to Neville Longbottom.

1498
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:27,110
Assuming that my calculations are correct

1499
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:31,870
I believe that a change of decoration is in order.

1500
02:27:36,910 --> 02:27:40,270
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1501
02:28:18,310 --> 02:28:21,670
Come on, now. Hurry up, you'll be late.

1502
02:28:21,870 --> 02:28:26,150
Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry up.

1503
02:28:31,590 --> 02:28:34,870
- Come on, Harry. - One minute.

1504
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:44,870
Thought you were leaving without saying goodbye, did you?

1505
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:49,950
This is for you.

1506
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:08,830
Thanks, Hagrid.

1507
02:29:14,670 --> 02:29:19,070
Go on. On with you. On with you now. Oh, listen, Harry.

1508
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:23,950
If that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief

1509
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:26,870
you could always threaten him

1510
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:29,990
with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.

1511
02:29:30,190 --> 02:29:32,010
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic

1512
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:35,270
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1513
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:40,070
I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Right?

1514
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:48,710
Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

1515
02:29:48,910 --> 02:29:50,990
I'm not going home.

1516
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:53,110
Not really.
