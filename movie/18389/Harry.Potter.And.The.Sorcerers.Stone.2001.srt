6
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,943
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

7
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,361
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

8
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,862
Are the rumors true, Albus?

9
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:52,340
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

10
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,776
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

11
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,918
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

12
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,356
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

13
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:28,307
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

14
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,416
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

15
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:37,055
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

16
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,381
Try not to wake him.

17
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:43,185
There you go.

18
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:53,230
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

19
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:58,671
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

20
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:02,903
- They really are--
- The only family he has.

21
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:08,075
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

22
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,016
Exactly.

23
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:14,488
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

24
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,690
Until he's ready.

25
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:37,237
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

26
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:50,620
Good luck...

27
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,787
...Harry Potter.

28
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,318
Up. Get up!

29
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:18,479
Now!

30
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,535
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

31
00:04:46,717 --> 00:04:51,983
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

32
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:56,986
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

33
00:04:57,194 --> 00:05:02,154
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

34
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:05,335
...for my Dudley's special day!

35
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:10,495
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

36
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:14,839
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

37
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:20,508
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

38
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:23,914
36?! But last year I had 37!

39
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,022
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

40
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,749
This is what we're going to do.

41
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:35,296
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

42
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,863
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

43
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,074
I'm warning you now, boy.

44
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:51,939
Any funny business, any at all...

45
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,242
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

46
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,514
Get in.

47
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:07,128
Make it move.

48
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:11,528
Move!

49
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:14,226
- Move!
- He's asleep!

50
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,962
He's boring.

51
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:20,876
Sorry about him.

52
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:24,807
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

53
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:29,182
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

54
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:34,617
Can you hear me?

55
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,120
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

56
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:43,030
Do you...?

57
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:47,329
Do you talk to people often?

58
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:51,771
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

59
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:54,307
Do you miss your family?

60
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:01,879
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

61
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:07,045
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

62
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:32,170
Thanks.

63
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:33,848
Anytime.

64
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,086
Snake!

65
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:57,902
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

66
00:07:58,106 --> 00:08:01,234
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

67
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:06,874
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

68
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:16,988
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

69
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:21,729
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

70
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,798
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

71
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:33,105
There's no such thing as magic.

72
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,438
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

73
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:15,912
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

74
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:18,847
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

75
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,679
No more mail through this letterbox.

76
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:09,630
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

77
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:15,235
Shoo! Go on.

78
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,933
Fine day, Sunday.

79
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:48,266
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

80
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:52,912
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

81
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:55,843
No post on Sunday.

82
00:10:57,284 --> 00:11:01,186
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

83
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:06,748
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

84
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:19,036
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

85
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,779
Make it stop, please!

86
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,487
Stop it!

87
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,551
Mummy, what's happening?

88
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,333
Give me that! Give me that letter!

89
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,703
Get off!

90
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:03,644
They're my letters! Let go of me!

91
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,442
That's it! We're going away!

92
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:11,816
Far away, where they can't find us!

93
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,289
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

94
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:52,460
Make a wish, Harry.

95
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,604
Who's there?

96
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,228
Sorry about that.

97
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:36,699
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

98
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,411
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

99
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,110
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

100
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:55,850
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

101
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,893
I'm not Harry.

102
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:04,462
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

103
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:06,864
Got something for you.

104
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:12,599
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

105
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,547
Baked it myself, words and all.

106
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,111
Thank you.

107
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:29,483
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

108
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,838
Excuse me, but who are you?

109
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:53,982
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

110
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,915
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

111
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:03,459
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

112
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,059
Learned what?

113
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:07,753
You're a wizard, Harry.

114
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,092
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

115
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:14,327
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

116
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,507
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

117
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,610
...I can't be a wizard.

118
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:26,044
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

119
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:31,144
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

120
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:35,950
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

121
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,537
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

122
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:58,975
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

123
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:04,141
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

124
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:08,586
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

125
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,885
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

126
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:15,825
My perfect sister being who she was.

127
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:21,970
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

128
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:26,336
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

129
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:30,205
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

130
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,141
A freak!

131
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:35,977
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

132
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:41,282
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

133
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,518
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

134
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:50,722
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

135
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:55,267
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

136
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:59,338
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

137
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,066
He'll not be going.

138
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:05,576
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

139
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:06,770
Muggle?

140
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:11,143
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

141
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:15,254
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

142
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:21,327
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

143
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,365
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

144
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:31,129
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

145
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,364
...in front of me.

146
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:56,527
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

147
00:17:56,732 --> 00:18:00,827
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

148
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,105
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

149
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:14,543
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

150
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:32,093
"All students must be equipped with...

151
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,269
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

152
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,272
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

153
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:44,104
Can we find all this in London?

154
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:46,677
If you know where to go.

155
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:12,439
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

156
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,542
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

157
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:19,803
Just helping Harry
buy his school supplies.

158
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:23,608
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

159
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:31,347
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

160
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,858
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

161
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:41,629
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

162
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:44,326
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

163
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:49,601
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

164
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,244
Oh, nice to meet you.

165
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:55,539
Fearfully fascinating subject.

166
00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:00,379
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

167
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:05,484
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

168
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:07,455
Goodbye.

169
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,759
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

170
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:17,403
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

171
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:21,437
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

172
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,190
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

173
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,035
Here, you get your quills and ink.

174
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:05,206
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

175
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:32,305
It's a world-class racing broom.

176
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:36,412
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

177
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:39,914
It's the fastest model yet.

178
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:48,219
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

179
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:51,884
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

180
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:57,501
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

181
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:14,173
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

182
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:19,688
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

183
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:21,792
Best stay close.

184
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,527
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

185
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:36,935
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

186
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,106
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

187
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:46,781
Ha! There's the little devil.

188
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:49,818
And there's something else as well.

189
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:54,455
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

190
00:22:58,496 --> 00:23:03,559
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

191
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:06,837
Very well.

192
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:14,877
Vault 687.

193
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:19,079
Lamp, please.

194
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:28,956
Key, please.

195
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:56,375
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

196
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:01,153
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

197
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:05,522
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

198
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:07,287
Stand back.

199
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:38,390
Best not to mention this to anyone.

200
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,729
I still need a wand.

201
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:55,105
A wand? You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

202
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,112
Run along there and wait. I got one more
thing to do. Won't be long.

203
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:19,965
Hello?

204
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,804
Hello?

205
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,610
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

206
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:42,620
It seems only yesterday...

207
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:48,695
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

208
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,635
Here we are.

209
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:08,773
Give it a wave.

210
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,817
Apparently not.

211
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:27,464
Perhaps...

212
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,298
...this.

213
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,944
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

214
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,783
I wonder....

215
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,387
Curious.

216
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:26,526
Very curious.

217
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,856
Sorry, but what's curious?

218
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:34,866
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

219
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,799
It so happens that the phoenix...

220
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:42,670
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

221
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:46,238
Just one other.

222
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:50,780
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

223
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:56,719
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

224
00:27:58,526 --> 00:28:01,723
And who owned that wand?

225
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:04,962
We do not speak his name.

226
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:08,957
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

227
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:12,139
It's not always clear why.

228
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,998
But I think it is clear...

229
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,145
...that we can expect
great things from you.

230
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:24,647
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

231
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:27,479
...did great things.

232
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:29,680
Terrible...

233
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:33,456
...yes, but great.

234
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:41,057
Harry! Harry!

235
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:43,867
Happy birthday.

236
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:54,503
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

237
00:28:54,848 --> 00:29:00,480
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

238
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:04,248
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

239
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:12,757
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

240
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,457
Not all wizards are good.

241
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,194
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

242
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:23,398
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

243
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:27,273
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

244
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,346
No, I can't spell it.

245
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:33,781
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

246
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:40,021
It was dark times, Harry.

247
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:45,423
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

248
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:48,999
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

249
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:53,531
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

250
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,700
Your parents fought against him.

251
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,642
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

252
00:30:06,086 --> 00:30:08,610
Nobody, not one.

253
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:11,221
Except you.

254
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:17,389
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

255
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,028
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

256
00:30:22,268 --> 00:30:28,070
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

257
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:31,835
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

258
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:36,413
Well, some say he died.

259
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,981
Codswallop, in my opinion.

260
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:42,484
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

261
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,657
...too tired to carry on.

262
00:30:45,858 --> 00:30:51,296
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

263
00:30:51,497 --> 00:30:55,762
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

264
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:59,897
You're the boy who lived.

265
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,978
What are you looking at?

266
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,686
Blimey, is that the time?

267
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:19,949
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

268
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,993
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

269
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:30,566
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

270
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:35,736
"Platform 9 3/4"?

271
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:40,741
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

272
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:44,278
There's no such thing, is there?

273
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:04,325
Sorry.

274
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:08,601
Excuse me. Excuse me.

275
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:10,363
On your left.

276
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:14,409
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

277
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:17,172
Think you're being funny, do you?

278
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:20,715
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

279
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,520
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

280
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:33,391
All right, Percy, you first.

281
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,602
Fred, you next.

282
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:48,439
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

283
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:50,614
I'm sorry, George.

284
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,219
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

285
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:05,587
Excuse me.

286
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:09,497
Could you tell me how to...?

287
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:13,227
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

288
00:33:13,437 --> 00:33:15,905
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

289
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:22,011
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

290
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:25,638
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

291
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,574
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

292
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:29,973
Not at all.

293
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:35,483
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

294
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:38,347
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

295
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:41,749
So it's true!

296
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:44,755
I mean, do you really have the...?

297
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:48,228
- The what?
- The scar?

298
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,597
Wicked!

299
00:34:56,072 --> 00:35:01,237
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

300
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:07,579
We'll take the lot.

301
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,095
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

302
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:26,902
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

303
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:30,971
...spinach, liver and tripe.

304
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:35,268
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

305
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:45,316
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

306
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:50,981
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

307
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,758
Watch it!

308
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:00,599
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

309
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:07,340
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

310
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:10,668
Hey, he's gone!

311
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:14,338
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

312
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:18,111
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

313
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:19,480
A little.

314
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:23,054
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

315
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:25,249
Yeah.

316
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:33,660
Has anyone seen a toad?

317
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:36,662
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

318
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:41,639
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

319
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:47,011
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

320
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:50,342
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

321
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:58,684
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

322
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:02,192
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

323
00:37:02,397 --> 00:37:05,024
...but they've all worked for me.

324
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,695
For example:

325
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,869
Oculus Reparo.

326
00:37:15,977 --> 00:37:18,571
That's better, isn't it?

327
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,682
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

328
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:27,480
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

329
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:31,386
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

330
00:37:31,593 --> 00:37:36,689
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

331
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:44,270
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

332
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,463
Just there.

333
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:02,585
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

334
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:08,022
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

335
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:17,994
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

336
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:23,406
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

337
00:39:09,088 --> 00:39:10,885
Wicked.

338
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,316
Welcome to Hogwarts.

339
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,479
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

340
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:50,788
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

341
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:54,124
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

342
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:58,770
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

343
00:39:59,205 --> 00:40:04,199
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

344
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:08,369
Your triumphs will earn you points.

345
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:12,710
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

346
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:18,220
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

347
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:19,753
Trevor!

348
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,292
Sorry.

349
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:34,439
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

350
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:39,176
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

351
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:42,206
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

352
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:43,779
Harry Potter?

353
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:47,145
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

354
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:49,650
And I'm Malfoy.

355
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:52,253
Draco Malfoy.

356
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:57,888
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

357
00:40:58,063 --> 00:41:03,797
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

358
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:08,796
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

359
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:12,773
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

360
00:41:12,977 --> 00:41:15,172
I can help you there.

361
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:21,215
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

362
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,086
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

363
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,173
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

364
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:55,419
I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

365
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:11,499
Will you wait along here, please?

366
00:42:12,937 --> 00:42:15,700
Now, before we begin...

367
00:42:15,873 --> 00:42:19,172
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

368
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:24,176
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

369
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:26,676
The first years, please note...

370
00:42:26,951 --> 00:42:32,980
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

371
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:38,753
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

372
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:43,525
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

373
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:48,100
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

374
00:42:49,473 --> 00:42:51,407
Thank you.

375
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:57,273
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

376
00:42:57,481 --> 00:43:01,075
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

377
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:04,516
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

378
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:07,349
Hermione Granger.

379
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,222
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

380
00:43:12,596 --> 00:43:15,962
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

381
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,271
Right, then. Right.

382
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:29,137
Okay. Gryffindor!

383
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:40,721
Draco Malfoy.

384
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:47,492
Slytherin!

385
00:43:48,397 --> 00:43:51,366
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

386
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:54,092
Susan Bones.

387
00:44:02,678 --> 00:44:04,771
Harry, what is it?

388
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:07,745
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

389
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,417
Let's see....

390
00:44:09,652 --> 00:44:13,986
I know! Hufflepuff!

391
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:18,192
Ronald Weasley.

392
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:37,037
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

393
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:40,045
Gryffindor!

394
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:48,722
Harry Potter.

395
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:09,801
Difficult, very difficult.

396
00:45:09,978 --> 00:45:13,972
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

397
00:45:14,183 --> 00:45:16,481
There's talent, oh, yes.

398
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:20,519
And a thirst to prove yourself.

399
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:22,883
But where to put you?

400
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:25,982
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

401
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:29,857
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

402
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:34,968
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

403
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:40,506
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

404
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:45,473
No? Well, if you're sure.

405
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,443
Better be...

406
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:49,617
...Gryffindor!

407
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:17,907
Your attention, please.

408
00:46:19,948 --> 00:46:22,643
Let the feast begin.

409
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,158
I'm half and half.

410
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:44,566
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

411
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:48,300
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

412
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:53,109
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

413
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:56,575
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

414
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:58,718
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

415
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:04,517
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

416
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:11,361
Hello! How are you?

417
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:14,966
Welcome to Gryffindor.

418
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:27,503
It's the Bloody Baron!

419
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,983
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

420
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:40,627
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

421
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:46,633
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

422
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,530
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

423
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:53,228
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

424
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,507
Like this.

425
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:09,419
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

426
00:48:09,622 --> 00:48:13,956
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

427
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,527
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

428
00:48:17,698 --> 00:48:21,930
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

429
00:48:31,043 --> 00:48:36,846
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

430
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,712
That picture's moving.

431
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:43,377
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

432
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:47,523
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

433
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:50,218
Welcome to Hogwarts.

434
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:07,872
Password?

435
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:11,147
Caput Draconis.

436
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:22,759
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

437
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:27,897
Gather around here.

438
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:32,902
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

439
00:49:33,105 --> 00:49:37,508
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

440
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,804
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

441
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,672
Made it!

442
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:55,512
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

443
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:03,515
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

444
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:08,028
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

445
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,430
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

446
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:17,437
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

447
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:31,282
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

448
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:35,117
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

449
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:39,091
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

450
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:42,358
However, for those select few...

451
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,634
...who possess the predisposition...

452
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,607
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

453
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,746
...and ensnare the senses.

454
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:59,474
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

455
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:05,555
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

456
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:15,957
Then again, maybe some of you have come
to Hogwarts in possession of abilities...

457
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,660
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

458
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:23,273
...to not pay attention.

459
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,407
Mr. Potter.

460
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:37,450
Our new celebrity.

461
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:45,425
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

462
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:51,098
You don't know? Let's try again.

463
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,896
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

464
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,607
I don't know, sir.

465
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,743
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

466
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,512
I don't know, sir.

467
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:10,245
Pity.

468
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:15,786
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

469
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,357
...is it, Mr. Potter?

470
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:27,127
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

471
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,929
Eye of rabbit....

472
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,935
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

473
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:37,909
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

474
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:46,521
Mail's here.

475
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:21,755
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

476
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:27,924
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

477
00:54:28,129 --> 00:54:33,568
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

478
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:37,302
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

479
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:41,007
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

480
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:44,906
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

481
00:54:45,113 --> 00:54:50,882
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

482
00:54:51,086 --> 00:54:56,820
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

483
00:54:57,025 --> 00:55:01,257
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

484
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:13,937
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

485
00:55:14,142 --> 00:55:16,940
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

486
00:55:18,246 --> 00:55:20,714
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

487
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:24,851
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

488
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:30,650
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

489
00:55:30,859 --> 00:55:32,793
Up!

490
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:33,983
Up.

491
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:37,293
Up.

492
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:40,625
Up. Up!

493
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,825
With feeling.

494
00:55:51,513 --> 00:55:53,639
Shut up, Harry.

495
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:58,546
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

496
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:02,712
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

497
00:56:03,124 --> 00:56:08,084
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

498
00:56:08,295 --> 00:56:12,129
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

499
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:16,633
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

500
00:56:16,837 --> 00:56:19,965
On my whistle. Three, two....

501
00:56:22,444 --> 00:56:23,808
Mr. Longbottom.

502
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,316
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

503
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:32,746
Neville!

504
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,151
Come back down this instant!

505
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:10,521
Everyone out of the way!

506
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:18,224
Is he all right?

507
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:24,299
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

508
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:30,235
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

509
00:57:30,443 --> 00:57:34,106
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

510
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:39,581
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

511
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:41,720
Did you see his face?

512
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:45,789
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

513
00:57:45,992 --> 00:57:48,483
Give it here, Malfoy.

514
00:57:49,328 --> 00:57:53,025
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

515
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,638
How about on the roof?

516
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,674
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

517
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:11,014
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

518
00:58:11,217 --> 00:58:14,084
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

519
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,354
What an idiot.

520
00:58:19,692 --> 00:58:23,184
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

521
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:25,489
Is that so?

522
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,966
Have it your way, then.

523
00:59:03,668 --> 00:59:07,331
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

524
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:09,599
Harry Potter!

525
00:59:10,543 --> 00:59:12,568
Follow me.

526
00:59:24,222 --> 00:59:26,486
You wait here.

527
00:59:28,261 --> 00:59:33,562
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

528
00:59:33,765 --> 00:59:35,596
Yes, of course.

529
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:46,974
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

530
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:52,606
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

531
00:59:52,817 --> 00:59:55,047
I always knew he'd do well.

532
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,581
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

533
00:59:59,758 --> 01:00:04,286
- You must be the youngest player in--
- A century, McGonagall says.

534
01:00:04,496 --> 01:00:07,090
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

535
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:09,824
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

536
01:00:10,035 --> 01:00:13,732
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

537
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:16,634
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

538
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:20,766
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

539
01:00:20,978 --> 01:00:23,743
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

540
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:29,649
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

541
01:00:29,854 --> 01:00:33,050
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

542
01:00:33,424 --> 01:00:38,259
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

543
01:00:46,837 --> 01:00:50,637
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

544
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:53,636
I didn't know.

545
01:00:58,215 --> 01:01:02,743
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

546
01:01:02,953 --> 01:01:05,285
Who doesn't?

547
01:01:06,223 --> 01:01:08,316
What's happening?

548
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,757
The staircases change, remember?

549
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:22,662
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

550
01:01:30,314 --> 01:01:33,749
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

551
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,077
We're not supposed to be here.

552
01:01:36,286 --> 01:01:40,223
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

553
01:01:41,425 --> 01:01:42,983
Let's go.

554
01:01:45,195 --> 01:01:48,096
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

555
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:55,304
Quick, let's hide through that door!

556
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:02,404
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

557
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:04,773
Move over!

558
01:02:05,715 --> 01:02:07,842
Alohomora.

559
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:10,651
Get in.

560
01:02:11,888 --> 01:02:13,014
Alohomora?

561
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:15,715
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

562
01:02:15,926 --> 01:02:19,327
Anyone here, my sweet?

563
01:02:25,568 --> 01:02:26,557
Come on.

564
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,938
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

565
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:33,769
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

566
01:02:59,435 --> 01:03:04,964
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

567
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:08,802
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

568
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:13,209
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

569
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:16,283
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

570
01:03:16,486 --> 01:03:20,149
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

571
01:03:20,356 --> 01:03:23,916
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

572
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:28,126
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

573
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:31,926
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

574
01:03:32,135 --> 01:03:35,263
Or worse, expelled.

575
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,772
She needs to sort out her priorities.

576
01:03:47,383 --> 01:03:51,581
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

577
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:57,555
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

578
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:06,762
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

579
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:12,929
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

580
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:17,510
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

581
01:04:17,712 --> 01:04:22,206
I think so. What are those?

582
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,647
You better take this.

583
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:39,461
Careful now, it's coming back.

584
01:04:46,107 --> 01:04:49,702
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

585
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,659
What was that?

586
01:05:09,431 --> 01:05:13,161
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

587
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:16,859
But you are a Seeker.

588
01:05:20,442 --> 01:05:25,037
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

589
01:05:25,246 --> 01:05:27,806
The Golden Snitch.

590
01:05:28,015 --> 01:05:31,007
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

591
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:35,245
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

592
01:05:35,456 --> 01:05:37,390
What do I do with it?

593
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:40,856
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

594
01:05:41,061 --> 01:05:43,552
You catch this, the game's over.

595
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:47,723
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

596
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:02,146
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

597
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:06,308
...or the ability to make objects fly.

598
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,920
Do you have your feathers? Good.

599
01:06:09,123 --> 01:06:14,253
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

600
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:18,192
The swish and flick. Everyone.

601
01:06:18,399 --> 01:06:23,996
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

602
01:06:24,705 --> 01:06:28,970
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

603
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:32,567
Wingardium Leviosa.

604
01:06:32,812 --> 01:06:35,111
Wingardium Leviosa.

605
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:43,251
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

606
01:06:43,456 --> 01:06:49,452
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

607
01:06:49,996 --> 01:06:54,263
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

608
01:06:55,536 --> 01:06:58,595
Wingardium Leviosa.

609
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:11,710
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

610
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:13,613
Splendid!

611
01:07:15,188 --> 01:07:17,349
Well done, dear.

612
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:25,689
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

613
01:07:32,205 --> 01:07:36,471
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

614
01:07:36,676 --> 01:07:42,012
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

615
01:07:42,749 --> 01:07:45,216
I think she heard you.

616
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:16,005
Where's Hermione?

617
01:08:16,214 --> 01:08:19,342
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

618
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:23,612
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

619
01:08:28,027 --> 01:08:31,723
Troll in the dungeon!

620
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:35,263
Troll in the dungeon!

621
01:08:38,103 --> 01:08:40,401
Thought you ought to know.

622
01:08:47,345 --> 01:08:50,143
Silence!

623
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:55,778
Everyone will please not panic!

624
01:08:56,488 --> 01:08:58,046
Now...

625
01:08:58,256 --> 01:09:02,817
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

626
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:08,331
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

627
01:09:19,376 --> 01:09:22,540
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

628
01:09:22,748 --> 01:09:24,511
How could a troll get in?

629
01:09:24,716 --> 01:09:29,881
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

630
01:09:30,088 --> 01:09:34,080
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

631
01:09:46,138 --> 01:09:49,402
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

632
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:55,438
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

633
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,842
Hermione, move!

634
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:36,462
Help! Help!

635
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:40,529
Hey, pea brain!

636
01:10:52,914 --> 01:10:54,814
Help!

637
01:11:15,965 --> 01:11:18,297
Do something!

638
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:23,726
- What?
- Anything!

639
01:11:24,337 --> 01:11:26,805
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

640
01:11:27,007 --> 01:11:29,271
Wingardium Leviosa.

641
01:11:40,249 --> 01:11:42,240
Cool.

642
01:12:06,637 --> 01:12:09,468
Is it dead?

643
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:13,607
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

644
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,212
Troll boogers.

645
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:28,244
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

646
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:33,048
- Well, what it is--
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

647
01:12:35,258 --> 01:12:36,452
Miss Granger?

648
01:12:37,327 --> 01:12:42,422
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

649
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,530
But I was wrong.

650
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:49,725
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

651
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:55,196
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

652
01:12:55,406 --> 01:13:01,038
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

653
01:13:01,245 --> 01:13:04,270
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

654
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:08,041
...for your serious lack of judgment.

655
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,507
As for you two gentlemen...

656
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,154
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

657
01:13:14,355 --> 01:13:17,791
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

658
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:20,619
...and live to tell the tale.

659
01:13:20,827 --> 01:13:23,295
Five points...

660
01:13:24,662 --> 01:13:27,790
...will be awarded to each of you...

661
01:13:29,366 --> 01:13:32,392
...for sheer dumb luck.

662
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,735
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

663
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:52,396
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

664
01:13:52,602 --> 01:13:55,832
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

665
01:13:56,038 --> 01:13:58,232
I'm not hungry.

666
01:13:58,806 --> 01:14:01,402
Good luck today, Potter.

667
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,500
You've proven yourself against a troll.

668
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:08,189
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

669
01:14:08,395 --> 01:14:11,455
Even if it is against Slytherin.

670
01:14:19,207 --> 01:14:22,607
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

671
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:27,173
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

672
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:29,975
...so he could get past that dog.

673
01:14:30,183 --> 01:14:32,981
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

674
01:14:33,186 --> 01:14:35,916
But why would anyone go near that dog?

675
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:39,355
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

676
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,824
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

677
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,189
You're saying--

678
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:48,834
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

679
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:05,974
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

680
01:15:06,486 --> 01:15:08,043
Let's open it.

681
01:15:18,197 --> 01:15:19,494
It's a broomstick.

682
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:24,430
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

683
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:27,931
But who--?

684
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:52,088
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

685
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,960
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

686
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:59,602
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

687
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:02,599
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

688
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:05,675
Woke up in hospital a week later.

689
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:31,232
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

690
01:16:31,435 --> 01:16:36,099
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

691
01:17:06,435 --> 01:17:08,869
The players take their positions...

692
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:12,872
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

693
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:16,443
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

694
01:17:17,013 --> 01:17:19,481
...from all of you!

695
01:17:24,621 --> 01:17:27,522
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

696
01:17:27,724 --> 01:17:30,453
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

697
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:34,459
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

698
01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:45,097
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

699
01:18:03,426 --> 01:18:08,159
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

700
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,667
Well done!

701
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:24,707
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

702
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,611
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

703
01:19:13,395 --> 01:19:15,261
Give me that!

704
01:19:46,728 --> 01:19:49,322
Take that side!

705
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:42,042
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

706
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:53,219
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

707
01:20:53,425 --> 01:20:57,794
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

708
01:21:19,552 --> 01:21:21,042
Come on, Hermione!

709
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,931
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

710
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:49,037
Fire! You're on fire!

711
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:09,058
Go, go, go, go!

712
01:23:01,085 --> 01:23:03,450
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

713
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,011
He's got the Snitch!

714
01:23:06,222 --> 01:23:10,251
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

715
01:23:10,462 --> 01:23:12,157
Gryffindor wins!

716
01:23:55,772 --> 01:24:00,003
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

717
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:04,145
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

718
01:24:04,346 --> 01:24:06,747
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

719
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:10,647
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

720
01:24:10,853 --> 01:24:16,153
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

721
01:24:16,357 --> 01:24:20,920
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

722
01:24:21,531 --> 01:24:25,523
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

723
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:29,192
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

724
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:34,802
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

725
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:38,604
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

726
01:24:38,813 --> 01:24:41,009
Exactly.

727
01:24:41,717 --> 01:24:44,481
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

728
01:24:44,686 --> 01:24:49,315
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

729
01:24:49,523 --> 01:24:54,620
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

730
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:56,262
Nicholas Flamel?

731
01:24:57,265 --> 01:25:01,929
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

732
01:25:02,136 --> 01:25:06,300
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

733
01:25:06,507 --> 01:25:08,475
I don't know.

734
01:25:27,327 --> 01:25:30,161
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

735
01:25:30,364 --> 01:25:33,196
Ring the Hogwart bell

736
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,164
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

737
01:25:36,369 --> 01:25:39,338
Cast a Christmas spell

738
01:25:52,951 --> 01:25:56,285
Knight to E-5.

739
01:26:03,962 --> 01:26:06,123
Queen to E-5.

740
01:26:11,738 --> 01:26:13,569
That's totally barbaric!

741
01:26:13,773 --> 01:26:17,334
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

742
01:26:17,544 --> 01:26:18,976
I see you haven't.

743
01:26:19,345 --> 01:26:24,510
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

744
01:26:24,717 --> 01:26:28,517
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

745
01:26:28,721 --> 01:26:32,158
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

746
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:35,815
We've looked a hundred times!

747
01:26:36,494 --> 01:26:41,728
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

748
01:26:43,969 --> 01:26:46,869
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

749
01:26:49,374 --> 01:26:53,744
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

750
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:06,921
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

751
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,321
What are you wearing?

752
01:27:09,962 --> 01:27:13,624
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

753
01:27:14,766 --> 01:27:17,200
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

754
01:27:24,608 --> 01:27:26,702
There they are.

755
01:27:37,722 --> 01:27:41,214
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

756
01:27:41,426 --> 01:27:45,557
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

757
01:28:02,414 --> 01:28:06,111
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

758
01:28:06,417 --> 01:28:09,352
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

759
01:28:14,724 --> 01:28:16,022
My body's gone!

760
01:28:16,227 --> 01:28:19,822
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

761
01:28:20,364 --> 01:28:22,263
I'm invisible?

762
01:28:22,766 --> 01:28:27,203
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

763
01:28:27,604 --> 01:28:32,440
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

764
01:29:00,504 --> 01:29:06,374
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

765
01:29:06,576 --> 01:29:12,377
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

766
01:29:31,267 --> 01:29:33,131
Who's there?

767
01:29:39,275 --> 01:29:44,906
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

768
01:29:52,321 --> 01:29:56,018
Who is it? Show yourself.

769
01:30:43,203 --> 01:30:44,601
Severus, I....

770
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:49,141
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

771
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:54,077
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

772
01:31:11,298 --> 01:31:14,528
We'll have another little chat soon.

773
01:31:14,734 --> 01:31:20,195
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

774
01:31:20,406 --> 01:31:24,867
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

775
01:31:25,412 --> 01:31:30,440
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

776
01:33:02,507 --> 01:33:04,372
Mum?

777
01:33:07,612 --> 01:33:09,637
Dad?

778
01:33:44,314 --> 01:33:49,308
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

779
01:33:51,155 --> 01:33:54,056
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

780
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:57,785
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

781
01:34:04,568 --> 01:34:08,833
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

782
01:34:10,274 --> 01:34:12,265
I only see us.

783
01:34:12,476 --> 01:34:15,844
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

784
01:34:16,047 --> 01:34:21,950
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

785
01:34:22,485 --> 01:34:24,817
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

786
01:34:25,021 --> 01:34:29,219
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

787
01:34:30,394 --> 01:34:32,827
I look good.

788
01:34:33,462 --> 01:34:37,296
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

789
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:42,459
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

790
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,721
Back again, Harry?

791
01:35:10,866 --> 01:35:13,358
I see that you,
like many before you...

792
01:35:13,536 --> 01:35:17,733
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

793
01:35:18,039 --> 01:35:22,202
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

794
01:35:23,544 --> 01:35:26,071
Let me give you a clue.

795
01:35:26,616 --> 01:35:28,776
The happiest man on earth...

796
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:32,351
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

797
01:35:32,554 --> 01:35:34,885
...exactly as he is.

798
01:35:35,089 --> 01:35:40,187
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

799
01:35:40,361 --> 01:35:43,058
Yes. And no.

800
01:35:44,099 --> 01:35:46,624
It shows us nothing more or less...

801
01:35:46,801 --> 01:35:52,760
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

802
01:35:52,973 --> 01:35:57,672
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

803
01:35:57,878 --> 01:36:01,781
...you see them standing beside you.

804
01:36:01,983 --> 01:36:04,450
But remember this, Harry.

805
01:36:04,652 --> 01:36:10,522
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

806
01:36:10,724 --> 01:36:12,783
...or truth.

807
01:36:13,827 --> 01:36:19,788
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

808
01:36:20,869 --> 01:36:25,032
That is why tomorrow,
it will be moved to a new home.

809
01:36:25,239 --> 01:36:27,173
And I must ask you...

810
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:32,010
...not to go looking for it again.

811
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,874
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

812
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:39,318
...and forget to live.

813
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:39,705
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

814
01:37:39,945 --> 01:37:43,039
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

815
01:37:43,248 --> 01:37:45,240
This is light?

816
01:37:49,956 --> 01:37:52,015
Of course! Here it is!

817
01:37:52,592 --> 01:37:56,493
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

818
01:37:56,695 --> 01:37:57,890
The what?

819
01:37:58,564 --> 01:38:01,556
Honestly, don't you two read?

820
01:38:01,768 --> 01:38:06,329
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

821
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:09,099
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

822
01:38:09,308 --> 01:38:13,301
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

823
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:15,742
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

824
01:38:15,914 --> 01:38:18,007
I know what it means!

825
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:23,617
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

826
01:38:23,822 --> 01:38:28,919
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

827
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:32,856
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

828
01:38:33,031 --> 01:38:37,764
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

829
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:58,386
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

830
01:38:58,556 --> 01:39:01,286
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

831
01:39:05,996 --> 01:39:11,128
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

832
01:39:11,302 --> 01:39:14,099
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

833
01:39:14,504 --> 01:39:18,964
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

834
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:20,098
What?

835
01:39:20,243 --> 01:39:23,544
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

836
01:39:23,949 --> 01:39:26,508
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

837
01:39:26,683 --> 01:39:30,585
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

838
01:39:30,753 --> 01:39:33,381
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

839
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:36,651
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

840
01:39:36,861 --> 01:39:38,919
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

841
01:39:39,195 --> 01:39:42,858
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

842
01:39:43,066 --> 01:39:46,661
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

843
01:40:00,517 --> 01:40:05,614
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's....

844
01:40:05,822 --> 01:40:07,881
I know what that is!

845
01:40:08,057 --> 01:40:10,719
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

846
01:40:11,027 --> 01:40:14,324
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

847
01:40:14,495 --> 01:40:18,627
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

848
01:40:40,856 --> 01:40:43,086
Is that...

849
01:40:43,859 --> 01:40:45,053
...a dragon?

850
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:49,662
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

851
01:40:49,864 --> 01:40:52,731
My brother works
with these in Romania.

852
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:57,838
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

853
01:40:58,474 --> 01:41:00,202
Hello, Norbert.

854
01:41:00,608 --> 01:41:04,874
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

855
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,071
Don't you, Norbert?

856
01:41:15,022 --> 01:41:18,185
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

857
01:41:22,029 --> 01:41:24,087
Who's that?

858
01:41:25,866 --> 01:41:27,959
Malfoy.

859
01:41:28,703 --> 01:41:30,102
Oh, dear.

860
01:41:31,772 --> 01:41:36,606
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

861
01:41:36,810 --> 01:41:40,872
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

862
01:41:41,048 --> 01:41:45,144
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

863
01:41:45,486 --> 01:41:47,612
Good evening.

864
01:41:51,258 --> 01:41:54,194
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

865
01:41:54,395 --> 01:41:57,990
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

866
01:41:58,165 --> 01:42:02,998
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

867
01:42:03,202 --> 01:42:05,568
- 50?!
- Each.

868
01:42:06,606 --> 01:42:09,008
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

869
01:42:09,177 --> 01:42:12,475
...all four of you
will receive detention.

870
01:42:13,447 --> 01:42:16,416
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

871
01:42:16,584 --> 01:42:19,017
I thought you said the four of us.

872
01:42:19,185 --> 01:42:21,620
No, you heard me correctly.

873
01:42:21,822 --> 01:42:26,849
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

874
01:42:27,361 --> 01:42:30,296
You will join your classmates
in detention.

875
01:42:41,508 --> 01:42:45,502
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

876
01:42:45,713 --> 01:42:50,445
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

877
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:53,483
God, I miss the screaming.

878
01:42:56,056 --> 01:42:59,354
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

879
01:42:59,525 --> 01:43:04,896
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

880
01:43:06,966 --> 01:43:09,901
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

881
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:16,364
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

882
01:43:18,644 --> 01:43:20,737
Norbert's gone.

883
01:43:21,213 --> 01:43:24,808
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

884
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:28,349
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

885
01:43:28,487 --> 01:43:30,888
What if he don't like Romania?

886
01:43:31,057 --> 01:43:35,321
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

887
01:43:35,927 --> 01:43:41,230
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

888
01:43:41,433 --> 01:43:43,799
Got to have your wits about you.

889
01:43:44,002 --> 01:43:49,667
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

890
01:43:50,074 --> 01:43:53,976
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

891
01:43:55,513 --> 01:43:56,741
...werewolves.

892
01:43:57,181 --> 01:44:00,447
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

893
01:44:00,652 --> 01:44:03,348
You can be sure of that.

894
01:44:05,323 --> 01:44:06,688
Nighty-night.

895
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:12,525
Right. Let's go.

896
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:52,766
Hagrid, what is that?

897
01:44:52,968 --> 01:44:56,371
What we're here for.
See that?

898
01:44:56,808 --> 01:45:02,245
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

899
01:45:02,779 --> 01:45:07,340
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

900
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:20,625
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

901
01:45:20,831 --> 01:45:23,924
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

902
01:45:24,433 --> 01:45:27,732
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

903
01:45:29,205 --> 01:45:31,299
Okay. Then I get Fang.

904
01:45:31,441 --> 01:45:37,175
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

905
01:45:40,883 --> 01:45:45,842
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

906
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:49,981
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

907
01:45:50,193 --> 01:45:53,094
I'm not scared, Potter.

908
01:45:53,929 --> 01:45:55,897
Do you hear that?

909
01:45:58,366 --> 01:45:59,833
Come on, Fang.

910
01:46:00,034 --> 01:46:01,467
Scared!

911
01:46:26,561 --> 01:46:28,756
What is it, Fang?

912
01:47:39,132 --> 01:47:44,627
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

913
01:47:44,838 --> 01:47:48,865
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

914
01:47:49,076 --> 01:47:51,806
What was that thing you saved me from?

915
01:47:51,979 --> 01:47:57,348
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

916
01:47:57,550 --> 01:48:03,114
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

917
01:48:03,323 --> 01:48:08,420
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

918
01:48:08,595 --> 01:48:13,497
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

919
01:48:13,666 --> 01:48:15,531
A cursed life.

920
01:48:15,701 --> 01:48:19,637
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

921
01:48:19,839 --> 01:48:24,800
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

922
01:48:25,145 --> 01:48:29,103
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

923
01:48:29,281 --> 01:48:34,445
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

924
01:48:35,287 --> 01:48:36,778
The Philosopher's Stone.

925
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:40,116
Harry!

926
01:48:40,694 --> 01:48:45,186
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

927
01:48:45,397 --> 01:48:47,524
You all right there, Harry?

928
01:48:48,733 --> 01:48:53,000
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

929
01:48:53,907 --> 01:48:57,740
You're safe now. Good luck.

930
01:49:05,217 --> 01:49:09,482
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

931
01:49:09,654 --> 01:49:12,522
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

932
01:49:12,692 --> 01:49:15,626
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

933
01:49:15,827 --> 01:49:20,196
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

934
01:49:20,398 --> 01:49:24,960
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

935
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:26,728
He'll come back.

936
01:49:26,905 --> 01:49:28,702
But if he comes back...

937
01:49:28,907 --> 01:49:32,900
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

938
01:49:33,912 --> 01:49:37,473
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

939
01:49:37,682 --> 01:49:41,277
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

940
01:49:41,453 --> 01:49:45,047
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

941
01:49:45,422 --> 01:49:50,258
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

942
01:49:51,062 --> 01:49:56,192
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

943
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:00,428
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

944
01:50:06,209 --> 01:50:11,614
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

945
01:50:11,815 --> 01:50:15,513
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

946
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:20,883
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

947
01:50:21,090 --> 01:50:23,786
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

948
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:27,431
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

949
01:50:35,104 --> 01:50:37,572
- Of course!
- What is it?

950
01:50:37,774 --> 01:50:41,574
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

951
01:50:41,744 --> 01:50:44,805
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

952
01:50:44,982 --> 01:50:47,745
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

953
01:50:47,917 --> 01:50:50,181
Why didn't I see it before?

954
01:50:55,758 --> 01:50:59,250
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

955
01:50:59,462 --> 01:51:02,261
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

956
01:51:02,432 --> 01:51:04,955
You and this stranger
must have talked.

957
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,196
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

958
01:51:09,372 --> 01:51:13,365
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

959
01:51:13,543 --> 01:51:18,002
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

960
01:51:18,445 --> 01:51:22,611
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

961
01:51:22,785 --> 01:51:28,451
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

962
01:51:28,657 --> 01:51:34,094
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

963
01:51:35,763 --> 01:51:38,494
I shouldn't have told you that.

964
01:51:38,667 --> 01:51:40,897
Where are you going?

965
01:51:47,876 --> 01:51:50,641
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

966
01:51:51,047 --> 01:51:53,708
I'm afraid he's not here.

967
01:51:53,915 --> 01:51:58,182
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

968
01:51:58,654 --> 01:52:01,623
He's gone?
But this is important!

969
01:52:01,824 --> 01:52:05,315
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

970
01:52:05,527 --> 01:52:09,293
- How do you know--?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

971
01:52:09,898 --> 01:52:15,131
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

972
01:52:15,337 --> 01:52:19,638
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

973
01:52:27,915 --> 01:52:30,748
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

974
01:52:30,918 --> 01:52:33,547
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

975
01:52:33,755 --> 01:52:37,657
- And with Dumbledore gone--
- Good afternoon.

976
01:52:39,694 --> 01:52:43,060
What would three young Gryffindors...

977
01:52:43,197 --> 01:52:47,965
...be doing inside on a day like this?

978
01:52:52,138 --> 01:52:55,631
- We were just--
- You ought to be careful.

979
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:58,201
People will think you're...

980
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:05,145
...up to something.

981
01:53:15,496 --> 01:53:17,464
Now what do we do?

982
01:53:17,665 --> 01:53:21,465
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

983
01:53:35,182 --> 01:53:36,672
Trevor.

984
01:53:36,984 --> 01:53:40,383
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

985
01:53:40,652 --> 01:53:46,114
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

986
01:53:46,292 --> 01:53:50,252
- Neville, listen. We were--
- No, I won't let you!

987
01:53:50,531 --> 01:53:55,092
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

988
01:53:55,301 --> 01:54:00,830
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

989
01:54:07,547 --> 01:54:11,381
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

990
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:15,246
Brilliant, but scary.

991
01:54:15,854 --> 01:54:17,981
Let's go.

992
01:54:18,156 --> 01:54:22,422
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

993
01:54:27,833 --> 01:54:31,792
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

994
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:37,666
Alohomora.

995
01:54:49,721 --> 01:54:52,246
Wait a minute. He's...

996
01:54:53,525 --> 01:54:55,287
...snoring.

997
01:54:58,195 --> 01:55:03,690
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

998
01:55:05,337 --> 01:55:08,329
It's got horrible breath.

999
01:55:10,875 --> 01:55:12,968
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

1000
01:55:13,177 --> 01:55:14,643
Come on!

1001
01:55:18,682 --> 01:55:20,742
Okay. Push.

1002
01:55:43,907 --> 01:55:47,537
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1003
01:55:47,711 --> 01:55:52,738
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1004
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:56,986
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1005
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,552
The harp.

1006
01:56:00,224 --> 01:56:02,919
It's stopped playing.

1007
01:56:13,234 --> 01:56:14,965
Jump!

1008
01:56:28,283 --> 01:56:31,912
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1009
01:56:46,336 --> 01:56:49,463
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1010
01:56:49,638 --> 01:56:53,370
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1011
01:56:53,543 --> 01:56:58,503
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1012
01:57:00,816 --> 01:57:02,147
Hermione!

1013
01:57:02,684 --> 01:57:06,518
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1014
01:57:06,722 --> 01:57:11,184
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1015
01:57:18,333 --> 01:57:21,666
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1016
01:57:21,870 --> 01:57:24,930
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1017
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:27,631
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1018
01:57:27,843 --> 01:57:30,812
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1019
01:57:31,647 --> 01:57:35,515
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1020
01:57:35,717 --> 01:57:40,086
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1021
01:57:40,355 --> 01:57:42,414
Lumus Solem.

1022
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:53,059
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1023
01:57:55,737 --> 01:57:58,228
Lucky we didn't panic.

1024
01:57:59,007 --> 01:58:02,497
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1025
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:05,636
What is that?

1026
01:58:05,847 --> 01:58:09,647
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1027
01:58:22,697 --> 01:58:26,155
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1028
01:58:26,367 --> 01:58:29,996
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1029
01:58:30,204 --> 01:58:33,662
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1030
01:58:37,143 --> 01:58:41,739
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1031
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:49,680
Strange.

1032
01:58:50,056 --> 01:58:52,388
Alohomora!

1033
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:57,627
Well, it was worth a try.

1034
01:58:57,831 --> 01:59:01,063
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1035
01:59:01,269 --> 01:59:05,204
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1036
01:59:05,405 --> 01:59:08,772
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1037
01:59:12,411 --> 01:59:14,744
What's wrong?

1038
01:59:15,615 --> 01:59:17,082
It's too simple.

1039
01:59:17,284 --> 01:59:22,119
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1040
01:59:22,289 --> 01:59:25,849
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1041
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:45,702
This complicates things a bit.

1042
02:00:06,964 --> 02:00:09,159
Catch the key!

1043
02:00:13,271 --> 02:00:15,206
Hurry up!

1044
02:00:47,671 --> 02:00:52,405
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1045
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:55,738
Where are we? A graveyard.

1046
02:00:56,114 --> 02:00:58,741
This is no graveyard.

1047
02:01:06,256 --> 02:01:09,192
It's a chessboard.

1048
02:01:21,139 --> 02:01:23,071
There's the door.

1049
02:01:35,153 --> 02:01:36,642
Now what do we do?

1050
02:01:36,953 --> 02:01:41,151
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1051
02:01:41,725 --> 02:01:45,455
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1052
02:01:45,828 --> 02:01:50,028
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1053
02:01:50,234 --> 02:01:54,329
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1054
02:02:01,478 --> 02:02:03,207
What happens now?

1055
02:02:03,947 --> 02:02:06,974
Well, white moves first.

1056
02:02:07,185 --> 02:02:09,048
And then...

1057
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:12,082
...we play.

1058
02:02:22,631 --> 02:02:27,728
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1059
02:02:27,938 --> 02:02:31,499
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1060
02:02:31,908 --> 02:02:34,842
You there, D-5.

1061
02:02:49,458 --> 02:02:51,016
Yes, Hermione.

1062
02:02:51,227 --> 02:02:56,289
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1063
02:03:02,204 --> 02:03:04,764
Castle to E-4!

1064
02:03:08,376 --> 02:03:10,401
Pawn to C-3!

1065
02:03:55,324 --> 02:03:59,315
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1066
02:03:59,526 --> 02:04:04,293
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1067
02:04:04,865 --> 02:04:07,266
Then you're free to check the king.

1068
02:04:07,467 --> 02:04:10,095
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1069
02:04:10,804 --> 02:04:15,468
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1070
02:04:15,676 --> 02:04:19,373
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1071
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:23,209
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1072
02:04:23,684 --> 02:04:26,482
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1073
02:04:36,730 --> 02:04:39,665
Knight to H-3.

1074
02:05:00,553 --> 02:05:02,544
Check.

1075
02:05:31,716 --> 02:05:33,513
Ron!

1076
02:05:33,718 --> 02:05:39,554
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1077
02:05:54,538 --> 02:05:55,869
Checkmate.

1078
02:06:15,826 --> 02:06:18,293
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1079
02:06:18,494 --> 02:06:22,363
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1080
02:06:22,566 --> 02:06:24,468
I have to go on.

1081
02:06:25,004 --> 02:06:30,907
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1082
02:06:31,108 --> 02:06:33,633
Not as good as you.

1083
02:06:34,478 --> 02:06:39,280
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1084
02:06:40,486 --> 02:06:46,150
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1085
02:07:24,228 --> 02:07:25,889
You?

1086
02:07:26,697 --> 02:07:30,496
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

1087
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:33,794
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1088
02:07:34,003 --> 02:07:37,098
Next to him, who would suspect...

1089
02:07:37,307 --> 02:07:41,242
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1090
02:07:41,444 --> 02:07:46,814
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1091
02:07:47,017 --> 02:07:49,849
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1092
02:07:50,353 --> 02:07:54,483
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1093
02:07:54,690 --> 02:07:56,920
...I would have succeeded.

1094
02:07:57,126 --> 02:08:00,152
Even with Snape muttering
his counter-curse.

1095
02:08:00,363 --> 02:08:02,525
Snape was trying to save me?

1096
02:08:02,733 --> 02:08:08,101
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1097
02:08:08,303 --> 02:08:12,570
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1098
02:08:12,775 --> 02:08:15,768
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1099
02:08:16,345 --> 02:08:21,281
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1100
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:25,742
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1101
02:08:26,721 --> 02:08:31,989
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1102
02:08:32,195 --> 02:08:36,255
I'm never alone. Never.

1103
02:08:36,464 --> 02:08:40,559
Now, what does this mirror do?

1104
02:08:42,102 --> 02:08:44,230
I see what I desire.

1105
02:08:44,806 --> 02:08:49,210
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1106
02:08:49,412 --> 02:08:51,538
Use the boy.

1107
02:08:52,379 --> 02:08:56,316
Come here, Potter! Now!

1108
02:09:08,362 --> 02:09:12,356
Tell me, what do you see?

1109
02:09:37,557 --> 02:09:39,991
What is it? What do you see?

1110
02:09:40,193 --> 02:09:45,359
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1111
02:09:45,566 --> 02:09:47,124
He lies.

1112
02:09:47,601 --> 02:09:51,297
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1113
02:09:51,503 --> 02:09:55,907
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1114
02:09:56,109 --> 02:10:00,170
I have strength enough for this.

1115
02:10:18,363 --> 02:10:21,198
Harry Potter...

1116
02:10:21,402 --> 02:10:23,801
...we meet again.

1117
02:10:24,003 --> 02:10:25,402
Voldemort.

1118
02:10:25,605 --> 02:10:29,540
Yes. You see what I've become?

1119
02:10:29,841 --> 02:10:33,403
See what I must do to survive?

1120
02:10:33,613 --> 02:10:37,743
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1121
02:10:38,417 --> 02:10:41,750
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1122
02:10:41,954 --> 02:10:45,617
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1123
02:10:45,824 --> 02:10:49,386
But there is something that can.

1124
02:10:49,595 --> 02:10:55,259
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1125
02:10:55,533 --> 02:10:57,194
Stop him!

1126
02:11:02,175 --> 02:11:04,938
Don't be a fool.

1127
02:11:05,444 --> 02:11:08,607
Why suffer an horrific death...

1128
02:11:08,814 --> 02:11:12,442
...when you can join me and live?

1129
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:13,742
Never!

1130
02:11:15,754 --> 02:11:20,522
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1131
02:11:21,294 --> 02:11:24,592
Tell me, Harry...

1132
02:11:24,796 --> 02:11:28,731
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1133
02:11:28,934 --> 02:11:30,993
Together...

1134
02:11:31,203 --> 02:11:33,797
...we can bring them back.

1135
02:11:34,172 --> 02:11:38,871
All I ask is for something in return.

1136
02:11:45,650 --> 02:11:48,710
That's it, Harry.

1137
02:11:49,653 --> 02:11:53,556
There is no good and evil.

1138
02:11:53,759 --> 02:11:56,751
There is only power...

1139
02:11:56,962 --> 02:12:01,058
...and those too weak to seek it.

1140
02:12:01,766 --> 02:12:06,760
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1141
02:12:07,204 --> 02:12:09,468
Just give me the Stone!

1142
02:12:12,044 --> 02:12:13,272
You liar!

1143
02:12:13,477 --> 02:12:15,604
Kill him!

1144
02:12:39,136 --> 02:12:44,471
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1145
02:14:29,678 --> 02:14:32,237
Good afternoon, Harry.

1146
02:14:34,348 --> 02:14:38,808
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1147
02:14:39,020 --> 02:14:45,051
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1148
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:50,059
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1149
02:14:52,365 --> 02:14:56,062
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1150
02:14:56,269 --> 02:14:59,104
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1151
02:14:59,307 --> 02:15:02,298
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1152
02:15:02,509 --> 02:15:07,378
Fine. They're both just fine.

1153
02:15:07,948 --> 02:15:10,782
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1154
02:15:11,052 --> 02:15:14,179
The Stone has been destroyed.

1155
02:15:14,387 --> 02:15:18,380
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1156
02:15:18,592 --> 02:15:22,585
...and agreed it was best all around.

1157
02:15:22,796 --> 02:15:26,596
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1158
02:15:28,668 --> 02:15:34,129
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1159
02:15:34,341 --> 02:15:37,605
But yes, he will die.

1160
02:15:37,810 --> 02:15:40,211
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1161
02:15:40,413 --> 02:15:43,007
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1162
02:15:43,216 --> 02:15:47,310
You see, only a person...

1163
02:15:47,552 --> 02:15:51,511
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1164
02:15:51,723 --> 02:15:56,321
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1165
02:15:57,264 --> 02:16:00,790
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1166
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:06,027
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1167
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:12,707
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1168
02:16:12,912 --> 02:16:15,244
I'm afraid...

1169
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:20,711
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1170
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:23,980
Harry, do you know why...

1171
02:16:24,189 --> 02:16:28,182
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1172
02:16:28,394 --> 02:16:33,059
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1173
02:16:33,566 --> 02:16:36,830
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1174
02:16:37,036 --> 02:16:40,767
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1175
02:16:40,973 --> 02:16:45,933
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1176
02:16:46,778 --> 02:16:50,476
Love, Harry. Love.

1177
02:16:58,523 --> 02:17:02,722
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1178
02:17:02,928 --> 02:17:07,592
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1179
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:11,132
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1180
02:17:11,336 --> 02:17:14,737
But I think I could be safe...

1181
02:17:14,939 --> 02:17:17,272
...with a nice toffee.

1182
02:17:21,346 --> 02:17:22,937
Alas!

1183
02:17:23,613 --> 02:17:25,707
Earwax.

1184
02:17:40,997 --> 02:17:44,162
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1185
02:17:45,303 --> 02:17:47,965
All right. Hermione?

1186
02:17:48,673 --> 02:17:50,504
Never better.

1187
02:18:06,290 --> 02:18:08,780
Another year gone.

1188
02:18:09,525 --> 02:18:14,088
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1189
02:18:14,297 --> 02:18:16,925
And the points stand thus:

1190
02:18:17,134 --> 02:18:22,867
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1191
02:18:24,874 --> 02:18:30,507
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1192
02:18:35,785 --> 02:18:37,615
In second place...

1193
02:18:37,819 --> 02:18:42,622
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1194
02:18:48,330 --> 02:18:49,991
And in first place...

1195
02:18:50,366 --> 02:18:55,770
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1196
02:19:01,377 --> 02:19:03,538
Nice one, mate.

1197
02:19:07,417 --> 02:19:11,476
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1198
02:19:11,753 --> 02:19:16,054
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1199
02:19:16,258 --> 02:19:21,218
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1200
02:19:21,864 --> 02:19:27,324
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1201
02:19:27,535 --> 02:19:30,368
...while others were in grave peril...

1202
02:19:31,072 --> 02:19:33,302
...50 points.

1203
02:19:34,242 --> 02:19:35,540
Good job.

1204
02:19:43,218 --> 02:19:49,282
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1205
02:19:49,791 --> 02:19:55,058
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1206
02:19:59,666 --> 02:20:01,691
And third...

1207
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:05,103
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1208
02:20:05,306 --> 02:20:09,639
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1209
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:15,113
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1210
02:20:23,423 --> 02:20:25,323
We're tied with Slytherin!

1211
02:20:25,526 --> 02:20:31,556
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1212
02:20:31,765 --> 02:20:35,633
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1213
02:20:35,836 --> 02:20:38,805
I award 10 points...

1214
02:20:39,006 --> 02:20:42,202
...to Neville Longbottom.

1215
02:20:55,555 --> 02:20:58,992
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1216
02:20:59,192 --> 02:21:03,720
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1217
02:21:08,735 --> 02:21:12,102
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1218
02:21:50,209 --> 02:21:53,543
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1219
02:21:53,747 --> 02:21:57,978
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1220
02:22:03,456 --> 02:22:06,754
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1221
02:22:13,032 --> 02:22:16,728
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1222
02:22:20,105 --> 02:22:21,801
This is for you.

1223
02:22:38,557 --> 02:22:40,650
Thanks, Hagrid.

1224
02:22:46,563 --> 02:22:50,967
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1225
02:22:51,369 --> 02:22:55,829
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1226
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:58,771
...you could always threaten him...

1227
02:22:58,977 --> 02:23:01,877
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1228
02:23:02,079 --> 02:23:07,142
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1229
02:23:07,551 --> 02:23:11,920
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1230
02:23:17,461 --> 02:23:20,589
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1231
02:23:20,798 --> 02:23:22,891
I'm not going home.

1232
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,000
Not really.
