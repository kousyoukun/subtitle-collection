1
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:20,229
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house,

2
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:25,858
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

3
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,547
Goddamn, Day-Day.

4
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:15,342
Take it all.
One, two, get up, three.

5
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,304
That's what I'm talkin' about.

6
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,317
Damn! That's an ugly-ass baby.
Eyes cocked like a pistol.

7
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,788
All I want, Santa Claus,
is two fat bitches and a bag of weed

8
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:42,207
and two bags of chips
to give to the fat bitches.

9
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,041
What the...

10
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,122
Damn, these niggas are broke.

11
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:51,082
No Christmas ham in here. Nothing.

12
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:52,920
lt's a damn shame.

13
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:55,420
All l want is two fat bitches
and some cheeseburgers

14
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,306
so Cheeco can lick on them

15
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,515
and two years' supply
of rolling paper.

16
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:02,223
Two pieces of bologna. Yeah, baby.

17
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:05,647
This gonna be good right here.
I'm so hungry.

18
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,234
What the hell
you doin' in my house

19
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,028
eatin' a big-ass sandwich and shit?

20
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:13,521
Nigga, I'm Santa Claus.
Where's the milk and cookies?

21
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:15,194
Santa Claus!

22
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:16,483
Shit!

23
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:18,819
You better get your ass outta here!

24
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:20,028
Goddamn!

25
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,783
Day-Day! Day-Day!

26
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:43,725
All I want is a fat bitch with
a name belt that say ''Glitter'' on it.

27
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:50,267
Day-Day! Help me, man!

28
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:01,948
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

29
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:16,219
As you can see.

30
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:18,842
I got my black ass
back in the ghetto.

31
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:21,304
the only place
where you can get robbed

32
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,551
by Santa Claus
on Chistmas Eve.

33
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:24,759
Shit!

34
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:28,188
I don't know if I can handle
another goddamn Friday.

35
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:29,649
This shit hurt.

36
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:33,896
Day-Day! Wake up, man!
We just got robbed!

37
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:37,438
Get your scary ass up, man!
I know you heard that shit!

38
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,071
Get out of here, man!

39
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,744
Wake your ass up!

40
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,657
Come on, man,
I gotta call the po-po!

41
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:49,543
What you say? Damn.

42
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:52,047
We just got robbed, Cheeco.

43
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:07,569
Unit 415. man
in the middle of the street.

44
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,653
Then what happened?

45
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,782
Then I caught him.
I hit him, like, four times.

46
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:15,875
I would've been a boxer,
but I was in Special Education.

47
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,332
I'm telling you,
I was whooping his ass!

48
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,414
Craig got to fightin' with him,
he beat his ass.

49
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,166
- Go check out the bedrooms.
- Sure.

50
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:23,966
What else did he get?

51
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:27,555
Like I said,
he took all of our presents,

52
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,631
he took my CD collection,

53
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:33,057
he even took
Day-Day's baby pictures.

54
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:36,228
And he got our speaker
with all our rent money in it.

55
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:37,345
Rent money!

56
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,143
- Sit your ass down!
- Who got the rent money?!

57
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:43,987
You ain't about to do nothin'.

58
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:45,614
Jumpin' up like you Mr. Get Bad.

59
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:48,272
Where was you when he was
beatin' my ass with that tree?

60
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:51,037
- Craig, my leg is hurtin', man.
- Good!

61
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,157
Yeah, he got
the rent money. All of it.

62
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,786
You're positive he was dressed
like Santa Claus?

63
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:59,082
Jolly white fat guy,
little red suit,

64
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,005
couple elves packin' the bags.

65
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,632
He's a project Santa Claus.

66
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:06,386
Picture Ol' Dirty Bastard
in a Santa Claus suit.

67
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,046
Can you picture that?

68
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:10,807
Do you know who
Ol' Dirty Bastard is?

69
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,847
I'm not big on that.

70
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,891
You oughta be nervous.
You a black cop.

71
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:17,647
You two motherfuckers huddle up
or something and find this dude.

72
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,272
Stay right there.

73
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:20,847
I ain't goin' nowhere.

74
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,519
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

75
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,686
- You're gonna sit in the car.
- Do your fucking job!

76
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,238
You're pushing the wrong buttons.

77
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,149
We the victims, man.

78
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:31,325
That victim shit is way overblown.

79
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,533
Just sit there and shut up.

80
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:35,080
Asshole.

81
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:37,157
Santa Claus strikes again.

82
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,622
Makes me want to go home
and lock up all my shit.

83
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,750
You gotta stop talking
to the police like that.

84
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:43,877
Shut up! You better stop
talking to me like that.

85
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:46,420
I could kick your ass
for the way you actin' this morning.

86
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:48,051
We gonna have our Christmas party?

87
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:51,552
How we gonna have a party
with our apartment looking like this?

88
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,806
We can't cancel the party, man!
What about the hos we had coming?

89
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:56,552
I invited some nice-ass girls.

90
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:57,925
They gonna fuck for a buck,

91
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,930
do something strange
for a little piece of change,

92
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:02,478
and I know we gonna
make them holler for a dollar.

93
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,643
One said they was gonna
suck my dick from the back.

94
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,024
I ain't never had that
ever happen to me.

95
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:12,273
I'm trying to go see
what that be like right there--

96
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:15,453
Look, man, I don't give
a shit about you, that party.

97
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,032
All I got to worry about is the rent,

98
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,910
and it was your idea
to use half the rent money...

99
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,914
Dix, I think we got something here.

100
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:27,129
Well, well. Whose is this?

101
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,423
Actually, it's both of ours.

102
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,542
No, it ain't!

103
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:34,430
lt is, but it's for
medicinal uses only.

104
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:37,350
I mean, he got cataract,
lazy eye, a little glaucoma.

105
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:40,685
- See that eye right there?
- Little shot of gonorrhea, see?

106
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,345
Do you guys have any idea
what we could do to you for this?

107
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,813
- No.
- Juvenile center?

108
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,819
We can make your Christmas
worse than it already is.

109
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,019
Being that it's Friday,

110
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,819
that means you're not gonna
see a judge till possibly Monday.

111
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:53,988
Maybe.

112
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:57,611
But, since we're nice guys,
we'll just confiscate this plant,

113
00:10:57,705 --> 00:11:00,279
take it with us until we find
this Santa Claus character.

114
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,367
That's fucked up, too.

115
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,951
Oh, hey,
and when we find St. Nick,

116
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:07,715
what do y'all want us
to do to him, you know?

117
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,417
Cracked ribs, fractured skull,
little eye gouge?

118
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:14,049
Fractured skull,
beat the shit out that motherfucker.

119
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:17,175
- Eye gouge, that's the shit.
- And an eye gouge.

120
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:20,220
I say stick a plunger in his ass,
like they did in New York.

121
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,387
Fractured skull.

122
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,098
This is Officer Brian Dix.
I'm Officer Alvin Hole.

123
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,935
We'll let you know
if anything develops.

124
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:31,147
Officer A. Hole and B. Dix.

125
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,614
We'll call you...

126
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,940
if we find anything.

127
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:38,028
I like them police right there.

128
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,866
You got a big pile of dog shit
in the middle of your bed.

129
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,415
You might want to check that out.

130
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:47,915
Merry Christmas.

131
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:51,335
He's the dick.

132
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,300
What the hell
is going on around here?!

133
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,880
Happy Holidays, Miss Pearly.

134
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:59,182
Police running in and out!
What the hell is going on?

135
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:02,221
Somebody broke in
and stole all our stuff.

136
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,722
That bullshit security.

137
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:06,351
I sure hope they
didn't get the rent money

138
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:09,014
'cause you two niggas
been ducking and dodging me

139
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,273
for about three weeks now.

140
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,392
Me--

141
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:16,030
Today is the day
you motherfuckers is gonna kick in!

142
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:19,071
Why you always bring your ass
up here harassing us?

143
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:20,656
With that big ol' wolf pussy?

144
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:23,035
You come here all the time
smelling like that.

145
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,793
- You don't even own the place!
- You just the manager.

146
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:29,293
And I'm gonna manage
to evict your skinny-punk black ass

147
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,915
out of here today if you two
motherfuckers don't pay up your rent.

148
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,215
Man, get that lined up.

149
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,876
Don't you worry about it, bitch.
I know somebody like it.

150
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:41,721
Take your ass back downstairs,
'cause you ain't evictin' nobody

151
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,932
unless you got
a motherfucking army with you.

152
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,519
I don't need no army, Mr. Smart-Ass!

153
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:50,014
My son Damon home right now.

154
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,188
Damon!

155
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:54,029
I had a nightmare
about that fool last night.

156
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,567
Day-Day!

157
00:12:56,657 --> 00:12:58,235
Craig!

158
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:02,491
Which one of you bitches
want to wash my drawers tonight?

159
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,122
- That'd be him.
- Him.

160
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,072
Okay.

161
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:10,252
I wash on Sundays, anyway.

162
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:11,962
Starch or press?

163
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,542
Starch, nigga!

164
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,590
Move!

165
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,588
Come on in, Miss Pearly.

166
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,254
- When did he get out?
- Last night.

167
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:25,975
And I'm gonna let you two bitches
in on a little secret--

168
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:29,680
when you spend 12 years
on a level-4 prison yard,

169
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:33,937
you become quite fond
of little ol' girls like yourselves.

170
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:36,946
So either I'm gonna
get my rent money today,

171
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:40,281
or somebody getting
their salad tossed tonight!

172
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:41,399
Damn!

173
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:42,905
That ain't even necessary.

174
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,027
Sure ain't!

175
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,447
We start our new job today,

176
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,032
and I swear to God we're gonna
have your money later on tonight--

177
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,415
cash...in your hand!

178
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:52,749
You better!

179
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,916
Either you fixin' to come see me,
or Damon gonna come see you.

180
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,754
Simple as that.

181
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:01,922
You like 'cause your son is a fag?

182
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:03,841
Shut up, bitch!

183
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:09,762
Tell your fine daddy I said...

184
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,145
I hate that bitch!

185
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:18,645
Tight-ass pants, man! Shit!

186
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:22,315
Look how tight
these motherfucking pants are.

187
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,983
I can't even do
the James Brown in these pants.

188
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,036
Good. I don't want
to see you do the James Brown.

189
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:29,828
We ain't never gonna get
no pussy in these clothes.

190
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,162
I'm gonna get some.

191
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:33,209
Tasha, how we look?

192
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,624
Like a couple of rent-a-cops.

193
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,671
What about them rent-a-tits?

194
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,334
See, the clothes don't make the player,

195
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:42,255
the player make the clothes.

196
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:43,889
Rent-a-cops get pussy, too.

197
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:45,882
I'm not no rent-a-cop,
I'm a Top Flight Security

198
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,968
and don't you never forget it.

199
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,730
I swear, the first motherfucker
get out of hand...

200
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:52,889
- I'm gonna beat the--
- Shit!

201
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:54,607
Craig and Day-Day.

202
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,734
Just the niggas I need to see.

203
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,815
Yo, what's up, O.G., triple O.G.,

204
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,944
O.G. triple, triple...O.G.?

205
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,447
You got out last night?

206
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:08,744
I ain't seen y'all
in about 12 years, nigga.

207
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:10,539
I was little. I was about--

208
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,823
You're grown up now, though.

209
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:15,495
Give a nigga a hug, dawg.

210
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,209
I'm about to go--

211
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:24,216
lt's cool, dawg, it's cool. Come here.

212
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:26,004
Yeah, right there.

213
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,971
- Group hug, nigga.
- Come on, Craig.

214
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,302
All right, come here.

215
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:34,722
Get your ass over here.
Talk to you for a minute.

216
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,559
What's up, dawg?

217
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,228
lt's good to be home,

218
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,486
'cause in the prison, dawg,
ain't nothin' but the fellas, nigga.

219
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,861
- That's what I heard.
- I swear, man.

220
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,322
We got to care about each other.

221
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:47,739
That's right.

222
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,743
Somebody go get my mother!

223
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,161
I heard you motherfuckers
ain't paid your rent this month.

224
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:58,246
Ducking and dodging
my moms and shit!

225
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,708
Get your tittie off my chin!

226
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:04,251
Show up here tonight
without that rent money,

227
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:07,346
and we gonna get
real motherfucking acquainted.

228
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,511
You dig?

229
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:12,051
- I can't breathe, I swear to God!
- He can't breathe!

230
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,224
Do you dig?!

231
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,186
I'm feeling you, dawg. Trust me.

232
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,598
- Digging it.
- Good, good.

233
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,017
'Cause I'm gonna
only say this shit once.

234
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,529
Come on, man, let's go.

235
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:26,360
Y'all look good in your little
tight-ass rent-a-cop outfits.

236
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,739
Merry Christmas, niggettes.

237
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:32,660
Shit, man! That's bullshit, man.

238
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:35,584
He's gonna try and do
something strange to us!

239
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,412
I'm gonna think of something.

240
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:38,914
That's fucked up, man.

241
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:41,674
He might do something strange
to you, though.

242
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,430
Puff-puff and give, motherfucker.

243
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:53,303
This is good shit.
I ain't gonna be your mother--

244
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:55,351
- Damn!
- Hurry up!

245
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,866
About a yean ago.
my Pops quit his dog-catching job

246
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:12,870
and went into business
with my Uncle Elroy.

247
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,791
They opened up a spot
called Bros. Barb-B-Q.

248
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,829
''Tastes so good.
make you wanna slap youn mama. ''

249
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,793
You might've
seen the commencial.

250
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,453
Y'all tired of that barbecue
from up the street.

251
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,376
where they give you
more sauce than meat?

252
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:27,544
Bning youn big ass down
to Bros. Bar-B-Q.

253
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:30,342
15837 South Crenshaw Boulevard.

254
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:31,925
That's right off Manciesten.

255
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:35,681
Bros. Bar-B-Q. Tastes so good.
make you want to slap youn mama!

256
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,849
Don't it. Willie?

257
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:38,930
Yeah. boy. Hey. Mama.

258
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,434
What the hell you want?

259
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:45,314
Ain't but one location.
so it's nearest you.

260
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:46,863
You might've missed it.

261
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:49,439
They only had enough money
for a 15-second spot.

262
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,692
But. anyway. my Pops
got me and Day-Day

263
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:54,573
thesejobs
at the same strip mall

264
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:56,407
as Christmas-help security.

265
00:17:56,499 --> 00:18:00,828
Look, Day-Day,
we only security guards, okay?

266
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,913
Ghetto security guards at that.

267
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:05,841
We ain't Cops.
we ain't America's Most Wanted.

268
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:09,045
NYPD Blue.
none of that shit you watch.

269
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,844
We something like them.

270
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,175
No. Nothing like it.

271
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:15,385
All we gonna do--take it easy,
make this money,

272
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:17,136
you're gonna watch your temper--

273
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,343
I ain't got to watch shit!

274
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:20,560
You gonna treat people right,
talk to people right.

275
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:22,937
You can get your ass kicked
around here real quick.

276
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,899
I don't care about it
getting out of hand.

277
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:27,062
I ain't getting into shit
because of you.

278
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,859
This is a job, man.
This ain't an adventure.

279
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:32,820
This is real, and I'm gonna
let you know, I'm not having it.

280
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,618
Everybody's a suspect today.

281
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:36,281
And I told you, I'm a player.

282
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:38,365
I don't care about none of that.

283
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,454
Damn!

284
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:42,749
Get your ass out, player.

285
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:44,117
Fuck, you remedial!

286
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,087
- What does that mean?
- Retarded!

287
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:48,795
- That wasn't nothing.
- Dumb-ass, let's go.

288
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,213
I mess up all the time.

289
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,262
Come here! Look!

290
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,479
- That's him!
- Let's get that mother!

291
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:12,277
Get him! Kick him!

292
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,867
- Craig! Day-Day!
- Uncle Willie!

293
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,364
What the hell you doing to me?

294
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:19,946
What's happening?

295
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,203
Man, I didn't know!

296
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,748
Pop, I thought
you were somebody else!

297
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:26,327
Willie, what are you doing
to them boys back there?

298
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,415
Nothing! I'm counting
money at the register.

299
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,631
These fools
knock the hell out of me...

300
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:34,383
We made a mistake. Day-Day
ran in and jumped on Daddy!

301
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,717
He's lying!

302
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,883
Why you boys
beating up on Santa Claus?

303
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,466
He broke in our house
and stole our presents.

304
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,135
- And Craig let him do it!
- Why, Craig?

305
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,018
- Why blame me?
- 'Cause you did!

306
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,817
I tried to fight him, and Day-Day...

307
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,895
I was screaming,
he wouldn't even help.

308
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,814
What did you do, Day-Day?

309
00:19:51,906 --> 00:19:54,064
Nothing!
He stayed asleep the whole time.

310
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:55,534
Can I tell my story?

311
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:58,821
I ain't done shit, but he could have
did something about it!

312
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:00,538
What did he look like?

313
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:03,292
Like Bobby Brown
in a goddamned Santa Claus suit!

314
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,621
I heard about him.

315
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,044
They call him
the ''Santa Clause Crook.''

316
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:10,337
He robbed a lady
in the parking lot last week.

317
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,713
He called her
a ''ho ho ho'' and kept running.

318
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:14,296
Who the fuck are you?

319
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:19,215
I'm Cookie, the new waitress,
and, um...

320
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:22,226
Elroy's new girlfriend.

321
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,559
You got another one?
You're gonna catch something!

322
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,435
You should have kept
Sugar's nasty ass. What happened?

323
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,602
I kicked her country ass
to the curb.

324
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,937
Hooked up with her little sister.

325
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,904
That's how we players roll!

326
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:40,531
Elroy, read my lips--
you ain't no player!

327
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,243
You don't know nothing
about being a player.

328
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,829
Betty done had your ass
pussy-whipped for about 30 years!

329
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,162
Nobody got me pussy-whipped.

330
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:53,839
l...whips...pussy!

331
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,096
You boys look really good
with your rent-a-cop outfits on.

332
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:02,594
Yes, very attractive.

333
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:06,469
This is Top Flight Security.
We ain't no rent-a-cops.

334
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,058
Daddy, how I look?

335
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,645
- Like a damn snitch!
- Man, that's cold!

336
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:14,441
Look like you're ready
to tell on somebody right now!

337
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,068
Where's your flashlight at?
You're supposed to have one.

338
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:19,281
You've got to shine some damn body!

339
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:22,951
We're supposed to get handcuffs,
flashlights, taser guns--

340
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,237
Two German shepherds.

341
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:27,950
Y'all must not know what happened
to the last security guards.

342
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:32,714
Mama's in the kitchen with the sauce.

343
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,590
Aw, shit! The sauce! Move, girl!

344
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,715
What happened
to the other two sec--

345
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:37,917
Wait a minute!

346
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:39,803
Go say hello to your grandmother.

347
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,462
Come on, let's go. Move your big ass!

348
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:45,096
What happened with
the last two security guards?

349
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:50,222
- Wake up, Mama.
- What the hell you want?

350
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:52,807
You burned the sauce again.
Give me the spoon.

351
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:54,396
Nobody's gonna hit you.

352
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,776
You've lost your mind
since Willie slapped you.

353
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,442
Damn, what happened to her?

354
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:01,202
You should never have let her
into the commercial, anyway.

355
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:02,744
Got no business working.

356
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,786
You're the one
gave her a concussion, Willie.

357
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:07,909
- You were supposed to be acting.
- I should have smacked you!

358
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,080
How's she doing?

359
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,917
Hey, Big Mama, you all right?

360
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:15,247
- Who are you?
- lt's Craig, Mama.

361
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:17,464
- Who Craig?
- Don't worry about it.

362
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:20,506
Your oldest grandson.
The smart one, not Day-Day.

363
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,087
She's still having blackouts
and blurred vision.

364
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:24,641
Bet you remember Day-Day!

365
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,884
Why you always
playing with her all the time?

366
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,136
That's enough
damn salt there, Willie.

367
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,938
I know what I'm doing.

368
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:33,349
Don't nobody want all that salt
in their potato salad!

369
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:34,687
Y'all argue too much!

370
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:37,066
What's wrong with y'all?
Y'all should get married.

371
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,859
Why are you in so much
competition with me?

372
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:41,360
You jealous, Willie.

373
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:44,120
I can't help it!
I look better than you do!

374
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:45,282
You don't.

375
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:46,996
- I cook better than you.
- You can't.

376
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:50,248
- My dick is bigger than yours.
- lt was cold that night.

377
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:53,538
Think--last year at this time,
you had won the Lotto,

378
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:55,752
over $1 million.

379
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,794
Anybody else would be living
in the French Riviera.

380
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,173
You're back here
cooking pigs' feet with me

381
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:03,255
at Bros. B-B-B-Bar-B-Q.

382
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:05,424
You tied-tongued dog catcher!

383
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:08,434
You best check on the sauce.
Mama's out on her feet again.

384
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:10,014
Dumb-ass dog catcher.

385
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:13,604
''I'm a Lotto stud.
Lotto fucking stud.''

386
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:16,360
So after Pops and Unc argued
for another 15 minutes.

387
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:18,152
it was time
to meet our new boss.

388
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:19,352
His name is Moly.

389
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:22,863
He ran the whole strip mall
and owned Holy Moly Donuts.

390
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:28,953
But trust me. don't even. even. even.
even. even. even. even eat there.

391
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,082
We'll take the usual, Moly.

392
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:37,083
How you doing, boy?

393
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:39,415
Good, buddy.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

394
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:41,382
Happy Hanukkah. L'claim.

395
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:42,749
These are my boys.

396
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:44,921
I'll be with you
in just one minute, buddy.

397
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:47,090
Take your time.

398
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,092
Just be still.

399
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:50,845
What's up? How's business?

400
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:53,688
Everything is wonderful. Yeah, boy!

401
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,564
Have you seen our commercial?

402
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,485
Barbecue so good, makes you
want to smack your mama.

403
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:02,571
- What the fu--
- Hey, buddy!

404
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,281
What the fuck wrong with you?

405
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,027
Sorry, buddy. Reaction.

406
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:09,203
Hey, guys, I hear
someone's looking for a job.

407
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:10,783
I want to ask a question.

408
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:11,905
l...okay.

409
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,707
When we get our guns?

410
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:16,414
No guns. You are Top Flight
unarmed security guards.

411
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:19,042
- What about walkie-talkies?
- And flashlights?

412
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:22,547
Whoever catch the girl back there
giving head behind the trash can?

413
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:25,552
I have to come back there
with the flashlight and catch her.

414
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:29,303
You are supposed to be tough guys.
You don't need gadgets, huh?

415
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:31,349
All you need is this here.

416
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:34,930
lf there's any problems,
you just blow. Toot-toot!

417
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:37,430
These guys are here
all the time. They come running.

418
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:39,103
Goddamn, Craig!

419
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:41,316
- Can we have more donuts?
- Please.

420
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:43,729
See? Very quick
response time, huh?

421
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:45,614
You guys ready for tour of property?

422
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,866
Give me a twister. Make it two.
Hold the flies.

423
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:51,278
Keep up. Come on.
One-two, one-two, one-two.

424
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:52,451
Come on.

425
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,372
Since you've been here many times,
I'm gonna make it short and sweet.

426
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,741
Buddy, come on.

427
00:24:57,837 --> 00:25:00,126
As you know, this here is my place.

428
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:02,540
This is
the Holy Moly Donut Shop, huh?

429
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,670
Say it with me, guys--
''Holy Moly Donut Shop.''

430
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:11,640
Very good. You get one
free bear claw every lunch break.

431
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,395
- Come on, guys.
- Come on, come on.

432
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,775
Okay.
Over here is the Chrome Dome.

433
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,734
You got cars, they got rims.

434
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,905
This, of course, is your
family business, Bros. Bar-B-Q.

435
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,196
That's check cashing.
No l.D. required.

436
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:31,036
This one here
is a brand-new store.

437
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,988
lt's Pimps and Hos--
some kind of flashy clothing.

438
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,743
- Damn!
- Damn!

439
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,494
Who is that?

440
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:41,587
That's Donna.
She's the owner's girlfriend.

441
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:45,088
He's a funny-dressing kind of guy
from out of town or something.

442
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:50,086
He's kind of a pig, though.
He treat her like shit, man.

443
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,339
I would love for her
to be one of my wives, huh?

444
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,141
Damn, how many wives you got?

445
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:56,266
Me? 12, buddy.

446
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,430
Yeah. All of them freaks, too, huh?

447
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,978
# Freaks come out at night,
what, what, what? #

448
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:02,609
# Freaks come out at night... #

449
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,069
Whodini. You know Who--

450
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,980
Yeah, buddy! Okay!

451
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:09,690
He's a character. Real big character.

452
00:26:09,784 --> 00:26:11,575
He's short but big.

453
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,247
# Hold up, wait a minute,
let me put some pimping in it #

454
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:23,419
He's funny-looking, huh?

455
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:26,423
I don't know. Why he dress like this?

456
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:29,593
How are you? Doesn't matter.
Get the trunk.

457
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,710
Thank you.

458
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,133
He's got problems.

459
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,093
Quickly, now, quickly.
Got a business to run.

460
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:37,426
Hey, buddy.

461
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,474
And don't drag that coat.

462
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,186
lt costs more than you do.

463
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,236
Okay, and over here,
this is a liquor store.

464
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:50,358
Don't let nobody hang out
in front of liquor store.

465
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,481
Nobody, buddy.

466
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,774
Nobody.

467
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:55,988
And this is your booth.

468
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,159
Any questions?

469
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,656
- l've got one question.
- What's up, buddy?

470
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,621
What happened to the last guards
that worked here?

471
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:06,579
You ask too many questions, man.
lt's time to get to work.

472
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:09,675
Remember, you guys are
Top Flight security guards,

473
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,670
best in the whole world, huh?

474
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,598
You have to defend this whole place
with your own life.

475
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:16,426
And I'll die for this shit, too.

476
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:19,767
Remember, Christmas Eve
means lots of shoppers.

477
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:22,345
lf there's any trouble,
you come get me--

478
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,729
when you take care of it,
then come get me.

479
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,691
Okay, go, go. Come on.

480
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:29,269
Come on. Keep it real, huh?

481
00:27:29,363 --> 00:27:32,068
When are you gonna ask him
for an advancement

482
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,652
on our first week's pay?

483
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:36,412
Don't worry about that.
I'll ask when the time is right.

484
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:38,203
Just keep your rabbit-ass mouth shut.

485
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,160
- Remember what Damon said.
- You remember what I said.

486
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,746
Don't start trying to outthink me,
because you're gonna hurt yourself.

487
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,840
Where you think you going?

488
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,594
- lt's small in here.
- No, you're big in here.

489
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,677
Get off my foot!

490
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,427
- Just scoot over there.
- You scoot over, man!

491
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:06,689
This shit is uncomfortable, man.
Can't even move in here.

492
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:09,481
So what? Just deal with it. I got to.

493
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,197
What are we gonna do now?

494
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:14,607
Sit here and wait
for something to happen.

495
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,987
Not me.

496
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,739
That shit is boring, man.

497
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,452
Good. I like boring.
Easy money for us.

498
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,949
I hope
don't nothing happen all day.

499
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:27,713
We can sit and watch these females
shop till they drop.

500
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:29,920
Matter of fact, watch out.

501
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:34,708
Ain't this a bitch?
I'm waiting on some action to jump off.

502
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:36,464
You heard what Mr. Moly said.

503
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:39,225
We Top Flight
security of the world, Craig!

504
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:42,013
Shit! Not just the city, the world!

505
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:45,139
Been jacked by Santa Claus,
all kind of shit.

506
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:47,354
They need security
in the world, Craig!

507
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:48,556
Shit!

508
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:51,486
For one thing, calm down.
Slow your roll.

509
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,148
Don't let that man pump you up
and get your ass shot out here.

510
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:59,362
We ain't no damn
Top Flight security of the world!

511
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:02,407
We Craig and Day-Day,
so just kick back, relax--

512
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:04,906
You heard what happened
to the last security guards.

513
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,326
You didn't even hear what happened,

514
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,709
so how the fuck was I gonna hear it?

515
00:29:09,797 --> 00:29:12,086
Just do your job,
and I'm gonna do mine.

516
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:15,923
- Shit.
- No problem.

517
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:18,503
- I'm gonna do my job.
- No problem.

518
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:20,674
Get your damn feet
out of my f--

519
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:28,939
# Joy to the world,
the Lord is come #

520
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:31,694
Bingo! I got action.

521
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,528
What's up?

522
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:38,900
# Let every heart
prepare him room #

523
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:41,401
# And heaven and nature sing... #

524
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,827
Heaven and--
fuck all that shit!

525
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:54,588
Y'all hos got to get off
this corner with that!

526
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,335
Excuse me, sugar,
what did you just say?

527
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,214
You heard me what I said.
Y'all hos got to move off this corner.

528
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:01,463
You better watch
your little filthy mouth.

529
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:03,764
You are talking
to children of the Lord.

530
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:04,966
That's right!

531
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:07,552
I want you to know
who you're talking to, too--

532
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,138
Top Flight
motherfucking security!

533
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:13,269
You can't talk to these
old-ass ladies like that!

534
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,270
Just back me up
and do your damn job!

535
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:17,402
Y'all movin' on
and take that shit--

536
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,325
Wait a minute, bitch!
I ain't no killer, you understand me?

537
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,153
But don't you push me,
don't you touch me!

538
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:25,578
You gonna make me blow this.
I'll clear all this shit out with this.

539
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:28,072
Joker, fuck you and your whistle!

540
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:31,583
Y'all trying to use the Lord
to sell pussy on this corner.

541
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:33,628
Shut your little filthy mouth!

542
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:37,086
Calm down.

543
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:40,296
Let's go on to church, and we
gonna pray for these niggas.

544
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:42,926
Have mercy, Jesus.
Forgive me, Lord.

545
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,558
What's wrong with you?

546
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,643
You can't talk to people like that.
That's somebody grandmama, fool!

547
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:50,219
I can talk to people
any fucking way I want to,

548
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:52,188
and I'm the law around here.

549
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:54,766
And I'm gonna write your ass up
for insubordination.

550
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:57,149
Let me do my job and you do yours.

551
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:58,518
Top Flight!

552
00:30:58,614 --> 00:31:01,699
Man. I couldn't believe
how Day-Day was acting.

553
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,026
Even since he got
that whistle around his neck.

554
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,907
He been acting like
a neal asshole rent-a-cop.

555
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,121
Look at him!

556
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,703
Where you going?

557
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:13,165
I'm trying to park so I can go
in the check-cashing place.

558
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:16,463
You can't park right here
because there's a new policy.

559
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,458
Give me the number,
or you can't park here.

560
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:20,425
I ain't never heard
of no policy like that.

561
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:24,011
You ain't never met a Top Flight
security nigga like me!

562
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:26,554
Give me the number
or get to fucking rolling.

563
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:30,225
Look at that fool.
I've got to put a stop to this shit.

564
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:32,436
...no parking spot, okay,
'cause I'm married!

565
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,809
- Get this piece of shit out of here!
- He's just playing.

566
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:37,978
No, I'm not playing.
You better not park!

567
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,778
- Bye-bye.
- Bring that car back here!

568
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,437
Man, what did I do?

569
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,778
I got this.

570
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,276
Why every time you get
a little position of power,

571
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,746
you abuse your authority?

572
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,739
You need to work
on your people skills.

573
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:52,952
That's bullshit. My people skills
are way better than yours.

574
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,333
Just sit down and relax.

575
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:01,500
Bingo! Got more action!

576
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:08,555
Get y'all little bad-ass mo'
over here!

577
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:11,264
Leave them damn kids alone!
They ain't messing with you!

578
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:17,560
Stop blowing that goddamn whistle!

579
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:19,644
What's wrong with you? You tripping!

580
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,896
Some L.A.P.D. shit.

581
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:24,694
You know what?
Don't hate...appreciate.

582
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:26,990
You're just mad
'cause I'm always on the...

583
00:32:28,454 --> 00:32:29,783
...crime whistle!

584
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:31,865
I'll calm your ass down
one way or another.

585
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,496
- You ain't got to calm me down.
- Fire that up.

586
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,622
Not on duty. Not on duty!

587
00:32:37,713 --> 00:32:39,291
You better fire this up!

588
00:32:39,382 --> 00:32:42,881
I ain't no grocery-store bouncer.
I'm a Top Flight security guard.

589
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:45,720
You got to recognize
the difference between the police--

590
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:49,055
- Light the shit.
- We are not little no more.

591
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:51,348
- Come on!
- What?

592
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,553
You know what?

593
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:59,354
You're not gonna be punking me
when we get 40.

594
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,279
This shit gonna stop one day, dude.

595
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:05,862
Well, it ain't
gonna stop today, so light it up

596
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,610
before I beat that ass.

597
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:09,990
- Whatever.
- Yeah, yeah.

598
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,202
This Barney Fife shit.

599
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,917
I'm thinking of something right now.

600
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:21,714
That's some good shit, right?

601
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,753
no. You're a bad-ass influence
on my life.

602
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:26,753
Ever since
l've been kicking it with you,

603
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:28,885
my life
has been a shambles, dude.

604
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:31,890
Give me my goddamn joint.

605
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,885
Hold on.
Let me hit it one more time.

606
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,267
One more time,
let me hit it, man!

607
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:37,850
You gave it to me to smoke!

608
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,226
I ain't no bad influence on you.
I'm the best cousin you've got.

609
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,438
lf it wasn't for me, you'd be
getting punked all the time.

610
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,567
And I keep you safe
and I keep you warm,

611
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,366
'cause you know
how little timid you are.

612
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:50,827
Look. Look.

613
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:53,903
Whatever.

614
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,076
Man, it's just us,
Craig and Day-Day. Damn!

615
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:02,543
I was about to Barry Bonds
y'all's black asses!

616
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:04,505
You almost made me
catch a heart attack!

617
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,546
I ought to hit your ass
and give you brain damage.

618
00:34:07,637 --> 00:34:10,424
Let me hit that before Willie
bring his old square ass out here.

619
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,551
You can go to jail
for some shit like that, for real.

620
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:15,600
He been real brand-new today.

621
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,145
How's it going out here so far?

622
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,973
lt's been boring and quiet.

623
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:20,393
Just wait around.

624
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:22,974
Them young thugs don't come out
till about 1 :00 or 1 :30.

625
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:26,105
They coming. I just pray to God
I'm here when they come.

626
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,732
Uncle Elroy gonna beat
the shit out of 'em!

627
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,320
Ho ho ho, motherfuckers!

628
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,902
What you looking at
before I shoot you in your mouth?

629
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:35,989
Up against the wall!

630
00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:37,541
Jesus!

631
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,997
Shut up! What you got, toothpick?

632
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,043
I ain't got nothing.

633
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,166
Done shit on yourself!
What you looking at?

634
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:46,538
Don't I know you?

635
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:49,386
You gonna know a bullet in your ass!
This all you got?

636
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,427
I ain't got nothing
but 20 funky-ass dollars.

637
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:53,886
I ought to shoot your broke ass.

638
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,303
What's up, Al Green?

639
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,844
You remind me of them old players
that be clubbing with young girls.

640
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:02,983
You remind me of a young nigga
fucking with the wrong old nigga!

641
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,819
He's gonna shoot your ass!
Get up against the wall!

642
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,441
Shut up! Give me the watch!

643
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:09,906
No, not the Rolie.

644
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:13,111
Now it's a ''stoley.''
Looking like a Mississippi pimp.

645
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:16,156
Bitch better have my
sweet potatoes. Top Flight Security!

646
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,453
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

647
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:20,332
Santa Claus got my Rolex!
Let's get him!

648
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,494
Do something! Do something!

649
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:27,044
- Don't just stand there. Help me.
- Shit! How?

650
00:35:28,134 --> 00:35:30,174
Move, move, move!

651
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,254
...three quarters,
two dimes, and a nickel!

652
00:35:38,728 --> 00:35:40,969
Y'all didn't hear me
blowing this whistle?

653
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:42,178
What is it, buddy?

654
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,974
We just got jacked by Santa Claus!
He almost tied us up and fucked us!

655
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,310
- He pulled out a pistol...
- Dodo, you on crack, buddy?

656
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:04,534
- Hey, man, just let it go.
- Get your goddamn hands off me!

657
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,211
Me, my cousin, and my daddy--
we just got jacked by Santa Claus!

658
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,959
But you're security guard, buddy.

659
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,886
That's why I asked your ass
for them two flashlights.

660
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,253
These guys!

661
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:18,009
That's why I hate the fuckin' law!

662
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:19,844
Get your fat ass up and do something!

663
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:21,845
You get up, too!

664
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:25,104
Give me flashlights,
or we gonna get killed around here!

665
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:27,267
Jacked by Santa Claus
on Christmas Eve!

666
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,851
Twice in one day!

667
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:33,315
You wanted to grab somebody,
you should've grabbed that nigga!

668
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:36,527
Security! You need to
turn in your damn whistle!

669
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,879
Where you going, Mama?

670
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:50,838
I'm going to make my daily rounds.

671
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:53,131
Could you make me a sandwich
when you get back?

672
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:55,212
Make your own damn sandwich.

673
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:08,232
Tupac. Tupac, Tupac!

674
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:10,939
Goddamn, you fine!

675
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,772
Ooh, the way
you talk gangsta, nigga!

676
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:34,751
Yoo-hoo!

677
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:36,920
Anybody home?

678
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,135
Ain't nobody here.

679
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:46,228
Oh, my goodness.

680
00:37:48,274 --> 00:37:51,560
What in the hell
done happened to the mail?

681
00:37:53,446 --> 00:37:55,735
I ain't the only one they owe.

682
00:37:57,617 --> 00:37:59,111
Dirty bastards.

683
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,795
This child is filthy!

684
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:23,508
Wishful thinking.

685
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,019
Weed!

686
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,319
Got me some weed!

687
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:38,405
That's why they ain't paid
their damn rent!

688
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:44,736
So what happened after that?

689
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:47,701
I don't want to talk about that.
Y'all ain't gonna catch no damn body.

690
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,461
I just want you to stop and whip
some ass on the way to the station.

691
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:52,205
Least I'll feel better then.

692
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,088
What were you doing
in the alley, anyway?

693
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:55,833
I was emptying the trash!

694
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:58,498
- I had already taken it out.
- Well, it was full!

695
00:38:58,594 --> 00:39:01,512
Don't you mess with this b-b-barbecue.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

696
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:05,547
I don't give a damn 'bout your lazy eye,
you Popeye-lookin' son of a--

697
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,727
Nah, wait a minute!
I started this barbecue shit!

698
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,767
ls this the motherfucking
thanks I get?

699
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,601
That's enough! Calm down!

700
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:16,397
I just appreciate you
even blessing me with your presence.

701
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,567
Bishop Magic Don Juan
and Money motherfucking Mike!

702
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,069
What they know about that?

703
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,784
Let me get this straight--

704
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,496
for the second time,
y'all got jacked by Santa Claus?

705
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,614
Black guy, wasn't it?

706
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,663
Nah. This was a nigga that did this.

707
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:35,079
lf I build it, the hos will come.
Learn from the best.

708
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,545
God bless you, Mike.
Keep your game tight, hear, player?

709
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:38,796
Absolutely.

710
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:40,545
...got Daddy's Rolex.

711
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:44,420
# Dashing through these hos
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

712
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,383
Everything is 25% off.
Everything must go.

713
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:50,221
Maybe even you.

714
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,347
Explain yourself now, player.

715
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:57,523
- Day-Day!
- Ow, Daddy!

716
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:58,726
You talk too damn much!

717
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:01,692
He didn't want to blow
his whistle, so I blew mine.

718
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:04,272
Pay attention!

719
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,073
That's the reason we got jacked
in the first damn place.

720
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,618
We'll make out our report
and get back to you.

721
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:14,334
Guys, y'all have to get dressed.
The kids will be here any minute.

722
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,749
Back to work.

723
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:29,342
I didn't know you can make
a snowman in 80-degree weather.

724
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:32,769
Anything is possible.
All you need is a can of snow.

725
00:40:32,855 --> 00:40:35,892
What's cracking? My name's Craig.

726
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,775
- I'm Donna.
- What's up, Donna?

727
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,604
What kind of stuff y'all sell in here?

728
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:43,111
We got everything--
FUBU, Sean John, Dada.

729
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:45,357
What are you looking for?

730
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:47,859
Anything's better than what I got on.

731
00:40:47,954 --> 00:40:50,112
What, you don't like the flashlight look?

732
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,790
I see you got jokes.

733
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:56,035
Well, you can always buy
your girlfriend something.

734
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:57,706
We have ladies' wear, too.

735
00:40:57,797 --> 00:40:59,172
Yeah, y'all do, huh?

736
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,296
I don't really got
a girlfriend, you know.

737
00:41:01,384 --> 00:41:03,673
I usually get rid of them
this time of year.

738
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,505
That way, you ain't got
to buy them shit.

739
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:08,300
For real?

740
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:09,422
Yeah, why not?

741
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:11,555
I'm just playing.

742
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,438
- I see you got jokes.
- A couple.

743
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:17,931
So that's your little
midget boyfriend?

744
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:20,101
Little micro-mini pimp
up in there?

745
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,356
Oh! What's cracking, baby?

746
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:27,695
My name is Day-Day, right?
This is my big-head-ass cousin.

747
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,193
You know, beevo-latte, got
more head than he got body.

748
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,912
Check this out--

749
00:41:31,998 --> 00:41:33,789
I just spotted you
way across from the lot,

750
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,959
and I'm gonna let you know,
it ain't your booty, it's your beauty.

751
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:39,583
lf you see anything
suspicious around here...

752
00:41:41,424 --> 00:41:43,333
Let me know, 'cause
I got my eyes on everything.

753
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:44,801
Let's start off with your number.

754
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:47,044
That's the only way we're gonna
be able to communicate.

755
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,214
No, you gotta get your ass
back to that booth.

756
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,098
But, man, she like me!

757
00:41:58,733 --> 00:41:59,847
Come on, woman.

758
00:41:59,942 --> 00:42:02,398
I can't move that fast
with this stomach.

759
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,360
Why you got to bring
your ass over here?

760
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:12,239
I was trying to see if she seen
a Santa Claus with a suit on.

761
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,280
- What your ass doing over here?
- You know what I'm doing over here.

762
00:42:18,044 --> 00:42:19,538
I just don't want no bullshit.

763
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:21,372
You know, all that
''my hair retain heat.''

764
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:22,792
I don't know nothin' about that.

765
00:42:22,882 --> 00:42:26,002
I'm sorry.
I have to go help them.

766
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:28,003
Fine piece, boy.

767
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,471
She fine.

768
00:42:29,555 --> 00:42:30,753
She liked me, didn't she?

769
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,137
- No.
- Yes, she did.

770
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:35,764
How she gonna like you
when she like me?

771
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,561
'Cause she hadn't seen me yet.

772
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:40,398
I wish I hadn't seen you yet.

773
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:41,598
Can I help you?

774
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,270
I just walked in the store.

775
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,982
Let me look around a little bit. Dang!

776
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:52,447
I could use some help over here.
ln the men's.

777
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:55,110
Burn a pimp,
see what happen to you.

778
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,578
That's all you gotta do,

779
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:00,205
l'd like this FUBU sweatshirt
with some socks.

780
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:02,327
Are you all right?

781
00:43:02,422 --> 00:43:04,295
I'm fine, I just--

782
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:13,762
This can't be happenin',
this can't be happenin'.

783
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,344
Oh, no, player!

784
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:18,641
- You see that?

785
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,434
Turn him off!
What the hell's wrong with him?

786
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:24,145
Come on, Bill, let's go.
I don't see nothing in here I like.

787
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:27,521
No, you ain't sick no more.

00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:30,819
Baby still kicking?

00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,568
Yeah, feel like twins.

791
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,653
- We saw that shit!

792
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,868
Let me go!

00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:37,987
Get ahold of her, man!

794
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,128
Stop letting her kick your ass!

795
00:43:44,213 --> 00:43:45,624
Y'all going to jail!

796
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:48,420
For shop-stealing
and stealing everything!

797
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:50,253
We ain't stole shit!

798
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:51,459
What about this?

799
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:52,717
Uh-huh!

00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:55,047
Aw, damn!

801
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:58,640
- That ain't nothin' you like?
- You going to jail, Cicely Tyson.

802
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:01,183
Girl, I can't believe you did this!
I'm appalled!

803
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:03,597
You ain't Paul!
You a nigga that steals!

804
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:12,276
Y'all got the game messed up!
Huh? You gonna steal from a pimp?

805
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:19,948
Where is Elroy?

806
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:22,117
He's in the back.
He doesn't want to come out.

807
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:23,289
What?!

808
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:24,836
Keep your voice down.

809
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:28,414
Merry Christmas, everybody.

810
00:44:28,508 --> 00:44:31,129
Come on out here right now

811
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:32,547
or you and I are gonna fight!

812
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:36,052
All the money we spent for these.
Get your butt out here, man.

813
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,680
Aw, Elroy, you look cute.

814
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:41,393
Oh, he's a cutie-pie.

815
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,804
We ought to be celebrating
Kwanzaa, anyway.

816
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:46,899
Messing with these kids' heads
with this white man's holiday.

817
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,692
Oh, shut up, Elroy.

818
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,067
Prance your ass over
and let them kids pet on you.

819
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,064
Oh, hell, no, Willie!

820
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,992
That's where I put my hoof down.
Ain't nobody pettin' on me!

821
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:58,650
Will you shut up?
Prance your ass over there!

822
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:01,284
Let them kids pet on you.
What's wrong with you?

823
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:03,699
That ain't prancin'. lt ain't Easter.

824
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:05,121
I ain't know no damn reindeer.

825
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:07,369

You ain't gotta do this.

00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:17,879
Shut the fuck up!

831
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:23,091

832
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,058

833
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:27,394
Hey, player.

835
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:33,018
Player!

836
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:34,572
Nah, nah, let him through.

837
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:35,985
You little shrimp motherfucker.

838
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:38,115
I'm gonna sue your ass!
Come on, cut me!

839
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,281
No, no, no!

840
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,699
Give me that, give me that.

841
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,997
I guarantee I wanna do my thing!

842
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:47,754
- Think about your mama, man.
- I'm thinking about your ass.

843
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:49,580
Think about what
your mama would say.

844
00:45:49,672 --> 00:45:51,250
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

845
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,377
You know what I'm saying?
I got a little razzle-dazzled.

846
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:57,220
My name is Money Mike, player.
How you doing?

847
00:45:57,305 --> 00:45:58,633
All right, don't squeeze hard.

848
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:00,431
All right, what's happening?

849
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:02,723
This is my young girl Donna.
Say hi, woman.

850
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,842
What's up?

851
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:05,728
That'll be quite enough.
Thank you so much.

852
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:07,770
See, the thing is,
we just opened up around here,

853
00:46:07,857 --> 00:46:09,020
you know what I'm saying?

854
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:11,564
And we've been having
some problems, obviously, as you see.

855
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:13,230
I appreciate what y'all did

856
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:15,609
'cause these cockroaches
would've cleaned me out.

857
00:46:15,698 --> 00:46:17,987
Speaking of cockroaches,
where was your antennas

858
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,483
when them niggas were stealing
my shit out the store?

859
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,495
- I didn't see them take anything.
- You didn't see 'em take anything.

860
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,621
Well, look next time! Use your eyes!

861
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:29,373
They ain't supposed to just be hazel,
they supposed to do some damn work!

862
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:31,668
This ain't for play.
I don't do this for fun.

863
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:32,835
I'm sorry.

864
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:36,708
Don't be sorry.
Ho, be careful! Lord Je--

865
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:38,083
You know what?

866
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:40,255
I'm tired of your presence. Dismissed.

867
00:46:40,348 --> 00:46:42,139
Nice meeting you guys.

868
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:43,802
See you later.

869
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:47,474
You got her trained, nigga, damn!

870
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:50,767
You can lead a ho to water, player,
but you can't make 'em think.

871
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:52,103
You dig what I'm sayin'?

872
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:53,853
I got to keep it
breezy around this bitch.

873
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,569
Anyway, I need to take care of y'all.

874
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:57,363
I appreciate
what y'all did for a player.

875
00:46:57,448 --> 00:46:59,156
I can't be everywhere at all times.

876
00:46:59,241 --> 00:47:00,273
No charge.

877
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:02,076
- What about our rent money?
- No charge.

878
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:03,786
Y'all sure?

879
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:07,075
Positive. We just doing our job.
We can't charge you, man.

880
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,577
Don't argue with ''no charge.''

881
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:10,459
You can come to the store
anytime you want.

882
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:13,083
Can we get some clothes,
30% off, 40% off?

883
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:15,414
- A FUBU short set?
- You don't need shit.

884
00:47:15,508 --> 00:47:17,168
Man.

885
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,833
Look, we just having a little
Christmas party tonight.

886
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:23,132
Why don't you and your lady come or
hang out with us and our folks?

887
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:25,133
Let me check my Palm Pilot.

888
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:27,804
Look like I ain't doin' shit.

889
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:29,010
Bring a bunch of bitches--

890
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:31,856
I'm talking about
a busload of them hos if you can.

891
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:35,144
I was gonna get drunk and watch
The Grinch. so I'll be there.

892
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:37,857
I'll get the address from y'all later.
I'll see you later, too.

893
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,655
Yo, yo, player, hold up.

894
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,283
Never know
what I might need this for.

895
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:44,368
Might want to shave.
Might want to shave somebody else!

896
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:45,996
Never know.

897
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,784
I like that nigga! I like him!

898
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,710
Look, that's real pimpin'.
Now, that's pimpin'.

899
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:53,751
Get off his dick, Day-Day.

900
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:56,672
What do you want
for Christmas, young fella?

901
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:59,877
I want a X-Box with all the games,
all the new gear,

902
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:02,341
a new Lexus
with a banging system

903
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,972
and chrome feet on it.

904
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,389
Here's my address, Mr. Jones.

905
00:48:07,477 --> 00:48:09,553
Mr. Jones?

906
00:48:09,645 --> 00:48:11,685
No, Santa.

907
00:48:11,772 --> 00:48:14,061
- I'm Santa.
- Bullshit! You Mr. Jones.

908
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:17,104
I know where you live, too,
so I expect everything by tomorrow.

909
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:18,226
You feel me?

910
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,729
Put everything in my mom's name.

911
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:23,196
He don't look like no reindeer,
he look like a pit bull.

912
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:24,743
Giddy-up, pit bull.

913
00:48:24,827 --> 00:48:28,611
You better stop jumping up and down
before I have to bite your little ass.

914
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:30,995
Can you lock your jaws
and shake like a pit bull?

915
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,076
Yeah. Want me to show you?

916
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:35,920
My brother said if a pit bull
locks his jaws like that,

917
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:38,128
you're supposed to do this to him...

918
00:48:40,676 --> 00:48:43,428
I didn't have to take anything.
lt was all her. Come on, man.

919
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:45,470
Take her! Let me go! Come on!

920
00:48:47,266 --> 00:48:50,054
- Later, Moly.
- Okay, buddy, take care.

921
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:51,887
A-Team!

922
00:48:52,855 --> 00:48:55,773
# Bad boys!
What you gonna do? #

923
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:57,898
Dodo! Good job, buddy.

924
00:48:57,985 --> 00:48:59,645
- Thanks.
- You, too, Clyde.

925
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:02,655
- Take lunch, one half-hour.
- That's cool right there.

926
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,234
Don't be late.

927
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:08,446
That's a dirty motherfucker.

928
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:10,447
He blowin' smoke in our face
on the first arrest?

929
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,619
That's bullshit.

930
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:14,245
I told you there ain't no future
in being a company man.

931
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:16,826
- Let's just go to lunch.
- Let's go. I'm hungry.

932
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:19,755
Ain't that...

933
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:22,213
Get them niggas! Come on, sugars!

934

00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:35,786
Pimping ain't easy but--

951
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:36,906
No!

00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:40,497
Get your fake ass out of my way!

954
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:43,043
Oh, this is bullshit.

955
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:45,291
I'm in between
a pimp and a hard place.

956
00:50:46,552 --> 00:50:51,464
Donna! Man down!
1 1-30! Pimp in distress!

957
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:53,135
Oh, Lord, where the hell is Donna?

958
00:50:53,226 --> 00:50:55,432
- Can I help you?
- Yo, move!

959
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,975

- What's your problem? Move!

960
00:50:58,064 --> 00:51:00,222
- I can't let you back there.
- Why? Who back there?

961
00:51:00,316 --> 00:51:01,395
Did you hear me?!

962
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:04,057
Go, go, go!

963
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:11,774

Let's jump. Let's jump.

970
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:54,986
Yo, Moly! I heard

971
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,202
that's been harassing
my grandmother and things.

972
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,488
Two new guys--Clyde and Dodo.

973
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,287
You remember what we did
to the last security guards?

974
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:03,286
Yes, I do, buddy.

975
00:52:03,379 --> 00:52:07,329
When you see them,
you tell them we said this...

976
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:09,998
Help! Somebody, help me!
Help me, please!

977
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:11,802
Somebody, help me, please!

978
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:15,881
Did you see
what they just did to Moly?

979
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:17,968
They gonna kick our ass
when they catch us.

980
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,136
That's why
they ain't gonna catch us.

981
00:52:24,025 --> 00:52:25,649
Where them rent-a-cops at, huh?

982
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,070
What you looking at, old man?
Mind your own fuckin' business.

983
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:33,612
Come on. Let's just jump
on Moly's car.

984
00:52:33,701 --> 00:52:35,195
Craig, I'm scared, man.

985
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:37,859
So what? Me, too.

986
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:41,948
Oh, fuck this.

987
00:52:42,043 --> 00:52:45,079
I'm not about to get my motherfuckin'
ass kicked over no job!

988
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:47,329
You smart as a motherfucker today.

989
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:50,002
Shit.

990
00:52:51,427 --> 00:52:52,708
This way.

991
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,923
Oh, shit!

992
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:00,885
Wow! Oh, my God!

993
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:02,722
Damn!

994

996
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:13,072
Oh, good observation, buddy.
Where were you, buddy, huh?

997
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:14,782
We was on our lunch break.

998
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:17,785
Trying to get something to eat
so we could secure this nasty-ass lot.

999
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,112
Good, you were eating
while I was getting beating.

1000
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:22,779
Look like somebody beat the bricks
off your motherfucking ass.

1001
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,535
You're supposed to be
security guard, no?

1002
00:53:24,627 --> 00:53:26,335
We are security. Ain't that a bitch?

1003
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,081
We are security guards.

1004
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:30,799
Oh, no, not anymore.
You're both fired.

1005
00:53:30,883 --> 00:53:32,294
Oh, man!

1006
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:33,713
Man, what the fuck?

1007
00:53:33,803 --> 00:53:35,048
Oh, hell, no!

1008
00:53:35,138 --> 00:53:37,925
We just got this job!
How you gonna fire us?

1009
00:53:38,016 --> 00:53:41,016

I don't know. I'm not
even in the spirit no more.

1030
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,406
Don't let nobody ever take

00:57:42,885 --> 00:57:44,083
We miss you down there!

1092
00:57:44,178 --> 00:57:46,254
Man, I know y'all do.
Why'd you fire me, Pink?

1093
00:57:46,347 --> 00:57:49,348
I had to! You was always late, fool!

1094
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:50,631
Say it again!

1095
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:51,883
Say it again!

1096
00:58:00,403 --> 00:58:02,146
Damn, girl, you eating again?

1097
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:08,278
What's up O.G., triple O.G.?

1098
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:10,492
- What's up?
- How you doing, man?

1099
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,694
Everything all right?

1100
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:13,616
- I'm cool, dawg.
- Good.

1101
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:17,622
Got my shank in case
shit jump off in this motherfucker.

1102
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:20,203
Relax, homey, ain't nothin'
about to jump off in here.

1103
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:22,540
That's my people, man!
That's my folks.

1104
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,626
My grandma, my uncle.

1105
00:58:27,346 --> 00:58:29,920
What you need to do, man,
is grab one of these females

1106
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:31,427
and get your boogie on.

1107
00:58:31,517 --> 00:58:33,806
I don't want to dance
with none of these hos.

1108
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:35,140
You're a fool.

1109
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:39,557
Ooh, what's up?

1110
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,477
Merry Christmas.

1111
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:42,814
Who is that?

1112
00:58:42,904 --> 00:58:44,149
How are you?

1113
00:58:44,238 --> 00:58:45,732
Oh, I'm all right.

1114
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:46,854
You look great.

1115
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:50,484
That's, uh, that's Donna.

1116
00:58:50,578 --> 00:58:52,321
You the greenest
little troll I ever seen!

1117
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:54,739
Who the nigga she with?

1118
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,374
That's just Money Mike.

1119
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:59,875
Little Lucky Charms,
little micro-mini pimp.

1120
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:02,584
Oh, that nigga look
magically delicious, nigga.

1121
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,251
That's right.

1122
00:59:04,342 --> 00:59:05,456
Perm and shit.

1123
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:07,046
Craig, look who here!

1124
00:59:07,136 --> 00:59:09,923
Yeah, bring him over here.
Bring his ass right here.

1125
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:12,470
Oh, man, thanks
for coming through, man.

1126
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:14,218
I appreciate that.

1127
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,935
No problem.
Thanks for inviting us.

1128
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,436
We had to show y'all some love
after what y'all did for us at the store.

1129
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:21,148
Don't she look good?

1130
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:23,107
lntroduce me to your friend, Craig.

1131
00:59:23,194 --> 00:59:26,645
Oh, that's Money Mike.

1132
00:59:26,739 --> 00:59:28,399
- That's Donna.
- Hi. Merry Christmas.

1133
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:30,982
This Damon. He live downstairs.

1134
00:59:32,537 --> 00:59:35,206
That was like The Matrix!

1135
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:37,959
Got some testosterone problems.

1136
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:40,711
Why don't you go get me
something to drink, please?

1137
00:59:40,795 --> 00:59:42,123
Thank you.

1138
00:59:42,213 --> 00:59:44,170
- Where is it?
- Right through here.

1139
00:59:46,509 --> 00:59:47,540
No, no.

1140
00:59:50,388 --> 00:59:52,926
Like to dislocated my shoulder.

1141
00:59:53,015 --> 00:59:56,100
Yo, homey, you ever been to the pen?

1142
00:59:56,185 --> 01:00:01,310
Hell, no, but thanks for asking.
Won't bother asking you, though.

1143
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:04,316
- Uh, Craig?
- Yeah.

1144
01:00:04,402 --> 01:00:05,730
Where your bathroom at, player?

1145
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,563
I got to piss
like a Russian racehorse

1146
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:10,111
at the Kentucky Derby
with a glue truck behind him.

1147
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:14,995
Yo, it's right through there.

1148
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:17,570
I got to pee diddy! About to get it on.

1149
01:00:17,665 --> 01:00:19,872
Hey, don't piss on the seat.

1150
01:00:29,677 --> 01:00:31,966
What's up, O.G., triple O.G.?

1151
01:00:32,054 --> 01:00:33,679
You got that look in your eye.

1152
01:00:33,765 --> 01:00:35,887
Fresh fish on the line, nigga.

1153
01:00:35,975 --> 01:00:37,932
Ain't nothin' like that shit.

1154
01:00:41,522 --> 01:00:43,847
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

1155
01:00:45,026 --> 01:00:48,561
Have to drink a little bit more water.
Smell like ammonia in this bitch.

1156
01:00:48,655 --> 01:00:50,314
Come on. There you go.

1157
01:00:52,158 --> 01:00:54,945
One at a time, player, one at a time.

1158
01:00:55,036 --> 01:00:56,696
Busy right now,
working with a monster.

1159
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:58,496
You know what this is, new booty!

1160
01:00:58,581 --> 01:01:00,455
- New booty?
- Don't fight the shit.

1161
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,036
- Fight what shit?
- Let it happen.

1162
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:04,249
Let what happen?
What the hell you doing?

1163
01:01:04,337 --> 01:01:06,828
Phone books? Nigga,
I ain't even in the phone book.

1164
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:10,339
This ain't funny, nigga.
I'll bitch-slap your ass.

1165
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:11,707
Come on, I ain't playin'.

1166
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:14,293
No!

1167
01:01:15,598 --> 01:01:18,469
Here's my card right here
if y'all ever want to be pimped.

1168
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,674
Day-Day.

1169
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:22,805
Better not let Pinky see that shit.
We ought to give it to him, though.

1170
01:01:22,897 --> 01:01:24,475
That's a barbecue card.

1171
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:27,519
Don't give a fuck. That's where
I'm pimping, out of the barbecue place.

1172
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:30,979
Come and get
barbecue-slapped. Shit.

1173
01:01:33,032 --> 01:01:35,488
Sneaky son of a bitch.

1174
01:01:35,576 --> 01:01:37,450
Damn, he's been
in there a long time.

1175
01:01:37,537 --> 01:01:38,995
I told you he was sick.

1176
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,286
He might be in there
throwing up anything.

1177
01:01:41,374 --> 01:01:43,034
Why don't we just step in here?

1178
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:44,952
We can sit down
and wait for him in here.

1179
01:01:46,295 --> 01:01:47,754
All right.

1180
01:01:57,348 --> 01:02:00,764
You got a nice room here.
Pretty clean for a bachelor.

1181
01:02:00,852 --> 01:02:04,434
I got a nice bed, too.
Wanna try it?

1182
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:07,309
- You funny, huh?
- I'm not trying to be funny.

1183
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,436
I'm trying to spread
a little holiday cheer,

1184
01:02:10,528 --> 01:02:13,019
get close to you.

1185
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:18,534
So, what brings you to California

1186
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:21,704
with this little
half-a-Prince motherfucker?

1187
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:23,865
You know, I ask myself
that same question.

1188
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:26,829
What am I doing way out here,

1189
01:02:26,919 --> 01:02:32,044
away from my family
this time of year?

1190
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:35,003
But it's just hard.

1191
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:37,502
Shit, just leave.

1192
01:02:37,597 --> 01:02:40,088
You don't understand.
lt's not that easy.

1193
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:44,013
I mean, he got you
all the way out here

1194
01:02:44,103 --> 01:02:47,686
so he can, you know,
mistreat you,

1195
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:49,565
do all them things to you--

1196
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,939
you know, I want
to do some things to you

1197
01:02:52,028 --> 01:02:53,937
that, um...

1198
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:57,480
You sure you don't want
to just, like, lean back?

1199
01:02:57,575 --> 01:02:59,781
What you think?

1200
01:03:02,747 --> 01:03:04,027
No!

1201
01:03:04,123 --> 01:03:05,451
Don't do it!

1202
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:06,870
You got some condoms?

1203
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:09,166
Day-Day, get the hell out of here!

1204
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:11,875
You know damn well you got
all the rubbers in your--

1205
01:03:11,964 --> 01:03:14,800
Get the fuck out of here!

1206
01:03:14,884 --> 01:03:16,675
She liked me anyway, didn't you?

1207
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:19,002
You're a trip.

1208
01:03:19,097 --> 01:03:21,588
You know what? Don't pay
no attention to Day-Day.

1209
01:03:21,683 --> 01:03:24,138
- That boy, he just a fool.
- You know what?

1210
01:03:24,227 --> 01:03:27,181
Let's just go before
Mike comes busting in on us.

1211
01:03:28,189 --> 01:03:32,056
And, Craig, a word of advice--
you should get a lock on this door.

1212
01:03:34,028 --> 01:03:36,068
I ain't never gonna get no pussy.

1213
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:39,949
What if I tried to get
a lock right now and just--

1214
01:03:41,786 --> 01:03:43,066
All right. God!

1215
01:03:44,163 --> 01:03:46,833
- Come on out of there!
- Pop, what's the matter?

1216
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:48,197
Who's in the bathroom?

1217
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:50,083
That eggnog about
to kick back up on me.

1218
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:51,450
You know I got them bad guts.

1219
01:03:51,546 --> 01:03:53,787
Man, Pops gotta boo-boo, come on!

1220
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:55,506
Don't tell everybody!

1221
01:03:55,592 --> 01:03:57,133
Hey, you know what?

1222
01:03:57,218 --> 01:03:59,590
The lady will let you
use it downstairs, the landlady.

1223
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:00,710
Miss Pearly.

1224
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:03,047
Go on down. She'll let you use it.

1225
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:04,968
Come on out of there, man!

1226
01:04:07,395 --> 01:04:08,854
Honey, where you going?

1227
01:04:08,938 --> 01:04:11,227
I'll be right back. Oh, boy!

1228
01:04:34,255 --> 01:04:36,331
All right!

1229
01:04:37,425 --> 01:04:39,002
All right!

1230
01:04:39,093 --> 01:04:42,129
I'm Craig's daddy--Willie Jones.

1231
01:04:42,221 --> 01:04:44,843
As you know, we're having
a little get-together upstairs,

1232
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:47,055
and the bathrooms are jammed.

1233
01:04:47,143 --> 01:04:48,851
I like the way you got that lined up.

1234
01:04:48,936 --> 01:04:50,561
Mind if I use yours?

1235
01:04:50,771 --> 01:04:52,052
No. Come on in.

1236
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:54,354
- Where's it at?
- Down the hall.

1237
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:55,853
Thank you.

1238
01:05:00,406 --> 01:05:02,233
All right, there we go.

1239
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:07,532
There we go. About time.

1240
01:05:07,622 --> 01:05:09,947
Oh, just what I needed so bad.

1241
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:14,079
Yeah, there it is.

1242
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:22,875
How you doing?

1243
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,640
Show me what you working with.

1244
01:05:25,723 --> 01:05:28,048
- Oh, damn!
- What's wrong with you, fool?

1245
01:05:28,142 --> 01:05:29,850
That's my woman you're dancing with.

1246
01:05:29,936 --> 01:05:31,809
Hey, fool, your woman's
freaking with me!

1247
01:05:31,896 --> 01:05:33,307
I bought them titties!

1248
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,643
What's wrong with you?

1249
01:05:34,899 --> 01:05:36,441
I'll bust a cap right in your fat ass.

1250
01:05:36,525 --> 01:05:37,770
Don't mess up the party, Elroy.

1251
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,778
Dance with me, dance with me.
Come on, dance with me.

1252
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:48,243
Did you pee on me?

1253
01:05:48,329 --> 01:05:51,449
Wake your bitch-ass up,
Lucky Charms.

1254
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:54,031
I like my fish wet and squirmy.

1255
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:57,460
I thought I was dreaming.
You almost drowned me, nigga.

1256
01:05:57,547 --> 01:06:00,002
Oh, you dreaming. This a wet dream.

1257
01:06:00,091 --> 01:06:02,463
Wet dream?
Wait a minute, I'm a pimp!

1258
01:06:02,552 --> 01:06:04,628
You lost your mind? What the hell?!

1259
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,800
Am I in prison?

1260
01:06:05,888 --> 01:06:07,797
Donna! Pimp down!

1261
01:06:10,726 --> 01:06:13,348
You got a lot of balls!

1262
01:06:14,855 --> 01:06:18,556
Pimpin', pimpin', pimpin'!

1263
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,105
You was just gonna take it,
wasn't you? Hmm?

1264
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:27,156
You thought I was
play-pimping, didn't you?

1265
01:06:27,243 --> 01:06:28,986
Yeah, okay, okay.

1266
01:06:32,582 --> 01:06:34,491
- Could you just let me go?
- Say something.

1267
01:06:34,584 --> 01:06:37,253
I was just playing with you.

1268
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:39,329
I was playing with you, dawg.

1269
01:06:39,422 --> 01:06:40,964
I was playing, man, okay?

1270
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:43,337
I'm a nice guy
when you get to know me.

1271
01:06:43,426 --> 01:06:46,296
Shut up! What the hell
you talking about?

1272
01:06:46,387 --> 01:06:49,174
I am a boy!

1273
01:06:49,265 --> 01:06:53,097
You are not in prison
anymore, Damon!

1274
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:55,012
That's not how we do it!

1275
01:06:56,772 --> 01:07:00,556
Say, noog! This is Pinky, noogah!
Look, I got to go pee-pee!

1276
01:07:00,651 --> 01:07:03,771
Uh, Damon, are you a music lover?

1277
01:07:03,863 --> 01:07:06,484
You are? Good. Have you
ever heard of The Nutcracker?

1278
01:07:06,574 --> 01:07:08,816
Oh, shit!

1279
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,487
Have you, huh? Have you heard it?

1280
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:11,906
Huh? Huh?

1281
01:07:11,996 --> 01:07:14,487
Yes. Yes.

1282
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:19,708
# Crunching on your balls
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

1283
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,210
Mom, what's the matter?

1284
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:27,543
Where did your father go?

1285
01:07:27,637 --> 01:07:29,843
He just went downstairs
to use the bathroom

1286
01:07:29,931 --> 01:07:31,840
over at Miss Pearly's, the landlady.

1287
01:07:31,933 --> 01:07:36,310
Oh, Miss Pearly. Hmm...

1288
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:37,593
Excuse me.

1289
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:42,223
Mama.

1290
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:45,027
Oh, shit!

1291
01:07:45,113 --> 01:07:46,275
Hey!

1292
01:07:48,157 --> 01:07:51,277
Should be a law against
people with guts like mine.

1293
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:53,907
That was a monster--
Why it so dark in here, baby?

1294
01:07:53,996 --> 01:07:55,870
What are you about to do,
pray or something?

1295
01:07:55,957 --> 01:07:58,198
Did your son tell you I said hi?

1296
01:08:00,294 --> 01:08:02,086
No. Pertaining to what?

1297
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:04,958
Your son Craig
ain't paid his rent this month,

1298
01:08:05,049 --> 01:08:08,169
and I'm about to throw him
out on his ass tomorrow.

1299
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,716
So how much do you
really love your boy?

1300
01:08:10,805 --> 01:08:14,387
Not enough to pay his fucking rent.
I have enough trouble paying my own!

1301
01:08:14,475 --> 01:08:17,310
I'm not talking about rent,
Willie Jones.

1302
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:19,553
Well, what you talking about,
Miss Pearly?

1303
01:08:19,647 --> 01:08:21,770
I'm talking about these nuts!

1304
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:26,477
You're gonna give me
some of this dick today!

1305
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:28,362
I don't even know you, woman!

1306
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:30,274
I heard they call you
''Sweet-Dick Willie.''

1307
01:08:30,366 --> 01:08:31,564
- Who, me?
- Yeah!

1308
01:08:31,659 --> 01:08:33,402
- You heard that, huh?
- Yeah.

1309
01:08:33,494 --> 01:08:35,452
Yes, baby, I'm a bad mother.

1310
01:08:35,538 --> 01:08:39,037
- Can I have some of it?
- Let me go, woman! Hell, no!

1311
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,239
I don't know you, woman!

1312
01:08:40,334 --> 01:08:41,745
Oh, Sweet-Dick Willie!

1313
01:08:41,836 --> 01:08:44,161
Willie, get your ass off that heifer!

1314
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:47,622
Daddy, get your ass off that heifer!

1315
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:52,587
Yeah, pimping!

1316
01:08:54,932 --> 01:08:57,684
That's right.

1317
01:08:57,769 --> 01:08:59,892
Hey, I want everybody back!

1318
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:02,387
There's gonna be
ball juice everywhere!

1319
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:04,308
Everybody get back!

1320
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,729
Get back in the house!

1321
01:09:07,361 --> 01:09:09,817
Don't take anybody!

1322
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:12,698
Y'all get the hell
out of my house!

1323
01:09:12,784 --> 01:09:14,657
My dick wouldn't get hard!

1324
01:09:14,744 --> 01:09:16,535
Whip his ass, Mama!

1325
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:19,194
Miss Pearly, you ain't right,
trying to give my daddy V.D.

1326
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,283
I'm calling the police on y'all, fool!

1327
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,617
Well, get that lined up,
too, first, bitch!

1328
01:09:23,711 --> 01:09:25,040
Go to hell!

1329
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:28,213
Player. Player!

1330
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:29,378
What's going on?

1331
01:09:29,467 --> 01:09:30,546
Ain't nothin', player.

1332
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:32,592
Thanks for inviting me. I appreciate it.

1333
01:09:32,678 --> 01:09:33,758
Donna, get the car.

1334
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:35,340
Come on, player.

1335
01:09:35,431 --> 01:09:37,139
Hey, them my vise grips, man!

1336
01:09:37,225 --> 01:09:40,843
Yeah, that's his nuts, too.
You can have them both back!

1337
01:09:40,937 --> 01:09:42,680
Look, I'm just saying, man,

1338
01:09:42,772 --> 01:09:44,764
let him go, and there
won't be no hard feelings.

1339
01:09:44,857 --> 01:09:45,937
No hard feelings?

1340
01:09:46,025 --> 01:09:48,018
Have you ever seen
a rottweiler bite a chihuahua?

1341
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,486
No.

1342
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:52,144
Me, neither, but it
ain't pretty, I'm sure of it.

1343
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,983
Now you hold on
till I get in the car.

1344
01:09:54,075 --> 01:09:58,322
Dude, I'm not about to touch
his nuts or them vise grips.

1345
01:09:58,413 --> 01:10:00,535
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1346
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:02,663
- Yes, you are!
- Bullshit.

1347
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,909
You invited me to this party,
ain't that right?

1348
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:07,672
That's right. Whatever
y'all do, make it quick.

1349
01:10:07,755 --> 01:10:09,795
I think I'm gonna pass out.

1350
01:10:09,882 --> 01:10:10,961
No, no, no--

1351
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,671
lt's your party, your pliers,
his nuts in your hand.

1352
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:16,217
That's how it's going.
Donna, get the door.

1353
01:10:16,305 --> 01:10:18,179
I'll get the car door.

1354
01:10:19,434 --> 01:10:21,759
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

1355
01:10:21,853 --> 01:10:23,892
Yeah.

1356
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,854
I'll call you.

1357
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:28,063
Hold on.

1358
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:30,522
[SlLENTLY] Call me.

1359
01:10:30,611 --> 01:10:31,726
- Hey!
- What?!

1360
01:10:31,821 --> 01:10:33,730
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah.

1361
01:10:33,823 --> 01:10:35,400
Get these pliers!

1362
01:10:35,491 --> 01:10:36,950
All right. You ready?

1363
01:10:37,035 --> 01:10:38,315
I'm ready. I'm ready.

1364
01:10:38,411 --> 01:10:40,035
- You ready?
- Oh, I'm ready, player.

1365
01:10:40,121 --> 01:10:41,995
On the count of three--

1366
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:44,240
- Here we go. One...
- On your balls...

1367
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:45,744
- Two...
- Grab a handful...

1368
01:10:45,835 --> 01:10:47,578
- Three!
- Go!

1369
01:10:48,754 --> 01:10:50,213
Hey!

1370
01:10:50,298 --> 01:10:54,165
Donna, you can't leave me!
Hey, pimp in distress!

1371
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,299
Bitch, I ain't--hold on!

1372
01:10:56,387 --> 01:10:58,925
How the fuck
you gonna leave me?!

1373
01:10:59,015 --> 01:11:01,173
He gonna fuck the lining
out of Little Prince.

1374
01:11:01,267 --> 01:11:04,967
Code 1 1-32--pimp missing!

1375
01:11:09,191 --> 01:11:10,223
What?

1376
01:11:10,318 --> 01:11:11,812
You see that mother?

1377
01:11:11,903 --> 01:11:13,812
That-that's--

1378
01:11:13,905 --> 01:11:16,574
He the one
broke in the apartment!

1379
01:11:34,217 --> 01:11:35,248
You see him?

1380
01:11:35,342 --> 01:11:37,501
Yeah, he just went
through there on the side.

1381
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:49,104
- You ready?
- I'm not going in there, man.

1382
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:52,274
Stop being so scary.
All our stuff might be in there.

1383
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,981
Why you always
got to be a hero, man?

1384
01:11:55,071 --> 01:11:56,269
Take your--go over there.

1385
01:11:56,364 --> 01:11:59,116
I bet something bite you in the ass.
I'm not going.

1386
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,406
No, I don't want
to get bit in the ass.

1387
01:12:01,494 --> 01:12:03,949
Ten more minutes before Christmas.

1388
01:12:04,038 --> 01:12:07,372
Ten more minutes.
That's what I'm talking about.

1389
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:12,120
Lord have mercy,
I'm tired as a runaway slave.

1390
01:12:12,213 --> 01:12:13,837
Let's see what I got.

1391
01:12:13,923 --> 01:12:16,046
Don't nobody get me nothin', anyway.

1392
01:12:18,011 --> 01:12:19,754
Oh, snap.

1393
01:12:19,846 --> 01:12:22,052
Dada.
I always wanted me a Dada.

1394
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,847
Hell, yeah.

1395
01:12:23,933 --> 01:12:26,768
Extra medium?
Extra medium?

1396
01:12:26,853 --> 01:12:29,889
Hell, got to have something
for the skinny niggas.

1397
01:12:29,981 --> 01:12:32,768
Day-Day, this could be
our last chance.

1398
01:12:32,858 --> 01:12:35,979
You keep your timid ass here.
I'm going to get my shit.

1399
01:12:38,614 --> 01:12:41,188
Yeah, I roll to the club
just like this, baby.

1400
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:44,487
Santa Claus up here,
grabbing me some wallets,

1401
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:47,414
cigarette lighters, some car keys.

1479
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:25,243
I'm glad we got
our rent money back, baby.

1480
01:18:25,336 --> 01:18:26,960
What are we gonna do
with that fool?

1481
01:18:27,046 --> 01:18:29,418
I don't know. Po-pos will get
his dumb ass sooner or later.

1482
01:18:29,507 --> 01:18:32,627
Ho ho ho, motherfucker!

1483
01:18:32,718 --> 01:18:34,296
There you have it.

1484
01:18:34,387 --> 01:18:37,720
Another Friday gone.

1485
01:18:39,058 --> 01:18:40,802
Wejust took oun stuff
back to the panty

1486
01:18:40,893 --> 01:18:44,013
and left Santa Claus on the roof
for the police to get.

1487
01:18:44,105 --> 01:18:48,731

1488
01:18:48,818 --> 01:18:52,104
Pimp down!

1489
01:18:52,196 --> 01:18:53,477
And Money Mike.

1490
01:18:53,573 --> 01:18:55,482

getting chased by Damon

1491
01:18:55,575 --> 01:18:57,069
all through the 'hood.

1492
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,160
There's a loud party upstairs
that's keeping me up.

1493
01:19:00,246 --> 01:19:02,488
Could you please send a unit?

1494
01:19:02,582 --> 01:19:04,658
Miss Peanly kept on hating on us.

1495
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:07,538
We didn't even cane.
We kept on partying.

1496
01:19:07,628 --> 01:19:10,084
My uncle got drunk
and eventually passed out.

1497
01:19:10,172 --> 01:19:11,833
And look at Pops--

1498
01:19:11,924 --> 01:19:15,174
You know. he showed his ass
till the po-pos came.

1499
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:19,472
- Open the door! Let's do this!
- Put down the b-b-b-b-barbecue.

1500
01:19:19,557 --> 01:19:21,348
But all they wanted
was some mone weed.

1501
01:19:21,434 --> 01:19:22,714
So we looked them up.

1502
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:26,559
and I even kept
Day-Day's dumb ass occupied.

1503
01:19:26,647 --> 01:19:28,142
And a German shepherd mix!

1504
01:19:31,318 --> 01:19:33,856
That's till
my moms walked in on him.

1505
01:19:33,946 --> 01:19:37,280
And me. you know how a player do.

1506
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:39,573
I convinced Donna
to bring her fine ass

1507
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,119
back to the panty.

1508
01:19:41,203 --> 01:19:42,698
got her in my room.

1509
01:19:42,788 --> 01:19:44,911
slid the dresser
in fnont of the door.

1510
01:19:44,999 --> 01:19:47,621
and got myself
an early Christmas present.

1511
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:49,703
You know!

1512
01:19:55,134 --> 01:19:57,292
I'll beat-box your ass!

1513
01:19:57,805 --> 01:20:04,160
