1
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:19,729
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house,

2
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:25,358
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

3
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:09,047
Goddamn, Day-Day.

4
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:14,842
Take it all.
One, two, get up, three.

5
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,804
That's what I'm talkin' about.

6
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,817
Damn! That's an ugly-ass baby.
Eyes cocked like a pistol.

7
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,288
All I want, Santa Claus,
is two fat bitches and a bag of weed

8
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:41,707
and two bags of chips
to give to the fat bitches.

9
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,541
What the...

10
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,622
Damn, these niggas are broke.

11
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:50,582
No Christmas ham in here. Nothing.

12
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,420
lt's a damn shame.

13
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,920
All l want is two fat bitches
and some cheeseburgers

14
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:56,806
so Cheeco can lick on them

15
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:59,015
and two years' supply
of rolling paper.

16
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:01,723
Two pieces of bologna. Yeah, baby.

17
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:05,147
This gonna be good right here.
I'm so hungry.

18
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,734
What the hell
you doin' in my house

19
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,528
eatin' a big-ass sandwich and shit?

20
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:13,021
Nigga, I'm Santa Claus.
Where's the milk and cookies?

21
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:14,694
Santa Claus!

22
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:15,983
Shit!

23
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,319
You better get your ass outta here!

24
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:19,528
Goddamn!

25
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:21,283
Day-Day! Day-Day!

26
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:43,225
All I want is a fat bitch with
a name belt that say ''Glitter'' on it.

27
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,767
Day-Day! Help me, man!

28
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:01,448
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

29
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,719
As you can see.

30
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:18,342
I got my black ass
back in the ghetto.

31
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,804
the only place
where you can get robbed

32
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:23,051
by Santa Claus
on Chistmas Eve.

33
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:24,259
Shit!

34
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:27,688
I don't know if I can handle
another goddamn Friday.

35
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,149
This shit hurt.

36
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:33,396
Day-Day! Wake up, man!
We just got robbed!

37
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:36,938
Get your scary ass up, man!
I know you heard that shit!

38
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:39,571
Get out of here, man!

39
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,244
Wake your ass up!

40
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,157
Come on, man,
I gotta call the po-po!

41
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:49,043
What you say? Damn.

42
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:51,547
We just got robbed, Cheeco.

43
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:07,069
Unit 415. man
in the middle of the street.

44
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,153
Then what happened?

45
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:12,282
Then I caught him.
I hit him, like, four times.

46
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:15,375
I would've been a boxer,
but I was in Special Education.

47
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,832
I'm telling you,
I was whooping his ass!

48
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,914
Craig got to fightin' with him,
he beat his ass.

49
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:21,666
- Go check out the bedrooms.
- Sure.

50
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:23,466
What else did he get?

51
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:27,055
Like I said,
he took all of our presents,

52
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:29,131
he took my CD collection,

53
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:32,557
he even took
Day-Day's baby pictures.

54
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:35,728
And he got our speaker
with all our rent money in it.

55
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:36,845
Rent money!

56
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,643
- Sit your ass down!
- Who got the rent money?!

57
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,487
You ain't about to do nothin'.

58
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:45,114
Jumpin' up like you Mr. Get Bad.

59
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,772
Where was you when he was
beatin' my ass with that tree?

60
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,537
- Craig, my leg is hurtin', man.
- Good!

61
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,657
Yeah, he got
the rent money. All of it.

62
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:56,286
You're positive he was dressed
like Santa Claus?

63
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,582
Jolly white fat guy,
little red suit,

64
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,505
couple elves packin' the bags.

65
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,132
He's a project Santa Claus.

66
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:05,886
Picture Ol' Dirty Bastard
in a Santa Claus suit.

67
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:07,546
Can you picture that?

68
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:10,307
Do you know who
Ol' Dirty Bastard is?

69
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,347
I'm not big on that.

70
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,391
You oughta be nervous.
You a black cop.

71
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:17,147
You two motherfuckers huddle up
or something and find this dude.

72
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,772
Stay right there.

73
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:20,347
I ain't goin' nowhere.

74
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,019
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

75
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,186
- You're gonna sit in the car.
- Do your fucking job!

76
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,738
You're pushing the wrong buttons.

77
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:27,649
We the victims, man.

78
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:30,825
That victim shit is way overblown.

79
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,033
Just sit there and shut up.

80
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,580
Asshole.

81
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:36,657
Santa Claus strikes again.

82
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,122
Makes me want to go home
and lock up all my shit.

83
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,250
You gotta stop talking
to the police like that.

84
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:43,377
Shut up! You better stop
talking to me like that.

85
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:45,920
I could kick your ass
for the way you actin' this morning.

86
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,551
We gonna have our Christmas party?

87
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:51,052
How we gonna have a party
with our apartment looking like this?

88
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,306
We can't cancel the party, man!
What about the hos we had coming?

89
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:56,052
I invited some nice-ass girls.

90
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:57,425
They gonna fuck for a buck,

91
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,430
do something strange
for a little piece of change,

92
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:01,978
and I know we gonna
make them holler for a dollar.

93
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,143
One said they was gonna
suck my dick from the back.

94
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,524
I ain't never had that
ever happen to me.

95
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:11,773
I'm trying to go see
what that be like right there--

96
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:14,953
Look, man, I don't give
a shit about you, that party.

97
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:16,532
All I got to worry about is the rent,

98
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:19,410
and it was your idea
to use half the rent money...

99
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:24,414
Dix, I think we got something here.

100
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,629
Well, well. Whose is this?

101
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:28,923
Actually, it's both of ours.

102
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,042
No, it ain't!

103
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:33,930
lt is, but it's for
medicinal uses only.

104
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:36,850
I mean, he got cataract,
lazy eye, a little glaucoma.

105
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:40,185
- See that eye right there?
- Little shot of gonorrhea, see?

106
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,845
Do you guys have any idea
what we could do to you for this?

107
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,313
- No.
- Juvenile center?

108
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:48,319
We can make your Christmas
worse than it already is.

109
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:49,519
Being that it's Friday,

110
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:52,319
that means you're not gonna
see a judge till possibly Monday.

111
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:53,488
Maybe.

112
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:57,111
But, since we're nice guys,
we'll just confiscate this plant,

113
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:59,779
take it with us until we find
this Santa Claus character.

114
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,867
That's fucked up, too.

115
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,451
Oh, hey,
and when we find St. Nick,

116
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:07,215
what do y'all want us
to do to him, you know?

117
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,917
Cracked ribs, fractured skull,
little eye gouge?

118
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,549
Fractured skull,
beat the shit out that motherfucker.

119
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,675
- Eye gouge, that's the shit.
- And an eye gouge.

120
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:19,720
I say stick a plunger in his ass,
like they did in New York.

121
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,887
Fractured skull.

122
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,598
This is Officer Brian Dix.
I'm Officer Alvin Hole.

123
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,435
We'll let you know
if anything develops.

124
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:30,647
Officer A. Hole and B. Dix.

125
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,114
We'll call you...

126
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,440
if we find anything.

127
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:37,528
I like them police right there.

128
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:43,366
You got a big pile of dog shit
in the middle of your bed.

129
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,915
You might want to check that out.

130
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:47,415
Merry Christmas.

131
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:50,835
He's the dick.

132
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:52,800
What the hell
is going on around here?!

133
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,380
Happy Holidays, Miss Pearly.

134
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:58,682
Police running in and out!
What the hell is going on?

135
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,721
Somebody broke in
and stole all our stuff.

136
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,222
That bullshit security.

137
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:05,851
I sure hope they
didn't get the rent money

138
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,514
'cause you two niggas
been ducking and dodging me

139
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,773
for about three weeks now.

140
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:10,892
Me--

141
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:15,530
Today is the day
you motherfuckers is gonna kick in!

142
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:18,571
Why you always bring your ass
up here harassing us?

143
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,156
With that big ol' wolf pussy?

144
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:22,535
You come here all the time
smelling like that.

145
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:25,293
- You don't even own the place!
- You just the manager.

146
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,793
And I'm gonna manage
to evict your skinny-punk black ass

147
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,415
out of here today if you two
motherfuckers don't pay up your rent.

148
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:34,715
Man, get that lined up.

149
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:37,376
Don't you worry about it, bitch.
I know somebody like it.

150
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:41,221
Take your ass back downstairs,
'cause you ain't evictin' nobody

151
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:43,432
unless you got
a motherfucking army with you.

152
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,019
I don't need no army, Mr. Smart-Ass!

153
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:49,514
My son Damon home right now.

154
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:50,688
Damon!

155
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:53,529
I had a nightmare
about that fool last night.

156
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,067
Day-Day!

157
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:57,735
Craig!

158
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,991
Which one of you bitches
want to wash my drawers tonight?

159
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,622
- That'd be him.
- Him.

160
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:06,572
Okay.

161
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:09,752
I wash on Sundays, anyway.

162
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:11,462
Starch or press?

163
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:13,042
Starch, nigga!

164
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,090
Move!

165
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:19,088
Come on in, Miss Pearly.

166
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,754
- When did he get out?
- Last night.

167
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:25,475
And I'm gonna let you two bitches
in on a little secret--

168
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:29,180
when you spend 12 years
on a level-4 prison yard,

169
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:33,437
you become quite fond
of little ol' girls like yourselves.

170
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:36,446
So either I'm gonna
get my rent money today,

171
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:39,781
or somebody getting
their salad tossed tonight!

172
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:40,899
Damn!

173
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,405
That ain't even necessary.

174
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:43,527
Sure ain't!

175
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,947
We start our new job today,

176
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,532
and I swear to God we're gonna
have your money later on tonight--

177
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,915
cash...in your hand!

178
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,249
You better!

179
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,416
Either you fixin' to come see me,
or Damon gonna come see you.

180
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,254
Simple as that.

181
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:01,422
You like 'cause your son is a fag?

182
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,341
Shut up, bitch!

183
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:09,262
Tell your fine daddy I said...

184
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:15,645
I hate that bitch!

185
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:18,145
Tight-ass pants, man! Shit!

186
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:21,815
Look how tight
these motherfucking pants are.

187
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,483
I can't even do
the James Brown in these pants.

188
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,536
Good. I don't want
to see you do the James Brown.

189
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:29,328
We ain't never gonna get
no pussy in these clothes.

190
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,662
I'm gonna get some.

191
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,709
Tasha, how we look?

192
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,124
Like a couple of rent-a-cops.

193
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:36,171
What about them rent-a-tits?

194
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,834
See, the clothes don't make the player,

195
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,755
the player make the clothes.

196
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,389
Rent-a-cops get pussy, too.

197
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:45,382
I'm not no rent-a-cop,
I'm a Top Flight Security

198
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:47,468
and don't you never forget it.

199
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:50,230
I swear, the first motherfucker
get out of hand...

200
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:52,389
- I'm gonna beat the--
- Shit!

201
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,107
Craig and Day-Day.

202
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:59,234
Just the niggas I need to see.

203
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,315
Yo, what's up, O.G., triple O.G.,

204
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:04,444
O.G. triple, triple...O.G.?

205
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,947
You got out last night?

206
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:08,244
I ain't seen y'all
in about 12 years, nigga.

207
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,039
I was little. I was about--

208
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,323
You're grown up now, though.

209
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:14,995
Give a nigga a hug, dawg.

210
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,709
I'm about to go--

211
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:23,716
lt's cool, dawg, it's cool. Come here.

212
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:25,504
Yeah, right there.

213
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,471
- Group hug, nigga.
- Come on, Craig.

214
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:31,802
All right, come here.

215
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,222
Get your ass over here.
Talk to you for a minute.

216
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,059
What's up, dawg?

217
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:37,728
lt's good to be home,

218
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,986
'cause in the prison, dawg,
ain't nothin' but the fellas, nigga.

219
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,361
- That's what I heard.
- I swear, man.

220
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,822
We got to care about each other.

221
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,239
That's right.

222
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,243
Somebody go get my mother!

223
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,661
I heard you motherfuckers
ain't paid your rent this month.

224
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,746
Ducking and dodging
my moms and shit!

225
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,208
Get your tittie off my chin!

226
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:03,751
Show up here tonight
without that rent money,

227
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,846
and we gonna get
real motherfucking acquainted.

228
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,011
You dig?

229
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,551
- I can't breathe, I swear to God!
- He can't breathe!

230
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:12,724
Do you dig?!

231
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:14,686
I'm feeling you, dawg. Trust me.

232
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,098
- Digging it.
- Good, good.

233
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,517
'Cause I'm gonna
only say this shit once.

234
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:22,029
Come on, man, let's go.

235
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,860
Y'all look good in your little
tight-ass rent-a-cop outfits.

236
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,239
Merry Christmas, niggettes.

237
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:32,160
Shit, man! That's bullshit, man.

238
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:35,084
He's gonna try and do
something strange to us!

239
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,912
I'm gonna think of something.

240
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,414
That's fucked up, man.

241
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:41,174
He might do something strange
to you, though.

242
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,930
Puff-puff and give, motherfucker.

243
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:52,803
This is good shit.
I ain't gonna be your mother--

244
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:54,851
- Damn!
- Hurry up!

245
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,366
About a yean ago.
my Pops quit his dog-catching job

246
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:12,370
and went into business
with my Uncle Elroy.

247
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:15,291
They opened up a spot
called Bros. Barb-B-Q.

248
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,329
''Tastes so good.
make you wanna slap youn mama. ''

249
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,293
You might've
seen the commencial.

250
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,953
Y'all tired of that barbecue
from up the street.

251
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,876
where they give you
more sauce than meat?

252
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,044
Bning youn big ass down
to Bros. Bar-B-Q.

253
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,842
15837 South Crenshaw Boulevard.

254
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,425
That's right off Manciesten.

255
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:35,181
Bros. Bar-B-Q. Tastes so good.
make you want to slap youn mama!

256
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,349
Don't it. Willie?

257
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,430
Yeah. boy. Hey. Mama.

258
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:39,934
What the hell you want?

259
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,814
Ain't but one location.
so it's nearest you.

260
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,363
You might've missed it.

261
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,939
They only had enough money
for a 15-second spot.

262
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,192
But. anyway. my Pops
got me and Day-Day

263
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:54,073
thesejobs
at the same strip mall

264
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:55,907
as Christmas-help security.

265
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:00,328
Look, Day-Day,
we only security guards, okay?

266
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,413
Ghetto security guards at that.

267
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:05,341
We ain't Cops.
we ain't America's Most Wanted.

268
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:08,545
NYPD Blue.
none of that shit you watch.

269
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:10,344
We something like them.

270
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,675
No. Nothing like it.

271
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:14,885
All we gonna do--take it easy,
make this money,

272
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,636
you're gonna watch your temper--

273
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:17,843
I ain't got to watch shit!

274
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:20,060
You gonna treat people right,
talk to people right.

275
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,437
You can get your ass kicked
around here real quick.

276
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:24,399
I don't care about it
getting out of hand.

277
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,562
I ain't getting into shit
because of you.

278
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:29,359
This is a job, man.
This ain't an adventure.

279
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,320
This is real, and I'm gonna
let you know, I'm not having it.

280
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,118
Everybody's a suspect today.

281
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:35,781
And I told you, I'm a player.

282
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,865
I don't care about none of that.

283
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,954
Damn!

284
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,249
Get your ass out, player.

285
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:43,617
Fuck, you remedial!

286
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:45,587
- What does that mean?
- Retarded!

287
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:48,295
- That wasn't nothing.
- Dumb-ass, let's go.

288
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:49,713
I mess up all the time.

289
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:57,762
Come here! Look!

290
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,979
- That's him!
- Let's get that mother!

291
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,777
Get him! Kick him!

292
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,367
- Craig! Day-Day!
- Uncle Willie!

293
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:16,864
What the hell you doing to me?

294
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,446
What's happening?

295
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,703
Man, I didn't know!

296
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,248
Pop, I thought
you were somebody else!

297
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:25,827
Willie, what are you doing
to them boys back there?

298
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:27,915
Nothing! I'm counting
money at the register.

299
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,131
These fools
knock the hell out of me...

300
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:33,883
We made a mistake. Day-Day
ran in and jumped on Daddy!

301
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,217
He's lying!

302
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,383
Why you boys
beating up on Santa Claus?

303
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,966
He broke in our house
and stole our presents.

304
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,635
- And Craig let him do it!
- Why, Craig?

305
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:45,518
- Why blame me?
- 'Cause you did!

306
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:47,317
I tried to fight him, and Day-Day...

307
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:49,395
I was screaming,
he wouldn't even help.

308
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:51,314
What did you do, Day-Day?

309
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,564
Nothing!
He stayed asleep the whole time.

310
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:55,034
Can I tell my story?

311
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:58,321
I ain't done shit, but he could have
did something about it!

312
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,038
What did he look like?

313
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:02,792
Like Bobby Brown
in a goddamned Santa Claus suit!

314
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,121
I heard about him.

315
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,544
They call him
the ''Santa Clause Crook.''

316
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,837
He robbed a lady
in the parking lot last week.

317
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,213
He called her
a ''ho ho ho'' and kept running.

318
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:13,796
Who the fuck are you?

319
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:18,715
I'm Cookie, the new waitress,
and, um...

320
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:21,726
Elroy's new girlfriend.

321
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:25,059
You got another one?
You're gonna catch something!

322
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:27,935
You should have kept
Sugar's nasty ass. What happened?

323
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,102
I kicked her country ass
to the curb.

324
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,437
Hooked up with her little sister.

325
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,404
That's how we players roll!

326
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:40,031
Elroy, read my lips--
you ain't no player!

327
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,743
You don't know nothing
about being a player.

328
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:47,329
Betty done had your ass
pussy-whipped for about 30 years!

329
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,662
Nobody got me pussy-whipped.

330
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:53,339
l...whips...pussy!

331
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,596
You boys look really good
with your rent-a-cop outfits on.

332
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:02,094
Yes, very attractive.

333
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:05,969
This is Top Flight Security.
We ain't no rent-a-cops.

334
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,558
Daddy, how I look?

335
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:11,145
- Like a damn snitch!
- Man, that's cold!

336
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,941
Look like you're ready
to tell on somebody right now!

337
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,568
Where's your flashlight at?
You're supposed to have one.

338
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,781
You've got to shine some damn body!

339
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:22,451
We're supposed to get handcuffs,
flashlights, taser guns--

340
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:23,737
Two German shepherds.

341
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:27,450
Y'all must not know what happened
to the last security guards.

342
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:32,214
Mama's in the kitchen with the sauce.

343
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,090
Aw, shit! The sauce! Move, girl!

344
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,215
What happened
to the other two sec--

345
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:37,417
Wait a minute!

346
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,303
Go say hello to your grandmother.

347
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:41,962
Come on, let's go. Move your big ass!

348
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:44,596
What happened with
the last two security guards?

349
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:49,722
- Wake up, Mama.
- What the hell you want?

350
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:52,307
You burned the sauce again.
Give me the spoon.

351
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:53,896
Nobody's gonna hit you.

352
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:56,276
You've lost your mind
since Willie slapped you.

353
00:21:56,364 --> 00:21:57,942
Damn, what happened to her?

354
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,702
You should never have let her
into the commercial, anyway.

355
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,244
Got no business working.

356
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,286
You're the one
gave her a concussion, Willie.

357
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:07,409
- You were supposed to be acting.
- I should have smacked you!

358
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,580
How's she doing?

359
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:12,417
Hey, Big Mama, you all right?

360
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,747
- Who are you?
- lt's Craig, Mama.

361
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,964
- Who Craig?
- Don't worry about it.

362
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:20,006
Your oldest grandson.
The smart one, not Day-Day.

363
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:22,587
She's still having blackouts
and blurred vision.

364
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:24,141
Bet you remember Day-Day!

365
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,384
Why you always
playing with her all the time?

366
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,636
That's enough
damn salt there, Willie.

367
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,438
I know what I'm doing.

368
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,849
Don't nobody want all that salt
in their potato salad!

369
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:34,187
Y'all argue too much!

370
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,566
What's wrong with y'all?
Y'all should get married.

371
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,359
Why are you in so much
competition with me?

372
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:40,860
You jealous, Willie.

373
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:43,620
I can't help it!
I look better than you do!

374
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:44,782
You don't.

375
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,496
- I cook better than you.
- You can't.

376
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:49,748
- My dick is bigger than yours.
- lt was cold that night.

377
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:53,038
Think--last year at this time,
you had won the Lotto,

378
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:55,252
over $1 million.

379
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,294
Anybody else would be living
in the French Riviera.

380
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:00,673
You're back here
cooking pigs' feet with me

381
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:02,755
at Bros. B-B-B-Bar-B-Q.

382
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,924
You tied-tongued dog catcher!

383
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,934
You best check on the sauce.
Mama's out on her feet again.

384
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,514
Dumb-ass dog catcher.

385
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:13,104
''I'm a Lotto stud.
Lotto fucking stud.''

386
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,860
So after Pops and Unc argued
for another 15 minutes.

387
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:17,652
it was time
to meet our new boss.

388
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:18,852
His name is Moly.

389
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:22,363
He ran the whole strip mall
and owned Holy Moly Donuts.

390
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,453
But trust me. don't even. even. even.
even. even. even. even eat there.

391
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,582
We'll take the usual, Moly.

392
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:36,583
How you doing, boy?

393
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:38,915
Good, buddy.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

394
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:40,882
Happy Hanukkah. L'claim.

395
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,249
These are my boys.

396
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:44,421
I'll be with you
in just one minute, buddy.

397
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:46,590
Take your time.

398
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:48,592
Just be still.

399
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:50,345
What's up? How's business?

400
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:53,188
Everything is wonderful. Yeah, boy!

401
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:55,064
Have you seen our commercial?

402
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,985
Barbecue so good, makes you
want to smack your mama.

403
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:02,071
- What the fu--
- Hey, buddy!

404
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:03,781
What the fuck wrong with you?

405
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,527
Sorry, buddy. Reaction.

406
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,703
Hey, guys, I hear
someone's looking for a job.

407
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:10,283
I want to ask a question.

408
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:11,405
l...okay.

409
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,207
When we get our guns?

410
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,914
No guns. You are Top Flight
unarmed security guards.

411
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:18,542
- What about walkie-talkies?
- And flashlights?

412
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:22,047
Whoever catch the girl back there
giving head behind the trash can?

413
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:25,052
I have to come back there
with the flashlight and catch her.

414
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:28,803
You are supposed to be tough guys.
You don't need gadgets, huh?

415
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:30,849
All you need is this here.

416
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:34,430
lf there's any problems,
you just blow. Toot-toot!

417
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:36,930
These guys are here
all the time. They come running.

418
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,603
Goddamn, Craig!

419
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,816
- Can we have more donuts?
- Please.

420
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:43,229
See? Very quick
response time, huh?

421
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:45,114
You guys ready for tour of property?

422
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,366
Give me a twister. Make it two.
Hold the flies.

423
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,778
Keep up. Come on.
One-two, one-two, one-two.

424
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:51,951
Come on.

425
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,872
Since you've been here many times,
I'm gonna make it short and sweet.

426
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,241
Buddy, come on.

427
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,626
As you know, this here is my place.

428
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:02,040
This is
the Holy Moly Donut Shop, huh?

429
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,170
Say it with me, guys--
''Holy Moly Donut Shop.''

430
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:11,140
Very good. You get one
free bear claw every lunch break.

431
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:15,895
- Come on, guys.
- Come on, come on.

432
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:20,275
Okay.
Over here is the Chrome Dome.

433
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,234
You got cars, they got rims.

434
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,405
This, of course, is your
family business, Bros. Bar-B-Q.

435
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,696
That's check cashing.
No l.D. required.

436
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:30,536
This one here
is a brand-new store.

437
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,488
lt's Pimps and Hos--
some kind of flashy clothing.

438
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,243
- Damn!
- Damn!

439
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,994
Who is that?

440
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:41,087
That's Donna.
She's the owner's girlfriend.

441
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,588
He's a funny-dressing kind of guy
from out of town or something.

442
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:49,586
He's kind of a pig, though.
He treat her like shit, man.

443
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,839
I would love for her
to be one of my wives, huh?

444
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,641
Damn, how many wives you got?

445
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:55,766
Me? 12, buddy.

446
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,930
Yeah. All of them freaks, too, huh?

447
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,478
# Freaks come out at night,
what, what, what? #

448
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,109
# Freaks come out at night... #

449
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,569
Whodini. You know Who--

450
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:05,480
Yeah, buddy! Okay!

451
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:09,190
He's a character. Real big character.

452
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:11,075
He's short but big.

453
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,747
# Hold up, wait a minute,
let me put some pimping in it #

454
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,919
He's funny-looking, huh?

455
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:25,923
I don't know. Why he dress like this?

456
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:29,093
How are you? Doesn't matter.
Get the trunk.

457
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,210
Thank you.

458
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:31,633
He's got problems.

459
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,593
Quickly, now, quickly.
Got a business to run.

460
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:36,926
Hey, buddy.

461
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,974
And don't drag that coat.

462
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,686
lt costs more than you do.

463
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,736
Okay, and over here,
this is a liquor store.

464
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:49,858
Don't let nobody hang out
in front of liquor store.

465
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,981
Nobody, buddy.

466
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,274
Nobody.

467
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:55,488
And this is your booth.

468
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,659
Any questions?

469
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,156
- l've got one question.
- What's up, buddy?

470
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,121
What happened to the last guards
that worked here?

471
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:06,079
You ask too many questions, man.
lt's time to get to work.

472
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:09,175
Remember, you guys are
Top Flight security guards,

473
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,170
best in the whole world, huh?

474
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:14,098
You have to defend this whole place
with your own life.

475
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:15,926
And I'll die for this shit, too.

476
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:19,267
Remember, Christmas Eve
means lots of shoppers.

477
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:21,845
lf there's any trouble,
you come get me--

478
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,229
when you take care of it,
then come get me.

479
00:27:24,317 --> 00:27:26,191
Okay, go, go. Come on.

480
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,769
Come on. Keep it real, huh?

481
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:31,568
When are you gonna ask him
for an advancement

482
00:27:31,658 --> 00:27:33,152
on our first week's pay?

483
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:35,912
Don't worry about that.
I'll ask when the time is right.

484
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:37,703
Just keep your rabbit-ass mouth shut.

485
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,660
- Remember what Damon said.
- You remember what I said.

486
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,246
Don't start trying to outthink me,
because you're gonna hurt yourself.

487
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,340
Where you think you going?

488
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:51,094
- lt's small in here.
- No, you're big in here.

489
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,177
Get off my foot!

490
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,927
- Just scoot over there.
- You scoot over, man!

491
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:06,189
This shit is uncomfortable, man.
Can't even move in here.

492
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:08,981
So what? Just deal with it. I got to.

493
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:11,697
What are we gonna do now?

494
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:14,107
Sit here and wait
for something to happen.

495
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,487
Not me.

496
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,239
That shit is boring, man.

497
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,952
Good. I like boring.
Easy money for us.

498
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:24,449
I hope
don't nothing happen all day.

499
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:27,213
We can sit and watch these females
shop till they drop.

500
00:28:27,297 --> 00:28:29,420
Matter of fact, watch out.

501
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:34,208
Ain't this a bitch?
I'm waiting on some action to jump off.

502
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:35,964
You heard what Mr. Moly said.

503
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:38,725
We Top Flight
security of the world, Craig!

504
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:41,513
Shit! Not just the city, the world!

505
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:44,639
Been jacked by Santa Claus,
all kind of shit.

506
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,854
They need security
in the world, Craig!

507
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,056
Shit!

508
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:50,986
For one thing, calm down.
Slow your roll.

509
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,648
Don't let that man pump you up
and get your ass shot out here.

510
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:58,862
We ain't no damn
Top Flight security of the world!

511
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,907
We Craig and Day-Day,
so just kick back, relax--

512
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:04,406
You heard what happened
to the last security guards.

513
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,826
You didn't even hear what happened,

514
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,209
so how the fuck was I gonna hear it?

515
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:11,586
Just do your job,
and I'm gonna do mine.

516
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:15,423
- Shit.
- No problem.

517
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:18,003
- I'm gonna do my job.
- No problem.

518
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:20,174
Get your damn feet
out of my f--

519
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:28,439
# Joy to the world,
the Lord is come #

520
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:31,194
Bingo! I got action.

521
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,028
What's up?

522
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:38,400
# Let every heart
prepare him room #

523
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:40,901
# And heaven and nature sing... #

524
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,327
Heaven and--
fuck all that shit!

525
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:54,088
Y'all hos got to get off
this corner with that!

526
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,835
Excuse me, sugar,
what did you just say?

527
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,714
You heard me what I said.
Y'all hos got to move off this corner.

528
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:00,963
You better watch
your little filthy mouth.

529
00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:03,264
You are talking
to children of the Lord.

530
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:04,466
That's right!

531
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:07,052
I want you to know
who you're talking to, too--

532
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:09,638
Top Flight
motherfucking security!

533
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:12,769
You can't talk to these
old-ass ladies like that!

534
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:14,770
Just back me up
and do your damn job!

535
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:16,902
Y'all movin' on
and take that shit--

536
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,825
Wait a minute, bitch!
I ain't no killer, you understand me?

537
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,653
But don't you push me,
don't you touch me!

538
00:30:21,745 --> 00:30:25,078
You gonna make me blow this.
I'll clear all this shit out with this.

539
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:27,572
Joker, fuck you and your whistle!

540
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:31,083
Y'all trying to use the Lord
to sell pussy on this corner.

541
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:33,128
Shut your little filthy mouth!

542
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,586
Calm down.

543
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:39,796
Let's go on to church, and we
gonna pray for these niggas.

544
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:42,426
Have mercy, Jesus.
Forgive me, Lord.

545
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:44,058
What's wrong with you?

546
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,143
You can't talk to people like that.
That's somebody grandmama, fool!

547
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:49,719
I can talk to people
any fucking way I want to,

548
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,688
and I'm the law around here.

549
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:54,266
And I'm gonna write your ass up
for insubordination.

550
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:56,649
Let me do my job and you do yours.

551
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,018
Top Flight!

552
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:01,199
Man. I couldn't believe
how Day-Day was acting.

553
00:31:01,284 --> 00:31:03,526
Even since he got
that whistle around his neck.

554
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,407
He been acting like
a neal asshole rent-a-cop.

555
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,621
Look at him!

556
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,203
Where you going?

557
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:12,665
I'm trying to park so I can go
in the check-cashing place.

558
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:15,963
You can't park right here
because there's a new policy.

559
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,958
Give me the number,
or you can't park here.

560
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:19,925
I ain't never heard
of no policy like that.

561
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,511
You ain't never met a Top Flight
security nigga like me!

562
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:26,054
Give me the number
or get to fucking rolling.

563
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:29,725
Look at that fool.
I've got to put a stop to this shit.

564
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:31,936
...no parking spot, okay,
'cause I'm married!

565
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,309
- Get this piece of shit out of here!
- He's just playing.

566
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:37,478
No, I'm not playing.
You better not park!

567
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,278
- Bye-bye.
- Bring that car back here!

568
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,937
Man, what did I do?

569
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,278
I got this.

570
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,776
Why every time you get
a little position of power,

571
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,246
you abuse your authority?

572
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,239
You need to work
on your people skills.

573
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:52,452
That's bullshit. My people skills
are way better than yours.

574
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,833
Just sit down and relax.

575
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:01,000
Bingo! Got more action!

576
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:08,055
Get y'all little bad-ass mo'
over here!

577
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,764
Leave them damn kids alone!
They ain't messing with you!

578
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:17,060
Stop blowing that goddamn whistle!

579
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,144
What's wrong with you? You tripping!

580
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,396
Some L.A.P.D. shit.

581
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,194
You know what?
Don't hate...appreciate.

582
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:26,490
You're just mad
'cause I'm always on the...

583
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:29,283
...crime whistle!

584
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,365
I'll calm your ass down
one way or another.

585
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,996
- You ain't got to calm me down.
- Fire that up.

586
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,122
Not on duty. Not on duty!

587
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,791
You better fire this up!

588
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:42,381
I ain't no grocery-store bouncer.
I'm a Top Flight security guard.

589
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:45,220
You got to recognize
the difference between the police--

590
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:48,555
- Light the shit.
- We are not little no more.

591
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,848
- Come on!
- What?

592
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,053
You know what?

593
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:58,854
You're not gonna be punking me
when we get 40.

594
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,779
This shit gonna stop one day, dude.

595
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:05,362
Well, it ain't
gonna stop today, so light it up

596
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,110
before I beat that ass.

597
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:09,490
- Whatever.
- Yeah, yeah.

598
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,702
This Barney Fife shit.

599
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,417
I'm thinking of something right now.

600
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:21,214
That's some good shit, right?

601
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,253
no. You're a bad-ass influence
on my life.

602
00:33:24,344 --> 00:33:26,253
Ever since
l've been kicking it with you,

603
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:28,385
my life
has been a shambles, dude.

604
00:33:29,432 --> 00:33:31,390
Give me my goddamn joint.

605
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,385
Hold on.
Let me hit it one more time.

606
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,767
One more time,
let me hit it, man!

607
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,350
You gave it to me to smoke!

608
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,726
I ain't no bad influence on you.
I'm the best cousin you've got.

609
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,938
lf it wasn't for me, you'd be
getting punked all the time.

610
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,067
And I keep you safe
and I keep you warm,

611
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,866
'cause you know
how little timid you are.

612
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:50,327
Look. Look.

613
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:53,403
Whatever.

614
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,576
Man, it's just us,
Craig and Day-Day. Damn!

615
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,043
I was about to Barry Bonds
y'all's black asses!

616
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:04,005
You almost made me
catch a heart attack!

617
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:07,046
I ought to hit your ass
and give you brain damage.

618
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:09,924
Let me hit that before Willie
bring his old square ass out here.

619
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:13,051
You can go to jail
for some shit like that, for real.

620
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,100
He been real brand-new today.

621
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,645
How's it going out here so far?

622
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,473
lt's been boring and quiet.

623
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:19,893
Just wait around.

624
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:22,474
Them young thugs don't come out
till about 1 :00 or 1 :30.

625
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:25,605
They coming. I just pray to God
I'm here when they come.

626
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:29,232
Uncle Elroy gonna beat
the shit out of 'em!

627
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:30,820
Ho ho ho, motherfuckers!

628
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,402
What you looking at
before I shoot you in your mouth?

629
00:34:33,497 --> 00:34:35,489
Up against the wall!

630
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:37,041
Jesus!

631
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:39,497
Shut up! What you got, toothpick?

632
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:41,543
I ain't got nothing.

633
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,666
Done shit on yourself!
What you looking at?

634
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:46,038
Don't I know you?

635
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:48,886
You gonna know a bullet in your ass!
This all you got?

636
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,927
I ain't got nothing
but 20 funky-ass dollars.

637
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:53,386
I ought to shoot your broke ass.

638
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:54,803
What's up, Al Green?

639
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:58,344
You remind me of them old players
that be clubbing with young girls.

640
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:02,483
You remind me of a young nigga
fucking with the wrong old nigga!

641
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,319
He's gonna shoot your ass!
Get up against the wall!

642
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,941
Shut up! Give me the watch!

643
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:09,406
No, not the Rolie.

644
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:12,611
Now it's a ''stoley.''
Looking like a Mississippi pimp.

645
00:35:12,702 --> 00:35:15,656
Bitch better have my
sweet potatoes. Top Flight Security!

646
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,953
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

647
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,832
Santa Claus got my Rolex!
Let's get him!

648
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,994
Do something! Do something!

649
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:26,544
- Don't just stand there. Help me.
- Shit! How?

650
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:29,674
Move, move, move!

651
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,754
...three quarters,
two dimes, and a nickel!

652
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:40,469
Y'all didn't hear me
blowing this whistle?

653
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:41,678
What is it, buddy?

654
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:45,474
We just got jacked by Santa Claus!
He almost tied us up and fucked us!

655
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:47,810
- He pulled out a pistol...
- Dodo, you on crack, buddy?

656
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:04,034
- Hey, man, just let it go.
- Get your goddamn hands off me!

657
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:07,711
Me, my cousin, and my daddy--
we just got jacked by Santa Claus!

658
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,459
But you're security guard, buddy.

659
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:12,386
That's why I asked your ass
for them two flashlights.

660
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,753
These guys!

661
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:17,509
That's why I hate the fuckin' law!

662
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,344
Get your fat ass up and do something!

663
00:36:19,436 --> 00:36:21,345
You get up, too!

664
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:24,604
Give me flashlights,
or we gonna get killed around here!

665
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:26,767
Jacked by Santa Claus
on Christmas Eve!

666
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,351
Twice in one day!

667
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:32,815
You wanted to grab somebody,
you should've grabbed that nigga!

668
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:36,027
Security! You need to
turn in your damn whistle!

669
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,379
Where you going, Mama?

670
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,338
I'm going to make my daily rounds.

671
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,631
Could you make me a sandwich
when you get back?

672
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,712
Make your own damn sandwich.

673
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:07,732
Tupac. Tupac, Tupac!

674
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:10,439
Goddamn, you fine!

675
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:15,272
Ooh, the way
you talk gangsta, nigga!

676
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:34,251
Yoo-hoo!

677
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:36,420
Anybody home?

678
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,635
Ain't nobody here.

679
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:45,728
Oh, my goodness.

680
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:51,060
What in the hell
done happened to the mail?

681
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:55,235
I ain't the only one they owe.

682
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:58,611
Dirty bastards.

683
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:15,295
This child is filthy!

684
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:23,008
Wishful thinking.

685
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,519
Weed!

686
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,819
Got me some weed!

687
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:37,905
That's why they ain't paid
their damn rent!

688
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:44,236
So what happened after that?

689
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:47,201
I don't want to talk about that.
Y'all ain't gonna catch no damn body.

690
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,961
I just want you to stop and whip
some ass on the way to the station.

691
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:51,705
Least I'll feel better then.

692
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,588
What were you doing
in the alley, anyway?

693
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:55,333
I was emptying the trash!

694
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:57,998
- I had already taken it out.
- Well, it was full!

695
00:38:58,094 --> 00:39:01,012
Don't you mess with this b-b-barbecue.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

696
00:39:01,097 --> 00:39:05,047
I don't give a damn 'bout your lazy eye,
you Popeye-lookin' son of a--

697
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:08,227
Nah, wait a minute!
I started this barbecue shit!

698
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:11,267
ls this the motherfucking
thanks I get?

699
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:13,101
That's enough! Calm down!

700
00:39:13,193 --> 00:39:15,897
I just appreciate you
even blessing me with your presence.

701
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:20,067
Bishop Magic Don Juan
and Money motherfucking Mike!

702
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,569
What they know about that?

703
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,284
Let me get this straight--

704
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:27,996
for the second time,
y'all got jacked by Santa Claus?

705
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,114
Black guy, wasn't it?

706
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:32,163
Nah. This was a nigga that did this.

707
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:34,579
lf I build it, the hos will come.
Learn from the best.

708
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,045
God bless you, Mike.
Keep your game tight, hear, player?

709
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:38,296
Absolutely.

710
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:40,045
...got Daddy's Rolex.

711
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:43,920
# Dashing through these hos
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

712
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:47,883
Everything is 25% off.
Everything must go.

713
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:49,721
Maybe even you.

714
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,847
Explain yourself now, player.

715
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:57,023
- Day-Day!
- Ow, Daddy!

716
00:39:57,112 --> 00:39:58,226
You talk too damn much!

717
00:39:58,321 --> 00:40:01,192
He didn't want to blow
his whistle, so I blew mine.

718
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:03,772
Pay attention!

719
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,573
That's the reason we got jacked
in the first damn place.

720
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:09,118
We'll make out our report
and get back to you.

721
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:13,834
Guys, y'all have to get dressed.
The kids will be here any minute.

722
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,249
Back to work.

723
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:28,842
I didn't know you can make
a snowman in 80-degree weather.

724
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:32,269
Anything is possible.
All you need is a can of snow.

725
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:35,392
What's cracking? My name's Craig.

726
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:37,275
- I'm Donna.
- What's up, Donna?

727
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,104
What kind of stuff y'all sell in here?

728
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:42,611
We got everything--
FUBU, Sean John, Dada.

729
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:44,857
What are you looking for?

730
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:47,359
Anything's better than what I got on.

731
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:49,612
What, you don't like the flashlight look?

732
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,290
I see you got jokes.

733
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:55,535
Well, you can always buy
your girlfriend something.

734
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:57,206
We have ladies' wear, too.

735
00:40:57,297 --> 00:40:58,672
Yeah, y'all do, huh?

736
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,796
I don't really got
a girlfriend, you know.

737
00:41:00,884 --> 00:41:03,173
I usually get rid of them
this time of year.

738
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,005
That way, you ain't got
to buy them shit.

739
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:07,800
For real?

740
00:41:07,891 --> 00:41:08,922
Yeah, why not?

741
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:11,055
I'm just playing.

742
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:14,938
- I see you got jokes.
- A couple.

743
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:17,431
So that's your little
midget boyfriend?

744
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:19,601
Little micro-mini pimp
up in there?

745
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:22,856
Oh! What's cracking, baby?

746
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:27,195
My name is Day-Day, right?
This is my big-head-ass cousin.

747
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,693
You know, beevo-latte, got
more head than he got body.

748
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,412
Check this out--

749
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:33,289
I just spotted you
way across from the lot,

750
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:36,459
and I'm gonna let you know,
it ain't your booty, it's your beauty.

751
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:39,083
lf you see anything
suspicious around here...

752
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:42,833
Let me know, 'cause
I got my eyes on everything.

753
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:44,301
Let's start off with your number.

754
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:46,544
That's the only way we're gonna
be able to communicate.

755
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,714
No, you gotta get your ass
back to that booth.

756
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,598
But, man, she like me!

757
00:41:58,233 --> 00:41:59,347
Come on, woman.

758
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:01,898
I can't move that fast
with this stomach.

759
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,860
Why you got to bring
your ass over here?

760
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:11,739
I was trying to see if she seen
a Santa Claus with a suit on.

761
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,780
- What your ass doing over here?
- You know what I'm doing over here.

762
00:42:17,544 --> 00:42:19,038
I just don't want no bullshit.

763
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:20,872
You know, all that
''my hair retain heat.''

764
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:22,292
I don't know nothin' about that.

765
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:25,502
I'm sorry.
I have to go help them.

766
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:27,503
Fine piece, boy.

767
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:28,971
She fine.

768
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,253
She liked me, didn't she?

769
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,637
- No.
- Yes, she did.

770
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:35,264
How she gonna like you
when she like me?

771
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,061
'Cause she hadn't seen me yet.

772
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:39,898
I wish I hadn't seen you yet.

773
00:42:39,983 --> 00:42:41,098
Can I help you?

774
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,770
I just walked in the store.

775
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,482
Let me look around a little bit. Dang!

776
00:42:49,242 --> 00:42:51,947
I could use some help over here.
ln the men's.

777
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:54,610
Burn a pimp,
see what happen to you.

778
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,078
That's all you gotta do,

779
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,705
l'd like this FUBU sweatshirt
with some socks.

780
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:01,827
Are you all right?

781
00:43:01,922 --> 00:43:03,795
I'm fine, I just--

782
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,262
This can't be happenin',
this can't be happenin'.

783
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,844
Oh, no, player!

784
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:18,141
- You see that?

785
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,934
Turn him off!
What the hell's wrong with him?

786
00:43:21,024 --> 00:43:23,645
Come on, Bill, let's go.
I don't see nothing in here I like.

787
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:27,021
No, you ain't sick no more.

Baby still kicking?

00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,068
Yeah, feel like twins.

791
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,153
- We saw that shit!

792
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:36,368
Let me go!

00:43:36,456 --> 00:43:37,487
Get ahold of her, man!

794
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:43,628
Stop letting her kick your ass!

795
00:43:43,713 --> 00:43:45,124
Y'all going to jail!

796
00:43:45,215 --> 00:43:47,920
For shop-stealing
and stealing everything!

797
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:49,753
We ain't stole shit!

798
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:50,959
What about this?

799
00:43:51,054 --> 00:43:52,217
Uh-huh!

00:43:52,305 --> 00:43:54,547
Aw, damn!

801
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:58,140
- That ain't nothin' you like?
- You going to jail, Cicely Tyson.

802
00:43:58,228 --> 00:44:00,683
Girl, I can't believe you did this!
I'm appalled!

803
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:03,097
You ain't Paul!
You a nigga that steals!

804
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:11,776
Y'all got the game messed up!
Huh? You gonna steal from a pimp?

805
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,448
Where is Elroy?

806
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:21,617
He's in the back.
He doesn't want to come out.

807
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,789
What?!

808
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:24,336
Keep your voice down.

809
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:27,914
Merry Christmas, everybody.

810
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:30,629
Come on out here right now

811
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:32,047
or you and I are gonna fight!

812
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:35,552
All the money we spent for these.
Get your butt out here, man.

813
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:39,180
Aw, Elroy, you look cute.

814
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:40,893
Oh, he's a cutie-pie.

815
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,304
We ought to be celebrating
Kwanzaa, anyway.

816
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:46,399
Messing with these kids' heads
with this white man's holiday.

817
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:48,192
Oh, shut up, Elroy.

818
00:44:48,278 --> 00:44:50,567
Prance your ass over
and let them kids pet on you.

819
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,564
Oh, hell, no, Willie!

820
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:55,492
That's where I put my hoof down.
Ain't nobody pettin' on me!

821
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:58,150
Will you shut up?
Prance your ass over there!

822
00:44:58,246 --> 00:45:00,784
Let them kids pet on you.
What's wrong with you?

823
00:45:00,874 --> 00:45:03,199
That ain't prancin'. lt ain't Easter.

824
00:45:03,293 --> 00:45:04,621
I ain't know no damn reindeer.

825
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:06,869

You ain't gotta do this.

00:45:16,348 --> 00:45:17,379
Shut the fuck up!

831
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,591

832
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:25,558

833
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:26,894
Hey, player.

835
00:45:31,238 --> 00:45:32,518
Player!

836
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:34,072
Nah, nah, let him through.

837
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:35,485
You little shrimp motherfucker.

838
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:37,615
I'm gonna sue your ass!
Come on, cut me!

839
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:38,781
No, no, no!

840
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:42,199
Give me that, give me that.

841
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,497
I guarantee I wanna do my thing!

842
00:45:44,584 --> 00:45:47,254
- Think about your mama, man.
- I'm thinking about your ass.

843
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:49,080
Think about what
your mama would say.

844
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:50,750
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

845
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,877
You know what I'm saying?
I got a little razzle-dazzled.

846
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:56,720
My name is Money Mike, player.
How you doing?

847
00:45:56,805 --> 00:45:58,133
All right, don't squeeze hard.

848
00:45:58,223 --> 00:45:59,931
All right, what's happening?

849
00:46:00,016 --> 00:46:02,223
This is my young girl Donna.
Say hi, woman.

850
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,342
What's up?

851
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:05,228
That'll be quite enough.
Thank you so much.

852
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:07,270
See, the thing is,
we just opened up around here,

853
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:08,520
you know what I'm saying?

854
00:46:08,608 --> 00:46:11,064
And we've been having
some problems, obviously, as you see.

855
00:46:11,152 --> 00:46:12,730
I appreciate what y'all did

856
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:15,109
'cause these cockroaches
would've cleaned me out.

857
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:17,487
Speaking of cockroaches,
where was your antennas

858
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,983
when them niggas were stealing
my shit out the store?

859
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,995
- I didn't see them take anything.
- You didn't see 'em take anything.

860
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,121
Well, look next time! Use your eyes!

861
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:28,873
They ain't supposed to just be hazel,
they supposed to do some damn work!

862
00:46:28,962 --> 00:46:31,168
This ain't for play.
I don't do this for fun.

863
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:32,335
I'm sorry.

864
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:36,208
Don't be sorry.
Ho, be careful! Lord Je--

865
00:46:36,302 --> 00:46:37,583
You know what?

866
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:39,755
I'm tired of your presence. Dismissed.

867
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:41,639
Nice meeting you guys.

868
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,302
See you later.

869
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:46,974
You got her trained, nigga, damn!

870
00:46:47,063 --> 00:46:50,267
You can lead a ho to water, player,
but you can't make 'em think.

871
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:51,603
You dig what I'm sayin'?

872
00:46:51,693 --> 00:46:53,353
I got to keep it
breezy around this bitch.

873
00:46:53,445 --> 00:46:55,069
Anyway, I need to take care of y'all.

874
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:56,863
I appreciate
what y'all did for a player.

875
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,656
I can't be everywhere at all times.

876
00:46:58,741 --> 00:46:59,773
No charge.

877
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:01,576
- What about our rent money?
- No charge.

878
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:03,286
Y'all sure?

879
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:06,575
Positive. We just doing our job.
We can't charge you, man.

880
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,077
Don't argue with ''no charge.''

881
00:47:08,168 --> 00:47:09,959
You can come to the store
anytime you want.

882
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:12,583
Can we get some clothes,
30% off, 40% off?

883
00:47:12,672 --> 00:47:14,914
- A FUBU short set?
- You don't need shit.

884
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:16,668
Man.

885
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,333
Look, we just having a little
Christmas party tonight.

886
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:22,632
Why don't you and your lady come or
hang out with us and our folks?

887
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:24,633
Let me check my Palm Pilot.

888
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:27,304
Look like I ain't doin' shit.

889
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:28,510
Bring a bunch of bitches--

890
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:31,356
I'm talking about
a busload of them hos if you can.

891
00:47:31,441 --> 00:47:34,644
I was gonna get drunk and watch
The Grinch. so I'll be there.

892
00:47:34,736 --> 00:47:37,357
I'll get the address from y'all later.
I'll see you later, too.

893
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:39,155
Yo, yo, player, hold up.

894
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,783
Never know
what I might need this for.

895
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,868
Might want to shave.
Might want to shave somebody else!

896
00:47:43,954 --> 00:47:45,496
Never know.

897
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,284
I like that nigga! I like him!

898
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:51,210
Look, that's real pimpin'.
Now, that's pimpin'.

899
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:53,251
Get off his dick, Day-Day.

900
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:56,172
What do you want
for Christmas, young fella?

901
00:47:56,258 --> 00:47:59,377
I want a X-Box with all the games,
all the new gear,

902
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:01,841
a new Lexus
with a banging system

903
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,472
and chrome feet on it.

904
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:06,889
Here's my address, Mr. Jones.

905
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:09,053
Mr. Jones?

906
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:11,185
No, Santa.

907
00:48:11,272 --> 00:48:13,561
- I'm Santa.
- Bullshit! You Mr. Jones.

908
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,604
I know where you live, too,
so I expect everything by tomorrow.

909
00:48:16,695 --> 00:48:17,726
You feel me?

910
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:20,229
Put everything in my mom's name.

911
00:48:20,323 --> 00:48:22,696
He don't look like no reindeer,
he look like a pit bull.

912
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:24,243
Giddy-up, pit bull.

913
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:28,111
You better stop jumping up and down
before I have to bite your little ass.

914
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:30,495
Can you lock your jaws
and shake like a pit bull?

915
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,576
Yeah. Want me to show you?

916
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:35,420
My brother said if a pit bull
locks his jaws like that,

917
00:48:35,505 --> 00:48:37,628
you're supposed to do this to him...

918
00:48:40,176 --> 00:48:42,928
I didn't have to take anything.
lt was all her. Come on, man.

919
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:44,970
Take her! Let me go! Come on!

920
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:49,554
- Later, Moly.
- Okay, buddy, take care.

921
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:51,387
A-Team!

922
00:48:52,355 --> 00:48:55,273
# Bad boys!
What you gonna do? #

923
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:57,398
Dodo! Good job, buddy.

924
00:48:57,485 --> 00:48:59,145
- Thanks.
- You, too, Clyde.

925
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:02,155
- Take lunch, one half-hour.
- That's cool right there.

926
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,734
Don't be late.

927
00:49:06,202 --> 00:49:07,946
That's a dirty motherfucker.

928
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:09,947
He blowin' smoke in our face
on the first arrest?

929
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,119
That's bullshit.

930
00:49:11,207 --> 00:49:13,745
I told you there ain't no future
in being a company man.

931
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:16,326
- Let's just go to lunch.
- Let's go. I'm hungry.

932
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:19,255
Ain't that...

933
00:49:19,341 --> 00:49:21,713
Get them niggas! Come on, sugars!

934

00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,286
Pimping ain't easy but--

951
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:36,406
No!

952
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:38,494
No? Well, this ain't the Baby Gap.

00:50:38,586 --> 00:50:39,997
Get your fake ass out of my way!

954
00:50:40,088 --> 00:50:42,543
Oh, this is bullshit.

955
00:50:42,632 --> 00:50:44,791
I'm in between
a pimp and a hard place.

956
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:50,964
Donna! Man down!
1 1-30! Pimp in distress!

957
00:50:51,057 --> 00:50:52,635
Oh, Lord, where the hell is Donna?

958
00:50:52,726 --> 00:50:54,932
- Can I help you?
- Yo, move!

959
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,475

- What's your problem? Move!

960
00:50:57,564 --> 00:50:59,722
- I can't let you back there.
- Why? Who back there?

961
00:50:59,816 --> 00:51:00,895
Did you hear me?!

962
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:03,557
Go, go, go!

963
00:51:08,783 --> 00:51:11,274

Let's jump. Let's jump.

970
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:54,486
Yo, Moly! I heard

971
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,702
that's been harassing
my grandmother and things.

972
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,988
Two new guys--Clyde and Dodo.

973
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,787
You remember what we did
to the last security guards?

974
00:52:00,877 --> 00:52:02,786
Yes, I do, buddy.

975
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:06,829
When you see them,
you tell them we said this...

976
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:09,498
Help! Somebody, help me!
Help me, please!

977
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,302
Somebody, help me, please!

978
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:15,381
Did you see
what they just did to Moly?

979
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:17,468
They gonna kick our ass
when they catch us.

980
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,636
That's why
they ain't gonna catch us.

981
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:25,149
Where them rent-a-cops at, huh?

982
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,570
What you looking at, old man?
Mind your own fuckin' business.

983
00:52:30,657 --> 00:52:33,112
Come on. Let's just jump
on Moly's car.

984
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:34,695
Craig, I'm scared, man.

985
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:37,359
So what? Me, too.

986
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:41,448
Oh, fuck this.

987
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:44,579
I'm not about to get my motherfuckin'
ass kicked over no job!

988
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,829
You smart as a motherfucker today.

989
00:52:48,091 --> 00:52:49,502
Shit.

990
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:52,208
This way.

991
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,423
Oh, shit!

992
00:52:58,226 --> 00:53:00,385
Wow! Oh, my God!

993
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:02,222
Damn!

994

996
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:12,572
Oh, good observation, buddy.
Where were you, buddy, huh?

997
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,282
We was on our lunch break.

998
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,285
Trying to get something to eat
so we could secure this nasty-ass lot.

999
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,612
Good, you were eating
while I was getting beating.

1000
00:53:19,706 --> 00:53:22,279
Look like somebody beat the bricks
off your motherfucking ass.

1001
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:24,035
You're supposed to be
security guard, no?

1002
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:25,835
We are security. Ain't that a bitch?

1003
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,581
We are security guards.

1004
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:30,299
Oh, no, not anymore.
You're both fired.

1005
00:53:30,383 --> 00:53:31,794
Oh, man!

1006
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:33,213
Man, what the fuck?

1007
00:53:33,303 --> 00:53:34,548
Oh, hell, no!

1008
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:37,425
We just got this job!
How you gonna fire us?

1009
00:53:37,516 --> 00:53:40,516

I don't know. I'm not
even in the spirit no more.

1030
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,906
Don't let nobody ever take

00:57:42,385 --> 00:57:43,583
We miss you down there!

1092
00:57:43,678 --> 00:57:45,754
Man, I know y'all do.
Why'd you fire me, Pink?

1093
00:57:45,847 --> 00:57:48,848
I had to! You was always late, fool!

1094
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:50,131
Say it again!

1095
00:57:50,268 --> 00:57:51,383
Say it again!

1096
00:57:59,903 --> 00:58:01,646
Damn, girl, you eating again?

1097
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:07,778
What's up O.G., triple O.G.?

1098
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:09,992
- What's up?
- How you doing, man?

1099
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,194
Everything all right?

1100
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:13,116
- I'm cool, dawg.
- Good.

1101
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:17,122
Got my shank in case
shit jump off in this motherfucker.

1102
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:19,703
Relax, homey, ain't nothin'
about to jump off in here.

1103
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:22,040
That's my people, man!
That's my folks.

1104
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:24,126
My grandma, my uncle.

1105
00:58:26,846 --> 00:58:29,420
What you need to do, man,
is grab one of these females

1106
00:58:29,516 --> 00:58:30,927
and get your boogie on.

1107
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:33,306
I don't want to dance
with none of these hos.

1108
00:58:33,395 --> 00:58:34,640
You're a fool.

1109
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:39,057
Ooh, what's up?

1110
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,977
Merry Christmas.

1111
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:42,314
Who is that?

1112
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:43,649
How are you?

1113
00:58:43,738 --> 00:58:45,232
Oh, I'm all right.

1114
00:58:45,323 --> 00:58:46,354
You look great.

1115
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:49,984
That's, uh, that's Donna.

1116
00:58:50,078 --> 00:58:51,821
You the greenest
little troll I ever seen!

1117
00:58:51,913 --> 00:58:54,239
Who the nigga she with?

1118
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,874
That's just Money Mike.

1119
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:59,375
Little Lucky Charms,
little micro-mini pimp.

1120
00:58:59,462 --> 00:59:02,084
Oh, that nigga look
magically delicious, nigga.

1121
00:59:02,173 --> 00:59:03,751
That's right.

1122
00:59:03,842 --> 00:59:04,956
Perm and shit.

1123
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:06,546
Craig, look who here!

1124
00:59:06,636 --> 00:59:09,423
Yeah, bring him over here.
Bring his ass right here.

1125
00:59:09,514 --> 00:59:11,970
Oh, man, thanks
for coming through, man.

1126
00:59:12,058 --> 00:59:13,718
I appreciate that.

1127
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,435
No problem.
Thanks for inviting us.

1128
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,936
We had to show y'all some love
after what y'all did for us at the store.

1129
00:59:19,024 --> 00:59:20,648
Don't she look good?

1130
00:59:20,734 --> 00:59:22,607
lntroduce me to your friend, Craig.

1131
00:59:22,694 --> 00:59:26,145
Oh, that's Money Mike.

1132
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:27,899
- That's Donna.
- Hi. Merry Christmas.

1133
00:59:27,991 --> 00:59:30,482
This Damon. He live downstairs.

1134
00:59:32,037 --> 00:59:34,706
That was like The Matrix!

1135
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:37,459
Got some testosterone problems.

1136
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:40,211
Why don't you go get me
something to drink, please?

1137
00:59:40,295 --> 00:59:41,623
Thank you.

1138
00:59:41,713 --> 00:59:43,670
- Where is it?
- Right through here.

1139
00:59:46,009 --> 00:59:47,040
No, no.

1140
00:59:49,888 --> 00:59:52,426
Like to dislocated my shoulder.

1141
00:59:52,515 --> 00:59:55,600
Yo, homey, you ever been to the pen?

1142
00:59:55,685 --> 01:00:00,810
Hell, no, but thanks for asking.
Won't bother asking you, though.

1143
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:03,816
- Uh, Craig?
- Yeah.

1144
01:00:03,902 --> 01:00:05,230
Where your bathroom at, player?

1145
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,063
I got to piss
like a Russian racehorse

1146
01:00:07,155 --> 01:00:09,611
at the Kentucky Derby
with a glue truck behind him.

1147
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,495
Yo, it's right through there.

1148
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:17,070
I got to pee diddy! About to get it on.

1149
01:00:17,165 --> 01:00:19,372
Hey, don't piss on the seat.

1150
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:31,466
What's up, O.G., triple O.G.?

1151
01:00:31,554 --> 01:00:33,179
You got that look in your eye.

1152
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:35,387
Fresh fish on the line, nigga.

1153
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:37,432
Ain't nothin' like that shit.

1154
01:00:41,022 --> 01:00:43,347
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

1155
01:00:44,526 --> 01:00:48,061
Have to drink a little bit more water.
Smell like ammonia in this bitch.

1156
01:00:48,155 --> 01:00:49,814
Come on. There you go.

1157
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:54,445
One at a time, player, one at a time.

1158
01:00:54,536 --> 01:00:56,196
Busy right now,
working with a monster.

1159
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:57,996
You know what this is, new booty!

1160
01:00:58,081 --> 01:00:59,955
- New booty?
- Don't fight the shit.

1161
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,536
- Fight what shit?
- Let it happen.

1162
01:01:01,626 --> 01:01:03,749
Let what happen?
What the hell you doing?

1163
01:01:03,837 --> 01:01:06,328
Phone books? Nigga,
I ain't even in the phone book.

1164
01:01:06,423 --> 01:01:09,839
This ain't funny, nigga.
I'll bitch-slap your ass.

1165
01:01:09,926 --> 01:01:11,207
Come on, I ain't playin'.

1166
01:01:11,302 --> 01:01:13,793
No!

1167
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:17,969
Here's my card right here
if y'all ever want to be pimped.

1168
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:19,174
Day-Day.

1169
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:22,305
Better not let Pinky see that shit.
We ought to give it to him, though.

1170
01:01:22,397 --> 01:01:23,975
That's a barbecue card.

1171
01:01:24,065 --> 01:01:27,019
Don't give a fuck. That's where
I'm pimping, out of the barbecue place.

1172
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:30,479
Come and get
barbecue-slapped. Shit.

1173
01:01:32,532 --> 01:01:34,988
Sneaky son of a bitch.

1174
01:01:35,076 --> 01:01:36,950
Damn, he's been
in there a long time.

1175
01:01:37,037 --> 01:01:38,495
I told you he was sick.

1176
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,786
He might be in there
throwing up anything.

1177
01:01:40,874 --> 01:01:42,534
Why don't we just step in here?

1178
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:44,452
We can sit down
and wait for him in here.

1179
01:01:45,795 --> 01:01:47,254
All right.

1180
01:01:56,848 --> 01:02:00,264
You got a nice room here.
Pretty clean for a bachelor.

1181
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:03,934
I got a nice bed, too.
Wanna try it?

1182
01:02:04,022 --> 01:02:06,809
- You funny, huh?
- I'm not trying to be funny.

1183
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,936
I'm trying to spread
a little holiday cheer,

1184
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:12,519
get close to you.

1185
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:18,034
So, what brings you to California

1186
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:21,204
with this little
half-a-Prince motherfucker?

1187
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:23,365
You know, I ask myself
that same question.

1188
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:26,329
What am I doing way out here,

1189
01:02:26,419 --> 01:02:31,544
away from my family
this time of year?

1190
01:02:31,633 --> 01:02:34,503
But it's just hard.

1191
01:02:34,594 --> 01:02:37,002
Shit, just leave.

1192
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:39,588
You don't understand.
lt's not that easy.

1193
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:43,513
I mean, he got you
all the way out here

1194
01:02:43,603 --> 01:02:47,186
so he can, you know,
mistreat you,

1195
01:02:47,274 --> 01:02:49,065
do all them things to you--

1196
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,439
you know, I want
to do some things to you

1197
01:02:51,528 --> 01:02:53,437
that, um...

1198
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:56,980
You sure you don't want
to just, like, lean back?

1199
01:02:57,075 --> 01:02:59,281
What you think?

1200
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:03,527
No!

1201
01:03:03,623 --> 01:03:04,951
Don't do it!

1202
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,370
You got some condoms?

1203
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:08,666
Day-Day, get the hell out of here!

1204
01:03:08,753 --> 01:03:11,375
You know damn well you got
all the rubbers in your--

1205
01:03:11,464 --> 01:03:14,300
Get the fuck out of here!

1206
01:03:14,384 --> 01:03:16,175
She liked me anyway, didn't you?

1207
01:03:17,303 --> 01:03:18,502
You're a trip.

1208
01:03:18,597 --> 01:03:21,088
You know what? Don't pay
no attention to Day-Day.

1209
01:03:21,183 --> 01:03:23,638
- That boy, he just a fool.
- You know what?

1210
01:03:23,727 --> 01:03:26,681
Let's just go before
Mike comes busting in on us.

1211
01:03:27,689 --> 01:03:31,556
And, Craig, a word of advice--
you should get a lock on this door.

1212
01:03:33,528 --> 01:03:35,568
I ain't never gonna get no pussy.

1213
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:39,449
What if I tried to get
a lock right now and just--

1214
01:03:41,286 --> 01:03:42,566
All right. God!

1215
01:03:43,663 --> 01:03:46,333
- Come on out of there!
- Pop, what's the matter?

1216
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:47,697
Who's in the bathroom?

1217
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:49,583
That eggnog about
to kick back up on me.

1218
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:50,950
You know I got them bad guts.

1219
01:03:51,046 --> 01:03:53,287
Man, Pops gotta boo-boo, come on!

1220
01:03:53,381 --> 01:03:55,006
Don't tell everybody!

1221
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:56,633
Hey, you know what?

1222
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:59,090
The lady will let you
use it downstairs, the landlady.

1223
01:03:59,179 --> 01:04:00,210
Miss Pearly.

1224
01:04:00,305 --> 01:04:02,547
Go on down. She'll let you use it.

1225
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:04,468
Come on out of there, man!

1226
01:04:06,895 --> 01:04:08,354
Honey, where you going?

1227
01:04:08,438 --> 01:04:10,727
I'll be right back. Oh, boy!

1228
01:04:33,755 --> 01:04:35,831
All right!

1229
01:04:36,925 --> 01:04:38,502
All right!

1230
01:04:38,593 --> 01:04:41,629
I'm Craig's daddy--Willie Jones.

1231
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:44,343
As you know, we're having
a little get-together upstairs,

1232
01:04:44,432 --> 01:04:46,555
and the bathrooms are jammed.

1233
01:04:46,643 --> 01:04:48,351
I like the way you got that lined up.

1234
01:04:48,436 --> 01:04:50,061
Mind if I use yours?

1235
01:04:50,271 --> 01:04:51,552
No. Come on in.

1236
01:04:51,648 --> 01:04:53,854
- Where's it at?
- Down the hall.

1237
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:55,353
Thank you.

1238
01:04:59,906 --> 01:05:01,733
All right, there we go.

1239
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:07,032
There we go. About time.

1240
01:05:07,122 --> 01:05:09,447
Oh, just what I needed so bad.

1241
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:13,579
Yeah, there it is.

1242
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:22,375
How you doing?

1243
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:25,140
Show me what you working with.

1244
01:05:25,223 --> 01:05:27,548
- Oh, damn!
- What's wrong with you, fool?

1245
01:05:27,642 --> 01:05:29,350
That's my woman you're dancing with.

1246
01:05:29,436 --> 01:05:31,309
Hey, fool, your woman's
freaking with me!

1247
01:05:31,396 --> 01:05:32,807
I bought them titties!

1248
01:05:32,897 --> 01:05:34,143
What's wrong with you?

1249
01:05:34,399 --> 01:05:35,941
I'll bust a cap right in your fat ass.

1250
01:05:36,025 --> 01:05:37,270
Don't mess up the party, Elroy.

1251
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,278
Dance with me, dance with me.
Come on, dance with me.

1252
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:47,743
Did you pee on me?

1253
01:05:47,829 --> 01:05:50,949
Wake your bitch-ass up,
Lucky Charms.

1254
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:53,531
I like my fish wet and squirmy.

1255
01:05:53,626 --> 01:05:56,960
I thought I was dreaming.
You almost drowned me, nigga.

1256
01:05:57,047 --> 01:05:59,502
Oh, you dreaming. This a wet dream.

1257
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:01,963
Wet dream?
Wait a minute, I'm a pimp!

1258
01:06:02,052 --> 01:06:04,128
You lost your mind? What the hell?!

1259
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,300
Am I in prison?

1260
01:06:05,388 --> 01:06:07,297
Donna! Pimp down!

1261
01:06:10,226 --> 01:06:12,848
You got a lot of balls!

1262
01:06:14,355 --> 01:06:18,056
Pimpin', pimpin', pimpin'!

1263
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,605
You was just gonna take it,
wasn't you? Hmm?

1264
01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:26,656
You thought I was
play-pimping, didn't you?

1265
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:28,486
Yeah, okay, okay.

1266
01:06:32,082 --> 01:06:33,991
- Could you just let me go?
- Say something.

1267
01:06:34,084 --> 01:06:36,753
I was just playing with you.

1268
01:06:36,836 --> 01:06:38,829
I was playing with you, dawg.

1269
01:06:38,922 --> 01:06:40,464
I was playing, man, okay?

1270
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:42,837
I'm a nice guy
when you get to know me.

1271
01:06:42,926 --> 01:06:45,796
Shut up! What the hell
you talking about?

1272
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,674
I am a boy!

1273
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:52,597
You are not in prison
anymore, Damon!

1274
01:06:52,686 --> 01:06:54,512
That's not how we do it!

1275
01:06:56,272 --> 01:07:00,056
Say, noog! This is Pinky, noogah!
Look, I got to go pee-pee!

1276
01:07:00,151 --> 01:07:03,271
Uh, Damon, are you a music lover?

1277
01:07:03,363 --> 01:07:05,984
You are? Good. Have you
ever heard of The Nutcracker?

1278
01:07:06,074 --> 01:07:08,316
Oh, shit!

1279
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:09,987
Have you, huh? Have you heard it?

1280
01:07:10,078 --> 01:07:11,406
Huh? Huh?

1281
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:13,987
Yes. Yes.

1282
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:19,208
# Crunching on your balls
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

1283
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,710
Mom, what's the matter?

1284
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:27,043
Where did your father go?

1285
01:07:27,137 --> 01:07:29,343
He just went downstairs
to use the bathroom

1286
01:07:29,431 --> 01:07:31,340
over at Miss Pearly's, the landlady.

1287
01:07:31,433 --> 01:07:35,810
Oh, Miss Pearly. Hmm...

1288
01:07:35,895 --> 01:07:37,093
Excuse me.

1289
01:07:40,525 --> 01:07:41,723
Mama.

1290
01:07:42,819 --> 01:07:44,527
Oh, shit!

1291
01:07:44,613 --> 01:07:45,775
Hey!

1292
01:07:47,657 --> 01:07:50,777
Should be a law against
people with guts like mine.

1293
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:53,407
That was a monster--
Why it so dark in here, baby?

1294
01:07:53,496 --> 01:07:55,370
What are you about to do,
pray or something?

1295
01:07:55,457 --> 01:07:57,698
Did your son tell you I said hi?

1296
01:07:59,794 --> 01:08:01,586
No. Pertaining to what?

1297
01:08:01,671 --> 01:08:04,458
Your son Craig
ain't paid his rent this month,

1298
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:07,669
and I'm about to throw him
out on his ass tomorrow.

1299
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,216
So how much do you
really love your boy?

1300
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:13,887
Not enough to pay his fucking rent.
I have enough trouble paying my own!

1301
01:08:13,975 --> 01:08:16,810
I'm not talking about rent,
Willie Jones.

1302
01:08:16,895 --> 01:08:19,053
Well, what you talking about,
Miss Pearly?

1303
01:08:19,147 --> 01:08:21,270
I'm talking about these nuts!

1304
01:08:23,651 --> 01:08:25,977
You're gonna give me
some of this dick today!

1305
01:08:26,071 --> 01:08:27,862
I don't even know you, woman!

1306
01:08:27,948 --> 01:08:29,774
I heard they call you
''Sweet-Dick Willie.''

1307
01:08:29,866 --> 01:08:31,064
- Who, me?
- Yeah!

1308
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:32,902
- You heard that, huh?
- Yeah.

1309
01:08:32,994 --> 01:08:34,952
Yes, baby, I'm a bad mother.

1310
01:08:35,038 --> 01:08:38,537
- Can I have some of it?
- Let me go, woman! Hell, no!

1311
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:39,739
I don't know you, woman!

1312
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:41,245
Oh, Sweet-Dick Willie!

1313
01:08:41,336 --> 01:08:43,661
Willie, get your ass off that heifer!

1314
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:47,122
Daddy, get your ass off that heifer!

1315
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:52,087
Yeah, pimping!

1316
01:08:54,432 --> 01:08:57,184
That's right.

1317
01:08:57,269 --> 01:08:59,392
Hey, I want everybody back!

1318
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:01,887
There's gonna be
ball juice everywhere!

1319
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:03,808
Everybody get back!

1320
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,229
Get back in the house!

1321
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:09,317
Don't take anybody!

1322
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,198
Y'all get the hell
out of my house!

1323
01:09:12,284 --> 01:09:14,157
My dick wouldn't get hard!

1324
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:16,035
Whip his ass, Mama!

1325
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:18,694
Miss Pearly, you ain't right,
trying to give my daddy V.D.

1326
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:20,783
I'm calling the police on y'all, fool!

1327
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,117
Well, get that lined up,
too, first, bitch!

1328
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:24,540
Go to hell!

1329
01:09:24,629 --> 01:09:27,713
Player. Player!

1330
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:28,878
What's going on?

1331
01:09:28,967 --> 01:09:30,046
Ain't nothin', player.

1332
01:09:30,135 --> 01:09:32,092
Thanks for inviting me. I appreciate it.

1333
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:33,258
Donna, get the car.

1334
01:09:33,346 --> 01:09:34,840
Come on, player.

1335
01:09:34,931 --> 01:09:36,639
Hey, them my vise grips, man!

1336
01:09:36,725 --> 01:09:40,343
Yeah, that's his nuts, too.
You can have them both back!

1337
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:42,180
Look, I'm just saying, man,

1338
01:09:42,272 --> 01:09:44,264
let him go, and there
won't be no hard feelings.

1339
01:09:44,357 --> 01:09:45,437
No hard feelings?

1340
01:09:45,525 --> 01:09:47,518
Have you ever seen
a rottweiler bite a chihuahua?

1341
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:48,986
No.

1342
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,644
Me, neither, but it
ain't pretty, I'm sure of it.

1343
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,483
Now you hold on
till I get in the car.

1344
01:09:53,575 --> 01:09:57,822
Dude, I'm not about to touch
his nuts or them vise grips.

1345
01:09:57,913 --> 01:10:00,035
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1346
01:10:00,123 --> 01:10:02,163
- Yes, you are!
- Bullshit.

1347
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,409
You invited me to this party,
ain't that right?

1348
01:10:04,502 --> 01:10:07,172
That's right. Whatever
y'all do, make it quick.

1349
01:10:07,255 --> 01:10:09,295
I think I'm gonna pass out.

1350
01:10:09,382 --> 01:10:10,461
No, no, no--

1351
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:13,171
lt's your party, your pliers,
his nuts in your hand.

1352
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:15,717
That's how it's going.
Donna, get the door.

1353
01:10:15,805 --> 01:10:17,679
I'll get the car door.

1354
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:21,259
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

1355
01:10:21,353 --> 01:10:23,392
Yeah.

1356
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,354
I'll call you.

1357
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,563
Hold on.

1358
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:30,022
[SlLENTLY] Call me.

1359
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:31,226
- Hey!
- What?!

1360
01:10:31,321 --> 01:10:33,230
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah.

1361
01:10:33,323 --> 01:10:34,900
Get these pliers!

1362
01:10:34,991 --> 01:10:36,450
All right. You ready?

1363
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:37,815
I'm ready. I'm ready.

1364
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:39,535
- You ready?
- Oh, I'm ready, player.

1365
01:10:39,621 --> 01:10:41,495
On the count of three--

1366
01:10:41,581 --> 01:10:43,740
- Here we go. One...
- On your balls...

1367
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:45,244
- Two...
- Grab a handful...

1368
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:47,078
- Three!
- Go!

1369
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:49,713
Hey!

1370
01:10:49,798 --> 01:10:53,665
Donna, you can't leave me!
Hey, pimp in distress!

1371
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,799
Bitch, I ain't--hold on!

1372
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:58,425
How the fuck
you gonna leave me?!

1373
01:10:58,515 --> 01:11:00,673
He gonna fuck the lining
out of Little Prince.

1374
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:04,467
Code 1 1-32--pimp missing!

1375
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:09,723
What?

1376
01:11:09,818 --> 01:11:11,312
You see that mother?

1377
01:11:11,403 --> 01:11:13,312
That-that's--

1378
01:11:13,405 --> 01:11:16,074
He the one
broke in the apartment!

1379
01:11:33,717 --> 01:11:34,748
You see him?

1380
01:11:34,842 --> 01:11:37,001
Yeah, he just went
through there on the side.

1381
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:48,604
- You ready?
- I'm not going in there, man.

1382
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:51,774
Stop being so scary.
All our stuff might be in there.

1383
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,481
Why you always
got to be a hero, man?

1384
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:55,769
Take your--go over there.

1385
01:11:55,864 --> 01:11:58,616
I bet something bite you in the ass.
I'm not going.

1386
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,906
No, I don't want
to get bit in the ass.

1387
01:12:00,994 --> 01:12:03,449
Ten more minutes before Christmas.

1388
01:12:03,538 --> 01:12:06,872
Ten more minutes.
That's what I'm talking about.

1389
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:11,620
Lord have mercy,
I'm tired as a runaway slave.

1390
01:12:11,713 --> 01:12:13,337
Let's see what I got.

1391
01:12:13,423 --> 01:12:15,546
Don't nobody get me nothin', anyway.

1392
01:12:17,511 --> 01:12:19,254
Oh, snap.

1393
01:12:19,346 --> 01:12:21,552
Dada.
I always wanted me a Dada.

1394
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,347
Hell, yeah.

1395
01:12:23,433 --> 01:12:26,268
Extra medium?
Extra medium?

1396
01:12:26,353 --> 01:12:29,389
Hell, got to have something
for the skinny niggas.

1397
01:12:29,481 --> 01:12:32,268
Day-Day, this could be
our last chance.

1398
01:12:32,358 --> 01:12:35,479
You keep your timid ass here.
I'm going to get my shit.

1399
01:12:38,114 --> 01:12:40,688
Yeah, I roll to the club
just like this, baby.

1400
01:12:40,784 --> 01:12:43,987
Santa Claus up here,
grabbing me some wallets,

1401
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:46,914
cigarette lighters, some car keys.

Nope, I didn't hear that part, Pinky.

You're costing me money, C.W.

- Yo, Day-Day.

1479
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:24,743
I'm glad we got
our rent money back, baby.

1480
01:18:24,836 --> 01:18:26,460
What are we gonna do
with that fool?

1481
01:18:26,546 --> 01:18:28,918
I don't know. Po-pos will get
his dumb ass sooner or later.

1482
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:32,127
Ho ho ho, motherfucker!

1483
01:18:32,218 --> 01:18:33,796
There you have it.

1484
01:18:33,887 --> 01:18:37,220
Another Friday gone.
another problem solved.

1485
01:18:38,558 --> 01:18:40,302
Wejust took oun stuff
back to the panty

1486
01:18:40,393 --> 01:18:43,513
and left Santa Claus on the roof
for the police to get.

1487
01:18:43,605 --> 01:18:48,231
Fan as I know.

1488
01:18:48,318 --> 01:18:51,604
Pimp down!
Pimp missing in action!

1489
01:18:51,696 --> 01:18:52,977
And Money Mike.

1490
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:54,982
you know. he's still
getting chased by Damon

1491
01:18:55,075 --> 01:18:56,569
all through the 'hood.

1492
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:59,660
There's a loud party upstairs
that's keeping me up.

1493
01:18:59,746 --> 01:19:01,988
Could you please send a unit?

1494
01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:04,158
Miss Peanly kept on hating on us.

1495
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,038
We didn't even cane.
We kept on partying.

1496
01:19:07,128 --> 01:19:09,584
My uncle got drunk
and eventually passed out.

1497
01:19:09,672 --> 01:19:11,333
And look at Pops--

1498
01:19:11,424 --> 01:19:14,674
You know. he showed his ass
till the po-pos came.

1499
01:19:14,761 --> 01:19:18,972
- Open the door! Let's do this!
- Put down the b-b-b-b-barbecue.

1500
01:19:19,057 --> 01:19:20,848
But all they wanted
was some mone weed.

1501
01:19:20,934 --> 01:19:22,214
So we looked them up.

1502
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:26,059
and I even kept
Day-Day's dumb ass occupied.

1503
01:19:26,147 --> 01:19:27,642
And a German shepherd mix!

1504
01:19:30,818 --> 01:19:33,356
That's till
my moms walked in on him.

1505
01:19:33,446 --> 01:19:36,780
And me. you know how a player do.

1506
01:19:36,867 --> 01:19:39,073
I convinced Donna
to bring her fine ass

1507
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,619
back to the panty.

1508
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:42,198
got her in my room.

1509
01:19:42,288 --> 01:19:44,411
slid the dresser
in fnont of the door.

1510
01:19:44,499 --> 01:19:47,121
and got myself
an early Christmas present.

1511
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,203
You know!

1512
01:19:54,634 --> 01:19:56,792
I'll beat-box your ass!
