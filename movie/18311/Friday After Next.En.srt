00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:04,358
This is how many cases
I have, okay?

168
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,095
I don't have time
to waste.

169
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:11,098
Now, I get
3 sessions only...

170
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:17,241
to make an eval...

171
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:22,243
and a recommendation to
your commanding officer.

172
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:27,022
You know
he wants to throw you...

173
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,424
out of the navy,
don't you?

174
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,420
Now, you can sit here,
and you can not talk...

175
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,729
to me ifyou want to...

176
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,405
but our sessions
don't begin...

177
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:49,403
until you begin
talking to me.

178
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:56,777
I got nothing
to say.

179
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,327
Okay.

180
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:08,322
Then we'll sit
until you do.

181
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,635
I got a whole lot of
work to catch up on.

182
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,864
We can sit
here every day...

183
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,237
until the day I retire.
Doesn't matter to me.

184
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,832
It doesn't matter
to me, either.

185
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,276
- All righty.
- What about the brig?

186
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,008
What about it?

187
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,539
Send me to the brig.

188
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:30,351
There's the brig
right there.

189
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:35,190
Lockyourself up.

190
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:40,187
What do you know?
Time's up.

191
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:53,334
See you next week,
1 400.

192
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,391
Want some chips?

193
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:11,624
Hmph.

194

[Coughing]

196
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:20,961
What?

197
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,140
I didn't say anything.

198
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:27,305
I thought
you said something.

199
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,749
Ahem. I was just
clearing my throat.

200
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:36,744
Okay.

201
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,319
[Clears Throat]

202
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:43,317
Maybe you're coming
down with something.

203
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,559
Ahem. I'm all right.

00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:54,368
[Wheezes]

205
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,239
It's just sort of...

206
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,767
Just what?

207
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,508
Just...

208
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,674
It's just a waste
oftime sitting here...

209
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,148
week afterweek...

210
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,879
wasting time.

211
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,217
I don't want you...

212
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,154
to waste your time,
Antwone.

213
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,420
So, whatyou
want me to say?

214
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,687
It's not what
I want you to say.

215
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,217
It's what you
want to tell me.

216
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,628
Maybe you can start
by asking me a question.

217
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,567
I don't know.
Get things going.

218
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,093
I can do that.

219
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,904
You said you come
from under a rock.

220
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,410
What did you mean
by that?

221
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,241
I don't know, I...

222
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,239
It was the first thing
to come to my mind.

223
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,218
[Sighs]

224
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,221
What do you think
it means?

225
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,313
Well, it could mean...

226
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:49,316
that, uh...

227
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,164
thatyou feel
under pressure...

228
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:05,165
that, uh...

229
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,319
uh, you feel a weight...

230
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,292
pressing down on you.

231
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,122
That you're in the dark,
that you're alone.

232
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,423
You said you had
no parents.

233
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,293
I had parents.

234
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,662
Okay.

235
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,997
Ahem. Only 3 sessions,
right?

236
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,529
Only 3.

237
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,165
My father's name
was Edward.

238
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,334
So you knew him?

239
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,776
No.

240
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,676
I didn't even know
his last name.

241
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,681
You know where he is?

242
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:48,277
Yeah, I know
where he is.

243
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,309
Joey--

244
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,878
He went to his
ex-girlfriend's house.

245
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,857
They got into
an argument.

246
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,792
She killed my father.

247
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,886
Where was your mother
when this happened?

248
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,227
Behind bars.

249
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,097
I see.

250
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,226
I was born in prison...

251
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,704
2 months after my
fatherwas murdered.

252
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,366
Whywas she confined,
your mother?

253
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,241
I don't know.

254
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,074
All I know
is what I told you.

255
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,208
So you were turned over
to the state?

256
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,619
Yeah. The state placed
me in this orphanage.

257
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,747
It was supposed to be until...

258
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,655
my mother got out
to claim me, but--

259
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,920
She got out, but she
never claimed me.

260
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,920
Hmm. How long
wereyou there?

261
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,732
2 years.

262
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,464
How does that make
you feel, Antwone?

263
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,463
I don't know.

264
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:48,468
Come on, you must have
some feelings about it.

265
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:54,241
You know, you--
What did it feel like?

266
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,648
Rainy days.

267
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:04,651
Rainy days? Okay.

268
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,865
Why is that?

269
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,493
You know,
in Cleveland...

270
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,800
it rains.
Not all the time...

271
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,799
but, uh, to a kid...

272
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:24,204
who wants to go out
and play...

273
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:29,243
it seems like it
rains every day.

274
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,152
But, uh...

275
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,488
kids expect it
to rain sometimes...

276
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,519
but...for one kid...

277
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,203
it rained too much.

278
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:54,201
Hmm.

279
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,909
Okay.

280
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,915
You want me to
come back next week?

281
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:02,909
Yes, I do.

282
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,550
You ever try to
find her, your mother?

283
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,119
No, sir.

284
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:12,994
Okay. Next week.

285
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,225
Busy day?

286
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,131
Uh, no more than usual.

287
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,500
Hmm.

288
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:23,497
The tomatoes are
from our garden.

289
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,939
Yeah?

290
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:32,211
Mmm. They're so much
better than last year.

291
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,548
Heh heh.

292
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,679
I mean, I'm no green
thumb or anything...

293
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,020
but...heh heh.

294
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,547
Who knows?
Maybe I'm learning.

295
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,651

really are good.

Antwone, Voice-over:
When I was 2...

307
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,129
I was placed in the Tate
foster home.

308
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:28,128
Reverend Tate, he was
a fire-breathing preacher.

309
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,237
He had his own
storefront church.

310
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,268
There was only
a few members.

311
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,178
There was Ms. Tate,
cousin Nadine...

312
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,480
my foster brothers Keith--

313
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,952
Keith was halfwhite--

314
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,980
Dwight, and me.

315
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,850
& Good God, yeah &

316
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,591
It was church 3 times
on Sunday...

317
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,689
Bible study on Tuesday...

318
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,721
Y.P.W.W. meetings
on Thursday...

319
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:59,726
choir rehearsal on Friday.

320
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,730
We found out ifwe caught
the Holy Ghost...

321
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,709
in front of Ms. Tate...

322
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,872
she'd give us vanilla
wafers after church.

323
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,848
So we'd catch it
every Sunday.

Whyyou always got
to make things...

495
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,940
difficult for me?

496
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,815
Difficult?

497
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:52,812
Difficult.

498
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,953
Where you learnin'
such fancywords at?

499
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:01,954
Fancy?
Ain't no fancyword.

500
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,836
Don't sassy me, boy.

501
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:12,832
No one's
sassing you.

502
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:22,575
Don't sassy me!

503
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,698
Ain't no one
sassing you!

504
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:41,830
Don't you--

505
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:46,833
I ain't gonna let you
beat me no more!

506
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,050
No more!

507
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,856
Lord Jesus.

508
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,126
I want you out
of my house.

509
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,757
Hmm?

510
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:13,793
And whoyou think
gonna takeyou in, huh?

511
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,600
Retarded nigger,
don't nobodywantyou.

512
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,972
Your damn mammy
didn't even wantyou.

513
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,450
Mrs. Tate:
Gimme my shoe. Hmpf!.

514
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:38,451
Davenport:
Must've felt pretty good...

515
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,305
when you took
that shoe from her.

516
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,931
Yeah, I felt
like I was gonna go...

517
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,999
right upside
her head...

518
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:57,003
but I just chilled.

519
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:39,011
Why'd you chill?

520
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:49,422
I don't know.

521
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:18,084
Well, I'm glad you did.

522
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,599
How'd you feel?

523
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,415
I felt like
I won a prize...

524
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:50,416
but it scared me.

525
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,363
Why?

526
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,797
It was the first time
I ever felt...

527
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,826
more powerful than her.

528
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,569
It was like a surprise.

529
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:09,568
Whatever happened
to Jesse?

530
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,710
We lost touch.
You know how it is.

531
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,320
Davenport: Yeah.

532
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,764
It might be helpful
to understand the mentality...

533
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,860
of people
like the Tates.

534
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:37,863
Here.

535
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:49,608
It's called
The Slave Community.

536
00:39:55,926 --> 00:40:00,158
Why I gotta understand
somebody beatin' on me?

537
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,858
What you went through...

538
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:06,859
was in part the result
of the treatment...

539
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,519
that slaves received
from their masters...

540
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,218
and then passed on
to their own children...

541
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,787
generation to generation
to generation...

542
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,422
right on down
to the Tates.

543
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,400
Sir, that sounds
like an excuse.

544
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,595
I mean, I was a kid.

545
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,901
I understand.

546
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,271
You sound like you
takin' up for 'em.

547
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:49,268
I'm not saying
what they did was right.

548
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,143
What they did
was wrong.

549
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:58,144
We all have choices.
They made the wrong choices.

550
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,522
But this is not about them.
This is aboutyou.

551
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,052
You were sent to me...

552
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,188
because you have
an anger problem.

553
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,165
Well, you got the right
to be angry.

554
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,160
But you also have to learn
to channel that anger...

555
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:20,065
to use it
constructively.

556
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,807
Instead of gettin'
into fights...

557
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,109
go to the gym.

558
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,082
Hit the bag,
lift the weights.

559
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:31,076
You have to use that energy
to betteryourself.

560
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:36,282
You sayyou're taking
Japanese classes, right?

561
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,320
Yeah.

562
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,530
Okay, you're already
on the right track.

563
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,936
Can we talk about
this next week?

564
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:53,933
3 sessions, son.
Unfortunately...

565
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:03,442
that's all I'm given
to make a recommendation...

566
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,593
and I'm gonna recommend...

567
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:16,589
thatyou be given
a second chance.

568
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:27,233
That is whatyou want,
isn't it?

569
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,877
To stay in the navy?

570
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,644
Yes, sir.

571
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:37,643
Okay.
Okay, stay out oftrouble.

572
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,850
Cheryl: Antwone!

573
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:53,726
Antwone!

574
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,141
What's up?
How you doing?

575
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,667
I'm cool.

576
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,705
Oh.
You don't seem cool.

577
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:20,085
I'm all right.

578
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:33,232
What are you
doin' in there?

579
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,918
You still workin'
on that paper?

580
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:45,819
No, I'm finished.

581
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:50,816
I just went through there
for a short cut.

582
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,531
Oh. Whereyou goin'?

583
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:02,528
Nowhere.

584
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:08,067
I--I gotta go.

585
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,213
Cheryl, I'll talk
toyou later.

586

[Laughing Together]

587
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,958
Whyyou always talkin'
about somebody's momma?

588
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,996
Man, we ain't talkin'
about somebody's momma.

589

We talkin'
aboutyour momma!

"Dis a ship!"

What's that book
you readin'?

599
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,836
Let me see
the cover.

600
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,843
The Slave
Community.

601
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,435
Whatcha readin'
that shit for?

602
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:53,439
Because I want to.

603
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,122
This ain't
no slave ship.

604
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,321
And these ain't
no slavery days.

605
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,955
I can't tell.

606

You the only buck-dancin'

Whyyou always
talkin' shit, man?

610

What I do ain't got nothing
to do with you.

out of my face, bro.

00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,892
No, sir,
I mean I slipped up...

657
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:35,795
when I talked to you.

658
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:40,792
What?

659
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:45,739
3 sessions, right?

660
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,937
That's correct.

661
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:52,108
Can't be floutin'
regulations.

662
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,173
That's correct.

663
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,547
Well, what do I do,
Commander?

664
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,144
'Cause I don't know
what to do.

665
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:02,147
I don't know
what to do.

666
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:14,136
Tired?

667
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:19,131
[Chuckles]

668
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,240
How was your day?

669
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:35,147
Long.

670
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:57,844
Not complaining,
though.

671
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:02,841
Well,
don't wait up.

672
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:07,522
I got a lot
ofwork to do.

673
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:12,517
I know.

674
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,359
- Good night.
- Good night.

675
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,698
Well, it's nice
to finally be off...

676
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:23,228
restriction
for a change.

677
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:28,233
Yeah, I'm gonna be
squared away from now on.

678
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:36,408
Hey!

679
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:45,917
Y'all need somethin'
from the exchange?

680
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:07,176
Man, what's up with you
and the exchange?

681
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,244
You spend more time there
than you do on restriction.

682
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,085
I'm just tryin' to be
a good shipmate, man.

683
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:16,183
I'm only kiddin'
with you.

684
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,284
But bring me back
some Skittles.

685
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:21,559
And a Snickers.

686
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,463
And some pork skins.

687
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,800
And a sandwich.
Thankyou.

688
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:32,797
What areyou

689
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,408
I was in the area
and sawyour ship.

690
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:35,775
Soyou just saw
this big ol' ship...

691
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,643
moored alongside
the pier?

692
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:42,641
I want to seeyou

693
00:53:55,198 --> 00:54:00,158
next Wednesday,
after knockoff.

694
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:09,843
That is, ifyou want
to continue.

695
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:14,839
I think I need to check
my calender first...

696
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,530
sir.

697
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,627
Okay.

698
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,797
Well, you let me

699
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,101
Yes, sir.

700
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,100
I

701
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:49,441
Hey, Cheryl.

702
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,196
- Hey.

703
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:11,366
What's going on?

704
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:16,345
Nothing.

705
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:21,339
You just gettin'

706
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:39,257
Yeah.

707
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:03,815
Oh.

708

You, uh--
You mad?

709
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:15,427
Whywould I be mad?

710
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:21,438
I'm sorry.

711
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:26,438
That's cool.
[Chuckles]

712
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,615
So, you finally
off restriction?

713
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,520
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

714
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:37,959
Yeah.

715
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,987
So you can
hang out now?

716
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,498
Yeah.

717
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:47,196
So what about now?
I'm off.

718
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:52,197
Nah, I gotta--
I gotta meet somebody.

719
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,340
Well, I promised
I'd meet somebody...

720
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:18,590
in a few minutes,
so...you know.

721
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,977
What's her name?

722
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:32,971
[Chuckles]
Look, it ain't like that.

723
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,677
It ain't like that.

724
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,680
What about tomorrow?

725
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,769
Um, what about the day
after tomorrow?

726
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,906
Say, Wednesday,
after knockoff?

727
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:11,148
That'd be better.

728
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:16,147
Okay. Um...

729
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,519

of the female barracks...

730
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:33,598

731
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:45,944
Okay. All right.

732
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:53,251
I'll meet you
at 1 700.

733
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:04,529
All right.
Yeah.

734
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:13,610
It's a date.

735
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:18,610
Antwone:
Are we done?

736
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,717
Davenport:
Yes, we are.

737
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,352
Can I askyou
a question?

738
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,555
Sure.

739
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:31,556
Um...
do you think it's--

740
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,206
Do you think
it's possible...

741
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:46,204
for somebody that had
problems all their life...

742
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,582
you know,
not to stay that way?

743
00:59:55,625 --> 01:00:00,585
You know,
you think it's possible...

744
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,789
they can change?

745
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:04,697
Absolutely.
Why do you ask?

746
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:05,860
No reason.

747
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:10,862
Do you want
something to drink?

748
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:33,785
- No, I'm good, sir.
- Okay.

749
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:40,058
Uh, you know, you--

750
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:54,080
You know, when you
kinda meet somebody...

751
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:58,019
you know, ifyou
have problems...

752
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:03,014
it wouldn't--

753
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,119
Who is she?
What's her name?

754
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:12,123
What's her name?

755
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:20,431
Cheryl.

756
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:30,408
She works
at the exchange.

757
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,122
That's a good thing.
Keep it navy.

758
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,058
[Chuckles]
Right?

759
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:42,053
So?

760
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,524
Um... so, um...

761
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:50,528
Have you spoken
to heryet?

762
01:01:56,512 --> 01:02:00,004
Yeah, I spoke to her,
but, um...

763
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:03,143
I get caught up--
tongue-tied.

764
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,347
Everybody's
awkward at first.

765
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:10,348
Okay.

766
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:19,757
No, not like me.

767
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,531
No, everybody is,
Antwone. Trust me.

768
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:28,533
Even you?

769
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:45,015
Even me. Everybody.

770
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:50,021
So...

771
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,005
Well, we're
going out tonight.

772
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,878
Good.

773
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,853
We supposed to go out
a couple of days ago...

774
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:16,848
but, uh, you know...

775
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:22,264
I just wanted
to clear my head.

776
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:27,258
Take some time.

777
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,036
You know,
talk to you first.

778
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:34,031
Okay.
Yeah.

779
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,945
So, what
should I do?

780
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,079
[Laughs]
Well, she's a nice girl?

781
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:51,025
Yeah, obviously
you like her.

782
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,963
Mm-hmm.

783
01:03:55,998 --> 01:04:00,958
Okay, I thinkyou should
just go out with her.

784
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:38,095
I mean...

785
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,569
I tell you what.
You know, sometimes it helps...

786
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,738
just to take the anxiety
out of a future meeting...

787
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,339
to role play.

788
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,714
What's that?

789
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,048
Like, you playyourself
and I'll play Cheryl...

790
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,576
and I'll askyou
some questions...

791
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:52,383
and we'll have
a conversation...

792
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:57,381
and you'll see that
you'll have a good time, okay?

793
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:11,796
Yeah,
you play Cheryl.

794
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,086
Okay, now.
That's right.

795
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,822
That's right.
I'm man enough to play Cheryl.

796
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:37,822
Okay.
Uh, you go first.

797
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,866
Nah.

798
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:52,870
I'll go first.

799
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:57,213
So...

800
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:01,519

801
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:06,517
Fine.

802
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,610
Good, good.

803
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:36,255
So, where we gonna go?

804
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:41,252
Out.

805
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:48,692
See?

806
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:53,698
Uh...

807
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,814
[Antwone Sighs]

808
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:08,813
I'm hungry. You?

809
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,407
I could eat.

810
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,772
See? That's good.
You got it.

811
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,802
You think so?
Absolutely.

812
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:35,806
I don't thinkyou have
anything to worry about.

813
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:44,849
I'm gonna giveyou
my phone number.

814
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:55,463
Ifyou have
any problems...

815
01:07:55,504 --> 01:08:00,464
any questions at all,
you can call me.

816
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,270
Any time of day
or night.

817
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:07,510
Have fun.
Give me a call, okay?

818
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:12,510
We're gonna be fine.

819
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:17,915
Okay.
You never know, son.

820
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:23,120
These things,

839
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,907

01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:18,903
All the money
we're makin'.

841
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:24,441
That's why I joined
the navy, you know?

842
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:30,656
To see the world,
build a fortune.

843
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,921
I don't know
what to do...

844
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,124
with all
the money I got.

845
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,825
Okay, now tell me...

846
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:37,854

the navy.

847
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,924
For real?

848
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,265
Yeah, for real.

849
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:45,262
All right, well...

850
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:04,114
my father's a navy man,
Vietnam vet...

851
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,396
and, uh, his boys were
gonna grow up one day...

852
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,524
and join and serve
just like he did.

853
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:16,527
Only one little problem.
He didn't have any boys.

854
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,423
- So you...
- Mm-hmm.

855
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:40,417

[Chuckles]

856
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:48,699
It's worth it,
you know?

857
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:53,697
I mean, even if
I hated the navy--

858
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:58,736
which I don't--

859
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:22,903
it's worth it
just to...

860
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:27,898
just to see his eyes
and the way they shine...

861
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:34,672
when I put on
that uniform.

862
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:43,814
[Chuckles]

863
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:54,258
