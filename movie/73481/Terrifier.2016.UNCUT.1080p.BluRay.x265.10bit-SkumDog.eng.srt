00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,085
Welcome back to the program.

3
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,088
If you're just tuning
in, I'm sitting here live

4
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,890
with the sole survivor of
the Miles County Massacre,

5
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,995
which occurred exactly one year
ago today.

6
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,328
I've worked on this show for
many years

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,963
and I've never sat across from
someone

8
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,001
who has a story to tell quite
like yours.

9
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:08,234
Thank you again for taking the
time

10
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:09,902
to sit down and speak with me.

11
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,272
It's my pleasure.

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,074
Now when we left off we were
talking

13
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:16,809
about the moment you
woke up from the coma.

14
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,178
Do you remember your initial
reaction

15
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,946
when you first saw your face?

16
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,413
Yes.

17
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,717
Would you like to share that
with us?

18
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,121
I wished I was dead.

19
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,823
Do you still feel that way?

20
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:32,225
People are frightened
by the way that I look,

21
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,329
especially children.

22
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:37,863
And it's really difficult
for me to deal with that,

23
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,300
so isolation is ideal.

24
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,438
Now what about your attacker,

25
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,806
a man identified only as Art the
Clown?

26
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:51,276
There's a lot of controversy
surrounding his supposed death.

27
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,511
The authorities issued
a statement claiming

28
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,014
that his body disappeared from
the county coroner's office

29
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:56,381
the morning after the attack.

30
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,816
He's dead.

31
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,384
I saw it happen.

32
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,141
Did you watch it?

33
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:30,409
Oh my God, I thought she
was going to attack me.

34
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,219
My heart was pounding the entire
time.

35
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:40,954
Yeah well, if you think she
looks that bad on television,

36
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:44,157
imagine what she looks like
sitting two feet away from you.

37
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,926
I thought I was going to gag at
one point.

38
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,327
Babe, do me a favor.

39
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,862
If I ever look like that,
promise me

40
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,266
you'll put me out of my misery.

41
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,533
You think I'm kidding?

42
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:54,837
I'll do it myself.

43
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,271
Yeah, Tom said we won't
know until the morning.

44
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:00,339
But he thinks the ratings
are going to go up big time.

45
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,647
Exactly.

46
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,316
We've finally figured out
the formula for success,

47
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,119
faceless victims and a host in
jeopardy.

48
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:15,821
Yeah, watch next month, it's
going

49
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,959
to be called Monica's House of
Horrors.

50
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,659
Shit.

51
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,493
Hey, can I call you back?

52
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,197
I have like 50 people calling
me.

53
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,198
Okay.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,599
Alright, love you too.

55
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:27,469
Bye.

56
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,206
Hello?

57
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,005
Tom?

58
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,368
I think I just twisted
my ankle.

59
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,204
Dawn, really?

60
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,503
Thanks a lot, by the way.

61
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,638
For what?

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,241
Promising you weren't
gonna get shit faced tonight.

63
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,642
Guys kept buying me drinks.

64
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,512
I can't help it if people
find me interesting.

65
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,479
Yeah.

66
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,082
Definitely your mind that they
were after.

67
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,183
Who are you texting?

68
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,185
None of your business.

69
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,219
You gave that asshole
your number, didn't you?

70
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,688
Oh my god, you're so jealous.

71
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,690
Of what?

72
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,092
That kid was talking to
like five other girls.

73
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,426
Oh, stop being such a bitch.

74
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,426
Just get in the car.

75
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,462
Oh, you are not driving.

76
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:04,731
I'm fine.

77
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,065
Give me the keys.

78
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,500
Give me the keys.

79
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:09,368
Dawn, I don't feel like dying
tonight.

80
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,270
Really?

81
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,137
Are we really gonna do this
right now?

82
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,140
Give me the keys.

83
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:16,476
I'm gonna paw at you like a cat.

84
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:17,342
Give me what I want.

85
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,311
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

86
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,046
You drive.

87
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,416
Thank you.

88
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:31,690
I'm fucking lit.

89
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:35,628
But if I get something to
eat, I can drive us, okay?

90
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,796
There's a place that's
open late, we can sober up.

91
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,332
Did you say food?

92
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:40,633
I said food.

93
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,168
You know the place, it's
right there, come on.

94
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,169
Okay, okay, okay.

95
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:45,772
Just like give me one minute.

96
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:47,140
Fuck me.

97
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:49,111
Like one minute, for real.

98
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:55,317
D.

99
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,251
D.

100
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,152
What?

101
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,289
Look.

102
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,123
Holy shit.

103
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,157
Yeah, that's not funny.

104
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,625
I'm about to scream.

105
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,161
Hey, handsome.

106
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:08,861
Dawn, cut it out.

107
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,296
My friend wants your number.

108
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,265
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

109
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,132
Come buy us dinner.

110
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:13,799
Stop.

111
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,267
Just shut the fuck up.

112
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:15,902
Or what?

113
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,803
Maybe he'll drive us home.

114
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,575
I'm sorry, she's drunk.

115
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,515
Let's go.

116
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,416
Come on.

117
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,085
Let's just go.

118
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,157
Oh yeah?

119
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,128
You get dressed up?

120
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:42,794
Oh, you're a sick fuck.

121
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,695
Where am I gonna go?

122
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,130
Back to my wife?

123
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:45,800
Same shit.

124
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:48,734
Maybe another two hours?

125
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:49,835
Alright.

126
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,105
Alright, bye.

127
00:07:58,413 --> 00:07:59,712
Great.

128
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:03,382
Ugh.

129
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:07,520
That was the longest
piss I have ever taken.

130
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,358
Thank you for sharing that.

131
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,392
This guy wants me to meet
him at his apartment right now.

132
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,260
What a shocker.

133
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:15,527
I told him I would.

134
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,561
What?

135
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,398
I'm kidding.

136
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,832
I have a little more
self respect than that.

137
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,537
If you only had a brain.

138
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,205
I've been wanting to
use that one all night.

139
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,808
Congratulations.

140
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,260
Look it's your boyfriend.

141
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,629
I told you this a week ago,
we'll go to your mother's.

142
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:51,366
I don't know, six weeks from
now.

143
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,502
I'll be right with you buddy.

144
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,601
You gotta see the shape of this
fuckin'

145
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,772
guy that just walked in.

146
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,236
Are you okay?

147
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,607
I think we should get our food
to go.

148
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:36,445
Why?

149
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,150
Him?

150
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,417
Seriously, I wanna leave.

151
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,820
Jesus Christ.

152
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,221
D, stop.

153
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:49,157
Uh, excuse me?

154
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:50,923
Excuse me?

155
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:52,692
Can I get a picture with you?

156
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:53,558
Dawn, come on.

157
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,396
Shut up.

158
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:57,466
Hello?

159
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:00,836
Hello?

160
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,369
Okay.

161
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:05,841
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

162
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,409
Oh.

163
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,812
Oh.

164
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:13,714
Sorry.

165
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,733
Thanks.

166
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,569
What the hell is wrong with
you?

167
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:38,438
What?

168
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,138
Did you think he was gonna hack
me up

169
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,242
into little pieces or something?

170
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:42,945
What can I get for you buddy?

171
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:45,914
Hey?

172
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:47,782
Hello?

173
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:53,722
If you don't order anything,
you're gonna have to leave.

174
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,358
You already have eight likes.

175
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,229
Can you hear me in there?

176
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:05,834
Oh god, it's gonna be a long
night.

177
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:39,935
Aww.

178
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:47,775
What are you doing?

179
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,549
Thanks.

180
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,923
Okay, not for nothing,
but that's the nicest thing

181
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,058
a guy's done for you all night.

182
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,593
Seriously?

183
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,562
What the fuck?

184
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:10,666
Here you go ladies.

185
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,466
Yes.

186
00:12:13,468 --> 00:12:14,667
You two okay?

187
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:15,771
Oh, he's harmless.

188
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:17,572
You okay?

189
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:20,573
Don't worry, I'll take care of
him.

190
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:21,509
Enjoy your pizza.

191
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:39,891
What do you keep staring at?

192
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,059
That bag.

193
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,563
What do you think is in it?

194
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,131
I don't know, who cares?

195
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,101
Just eat your food.

196
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,704
You fuckin' freak!

197
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,405
Get over here.

198
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,875
All night with you, you fuck.

199
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:56,777
Enough.

200
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,114
Get outta here.

201
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,390
Take your shit, and don't come
back.

202
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,760
Ramon, grab a mob and some
bleach.

203
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,629
Eh, you okay?

204
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,866
Yeah, I'm alright.

205
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,513
What do you think
that guy did in there?

206
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:35,847
Who knows.

207
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,716
Probably jizzed
all over the place,

208
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:38,683
fucking pervert.

209
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,586
Stop.

210
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,721
What?

211
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:43,555
I'm telling you that guy
totally whacked off in there.

212
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,624
He was obviously turned on by
you.

213
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:46,925
You're fuckin' sick.

214
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:47,828
You know that?

215
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,664
What?

216
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,167
- Look at your hand.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

217
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,802
Look, at least he had the
courtesy to do

218
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:57,903
whatever he did in private.

219
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,606
I mean, he could have
whipped it out right there.

220
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,545
I really don't need the
visual.

221
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:08,047
Well are you okay to
drive?

222
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,752
Yeah, trust me, that
sobered me right the fuck up.

223
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,251
- Oh my god.
- What?

224
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,122
Your tire.

225
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,056
Fuck me.

226
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,558
Has it been like this the whole
time?

227
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,893
I think I would have said
something if I'd noticed

228
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,760
that your tire had exploded.

229
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,130
Why does this shit always
happen to me?

230
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,635
Do you have a spare?

231
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,803
It's on the car.

232
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,805
Wow.

233
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,939
I'm starting to feel sick.

234
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,108
Just, give me your phone.

235
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,112
I'll call my sister.

236
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,750
Yo Steve, this is sick.

237
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:47,285
I better get overtime for this.

238
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,188
No joke, this is disgusting.

239
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,055
You got me cleanin' piss
and shit at one o'clock

240
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,757
in the morning.

241
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,226
Let the guy who handles
food take care of it,

242
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,897
real fuckin' sanitary.

243
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,166
Steve, time and a half, or I'm
out.

244
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:02,671
You hear me?

245
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,313
Hello?

246
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:15,550
Hi, it's me.

247
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,816
Tara?

248
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:18,983
Yeah, my phone died.

249
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,885
I'm calling from Dawn's.

250
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:21,754
Ah.

251
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:22,789
Your phone died.

252
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,023
Can you ever go out
without using social media

253
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,924
every 30 seconds?

254
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,659
I think you're the only one in
America

255
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,260
who has that sort of restraint.

256
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,996
Yeah, that's probably right.

257
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,231
Did I wake you?

258
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,634
No, I am studying for
my midterm tomorrow.

259
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:36,901
Oh, shit.

260
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:41,008
Why, what is it?

261
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:42,975
What is it, Tara?

262
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:45,177
Dawn and I are sort
of stranded right now.

263
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,978
She has a flat tire and no spare

264
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,617
and I was kind of hoping
you could pick us up?

265
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,651
I have to be up in five hours,
Tara.

266
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,687
Yeah, I know Vic.

267
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,121
Don't bother, seriously.

268
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,825
I didn't realize you had a test.

269
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:04,032
Sorry.

270
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,836
I didn't know you were here.

271
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,808
You know what?

272
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,776
I gotta stretch my legs
and besides, if I fail,

273
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,245
I can always blame you.

274
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,751
You are the best sister in the
world.

275
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,787
Yeah.

276
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,723
Where are you?

277
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:41,969
What's wrong?

278
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:44,837
I'm fine.

279
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,105
Why?

280
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:49,243
You keep looking over your
shoulder.

281
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,211
Just thinking.

282
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:53,048
About?

283
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:55,250
Nothing.

284
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,185
Tell me.

285
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,222
What if that guy did this to
your car?

286
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:04,289
What guy?

287
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,189
The clown?

288
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,226
I'm serious.

289
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,998
Well, you really think
someone slashed my tires?

290
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,667
Well, he knows this is your
car.

291
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,435
He saw us getting into it
earlier.

292
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,036
That's fucking ridiculous.

293
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,741
I probably just ran over
a nail or something.

294
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,043
I should have just let you
drive.

295
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,079
Yeah, you should have.

296
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:30,114
But as usual, you have
to be the good Samaritan

297
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,216
so here we are.

298
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,284
Stuck.

299
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,154
Like a couple of assholes.

300
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:48,369
Steve!

301
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,290
Oh fuck!

302
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:20,799
Help!

303
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:24,969
Somebody!

304
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:43,155
Yeah, but what if I'm right,

305
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:45,990
and he's out there watching us
right now?

306
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:49,393
Show him your tits.

307
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,429
I don't know, Tara.

308
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,465
Look, that guy was harmless.

309
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,935
He's just some douchebag in a
costume

310
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:59,905
acting like a retard
because it's Halloween.

311
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,177
No.

312
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,147
He was different.

313
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,416
He smiled.

314
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:13,151
The way he kept staring at
us with those dead eyes.

315
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,357
What was in that bag?

316
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,794
I don't know, Tara.

317
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,963
The point is, he's gone,

318
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,465
and you're never gonna see him
again.

319
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:30,805
So cut the shit, 'cause you're
starting to freak me out.

320
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,986
I really have to pee.

321
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:48,957
So go.

322
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,290
Go?

323
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:51,990
Go where?

324
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,159
It's the middle of the night.

325
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,928
I can't just pop a squat
in the middle of the street

326
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,996
and pee like you do.

327
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:59,264
Well tough shit, because
it's gonna be a while

328
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,466
before your sister gets here.

329
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,336
Fuck.

330
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,114
Maybe that guy has a
bathroom that you can use.

331
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,316
Who?

332
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,953
That creepy guy who just got
out of that

333
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,991
even creepier looking building.

334
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,890
Tara.

335
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,094
I was kidding.

336
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,196
Excuse me?

337
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,263
Yes?

338
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,198
I'm sorry to bother you.

339
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,432
Is there a bathroom in there I
could use?

340
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,034
Sorry, I don't own the place.

341
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,436
I'm not supposed to let anyone
in here.

342
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:39,237
Please, mister, it's an
emergency.

343
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,538
I'll be two seconds.

344
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,975
Honestly, I could get
in a lot of trouble.

345
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,142
Who's gonna know?

346
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:46,978
Just let her use
the bathroom, for god sakes.

347
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,849
She'll make it worth your while.

348
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,649
A friend of yours?

349
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,154
Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk.

350
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:58,023
It's been a long night.

351
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,024
Alright.

352
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,492
Just make it quick, okay?

353
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:01,329
Thank you.

354
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:06,334
Guy's even weirder
looking than the clown was.

355
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:12,840
This way.

356
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,409
Good thing you called me when I
did.

357
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:20,144
I was about to bomb the
hell out of this place.

358
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,045
Bomb?

359
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,147
Bug bomb.

360
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:23,051
Pest control.

361
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,883
What kind of pest?

362
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,384
You sure you want me to tell
you before

363
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,619
you use the bathroom?

364
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,286
Why?

365
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,621
Don't tell me it's roaches.

366
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,656
It's not roaches.

367
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,523
Oh good.

368
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,392
It's rats.

369
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:34,528
Rats?

370
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:38,967
All clear.

371
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:40,932
Are you sure?

372
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,066
Rat free.

373
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,636
What if one crawls out of the
toilet?

374
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,272
I'd make it quick if I were
you.

375
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:48,142
Good plan.

376
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,643
Do you need me to wait for you
or?

377
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,246
I'll be alright.

378
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,614
You remember how we
came in?

379
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,484
I remember.

380
00:21:59,053 --> 00:21:59,919
Okay.

381
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,955
Well, um, you have a nice night
then.

382
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:04,255
You too.

383
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,093
Thanks again.

384
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:07,262
Don't mention it.

385
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,162
Craven's
Halloween Super Store,

386
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,399
the brand new Halloween
super store with over

387
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:50,401
10,000 square feet of
costumes, accessories,

388
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,636
and decorations.

389
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:54,272
Miles County's largest Halloween
store.

390
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:56,574
Kid's costumes, adult costumes,

391
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,442
wigs, hats, and masks.

392
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,678
Makeup, and so much more.

393
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,049
So come in and check
out our huge selection

394
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,553
located at Roma Boulevard.

395
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:10,322
This is
a WNEW breaking news alert.

396
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:13,057
We have a major development
in Miles County this evening,

397
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,761
where authorities are
investigating a double homicide.

398
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:18,130
Two employees at the Deer Hill's
Pizzeria

399
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:21,365
were found brutally
murdered just moments ago.

400
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,801
No suspects are in custody yet

401
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,268
but police are on the look out

402
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,571
for a tall, thin man
wearing a black and white

403
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:30,207
clown costume and carrying
a large garbage bag.

404
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,342
No way.

405
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:32,043
An
eyewitness spotted the suspect

406
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,412
after hearing multiple screams.

407
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,480
No further details at this
moment.

408
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,483
Stay tuned, and we'll
continue to bring you

409
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,755
more breaking updates as
they become available.

410
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:54,299
Oh my god, you're
never gonna believe what

411
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:56,304
I just heard on the radio.

412
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,916
Figures.

413
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,228
Oh, I'm sorry.

414
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,099
Shh.

415
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,236
You don't have to say a word.

416
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,805
Your eyes tell me everything.

417
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,774
I didn't mean to frighten you,
dear.

418
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,244
You must be the new tenant.

419
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:48,216
It's nice to finally meet you.

420
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,786
You're really going to like it
here.

421
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,189
Isn't she, Emily?

422
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,456
This is my daughter, Emily.

423
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,827
Say hello to the pretty young
lady.

424
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:10,735
It's been quite a while
since we've had neighbors.

425
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,505
Perhaps we can do our laundry
together.

426
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:15,442
I could use some good company.

427
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,342
Yes.

428
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,747
That sounds like a good idea.

429
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,549
Will you excuse me a moment?

430
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:26,418
I have to find the landlord.

431
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,891
The first month's rent is due
and I don't wanna be late.

432
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,896
Punctuality is the thief of
time, dear.

433
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,150
Help!

434
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:54,020
Somebody!

435
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:55,989
Please!

436
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,205
Happy
Halloween boys and ghouls.

437
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,941
The current temperature
is a crisp 43 degrees.

438
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,709
The winds are starting to pick
up as well,

439
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,879
setting the tone for old
Samhain.

440
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,813
Now if you're still out and
about in

441
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,850
the Miles County Area, I'd
advise you to be extra careful

442
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:33,551
out there.

443
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:34,919
Police are still on the look out

444
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:36,853
for a man involved in a brutal
slaying

445
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,957
of two employees at Deer
Hill's Pizzeria this morning.

446
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,825
The suspect was last seen
wearing

447
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,695
a black and white clown costume

448
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:45,295
with matching face paint.

449
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,899
If you're just tuning in, this
is not

450
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:48,867
a Halloween prank.

451
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:51,268
The local sheriff has advised
all persons

452
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,670
in the Miles County Area to stay
indoors

453
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,907
and notify authorities if they
see anyone

454
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:58,176
matching the assailant's
description.

455
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:59,046
Really?

456
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:10,383
Mister!

457
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,119
Help me, please.

458
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:15,922
Help me, please.

459
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:22,460
Mister!

460
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:11,203
Come on, motherfucker!

461
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:14,640
Come on!

462
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:22,716
Get up!

463
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,620
Get the fuck up!

464
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:32,392
Get up!

465
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:07,194
Shh.

466
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:09,796
It's alright, mommy.

467
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:13,464
It's only the wind.

468
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:15,699
It can't hurt you.

469
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,304
I won't let anything hurt you.

470
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,638
I guess the new neighbors
weren't such

471
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,576
a good idea after all.

472
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:14,531
Jesus Christ.

473
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:16,098
Can you help me, please?

474
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Who are you? How the
hell did you get in here?

475
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:19,937
You have to come with me now.

476
00:47:19,939 --> 00:47:21,904
There's a dead woman in your
basement.

477
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:22,806
What?

478
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:23,674
Yes.

479
00:47:23,676 --> 00:47:24,507
Dead.

480
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,509
Dead, all dead.

481
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:28,612
He's killing them one by
one by one, like cows.

482
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:30,179
Look, lady.

483
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,380
Lady.

484
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,183
If you don't go away right
now, I'm gonna call the cops.

485
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:34,717
Yes, that's what I've been
saying.

486
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,620
You need to call the
police right away because

487
00:47:36,622 --> 00:47:38,054
he's right downstairs
and he's probably going

488
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:39,922
to kill you, too, if
you don't get somebody

489
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:40,790
down here right away.

490
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:41,824
What the fuck are you talking
about?

491
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,226
The clown with the
white face and the little

492
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,428
black hat.

493
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,562
He thinks what he's doing is
funny because he's laughing.

494
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,199
But I know it's not funny
because they're all dead.

495
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:50,833
Get the hell away from me.

496
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:51,902
I'm telling you.

497
00:47:51,904 --> 00:47:55,105
He knows I know, and he's
gonna try and kill me

498
00:47:55,107 --> 00:47:56,739
before he kills you.

499
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,040
Don't touch me.

500
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:58,708
Don't!

501
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,243
Help me, please, help me.

502
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:01,914
I said, get the hell away from
me!

503
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:11,955
Emily.

504
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:12,826
Emily.

505
00:48:19,265 --> 00:48:20,933
Hello?

506
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:23,069
Is anybody in here?

507
00:48:24,536 --> 00:48:27,140
What The fuck is going on
here?

508
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:48,125
Wow.

509
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,794
Yeah, this better be good, man.

510
00:48:50,796 --> 00:48:51,661
What happened?

511
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:52,564
You burn the place down?

512
00:48:53,966 --> 00:48:54,868
Hello?

513
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:57,203
Mike?

514
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:00,670
Wow, you flipped out?

515
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:01,507
Hello?

516
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:05,875
Yo!

517
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,149
Tara?

518
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,653
Dawn?

519
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:17,055
Hello?

520
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:30,270
No.

521
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:33,839
Emily?

522
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:38,944
Emily?

523
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,049
Okay.

524
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:45,617
You're scaring mommy now.

525
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,171
Hello?

526
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:10,676
Anyone here?

527
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:22,321
Come on, you guys.

528
00:50:24,656 --> 00:50:25,924
Emily, mommy's here.

529
00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:27,727
Where are you?

530
00:50:29,928 --> 00:50:30,797
Emily?

531
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:33,098
Honey?

532
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:53,685
Tara?

533
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:07,899
Give her to me.

534
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:13,339
Please.

535
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,207
Don't hurt my little girl.

536
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,719
You're frightening her.

537
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:29,921
Can't you see that?

538
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:31,790
Emily?

539
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:33,924
It's okay.

540
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:34,794
Mommy's here.

541
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:54,881
Is there kindness in you?

542
00:51:58,149 --> 00:52:00,385
Somewhere in your heart?

543
00:52:05,924 --> 00:52:09,762
Have you ever felt a mother's
touch?

544
00:52:16,935 --> 00:52:18,904
Can you show no mercy?

545
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,777
She's all I have in this world.

546
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:29,415
Spare her.

547
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:11,089
Shh.

548
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,359
It's okay.

549
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:19,332
Shh.

550
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:57,868
Hi, you've reached
Mike.

551
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,002
Of course.

552
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:00,870
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

553
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:02,438
Mike, I'm outside.

554
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,141
Every fuckin' door in
this place is locked.

555
00:54:05,143 --> 00:54:06,379
Answer your phone!

556
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:08,581
Asshole.

557
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:17,055
Hello?

558
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:20,892
Is anybody in there?

559
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:26,565
This is the fucking last time I
do this.

560
00:54:28,634 --> 00:54:31,237
No consideration whatsoever.

561
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:38,276
Dawn?

562
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:49,555
Hello?

563
00:54:51,189 --> 00:54:52,058
Guys.

564
00:55:02,301 --> 00:55:03,466
I know you're in there.

565
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,404
Dawn, I can hear your phone.

566
00:55:17,015 --> 00:55:18,281
I swear to god, if this is a
prank,

567
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:19,652
I'm gonna kill you both.

568
00:55:58,056 --> 00:55:58,925
Tara!

569
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,533
Tara!

570
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:11,336
Can you hear me?

571
00:56:56,348 --> 00:56:58,248
Oh, Tara, Tara, you're okay.
It's okay.

572
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,685
I'm gonna get help.

573
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:03,989
What the fuck?

574
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,625
Oh, it'll be okay.

575
00:57:08,627 --> 00:57:10,363
God, what's going on?

576
00:57:10,629 --> 00:57:12,661
Emily?

577
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:15,066
Help me.

578
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:18,471
Help me.

579
00:57:40,192 --> 00:57:41,794
Somebody please help!

580
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:49,602
Please!

581
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,440
Help!

582
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,446
Somebody please help me!

583
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:23,796
Please, stop it!

584
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,867
No, please leave me alone!

585
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:36,642
Yo, Mike!

586
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:49,655
Son of a bitch.

587
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,829
You're on your own, buddy.

588
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:35,801
Mike!

589
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:52,250
Hello?

590
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:32,116
Come on.

591
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,009
No.

592
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:22,667
You can't be dead, Tara.

593
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:24,703
Fuck, Tara.

594
01:08:27,772 --> 01:08:29,804
Please wake up.

595
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:33,045
No, you can't be dead, Tara,
look at me.

596
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,125
I'm gonna get you out of here.

597
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:28,200
Come on, I'm gonna get
you out of here right now.

598
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:46,981
Oh Jesus, you alright?

599
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:48,053
Stay with me.

600
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:50,953
I'm feeling a little tired.

601
01:09:50,955 --> 01:09:52,487
I know, it's okay.

602
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:54,126
Just relax, it's gonna be fine.

603
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:01,263
There's a phone over there.

604
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:02,597
I'm gonna call the police, okay?

605
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:04,033
No!

606
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:05,133
Please don't leave, don't leave
me.

607
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:07,535
I am not gonna leave you, I
promise.

608
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,904
I'm just going right over there.

609
01:10:08,906 --> 01:10:09,774
Look.

610
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:19,248
911, emergency.

611
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,883
Uh yes, I need the
police

612
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:21,883
and paramedics here right away.

613
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,185
What's wrong, sir?

614
01:10:23,187 --> 01:10:24,119
I wanna report a murder.

615
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:25,286
There's two dead people.

616
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:26,554
I've got this young woman over
here

617
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,423
that's just been assaulted.

618
01:10:27,425 --> 01:10:28,457
She's bleeding everywhere.

619
01:10:28,459 --> 01:10:30,159
I think she's going into shock.

620
01:10:30,161 --> 01:10:31,927
Okay, give me your
address.

621
01:10:31,929 --> 01:10:34,366
Uh, Steuben Street,
it's the old warehouse.

622
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,432
What kind of
injuries does she have?

623
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:38,534
She's cut all over.

624
01:10:38,536 --> 01:10:41,270
Some places really deep.

625
01:10:41,272 --> 01:10:42,937
I don't know, she's
bleeding all over the place.

626
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,138
Is she conscious?

627
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,908
Yes, she conscious, but I have
no idea

628
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:47,075
for how long.

629
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,477
Where is the
assailant now?

630
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:49,881
I knocked him out.

631
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:53,982
If this guy wakes up,
we are not safe here.

632
01:10:53,984 --> 01:10:57,288
This guy is armed and he's
a total fucking maniac.

633
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,121
Okay, sir,
what I want you to do now

634
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:02,391
is just remain calm and
stay on the line with me

635
01:11:02,393 --> 01:11:03,595
until the police arrive.

636
01:11:04,629 --> 01:11:05,494
Look.

637
01:11:05,496 --> 01:11:06,462
We are not staying here.

638
01:11:06,464 --> 01:11:08,230
I'm taking this girl
to the emergency room.

639
01:11:08,232 --> 01:11:10,468
You just get your asses down
here now.

640
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:13,368
I got my truck outside.

641
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,570
Can you walk?

642
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:16,038
Okay.

643
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,240
Come on, let's get out of here.

644
01:11:29,086 --> 01:11:29,955
Dammit!

645
01:11:54,545 --> 01:11:55,480
No, stop!

646
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,646
Stop!

647
01:12:53,537 --> 01:12:54,406
Dammit!

648
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,730
Get away from me!

649
01:13:54,732 --> 01:13:56,100
Leave me alone!

650
01:13:56,834 --> 01:13:58,502
You fucking maniac!

651
01:14:00,104 --> 01:14:03,605
Leave me alone!

652
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:04,743
Stop, stop it!

653
01:16:10,501 --> 01:16:12,801
Police, don't fuckin' move!

654
01:16:12,803 --> 01:16:14,203
Put your hands up right now!

655
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:14,835
Central.

656
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:15,736
10-13, male perp.

657
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:16,605
Possibly armed.

658
01:16:16,607 --> 01:16:17,472
Let me see your hands!

659
01:16:17,474 --> 01:16:18,140
Send more units.

660
01:16:18,142 --> 01:16:19,441
I said show me your hands!

661
01:16:19,443 --> 01:16:20,275
Put 'em up!

662
01:16:20,277 --> 01:16:22,147
I said put your fuckin' hands
up!

663
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,283
That's it, nice and easy.

664
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:29,985
No sudden moves.

665
01:16:29,987 --> 01:16:31,253
Your right hand.

666
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:32,221
Show me the right hand.

667
01:16:32,223 --> 01:16:32,887
Last warning.

668
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:34,224
You're gonna get shot!

669
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:44,268
Do it!

670
01:16:47,638 --> 01:16:48,869
No, no, no!

671
01:16:58,482 --> 01:17:01,816
Central, we got shots fired.

672
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,220
Multiple causalities.

673
01:17:04,455 --> 01:17:07,755
We needed buses and immediate
assistance.

674
01:17:12,563 --> 01:17:13,829
Oh my god.

675
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:14,732
What?

676
01:17:18,669 --> 01:17:20,404
She's still alive.

677
01:17:44,795 --> 01:17:45,793
Aw, come on, guys.

678
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:46,928
You're killin' me.

679
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,500
The revolving doors won't
be installed until Monday.

680
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:51,703
Good to see you, too, doc.

681
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:55,704
Okay, what
are you bringing me?

682
01:17:55,706 --> 01:17:57,739
Murder, suicide.

683
01:17:57,741 --> 01:17:58,906
Wonderful.

684
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:00,741
What's behind showcase number
one?

685
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:02,343
Severe head trauma.

686
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:03,611
You're probably gonna have to
identify

687
01:18:03,613 --> 01:18:05,746
this poor bastard by his teeth,

688
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:07,883
if you can dig them out
of the back of his skull.

689
01:18:07,885 --> 01:18:10,384
So I should put on a seventh
pot of coffee, then, huh?

690
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:11,753
You're gonna need
something a lot stronger

691
01:18:11,755 --> 01:18:12,753
than coffee.

692
01:18:12,755 --> 01:18:15,490
Landon said they just
found two more bodies.

693
01:18:15,492 --> 01:18:17,825
Jesus, they get the sick
fuck that's doing this?

694
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:19,029
Showcase number two.

695
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:22,664
No shit.

696
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:24,665
Police found him eating
the face off of some

697
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:27,668
young girl after he ran
her over with a truck.

698
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:31,940
He blew his brains out before
they could take him in, so.

699
01:18:31,942 --> 01:18:33,709
Halloween never disappoints,
does it?

700
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:35,811
And it looks like it's
just getting started.

701
01:18:35,813 --> 01:18:37,012
Well, seeing as how I'm gonna
be here

702
01:18:37,014 --> 01:18:39,384
for another 24 hours, thanks to
you,

703
01:18:40,084 --> 01:18:41,917
you guys think you could
get me a breakfast sandwich

704
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,985
with bacon, or something with
bacon?

705
01:18:43,987 --> 01:18:45,023
Bacon, really?

706
01:18:46,023 --> 01:18:47,789
I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

707
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:49,024
I am watchin' it.

708
01:18:49,026 --> 01:18:50,491
Watchin' it go up.

709
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:51,826
Who's the MD around here?

710
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:53,594
How can you eat a greasy
croissant while

711
01:18:53,596 --> 01:18:55,530
you're cutting up dead bodies?

712
01:18:55,532 --> 01:18:56,530
Sweetheart.

713
01:18:56,532 --> 01:18:58,566
I've been doin' this 22 years.

714
01:18:58,568 --> 01:18:59,801
Alright, once you've
seen an eight month old

715
01:18:59,803 --> 01:19:00,837
microwaved to death,

716
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:04,442
everything else is just old hat.

717
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,442
Look, you had to ask, alright?

718
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:09,945
I'll hook you up, doc.

719
01:19:09,947 --> 01:19:10,882
That's my guy.

720
01:19:12,683 --> 01:19:14,385
Stay safe out there.

721
01:19:25,395 --> 01:19:26,063
Jesus.

722
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:39,943
Let's have a look at the man of
the hour.

723
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:52,753
I hope your 15 minutes
of fame was worth it,

724
01:19:52,755 --> 01:19:54,424
you sick son of a bitch.

725
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:16,578
You're really
going to like it here.

726
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:03,191
Thanks again for everything,
doctor.

727
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:04,758
You'll be in our prayers.

728
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,895
Please, don't mention it.

729
01:21:06,897 --> 01:21:08,629
We're all gonna miss this one.

730
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:09,998
She's been so cooperative.

731
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,866
Makes everyone laugh.

732
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:13,602
Well she certainly hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

733
01:21:13,604 --> 01:21:15,473
Yeah, still a wise ass.

734
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:17,038
It's good.

735
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,573
It's a good thing.

736
01:21:18,575 --> 01:21:20,174
It's important to stay positive,
right?

737
01:21:20,176 --> 01:21:21,610
Absolutely.

738
01:21:21,612 --> 01:21:22,744
Good spirits.

739
01:21:22,746 --> 01:21:23,648
She'll be fine.

740
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:26,847
Well, take care of yourself,
Victoria.

741
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:28,115
I'll see you in a couple of
months.

742
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:29,049
Thank you, doctor.

743
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:29,920
You're welcome.

744
01:21:30,854 --> 01:21:31,953
So long, doctor.

745
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:32,857
Good bye.

746
01:21:34,925 --> 01:21:36,758
What do you say kiddo?

747
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,625
You ready?

748
01:21:37,627 --> 01:21:38,462
Yep.

749
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:41,295
Oh and, uh, good luck
with

750
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:42,666
your interview tomorrow.

751
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:54,999
