The Institute for the Intellectual
Development of Children Presents

2
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:46,259
<i>This is an aid worker
with the Red Crescent</i>

3
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:49,804
<i>speaking to you today
about adopting a child.</i>

4
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:55,726
<i>We have many children who've lost
their parents and their home.</i>

5
00:00:55,893 --> 00:01:04,443
<i>We need families
who can take these children in.</i>

6
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:09,991
Why was the highway
closed so early?

7
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:12,952
To let ambulances through.

8
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,997
<i>We ask families to contact us here</i>

9
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>at the Red Crescent.</i>

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,714
<i>We're very grateful
for the generous support so far,</i>

11
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:28,092
<i>but more help is needed,</i>

12
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:32,054
<i>because the scale
of the disaster is so great...</i>

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,348
ls the highway open?

14
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:36,767
Cars are going through, right?

15
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,939
Didn't you ask
the same thing yesterday?

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,443
Yesterday I tried to get to Rudbar,

17
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:48,195
but I had to turn around at Manjil.

18
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,947
If you want more information,

19
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:52,617
ask the traffic police.

20
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,608
Would you know
if the highway's open?

21
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:28,486
- <i>Yes. Where are you going?</i>
- Rudbar.

22
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:30,488
<i>The road to Rudbar is open.</i>

23
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,823
Yesterday we had
to turn back at Manjil -

24
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,825
<i>You can't enter Manjil.</i>

25
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,370
<i>Only rescue services are allowed in.</i>

26
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:38,954
Thanks.

27
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:50,966
Dad?

28
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,259
What?

29
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,679
What are rescue services?

30
00:02:55,513 --> 00:03:00,226
The services sent in to help
victims of the earthquake.

31
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:06,107
He said only rescue services
were allowed in.

32
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:08,609
Does it mean we can't get through?

33
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,861
Yes, but <i>I'll</i> think of something.

34
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:13,406
- Like what?
- Just wait.

35
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:15,741
We're not there yet.

36
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:21,205
What if we show them

37
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,126
the pictures of the two boys
and say we're bringing them help.

38
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:27,878
Not a bad idea.

39
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:37,513
Dad, what are those round things?

40
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,224
Communication towers.

41
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,852
They transmit the news.

42
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:46,731
Did they transmit
the news of the earthquake?

43
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:48,399
Of course.

44
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,569
Dad?

45
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:52,862
What?

46
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:55,239
- What's that?
- What?

47
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:58,159
Where the smoke's coming out.

48
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,661
A cement factory.

49
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:04,039
Why didn't it fall down
in the earthquake?

50
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:08,085
Cement's very strong.
Earthquakes can't destroy it.

51
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:13,924
Were their houses
made of cement?

52
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:17,762
No, most are made of clay bricks.

53
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:20,306
You saw that in the movie.

54
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:29,106
Maybe the boys came to Tehran
to see the soccer game.

55
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:31,692
I'm afraid not.

56
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:35,613
Since they don't even have TVs,
they come to Tehran.

57
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:40,826
Scotland played Brazil
that night, right?

58
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,622
Wednesday night...

59
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:47,291
was Argentina and Brazil.

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,336
No, Scotland and Brazil.

61
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:54,298
I saw it.
It was Scotland and Brazil.

62
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:57,134
Scotland and Brazil?

63
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,720
You're right.

64
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,101
I have to go to the bathroom.

65
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:08,229
Hang on.

66
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,025
Go ahead.

67
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:34,732
Look, I caught a grasshopper.

68
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,152
That's not good.

69
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,321
Why not?

70
00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:42,698
They're dirty.

71
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:47,411
If you touch your eyes or mouth now,
it could be bad.

72
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,080
Besides, they belong out in the wild.

73
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,249
Put it out the window.

74
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:55,586
No, I want to raise it.

75
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:58,756
Who ever heard
of raising grasshoppers?

76
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:02,092
<i>I'll</i> be the first person in the world.

77
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:08,432
Catch grasshoppers and raise them?

78
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:10,935
What's the point?

79
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:13,771
<i>I'll</i> raise it so it can emigrate.

80
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,815
- What's that?
- So it can emigrate.

81
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,567
Emigrate?

82
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:21,612
You know what that means?

83
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:25,032
It means to go
from one place to another.

84
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:26,784
Very good.

85
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:33,082
I answered your question.
Now you answer mine.

86
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:36,251
Why do grasshoppers emigrate?

87
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:39,088
I don't know.

88
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:43,342
I know. When they've eaten
all the grass in one place,

89
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:49,473
they move somewhere else
where there's fresh grass.

90
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,434
Understand?

91
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:00,484
Look. It has red wings.

92
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,321
Careful!
We almost hit that truck!

93
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,157
Throw that thing out the window now!

94
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:17,251
I said throw it out the window.

95
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:25,426
Toss it!

96
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,638
Did you do it?
- Yes.

97
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,433
Get some sleep now.

98
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:39,857
Fold up that shirt...

99
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,484
put it under your head...

100
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,737
and rest a bit.

101
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:22,983
Dad?

102
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,778
When do we get to that big tunnel?

103
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,571
It's coming up.

104
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:03,565
AND LIFE GOES ON

105

112
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:37,511
Excuse me, please.

113
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,638
Where's the main road?

114
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:42,891
Straight ahead,
then left at the junction.

115
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:44,559
Thanks.

116
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,791
<i>Keep it moving!</i>

117
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,751
<i>Come on through!</i>

118
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:12,087
<i>Watch the rocks!</i>

119
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:14,715
Keep moving.

120
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:29,493
Dad!

121
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:32,579
Dad!

122
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:38,835
Corning!

123
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:02,085
- Dad, they sell soft drinks there.
- Where?

124
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,629
There was a little store.

125
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,601
Excuse me.

126
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,105
- What?
- You have any soft drinks?

127
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:24,941
What a thing to ask now!

128
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:33,033
Dad, they have soft drinks.

129
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:34,659
Where?

130
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,119
Back there.

131
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:38,788
Hang on.

132
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,645
Excuse me.

133
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:11,655
They don't answer.
Can I just take one?

134
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,990
Okay. Leave the money.

135
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,330
This one's really warm.

136
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:22,749
So is this one.

137
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:25,502
They're all the same.
Just take one.

138
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:39,237
Dad, this soda's really warm.

139
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,155
My stomach hurts.

140
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:43,533
Do I have to drink it all?
- No.

141
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:55,503
<i>Don 'z' pour it all out.
Give me some for my baby.</i>

142
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:05,930
That's good.

143
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:38,546
Stop!

144
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:08,201
Okay, go on. Quickly!

145
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,330
Move on, quickly!

146
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,704
Get going! Don't stop there!

147
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,455
It's overheated.

148
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,666
Get out and push.

149
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,460
You can't block the road.

150
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,964
Go on now!

151
00:25:03,673 --> 00:25:05,675
Keep moving!

152
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:10,805
Move along!

153
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,640
Don't stop.

154
00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:14,892
Quickly!

155
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:30,366
<i>So many villagers have been affected.</i>

156
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:34,078
<i>Many have had to perform
their funeral ablutions</i>

157
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:38,624
<i>for children and other loved ones
in the streamlets.</i>

158
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:44,213
<i>We watch their suffering from afar...</i>

159
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:49,385
<i>and share in their great sorrow.</i>

160
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,223
Excuse me.

161
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:57,560
Excuse me.

162
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:01,064
How far is it backed up like this?

163
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:02,732
It's terrible.

164
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:08,863
It's taken me four hours
from lmamzadeh to here.

165
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:14,494
From the hospital on,
traffic's barely moving.

166
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:18,915
What hospital!
There's no hospital left.

167
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,584
It's a pile of rubble.

168
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,922
I really don't know...

169
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,342
what our people have done

170
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,719
for God to punish us so.

171
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,432
Would you mind backing up

172
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:39,519
so we can try that side road?

173
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,656
Are you sure this is the way?

174
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:36,617
Every road leads somewhere.

175
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,953
What about a dead end?

176
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:45,334
Let's ask someone.

177
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:49,130
Let's ask them.

178
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:59,432
Excuse me.
Does this road go to Koker?

179
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:00,933
I don't know.

180
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,894
Can I give you a ride?

181
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:08,065
No, but could you take
this heavy gas tank up the hill?

182
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:11,402
Just leave it by the road.
Our tent is nearby.

183
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:13,446
Thanks very much.

184
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:16,866
- <i>I'll</i> leave it by the road.
- Thanks again.

185
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:14,423
Excuse me, sir.
Can I get to Koker this way?

186
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:35,820
What's that?

187
00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:38,030
Does this road go to Koker?

188
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:40,324
- I don't know.
- You don't?

189
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:42,451
- No.
- What about Poshteh?

190
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:44,245
- No.
- Thanks anyway.

191
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,871
You're welcome.

192
00:29:52,962 --> 00:29:55,423
Ma'am, how do I get to Koker?

193
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:58,968
Koker?
You have to go the other way.

194
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:02,305
Through Mahal.

195
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,810
There's a road back there.
Take that road.

196
00:30:08,394 --> 00:30:10,271
That road's closed.

197
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:12,231
İsn't there another way?

198
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:15,776
- You have to go through Mahal.
- Thanks very much.

199
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:21,615
What do we do now, Dad?

200
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:23,701
We'll think of something.

201
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:25,828
I don't know yet.

202
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:04,367
Excuse me.
Do you know the way to Koker?

203
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:06,369
- No.
- And Poshteh?

204
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:09,163
- No.
- This isn't the way to Poshteh?

205
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:13,793
Everyone's buried in the rubble.

206
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,633
My poor little house is in ruins.
I'm desperate and miserable.

207
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,970
May God give you strength.

208
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:28,557
Do you know if there were
many victims in Koker?

209
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,935
I don't know.

210
00:31:31,394 --> 00:31:33,729
Thank you very much.

211
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:36,315
God bless you and keep you

212
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,234
safe and sound.

213
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,266
Does this road go to Koker?

214
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:12,143
I don't know.

215
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:14,603
- Where are you going?
- Koker.

216
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:18,274
You can't take the side road.
Go back to the paved road.

217
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:22,778
That road's blocked.
Isn't there some other way?

218
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:26,574
Yes, but big fissures
have opened up.

219
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:29,243
You won't make it in this car.

220
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:31,537
The road's too damaged.

221
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:33,956
Thanks.
We'll see how it goes.

222
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,619
Now which way do we go?

223
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:56,372
We'll find a road.

224
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:03,128
Let's ask him.

225
00:34:07,174 --> 00:34:09,718
Excuse me.
The road to Koker?

226
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:11,804
This is the road...

227
00:34:12,596 --> 00:34:15,558
but there was a landslide
in the mountains.

228
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:18,644
I doubt you can get through.

229
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:21,146
- Are you from Koker?
- Yes.

230
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:22,481
Any news?

231
00:34:23,232 --> 00:34:25,359
Koker is a total ruin.

232
00:34:25,484 --> 00:34:28,195
Not a house was left standing.

233
00:34:28,654 --> 00:34:30,531
Everything's destroyed.

234
00:34:31,198 --> 00:34:32,825
Do you know this boy?

235
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,578
- Him?
- Yes.

236
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:38,914
- Yes, I know him.
- Who is he?

237
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,587
He's the son of Abdollah in Koker.

238
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:46,589
He was in a movie.

239
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:49,550
You know if he survived?

240
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:54,013
I don't know.
I have no news about anyone.

241
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:58,642
Are you headed for Koker?
<i>I'll</i> give you a ride.

242
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:02,438
Thanks, but <i>I'll</i> walk.
You could too. It's not far.

243
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:04,231
We'll drive there together.

244
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:06,609
Thanks, but <i>I'll</i> walk.

245
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:09,278
You won't get through by car.

246
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:13,782
Go back to the main road,

247
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:18,120
then take the dirt road on your right.

248
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:22,082
If that's open, you can get through.

249
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,210
Anything else?
- No. Thanks a lot.

250
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:50,123
Excuse me.
Which way is Koker?

251
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:53,210
- Hassan, is Koker that way?
- No, the other way.

252
00:38:53,335 --> 00:38:54,628
That way.

253
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:56,129
Thanks.

254
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:32,541
- Thanks so much.
- How are you, Mr. Rouhi?

255
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,460
- Fine, thanks.
- You remember me?

256
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:38,171
You know me from somewhere?

257
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:39,965
You don't recognize me?

258
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,717
<i>No.</i>

259
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:45,387
<i>Wait... of course!</i>

260
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:47,848
- Remember now?
- Yes.

261
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,435
Thank God you weren't harmed
in the earthquake.

262
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,730
We suffered
a lot of structural damage,

263
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:57,107
but not many casualties.

264
00:39:57,232 --> 00:40:00,652
By the grace of God,
we're all alive.

265
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:04,698
- Any news of the Ahmadpours?
- The Ahmadpours?

266
00:40:05,324 --> 00:40:08,160
The boys in the movie with you.

267
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:12,289
They're not from my village.
They're from Koker.

268
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:14,082
Yes, I know.

269
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:17,002
Is there a road to Koker around here?

270
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:20,130
There was a direct road before,

271
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:23,091
but who knows now?

272
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:26,094
What a thing to buy right now!

273
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:28,263
Where are you taking it?

274
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:32,601
It would be impolite
to say why I bought it.

275
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,646
It's clear enough what it's for!

276
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:38,440
Those who died died,

277
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:41,026
and those who survived

278
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:44,529
need this valuable piece of ceramic.

279
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:48,116
Use it in good health!

280
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:50,619
Thank you very much.

281
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:55,040
I don't know why

282
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:59,503
so many innocent children
and tiny babies

283
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:03,006
and poor people lost their homes

284
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:06,051
while our house was left standing.

285
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:08,929
Was the Lord looking out for me?

286
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:12,391
Do you think you're blessed?

287
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:15,936
Those are just words.

288
00:41:16,144 --> 00:41:18,313
Then how do you explain it?

289
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:21,608
The way I see it...

290
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:24,987
this disaster fell upon us

291
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:27,531
like a hungry wolf.

292
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:31,535
Those in its path were devoured

293
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,246
while the rest were spared.

294
00:41:34,454 --> 00:41:36,456
No, this wasn't God's doing.

295
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,875
- Mr. Rouhi?
- Yes?

296
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:41,586
<i>In Where ls the Friend's House ?,</i>

297
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:44,715
why were you older
and humpbacked?

298
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,217
Those people...

299
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:51,179
put that hump on me.

300
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:56,143
And they told me,
“You have to look older.”

301
00:41:56,476 --> 00:42:01,023
I said,
“Fine, whatever you say.”

302
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:04,568
But I didn't like it.

303
00:42:05,152 --> 00:42:07,362
It didn't sit right with me.

304
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,075
I don't know what kind of art it is

305
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:14,995
that makes people look older

306
00:42:15,704 --> 00:42:17,789
and uglier than they are.

307
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:23,378
Art is making people look
a little younger.

308
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:28,425
Making the young
look older isn't art.

309
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,554
Thank God you're still alive,
and still looking young.

310
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:38,143
No one appreciates youth
until they grow old...

311
00:42:39,394 --> 00:42:43,982
or life until they stare death
in the face.

312
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:48,445
If the dead could come back

313
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,573
and live again...

314
00:42:51,907 --> 00:42:55,035
they'd surely live better lives.

315
00:42:56,328 --> 00:42:59,122
I get out right here.

316
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:01,166
Right here.

317
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,836
Thanks so much.
You've been very kind.

318
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,932
Would you have
some water for my son?

319
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,975
Sure, sure.

320
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:35,784
Will my car be in the way there?

321
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:38,453
No, cars don't come through here.

322
00:43:45,252 --> 00:43:49,089
Let me help you with that.
It's heavy.

323
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:52,467
Give it to me and lead the way.

324
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,931
Is this your house?
- Yes.

325
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:03,937
I expected to see you
in that other house.

326
00:44:04,312 --> 00:44:07,232
That was my house in the movie.

327
00:44:07,691 --> 00:44:09,776
It was only temporary.

328
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,113
Thanks very much.

329
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:15,615
Sorry for the bother.

330
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:18,118
And to be honest...

331
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:20,829
this house you see here

332
00:44:20,954 --> 00:44:23,665
isn't my real house either.

333
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,792
That must be the oven.

334
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:28,837
This is my “movie house” too.

335
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:33,175
The movie people said,
“This will be your house,”

336
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:35,177
and I said all right.

337
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:38,013
<i>The</i> fact <i>is...</i>

338
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:42,517
my real house was destroyed
in the earthquake.

339
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:47,522
For now we're living
in one of those tents you saw -

340
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,108
Dad, what's this?

341
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:52,360
That's where they cook.

342
00:44:55,197 --> 00:44:59,367
But this house is still standing.
That's a fact too.

343
00:44:59,618 --> 00:45:02,954
Yes, you have a point.

344
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:07,792
A film has its own truth.
It doesn't lie.

345
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,170
The doors are all locked.

346
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:12,464
I'm looking for a bowl.

347
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:16,218
I can't find a bowl
to give your son a drink.

348
00:45:16,343 --> 00:45:18,845
Sir, where's that bowl?

349
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,348
<i>Go hand him the bowl.</i>

350
00:45:21,473 --> 00:45:24,434
Thank you very much.

351
00:45:25,143 --> 00:45:26,853
Thank you.

352
00:45:52,212 --> 00:45:54,839
Where's your son?
He wanted a drink.

353
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:56,967
He's around somewhere.

354
00:45:57,342 --> 00:45:59,761
Sit down. Let's have a chat.

355
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:31,644
How many times
must I clean you up?

356
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:35,065
Just look at you!

357
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,901
- Hello.
- Hello.

358
00:47:48,203 --> 00:47:50,246
Is this water for drinking?

359
00:47:51,373 --> 00:47:52,707
Yes.

360
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:58,755
It's from a spring.
- Why is it from a faucet?

361
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,091
We ran pipes to the spring.

362
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:05,553
Pouya!

363
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,059
What?

364
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:12,894
Where are you?

365
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:15,980
I'm getting some water.

366
00:48:16,231 --> 00:48:18,733
Mr. Rouhi has some for you.

367
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:21,152
I already found some.

368
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:23,238
Don't wander off.

369
00:48:23,488 --> 00:48:26,032
Stay around here.
- Okay.

370
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:28,284
Hello.

371
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:40,296
Were you at your uncle's?

372
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:42,757
No, I was waiting for this plaster.

373
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:46,553
- And your other uncle?
- He wasn't home.

374
00:49:01,651 --> 00:49:05,155
This lamp is all that's left.
Go wash it off.

375
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:07,490
Why's the faucet on?

376
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:11,619
I told you not to leave the faucet on!

377
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:15,790
Wash it off in the spring.

378
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:35,477
Give it here. You'll break it.

379
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:48,823
Go get me a broom.

380
00:49:56,456 --> 00:49:59,292
- Where'd you put my socks?
- On the shelf.

381
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:00,877
I can't find them.

382
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:02,378
I'm coming.

383
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:05,006
- I'm in a hurry.
- I'm coming.

384
00:50:09,344 --> 00:50:11,679
Ma'am, is this drinking water?

385
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:13,181
Yes.

386
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:16,768
It's spring water.

387
00:50:16,893 --> 00:50:20,647
- Why is it from a faucet?
- We laid pipes recently.

388
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:33,701
Pour some here.

389
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,457
Here.

390
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:42,335
I'm pouring where you say.

391
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,379
Right here!

392
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,262
Ma'am, that rug
is buried in debris.

393
00:52:16,387 --> 00:52:19,182
How are you going to pull it up?

394
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:21,559
- What else can I do?
- It's too heavy.

395
00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:24,604
- I have no one else.
- No husband or son?

396
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:27,649
My husband's buried under the rubble.
My son's not here.

397
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:29,525
What about neighbors?

398
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:33,321
They have their own problems.

399
00:52:33,446 --> 00:52:37,325
I have a bad back.
Otherwise I'd pull it out.

400
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:39,327
It's too heavy.

401
00:52:40,495 --> 00:52:42,330
It won't budge.

402
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:46,834
Sir, can you get my kettle?

403
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:51,798
I can't get your rug out,
but <i>I'll</i> try to get your kettle.

404
00:52:51,923 --> 00:52:53,675
Thanks very much.

405
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:56,761
I haven't had any tea in three days.

406
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:58,596
Mash Khatoon!

407
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,020
Mash Khatoon!

408
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,689
Yes.

409
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:10,233
Come here.

410
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:14,570
Hossein will be there to help you.

411
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:18,991
Hossein's busy with his own work.

412
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:22,578
Everyone has their own problems.

413
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:24,872
There's no one to help.

414
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:27,166
You're too old to be doing that.

415
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:31,129
What can I do?
<i>I'll</i> have to dig it out myself.

416
00:53:31,254 --> 00:53:33,381
We'll find someone to help.

417
00:53:33,506 --> 00:53:35,967
There's no one!

418
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:37,927
Everyone's gone.

419
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:45,518
Here's your kettle,
still in one piece.

420
00:53:45,643 --> 00:53:49,230
But I can't get your rug out
with my bad back.

421
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:51,774
- Are you from around here?
- No.

422
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:56,070
- Are you from Tehran?
- Yes.

423
00:53:56,404 --> 00:53:59,282
City people usually
come here on vacation.

424
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:02,326
What brings you here now?

425
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:10,793
Amin, didn't I warn you?

426
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:13,045
Sit down and don't move!

427
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:16,841
I've told you a hundred times
not to do such things!

428
00:54:16,966 --> 00:54:19,719
Now you broke the lantern!

429
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:23,765
If another earthquake comes,
we'll have no lantern!

430
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:29,771
I've told you a hundred times!
Sit down and don't move!

431
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:39,071
Naughty boy!

432
00:54:39,405 --> 00:54:41,324
Spoiled little brat!

433
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:44,035
Mommy.

434
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,621
Shut up!

435
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:52,960
- Mommy.
- Shut up!

436
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:57,215
Your house wasn't damaged too bad.

437
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,136
The outside looks okay,
but the walls are all cracked.

438
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:07,016
A few cracks don't matter.

439
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:09,101
Mr. Rouhi's house looks okay too.

440
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:11,020
Which is his?

441
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,231
A big blue house.

442
00:55:13,356 --> 00:55:15,441
It even has an oven.

443
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:19,403
It has two faucets.
One is upstairs.

444
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:22,031
That's Ali Gholamfs house.

445
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:25,993
They were off visiting relatives
and were buried in the quake.

446
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:34,794
Had they gone to watch
the soccer game?

447
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:37,505
No, they didn't like soccer.

448
00:56:09,787 --> 00:56:12,999
Thank God your children survived.

449
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:16,002
The three who were with me
are all right,

450
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,921
but my oldest daughter
was visiting my parents,

451
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,090
and she died in the quake.

452
00:56:22,842 --> 00:56:25,052
It was God's will.

453
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,849
God doesn't enjoy killing people.

454
00:56:33,686 --> 00:56:36,188
If it wasn't him, who was it?

455
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:38,232
The earthquake.

456
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:42,028
She was going
to start school this year.

457
00:56:42,153 --> 00:56:44,238
It wasn't God.

458
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:46,782
The earthquake is like a mad dog.

459
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:50,411
Those in its path are destroyed,

460
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:53,915
and the rest are spared.

461
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:59,378
Your daughter's lucky she died.

462
00:56:59,629 --> 00:57:04,258
She'll never have to do homework.

463
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:07,929
You've heard the story of Abraham

464
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:11,766
who was about
to sacrifice his son, right?

465
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:15,061
He was going to kill him

466
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:17,772
with a sword...

467
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:21,525
just as God had ordered him to.

468
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:26,906
But just as he readied the sword,

469
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:29,450
God sent him a lamb

470
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,452
to sacrifice instead.

471
00:57:31,911 --> 00:57:37,166
So how could God
have killed your little girl

472
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:39,460
whose life was just beginning?

473
00:57:39,627 --> 00:57:41,587
I think if people died

474
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:45,216
and then came back to life,

475
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:48,636
they'd appreciate life more.

476
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:51,639
So I think
your children who survived

477
00:57:51,764 --> 00:57:54,308
might even appreciate life more.

478
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:58,104
Where did you learn all that?

479
00:57:59,105 --> 00:58:01,732
I learned half
from my history book,

480
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:05,695
half from Mr. Rouhi,
and half I thought of myself.

481
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:08,823
- Pouya?
- Yes.

482
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,326
- What are you doing?
- Talking.

483
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:14,829
Come out where I can see you.

484
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,047
Who are you talking to?

485
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:27,925
He's talking to me.

486
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,511
Fine. You can stay there.

487
00:58:52,158 --> 00:58:55,619
- Did you find my socks?
- I'd have put them on the shelf.

488
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:57,830
Go look in your shoes.

489
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:00,124
In my shoes?

490
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,586
I don't think they're there.

491
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:16,098
I found them.

492
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:21,771
- You seem like newlyweds.
- We are.

493
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:24,565
- How long has it been?
- Five days.

494
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:26,901
Five days or five months?

495
00:59:27,026 --> 00:59:28,402
Five days.

496
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:30,613
Not five months.

497
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,908
The night of the earthquake?

498
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,036
<i>No.</i>

499
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,581
The next day.

500
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:45,878
What are you doing?

501
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,713
Watering the flowers.

502
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:50,591
You got this gentleman wet.

503
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,095
Watch what you're doing
and look first!

504
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:56,639
I'm just watering.

505
00:59:56,764 --> 00:59:58,724
You can do that later.

506
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,771
Check down below first.

507
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:06,357
With roofs caving in
on people's heads,

508
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:09,151
a little water
falling on mine is nothing.

509
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,861
But tell me:

510
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:14,949
You can't have lost much family
if you married the next day.

511
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:17,201
Sure, we lost lots:

512
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:21,622
aunts, uncles, cousins.

513
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:24,041
All told, we lost...

514
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,168
about 65 relatives.

515
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,462
How could you get married?

516
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:32,716
We were already engaged.

517
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:38,347
We were supposed
to marry a few days later

518
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:40,641
and move to our house.

519
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:45,604
But the earthquake killed
so many of our relatives

520
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:49,024
that we decided to get married

521
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,403
without waiting
for our elders' permission.

522
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,614
Otherwise we'd have had to wait

523
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:58,701
for all the various
mourning periods to be over.

524
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:03,122
So we decided
to just get it done with.

525
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:06,667
And you brought your bride here?

526
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:08,669
No, this house isn't ours.

527
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:12,840
We spent three nights
under plastic.

528
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:17,219
We've only been here two nights.
- Under plastic?

529
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,596
What do you mean?

530
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:21,849
I'd bought 20 yards of plastic
for the rice fields.

531
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,143
I put it up on four stakes

532
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:27,354
and it became our tent.

533
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:30,733
- Your nuptial chamber, huh?
- Right.

534
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:35,321
Then I went to my father's house

535
01:01:35,446 --> 01:01:39,366
to see if I could find
anything to eat in the rubble.

536
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:41,702
But I found nothing,

537
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:45,414
just two spoons,
a plate, and a pot.

538
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:49,043
I took them to our plastic shelter
and washed them.

539
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:53,255
Then I went to the market,
where I saw two trucks.

540
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,383
One was handing out tents,

541
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,052
the other tomatoes.

542
01:01:58,219 --> 01:02:00,346
By the time it was my turn,

543
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:04,975
there were no more tents,
but I got a few tomatoes.

544
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:09,647
I took them to our “home”
and washed and skewered them,

545
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:14,735
and we grilled them
like kabob for dinner.

546
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:17,780
- Your wedding banquet.
- Right.

547
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:21,575
We wanted to get on
with starting a family.

548
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:24,912
Those who died didn't know
what was coming.

549
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:28,123
We decided to enjoy life
while we could.

550
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:31,126
The next earthquake
might kill us too.

551
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:34,296
Am I wrong?
- No, you're right.

552
01:02:35,756 --> 01:02:37,549
Hossein, you forgot this.

553
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:40,636
And fix your collar.

554
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:42,888
Good-bye.

555
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:55,317
Hello, ma'am.

556
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:58,904
Don't touch anything.
I'll come by later to help.

557
01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:02,199
I'm leaving you
a few tomatoes out here.

558
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:04,410
Thanks very much.

559
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,315
Pouya!

560
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:38,068
He's gone.

561
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,529
Where did he go?

562
01:03:40,946 --> 01:03:43,157
That way, a few minutes ago.

563
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:46,952
- I see...
- Is that your son?

564
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:49,913
- May I come up to call him?
- Yes.

565
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:55,711
Hello.

566
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:57,796
Is that him?
- Sure is.

567
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:38,420
Good-bye.

568
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:41,882
- Dad, know who I just saw?
- Later.

569
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:44,385
We're blocking the road. Hurry!

570
01:04:44,802 --> 01:04:46,637
Come on!

571
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:12,704
Get out of the way!

572
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:16,166
We're very busy,
and you're blocking the road!

573
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:18,919
What do you think you're doing?

574
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:33,475
- Are you in?
- Yes.

575
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:36,228
Can I tell you now?

576
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:45,696
Hang on.
We really kept that guy waiting.

577
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:51,034
<i>I'll</i> let him pass.

578
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:02,921
Now tell me.

579
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:06,133
I saw the boy

580
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:09,261
who was in the movie.

581
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:11,305
What boy?

582
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:16,810
<i>The one</i> whose <i>back</i> hurt <i>in
Where ls the Friend's House ?</i>

583
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,812
With the green eyes.

584
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:20,856
Mohammad Reza Parvaneh?

585
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:22,983
Yes, him.

586
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:27,696
The boy with green eyes.
- Sure it was him?

587
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:31,283
Yes, he was right in front of me.

588
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:33,577
I could see his green eyes.

589
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:35,579
He's bigger now.

590
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:38,248
Why didn't you talk to him?

591
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:40,417
I didn't know -

592
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:43,378
Look, there he is!

593
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,339
It's him all right.

594
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:02,606
How are you, Mohammad Reza?

595
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,233
Get in.

596
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,336
How are you?
What are you doing here?

597
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:28,215
What's that you've got?
- A pick for digging in the rubble.

598
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:30,384
What?

599
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,803
A pick to dig in the rubble.

600
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,723
Was your house destroyed?

601
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,269
Yes.

602
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:43,021
Where was your house?

603
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,899
Down in Poshteh.

604
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:48,068
Just past the tents.

605
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:50,529
Any news of the Ahmadpours?

606
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:54,908
The Ahmadpours? They're in Koker.

607
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:58,245
I know. But is there any news?

608
01:07:58,453 --> 01:07:59,663
<i>No.</i>

609
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:01,331
How can that be?

610
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:05,460
The road to Koker just reopened.

611
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:11,258
You've grown!

612
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:14,928
Everyone does. Everyone grows up!

613
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:23,729
How did you manage to survive?

614
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:26,607
Tell me.

615
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:29,109
We'd gone to our uncle's.

616
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:33,989
And what happened?

617
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:36,950
- Did you go to watch the game?
- Yes.

618
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:40,203
Who played that night?

619
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:43,498
Brazil and Scotland.

620
01:08:45,584 --> 01:08:47,419
See,Dad?

621
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:50,839
I told you
Brazil played Scotland that night.

622
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:54,468
You were right. Go on.

623
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:57,137
Tell us more.

624
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,807
Scotland scored first.

625
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,977
I mean the earthquake, not the game.

626
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,648
It happened all of a sudden.

627
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:10,025
The roof caved in on us,

628
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:12,319
and we ran outside.

629
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:17,574
The walls in the courtyard collapsed.

630
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:22,329
There was so much dust everywhere

631
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:24,539
that we couldn't see a thing.

632
01:09:24,665 --> 01:09:28,001
We knew where Uncle was sleeping.

633
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:31,004
We went to look for him.

634
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,548
We cleared away bricks and rubble

635
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:36,635
and pulled a piece of iron off him.

636
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:40,305
Then we dragged him outside,

637
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,432
but he was already dead.

638
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,728
And you know nothing
about the Ahmadpours?

639
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,189
They're in Koker.

640
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:51,274
I know they're in Koker.

641
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,278
Does this road go to Koker?

642
01:09:55,946 --> 01:09:59,908
Yes, there's a turnoff
right by our tents.

643
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:06,456
Could you watch the game
the night after the quake?

644
01:10:06,665 --> 01:10:10,460
No, everything was smashed up.

645
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:13,839
Is your TV set so broken

646
01:10:13,964 --> 01:10:16,633
that you can't watch TV?

647
01:10:16,883 --> 01:10:18,427
It's really broken.

648
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,554
What's wrong with it?

649
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:22,556
The screen's all shattered.

650
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:33,024
Who do you think
will go to the finals?

651
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:35,694
I figure Germany.

652
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,655
I think it'll be Brazil.

653
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:40,866
I think Germany.

654
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:42,576
I say Brazil.

655
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:44,745
You wanna bet?

656
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:47,748
Sure.

657
01:10:47,914 --> 01:10:49,833
What should we bet?

658
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,588
A ball.

659
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:58,633
A Ping-Pong ball.

660
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:02,345
That's nothing.

661
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:04,473
Let's bet a soccer ball.

662
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:12,647
I know Brazil will win.

663
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,776
I know Germany will win.

664
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:19,696
I think Brazil will win.
Just wait and see.

665
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:22,115
Let's make a better wager.

666
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:24,451
Like what?

667
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:26,119
Lots of things.

668
01:11:26,244 --> 01:11:28,330
We could bet a bike.

669
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:32,709
You sure make odd bets!

670
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,796
What do you want to bet then?

671
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:42,928
- A pair of socks.
- That's nothing!

672
01:11:46,973 --> 01:11:50,060
A notebook... a little notebook.

673
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,188
That's not much either.

674
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:55,524
Let's bet something else.

675
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:57,943
There are our tents.

676
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:00,737
How do we get to Koker?

677
01:12:00,862 --> 01:12:02,572
Turn left here.

678
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,659
Is there water here?

679
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:08,078
There's a spring right there.

680
01:12:20,298 --> 01:12:21,925
Hello, girls.

681
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:24,469
I need some water for my car.

682
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:27,013
Could you give me some?

683
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,353
No, this water here is fine.

684
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,397
It's just for the car.

685
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:39,401
Thanks a lot.

686
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:46,992
Pouya, pop the hood.

687
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:50,036
Pouya! Pop the hood.

688
01:13:17,063 --> 01:13:18,565
Thanks a lot.

689
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,954
- Where are they coming from?
- Poshteh.

690
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:37,083
- İsn't Poshteh that way?
- The bridge is out.

691
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,461
- Are you two from Poshteh?
- Yes.

692
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:42,255
- Did it suffer much damage?
- Yes.

693
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:44,591
Where's your house?

694
01:13:44,966 --> 01:13:47,928
We live in the second tent.

695
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,764
No, your real house.

696
01:13:51,097 --> 01:13:53,433
Over there...

697
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:56,102
near that tall pine tree.

698
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:57,938
The black pine?

699
01:13:58,772 --> 01:14:02,108
The house
with the black pine in front.

700
01:14:04,152 --> 01:14:05,779
Where's your house?

701
01:14:06,112 --> 01:14:08,782
It was destroyed.
There's nothing left.

702
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:11,034
There's nothing left to see.

703
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:13,954
- Was it in Poshteh?
- Yes.

704
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,122
Did many die in Poshteh?

705
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:18,500
I don't know.

706
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:21,962
We were at our uncle's.
His house collapsed.

707
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:25,465
- Did anyone die there?
- My uncle.

708
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:29,469
Are you Parvaneh's sister?

709
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:32,138
- Yes.
- What a resemblance!

710
01:14:36,142 --> 01:14:39,729
Pouya, don't go far.
We're leaving soon.

711
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:42,482
Did you lose anyone?

712
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,277
- Two people.
- Who?

713
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:48,613
My brother and sister.

714
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:51,574
How did you survive? Tell me.

715
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:56,830
Tell me.

716
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:06,840
You don't remember?

717
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:12,345
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

718
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:15,515
When the earthquake came...

719
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,851
the falling debris didn't hit me.

720
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:20,311
One beam fell above me,

721
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:23,231
two fell to my left,

722
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:26,067
and two to my right.

723
01:15:26,192 --> 01:15:28,737
I was lying on top of a rock.

724
01:15:29,362 --> 01:15:32,323
I spent the night

725
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:35,076
trapped in that space.

726
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:38,621
At dawn I felt a breeze come in...

727
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:42,584
and my uncle came and got me out.

728
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:44,586
And your brother and sister?

729
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:46,713
My sister...

730
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:50,967
- Dad?
- What?

731
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:54,345
What is it? Be careful.

732
01:15:54,554 --> 01:15:57,223
Dad, I want to stay here.

733
01:15:57,348 --> 01:15:58,892
Why?

734
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:01,227
They're putting up a TV antenna!

735
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:03,396
Come see!

736
01:16:08,568 --> 01:16:11,696
Argentina's playing Brazil.

737
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:14,574
They're putting an antenna

738
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:16,951
up on the hill.

739
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,662
They have a TV here too.

740
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:24,751
The picture's not clear!
Turn the antenna!

741
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:30,465
A bit more!

742
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,094
See,Dad?

743
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:36,554
Yes.

744
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:40,975
Can I stay?

745
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:44,270
I can't just leave you on your own.

746
01:16:44,437 --> 01:16:46,356
I want to watch the game.

747
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:49,526
Come back for me later.

748
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,153
I may not come back this way.

749
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,405
This is the only road to Koker.

750
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:56,282
There's no other road.

751
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:59,828
I thought there was another road.

752
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:03,081
- That road was destroyed.
- It was?

753
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:04,707
Let him stay.

754
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,127
You're sure?
You'll look after him?

755
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,172
- Yes.
- Then I leave him in your hands.

756
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:14,134
- Thanks!
- Behave yourself.

757
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:35,071
Good-bye now.

758
01:17:58,344 --> 01:18:01,472
Give this to my son
in case he's cold.

759
01:18:01,598 --> 01:18:04,893
<i>I'll</i> be back in an hour or so.
- All right.

760
01:18:55,318 --> 01:18:58,738
Hello there. Would you know
when the game starts?

761
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:01,366
- 7:00.
- When is it over?

762
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:03,243
Around 9:00.

763
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:05,578
But we already know who'll win.

764
01:19:05,703 --> 01:19:07,747
Actually, I'm no soccer fan.

765
01:19:07,872 --> 01:19:09,916
I left my son back there.

766
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:13,419
I'm going to Koker,
then coming back to get him.

767
01:19:13,586 --> 01:19:16,589
You're driving to Koker?
In this car?

768
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:20,510
There are dangerous curves.
I don't think you'll make it.

769
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:24,430
I have no choice.
This is the only car I have.

770
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:27,767
May I ask you something?

771
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:31,145
With the earthquake
and all the mourning,

772
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:33,273
you're going to watch the game?

773
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:35,942
I'm in mourning too.

774
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:40,780
I lost my little sister
and three nieces and nephews.

775
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:42,824
But what can we do?

776
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:45,535
The World Cup comes
once every four years,

777
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,537
and life goes on.

778
01:19:47,662 --> 01:19:50,290
And an earthquake
is once every 40 years.

779
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,667
It's all in the Lord's hands.

780
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:54,752
Tell me: How far is Koker?

781
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:58,756
Twenty minutes by car.
Forty on foot.

782
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:01,009
- Are you from Koker?
- Sort of.

783
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:05,430
I'm from here, and Koker,
and all around these parts.

784
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:07,640
Tell me: You know this boy?

785
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:11,769
Sure. That's Abdollah's son.

786
01:20:12,353 --> 01:20:14,105
He was in the movie.

787
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:17,108
He and his brother walked by
just 20 minutes ago.

788
01:20:17,233 --> 01:20:19,152
You're sure it was them?

789
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:22,196
Absolutely.
I know all the kids around here.

790
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:24,365
They'd been to the bazaar.

791
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:28,536
They're just over those hills now,
carrying an oil heater.

792
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:31,622
You can catch them if you hurry.

793
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:33,624
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

794
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,085
Hello.

795
01:21:59,252 --> 01:22:01,212
Could we get a ride to Juban?

796
01:22:01,337 --> 01:22:04,132
I'm going to Koker, not Juban.

797
01:22:04,257 --> 01:22:06,426
To the crossroads, then?

798
01:22:06,592 --> 01:22:08,386
Sure. Get in.

799
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:38,583
Have you seen two boys
with an oil heater?

800
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,793
We're carrying one ourselves.

801
01:22:41,335 --> 01:22:44,464
I can see that.
I meant two other boys.

802
01:22:44,922 --> 01:22:47,884
Where are you coming from?
- I'm from lmamzadeh.

803
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:50,428
No, I mean now, on foot.

804
01:22:50,553 --> 01:22:52,555
From the main road.

805
01:22:53,097 --> 01:22:55,224
And where are you going?

806
01:22:55,641 --> 01:22:57,518
Juban.

807
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:01,147
- How far is that?
- Two miles.

808
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:03,566
Twenty miles? On foot?

809
01:23:03,691 --> 01:23:05,776
No, I said two miles.

810
01:23:05,902 --> 01:23:07,487
I see.

811
01:23:07,653 --> 01:23:10,114
And how far is Koker from Juban?

812
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:14,160
- Not far at all.
- Not far, huh?

813
01:23:14,327 --> 01:23:15,703
<i>No.</i>

814
01:23:16,829 --> 01:23:18,706
Where are you from?

815
01:23:18,956 --> 01:23:22,335
I'm from lmamzadeh,
but he's from Juban.

816
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:26,714
You're from Juban?

817
01:23:27,673 --> 01:23:29,926
And you say Juban's near Koker?

818
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:31,636
Yes.

819
01:23:31,761 --> 01:23:35,556
- So you must have news of Koker.
- No, I don't.

820
01:23:35,848 --> 01:23:41,270
The day after the earthquake,
my uncle took me to lmamzadeh.

821
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:43,898
I've heard nothing about Koker since.

822
01:23:44,774 --> 01:23:46,776
Do you know this boy?

823
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:54,742
<i>This is</i> Babak <i>Ahmadpour from
Where ls the Friend's House ?</i>

824
01:23:54,867 --> 01:23:59,038
- So you saw the film?
- I was even in it.

825
01:23:59,205 --> 01:24:01,207
And where did you see it?

826
01:24:01,707 --> 01:24:03,834
After I passed my exams,

827
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,212
my dad took me to Tehran.

828
01:24:06,879 --> 01:24:09,840
I saw it at the Cinema Kanoon.

829
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:16,556
- What part did you play?
- I was in the third row in class...

830
01:24:17,056 --> 01:24:20,768
with my chin in my hands
and a missing front tooth.

831
01:24:20,893 --> 01:24:22,019
What's your name?

832
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:25,064
Yousef Barangi.

833
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,401
So no news of the Ahmadpours?

834
01:24:28,568 --> 01:24:32,405
No, my mom was sick,
so my uncle took us to lmamzadeh.

835
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:35,324
- What happened to your voice?
- It's from shouting.

836
01:24:36,576 --> 01:24:38,578
Were you trapped under rubble?

837
01:24:38,744 --> 01:24:40,746
No, but my brother was.

838
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:44,500
Tell me what happened.

839
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:48,212
My brother and I
were sleeping in the bedroom.

840
01:24:48,337 --> 01:24:50,506
My parents were outside.

841
01:24:51,424 --> 01:24:54,594
The mosquitoes kept biting me,
so I asked

842
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,929
if I could sleep next to my morn.

843
01:24:57,054 --> 01:24:59,932
Just as she lifted
the mosquito net for <i>me...</i>

844
01:25:00,057 --> 01:25:02,018
the earthquake hit.

845
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:05,855
- And your brother was trapped?
- Yes, in the bedroom.

846
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:08,274
- But you were saved.
- Yes.

847
01:25:08,524 --> 01:25:10,693
So the mosquitoes saved your life.

848
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:15,906
Dad said the same thing,
but Morn was upset.

849
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:17,783
Why?

850
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:22,913
She said, “Why didn't
the mosquitoes bite Reza too?”

851
01:25:24,081 --> 01:25:25,666
I see.

852
01:25:26,792 --> 01:25:28,336
She was right.

853
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:31,589
Dad said it was
the willing of the Lord.

854
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:34,216
- The what?
- The willing of the Lord.

855
01:25:35,259 --> 01:25:37,887
Not “Willing.” Just “Will.”

856
01:25:38,804 --> 01:25:41,974
- We'll get out here.
- Is this Juban?

857
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:45,519
- Stop here and we'll get out.
- All right.

858
01:25:46,395 --> 01:25:48,147
Whatever you say.

859
01:25:58,574 --> 01:26:00,826
Which way to Koker from here?

860
01:26:00,951 --> 01:26:03,162
This way or that way?

861
01:26:03,329 --> 01:26:06,499
Go left and you'll come
to a steep hill.

862
01:26:06,624 --> 01:26:09,335
Give it lots of gas or you'll stall.

863
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:12,463
After a few more curves,
you'll be in Koker.

864
01:26:12,588 --> 01:26:14,965
- Thanks a lot.
- Give me that.

865
01:26:15,424 --> 01:26:17,677
Mister, you forgot this!

866
01:26:28,854 --> 01:26:30,856
Can I get a lift?
