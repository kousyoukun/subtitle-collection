1
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Perfect Number

2
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,152
It stopped raining

3
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,152
It's a bit cold today, Yoon-Ah

4
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,638
What are we going to do with this?

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,352
Oh, no

6
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,513
Hope it's not dead

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,831
"No, it's not.
Leave it, I'll take care of it later"

8
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,751
- See you
- Ok

9
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,552
See you

10
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,755
GOOD MORNING Take-out

11
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,918
Good Morning Lunchbox to go, right?

12
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,069
Yes

13
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,473
It's our new dish
Please try it.

14
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,549
Oh...

15
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,034
thank you Have a good day

16
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,633
Good morning!

17
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,513
One Hand Roll, please

18
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,350
the Good Morning Lunch guy
who comes in every day

19
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,152
I think he likes you

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,672
You noticed it too?

21
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,916
You know how guys are
just so attracted to me

22
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,876
You surely can talk

23
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,758
Why don't you
go on a date with him?

24
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,796
You know I have Yoon-ah

25
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,837
What about her?
She's in middle school

26
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,558
She won't oppose if you get married

27
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,836
I won't see anyone
until Yoon-ah gets married

28
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,156
And I don't really like dorky guys

29
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,479
the nth triangular number is n(n+1)/ 2

30
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,475
the proof of this formula
S is sigma K equals one to n

31
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,631
n- 2, n+1...

32
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,950
Who the hell cares about
those stupid formulas?

33
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,359
Why don't you play it?

34
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,028
Don't just pick chords

35
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,549
What?

36
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,273
If that's a note C

37
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,956
If you play the twelfth fret
What note is it?

38
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,992
It's a C, an octave higher

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,959
If you play a C and G together,
what do you get?

40
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,953
That's a C chord

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,549
that's correct

42
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,030
It's also called the perfect fifth

43
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,232
because it's perfectly consonant

44
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,631
Music is

45
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,556
It all sounds different to our ears

46
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,231
But it's only a matter of how to assemble

47
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,953
chords in consonance

48
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,478
Of course, notes like C, D,
and E already have existed

49
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,270
Like numbers 1, 2, and 3

50
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,758
the person who found out the relationship

51
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,954
between these individual notes
and made formulas called chords

52
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,836
- Is Pythagoras
- Doped-goras

53
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,750
this triangular number
we are studying right now

54
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,235
Pythagoras discovered it

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,353
I'm home

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,479
Auntie...

57
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,749
Yoon-ah!

58
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,589
- What's wrong?
- I feel sick

59
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,353
Sick where? Oh my goodness

60
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,828
Hold on

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,628
Yoon-ah

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,035
Excuse me!

63
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,712
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure

64
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,676
Doctor

65
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,955
What are the symptoms?

66
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,758
Her breath is irregular
Fast and slow

67
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,909
She's having a cardiac arrest

68
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,592
Clear the airway
and prepare CPR

69
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,479
- Yoon-ah!
- Please step aside

70
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,674
Lift your head

71
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,479
You alright?

72
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,559
Ma'am this is medicine...

73
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,675
the man you came with left it for you

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,228
Oh

75
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,556
Good Morning Lunchbox to go, Right?

76
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,553
Yes

77
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,958
It's the hospital bill you paid last night

78
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,673
Please take it

79
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,955
Yes

80
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,633
this lunchbox is the interest

81
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,029
Yoon-ah likes math unlike other girls

82
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,438
You're a math teacher, Right?

83
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,035
Yes

84
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,675
What was that?

85
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,148
Nothing

86
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,876
- there's something
- You told me to date him

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,638
thought you said you don't like dorky guys

88
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,152
Something must've happened

89
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,350
Is he free-diving?

90
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,388
Beginners should never try it

91
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,674
Yes

92
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,749
Fucking asshole

93
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,875
Son of a bitch

94
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,950
You laughing? Die, bitch!

95
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,233
Die asshole! I'm going to kill you

96
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,470
Asshole! Don't laugh!

97
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,158
Is that you, Yoon-ah?
Where's your key?

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,752
Thought I couldn't find you?

99
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,553
Fucking bitch

100
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,353
You bitch

101
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,950
thought you could run away?

102
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,554
You sleep well?

103
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,996
Thought you can live without me?

104
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,350
No fucking beer?

105
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,159
Get up and sit down, you bitch

106
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,270
Girl, I went all overtown

107
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,432
every bar and club in Daejeon

108
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,830
Leave us alone please

109
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,638
Leave you alone? Fuck me.

110
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,952
Auntie, your daughter's home

111
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,549
Hi, Yoon-ah

112
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,358
You've grown up beautifully

113
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,313
Your daughter'?
That's some fucked up family tree

114
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,311
Come in. Go inside

115
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,435
Come say hello to your uncle

116
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,749
You little bitch!

117
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,478
Don't yell at her

118
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,868
tomorrow, I’LL wire you every penny I have

119
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,154
Yoon-ah

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,355
Let me see your face

121
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,991
- Wow, very scary
- What are you doing?

122
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,830
Go away

123
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,193
Look at her boobs

124
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,430
Just leave!
Damn, leave her alone!

125
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,072
What? Let's have fun

126
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,116
this is nice and fresh

127
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,678
I'm going to kill you

128
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,955
Oh yeah? Let's die. Let's do that

129
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,754
Alright, fucking kill me

130
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,274
Stay still

131
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,958
Fuck yeah

132
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,553
You fucking bitch

133
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,399
Fucking slut

134
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,433
Fucking bitch

135
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,079
Yoon-ah

136
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,798
Fucking bitch! Move

137
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,358
Come here bitch!

138
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,833
"- Stop!
- Come here, fucking bitch"

139
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,629
Let go of me

140
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,437
- Auntie!
- Where you going, bitch?

141
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,712
Stop!
Don't hurt her

142
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,438
Fuck

143
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,159
Is this funny?

144
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,275
Oh my god

145
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,069
Auntie

146
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,633
He must be dead

147
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,834
Who is it?

148
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,876
It's next door

149
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,750
Hold on, please

150
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,959
Don't come out

151
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,439
Yes?

152
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,029
Umm...

153
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,152
Are you alright?

154
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,229
What?

155
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,958
Yes. I'm fine

156
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,478
I heard some noise

157
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,353
A roach

158
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,438
there was a roach

159
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,999
Did you kill it?

160
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,228
What?

161
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,150
The roach

162
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,636
Oh, yes

163
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,154
I killed it

164
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,274
I see

165
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,349
Auntie

166
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,549
Are you going to call the police?

167
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,952
The police?

168
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,954
No

169
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,953
I will turn myself in

170
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,359
I have to turn myself in too, don't I?

171
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,953
What are you talking about it?

172
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,148
Why?

173
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,952
I hit him first

174
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,476
And I held him so he wouldn't move

175
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,872
Don't even think about it

176
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,873
No way

177
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,238
You were in your room

178
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,831
You didn't see anything Got it?

179
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,149
I think I can be of help

180
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,232
It won't be too late to call the police
after you hear me first

181
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,874
Who is he?

182
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,194
It's my ex-husband

183
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,077
He tortured my aunt everyday

184
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,436
- He threatened her
- Yoon-ah

185
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,556
Are you going to turn yourself in?

186
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,629
Yes

187
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,949
No, auntie

188
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,791
If you go to jail, I'm
going to be all alone

189
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,358
No, auntie

190
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,554
Yoon-ah

191
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,077
You two did it together

192
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,799
No. I did it alone

193
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,552
She didn't see anything

194
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,751
She came after I killed him, seriously

195
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,278
the bite mark

196
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,309
Whose is that?

197
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,992
I did it all

198
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,356
It's impossible for you to strangle him
and hold his hands at the same time

199
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,551
Will the police find out?

200
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,879
They will know better than me

201
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,757
No, not my Yoon-ah
Oh, no

202
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,869
If you turn yourself in
there are extenuating circumstances

203
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,470
But you might have to do some time

204
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,955
Yoon-ah might not get off clean either

205
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,552
You might not be able
to think clearly now

206
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,630
but if you let me help you

207
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,555
I’LL protect you two no matter what

208
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,153
Was he supposed to come?

209
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,356
Did you plan to meet him here?

210
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,752
No, he came unexpectedly

211
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,039
Did he call you?

212
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,635
He doesn't know my number

213
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,553
I'm sorry

214
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,349
By any chance,

215
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,758
do you go see movies often?

216
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,395
Mang-won district near Han river
Dead body found, calling for back-up

217
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,549
Hey guys

218
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,353
that head is like a rotten watermelon

219
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,552
Do you think you’ll get something?

220
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,033
Look here

221
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,756
the fingerprints are destroyed

222
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,589
It might take up to 2-3 weeks
to identify the body

223
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,113
- 2-3 weeks?
- Yes

224
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,036
What kind of lunatic did this?

225
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,074
The asshole grinded the body
to hide the victim's identity

226
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,270
the killer is an acquaintance
Perhaps, the closest person to the victim

227
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,870
So what?

228
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,033
We can't even ID the victim
What good does that do?

229
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,833
What now?

230
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,638
Are you going to fool around
until forensics come out?

231
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,350
The face is smashed so badly
I don't think we can match a dental record

232
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,832
I don't know if you can ID the body

233
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,192
You're really good at
making people feel worse

234
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,754
that's a real talent

235
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,352
Don't step around there

236
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,473
this is going to suck

237
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,554
the only thing we have
is the body with two balls

238
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,639
the disposal of the body
seems too timid to be a psychopath's job

239
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,435
the tires are all flat
Is it abandoned?

240
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,353
Lift that

241
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,719
Is that a key?

242
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,755
JINSUNG Inn

243
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,557
Guess the bastard was in a real hurry
to make a mistake like that

244
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,839
He didn't pay and left his stuff

245
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,230
I was going to call the police

246
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,234
Have you seen any visitors?

247
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,629
No idea

248
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,355
there are so many who come and go

249
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,032
the victim is 36 year old
male living in Daejeon

250
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,519
the name is Kim Cheol-min

251
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,079
It's fortunate you found it

252
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,548
the victim was staying in a motel
just before the murder, since November 7th

253
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,789
Luckily, we found the
motel key at the scene

254
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,951
the DNA from the hair in the motel
matched the body's DNA

255
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,833
Cause of death?

256
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,360
According to the autopsy,
he was killed by strangulation

257
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,398
We found a consistent
pattern of an electric wire

258
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:51,195
used in heating devices
on the victim's neck

259
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,988
We analyzed it as the electric wire
often used in irons

260
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,115
Irons?

261
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,592
Estimated time of death?

262
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,149
We estimated it as November 9th
in between 4 P.M. and 1 1 P.M.

263
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,994
So the victim was walking alive
before 4 P.M. on the 9th

264
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,838
- Correct?
- Yes

265
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,356
"to be exact, he was alive till 736"

266
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,231
Based on what?

267
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,514
We found an abandoned
self-service rental bicycle on the scene

268
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,238
Self-service bicycles?

269
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,108
You can easily rent the public bicycles by
entering your resident registration number

270
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,033
It was rented from a kiosk
in Sang-am district

271
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,150
It was rented with
Kim Cheol-min's resident number

272
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,069
Really?

273
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,791
So you have a suspect?

274
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,917
Considering the travel path and radius,

275
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,599
Kim Cheol-min's ex-wife,
Baek Hwa-sun is our prime suspect

276
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,555
the reason is?

277
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,157
Now, we need to find out

278
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,075
thank you

279
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,279
Kim Cheol-min was found dead

280
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,036
He was brutally murdered

281
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,636
We had some trouble locating you
because your address was changed

282
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,955
According to the registration files,
he doesn't have any relatives

283
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,440
Do you know of any distant relatives?

284
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,352
I don't think he has any

285
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,915
I see

286
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,799
When did you meet him last?

287
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,110
I haven't seen him since I moved to Seoul

288
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,271
You haven't talked to him
during the recent months?

289
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,158
No

290
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,952
If you don't mind
what did you do on the 9th?

291
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,430
Pardon?

292
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,839
November 9th

293
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,319
I worked

294
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,514
And after you got off?

295
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,078
I took my niece to a movie

296
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,957
Guess it was a nice outing for a change

297
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,079
What's wrong with your hands?

298
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,596
What?

299
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,874
Your hands...

300
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,278
I got hurt at work

301
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,874
When?

302
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,679
A few days ago

303
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,669
Hello

304
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,276
It's me from next door

305
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,556
The detectives were here this afternoon

306
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,952
I did as you told me

307
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,953
Ok. they're coming for Yoon-ah soon

308
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,828
Okay

309
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,670
What did you do to it?

310
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,754
How did they find out so quickly?
Did they find the body?

311
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,557
Just answer like a machine
only to the questions asked

312
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,036
They might be watching you from near

313
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,148
So even if we bump into each other,
act like usual neighbors

314
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,231
I’LL warn Yoon-ah also

315
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,756
Did you tell them about the movie tickets?

316
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,629
No

317
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,678
You told me not to show them
until I was asked

318
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,195
Where did you put the tickets?

319
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,235
In my wallet

320
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,469
No, no

321
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,879
the movie flyer,
fold it in half and put the tickets inside

322
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,354
Not many people keep movie tickets

323
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,150
They might get suspicious
if you take them out from your wallet

324
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,554
Okay

325
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,799
I will

326
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,631
I’LL always call you around this time

327
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,229
I was wondering...

328
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,674
Yes?

329
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,351
If we really should do this

330
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,872
You have to trust me

331
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,149
Alright

332
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,269
the only family she has is her niece

333
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,750
She wanted to live out her sister's dreams

334
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,950
She was going to raise
Yoon-ah for her sister

335
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:06,472
It is so sweet of her
I admire her

336
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,876
So she left town

337
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,431
Did Kim Cheol-min come here recently?

338
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,036
About a week ago

339
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,756
He went crazy here
trying to get Hwa-sun's whereabouts

340
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,278
So did you tell him where she was?

341
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,111
Are you insane?

342
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,751
What did he do this time?
Is he in trouble again?

343
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,148
He was murdered

344
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,072
Whoever did it, I am grateful

345
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,232
Hwa-sun will finally get some
sleep at night A real good sleep

346
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,956
thank you

347
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,352
You said you saw a movie
with your niece on November 9th

348
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,471
Do you have the tickets by any chance?

349
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,874
Pardon?

350
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,474
The movie tickets

351
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,429
No, I don't

352
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,949
Oh

353
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,429
I have this though

354
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,270
Movie tickets

355
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,479
For November 9th

356
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,950
You saw this movie?

357
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,558
Detective Jo, what's with you?

358
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,829
Why are you keep insisting
Baek Hwa-sun is the killer?

359
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,038
She has a clear motive for murder

360
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,273
And her hands
It's due to strained ligaments

361
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,358
You saw the scar on victim's neck

362
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,672
When you choke someone to death

363
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,674
with a thin wire, you will get a sprain

364
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,151
that's a coincidence

365
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,037
there's no such thing
as a coincidence to a detective

366
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,029
Isn't it too perfect to find tickets
in between a flyer from the recycling bin?

367
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,033
What's wrong with perfect?

368
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,671
When are you going to
become a real detective?

369
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,474
From now on,
it's about who cracks down first

370
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,749
Put out the cigarette

371
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,833
Let me warm up with it

372
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,955
No

373
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,153
It's cold

374
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,349
turn off the engine, idiot

375
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,353
What's wrong with you, stupid?

376
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,553
Baek Hwa-sun

377
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,750
I think the cops are watching right now

378
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,474
Here

379
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,870
Isn't that the guy who went in first?

380
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,149
I think so

381
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,154
Pizza

382
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,674
Movies

383
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,557
It's all here

384
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,398
How did you end up
watching a movie with your aunt?

385
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,358
You're in middle school
Don't you have a lot of friends?

386
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,358
Guess you're very close to your aunt

387
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,673
She listens well too, right?
She’ll do whatever her aunt tells

388
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,839
Anybody can use a credit card

389
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,555
I didn't use her card
She never gave it to me

390
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,115
Really?

391
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,677
So your aunt used it?

392
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,749
Yes

393
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,553
thanks for the drink

394
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,315
What is wrong?

395
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,548
Wait

396
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,074
What are you doing?

397
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,153
Excuse me...

398
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,756
You...?

399
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,836
Cheers

400
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,113
I can't believe I ran into you here
this is so weird

401
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,519
It's good to see you

402
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,353
Hey, do you remember...

403
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,359
the woman living next door to you

404
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,558
that case I told you earlier

405
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,997
She's the prime suspect

406
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,959
She has an alibi but
an alibi is there to be broken

407
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,749
It could be

408
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,148
Okay

409
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,749
Get in

410
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,077
Alright. See you later

411
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,115
Okay

412
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,029
Oh!

413
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,438
Doped out Pythagoras!

414
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,549
Right?

415
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,028
Right, right

416
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,430
It's been a while Doped-goras

417
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,952
It was good to see you

418
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,628
What happened?

419
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,439
What did you tell the detectives?

420
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,558
They're probably still here

421
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,271
Here. Act natural
as if taking something from me

422
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,676
Get inside

423
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,639
She was looking out the window
the whole time

424
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,833
As if she was waiting

425
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,353
Of course

426
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,429
the guy next door was talking to a cop
who thinks you're a suspect

427
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,230
Must be really nervous

428
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,471
I ran the credit card

429
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,148
"She bought the tickets exactly at 7:52"

430
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,356
So you believe Baek saw the movie

431
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,954
And on Kim Cheol-min's phone record

432
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,551
He ordered some Chinese on the 9th
and nothing else

433
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,877
He has never talked to Baek

434
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,150
Ok. think of it this way

435
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,154
the niece could've swiped the card

436
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,429
and says she didn't

437
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,673
Even if Baek went there herself,
there is plenty of time

438
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,353
But there's no proof that
she didn't see the movie

439
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,871
Don't you dare look at me like that

440
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,594
So this is all about that...
Goldbach's conjecture

441
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,748
Go where?

442
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,355
Goldbach, stupid

443
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,596
Like right now,
there is suspicion but no evidence

444
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,234
It will drive you nuts

445
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,950
Did you get anything from
your school friend?

446
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,228
Seok-go

447
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,439
Nothing interests him except for math

448
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,949
Math?

449
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,150
Have you ever seen a genius?

450
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,350
It's not divisible, it's a prime number

451
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,154
Yo, Kim Seok-go

452
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,754
Doped-goras

453
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,878
So you're a genius?

454
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,951
What are you going to
do with your genius brain?

455
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,349
Prove

456
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,669
Prove? Prove what?

457
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,439
Have you ever heard
of Goldbach's conjecture?

458
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,438
No way

459
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,552
So go on

460
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,756
Every even integer greater than 2
is the sum of two primes

461
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,757
true or false?

462
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,357
Nobody has solved it in 300 years

463
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,079
What do you think?

464
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,555
True

465
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,510
then it's done
Do you must prove it?

466
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,671
If I don't prove it, I won't know the truth

467
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,558
I want to know the truth

468
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,313
the truth

469
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,952
You want to find the truth

470
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,231
By the way,
making a problem no one can solve

471
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,232
or solving that problem

472
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,470
Which is harder?

473
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,552
You prove that
How would I know?

474
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,355
Here. Lilac is the taste of love, true?

475
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,951
Prove that, say ""ahh"""

476
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,032
Good

477
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,236
If you want to prove it, chew it well

478
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,155
that is love, dude Bitter, huh?

479
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,638
We went to high school together

480
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,394
It's an unexpected variable
but it's going as calculated

481
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,358
Don't worry

482
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,549
But you need to be more careful
about such actions

483
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,240
I’LL trust you completely from now on

484
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,829
Did the cops question Yoon-ah?

485
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,358
Yes. She said they were waiting
outside the school

486
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,838
Can you get Yoon-ah on the phone?

487
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,879
Hold on

488
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,074
Hello

489
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,472
What did the cops ask you?

490
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,153
They showed me a picture
and asked if I've met him recently

491
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,919
I told them I haven't

492
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,230
they asked again about going to the movies

493
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,952
What did you tell them?

494
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,831
I said I saw the movie on the 9th for sure

495
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,156
And I told them about my friend
I ran into at the movies

496
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,958
Good. that's good, Yoon-ah

497
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,479
And one more thing

498
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,277
If they come again, don't be scared
Just do as you're doing now

499
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,279
Okay, Yoon-ah?

500
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,674
I will

501
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,640
things are really happening as he said

502
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,679
Surveillance tapes from the theaters

503
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,632
Oh my head
the moment finally has come

504
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,756
Don't be intimidated

505
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,070
Just watch the elevator camera

506
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,228
Detective Jo

507
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,553
Detective Jo!

508
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,429
Baek Hwa-sun

509
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,958
Did they come?

510
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,239
The two came
they did come to the theaters

511
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,556
So the friend story is true

512
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,869
then...

513
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,560
I just need to find Baek leaving alone

514
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,356
they indeed saw the movie

515
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,349
Guys

516
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,028
What's wrong with you?

517
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,239
What are you doing?

518
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,840
Shouldn't you be asking around
Kim Cheol-min's acquaintances?

519
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,594
Money problems, women problems
Middle, high school friends

520
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,636
People from military service Co-workers

521
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,229
You

522
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,749
Don't go looking for motives
Go find people with motives

523
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,068
Got that?

524
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,872
Got that? Answer me!

525
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,879
Yes, sir!

526
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,396
Captain

527
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,755
What, now what!

528
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,236
They want me to take
the lie detector test tomorrow

529
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,836
I don't think I can do it anymore

530
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,950
I should've turned myself in that day

531
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,271
I think it will be better
to turn myself in right now

532
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,357
What would happen to Yoon-ah then?

533
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,354
No. Just do as you've been doing

534
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,672
You don't have to lie

535
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,351
Don't worry about that

536
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,955
I don't know what's going on

537
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,231
Why is everybody asking about the 9th?

538
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,238
You don't need to know

539
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,836
the cops will soon find another suspect

540
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,033
You said you trusted me

541
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,077
that I’LL protect you no matter what

542
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,675
I do I trust you

543
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,039
tomorrow will be the last crisis

544
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,960
Please lift the sleeve on your left arm

545
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,314
I have a lot of appointments today
So let's do this quickly

546
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,953
Don't be nervous

547
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,233
From now on, answer ""no""" to my questions

548
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,833
Are you a man?

549
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,428
No

550
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,075
Is your name Baek Hwa-sun?

551
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,069
No

552
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,756
Good. We will start now

553
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,678
Has Kim Cheol-min ever come
to your workplace?

554
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,357
Have you ever met Kim Cheol-min
at your workplace?

555
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,439
No. I have not

556
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,434
You said you saw a movie on November 9th
Is this true?

557
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,828
Yes

558
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,555
Did you watch the movie
from the beginning to end?

559
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,669
Yes

560
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,677
Did you meet your ex-husband,
Kim Cheol-min on November 9th?

561
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,794
Meet him?

562
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,429
Yes. On November 9th,
did you meet Kim Cheol-min?

563
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,478
No. I did not

564
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,478
You didn't see him?
Not even once that day?

565
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,069
No

566
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,638
there's no need to continue
with the next question

567
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,553
thanks for your time

568
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,757
- Is it over?
- Yes

569
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,039
Wait, you skipped an important question!

570
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,749
Ms. Baek Hwa-sun

571
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,350
Did you kill Kim Cheol-min?

572
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,914
Did you kill him?

573
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,149
Who the hell are you?

574
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,673
No. I didn't kill him

575
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,835
It's a lie

576
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,909
What are you doing?

577
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,239
It says it's a lie

578
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,151
You're not an examiner
I won't accept this

579
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,390
Wait, don't turn it off!

580
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,152
Ask her one more time

581
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,755
Baek Hwa-sun, Did you kill Kim Cheol-min?

582
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,156
We won't be seeing you anymore
Get home safely

583
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,630
Hey, Sang-joon

584
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,479
Come on.

585
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,551
Man...

586
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,556
It went well as you said

587
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,757
Okay, you did good

588
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,428
Let's eat

589
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,556
Why doesn't he call?
It would be nice if he joined us

590
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,558
I didn't think about that

591
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,069
Yoon-ah

592
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,589
I'm sorry

593
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,113
Why?

594
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,874
I'm really super grateful to you
Every single day

595
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,638
Yoon-ah, promise me

596
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,753
You have to forget everything

597
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,233
You have to go on

598
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,153
Alright. Don't worry

599
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,759
Can I eat now?

600
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,629
Yes

601
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,154
Hey

602
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,150
You saved them, right?

603
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,155
What?

604
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,558
My flowers

605
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,835
I know everything

606
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,908
Hey

607
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,759
You like my aunt
that's why you helped us, right?

608
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,357
I wanted to thank you
And my aunt waited for your call

609
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,555
Yoon-ah

610
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,353
Here's your order
I’LL help you with the bill

611
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,710
thank you

612
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,233
Bon appetit

613
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,758
What can I get you?

614
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,276
Sunshine Morning Lunchbox, please

615
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,759
Sunshine Morning?

616
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,752
Thank you, Bon appetit

617
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,956
Good Morning Lunchbox to go?

618
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,389
Yes

619
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,153
You will have to eat something else today

620
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,156
I heard it's going to get
colder starting tomorrow

621
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,514
Clear Morning Lunchbox, please

622
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,669
Yes

623
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,638
I'll never forget your care, I Thank you

624
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,274
Mr. Kim, I’LL see you later

625
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,954
I see...Okay

626
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,958
I understand

627
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,353
Dude. Who killed you?

628
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,629
Dude!

629
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,792
Stop, stop, stop!
She passed the polygraph

630
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,950
And the polygraph said she killed him

631
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,954
the examiner said anyone would do the same
if you ask with that look

632
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,473
Look here, compare them to the other people

633
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,553
Do they look like they're enjoying
an outing to the movies?

634
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,632
I know you don't want to accept

635
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,828
Are we going on a stakeout?

636
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,279
Welcome

637
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,548
Hey, Hwa-sun

638
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,552
I went to Daejeon the other day
and heard the news from Madam Jung

639
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,230
Did the cops come see you?

640
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,148
They came a few times

641
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,559
I was worried that

642
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,472
you might be harassed
for no good reason

643
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,469
I'm alright

644
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,278
If there's anything I can help

645
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,471
No. It's ok
You've been helpful every time. thank you

646
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,756
It's raining

647
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,511
I'm alright

648
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,671
No. You might catch a cold

649
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,471
Woo-hoo!
Who are you and where have you been?

650
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,955
Take care. I’LL call you later

651
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,278
No. I don't think...

652
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:16,355
I regretted letting you go like that

653
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,749
I won't do that anymore

654
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,469
Get in

655
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,953
Auntie, it's him calling

656
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,428
Hello

657
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,150
Was everything okay today?

658
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,154
Yes

659
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,478
Who was the man you came with?

660
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,477
I know him from
where I used to work in Daejeon

661
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,869
I see

662
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:54,156
He loaned me some money before

663
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,559
He came to see me and
I couldn't just make him leave

664
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,838
So we had tea

665
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,751
You don't have anything else to say?

666
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,351
Then I’LL call you tomorrow

667
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,233
What's wrong?

668
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,555
It's nothing

669
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,556
Hey, drenched Doped-goras!

670
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,428
Where have you been?

671
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,475
Look at all these books here

672
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,955
Look at these, you're hopeless

673
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,279
this math formula... It's sickening

674
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,154
You truly are doped out Pythagoras

675
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,229
Did you find the killer?

676
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,156
No. I'm totally screwed

677
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,190
Why?

678
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,749
Your next door neighbor
She really screwed me up

679
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,758
I must be getting old

680
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,356
I was pretty good back in the days
but now I'm a big mess

681
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,478
I'm looking for another suspect,
but don't know where to look

682
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,550
Where is that fucker?

683
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,473
A mustache

684
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,354
Look at all these old notes

685
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,555
What is this?

686
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,479
Nothing. I was bored

687
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:24,955
Hey, this is Goldbach's conjecture

688
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,758
Are you still working on this?

689
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,915
Are you not going to drink?

690
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,433
I sure am

691
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,639
Are you getting some progress
with this conjecture?

692
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,837
Right. that's why no one has proved it
in several hundred years

693
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,794
this is difficult, conjecture...

694
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,835
You're right

695
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,954
My brain is getting dull,
It's getting difficult

696
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,276
If I fail to prove it,
I’LL ask when I get up there

697
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,669
What?

698
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,031
Up there, He will know the truth

699
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,955
Whether Goldbach's conjecture
is true or false

700
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,840
In the most beautiful and simplest proof

701
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,231
You, a philosopher Drink up

702
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,479
Hey, Seok-go
Are you seeing anyone?

703
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,555
You?

704
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,156
I've been married for 3 years

705
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,113
Also, it's been a year since I got divorced

706
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,878
Ugh, I really truly don't get it

707
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,237
You know what my wife
said when she left me?

708
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,632
She left a famous line

709
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,350
Do you know what love is? She asked me that

710
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,952
She implied that I never truly loved her

711
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,110
But shit. think about it
What is true?

712
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,154
What is real?
What the fuck is real love? Shit

713
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,873
You said love is bitter

714
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,669
What?

715
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,636
You said Love is bitter

716
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,558
When did I say that?

717
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,549
Li...Lilac! Right?

718
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,556
You remembered that?
You're a mathematician

719
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,475
Doped-goras is smart

720
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,949
I am so jealous of you, Kim Seok-go

721
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,479
You are awesome doing all this math

722
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,352
this is what's real, Mathematics

723
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,551
What the heck is the Perfect Number?

724
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,557
I'll never forget your care, Thank you

725
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,029
Are you up?

726
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,869
Yeah Hey, last night...

727
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,956
Why did I drink so much last night?

728
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,758
I didn't do anything weird, did I?

729
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,468
I feel really shitty

730
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,431
Good luck on your test
Are you coming straight home after school?

731
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,194
- Yeah, see you later
- See you

732
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,199
GOOD MORNING Take-out

733
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,633
You still go to this place?

734
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,752
Didn't I tell you?

735
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,672
I always buy my lunch there

736
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,954
Don't you feel awkward?
Eating lunch prepared by a murder suspect?

737
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,953
Though you wouldn't care about
something like that

738
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,228
I'm going to wash up

739
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,199
I think I'm sobering up
It's getting cold.

740
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,070
Go under? Okay under

741
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:02,238
Aren't they cold? It's not summer anymore

742
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,553
these people here are
always the same like clockwork

743
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:16,469
So I've heard
they are precise like a clock

744
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,149
We're always fast or slow
living life in a hurry

745
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,873
If we free ourselves from clocks,
will we be more punctual?

746
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,072
Who is he staring at?

747
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,354
Bye

748
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,274
Hey

749
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,273
Aren't you going to pick up lunch?
You have to eat

750
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,469
Hello

751
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,554
No, no, no. I'm not a cop today
I came as a customer

752
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,429
Okay

753
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,030
Let's see. What should I get?

754
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,433
What are you getting?

755
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,068
He always orders Good Morning Lunchbox

756
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,517
Okay then, two Good Morning
Lunchboxes, please

757
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,555
Okay

758
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,075
Hey.

759
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,593
Did you find out? Hold on

760
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,636
Sorry but do you have a piece of paper?

761
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,559
Okay. So what?

762
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,675
Hold on

763
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,148
Sorry. the pen isn't working

764
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,948
Choi Chan-min?

765
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,232
010-3413...

766
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,597
728...7287

767
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,637
87 Correct? 87?
Okay, be right over

768
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,949
thank you

769
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,549
Welcome

770
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,033
Hello Mr. Nam, you came again

771
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,473
Here you go

772
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,552
How much is it?

773
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,471
- It's 12 dollars
- 12 dollars?

774
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,433
I stopped by on my way to work

775
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,638
I wanted to try the lunchbox you make

776
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,157
You're busy from early in the morning

777
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,439
What should I get?

778
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,949
Aren't you leaving?

779
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,753
Oh yeah. I am

780
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,479
Do you go ice climbing?

781
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,633
I heard that is great

782
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,356
Heard the snaps on this thing is terrific

783
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,556
I don't do ice climbing
but the customers have complimented on it

784
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,758
Excuse me, please look around

785
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,348
I...

786
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,476
I don't think we should see
each other anymore

787
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,236
I came here to tell you that

788
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,630
I'm not saying we need
to do anything right now

789
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,068
We have our own situations,
so let's take it slow

790
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,954
Did you forget everything
I've done for you?

791
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,429
Watch me

792
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,754
Watch what I will do

793
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,433
You're late

794
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:23,029
It's okay. No one's watching us

795
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,439
You were charged more
this month for the water

796
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,474
What?

797
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,276
I hear some leaking sound at night
I was wondering if you knew

798
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,829
You want me to fix it?

799
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,033
No, it's fine

800
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,149
Alright then

801
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,153
See you later

802
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,148
By the way

803
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,432
Your clothes seem gaudy today
And your make-up is heavy

804
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,399
Detective Jo!

805
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,149
What are you doing out in the cold?

806
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,754
- I brought some hot...
- Left the bicycle

807
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,390
Left the bicycle with flat tires here

808
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,992
Bicycles?

809
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,037
Meticulously destroyed
the victim's face and fingerprints

810
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,550
but left the victim's things on the scene

811
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,630
You're saying the killer
left the bicycle on purpose?

812
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,719
What if he did?

813
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,075
And tell us the time of the murder?

814
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,559
Why would he do that?

815
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,790
To prove Baek's alibi

816
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,994
What?

817
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,956
In order to prove Baek was in the theaters

818
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,478
when Kim Cheol-min arrived here

819
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,838
that's why the tires are flat

820
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,038
So no one can ride it

821
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,638
then the window of time
for murder is spread

822
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:31,475
out and Baek's alibi
becomes insufficient

823
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,436
You still think Baek killed him?

824
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,028
What if

825
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,676
"Baek was at home in between 6 and 630"

826
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,752
And Kim Cheol-min was killed there

827
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,475
No way

828
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,673
How can she move the body
from her house to here in 30 minutes?

829
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,275
She even has no car
Did she grab a taxi?

830
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,678
Also, she had to rent the bicycle
She can't do all that by herself

831
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,190
It's impossible, right?

832
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,035
No way
Especially, a woman by herself can't

833
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:13,039
the victim's clothes we found here
What was the size?

834
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,438
What about it?

835
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,355
That's not important.
I found another suspect

836
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,548
What?

837
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,957
Did Ms. Baek ask you to kill Kim Cheol-min?

838
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,635
Hwa-sun could never kill someone
or hire a hit man

839
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,633
And do you think I'm stupid?

840
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,833
Even if I like the girl you
think I'd kill someone?

841
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,436
Then you killed Kim Cheol-min
without her knowing?

842
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,639
Because in order to be with her,
Kim Cheol-min had to disappear

843
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,069
What?

844
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,071
What did you do on November 9th?

845
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,752
Look here guys

846
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,075
When will you stop bothering Hwa-sun?

847
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,994
Well...

848
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,317
Until we have no reason to

849
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,560
November 9th

850
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,759
He's not our guy

851
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,353
Geez man

852
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,599
He has a clear motive A motive!

853
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,828
So the motive

854
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,155
the reason

855
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,549
What?

856
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,556
There is someone but...

857
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,072
Yeah? Who?

858
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,472
But there is no motive

859
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,876
Write question #1 on the board
and if you have the time, do it up to #4

860
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,949
Hey

861
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,468
So you are the disciple of Doped-Goras

862
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,829
Excuse me?

863
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,676
Back in school, your teacher's nickname was
Doped out Pythagoras

864
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,553
Aren't his problems difficult?

865
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,473
Everybody says it's hard but I like it

866
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,756
Oh yeah? Why?

867
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,234
Well..

868
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,158
His problems have blind spots
that mislead people

869
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,876
It might seem like a geometry problem
But it's actually a function

870
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,677
You're killing them all

871
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,749
Go on

872
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,235
Yes, sir

873
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,959
Study hard

874
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,628
Let's go to the break room

875
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,149
Okay

876
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,437
What's up? Obviously, you're not here
to check out my tests

877
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,630
Don't take this personally

878
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,437
According to this, you skipped
the morning class on November 10th

879
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,236
And you came to work in the afternoon
What happened to you?

880
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,229
A cold

881
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,474
Really?

882
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,873
What do you mean?

883
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,076
And you were absent on the 9th

884
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,235
I heard that you sometimes skip morning
classes to do your math research

885
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,478
But the administrator was surprised
that you were absent on the 9th and 10th

886
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,357
Said you never took off
for two days in a row

887
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,949
I haven't?

888
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,148
Is that weird?

889
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,033
A scrupulous person like you

890
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,233
It's odd you didn't come to work
for a mere cold

891
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,559
On top of that,
you were absent the day before

892
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,469
Did you go see a doctor?

893
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,356
What do you want from me?

894
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,152
I suddenly want to ask you this

895
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,355
Making a problem no one can solve

896
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,358
or solving that problem

897
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,038
Which is harder?

898
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,558
Did you pity Baek Hwa-sun?

899
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,752
She killed a person

900
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,479
I have to go

901
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,948
See you later

902
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,349
Auntie

903
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,028
the next door, He is here

904
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,993
What're you doing at my place?

905
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,149
You're home

906
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,549
I'm almost done

907
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,635
Isn't Kim Cheol-min about tft 6in?

908
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,552
Don't they seem too big?

909
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,358
These fit you

910
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,829
Don't they seem too big for tft 6in guy?

911
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,148
Guess so
But you can wear pants however you want

912
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,559
I felt uneasy so I thought well and hard

913
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,071
But this has to be an unmotivated murder

914
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,872
that's why there's no suspect

915
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,869
You think a psychopath did it?

916
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,316
Usually, when a murder happens
the killer will do anything to hide the body

917
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,353
Bury in the mountains or
sink it in a reservoir

918
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,155
Even if he didn't have a car

919
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,750
Han-river was right in front of you

920
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,795
If I were him, I’LL tie the body with
something heavy and sink it under water

921
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,153
So you're saying

922
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,476
the killer left the body
on purpose for others to find

923
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,553
Yeah, he's a psychopath
He wants the world to know what he did

924
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,956
At least that's my guess

925
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,152
then think about it this way

926
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:10,157
the killer wanted the body to be found

927
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,955
that's right

928
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,749
then this actually makes sense

929
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,475
Nov. 9th Absent
Nov. 10th Absent

930
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,040
His problems have blind spots
that mislead people

931
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,237
It might seem like a geometry problem
But it's actually a function

932
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,869
Right?

933
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,555
JINSUNG Inn

934
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,757
there was an empty noodle bowl
and he was gone

935
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,555
So you didn't see him
the day before his murder either?

936
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,158
Chinese food...

937
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,270
think it was around midnight
He asked about food delivery

938
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,157
I gave him the number
for a chicken delivery

939
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,429
Over the phone?

940
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,237
So you've never really seen
the guy's face. Have you?

941
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,629
Mister

942
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,589
Mister

943
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,477
No, no wait!

944
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,674
Mister!

945
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,635
Wait

946
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,995
Mister!

947
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,636
Hey!

948
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,189
You going up?

949
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,078
Stop right there! Hey!

950
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,348
Until now

951
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,950
I only focused on Baek's alibi

952
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,155
But the alibi wasn't important in this case

953
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,354
the problem was the dead body

954
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,629
Really?

955
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,838
But I...

956
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,635
I hope I'm wrong

957
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,751
Looking at the homeless,
you said they are precise like clockwork

958
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,634
And you said when one gets free from
clocks, one will become even more precise

959
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:57,155
that's for people who are aware of time!

960
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,469
For people living within the clock!

961
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,755
I have no idea what you're talking about

962
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,754
Did you kill someone?

963
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:18,634
Even if you solve this problem,
it won't make anyone happy

964
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,469
Nor change anything

965
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,271
You...

966
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,632
You think it's going to change anything?

967
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,229
Yoon-ah must be really gifted at math

968
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,871
What brings you here?

969
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,674
It's just that...

970
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,750
I received these at the store today

971
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,238
Stay away from Baek Hwa-sun

972
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,239
You bastard can never make her happy

973
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,236
Is there anyone you know who might do this?

974
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,469
Should I call the police?

975
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,754
No, no police

976
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,077
You said you trusted me

977
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,556
that I’LL protect you no matter what

978
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,953
Please let me in

979
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,557
I have to ask you something

980
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,593
Seok-go

981
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,350
You like me, don't you?

982
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,555
That's why you're helping me Isn't it?

983
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:42,153
The past few days, you
feel like a stranger to me

984
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,836
You sent those pictures, didn't you?

985
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:58,835
What?

986
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,433
You don't want me?

987
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,877
Isn't this what you want?

988
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,755
I should've known

989
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,877
there's nothing free in this world

990
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,037
All men are the same
It's so obvious

991
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,029
Do whatever you want, do it

992
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,752
Who cares if you're a pervert

993
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,552
I brought this unto myself

994
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,068
Why?

995
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,877
Why are you doing this to me?

996
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,878
I barely escaped from a lunatic

997
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,949
How can I live feeling so suffocated?

998
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,913
What is it you want from me?

999
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,079
Go home

1000
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,748
Yoon-ah's waiting

1001
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,638
Do you love Baek Hwa-sun?

1002
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,275
Who? Who are you?

1003
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,759
How much do you love her?

1004
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,837
Can you die for her? Huh?

1005
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,158
What the...

1006
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,590
Who the hell are you?

1007
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,714
What the fuck? Asshole

1008
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,356
Who the hell are you?
Come here fucking

1009
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,397
- Asshole!
- You want to die?

1010
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,072
Who the hell are you?

1011
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,630
You're that fucker
You sent those pictures, didn't you?

1012
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:17,029
You messed with the wrong person
You crazy asshole

1013
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,108
Did you find it?

1014
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,431
He could be a real criminal
Look closely

1015
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,668
Not over there, look up!
If you don't break up with him
I'm going to kill him myself

1016
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,672
I got it

1017
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,151
I saw him for the first
time on November 9th

1018
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,551
Kim Cheol-min...
that filthy piece of trash

1019
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,236
He was lurking in front of the apartment

1020
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,236
As soon as I saw him,
I knew he was Hwa-sun's ex-husband

1021
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,832
How did you know right away?

1022
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,350
I know everything about Hwa-sun

1023
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,472
What kind of music she listens to

1024
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,315
What kind of things she likes to talk about

1025
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,276
Which TV series make her cry

1026
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,872
Since when?

1027
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,838
What the hell happened?

1028
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,036
Your friend is a total psychopath

1029
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,714
Just now, he was caught in the act,
trying to kill Nam tae-woo

1030
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,029
He also confessed
to the murder of Kim Cheol-min

1031
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,469
What?

1032
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,756
And we talk through the walls

1033
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,549
the walls?

1034
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,955
I can hear everything Hwa-sun says

1035
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,153
She knows that too
So she talks to me through the wall

1036
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,272
She said to kill Kim Cheol-min

1037
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,476
She said she's miserable because of him

1038
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,031
So I did what she asked

1039
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,950
But how could she date another man?

1040
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,038
Bitch

1041
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,436
I should've killed her first

1042
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,038
I found this in your mailbox

1043
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,348
You received threatening calls
at the same time every day. Didn't you?

1044
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,912
We searched the call history
from a payphone booth

1045
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,275
the guy next door, he is a total psycho

1046
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,151
He just confessed
to the murder of Kim Cheol-min

1047
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,116
Stop there! Captain's going to be back soon

1048
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,350
- Just give me ten minutes!
- Detective Jo!

1049
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,953
Wake up, bastard

1050
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,758
Get up and look at me

1051
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,238
Seok-go
Stop with the acting

1052
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,157
You didn't kill Kim Cheol-min

1053
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,870
At first I thought...

1054
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,556
You took pity on Baek
and she asked for help

1055
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,551
So you unwillingly helped her move the body

1056
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,995
But the Kim Seok-go I know
He won't kill anyone for no reason

1057
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,479
Because he is rational and logical

1058
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,630
But I overlooked something

1059
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,237
that as long as the logic fits,
you can be the most brutal person

1060
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,993
that day, I saw the way

1061
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,153
you looked at Baek

1062
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,149
Oh, this bastard is in love

1063
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,353
then, when Kim Seok-go falls in love,

1064
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,079
what would he do?

1065
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,958
When his loved one is in danger

1066
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,232
He will plan something. Right?

1067
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,474
A flawless and perfect plan!

1068
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,833
That's interesting but...

1069
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,353
A hypothesis needs a proof
in order to become true

1070
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,272
Fucker! Are you going to ruin your life
for that woman?

1071
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,437
I just confessed to the
murder of Kim Cheol-min

1072
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,350
Even if you solve everything,

1073
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,556
my trial would've been over by then

1074
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,514
If I get convicted in the first ruling
and I don't appeal,

1075
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,832
then Kim Cheol-min case is over

1076
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,159
No, no. this is wrong
You're out of your mind

1077
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:47,029
this is not love
this is not real

1078
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,358
How can you waste your genius brain?

1079
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:54,676
It's not about my brain

1080
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,072
It's my heart

1081
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,033
Bastard...

1082
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:12,555
Bastard
You shouldn't have let me catch you

1083
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,559
Bastard

1084
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:27,470
Let me ask just one favor

1085
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,433
Ms. Baek

1086
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:50,631
I don't know where to begin

1087
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,955
I don't know what's happening right now

1088
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,950
But I came here to confess
the things I've been hiding

1089
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:18,353
Seok-go wanted me to give this to you

1090
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,155
I don't know what's in the letter

1091
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:31,068
But it's probably not
what I'm about to tell you

1092
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,357
It makes sense you don't know anything

1093
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,673
Because you've been doing
what Seok-go's been telling you

1094
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,833
It's only natural that you
passed the polygraph

1095
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,832
You never lied

1096
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,152
On Nov. 9th, you actually did dine out
and see a movie with your niece

1097
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,232
But you probably wondered why people
only kept asking about Nov. 9th

1098
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,031
because you killed Kim Cheol-min,
on the 8th of November

1099
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:13,469
Yes, Seok-go isn't innocent
He's guilty of a crime

1100
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,031
Mang-won district riverside murder

1101
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,118
Kim Seok-go is the killer

1102
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,636
He really did kill someone

1103
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,753
that day,

1104
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,953
the first day of murder on November 8th

1105
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,033
Seok-go probably contemplated
over the dead body

1106
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,197
If the police finds the body,
they will find the real killer

1107
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,475
Even if the body is never found

1108
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,951
he thought you would
live your life in agony,

1109
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,351
worrying when the body will turn up

1110
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,954
So Seok-go decided

1111
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,280
to commit another murder

1112
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,234
His plan was to trick us into believing
the body was Kim Cheol-min's

1113
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:06,275
Just in case, no matter what happens
he couldn't back out

1114
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,158
He perfectly blocked off his own exit
to make it impossible to undo

1115
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,989
Hello

1116
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,560
Inn

1117
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,555
Seok-go made someone you don't know
into Kim Cheol-min

1118
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,156
And kills him in the same way

1119
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,153
So the body we found wasn't
the real Kim Cheol-min

1120
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,238
And then some place where no one knows

1121
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,148
Seok-go probably hid Kim's body

1122
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,438
so that it can never be found

1123
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,638
But you see

1124
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,756
the person Seok-go wanted
to deceive perfectly

1125
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,838
was you, Ms. Baek

1126
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,439
that's why Seok-go stalked you

1127
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:55,751
But then, an unexpected variable
me, popped up

1128
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,668
Protecting someone until the end

1129
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,510
Even taking the blame for
someone else's murder

1130
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,953
Is this possible for a normal person?
I'm not sure

1131
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,834
Are you his family? Are you his wife?

1132
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,831
You're not even his girlfriend

1133
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,396
From the beginning,

1134
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,796
he planned to take the blames for you

1135
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,152
So now

1136
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,150
Everything is up to you

1137
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:44,228
I just don't want that stupid bastard...

1138
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,550
to be miserable

1139
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,718
this is my heartfelt honesty

1140
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,238
And it is the truth

1141
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,477
I want to thank you for everything

1142
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:39,269
Because of you,
I was able to keep going with my life

1143
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,753
I don't know

1144
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,638
I don't know!

1145
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,158
Auntie, what are you doing?

1146
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,230
Huh? Hand me that

1147
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,834
Wow, you put everything in order

1148
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,991
May I bring in the ones outside?

1149
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,149
No

1150
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,270
Until you showed up in my life

1151
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:47,353
I only thought about dying

1152
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,040
I believed math was
the only perfect thing in life

1153
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,435
So when I couldn't find
the answers anymore,

1154
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:06,039
the joy became agony and despair

1155
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,271
Maybe it was the loneliness

1156
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,030
- Hi
- Hi

1157
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,158
We just moved in next door

1158
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,274
Here

1159
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:47,670
My aunt made it
I can't guarantee the taste

1160
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,038
Is there maybe something I can help?

1161
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,233
Pardon?

1162
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,832
It's nothing, bye

1163
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,830
That guy is a bit...

1164
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:29,555
But you can't guarantee the taste?

1165
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:31,039
I'm joking

1166
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,837
You know what's in those rice balls?

1167
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,238
That's when I realized

1168
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:14,468
There's something essentially as beautiful

1169
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,756
as the beauty of math in this world

1170
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,879
Hello

1171
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:28,958
Hello

1172
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,874
Miss

1173
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,554
those rice balls were good

1174
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:37,711
that's great

1175
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,948
If you want, you can eat it every day

1176
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,355
You really came

1177
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,877
Hello, sir!

1178
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,757
I'm late

1179
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,751
Hwa-sun and Yoon-ah

1180
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,551
Thank you so much

1181
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,358
Mr. Nam seems sincere and trustworthy

1182
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,748
I hope he makes you happy

1183
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,754
Please forget everything about me

1184
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,755
and what had happened
Don't ever feel sorry for me

1185
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,356
If you are not happy,

1186
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,637
all my effort becomes meaningless

1187
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,348
If you ever turn yourself in
because of guilty conscience

1188
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,840
There's no longer a reason for me to live

1189
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,475
This is my last request

1190
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:13,072
I'll always pray for your happiness

1191
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,552
Always, Kim Seok-go

1192
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,153
Seok-go

1193
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,153
Wait

1194
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:03,398
Seok-go, wait
Just need a word

1195
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,799
- What is it?
- Please Seok-go

1196
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,439
- Stop the bus
- Isn't that Baek Hwa-sun?

1197
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,428
Can you see me?

1198
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,359
Can you hear me?

1199
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,552
I'm sorry, Seok-go

1200
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,356
Sorry I said I feel suffocated

1201
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,112
I shouldn't have said that

1202
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,957
Seok-go, I...

1203
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:35,032
Seok-go! Why did you do all this for me?

1204
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:38,348
You can't just go away like this

1205
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,159
Seok-go

1206
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,550
- Let's get going
- Seok-go

1207
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,788
Seok-go, Seok-go!

1208
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,153
Ms. Baek!

1209
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,078
- Seok-go!
- Ms. Baek!

1210
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,750
What will happen to him?

1211
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:18,829
This is all because of me

1212
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,672
You're the sole reason I'm still here

1213
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,839
I'm so sorry

1214
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:05,192
