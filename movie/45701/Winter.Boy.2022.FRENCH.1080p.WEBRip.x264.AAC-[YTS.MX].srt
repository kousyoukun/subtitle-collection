WINTER BOY

4
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:58,686
- Don't you want to drive?
- No.

5
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:15,894
It's all right.

6
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:48,853
My name is Lucas,

7
00:02:49,228 --> 00:02:52,603
and my life has become a wild animal

8
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,686
that I can't approach
without getting bitten.

9
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,603
<i>All my ideas frighten me.</i>

10
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:02,936
<i>I recognize nothing now.</i>

11
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:06,394
<i>Everything in my mind
feels like a threat.</i>

12
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,353
<i>It has to end.</i>

13
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:15,144
<i>I have to be able
to start over again.</i>

14
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,436
<i>I feel it deep inside.</i>

15
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:20,769
<i>It's like an inner need
rotting my brain.</i>

16
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:23,478
<i>Something keeps telling me</i>

17
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,228
<i>to gather everything together.</i>

18
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:32,436
<i>I must see what happened again,
or I'm lost and it's over.</i>

19
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:36,478
I don't know if I should fear
it's already over.

20
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,603
It's stupid
fearing what has already happened.

21
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,644
<i>Before, I was just
a high school student.</i>

22
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,394
Getting started is the hard part.

23
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,603
Maybe I've started,
but that's not the case.

24
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,186
<i>I'm at high school.</i>

25
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,061
<i>My name's Lucas.</i>

26
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,811
<i>I'm 17.</i>

27
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:03,269
<i>But I feel even that isn't me anymore.</i>

28
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:05,978
<i>Oscar boards too.</i>

29
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,478
He lives in my village,
one hour from school.

30
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:11,769
<i>But...</i>

31
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,311
<i>We take the bus together</i>

32
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:15,978
<i>every Monday morning.</i>

33
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,728
I don't want to think about him now.

34
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,144
I'll talk about him later.
I'll start with my dad.

35
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,811
<i>Dad taking me to school by car.</i>

36
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,478
<i>Two weeks ago.</i>

37
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,644
<i>When I was still intact.</i>

38
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,436
<i>We're approaching Chambéry.</i>

39
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:38,853
<i>I watch my father driving.</i>

40
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,519
<i>We hadn't seen each other much,</i>

41
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:44,978
<i>with his work.</i>

42
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,228
<i>We don't have much to say
to each other.</i>

43
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:50,436
<i>But I remember him saying...</i>

44
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:51,894
What's up, kiddo?

45
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,228
<i>...he could've had another life,</i>

46
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,103
<i>not that
of a valley village prosthodontist.</i>

47
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,269
Don't screw up the year.

48
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:05,561
I won't be a drag
and say high school is important,

49
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,603
but it all begins there.

50
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:10,228
Fine, say what you think.

51
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:11,978
Don't get regrets later.

52
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:15,478
When I was your age,
if I'd been more disciplined,

53
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:18,228
I might have another life.

54
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:20,644
I could have lived differently.

55
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:23,478
You're not happy?

56
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,311
That's not the issue.

57
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:28,269
<i>I know you said it to motivate me,</i>

58
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:31,769
<i>but you dared to question your life
in front of me.</i>

59
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:35,811
<i>What I felt then,
sitting by you in that car,</i>

60
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,144
<i>was sorrow.</i>

61
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:38,811
<i>Because I know</i>

62
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:41,936
<i>I agree with you.</i>

63
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:46,228
<i>I too would have wanted better for you.</i>

64
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,561
<i>I wanted to say something
kind and reassuring,</i>

65
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:50,728
<i>but had no time.</i>

66
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:58,269
<i>I thought I'd die in your arms.</i>

67
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,186
<i>I remember thinking</i>

68
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:04,519
<i>I'd prefer to die</i>

69
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:06,561
<i>in those arms.</i>

70
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,644
<i>Why didn't I die that morning?</i>

71
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:07,853
Come here.

72
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,519
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

73
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,144
Are you OK? You're not injured?

74
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:21,936
Let's get out of here.

75
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,728
No need to tell your mother.

76
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,478
Not your fault, that jerk overtook you.

77
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,561
I know it wasn't my fault.

78
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,478
It's probably stupid to think

79
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,436
it was like a sign

80
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:53,144
or a prediction.

81
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:56,061
But that's what I believe now.

82
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:00,686
I think I was warned that morning
something would happen.

83
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:03,936
I was sent a sign.

84
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:06,061
It came from above.

85
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:11,478
I didn't understand.
I didn't realize it announced death.

86
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:33,686
Good night.

87
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:40,186
Time for bed.

88
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:42,936
See you tomorrow. Good night.

89
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:53,061
- Lights out, Lucas.
- I'll just finish.

90
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:54,811
We have a test tomorrow.

91
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,103
All right.

92
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:59,061
I just need a quick word with him.

93
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,228
Hurry.

94
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,061
We'll meet up in Victor's room.

95
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,853
No, not tonight.

96
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,436
- I have work.
- Good night.

97
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,186
Remember your mask, Milo.

98
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:11,310
Don't worry.

99
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:12,644
Good night.

100
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,644
It's Mr Loison, Lucas.

101
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:58,561
<i>Mr Loison enters the room.</i>

102
00:10:58,728 --> 00:10:59,978
<i>My room.</i>

103
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,103
<i>He's my parents' neighbour.</i>

104
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:04,894
<i>He taught me physics at middle school.</i>

105
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:07,644
<i>My brother is there but avoids me.</i>

106
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:09,478
You have to come with us.

107
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:11,061
<i>I greet my cousin.</i>

108
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,311
<i>When I touch the skin of her cheeks,
I feel it's strange for a dream,</i>

109
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:19,103
<i>to have such a real sense of touch.</i>

110
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:25,769
Get dressed.

111
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:33,561
Mr Loison says
I have to go with them now,

112
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:36,978
that we'll come back later
to pick up my things.

113
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:39,519
He speaks like dictating an exercise.

114
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:41,644
<i>He tells me to dress.</i>

115
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:42,811
What's up?

116
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:47,144
Your father had a car accident
last night.

117
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:50,103
He's in hospital.

118
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:52,269
Is it serious?

119
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,436
<i>I invent a story.</i>

120
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,394
<i>I think my father had his accident</i>

121
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:59,644
<i>while delivering to dentists.</i>

122
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:01,728
<i>I think of last night's storm.</i>

123
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,478
<i>My father aquaplaned.</i>

124
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:06,311
<i>No idea where I heard that,
but I cling to it.</i>

125
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,894
<i>His car skidded into the ditch.</i>

126
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,894
<i>My father with crutches.</i>

127
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,186
<i>His accident,</i>

128
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:17,769
<i>the way others pass exams,
have birthdays or tumours.</i>

129
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,603
Is Dad dead?

130
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:18,561
<i>I enter our house.</i>

131
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,394
<i>I first see my mother's sister.</i>

132
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:24,603
<i>I give her a kiss. I smile.</i>

133
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,644
<i>I embrace my father's parents.</i>

134
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,186
<i>I say, "Hello, how are you?"</i>

135
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,269
<i>How can I ask how they are?</i>

136
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,019
<i>I feel ashamed because of that.</i>

137
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:38,728
Be brave.

138
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:40,686
<i>Yet I ask everyone I see.</i>

139
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:44,811
<i>I should shut up, but I smile,
"Hello, how are you?"</i>

140
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,436
<i>I hear them telling me
to be brave,</i>

141
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:53,769
<i>to be a man,
not to scare my mother...</i>

142
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,811
Long time, no see.

143
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:02,436
<i>But I don't scare anyone
as I smile and embrace them all.</i>

144
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:05,769
Lucas...

145
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:07,519
My little darling.

146
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,394
Why didn't you say he was here?

147
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:14,061
I wanted to tell him.

148
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:15,894
He knows, Isabelle.

149
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:26,394
Come on.

150
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,561
I was worried because

151
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,436
he didn't come home after his rounds.

152
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:45,561
The police came to tell me.

153
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,353
His car

154
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:53,228
swerved
and rammed into a truck opposite.

155
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:55,853
We don't know why,
it's inexplicable.

156
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:02,728
Maybe he fell asleep or...

157
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:05,103
We don't know.

158
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:07,061
He died instantly.

159
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,728
There was no one to fetch you.

160
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:15,603
Quentin

161
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:18,311
managed to get back from Paris.

162
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,353
He arrived in the night.

163
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,019
I wanted to tell you myself, sweetheart.

164
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,769
Where is he?

165
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:33,519
At the hospital.

166
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,936
I couldn't see him yesterday...

167
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:43,019
It took a long time to get him out...

168
00:16:45,894 --> 00:16:47,644
They're taking him...

169
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:52,061
to the funeral home in Chambéry.

170
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:15,728
Mum, you're...

171
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,728
You're still young.

172
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:20,644
You can start a new life.

173
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,144
Sweetheart...

174
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,103
Quentin, come here.

175
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:32,478
Come here.

176
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,436
<i>I try to focus, to think,</i>

177
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,894
<i>but all I can think of</i>

178
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:52,978
<i>is someone will yell at me
for getting my shoes on the bed.</i>

179
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:57,394
<i>All of a sudden,</i>

180
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:00,603
<i>I feel everything shatter within me.</i>

181
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:06,561
<i>My lungs start burning up.</i>

182
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,894
Come here...

183
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:27,728
Come here, sonny.

184
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,561
Let me.

185
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:38,894
Sweetheart, calm down.

186
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,353
Calm down.

187
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,228
There, sweetheart...

188
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:44,894
Calm down.

189
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:48,978
It'll be OK.

190
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,686
Uncover his shoulder.

191
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,978
- It'll be OK.
- It'll help you relax.

192
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:58,478
I don't want it, I don't.

193
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:00,436
Calm down.

194
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:01,894
Here goes.

195
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,519
There, it's over.

196
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:20,478
Let's leave them.

197
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,894
We must pray for him.

198
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:17,394
His face looks good,
you needn't be afraid.

199
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:20,353
Hold on, a friend's here.

200
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:22,769
You'll regret it.

201
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,603
- Been here long?
- Just got here.

202
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:27,853
We'll take a walk.

203
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,936
How's your mother?

204
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,769
I haven't seen her much.

205
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:35,186
The whole family turned up.

206
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:36,936
I feel in the way.

207
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,311
She forces herself to welcome people.

208
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,769
You can sleep at my place.

209
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,394
My parents offered.

210
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:46,478
No, I have to stay with them.

211
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:49,019
When'll you be back at school?

212
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:51,103
- I might not be back.
- Really?

213
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,894
I can't stay a boarder.

214
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:55,353
I need to be closer to my mother.

215
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:57,478
Nothing's decided yet.

216
00:20:57,644 --> 00:21:00,144
We can't talk with everyone here.

217
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:02,769
Not the priests at St Marc?

218
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,311
I might have no choice.

219
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,353
I understand.

220
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:14,478
Besides, school, now...

221
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:23,353
How do you feel?

222
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:30,103
I dunno.

223
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,061
I feel sort of anaesthetized.

224
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,936
I've always known your dad.

225
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:54,686
Are you crying?

226
00:21:57,603 --> 00:21:59,728
It won't help me if you cry.

227
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,186
It's not love, you know.

228
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,436
I know.

229
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,144
Maybe one day.

230
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:29,561
Maybe one day, but not with me.

231
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,353
What's that chimney over there?

232
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:37,103
A factory.

233
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:40,144
They must burn disgusting stuff.
It stinks.

234
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:42,103
Right, they're waiting for me.

235
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:49,144
Can you turn it up?

236
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:58,644
Beautiful.

237
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:00,726
I like it.

238
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:02,103
Beautiful, isn't it?

239
00:23:26,728 --> 00:23:29,811
I'd also like our song,
your father's and mine.

240
00:23:30,228 --> 00:23:32,311
- We can't play that.
- We can.

241
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:35,269
The song we dance to every Christmas.

242
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,311
We can't play it in the church.

243
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:38,728
It's what I want.

244
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,686
Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark?

245
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,769
That won't work.

246
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:04,103
I'm not sure.

247
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,144
Sure you won't come?
You can change your mind.

248
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,311
No, it's OK.

249
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:29,769
Stay here, nice and quiet, OK?

250
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:31,728
I'm sorry.

251
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,019
Not at all. It's OK.

252
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:36,144
All right, let's go.

253
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,603
See you later.

254
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,811
I'll look after the house.

255
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,728
He's creating a permanent buzz.

256
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:22,144
He goes on TV, he promotes his books.

257
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:26,311
He's even saying now
he may run for president.

258
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,476
You believe it?

259
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,186
No, he has no...

260
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:33,228
He has no potential as president,
he's a showman.

261
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:34,351
So what?

262
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:37,144
In a democracy,
he has the right to run.

263
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:39,686
Millions will vote for him.

264
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:42,894
A democracy?
Zemmour represents fascists.

265
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:45,644
The leftist's Godwin's law: a fascist.

266
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:47,769
Zemmour is a fascist.

267
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:50,853
A kid takes an interest
in politics for once

268
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:52,769
and gets labelled a fascist.

269
00:27:53,228 --> 00:27:55,603
Me taking an interest doesn't count.

270
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,186
It's just noise.

271
00:27:57,353 --> 00:27:59,519
He went to the Bataclan
on November 13th

272
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:02,019
to blame Hollande for the attacks.

273
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:03,853
What did he say?

274
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:06,769
He said the Bataclan attacks were...

275
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:07,935
Can I speak?

276
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:12,228
Hollande disrespected the French
by leaving the borders open.

277
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:15,061
He said Hollande
let Arabs into France.

278
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:18,894
He took a risk.
He didn't protect the French.

279
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:23,853
With closed borders,
there'd be no Bataclan, Charlie Hebdo,

280
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:26,019
and we'd have a normal youth.

281
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:29,894
So you mean all terrorists
are people who came

282
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:31,561
from a foreign country?

283
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:34,769
Where did the Bataclan shooters
come from?

284
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:37,186
Enough of this crap in my father's home.

285
00:28:37,353 --> 00:28:39,228
So shut up, Christophe,

286
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:41,811
and you too Basile, get it?

287
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,686
Tell me something.

288
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:56,144
Did the priest say
Dad didn't believe in God?

289
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:57,769
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

290
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:01,686
It was a nice ceremony.

291
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:04,686
The church was packed.

292
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:08,103
The speeches were very moving.

293
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:09,311
Come with me.

294
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,853
Quentin...

295
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:21,019
Sit here and calm down.

296
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:25,769
Bravo.

297
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:29,853
It's not a day for that kind of thing.

298
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,269
It's a funeral.
Not a political rally.

299
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:34,978
He'd talk politics.

300
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:36,311
No one minded.

301
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,186
I'll leave tomorrow.

302
00:29:48,978 --> 00:29:52,394
I have important appointments.
A curator's coming Wednesday

303
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:55,686
to see my work. I can't postpone it.

304
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,561
Besides, in any case,

305
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,186
staying here gets me down.

306
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,478
I'm counting on you, Lucas.

307
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,644
It's a new responsibility for you.

308
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:09,769
I know you didn't expect it but...

309
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:13,936
It's landed on you, like the rest of us.

310
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,603
Maybe you should change schools
and go to St Marc.

311
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:22,561
You'd be here every evening.
What d'you say?

312
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:26,478
Quentin, I don't want to go back
to high school.

313
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:28,603
I know, it stresses you out,

314
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:30,353
but you have no choice.

315
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:34,603
You have exams this year.
You need to get to work.

316
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:37,894
Besides, it's better for you

317
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:41,186
to focus on something.
It'll occupy your mind.

318
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:44,353
That's a totally dumb thing to say.

319
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:45,811
It's stupid.

320
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,436
I don't want my mind occupied
until it passes.

321
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:50,644
It won't pass right away.

322
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,561
Our old life is over.

323
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,061
So I want everything to change.

324
00:30:58,436 --> 00:30:59,853
It isn't over.

325
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,061
We'll manage without him.

326
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:04,644
You're right.

327
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:08,311
Easy for you.
You've managed without us for years.

328
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:13,478
Two years of high school is nothing.

329
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:16,228
Then you can do what you want.

330
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:21,728
What?

331
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:25,728
You don't care about us.

332
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:29,186
Why do I bother?
You don't get it.

333
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,019
All you want to do

334
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:33,728
is get back to Paris, your friends,

335
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:36,394
and your career that's taking off.

336
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,811
Don't worry, Mum and I will stay here,

337
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,436
in our place, and deal with grief.

338
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:43,728
Shut up.

339
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,894
You'll be back in three months
for Mum's birthday,

340
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:48,228
then for mine,

341
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:51,353
then...
You'll bring nice little presents.

342
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,186
But then leave again.

343
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:54,853
And, after that,

344
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:57,353
we can hope for you at Christmas.

345
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:59,394
And that's all.

346
00:31:59,894 --> 00:32:02,394
- Think what you like.
- You make me sick.

347
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,644
You just want us out of your life.

348
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:06,228
Shut your mouth!

349
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:09,394
Stop pissing me off, OK?

350
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,103
I'm sick of it!

351
00:32:14,603 --> 00:32:15,811
- Quentin!
- Piss off!

352
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,936
Don't touch me, you hear!

353
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:22,686
It's over! Don't touch me again!

354
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,019
Lucas!

355
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:29,353
Lucas, come here!

356
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,686
Leave him, let's go back in.
Let him have his meltdown.

357
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,103
Mum, come inside now.

358
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,103
Don't tell me how to deal
with your brother!

359
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,394
Go in, it's not a show.

360
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,144
Asshole!

361
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:44,936
Why does he hate me?

362
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:46,853
Don't be silly. Come here.

363
00:32:47,394 --> 00:32:50,269
Let's go back, we'll catch a chill.
Come on.

364
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:55,061
You go. I'm sick of them all.

365
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:57,144
Make an effort. Come on.

366
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,311
They're here to help us, OK?

367
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:05,978
Once they all leave,
the house will be very empty.

368
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:09,269
I'll enrol at St Marc,

369
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,978
so you won't be alone.

370
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:13,478
No, that's out of the question.

371
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:18,436
Stay with your friends in Chambéry.
I'll see you at weekends.

372
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:21,936
I don't need you or your brother
to look after me.

373
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:25,061
I have to keep on
looking after you both.

374
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:29,311
I can see the year out.
Then we'll see about next year.

375
00:33:29,478 --> 00:33:30,936
No, we won't.

376
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,436
Don't start worrying. Come on.

377
00:33:36,103 --> 00:33:37,561
What'll you do?

378
00:33:38,478 --> 00:33:39,644
What'll you do?

379
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,269
I'll go back to work at school.

380
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,311
The children need me.

381
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:49,061
I'm their teacher.
They're learning to read.

382
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,519
What'll you do for yourself, Mum?

383
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:56,728
I'm going to wait.

384
00:33:57,228 --> 00:33:59,019
I have no other choice

385
00:33:59,644 --> 00:34:02,228
but to get by without your father.
I'll try...

386
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:05,353
to accept it.

387
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:09,978
Maybe, one day, I'll be really old
and tell myself

388
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:13,478
I was lucky to grow old,
unlike your father.

389
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:17,936
Got a cigarette for me?

390
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,269
A trick question?

391
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,894
Give me one if you have any.
I'm sure you do.

392
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,936
Where are they? There they are.

393
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:31,978
We left you dessert.

394
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:34,269
No, thanks.
D'you want some?

395
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:10,769
Be brave.

396
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:12,644
Bye.

397
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:34,811
- I can't make it.
- You can.

398
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,353
You'll make it.

399
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:43,811
I'll help you.

400
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:52,478
I've lost everything.

401
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,561
In the veranda...

402
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:22,144
I suggest

403
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:25,394
taking Lucas to Paris with me
for a week.

404
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,186
I can't take care of you much,
but it'll be a break before school.

405
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:34,728
If Mum agrees,
we'll leave tomorrow.

406
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:37,436
Would you like that?

407
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:41,353
Yes.

408
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:44,269
I won't have much time for you.

409
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:47,019
We leave at 9 for the station.

410
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:51,394
Can I sleep at Oscar's?

411
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:52,893
At Oscar's?

412
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:55,103
- Can I sleep there?
- Yes.

413
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:00,103
Pack your bag for Paris first.

414
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:07,561
I love you both.

415
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:28,894
<i>At Oscar's, I decided
on a new destiny for myself.</i>

416
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:31,103
I wanted to live alone,

417
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:34,103
refusing to let anyone
make demands of me.

418
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:38,644
It was more than a resolution,
it was a vow.

419
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,894
I didn't want to owe anyone anything.

420
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:49,978
<i>For that, I was ready to sacrifice
the very idea of love.</i>

421
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,311
What're you looking for?

422
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:55,894
I'm putting some music on.

423
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,228
You're here too?

424
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:19,936
I couldn't find Dad's grave.

425
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:22,811
I thought it was that one
with flowers.

426
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,436
No, it's this one.

427
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:29,811
I can go if you want to be alone.

428
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:33,853
What do you think Dad thought of me?

429
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:36,144
Apart from being a ball-buster?

430
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,186
Me being a fag disappointed him.

431
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,144
No. Why?
He never said anything like that.

432
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,936
He knew before I did. I remember.

433
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:48,561
I was 8 or 9 at the time.

434
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:54,269
I still see
the dismayed look you got, Dad,

435
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:57,186
when the two of us were alone at home.

436
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:01,894
You looked worn out in advance.

437
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,894
As if he'd made up his mind about me
long before,

438
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:09,603
and that I'd bring him nothing good.

439
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:12,228
Don't say that.
And don't believe it.

440
00:41:12,394 --> 00:41:13,769
It's not true, OK?

441
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:16,769
Dad never thought like that.

442
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:18,811
He loved you completely.

443
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,519
Get that shit out of your mind.

444
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:23,103
Don't blame the dead.

445
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:24,269
Why not?

446
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:28,603
We leave in 40 minutes.

447
00:41:40,894 --> 00:41:43,978
If a client arrives,
act like we don't know him, OK?

448
00:41:46,186 --> 00:41:47,936
Usually, he waits there.

449
00:42:06,311 --> 00:42:07,603
Hi, I'm Lucas.

450
00:42:07,853 --> 00:42:09,228
Lilio, delighted.

451
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,186
C'mon, Quentin.

452
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,144
It'll be good

453
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:34,769
if you give him your keys...

454
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:38,103
I'll sleep at Lara's.
I won't join you.

455
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:41,061
Lucas will be there when you get back.

456
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:42,728
When do you finish?

457
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:46,019
6 pm, but I can do stuff
if you want to go out.

458
00:42:46,186 --> 00:42:47,186
He'll stay in.

459
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:49,019
I gave him money to make dinner.

460
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,186
He's already exploiting you.
Watch out.

461
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:55,435
My client.

462
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:56,478
Wait for me?

463
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:01,519
The stop is Place des Fêtes.

464
00:43:01,811 --> 00:43:03,644
I noted the address, door code

465
00:43:04,478 --> 00:43:05,978
and floor for you, OK?

466
00:43:11,561 --> 00:43:12,561
Sorry, guys.

467
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:14,394
Drop us at the apartment?

468
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,061
Sorry,
all I can offer is the garage.

469
00:43:18,353 --> 00:43:20,436
I'd like to see the garage.

470
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:21,603
Get in.

471
00:43:21,978 --> 00:43:23,728
No, Lara's waiting for me.

472
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:25,186
I'll take Lucas.

473
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,894
- Sure?
- Yeah, he'd like that, right?

474
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:29,728
OK, see you later.

475
00:43:29,894 --> 00:43:31,644
See you. Kiss Lara for me.

476
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:33,228
Come on, get in.

477
00:44:26,603 --> 00:44:29,186
"You haven't hurt yourself
Just as I thought

478
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:33,978
It's no use
Sheltering from the wind

479
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,811
We are just seashells
Scattered over the sand

480
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,394
With no chance of return

481
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:44,978
To when the sea was calm"

482
00:44:49,894 --> 00:44:52,103
Lucas, forgive me. I'm sorry.

483
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:54,436
Sorry.

484
00:44:56,436 --> 00:44:57,978
I'm an idiot, I didn't think.

485
00:44:58,144 --> 00:45:01,019
Not at all.
It's a pretty song too.

486
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:03,144
I'm sorry.

487
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:07,769
Come here.

488
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:13,186
Thanks.

489
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:28,353
It's me. Am I calling too late?

490
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,936
Not at all, sweetheart.
It's good to hear you.

491
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:33,519
You're already in bed?

492
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:35,103
<i>No, I'm...</i>

493
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:39,394
I'm in my bedroom.
I was just reading a bit.

494
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:41,186
So...

495
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:45,228
Tell me, how was your first day?

496
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:48,436
Great. Really great.

497
00:45:49,853 --> 00:45:51,144
<i>I'm happy I'm here.</i>

498
00:45:52,894 --> 00:45:53,936
It's so cool.

499
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:57,519
Where did your brother take you today?

500
00:45:57,686 --> 00:45:59,686
<i>He showed me the neighbourhood.</i>

501
00:45:59,978 --> 00:46:03,436
Then he took me to see the Seine.

502
00:46:03,603 --> 00:46:04,644
At the Pont-Neuf?

503
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:08,561
I forget the name of the bridge.

504
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:10,811
The Pont-Neuf is by the Louvre.

505
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,853
You have to see the Louvre.

506
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,936
Try to see what you can't see here.

507
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:18,978
I'll do that. I'll ask him.

508
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:23,311
There's the Jeu de Paume Museum too.

509
00:46:24,436 --> 00:46:26,769
In that same area. It's the one

510
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:30,186
with Monet's big <i>Waterlilies.</i>

511
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:31,894
I don't know them.

512
00:46:32,228 --> 00:46:34,019
But I guess Quentin will.

513
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:37,894
Make him take you.
He knows all that by heart.

514
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:40,978
I'll do that. I'll do that.

515
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:42,478
Got that, Mum.

516
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:47,811
How about you?

517
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:50,936
How do you feel?

518
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,103
It's quieter now.

519
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:58,769
Only Auntie and Granny are still here.

520
00:47:00,228 --> 00:47:04,603
We were at the bank this morning
for your father's life insurance.

521
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:08,644
I need to talk to you about it
as you get a share each.

522
00:47:09,228 --> 00:47:12,353
I'm not making money
from Dad's death.

523
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:14,644
Don't start, Lucas.

524
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:16,978
You'll need it to study.

525
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:19,019
Take it all. I want nothing.

526
00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:22,561
<i>Listen, I'll explain better
when you get back, OK?</i>

527
00:47:23,186 --> 00:47:26,394
Listen.
I don't want to hear about that money.

528
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:30,894
I know it sounds absurd,
like you're benefiting from it, but no.

529
00:47:31,978 --> 00:47:33,103
Your father wanted it.

530
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:36,228
Let's stop claiming
what Dad would have wanted.

531
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:39,686
He'd have wanted to live longer.
No one knows the rest.

532
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:42,728
<i>Don't be so harsh.</i>

533
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44,144
I have to be.

534
00:47:49,228 --> 00:47:51,394
I asked you how you felt.

535
00:47:55,728 --> 00:47:57,894
It depends on the time of day.

536
00:47:58,061 --> 00:47:59,561
But don't worry,

537
00:47:59,936 --> 00:48:01,311
I'll be OK.

538
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:06,561
<i>Are you still there?</i>

539
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,561
<i>What are you doing?</i>

540
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,103
Nothing.

541
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:27,353
Why do we find it so hard
to say things are bad?

542
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:34,353
Are you taking the pills
Dr Dauvert gave you?

543
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:38,811
I'm tired, Mum, I think I'll go now.

544
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:43,186
<i>Call me tomorrow
to tell me about your day.</i>

545
00:48:43,478 --> 00:48:44,478
All right?

546
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,061
Love and kisses, sweetheart.

547
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:52,061
Love you, Mum. Lots and lots.

548
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:16,686
Hi!

549
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:18,144
Hi.

550
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,519
Up you get. It's already 11.

551
00:49:21,686 --> 00:49:23,519
- I need the place.
- I slept so well!

552
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,019
Sorry about last night.

553
00:49:27,186 --> 00:49:30,269
Lara was so upset about Dad,
I stayed with her.

554
00:49:30,436 --> 00:49:31,603
She didn't know him.

555
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,436
You can be upset for others.

556
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:35,603
Get up.

557
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:40,644
Yeah, give me five more minutes.

558
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,311
Did you touch my stuff?

559
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:44,061
No, I just looked.

560
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:45,894
That painting moved alone?

561
00:49:46,186 --> 00:49:48,603
If you use my room, touch nothing.

562
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:51,269
I looked, OK, I didn't touch.

563
00:49:51,436 --> 00:49:54,103
I saw some very pretty stuff.

564
00:49:55,394 --> 00:49:57,644
Come on now, get up.

565
00:49:58,144 --> 00:49:59,894
I need to tidy the place.

566
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:03,019
An important curator is due
in under an hour.

567
00:50:07,353 --> 00:50:09,019
You slept naked in my bed?

568
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:10,978
- C'mon...
- That's disgusting!

569
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:12,936
Put a bathrobe on.

570
00:50:13,103 --> 00:50:14,103
Has Lil left?

571
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:16,478
Yes, he works. It's Lilio, not Lil.

572
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:18,978
Lille is a city in northern France.

573
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:20,603
Make the bed, please.

574
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:22,686
Let me make coffee first.

575
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,853
Hurry, I need to concentrate.

576
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:27,061
Have coffee in a bar.

577
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:29,894
It'll be better.

578
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:31,353
I see you.

579
00:50:35,478 --> 00:50:38,103
<i>Butter in the fridge.
Have a good day, kid!</i>

580
00:50:50,144 --> 00:50:52,561
<i>You're the best, man!
The Ricard prize next.</i>

581
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:56,353
While the curator is here,

582
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:59,311
could I watch
while you show her your work?

583
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:02,686
I'm really interested in what you do.

584
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,686
And it'd help me understand better.

585
00:51:06,644 --> 00:51:11,519
Even if I know I'm not always supposed
to try to understand anything.

586
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:18,311
You're not answering?

587
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:21,561
The answer's no.
It's my work, not an open day.

588
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:24,769
I don't want you in our way.

589
00:51:24,936 --> 00:51:26,811
This appointment's important.

590
00:51:26,978 --> 00:51:29,186
It's bad enough not having a studio,

591
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:30,978
without my baby brother too.

592
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:32,436
Yeah, OK, I get it.

593
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:34,811
I'll see you for lunch.

594
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:36,644
But I'm not free, Lucas.

595
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:39,894
You said the lady
would be here in an hour.

596
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,936
It won't last all day, will it?

597
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:44,644
It'll last the time it takes.
I said an hour,

598
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:47,561
but she may not come
until this afternoon.

599
00:51:49,978 --> 00:51:51,561
It's sunny, I'll take a walk.

600
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,918
Great, take a walk.
Try to stay out

601
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:55,019
until 6 pm.

602
00:51:55,186 --> 00:51:57,811
6 pm? What'll I do until 6 pm?

603
00:51:58,394 --> 00:52:00,644
I don't know. You wanted to come.

604
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:02,353
Walk, see a movie...

605
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:05,936
There's a pool nearby,
I can lend you a bathing cap.

606
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:08,311
Work it out. You're not a baby.

607
00:52:13,186 --> 00:52:16,019
<i>If you're proud to be Parisian,
clap your hands.</i>

608
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:19,311
<i>If you're proud to be Parisian,
clap your hands.</i>

609
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,394
Are you jerking my chain?
Get going.

610
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:27,353
Yeah, I'm jerking it.
Don't touch me, asshole!

611
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
I get it, I'm going.

612
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:31,186
You bet you are.

613
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:33,644
I warned you, so don't whinge now.

614
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:44,686
However much you tidy up,
your place will still suck.

615
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:46,728
How can you make
a good impression?

616
00:52:46,771 --> 00:52:47,786
Shut up!

617
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:49,829
Shut up and get the hell out!

618
00:52:49,894 --> 00:52:53,228
I have an important appointment
and you piss me off!

619
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:56,186
Screw your appointment,
I don't need you!

620
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:58,144
I wish. Get out!

621
00:52:58,603 --> 00:53:01,894
Here, ten euros for food,
now piss off.

622
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,019
And stay out till 6!

623
00:53:23,936 --> 00:53:28,603
<i>I don't want to talk now
about my first day alone in Paris.</i>

624
00:53:30,353 --> 00:53:32,103
<i>It had its importance,</i>

625
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:34,936
<i>but I didn't know that at the time.</i>

626
00:53:35,394 --> 00:53:37,853
I thought it was important.

627
00:53:40,103 --> 00:53:43,936
I'm getting mixed up.
I don't know what to say exactly,

628
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:48,311
but it was a day when I walked a lot.

629
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:50,269
When I felt cold.

630
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:55,186
I won't lie, so I'll say
it's also a day I met someone

631
00:53:55,978 --> 00:53:57,936
and when I spoke to a priest.

632
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:02,061
<i>I got back at 6 pm,</i>

633
00:54:02,603 --> 00:54:04,603
<i>as Quentin had asked.</i>

634
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,144
<i>I hadn't been in touch all day</i>

635
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:10,686
<i>out of pride, I admit,</i>

636
00:54:10,853 --> 00:54:12,561
<i>cos things had happened.</i>

637
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:16,519
<i>When I got back, the door was locked
and I panicked.</i>

638
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:21,269
<i>For a few seconds, I thought
he didn't want me there again.</i>

639
00:54:24,853 --> 00:54:26,186
Quentin, it's me.

640
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:28,603
I'm at the door, but no one's here.

641
00:54:33,394 --> 00:54:36,561
Do I wait for you here or come there?

642
00:54:38,686 --> 00:54:40,144
What's the name again?

643
00:54:54,894 --> 00:54:56,019
How's it going?

644
00:54:57,144 --> 00:55:00,353
Sonia, meet my country brother, Lucas.

645
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:03,311
Sonia taught us
at the Cergy Art School.

646
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:04,686
We're celebrating.

647
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:07,103
The curator is programming me

648
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:09,228
at Lafayette Anticipations.

649
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:11,061
Excellent!

650
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,936
Who's the bouquet for?

651
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:16,019
For you.
I was sure it would go well.

652
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:18,519
Come here, kiddo.

653
00:55:19,144 --> 00:55:21,019
That's my baby brother.

654
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:25,186
Another round, Hamid, please.

655
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:26,353
What now?

656
00:55:27,186 --> 00:55:30,353
If we can't say anything,
it's hard to talk to you.

657
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:34,478
- He was at Art School too?
- Yes, we met there.

658
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:36,561
What you did then

659
00:55:36,728 --> 00:55:39,311
has played tricks on you since.

660
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:42,686
Students do caricatures of teachers.

661
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:44,978
It's healthy.
Plus you signed them

662
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:46,394
before posting them.

663
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:48,603
But that one was too much.

664
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:50,436
They weren't funny?

665
00:55:50,603 --> 00:55:53,603
The others were,
but that one was problematic.

666
00:55:54,228 --> 00:55:56,769
We were all so embarrassed for Hélène.

667
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,936
She wasn't. She never accused me.

668
00:56:00,103 --> 00:56:01,853
Everyone was furious.

669
00:56:03,228 --> 00:56:04,686
Thanks, Hamid.

670
00:56:10,478 --> 00:56:13,353
<i>I promised myself I'd stay silent.</i>

671
00:56:13,728 --> 00:56:16,644
<i>I didn't want them getting
a bad opinion of me.</i>

672
00:56:16,894 --> 00:56:19,853
<i>They were going to talk about art,
for sure.</i>

673
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:23,603
<i>I had to avoid speaking, above all.</i>

674
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:26,894
<i>Because I knew nothing</i>

675
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:30,978
<i>and, if I expressed an idea,
Quentin would demolish it</i>

676
00:56:31,144 --> 00:56:32,853
<i>and I'd look ridiculous.</i>

677
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:37,561
You drew her,
pursued by a hideous man

678
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,728
with all the codes of wealth,

679
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:41,644
and gave him clawed hands.

680
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:43,103
They weren't clawed.

681
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:47,311
And you gave her a big smile,
as if she wanted to be caught.

682
00:56:47,478 --> 00:56:50,228
She went on
about her bourgeois habitus,

683
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,865
I drew her
with the phantom of the bourgeoisie.

684
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:53,932
Period.

685
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:56,642
You joked by showing her
as a Jew unable

686
00:56:56,769 --> 00:56:58,561
to escape the demon of money.

687
00:57:01,644 --> 00:57:03,811
What are you working on?
I'd like...

688
00:57:03,978 --> 00:57:05,228
I'm not working.

689
00:57:05,394 --> 00:57:06,394
That's not true.

690
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:07,728
It is.

691
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:10,019
I park cars at the Gare de Lyon.

692
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:11,394
That's my work.

693
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:13,103
You're wrong to give up.

694
00:57:13,394 --> 00:57:14,686
Next autumn,

695
00:57:14,853 --> 00:57:17,936
there's a show on
"Art in Africa and its diaspora."

696
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:21,228
I could give the curator your file.

697
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:23,561
You have stuff, right?

698
00:57:24,186 --> 00:57:25,978
Sorry, I've nothing to offer.

699
00:57:26,144 --> 00:57:28,103
My family's Italian, you know.

700
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:32,061
That bitch,
demanding I give her African masks...

701
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:35,603
After insinuating my drawings
were anti-Semitic.

702
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:39,394
Checking my teeth
would be less perverse.

703
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:43,061
C'mon, she's fought
in anti-racist groups all her life.

704
00:57:43,228 --> 00:57:46,436
Thanks to whites like her,
you got into Fine Arts.

705
00:57:46,603 --> 00:57:49,644
White fragility now. Get lost.

706
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:51,603
So art is over for you?

707
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:52,769
It isn't.

708
00:57:52,853 --> 00:57:56,269
The gentleman may be anti-Semitic,
but he has talent.

709
00:57:56,436 --> 00:57:58,061
Separate the man from the artist.

710
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:02,269
Anti-Semitic, like any person of race
who shows up their racism.

711
00:58:02,436 --> 00:58:04,186
I'm sick of that too.

712
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:06,936
The bitch. I feel like dying.

713
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:09,811
Anti-Semitic and, I forgot,
a misogynist.

714
00:58:09,978 --> 00:58:11,186
I love this one.

715
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:12,436
It's beautiful.

716
00:58:12,603 --> 00:58:13,769
See the style?

717
00:58:13,936 --> 00:58:15,228
Yeah, I like it.

718
00:58:15,644 --> 00:58:17,936
I didn't expect it to be like this.

719
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:19,603
See the detail?

720
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:21,394
Can I show him this one?

721
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:24,894
- I think so.
- Show me everything.

722
00:58:26,061 --> 00:58:28,103
This gets straight to the point.

723
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:31,353
Hold on...

724
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:34,769
Say hi to your fans.

725
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:37,103
This one's for you.

726
00:58:45,728 --> 00:58:47,144
Show the secret ones.

727
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:51,686
Secret drawings?

728
00:58:51,853 --> 00:58:53,519
They're kind of private.

729
00:58:53,686 --> 00:58:55,061
Can I see them?

730
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,478
Go ahead, take a look.

731
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,311
In any case, it's all work.

732
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:05,061
It's funny.

733
00:59:06,061 --> 00:59:07,728
You only draw guys.

734
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:11,853
Yeah, male bodies in general.

735
00:59:14,603 --> 00:59:16,978
I got the balls wrong, but I like it.

736
00:59:17,144 --> 00:59:18,436
Two nice pears.

737
00:59:29,394 --> 00:59:31,311
You prefer those to my hives.

738
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:37,478
You did this in a mirror?

739
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:45,811
Sorry.

740
00:59:52,894 --> 00:59:55,144
That's the really daring stuff.

741
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:02,311
You want to sleep here, you drag?

742
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:06,353
I know never sharing a bed
is a family tradition,

743
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,478
but we could make an exception.

744
01:00:08,644 --> 01:00:11,978
I have no intention
of hearing or seeing you sleep.

745
01:00:24,436 --> 01:00:25,436
You know,

746
01:00:25,978 --> 01:00:27,894
you can talk about Dad to me.

747
01:00:33,311 --> 01:00:35,728
You can talk to me too if you want.

748
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:37,978
All right.

749
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:01,519
I promised to relate that first day.

750
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,686
It unfolded in two stages.

751
01:01:08,103 --> 01:01:11,894
<i>Between the two, I spent a lot of time</i>

752
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:15,186
<i>walking in the city, feeling cold...</i>

753
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:18,186
<i>The two stages</i>

754
01:01:19,103 --> 01:01:21,144
<i>have nothing in common.</i>

755
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:23,811
<i>Told this way, you might think</i>

756
01:01:24,061 --> 01:01:27,311
<i>that one has a connection
with the other, but no.</i>

757
01:01:28,103 --> 01:01:30,061
<i>It just happened like that.</i>

758
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,561
<i>I felt like praying
and I had a hook-up.</i>

759
01:01:37,954 --> 01:01:38,976
Hi.

760
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:41,144
Cool, you didn't lie about your age.

761
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:45,686
Do I close the door?

762
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:48,186
Coming?

763
01:01:56,436 --> 01:01:57,436
Hello.

764
01:01:58,644 --> 01:01:59,686
Hello.

765
01:02:02,478 --> 01:02:03,978
Beautiful, isn't it?

766
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:07,019
It's like a Rubens, but it isn't one.

767
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:08,519
Am I in the way?

768
01:02:08,686 --> 01:02:10,728
Why? The church is open.

769
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:17,686
It's OK, my parents
won't be back before 8.

770
01:02:26,353 --> 01:02:28,228
I feel like an idiot.

771
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:31,186
We can stop if I'm not your type.

772
01:02:31,353 --> 01:02:33,644
No, it's not that.

773
01:02:34,436 --> 01:02:37,561
I'm just not used
to direct hook-ups like this.

774
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:42,728
But I want that to change.

775
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:44,686
Why?

776
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,644
I don't know.

777
01:02:46,811 --> 01:02:48,936
I don't like my mind right now.

778
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:52,436
I'd prefer

779
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,019
my body to take all the space,

780
01:02:56,353 --> 01:02:59,061
with everything light as a feather.

781
01:02:59,228 --> 01:03:01,019
So allow yourself everything.

782
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:15,186
But I'm not quite there yet.

783
01:03:17,853 --> 01:03:19,228
He looks pretty dead.

784
01:03:19,894 --> 01:03:21,811
Yes, you're right.

785
01:03:22,853 --> 01:03:24,019
It seems hopeless.

786
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,435
And yet...

787
01:03:25,478 --> 01:03:26,978
May I ask

788
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:29,519
how can you explain the Resurrection?

789
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:33,061
Let's say...

790
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:36,436
the Resurrection is what gives hope,

791
01:03:36,611 --> 01:03:39,644
and what awakens within us
the desire

792
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:41,103
and courage to live.

793
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:45,561
But I don't think
that answers your question.

794
01:03:45,728 --> 01:03:47,894
It does actually.

795
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:52,478
I think I understand what it means.

796
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:54,144
It's like...

797
01:03:55,728 --> 01:03:58,228
a way to a lost supernatural life.

798
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:01,769
Something lost
that was returned to us.

799
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:04,269
The Resurrection

800
01:04:04,436 --> 01:04:06,686
is an integral part of Redemption.

801
01:04:07,603 --> 01:04:09,394
Death opens onto life,

802
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:12,394
and the Resurrection
ends the suffering on the Cross.

803
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:14,144
The mystery of suffering

804
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:17,019
only finds its ultimate solution

805
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:21,103
in the mystery of a dying
and glorified Christ.

806
01:04:22,894 --> 01:04:25,186
This will probably sound stupid,

807
01:04:25,353 --> 01:04:26,686
but I think...

808
01:04:27,936 --> 01:04:29,394
I see that like

809
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:32,519
suddenly recalling
something you had forgotten.

810
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:36,894
Have you lost someone recently?

811
01:04:38,936 --> 01:04:40,894
I don't want to talk about that.

812
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:45,936
I can't stay.

813
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:47,686
Thank you for listening.

814
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:52,019
That's a really dumb idea.

815
01:04:53,686 --> 01:04:54,436
Why?

816
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:56,561
Because I want to see you again.

817
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,144
That's kind.

818
01:05:00,478 --> 01:05:01,478
But...

819
01:05:03,853 --> 01:05:05,978
Once is good too, you know.

820
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:10,686
You're the first guy I had sex with
anonymously.

821
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:13,436
My name is...

822
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:15,728
No, say nothing. Shut up.

823
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:21,019
You'll meet guys less gifted than me.

824
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,519
You think so?

825
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,144
I'm sure of it.

826
01:05:26,103 --> 01:05:28,769
You're here for a week, so stay focused.

827
01:05:29,144 --> 01:05:30,894
Stick to one subject.

828
01:05:31,436 --> 01:05:34,936
Getting trapped
makes provincials attractive.

829
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:36,811
You're more Parisian than me.

830
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:39,269
You really think so?

831
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:43,644
That's provincial.
No Parisian is proud of being one.

832
01:05:44,019 --> 01:05:45,936
Your number or you don't leave.

833
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:55,269
My father died last week.

834
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:25,853
<i>That's how I spent my first day.</i>

835
01:06:26,394 --> 01:06:28,019
<i>But the memorable part,</i>

836
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:29,853
<i>what I found memorable,</i>

837
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:33,603
<i>is I spent the night that followed</i>

838
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:35,811
<i>in the same room as Lilio,</i>

839
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:38,436
<i>just centimetres from him.</i>

840
01:07:19,103 --> 01:07:21,186
- Want to get some air?
- Sure.

841
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:26,811
I was too cold in the hallway.

842
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:38,769
Heel on the trash bin.

843
01:07:42,936 --> 01:07:44,436
Come on, move.

844
01:07:51,436 --> 01:07:53,103
Ten to warm up.

845
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:54,853
Wake up.

846
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:57,936
The coach runs with his ankles, does he?

847
01:07:58,103 --> 01:07:59,478
Knees to hands.

848
01:07:59,878 --> 01:08:00,893
Higher.

849
01:08:00,936 --> 01:08:03,936
Maybe you're old, but I can run easy.

850
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:50,478
That's no good.
Stand on that thing for a better view.

851
01:08:55,894 --> 01:08:58,353
- Smile or not?
- Smile, it's for Mum.

852
01:09:03,603 --> 01:09:05,936
You don't mind me leaving you?

853
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:09,061
No, not at all, really.

854
01:09:09,853 --> 01:09:11,478
No worries.

855
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:15,519
Stay out till dinner.
Lilio needs to focus on his work.

856
01:09:15,686 --> 01:09:16,853
Yes, he told me.

857
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,478
I'll do the shopping and then...

858
01:09:19,644 --> 01:09:21,394
He may not stay for dinner.

859
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:22,436
Work it out.

860
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:24,936
The Orangerie Museum is easy.

861
01:09:25,103 --> 01:09:27,728
Walk across the Tuileries Gardens

862
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:31,061
till you reach two buildings
like Greek temples.

863
01:09:31,228 --> 01:09:32,978
On the right, the Jeu de Paume.

864
01:09:33,144 --> 01:09:36,436
Despite what Mum said,
the <i>Waterlilies</i> aren't there.

865
01:09:36,603 --> 01:09:38,103
Visit the left one.

866
01:09:39,144 --> 01:09:41,936
The entrance is at the front
or on the side.

867
01:09:42,103 --> 01:09:43,519
I should manage it.

868
01:09:43,686 --> 01:09:46,186
You can't really go wrong.

869
01:09:47,853 --> 01:09:50,228
I'm off, kiddo.
See you tomorrow.

870
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,769
Wait for me at home
so I can get in.

871
01:09:57,061 --> 01:09:59,186
The Louvre was fun with you.

872
01:10:00,728 --> 01:10:01,728
See you tomorrow.

873
01:10:01,894 --> 01:10:03,061
Bye.

874
01:10:20,394 --> 01:10:21,394
What's up?

875
01:10:21,769 --> 01:10:22,769
Back already?

876
01:10:22,894 --> 01:10:24,644
- Am I disturbing you?
- Yes.

877
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:26,644
I'm expecting someone.

878
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:29,228
Come back later.

879
01:10:29,394 --> 01:10:31,144
I'll stay in Quentin's room.

880
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,978
No, you really should go.

881
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:35,186
Hi, Thierry.

882
01:10:35,853 --> 01:10:37,353
- You OK?
- Can I come in?

883
01:10:37,519 --> 01:10:39,853
My friend's brother is just leaving.

884
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:41,228
He can stay.

885
01:10:41,644 --> 01:10:42,769
No, he's leaving.

886
01:10:42,936 --> 01:10:44,561
A threesome suits me.

887
01:10:44,728 --> 01:10:45,853
I'll pay extra.

888
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,978
Another 50, say.

889
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:50,394
- He's going.
- Yes, I'll leave you.

890
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:53,103
See you later.

891
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,353
- Have a good day.
- You too.

892
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:54,519
That's done.

893
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,686
If you need my services,
one on one, I'm ready.

894
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:00,186
Really?

895
01:12:01,061 --> 01:12:02,353
Aren't you a bit young?

896
01:12:04,103 --> 01:12:05,769
Got a phone number?

897
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:08,853
What's yours?

898
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:10,311
Hello, ma'am.

899
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:16,269
07 60 20 95 87.

900
01:12:23,436 --> 01:12:26,228
Now you can call me,
and I can call you.

901
01:12:30,769 --> 01:12:34,228
If we do it,
leave Lilio be afterwards, OK?

902
01:12:40,853 --> 01:12:42,561
An after-sex ciggie?

903
01:12:43,478 --> 01:12:45,269
You're being a drag, Lucas.

904
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,019
What you do doesn't bother me.

905
01:13:25,061 --> 01:13:26,936
I won't tell anyone.

906
01:13:27,353 --> 01:13:29,853
It'd be sick
if we fell out cos of it.

907
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:32,394
Stop imagining things, Lucas.

908
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:36,061
See him often?

909
01:13:39,269 --> 01:13:41,394
You realize it's not for money?

910
01:13:42,394 --> 01:13:44,311
It's a game you both play?

911
01:13:47,144 --> 01:13:49,603
I'm eating at my mum's restaurant.

912
01:13:49,769 --> 01:13:52,978
I told Quentin I'd take you along,
if you want.

913
01:13:54,103 --> 01:13:55,103
Really?

914
01:13:58,353 --> 01:14:01,353
We'll go later,
after she finishes serving.

915
01:14:05,394 --> 01:14:06,519
If you want.

916
01:14:07,144 --> 01:14:08,436
It'll be cool.

917
01:14:09,394 --> 01:14:11,353
What shall we do for now?

918
01:14:12,269 --> 01:14:13,269
Any ideas?

919
01:14:13,728 --> 01:14:16,728
Maybe you could take the time to explain

920
01:14:16,894 --> 01:14:18,394
the game with that guy.

921
01:14:18,561 --> 01:14:20,394
None of your business, jerk.

922
01:14:21,061 --> 01:14:22,686
Delivery, 9 am tomorrow.

923
01:14:22,853 --> 01:14:23,853
OK, madam.

924
01:14:23,936 --> 01:14:25,228
- 9 am.
- Yes, 9.

925
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,019
OK, off you go.

926
01:14:33,269 --> 01:14:34,811
Were you a cook here?

927
01:14:35,269 --> 01:14:36,894
I helped my mum out.

928
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:39,019
You know every dish on the menu?

929
01:14:39,186 --> 01:14:40,519
Every single one.

930
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:43,769
- Is that on the menu?
- No.

931
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:45,436
Something smells good!

932
01:14:45,603 --> 01:14:47,019
What is it, son?

933
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:49,228
He ought to try <i>kik alicha</i>.

934
01:14:49,394 --> 01:14:51,311
- Says who?
- He's a shrimp.

935
01:14:51,769 --> 01:14:52,936
Eat it all up!

936
01:14:53,644 --> 01:14:54,686
No leftovers here.

937
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:56,561
I always finish my food.

938
01:14:56,728 --> 01:14:58,519
He saw that last night.

939
01:14:58,686 --> 01:15:01,603
That's good.
Hold on, let me wipe that up.

940
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:03,769
No, let me cook in peace.

941
01:15:05,269 --> 01:15:07,353
Help her set the table, Lucas.

942
01:15:08,228 --> 01:15:09,978
That's a pretty table.

943
01:15:12,478 --> 01:15:16,228
This is for the one
who can come calling anytime.

944
01:15:17,644 --> 01:15:18,644
Tell me...

945
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,686
How's your mother?

946
01:15:21,644 --> 01:15:22,978
Is she managing?

947
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:25,269
Yes.

948
01:15:26,103 --> 01:15:28,978
I know it's hard
to lose your dad, honey,

949
01:15:29,478 --> 01:15:31,061
but losing your husband...

950
01:15:31,228 --> 01:15:33,144
You lose all your bearings.

951
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:36,686
You lose half yourself,
your lifetime companion.

952
01:15:36,853 --> 01:15:38,311
It's awful.

953
01:15:38,478 --> 01:15:40,561
She's really going to need you.

954
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:44,603
You don't need your dad,
you're big now, see?

955
01:15:46,186 --> 01:15:48,103
My husband was so handsome!

956
01:15:49,769 --> 01:15:50,769
Him...

957
01:15:51,066 --> 01:15:52,185
The same.

958
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:54,186
I think we've covered it.

959
01:15:56,228 --> 01:15:58,436
Whenever we talk about your dad...

960
01:15:58,603 --> 01:16:00,228
It's always a bad time.

961
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,436
He's the one who left, remember.

962
01:16:03,728 --> 01:16:05,769
- For a slut.
- Jesus...

963
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:08,686
- What?
- Do we need to do this now?

964
01:16:08,894 --> 01:16:11,644
- You're going to defend her?
- Not now, OK.

965
01:16:11,936 --> 01:16:13,978
OK, let's forget your father.

966
01:16:14,144 --> 01:16:15,519
Let's talk about you.

967
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:18,394
What's the situation, love-wise?

968
01:16:19,769 --> 01:16:20,936
Has Fabrice...

969
01:16:21,103 --> 01:16:22,811
It's dead calm right now.

970
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,769
Fabrice left a while ago.

971
01:16:25,978 --> 01:16:27,353
I never liked him.

972
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:28,476
Why not?

973
01:16:28,519 --> 01:16:30,228
- Too white maybe.
- Shit.

974
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:31,436
Or you, not enough.

975
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:33,561
Mum, you're embarrassing.

976
01:16:34,686 --> 01:16:36,019
Really embarrassing.

977
01:16:37,686 --> 01:16:40,894
You don't get it, you honkie.
Know what a honkie is?

978
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:42,936
- No, what?
- A white boy.

979
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:44,311
Leave him alone.

980
01:16:44,354 --> 01:16:45,361
It's true.

981
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:48,519
I've been around and I've seen stuff...

982
01:16:48,686 --> 01:16:50,978
It's not the same for others.

983
01:16:51,144 --> 01:16:52,144
No.

984
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:53,644
I know that.

985
01:16:54,353 --> 01:16:55,644
Just warning him.

986
01:16:57,103 --> 01:16:58,311
Got a girlfriend?

987
01:16:58,853 --> 01:17:01,353
Black? White? Yellow?

988
01:17:01,936 --> 01:17:04,103
You're too much. Leave him be.

989
01:17:04,269 --> 01:17:05,686
I'm just asking!

990
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:07,228
It's a touchy issue.

991
01:17:07,394 --> 01:17:08,686
No, I'm free.

992
01:17:09,269 --> 01:17:10,936
He's free!

993
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:47,561
What are you doing?

994
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:53,311
If I wait for you to make a move,
I reckon it could take forever.

995
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:58,478
Life is tough for you,
but aren't you rushing things?

996
01:18:58,644 --> 01:19:00,311
I don't wanna waste time.

997
01:19:00,686 --> 01:19:03,061
Nothing lasts, so I won't wait.

998
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:04,894
You may be wrong.

999
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:06,252
About what?

1000
01:19:06,295 --> 01:19:07,894
Me being ready for this.

1001
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:10,478
Like you're not a fag?

1002
01:19:11,186 --> 01:19:13,186
I'm a total fag, OK.

1003
01:19:13,353 --> 01:19:16,144
But you're my friend's brother.
You don't want this.

1004
01:19:17,228 --> 01:19:18,311
I want it.

1005
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:20,228
It's all I want.

1006
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:22,936
You're gonna meet other guys...

1007
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:23,981
OK, stop.

1008
01:19:24,024 --> 01:19:26,065
- I'm sure.
- Sorry I kissed you.

1009
01:19:26,186 --> 01:19:28,144
You're Quentin's kid brother.

1010
01:19:28,311 --> 01:19:29,644
I'm 29, you're 17.

1011
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,353
Shut up.
Don't lecture me, please.

1012
01:19:36,853 --> 01:19:38,144
You're wrong about me.

1013
01:19:40,769 --> 01:19:42,311
I'm just older than you.

1014
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:45,561
I know things you can't imagine.

1015
01:19:55,978 --> 01:19:57,019
Come on, Lucas.

1016
01:20:05,269 --> 01:20:06,894
Let's go for a walk.

1017
01:20:07,061 --> 01:20:08,436
No, I start early.

1018
01:21:22,853 --> 01:21:24,144
Oscar can help,

1019
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:27,103
but you can ask your teachers too.

1020
01:21:29,519 --> 01:21:32,269
They're bound to know what happened.

1021
01:21:36,853 --> 01:21:38,186
You heard me, Lucas?

1022
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,353
You'll see the other boarders again.

1023
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:44,061
With them, it can only get better.

1024
01:21:54,478 --> 01:21:56,644
It's like I spend my life here.

1025
01:21:59,978 --> 01:22:01,353
Isn't Lilio here?

1026
01:22:01,519 --> 01:22:03,561
No, like I said, I'm alone.

1027
01:22:07,186 --> 01:22:09,603
You didn't tell me what you charge.

1028
01:22:11,019 --> 01:22:13,144
- 50.
- 50 euros?

1029
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:17,853
150 euros.

1030
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,728
We do what you want.

1031
01:22:32,394 --> 01:22:33,894
I don't want anything.

1032
01:22:34,144 --> 01:22:37,019
I just want you to tell Lilio
everything.

1033
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:38,311
Lilio?

1034
01:22:38,478 --> 01:22:40,978
Yes, tell him everything we do.

1035
01:22:43,186 --> 01:22:44,186
Not so fast.

1036
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:46,019
Let me look at you.

1037
01:22:48,269 --> 01:22:49,644
Turn around.

1038
01:23:04,103 --> 01:23:06,894
No, keep the underpants on.
Nice and slow.

1039
01:23:07,936 --> 01:23:09,269
We're in no rush.

1040
01:23:24,769 --> 01:23:26,228
Is that Lilio?

1041
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:30,228
That sly devil planned it all.

1042
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:40,728
What's going on? Who are you?

1043
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:43,519
Get out of my place.

1044
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,394
Shame on you.

1045
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:50,269
What's going on? Are you nuts?

1046
01:23:50,728 --> 01:23:52,644
Come here! What's going on?

1047
01:23:53,394 --> 01:23:54,853
What's all this money?

1048
01:23:55,978 --> 01:23:57,728
Why's this money here?

1049
01:23:57,894 --> 01:23:59,353
Why is it here?

1050
01:24:01,769 --> 01:24:03,228
Why do you do this?

1051
01:24:03,561 --> 01:24:06,061
I'm fucking sick of you!
Why?

1052
01:24:06,228 --> 01:24:08,186
- Why d'you do this?
- It's a game!

1053
01:24:08,353 --> 01:24:10,978
A game? You call this a game?

1054
01:24:11,394 --> 01:24:14,061
Go on, get some clothes on.
A game?

1055
01:25:25,269 --> 01:25:26,811
I'm sending you home.

1056
01:25:28,561 --> 01:25:31,103
It was a bad idea bringing you here.

1057
01:25:31,603 --> 01:25:32,603
It's true.

1058
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:34,228
Go home and say nothing.

1059
01:25:34,394 --> 01:25:36,311
Mum doesn't need to know.

1060
01:25:37,686 --> 01:25:40,519
You need to control yourself.

1061
01:25:42,561 --> 01:25:45,436
It's sick profiting from Dad's death
that way.

1062
01:25:46,103 --> 01:25:48,936
I know, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

1063
01:25:50,853 --> 01:25:52,686
Everything's so sad now.

1064
01:25:56,686 --> 01:25:58,478
Your grief can't wreck it all.

1065
01:25:59,978 --> 01:26:02,478
You have to think of me and of Mum.

1066
01:26:04,353 --> 01:26:05,769
We're not animals.

1067
01:26:07,769 --> 01:26:09,103
We hurt like you do.

1068
01:26:13,728 --> 01:26:15,186
Keep me here.

1069
01:26:15,644 --> 01:26:17,644
Keep me here with you, please.

1070
01:26:19,103 --> 01:26:20,978
No, you'll be at home tonight.

1071
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:33,311
<i>This is where I am now.</i>

1072
01:26:34,394 --> 01:26:38,519
<i>Maybe I skipped stuff,
but I couldn't take two more weeks.</i>

1073
01:26:41,144 --> 01:26:42,811
<i>I miss you, Dad.</i>

1074
01:26:43,228 --> 01:26:44,686
<i>I need you.</i>

1075
01:26:45,394 --> 01:26:46,728
<i>Hear what I say.</i>

1076
01:26:47,353 --> 01:26:51,228
<i>Everything seems too clear
since you died.</i>

1077
01:26:53,228 --> 01:26:56,311
<i>I feel I know
our exact place in the world.</i>

1078
01:26:56,728 --> 01:26:58,728
<i>And that place, Dad,</i>

1079
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:01,978
<i>is worth nothing.</i>

1080
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:15,561
We can talk, if you want.

1081
01:27:18,769 --> 01:27:20,436
You can tell me anything.

1082
01:27:25,019 --> 01:27:27,103
Tell me what happened in Paris.

1083
01:27:27,269 --> 01:27:28,644
It could help us.

1084
01:27:33,644 --> 01:27:34,811
I wonder...

1085
01:27:34,978 --> 01:27:37,186
What? What do you wonder?

1086
01:27:38,394 --> 01:27:40,686
I wonder if I should worry or not.

1087
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:44,103
You're real pains, your brother and you.

1088
01:27:44,978 --> 01:27:46,936
I don't want secrets between us.

1089
01:27:47,478 --> 01:27:49,061
Don't you have secrets?

1090
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:54,894
What are you implying?

1091
01:27:57,353 --> 01:27:58,478
Nothing.

1092
01:28:00,019 --> 01:28:02,144
If you have a question, ask it.

1093
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:04,103
What's on your mind?

1094
01:28:04,769 --> 01:28:05,936
Tell me.

1095
01:28:07,269 --> 01:28:09,519
Could Dad have done it on purpose?

1096
01:28:12,144 --> 01:28:13,144
What?

1097
01:28:15,936 --> 01:28:19,269
Losing control of his car
on a straight road,

1098
01:28:19,603 --> 01:28:22,686
with a truck opposite,
maybe he wanted it.

1099
01:28:33,394 --> 01:28:35,728
You drive the last few kilometres.

1100
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:39,228
Supervised driving
means you need to drive.

1101
01:28:51,644 --> 01:28:53,436
<i>It's the story of my shame...</i>

1102
01:28:54,936 --> 01:28:57,103
<i>that settled inside my mind,</i>

1103
01:28:57,269 --> 01:28:59,061
<i>destroyed everything</i>

1104
01:28:59,394 --> 01:29:01,061
<i>and began to rule.</i>

1105
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:08,269
<i>It rots my head and my heart.</i>

1106
01:29:10,686 --> 01:29:13,394
<i>I speak as a judge, knowing I'm guilty.</i>

1107
01:29:14,811 --> 01:29:16,394
<i>You see me fall.</i>

1108
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:21,561
<i>You can't deny, Dad,
you didn't see where I was heading.</i>

1109
01:29:23,853 --> 01:29:25,686
<i>I feel inexcusable.</i>

1110
01:29:26,519 --> 01:29:28,853
<i>I confused the best with the worst.</i>

1111
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:34,561
<i>I thought, with your death,
the world was telling me the truth.</i>

1112
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:37,186
<i>But it didn't.</i>

1113
01:29:37,936 --> 01:29:40,436
<i>There's no more truth now than before.</i>

1114
01:29:41,561 --> 01:29:43,436
No one tells the truth.

1115
01:29:49,644 --> 01:29:51,144
We have to stay silent.

1116
01:29:51,603 --> 01:29:53,061
I'll stay silent.

1117
01:29:55,019 --> 01:29:57,186
Until I'm told the truth,

1118
01:29:57,478 --> 01:29:59,228
my mouth will stay shut.

1119
01:30:01,728 --> 01:30:03,603
<i>I'm stepping into silence.</i>

1120
01:30:04,894 --> 01:30:06,603
<i>I swear to God.</i>

1121
01:30:27,269 --> 01:30:28,561
Come on.

1122
01:30:28,978 --> 01:30:30,686
What are you up to?

1123
01:30:32,728 --> 01:30:34,603
The vice-principal is waiting.

1124
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:43,269
I'll leave your bag here.

1125
01:31:47,394 --> 01:31:50,394
Let's go. Fold up the sides.

1126
01:31:52,769 --> 01:31:54,394
Hang on there, Lucas.

1127
01:31:55,936 --> 01:31:56,936
Stay with us.

1128
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:08,478
I'll call you.
Don't worry, I'll call you.

1129
01:32:13,144 --> 01:32:14,769
You can go with him.

1130
01:32:15,228 --> 01:32:16,394
Climb in, madam.

1131
01:32:18,269 --> 01:32:20,436
You're in an ambulance now.

1132
01:32:21,561 --> 01:32:22,728
We're good.

1133
01:32:22,894 --> 01:32:24,269
I'm closing the door.

1134
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:31,103
It's so hot.

1135
01:32:33,936 --> 01:32:35,186
Can't we do anything?

1136
01:32:35,353 --> 01:32:36,728
No, sorry.

1137
01:32:38,186 --> 01:32:40,603
It seems to be jammed.

1138
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,478
Can you manage?

1139
01:32:51,978 --> 01:32:52,978
Well?

1140
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:55,394
Hold on, what are you doing?

1141
01:32:58,644 --> 01:33:00,436
You need to leave soon.

1142
01:33:03,478 --> 01:33:04,978
A couple more minutes.

1143
01:33:05,228 --> 01:33:07,478
Let's do it gently.

1144
01:33:12,103 --> 01:33:13,603
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1145
01:33:17,478 --> 01:33:19,436
It's not easy to leave.

1146
01:33:21,144 --> 01:33:22,853
But two weeks

1147
01:33:23,394 --> 01:33:25,936
without a visit
isn't that long, sweetheart.

1148
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,478
You'll be able to rest here.

1149
01:33:34,978 --> 01:33:38,311
We can write to you,
so I'll do it every day, promise.

1150
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:41,478
But maybe

1151
01:33:41,769 --> 01:33:43,436
you'll get mail once a week.

1152
01:33:43,603 --> 01:33:44,811
The doctor decides.

1153
01:33:45,269 --> 01:33:46,394
All right.

1154
01:33:46,978 --> 01:33:49,269
Don't worry if you can't reply.

1155
01:33:50,769 --> 01:33:53,853
The pyjamas are just
for a day or two, they said.

1156
01:33:54,603 --> 01:33:56,436
Remember what they told you.

1157
01:33:57,061 --> 01:34:00,061
You can borrow books from the library.

1158
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,103
I can't hang around.

1159
01:34:03,269 --> 01:34:05,853
I shouldn't even be in your room.

1160
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,478
If it's clear for you, I'll go.

1161
01:34:11,644 --> 01:34:14,311
You're not locked in here,
you know that?

1162
01:34:15,894 --> 01:34:17,394
You can leave

1163
01:34:17,978 --> 01:34:21,103
as soon as you feel better, all right?

1164
01:34:22,936 --> 01:34:26,603
You decide, the doctor said.
It's a "voluntary" hospitalization.

1165
01:34:34,644 --> 01:34:35,894
See you soon.

1166
01:34:39,519 --> 01:34:40,686
I love you.

1167
01:34:40,853 --> 01:34:42,353
Quentin loves you.

1168
01:34:42,519 --> 01:34:44,478
You'll make it, sweetheart.

1169
01:34:45,644 --> 01:34:46,644
Goodbye.

1170
01:35:28,978 --> 01:35:31,936
The two of us can play a quick game
one day.

1171
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:36,603
Besides, I bet you'll win.

1172
01:35:43,186 --> 01:35:44,186
All right...

1173
01:35:45,853 --> 01:35:48,394
Let's do the guided tour.

1174
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:49,728
OK, Lucas?

1175
01:35:50,603 --> 01:35:53,311
You have a church to your right.

1176
01:35:53,686 --> 01:35:55,436
We'll go there later.

1177
01:37:56,228 --> 01:37:57,936
Ready to order?

1178
01:37:58,103 --> 01:38:00,228
We can choose dessert today?

1179
01:38:00,394 --> 01:38:01,519
Yes, for Christmas.

1180
01:38:03,519 --> 01:38:05,686
What do you fancy, boys?

1181
01:38:06,353 --> 01:38:08,686
I'll go for the Black Forest cake.

1182
01:38:10,228 --> 01:38:12,186
Chocolate sundae for Lucas.

1183
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:13,978
And you, Quentin?

1184
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:16,394
Nothing for me.

1185
01:38:16,561 --> 01:38:17,728
Just coffee.

1186
01:38:17,894 --> 01:38:19,061
For my sake,

1187
01:38:19,228 --> 01:38:20,311
have a dessert.

1188
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:22,394
So I have no choice.

1189
01:38:22,561 --> 01:38:24,019
Chocolate sundae then.

1190
01:38:25,394 --> 01:38:26,728
Thank you.

1191
01:38:32,853 --> 01:38:34,061
What is it?

1192
01:38:34,228 --> 01:38:35,811
A new exhibition.

1193
01:38:36,228 --> 01:38:37,228
Ibexes...

1194
01:38:39,436 --> 01:38:42,686
They're pretty. Beautiful.
A fine animal.

1195
01:38:42,853 --> 01:38:45,103
Maybe you could offer

1196
01:38:45,769 --> 01:38:48,353
to exhibit your stuff,
to make a change.

1197
01:38:48,519 --> 01:38:49,519
Seriously?

1198
01:38:49,894 --> 01:38:51,853
You have to show your work.

1199
01:38:52,019 --> 01:38:55,228
As if my goal in life has always been

1200
01:38:55,436 --> 01:38:58,519
a show at the Chambéry hospital eatery.

1201
01:39:12,644 --> 01:39:14,228
You're disgusting!

1202
01:39:18,644 --> 01:39:21,603
He'd finished, so I gave him a bit more.

1203
01:41:12,478 --> 01:41:15,269
<i>Inefficiency, immobility.</i>

1204
01:41:15,436 --> 01:41:17,811
<i>One example,
shutting down Fessenheim</i>

1205
01:41:17,978 --> 01:41:19,936
<i>to buy electricity</i>

1206
01:41:20,103 --> 01:41:22,144
<i>from coal-powered plants outside France.</i>

1207
01:41:22,311 --> 01:41:24,228
<i>It's one huge symbol.</i>

1208
01:41:24,686 --> 01:41:27,853
<i>The government is forcing the country</i>

1209
01:41:28,019 --> 01:41:30,478
<i>to move from the 21st century</i>

1210
01:41:30,644 --> 01:41:32,436
<i>to the 19th one.</i>

1211
01:41:33,478 --> 01:41:35,061
<i>It's an attack on the climate</i>

1212
01:41:35,228 --> 01:41:37,311
<i>and on national sovereignty.</i>

1213
01:41:38,061 --> 01:41:39,644
<i>And, above all,</i>

1214
01:41:39,811 --> 01:41:42,603
<i>an attack on future generations.</i>

1215
01:44:50,978 --> 01:44:53,311
FAMILY ROOM 3

1216
01:44:55,144 --> 01:44:56,353
See you later.

1217
01:45:00,853 --> 01:45:02,478
His tea is boiling hot.

1218
01:45:08,728 --> 01:45:10,811
Not talking can be handy.

1219
01:45:14,269 --> 01:45:16,478
It forces others to do it for you.

1220
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:20,769
I know the technique, I've used it too.

1221
01:45:23,644 --> 01:45:26,019
My train leaves at 5:30 pm.

1222
01:45:26,769 --> 01:45:29,144
It's fine by me if we don't talk.

1223
01:45:31,061 --> 01:45:33,019
It's OK if you have nothing to say.

1224
01:45:34,311 --> 01:45:38,686
No one asked me to come.
I came because I felt I ought to.

1225
01:45:39,394 --> 01:45:41,353
Because I wanted to see you.

1226
01:45:42,561 --> 01:45:44,269
To see how you were doing.

1227
01:45:47,144 --> 01:45:49,728
It's hard talking to Quentin about you.

1228
01:45:52,436 --> 01:45:56,061
He seems stressed somehow.
It isn't easy.

1229
01:45:57,728 --> 01:46:01,019
Besides, I wouldn't want to betray you

1230
01:46:01,894 --> 01:46:04,186
by saying something I shouldn't.

1231
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:11,603
I don't know if I'm partly responsible
for what you did,

1232
01:46:11,769 --> 01:46:14,728
but know I've never thought ill of you.

1233
01:46:16,144 --> 01:46:18,061
Nor wanted you hurt.

1234
01:46:19,728 --> 01:46:21,811
I think of you every day now.

1235
01:46:23,978 --> 01:46:26,644
Maybe not the way you'd like but...

1236
01:46:46,353 --> 01:46:49,269
Maybe I'm younger than you,
like you said,

1237
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:51,728
but I get exhausted too sometimes.

1238
01:46:55,353 --> 01:46:58,894
Some mornings, I don't know
how I'll make it to evening.

1239
01:47:01,061 --> 01:47:02,769
It's a daily battle.

1240
01:47:03,853 --> 01:47:05,853
Everything crashes into me.

1241
01:47:06,269 --> 01:47:08,144
And it never ends.

1242
01:47:31,603 --> 01:47:32,603
Thank you.

1243
01:47:33,894 --> 01:47:35,394
You'll be back by 6 pm?

1244
01:47:36,269 --> 01:47:37,311
All right.

1245
01:47:38,394 --> 01:47:40,436
- Have a nice walk.
- Thank you.

1246
01:48:27,228 --> 01:48:28,519
Let's go this way.

1247
01:48:36,936 --> 01:48:38,353
What is it?

1248
01:49:35,269 --> 01:49:36,686
Where were you?

1249
01:49:36,853 --> 01:49:38,228
You're soaked.

1250
01:49:38,603 --> 01:49:40,019
You went for a run?

1251
01:49:40,228 --> 01:49:43,019
You went into town?
You went out?

1252
01:49:43,186 --> 01:49:46,769
I'm not saying you can't,
but did you let them know?

1253
01:49:47,061 --> 01:49:49,144
I've brought your clean laundry.

1254
01:49:56,561 --> 01:49:59,936
I didn't know you ran
outside the grounds.

1255
01:50:01,019 --> 01:50:02,228
What is it?

1256
01:50:05,644 --> 01:50:08,353
I saw Lilio to the station, that's why.

1257
01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:10,894
When did you start speaking?

1258
01:50:15,311 --> 01:50:17,436
Now. Just now, with you.

1259
01:50:39,394 --> 01:50:41,894
You know, Mum, I think

1260
01:50:42,061 --> 01:50:45,519
it's time we saw Fortineau
to tell him I can leave.

1261
01:50:59,436 --> 01:51:01,061
I'll be right there.

1262
01:51:07,853 --> 01:51:10,894
It's silly to think
you had anything to do with it.

1263
01:51:12,103 --> 01:51:16,144
It's silly to think
you're watching over your son.

1264
01:51:17,811 --> 01:51:19,686
That you're his ally

1265
01:51:19,853 --> 01:51:24,478
and can bring him back to life
by giving him some of your strength.

1266
01:51:26,019 --> 01:51:29,269
It's silly, but it's so good
to believe it tonight.

1267
01:51:31,978 --> 01:51:36,519
<i>The beauty of it warms me
for the first time since you went away.</i>

1268
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:18,394
<i>For the first time,
my heart feels less cold</i>

1269
01:52:19,811 --> 01:52:22,103
<i>and your absence less awful.</i>

1270
01:52:23,019 --> 01:52:24,894
<i>I know you're with me.</i>

1271
01:52:25,311 --> 01:52:26,686
<i>You're here.</i>

1272
01:52:28,811 --> 01:52:32,478
<i>And even though, my love,
you won't be in our bed,</i>

1273
01:52:33,186 --> 01:52:36,394
<i>even though I'll nestle
against emptiness again,</i>

1274
01:52:38,061 --> 01:52:41,186
<i>listen to what I'm going to tell you.</i>

1275
01:52:43,061 --> 01:52:46,936
<i>For the first time, I'll fall asleep
without being angry at you.</i>

1276
01:52:49,936 --> 01:52:51,686
I'm not mad at you anymore.

1277
01:52:53,769 --> 01:52:55,186
I miss you.

1278
01:53:13,519 --> 01:53:16,186
<i>I'm not as strong as you thought.</i>

1279
01:53:16,353 --> 01:53:17,769
<i>Forgive me.</i>

1280
01:53:19,519 --> 01:53:22,603
<i>Do I have the right
to be so happy without you?</i>

1281
01:53:23,936 --> 01:53:27,894
<i>How will I manage the years
if I can't share them with you?</i>

1282
01:53:32,686 --> 01:53:34,769
<i>Be with me, my love.</i>

1283
01:53:35,769 --> 01:53:37,561
<i>Never leave me.</i>

1284
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:57,103
You're back? Forgot something?

1285
01:53:57,269 --> 01:53:58,269
Yes.

1286
01:53:58,686 --> 01:54:00,061
See you tomorrow.

1287
01:54:01,644 --> 01:54:04,811
I left the ball out.
Could you put it away?

1288
01:54:04,978 --> 01:54:06,353
Yes, I'll see to it.

1289
01:54:33,936 --> 01:54:36,769
Yes, Mum, I knew Lilio was coming down.

1290
01:54:37,811 --> 01:54:40,269
A quick round-trip.
He just got back.

1291
01:54:41,853 --> 01:54:43,644
What? Lucas spoke to you?

1292
01:54:46,103 --> 01:54:47,436
Hold on a second...

1293
01:54:48,936 --> 01:54:49,978
What?

1294
01:54:51,019 --> 01:54:52,644
What are you saying?

1295
01:54:54,519 --> 01:54:55,769
He really spoke?

1296
01:54:56,394 --> 01:54:58,936
First, Lucas told me about Lilio,

1297
01:54:59,103 --> 01:55:03,061
then said we should see Fortineau
to ask to be discharged.

1298
01:55:06,894 --> 01:55:09,519
No, we didn't, it was too late.

1299
01:55:11,978 --> 01:55:15,103
I said I'd call the secretary tomorrow.

1300
01:55:16,811 --> 01:55:20,103
<i>But your brother was very calm
when he said it.</i>

1301
01:55:20,269 --> 01:55:21,769
<i>Very sure of himself.</i>

1302
01:55:22,311 --> 01:55:24,728
I think we can trust him.

1303
01:55:25,269 --> 01:55:26,978
Of course we can.

1304
01:55:27,144 --> 01:55:28,436
It's his decision.

1305
01:55:29,228 --> 01:55:31,728
Let me know after you see the doctor.

1306
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:35,519
Want me to come down
to go with you?

1307
01:55:37,603 --> 01:55:40,478
Let me know when you get an appointment.

1308
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:44,769
He's going to make it, Mum.

1309
01:55:46,311 --> 01:55:48,978
I know, but even if we're scared,

1310
01:55:49,144 --> 01:55:51,228
we mustn't show it, OK?

1311
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:55,561
Can you give me Lilio's number, please?

1312
01:55:56,644 --> 01:55:58,228
No, I won't call him.

1313
01:55:58,394 --> 01:56:02,353
Your brother did a video on my phone
and asked me to send it to him.

1314
01:56:02,686 --> 01:56:05,019
Yes, text it to me.

1315
01:56:05,519 --> 01:56:07,144
Love you, darling.

1316
01:56:37,103 --> 01:56:39,186
<i>You haven't hurt yourself</i>

1317
01:56:40,353 --> 01:56:42,853
<i>Just as I thought</i>

1318
01:56:46,519 --> 01:56:48,936
<i>You see, it's no use at all</i>

1319
01:56:49,894 --> 01:56:52,394
<i>Sheltering from the wind</i>

1320
01:56:56,144 --> 01:56:58,769
<i>We are just seashells</i>

1321
01:56:59,394 --> 01:57:00,936
<i>Scattered over the sand</i>

1322
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:08,186
<i>With no chance of return</i>

1323
01:57:08,811 --> 01:57:11,353
<i>To when the sea was calm</i>

1324
01:57:24,311 --> 01:57:26,311
<i>You were a little scared</i>

1325
01:57:27,603 --> 01:57:30,103
<i>Just as I thought</i>

1326
01:57:33,811 --> 01:57:36,311
<i>You see, it's no use at all</i>

1327
01:57:37,478 --> 01:57:40,186
<i>Withdrawing into yourself</i>

1328
01:57:43,644 --> 01:57:46,311
<i>We are just seashells</i>

1329
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:49,561
<i>Scattered over the sand</i>

1330
01:57:53,478 --> 01:57:55,186
<i>With no chance of return</i>

1331
01:57:56,686 --> 01:57:59,436
<i>To when the sea was calm</i>

1332
01:58:05,394 --> 01:58:07,269
<i>Not anymore</i>

1333
01:58:41,228 --> 01:58:42,561
Yes, I'm done.

1334
01:58:50,519 --> 01:58:53,644
TO MY FATHER
