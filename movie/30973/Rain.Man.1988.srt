1
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:28,179
A J&H Entertainment
Release

2
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,179
How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?

3
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:14,552
Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.

4
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:17,024
Three times?
You're on a roll.

5
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,652
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.

6
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:22,288
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

7
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:24,628
I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...

8
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:27,863
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.

9
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:30,449
Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.

10
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,541
Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.

11
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,051
I'll explain that
to my swing loan.

12
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:38,022
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.

13
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:41,889
I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.

14
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,361
- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.

15
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:48,058
I got a shark snappin' at my heels.

16
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:50,624
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

17
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:53,136
I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.

18
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:55,672
I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.

19
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:58,868
This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...

20
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:02,778
and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my four cars off the road?

21
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:05,213
Babbitt Collectibles.

22
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:08,080
Have you tried cash?
How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?

23
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,120
Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.

24
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,348
- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing Loan.

25
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:15,950
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.

26
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,358
- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.

27
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,265
Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.

28
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,462
I need this.
Come on.

29
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:29,471
I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.

30
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,974
His number?
He's on the road now.

31
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:34,271
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--

32
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:37,074
Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:30 a.m.

33
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:39,614
- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.

34
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,674
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

35
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:46,552
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

36
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,750
Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...

37
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,884
and the E.P.A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.

38
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:54,953
- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm Listening.

39
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:58,591
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.

40
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:02,034
- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.

41
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:06,531
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Line.

42
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:09,975
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--

43
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,569
What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.

44
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,175
We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

45
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:19,185
And because of your
incredible patience...

46
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:23,815
we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.

47
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,485
Well, yes,
you've been most patient.

48
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:30,496
We really appreciate your patience.
Well, thank you.

49
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,555
Thank you.

50
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,435
Ready for Palm Springs?

51
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,699
You still want to go
with all these problems?

52
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,832
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

53
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:44,877
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- No, not bad at all.

54
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,879
- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.

55
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,881
I got it under control.

56
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,171
I don't want to be demanding...

57
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:20,108
but could you possibly say 10 or
12 words before we get to the hotel?

58
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,704
Consider it foreplay.

59
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:26,147
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

60
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:30,318
I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.

61
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:34,256
Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.

62
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:37,123
If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.

63
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:39,459
What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?

64
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:44,432
I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.

65
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,767
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?

66
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:52,434
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

67
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:55,740
One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?

68
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,077
I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.

69
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:02,141
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.

70
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:05,312
But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--

71
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,185
You wanna talk?
Let's talk!

72
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:11,556
This is not talking.

73
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,563
- Yeah?
- Charlie, this is Lenny.

74
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:17,326
I've been trying to contact you
for a while.

75
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:21,096
I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.

76
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:23,900
He's been trying to reach you.

77
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,463
Your father has died, Charlie.

78
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:32,877
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.

79
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:35,939
- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.

80
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,076
Anything else?

81
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:41,350
- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.

82
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:47,759
- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?

83
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,662
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a Long time ago.

84
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:54,793
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

85
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:58,133
We just didn't get along.

86
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,572
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:05,305
- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.

88
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:06,937
I want to.

89
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:10,744
All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to.

90
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,427
...to our beloved neighbor...

91
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:33,302
for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...

92
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:36,830
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

93
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,709
Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for Life...

94
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,249
dedication to family...

95
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:47,410
and charity to all.

96
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,285
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection Life...

97
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:55,725
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.

98
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,462
Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.

99
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:11,201
I can wait in the car.

100
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:51,748
Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.

101
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:55,754
Knew this car my whole Life.
Only drove it once.

102
00:09:55,754 --> 00:10:00,259
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.

103
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,795
Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.

104
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:07,299
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

105
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,835
Know it by rote.

106
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:27,352
You were his only child.

107
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,854
You came along when he was...

108
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,584
what, 45 or something?

109
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:35,456
He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...

110
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,825
so he had to love you.

111
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:41,798
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.

112
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:45,734
In these pictures here, he doesn't look
Like a man who doesn't love his son.

113
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:49,136
What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.

114
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:51,299
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.

115
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,038
You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.

116
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:58,241
- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.

117
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,409
'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'

118
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,783
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...

119
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:06,550
I bring home a report card,
and it's almost all A's.

120
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,217
I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'

121
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:12,785
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

122
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:16,822
He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

123
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:20,802
You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?

124
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:23,566
Because l--
I deserved it.

125
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:27,007
Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?

126
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,840
We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.

127
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,346
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

128
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:34,849
Pulled over.

129
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:38,648
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

130
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:42,213
Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.

131
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:46,352
Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'

132
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:49,022
Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.

133
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:52,124
- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?

134
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:54,634
Two days.

135
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,536
Were you scared?

136
00:11:57,536 --> 00:12:00,073
Yeah, I was scared.

137
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,177
Left home.
I never saw him again.

138
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:05,940
Charlie, after a year
we've been together...

139
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,447
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

140
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:10,211
It's strange, huh?

141
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:14,220
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

142
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,123
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

143
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,593
The rain what?

144
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:26,326
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

145
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:29,836
- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.

146
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,965
Not so much.

147
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:37,008
'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...

148
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:39,945
so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.

149
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:42,072
So full of yourself.

150
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:44,616
And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...

151
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:46,811
is understandable as well.

152
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:50,845
Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...

153
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,551
all these I forgive.

154
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:55,855
But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my Life in any way...

155
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:58,659
has left me without a son.

156
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:02,690
I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.'

157
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,773
'l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...

158
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,778
that certain Buick convertible...

159
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:18,680
the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

160
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,879
Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.

161
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,888
May they remind him
of the value of excellence...

162
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,390
and the possibility of perfection.

163
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,291
As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...

164
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,524
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...

165
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,761
that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'

166
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,529
What does that mean?

167
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:42,197
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...

168
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:46,937
after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...

169
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:49,570
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

170
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,615
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

171
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:56,083
- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.

172
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,316
What is that?
How does that work?

173
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,256
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.

174
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:05,226
I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.

175
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:08,229
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?

176
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,458
What's his name got--

177
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,558
- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.

178
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:15,502
He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.

179
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,562
I definitely got
the rose bushes.

180
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,336
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.

181
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:23,207
- There's no need--
- To what?

182
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:25,473
To be upset?

183
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,913
To be upset?

184
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:30,645
If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...

185
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:34,984
and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.

186
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:37,820
Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?

187
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,259
- Were you Listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.

188
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,593
Were you?

189
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:47,692
No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

190
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:54,166
I was looking for you.

191
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,175
How did it go?

192
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,712
I got what I expected.

193
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:17,455
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.

194
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:37,377
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.

195
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:41,886
I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.

196
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:44,148
- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.

197
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,333
Is this Wallbrook?

198
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,335
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?

199
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,496
Excuse me.

200
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:09,506
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

201
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:11,514
Would you Like
to wait in his office?

202
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:14,016
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.

203
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,366
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.

204
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,349
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.

205
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:54,049
Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.

206
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:58,991
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?

207
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,325
- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.

208
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:03,887
I'd Like to watch
the TV, please.

209
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:07,957
For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?

210
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,799
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.

211
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,270
Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.

212
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,274
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

213
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:18,005
In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

214
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:47,136
Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.

215
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,641
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

216
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,142
I knew your father
since you were two years old.

217
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:53,872
The year my mother died.

218
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,178
I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.

219
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:59,843
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.

220
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:04,184
I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.

221
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,349
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?

222
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:09,656
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...

223
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,219
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

224
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:15,562
And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.

225
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,501
I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...

226
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:20,504
help me understand
the right in what he's done.

227
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:23,665
Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...

228
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:26,505
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

229
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,079
I'm sorry,
this is not your car.

230
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,638
Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.

231
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:34,617
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?

232
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:38,621
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

233
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:42,146
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.

234
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,817
Of course, today's Monday.

235
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,830
I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.

236
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,525
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

237
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,033
- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.

238
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:55,936
Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.

239
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,702
Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.

240
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:02,233
- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.

241
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,609
Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.

242
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,148
Now they're pitiful red.

243
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,651
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

244
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:13,447
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

245
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,484
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.

246
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:21,724
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

247
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:24,265
Only 8,095 production models.

248
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,858
Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.

249
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,870
- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?

250
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,371
- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?

251
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,035
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

252
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:38,203
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!

253
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:40,270
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

254
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,806
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.

255
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:47,548
Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?

256
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:50,182
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'

257
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:52,317
I wanna ask you a question.

258
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,998
What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--

259
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:57,933
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.

260
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,231
Bruner, who is this guy?

261
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,568
Raymond is your brother.

262
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,474
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

263
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:10,206
...and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:

264
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:13,181
'The People's Court.'

265
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,740
'The People's Court.'

266
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:21,953
'The People's Court.'

267
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:27,259
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'

268
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,264
- What is he, crazy?
- No.

269
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,798
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

270
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,098
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

271
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,104
I don't know what that means.

272
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,662
People Like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'

273
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:41,608
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

274
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,872
- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.

275
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:47,472
- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?

276
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:50,780
It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...

277
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,843
and how it's processed.

278
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:55,355
English here.
You're talkin' over my head.

279
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,720
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

280
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,727
He can't even express himself
or probably even...

281
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,059
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

282
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:09,962
And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.

283
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:12,563
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

284
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,575
Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.

285
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,043
Rituals. That's a good one.

286
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,876
Well, it's the way he acts...

287
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:24,883
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.

288
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,944
- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How Long has he been here?

289
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:32,389
- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?

290
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:35,052
He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.

291
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,824
- You've been here that Long?
- That's when I started.

292
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:41,627
So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.

293
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:44,693
You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.

294
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:48,605
- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?

295
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:52,075
- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?

296
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,307
I don't know.

297
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,644
Does he know how much money
he's been left?

298
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,880
No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

299
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,719
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

300
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:10,057
He's just inherited $3 million...

301
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:12,960
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

302
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,297
Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?

303
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,497
Good ol' Dad.

304
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:24,608
What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

305
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:27,906
Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?

306
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,970
Why is he doin' that?

307
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,073
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'

308
00:22:33,073 --> 00:22:35,083
- Yeah, why?
- Why?

309
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,984
It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.

310
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:42,549
- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.

311
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:45,060
- Ted Kloszevski.
- Kluszewski.

312
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,756
Ted Kluszewski. 'Big Klu.'
First base.

313
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:50,424
- He played for Cincinnati.
- Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.

314
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:54,595
- Lifetime batting average, .298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?

315
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:57,572
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

316
00:22:59,942 --> 00:23:03,969
Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people
are gonna be here all day, Vern.

317
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:06,446
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

318
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:10,281
-This is definitely not a weekend visit.
-He's gettin' anxious.

319
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:13,515
- It's okay, Ray.
- Vern.

320
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:16,422
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

321
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:19,119
- He said not to touch the books!
- Not to touch books.

322
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,388
- You Like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

323
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:23,760
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?

324
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,232
- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.

325
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,293
- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?

326
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:30,599
- Stop it!
- Yes.

327
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,405
You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?

328
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:37,501
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

329
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,704
Maybe you'd better put it back.

330
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:44,745
You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.

331
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:47,083
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

332
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,248
It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.

333
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:53,623
Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.

334
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:56,094
It's okay, Ray.

335
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,154
- My main man.
- My main man.

336
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:03,361
Here are your cards. I didn't know
where you wanted me to put them.

337
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:07,270
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

338
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,310
That's his way of showing he likes you.

339
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,211
But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.

340
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:18,444
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.

341
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:23,045
I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.

342
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:27,525
If I left town tomorrow and
didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.

343
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:29,527
He wouldn't notice?

344
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:33,361
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

345
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:36,264
Ray, you wanna go take a walk?

346
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,365
Can he hear us
when he's Like that?

347
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,671
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

348
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:48,144
There's 27 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

349
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:50,840
Don't worry.
We'll bring you right back.

350
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,679
Practically 26 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

351
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,720
- We'll bring him right back.
- Twenty-six minutes.

352
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,119
I won't do it.

353
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,093
First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--

354
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:08,655
You're upset. Raymond,
I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.

355
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:12,498
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

356
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:15,765
No. Just stay there.

357
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:23,108
Just stay there.
Just stand still, okay? That's good.

358
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:27,014
I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do--

359
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:28,916
What?

360
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,715
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there...

361
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:35,120
and wait for you again
at the gate?

362
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,523
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

363
00:25:37,523 --> 00:25:39,527
The car disturbs him.

364
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:42,722
- That's why?
- That's why.

365
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,098
Okay, Raymond.

366
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:58,542
What are you lookin' at?
The ducks are over here.

367
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,376
I don't know.

368
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:07,011
Listen, our father died last week.

369
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:09,079
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

370
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,854
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

371
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:16,997
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

372
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:20,431
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.

373
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:23,868
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.

374
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:31,668
I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.

375
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:36,078
- Go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.

376
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:38,640
- We don't have to go today.
- Monday, no games scheduled.

377
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,121
I just thought maybe you'd Like
to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

378
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:46,283
He pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.

379
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,793
- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

380
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:51,330
- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.

381
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,126
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

382
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,360
Come on, Ray.

383
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:59,833
It's a Long way
to California...

384
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:03,636
and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.

385
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:06,234
Have to be back in two hours.

386
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:10,111
The people, crowds cheering.
You'll love it.

387
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,173
- This is the presidential suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

388
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:54,713
Here is Raymond's room.

389
00:28:54,713 --> 00:28:58,615
- Look at this beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.

390
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:01,620
- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.

391
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,851
Little guy! This is gonna be terrific.
We're brothers.

392
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:08,952
- Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.
- When did he say--

393
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:12,795
I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have that for dessert.

394
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:15,459
We can do that.
I'm gonna call Lenny.

395
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:18,368
This is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.

396
00:29:18,368 --> 00:29:21,668
- The bed's in the wrong place.
- You can move it.

397
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:25,142
- Where do you want the bed?
- Should be near the window.

398
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:29,204
Of course, I don't have my books.
Of course, there's no bookshelves.

399
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:32,306
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be book-less.

400
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:36,286
Here's a book, a big telephone book.
A lot of words.

401
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:38,322
Pick up, Lenny.

402
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:42,827
I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,
and he doesn't answer the phone.

403
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,692
- 6:00 here means it's 9:00 there.
- It's 3:00 there.

404
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:47,026
6:30 p.m. is dinner.

405
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:50,033
It's 3:00 there.
He doesn't wanna answer the phone?

406
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,035
Orange soda.

407
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:55,162
Has to be in a can with a straw.

408
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:58,607
Bruner told you
that you should do this?

409
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:01,110
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.

410
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,522
V-E-R-N!

411
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:27,036
Oh, God.
Go see what he's doin'.

412
00:30:27,937 --> 00:30:30,633
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!

413
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,971
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

414
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:36,307
Everything is fine.
Charlie, let's take him home.

415
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:39,472
He's okay.
Just get him some dinner.

416
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:41,539
Did you say you wanted hamburger?

417
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,675
Hamburger, Ray?

418
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,381
- We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.
- Pizza?

419
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,187
- You get pizza in the institution?
- Monday night's Italian night.

420
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:54,626
- Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu.

421
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:59,099
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- I've got a bit of a legal problem.

422
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,863
He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.

423
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:04,302
All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.

424
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:13,346
- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. We're allowed.

425
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,783
'Wheel of Fortune'!

426
00:31:18,783 --> 00:31:22,812
Look at this studio filled with
glamorous merchandise...

427
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:25,357
fabulous and exciting
bonus prizes.

428
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:29,863
A pair of cars for today's busy couple.

429
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:32,955
Thousands of dollars in cash.

430
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:38,436
Over $150,000
just waiting to be won...

431
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:42,032
as we present
our big bonanza of cash...

432
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:45,942
on 'Wheel Of Fortune'!

433
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:50,380
I'd Like to order a large pizza.
Pepperoni, right?

434
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,814
I don't want pepperoni.

435
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:55,980
Yeah, a large pepperoni.
How Long is that gonna take?

436
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,888
Bring some beer up and orange soda.
You got tapioca pudding?

437
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:03,223
- No, sir, we don't.
- Just bring the closest thing.

438
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,664
Ray, take this.
Food is coming shortly.

439
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:10,725
I'll be right back.

440
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:18,001
Of course, I'm gonna be here
for a Long time, a very Long time.

441
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:21,368
I'm gone for good,
gone for good from my home.

442
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:33,196
- Si! Si!
- Si.

443
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:54,580
What is that?

444
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,491
I think Raymond is in the room.

445
00:33:57,491 --> 00:34:00,189
- Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie Babbitt.

446
00:34:00,189 --> 00:34:03,528
Well, get out!
Get out!

447
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:05,534
- Go!
- Stop it.

448
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:11,639
- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.

449
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,175
- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?

450
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:17,701
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.

451
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:19,714
Go in there.

452
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:27,589
Raymond, what were you doin' in my room?
What were you doin' in my room?

453
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:30,056
- I don't know.
- You don't know what you were doin'?

454
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:33,458
-Of course, there were noises.
-Those noises are none of your business.

455
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,793
You understand that?

456
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:38,354
Stop actin' Like an idiot
and go to sleep.

457
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:40,731
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sleep!

458
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,861
- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11:00.

459
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:46,395
- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.

460
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:01,844
You don't listen to me.

461
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:04,790
- What are you talkin' about?
- I asked you to apologize.

462
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,954
- You went there and insulted him again.
- I'm not his mother.

463
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:11,122
Charlie, you're his brother!

464
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:13,666
They tell you today
that you have a brother...

465
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:16,429
and I don't see in your face
one little reaction.

466
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:20,200
- I'm not saying joy.
- You don't know what I'm goin' through.

467
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,265
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

468
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:25,436
You don't tell me anything.

469
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:28,275
- You just give me lies!
- What lies?

470
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:32,511
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

471
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:35,782
I know it's not true.
So tell me, why is he here?

472
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:37,220
- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?

473
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,781
- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?

474
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:43,954
- 'Cause I got him and they want him!
- This makes no sense!

475
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:46,396
- Raymond was left all the money.
- How much?

476
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,592
- $3 million. Every penny of it.
- So?

477
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:51,795
I'm gonna keep him
'til I get my half!

478
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,100
What is this, huh?
Susanna?

479
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:01,677
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.

480
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:04,543
- What does that mean?
- I'm leaving.

481
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:07,642
You're leaving me now?
I need you!

482
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:10,243
You need nobody.

483
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:12,720
What does that mean?

484
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,658
Just take it easy!
What is my crime here?

485
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:18,286
Your crime is
that you use people!

486
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:22,321
- You're using Raymond, you're using me.
- I'm using Raymond?

487
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:25,390
Raymond, am I using you?

488
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:29,301
Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half hour ago!

489
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:31,306
What good is $3 million to him?

490
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:35,174
That money is only gonna sit there,
and I need that money.

491
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:39,510
You need it, so it's not Like stealing.
And then what happens to Raymond?

492
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,518
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or I'll put him in a better place.

493
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:46,987
- He is gonna be just the same.
- Only you have his money.

494
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:51,390
His money? That man was my father too.
Where's my fuckin' half?

495
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,088
- I'm entitled to that money!
- You kidnapped this man!

496
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:57,291
I did not take him.
I took my half.

497
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,334
- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.

498
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:04,862
You're soaking wet and you're gonna
Leave in the middle of the night. Wait.

499
00:37:04,862 --> 00:37:08,376
My father stuck it to me all my Life.
What do you want from me?

500
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:10,536
I want out.

501
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:04,720
- Stop that.
- Good morning.

502
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,630
- Coffee?
- That'd be good.

503
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:13,036
Dibbs, Sally.
461-0192.

504
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:15,596
How did you know
my phone number?

505
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:17,908
How'd you know that?

506
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:22,173
You said read the telephone book.
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

507
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:26,949
He remembers things,
little things, sometimes.

508
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:30,648
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

509
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:33,588
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

510
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:35,853
Did you memorize the whole book?

511
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:38,862
- How far did you get?
- 'G.'

512
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:41,228
'G.' Gottsaken, William Marshall.

513
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:44,097
- You memorized to 'G'?
- Yeah, 'G.'

514
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:48,696
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of 'G.'

515
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:53,073
That's good, Ray.
I Like that.

516
00:38:57,214 --> 00:38:59,808
- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.

517
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:02,613
- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.

518
00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:05,177
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

519
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:09,123
They got pancakes.

520
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:13,424
- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.

521
00:39:13,424 --> 00:39:15,759
You don't need toothpicks.

522
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:19,131
That was okay in the hotel with pizza,
but in a restaurant you use a fork.

523
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,692
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.

524
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,897
The pancakes
will keep sliding off.

525
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:27,534
I don't have my maple syrup either.
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.

526
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,805
You don't see any pancakes,
do you?

527
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:32,177
Of course,
maple syrup is not here.

528
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:36,150
Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

529
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,311
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.

530
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:40,820
We haven't ordered yet.

531
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,155
Maple syrup after the pancakes
is definitely too late.

532
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:48,958
How is that gonna be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

533
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:52,397
If we're gonna be here all morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...

534
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:56,403
I'm definitely not gonna
have my pancakes with--

535
00:39:56,403 --> 00:39:58,735
Don't make a scene.

536
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:01,672
Stop actin' Like a fuckin' retard.

537
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,364
What are you writing?

538
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,366
What the fuck is this?

539
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:33,305
'Serious'-- 'Serious injury list:
Charlie Babbitt'?

540
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,273
'Serious injury list'?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

541
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:39,708
Number 18 in 1988.

542
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,743
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988.

543
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:46,444
'Squeezed and pulled and hurt
your neck in 1988'?

544
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:51,055
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.

545
00:40:51,055 --> 00:40:52,590
Where are you, son?

546
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,922
That's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.

547
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:57,723
You have to bring him back,
Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?

548
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:58,922
No problem.

549
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:02,194
That will be $1.5 million.
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.

550
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:03,700
Don't touch that.

551
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,827
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.

552
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:09,305
Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.

553
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:10,806
He belongs here.

554
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:14,038
I'm his brother.
It's not Like kidnapping here, is it?

555
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,137
He's always been a voluntary patient
here, but that's beside the point.

556
00:41:17,137 --> 00:41:20,274
This is where he can get
the best care.

557
00:41:20,274 --> 00:41:22,512
We're talking about his well-being.

558
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:25,214
Yeah. Let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

559
00:41:25,214 --> 00:41:27,257
I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

560
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:30,623
If you won't cut a deal with me,
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...

561
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,628
I'll stick him in an institution
out there...

562
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:36,154
and we can have
a custody battle over him.

563
00:41:36,154 --> 00:41:37,961
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

564
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:40,127
Could you get him some?
Thank you.

565
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:42,228
Now, you wanna battle me
in the courts?

566
00:41:42,228 --> 00:41:45,570
You think about that, Dr. Bruner.
Think about that.

567
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,609
Or we can cut a deal right now.

568
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:51,168
I don't think you have any idea
of the severity of Raymond's condition.

569
00:41:51,168 --> 00:41:53,010
Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.

570
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,108
Can we just get him
some toothpicks?

571
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,550
I cannot make
money deals with you.

572
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,554
Then I'll see you in court.

573
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,125
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

574
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,664
82, 82, 82.

575
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,427
82 what, Ray?

576
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:14,935
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

577
00:42:17,105 --> 00:42:19,039
That's more than 82 toothpicks.

578
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,270
246 total.

579
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,674
Keep the change.

580
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,339
How many toothpicks are in there?

581
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:30,646
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

582
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:32,208
246.

583
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:35,651
There's four left in the box.

584
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,317
I have to get my backpack.

585
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:44,888
97X.

586
00:42:44,888 --> 00:42:47,456
The future of rock and roll.

587
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,230
97X.

588
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:53,702
The future of rock and roll.

589
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:58,105
97X.

590
00:42:59,846 --> 00:43:01,871
The future of rock and roll.

591
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:09,079
The future of rock and roll.

592
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,144
Ray.

593
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:12,191
Enough already.
Change the channel.

594
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:17,055
The future of rock and roll.

595
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:26,428
Lenny, I don't care what you think.
Did they say that?

596
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:28,699
You're gonna have to be
more forceful with them.

597
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:31,299
Lenny, are you--
Lenny, shut up a moment.

598
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:34,208
I am in serious trouble.
I can't get to these cars.

599
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,337
I can't get the money.
Do you understand that?

600
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:39,076
- My Loan is past due.
- I'll call the Loan officer...

601
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:41,312
tell him we have
a little problem.

602
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,753
- Listen, Charlie, let me talk--
- Lenny, just listen to me.

603
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:47,848
I'll be in LAX
in three hours, okay?

604
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:51,827
Now, remember, the Buick
is in A-3, main terminal.

605
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:54,864
Make sure they pick it up.
All right? See you in a few.

606
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,100
Will Dr. Andrew Baker...

607
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,801
please pick up
a white courtesy phone?

608
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:07,810
- Dr. Andrew Baker.
- Raymond, let's go.

609
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,644
Ray, let's go. Come on.

610
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:17,748
- What were you watching?
- I don't know.

611
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:19,118
You don't know?

612
00:44:19,118 --> 00:44:22,646
Final call for flight 1559...

613
00:44:22,646 --> 00:44:26,349
service to Salt Lake City
and Los Angeles.

614
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,276
There's an airplane out there.

615
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:32,378
That's right,
and everybody's boarding. Let's go.

616
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,390
- Airline travel's very dangerous.
- Don't be silly.

617
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,858
It's the safest travel in the world.
You'll love this. Trust me.

618
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,150
Now come on.

619
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,029
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

620
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:46,659
- Why do you think we're here?
- Flying's very dangerous.

621
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:48,669
In 1987, there were
30 airline accidents.

622
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:51,934
211 were fatalities
and 230 were definitely passengers.

623
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,941
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

624
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,203
I gotta get to L.A.
I don't have time for this shit.

625
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:58,906
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

626
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:00,573
- You don't know?
- No.

627
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,776
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.

628
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:07,084
Okay, fine. We can--
There's an American plane.

629
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:08,885
American flight 625...

630
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:11,482
crashed April 27, 1976.

631
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:14,786
We don't have to take American.
There's a lot of flights.

632
00:45:14,786 --> 00:45:16,125
Pick another airline.

633
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:20,566
- Continental. We'll take Continental.
- Continental crashed November 15, 1987.

634
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:23,102
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

635
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,239
- This is very serious.
- Yeah, very serious.

636
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:29,799
I have to get to Los Angeles.
So you're gonna get on that plane.

637
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:31,401
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

638
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:33,708
- You have to get on a plane.
- Yeah.

639
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,646
Now, there's a Delta.

640
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:39,913
- Yeah.
- It leaves at midnight.

641
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:41,113
How's Delta?

642
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,680
Delta crashed August 2, 1985.
Lockheed L-1011.

643
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,749
Dallas-Fort Worth.
Terrible wind shear.

644
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:49,022
- All airlines--
- 135 passengers.

645
00:45:49,022 --> 00:45:51,496
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

646
00:45:51,496 --> 00:45:53,532
That doesn't mean
that they are not safe.

647
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:55,328
- Quantas.
- Quantas?

648
00:45:55,328 --> 00:45:56,960
Quantas never crashed.

649
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,004
- Quantas?
- Never crashed.

650
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,202
- Well, that's--
- Never crashed.

651
00:46:03,202 --> 00:46:05,210
That's gonna do me
a lot of good.

652
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,712
Quantas doesn't fly to L.A.
out of Cincinnati.

653
00:46:07,712 --> 00:46:10,248
- You have got to get to Melbourne...
- Australia.

654
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:12,647
in order to get the plane
that flies to Los Angeles.

655
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:14,413
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

656
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:16,182
- 16.2 million population.
- Let's go.

657
00:46:16,182 --> 00:46:17,586
Very lovely beaches.

658
00:46:17,586 --> 00:46:20,557
We're getting on this plane!

659
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,720
Ray! Ray! Ray!

660
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:33,497
We're not gonna take the plane.
He's okay. He's okay!

661
00:46:33,497 --> 00:46:35,562
We're not gonna take the plane.

662
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:39,301
Just relax.
He was upset.

663
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:42,368
We were gonna take the plane.
We're not gonna take it now.

664
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:45,074
- We're not gonna fly, okay?
- No flying.

665
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:50,650
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

666
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:53,756
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

667
00:46:53,756 --> 00:46:55,917
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles.

668
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,994
Okay? Come on, Ray.

669
00:46:58,994 --> 00:47:00,552
Ray? Come on.

670
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:02,393
- Yeah.
- Come here.

671
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:04,399
- No flying.
- We're not taking the plane.

672
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:06,526
- Just grab the fuckin' bag.
- No flying.

673
00:47:08,304 --> 00:47:11,273
You're killin' me, Ray.
I just want you to know.

674
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:13,275
- No flying.
- I gotta be in L.A. in three hours.

675
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:15,311
It's gonna take me three days.

676
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:16,777
Come on!

677
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:21,048
No flying.

678
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,709
- No flying.
- No flying.

679
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,582
I got 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

680
00:47:27,582 --> 00:47:29,988
- I watch 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.
- Don't start with that.

681
00:47:29,988 --> 00:47:31,992
'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

682
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:09,189
- Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.
- Go ahead, 1-0-9.

683
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:11,890
Can you get another unit here
for point control?

684
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,434
Two more over to you. 10-40.

685
00:48:16,336 --> 00:48:17,997
Let's go!

686
00:48:20,574 --> 00:48:22,598
- Bring some more up.
- What's your E.T.A.?

687
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:26,937
Ray?

688
00:48:27,847 --> 00:48:29,906
Get in the car.

689
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:33,010
Get in the car.
Are you crazy?

690
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,916
We'll be outta this in a second.

691
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,477
- Yeah.
- That's good.

692
00:48:36,477 --> 00:48:38,682
It's okay. That's right.

693
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:41,591
Yeah. We'll be outta here
in a few seconds. That's good.

694
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:44,993
- That's good. That's good.
- There's a fatal accident over there.

695
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:49,256
We don't need your help.
Go back to your car.

696
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:51,460
Just a minute!

697
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,667
Son of a bitch! Ray?

698
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,442
Excuse-- Hey--

699
00:49:00,442 --> 00:49:02,503
- Just wait--
- There's nothing to see here.

700
00:49:02,503 --> 00:49:04,844
- Go back to your car.
- Yes, sir.

701
00:49:04,844 --> 00:49:07,316
- Wrecks make him nervous.
- Get in your car.

702
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:09,945
Yes, sir. Just stay there
by the side, okay, Raymond?

703
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:12,046
- Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

704
00:49:12,046 --> 00:49:14,488
Yeah.
Definitely a lot of traffic.

705
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,494
A lot of work for $3 million.

706
00:49:17,494 --> 00:49:20,189
I'd Like to Leave him on the highway
and get outta here.

707
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,959
What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

708
00:49:27,804 --> 00:49:30,466
- Memorial Hospital is ready--
- Stay in your car!

709
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,514
What's it gonna be, Ray?

710
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,550
This is
a very dangerous highway.

711
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,084
How will I get to L.A.?

712
00:49:43,084 --> 00:49:45,712
Driving a car on this interstate
is very dangerous.

713
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:47,881
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

714
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,188
- Yeah.
- Well, you gotta get in the car...

715
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:52,193
in order to get off the highway!

716
00:49:52,193 --> 00:49:55,196
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers
were involved in fatal accidents.

717
00:49:58,234 --> 00:50:00,326
I got a great idea.

718
00:50:00,326 --> 00:50:03,098
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.

719
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:06,938
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

720
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:08,441
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

721
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:10,774
Give me five, Ray.
That's a great idea.

722
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,542
Give me five. Yeah.
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

723
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,621
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.

724
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,319
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

725
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:29,955
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

726
00:50:29,955 --> 00:50:31,190
Who is on first.

727
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,432
Whose wife? Yes.

728
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:36,765
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

729
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:37,769
Absolutely.

730
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,466
All I'm tryin' to find out
is what the guy's name on first base.

731
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:42,475
No, what is on second base.

732
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:45,273
I'm not asking you who's on second base?
Who's on first?

733
00:50:45,273 --> 00:50:47,643
- That's what I'm tryin' to find out.
- Get in the car!

734
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:49,943
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

735
00:50:49,943 --> 00:50:53,111
Get in the car. Yeah.
I have to be in bed by 11:00.

736
00:50:53,111 --> 00:50:55,655
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

737
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:03,856
Now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

738
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:05,989
We have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out.

739
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:07,999
We're not flying.
We're not on the interstate.

740
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,900
I'm on some shit secondary road.
I gotta make up time.

741
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,960
I should've been in Los Angeles
this afternoon.

742
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,903
My business needs me.
I gotta make up time.

743
00:51:14,903 --> 00:51:18,670
Definitely watch TV, but be
in bed by 11:00. Lights out.

744
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,938
Forget it.

745
00:51:19,938 --> 00:51:21,946
19 minutes to 11:00.

746
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,962
This is a good one.
'We don't go out when it rains.'

747
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:41,464
This is a good one.
I hope you appreciate this...

748
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,932
because my business
is going down the toilet.

749
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:45,628
I should be in L.A.

750
00:51:45,628 --> 00:51:49,696
Instead I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel
in Bumblefuck, Missouri...

751
00:51:49,696 --> 00:51:51,866
because you won't
go out when it rains.

752
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:55,035
It's mystifying. It really is.
Fuckin' mystifying.

753
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,444
What is this?
Good news, bad news?

754
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,387
We passed D.O.T.
but failed E.P.A. again.

755
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,547
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

756
00:52:06,547 --> 00:52:10,025
Well, yes, sir. I'm just stuck
in Cincinnati since the funeral.

757
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:13,028
So many leftover details.
My family is...

758
00:52:13,028 --> 00:52:15,189
needless to say,
quite overwhelmed.

759
00:52:15,189 --> 00:52:17,495
Yeah, well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

760
00:52:17,495 --> 00:52:19,694
It is a shock, to say the least.

761
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,865
Thank you. Can I get
an extension on that Loan?

762
00:52:23,865 --> 00:52:26,909
A couple of days
would make a big difference.

763
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:37,018
'We don't go out when it's raining.'

764
00:52:41,456 --> 00:52:43,390
What? Speak up, Lenny.

765
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,392
I didn't buy that kind of time.

766
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:47,428
I want you to go down--
How much?

767
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:48,723
- It's 12:30.
- What?

768
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:50,230
Lunch is 12:30.

769
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,664
- Hold on. What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

770
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:54,598
- Fish sticks?
- Green lime Jell-O for dessert.

771
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:57,536
Green lime Jell-O.
Want another apple juice?

772
00:52:57,536 --> 00:53:00,335
I want orange soda.
Oh, it's 12:31.

773
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:02,342
I gotta go.
He's startin' to rock and moan.

774
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:04,844
- 12:32. Definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

775
00:53:04,844 --> 00:53:07,039
- Give me that gun.
- Where is he?

776
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:09,676
Where is he?

777
00:53:09,676 --> 00:53:11,717
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

778
00:53:11,717 --> 00:53:14,778
'Frame'? Where is he?

779
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,914
- There's four fish sticks.
- Huh?

780
00:53:16,914 --> 00:53:19,424
There's supposed to be eight.
There's only four.

781
00:53:19,424 --> 00:53:21,255
There's eight.

782
00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:23,558
You take a shower, Ray?

783
00:53:23,558 --> 00:53:26,928
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

784
00:53:26,928 --> 00:53:29,628
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

785
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:32,137
What do you say, Ray?

786
00:53:32,137 --> 00:53:34,173
'Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

787
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:37,070
That's the end
of that conversation.

788
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:40,145
- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200.

789
00:53:40,145 --> 00:53:45,013
The answer: 'Shakespeare wrote
over 150 poems in this 14-line form.'

790
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,052
- What is a sonnet?
- What is a sonnet?

791
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:49,053
- You got it.
- Double letters for 200.

792
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:53,490
The top of that one. 'The last word
in the Pledge of Allegiance.' Mark.

793
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,924
- What is 'stands'?
- No.

794
00:53:54,924 --> 00:53:56,427
Stu, Stu, Stu.

795
00:53:56,427 --> 00:54:00,328
Legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

796
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:05,229
He didn't figure anyone would show up
to contest his authority.

797
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:08,602
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody...

798
00:54:08,602 --> 00:54:10,607
and the $3 million, right?

799
00:54:10,607 --> 00:54:15,135
And you set up a date-- Yeah, you set up
a date for the custody hearing.

800
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:17,681
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

801
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:20,240
I found that it wasn't
an original record...

802
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,478
because the original song
had two verses--

803
00:54:22,478 --> 00:54:25,989
She hasn't come in?
She hasn't called?

804
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:29,025
If you hear from her, tell her
to call me at this number.

805
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,400
The Air Alpha Force,
from Nike.

806
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:50,871
Look at that.
1957 Studebaker Goldenhawk.

807
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,436
0 to 60 in under 8 seconds.

808
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:54,983
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

809
00:54:54,983 --> 00:54:57,542
- It's beautiful.
- 'Course, I'm an excellent driver.

810
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:59,554
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

811
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:01,785
When did you drive?

812
00:55:01,785 --> 00:55:04,791
I drove the Buick on the driveway
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

813
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:08,859
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

814
00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:10,057
Yeah.

815
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,668
- He let you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, slow on the driveway.

816
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,966
We'll have to let you
drive sometime.

817
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:24,843
You never touch this steering wheel
when I'm driving! Do you hear me?

818
00:55:24,843 --> 00:55:26,039
- Yeah.
- Do you hear me?

819
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:29,015
- I don't have my underwear.
- What?

820
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:31,018
I'm definitely not wearing
my underwear.

821
00:55:31,018 --> 00:55:34,180
-I gave you a pair of mine this morning.
-They're not my underwear.

822
00:55:35,622 --> 00:55:37,886
I told you to put 'em on.
Where are they?

823
00:55:37,886 --> 00:55:40,051
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

824
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:41,424
- Where?
- Here.

825
00:55:42,796 --> 00:55:44,991
- These are too tight.
- I don't want them back.

826
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:47,693
- Mine are boxer shorts.
- What's the difference?

827
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:50,531
- These are Hanes 32.
- Underwear is underwear.

828
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:52,662
My boxer shorts have my name.
It says 'Raymond.'

829
00:55:52,662 --> 00:55:55,867
All right. When we pass a store,
we'll pick up some boxer shorts.

830
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:58,809
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

831
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:01,142
We're not going back.
Don't start with that.

832
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:03,182
- 400 Oak Street.
- We're not going back.

833
00:56:03,182 --> 00:56:05,445
You don't have to go
to Cincinnati for boxer shorts.

834
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,918
- Oak and Burnett in Cincinnati.
- What did I say?

835
00:56:07,918 --> 00:56:10,547
- It's Kmart.
- I know you hear me.

836
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:13,250
- My boxer shorts have--
- You don't fool me.

837
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,418
Yours are too tight.

838
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:17,394
Did you fuckin' hear what I said?

839
00:56:17,394 --> 00:56:18,555
Shut up!

840
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:23,992
Cincinnati's a Long way off.

841
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:26,902
You're getting further away
from Kmart.

842
00:56:26,902 --> 00:56:29,702
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get underwear at Kmart.

843
00:56:29,702 --> 00:56:31,708
You have to go to Kmart,
400 Oak Street.

844
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:34,040
We are not going to Cincinnati,
and that's final.

845
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,639
- Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.
- That is final. Did you hear me?

846
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:47,056
I'm goin' out of my mind!

847
00:56:47,056 --> 00:56:51,323
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

848
00:56:51,323 --> 00:56:55,024
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!

849
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:58,591
It is underwear wherever you buy it,
in Cincinnati or wherever!

850
00:56:59,703 --> 00:57:01,694
- Kmart.
- You know what I think?

851
00:57:01,694 --> 00:57:05,104
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit.

852
00:57:05,104 --> 00:57:08,202
You can't tell me that you're
not in there somewhere.

853
00:57:08,202 --> 00:57:09,609
Boxer shorts.

854
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,105
Boxer shorts. Kmart.

855
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:15,247
These are--
These are Hanes 32.

856
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,685
- Driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

857
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,451
We have to make a little stop,
find a psychiatrist...

858
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:23,458
'cause you're driving me crazy.

859
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,460
- Oak and Burnett.
- You are driving me--

860
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,587
We have to buy them at Kmart,
Oak and Burnett...

861
00:57:27,587 --> 00:57:29,359
back in--

862
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,696
You put your shorts
on the highway.

863
00:57:32,696 --> 00:57:35,101
We have to go back
to Cincinnati and Kmart.

864
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:03,263
Good luck finding
a shrink in this town.

865
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:35,788
Raymond?

866
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,065
Hey, you.

867
00:59:19,065 --> 00:59:20,900
Dipshit, move it!

868
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:26,576
If you ain't gonna move,
I'll move you.

869
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:28,737
Hey, buddy.

870
00:59:28,737 --> 00:59:30,280
You'll get run over.

871
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,839
- You're gonna get hurt.
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

872
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:35,647
- Do you hear me?
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

873
00:59:35,647 --> 00:59:39,178
- Move it.
- Hey, it's all right, sir.

874
00:59:39,178 --> 00:59:41,248
I'm sorry. Raymond?

875
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:42,486
- Yeah.
- Come on.

876
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:45,529
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

877
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:47,530
Raymond, come on.

878
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,623
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

879
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:51,634
- It said, 'Don't walk.'
- Yes, it's broken.

880
00:59:51,634 --> 00:59:53,636
It said, 'Don't walk.'

881
00:59:54,706 --> 00:59:56,799
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

882
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,604
400 Oak and Burnett.

883
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:05,009
He said, 'Young man, go west'...

884
01:00:05,009 --> 01:00:07,550
and this is the way
our country developed...

885
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:10,348
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

886
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:13,184
During that period of time...

887
01:00:13,184 --> 01:00:15,782
there was initiated...

888
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:20,056
what was known as
the Pony Express.

889
01:00:20,056 --> 01:00:23,929
I'm sure you have read something about
it in the history of the United States.

890
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:26,833
I may not have the days
or the years exactly right...

891
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:31,498
but I'm more or less familiar
with the history of the United States.

892
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:34,407
- I love to tell the story--
- He's 'artistic'?

893
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:36,034
No, he's autistic.

894
01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:38,842
I'm not familiar with that.

895
01:00:38,842 --> 01:00:40,815
What is the exact nature
of the problem?

896
01:00:40,815 --> 01:00:42,406
...in St. Joe's, Missouri--

897
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,817
He lives in a world of his own.

898
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:48,515
I'm sorry,
but what's wrong with him?

899
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:51,650
It was a problem gettin' mail
from the East Coast--

900
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:55,822
-Raymond, do 'What's On First?' for her.
-Who's on first. What's on second.

901
01:00:58,432 --> 01:01:02,368
They set up an initial program...

902
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:04,495
where the Pony Express...

903
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:08,565
would ride for approximately
20 miles--

904
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:11,372
What am I supposed to do?

905
01:01:11,372 --> 01:01:14,209
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

906
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:16,215
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist...

907
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:18,877
but I do know his brain doesn't work
Like other people.

908
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:20,921
What he does
isn't intended to be annoying.

909
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:24,013
If he's gettin' on your nerves,
take a break.

910
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,957
- Spend time away from him.
- I'll just send him back.

911
01:01:26,957 --> 01:01:29,017
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

912
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:32,223
Inside joke. You're telling me
I just have to deal with this?

913
01:01:32,223 --> 01:01:34,391
I just gotta deal with it.

914
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:37,368
Yeah, that's about it.

915
01:01:37,368 --> 01:01:40,371
Out of curiosity, does he have
any special abilities?

916
01:01:42,341 --> 01:01:44,309
Well, he's got
a pretty good memory.

917
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:46,367
He counts toothpicks.

918
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,640
They spilled a box of toothpicks
on the floor...

919
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,684
and he took one look and knew
exactly how many there were.

920
01:01:51,684 --> 01:01:55,015
- He counted 'em in seconds.
- Ray.

921
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,384
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

922
01:01:56,384 --> 01:01:58,423
Are you good with numbers?

923
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,323
- Yeah.
- I read about this.

924
01:02:01,323 --> 01:02:03,451
- I wanna try somethin' here.
- Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

925
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,860
What'd I tell you?
After this.

926
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,399
- Ray, can we try somethin'?
- Yeah.

927
01:02:08,399 --> 01:02:11,401
Do you know how much 312...

928
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:13,767
times 123 is?

929
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:16,329
38,376.

930
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:17,965
He's right.

931
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:19,805
- What?
- He's right.

932
01:02:19,805 --> 01:02:21,845
- He's right?
- Yeah. Ray.

933
01:02:21,845 --> 01:02:25,314
How much is 4,343...

934
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:28,579
times 1,234?

935
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,643
5,359,262.

936
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:32,688
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

937
01:02:33,758 --> 01:02:35,749
- He's a genius.
- Ray.

938
01:02:35,749 --> 01:02:39,192
Do you know how much
the square root of 2,130 is?

939
01:02:40,797 --> 01:02:44,597
46.15192304.

940
01:02:45,335 --> 01:02:47,495
- 2304.
- That's amazing.

941
01:02:47,495 --> 01:02:50,665
That is amazing. He should
work for NASA or something.

942
01:02:53,075 --> 01:02:56,603
If you had a dollar,
and you spent 50 cents...

943
01:02:56,603 --> 01:02:58,773
how much money
would you have left?

944
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:03,711
About 70.

945
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:05,720
- Seventy cents?
- Seventy cents.

946
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,882
- So much for NASA.
- We should go to Kmart.

947
01:03:08,882 --> 01:03:10,618
After this, Ray.

948
01:03:10,618 --> 01:03:12,353
400 Oak Street.

949
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:14,361
Do you know how much
a candy bar costs?

950
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:18,124
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

951
01:03:18,124 --> 01:03:20,531
You know how much one of those
new compact cars costs?

952
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:22,092
About $100.

953
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:27,237
In his case, he's pretty well off.
He's very high-functioning.

954
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:31,677
Most autistics can't speak
or communicate.

955
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,339
Do you know what 'autistic' is?

956
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:36,906
- Yeah.
- You know that word?

957
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,554
Are you autistic?

958
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:44,524
I don't think so.

959
01:03:45,592 --> 01:03:48,060
No. Definitely not.

960
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,763
...problem with the Lamborghinis.

961
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:57,235
Let me see if I understand this.

962
01:03:57,235 --> 01:04:00,238
It's gonna cost me
$10,000 additional for each car.

963
01:04:00,238 --> 01:04:04,299
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

964
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,640
What?

965
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,043
They wanna take out the manifold
and the carburetors...

966
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:10,173
in order to put in
a fuel injection system now?

967
01:04:10,173 --> 01:04:11,716
That is nonsense.

968
01:04:11,716 --> 01:04:14,514
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.

969
01:04:14,514 --> 01:04:19,024
Just Leave this on. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet E.P.A. now.

970
01:04:19,024 --> 01:04:20,718
What? No.

971
01:04:20,718 --> 01:04:24,559
You give me the number.
I'll call the conversion shop myself.

972
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,564
That's my pen.
That's definitely my book.

973
01:04:26,564 --> 01:04:28,792
Taking your book
is not a serious injury.

974
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,301
For serious injury, look at
the red book. That book is blue.

975
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:34,100
Forgive me. I've lost
my secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

976
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,902
- You're already number 18.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

977
01:04:36,902 --> 01:04:39,205
It's my book.
That's my pen.

978
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:41,302
12 minutes to Wapner.

979
01:04:41,302 --> 01:04:45,042
- It's definitely very small in here.
- Small... and safe.

980
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:47,845
- You don't wanna miss the party.
- What you're witnessing is real.

981
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:50,752
Do you know that?
There's a party in your honor, Ray.

982
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:53,915
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up.

983
01:04:53,915 --> 01:04:56,892
You know why there's a party for you?
'Cause you're the 3-million-dollar man.

984
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:58,894
- What you are witnessing is real.
- Ken Aldorf.

985
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:00,896
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

986
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:03,398
- Fart.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

987
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:05,560
- Fart.
- Did you fart?

988
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,763
- Fart.
- Did you fuckin' fart?

989
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:10,772
Oh, man.
Get the smell out.

990
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:15,134
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

991
01:05:15,134 --> 01:05:17,145
- Ken Aldorf.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

992
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:19,147
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

993
01:05:19,147 --> 01:05:21,149
We're definitely locked in this box
with no TV.

994
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:23,412
I just heard about this $10,000 charge
for every car.

995
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:25,750
- They're definitely gonna start--
- How can this be?

996
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,724
- 'People's Court' starts on the--
- You're telling me another $40,000.

997
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:32,488
They start on the button.
They definitely start on the button.

998
01:05:32,488 --> 01:05:35,531
I've got a problem.
I'll call you from my next stop.

999
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,361
We're not gonna make it
to the program.

1000
01:05:38,361 --> 01:05:40,994
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1001
01:05:40,994 --> 01:05:43,503
- Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1002
01:05:43,503 --> 01:05:45,665
Where am I gonna find
a television around here?

1003
01:05:45,665 --> 01:05:48,403
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1004
01:06:05,596 --> 01:06:07,587
Come on. Come on.

1005
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:10,524
You wanna get in there
and see the show?

1006
01:06:10,524 --> 01:06:13,899
Wanna get in and see the show?
Listen up.

1007
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:17,065
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it.

1008
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,309
You act weird, we don't get in.
You Listening to me?

1009
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:24,312
- Yeah.
- I want you to look normal.

1010
01:06:24,312 --> 01:06:26,405
As normal as possible, all right?

1011
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:28,609
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1012
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,245
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1013
01:06:31,245 --> 01:06:34,484
- Yeah. Uh--
- Don't rock and moan.

1014
01:06:34,484 --> 01:06:36,115
Put your hands down.

1015
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,398
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1016
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:46,866
- You're familiar with our work?
- You mean the TV ratings?

1017
01:06:46,866 --> 01:06:49,871
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected
as a preliminary candidate...

1018
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:53,032
to become our next Nielsen family
in the tri-county area.

1019
01:06:53,032 --> 01:06:56,134
- My husband's not home.
- If selected, you'll help shape...

1020
01:06:56,134 --> 01:06:59,977
television programming
viewed by our entire nation...

1021
01:06:59,977 --> 01:07:02,073
in return for which
you'll receive a check...

1022
01:07:02,073 --> 01:07:04,744
in the amount of $286 each month.

1023
01:07:04,744 --> 01:07:06,811
Who's he?

1024
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:10,586
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample--

1025
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:17,197
- That's it.
- Oh, boy.

1026
01:07:17,197 --> 01:07:18,596
You'll miss your program.

1027
01:07:18,596 --> 01:07:21,066
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1028
01:07:21,066 --> 01:07:22,863
One minute to Wapner.

1029
01:07:22,863 --> 01:07:26,270
I had you in there, Ray!

1030
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,501
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1031
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:31,602
They're in there
making legal history, Ray.

1032
01:07:31,602 --> 01:07:33,613
- Legal history.
- Oh, boy!

1033
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:36,047
- Oh, boy.
- What is going on out here?

1034
01:07:36,047 --> 01:07:40,576
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
That man is my brother.

1035
01:07:40,576 --> 01:07:42,781
If he doesn't watch 'People's Court'
in about 30 seconds...

1036
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:44,790
he'll have a fit on your porch.

1037
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:47,849
Now, you can help me, or you
can stand there and watch it happen.

1038
01:07:49,129 --> 01:07:52,462
We Like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1039
01:07:52,462 --> 01:07:55,989
...and she sees an identical twin.

1040
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:59,196
True, he didn't have his shirt on--
the other one did--

1041
01:07:59,196 --> 01:08:01,739
but they sure look alike to me.

1042
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:05,299
If it got on his chest, even if it
didn't burn or got real cold--

1043
01:08:05,299 --> 01:08:08,346
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.

1044
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:12,282
I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.

1045
01:08:12,282 --> 01:08:15,252
I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.

1046
01:08:15,252 --> 01:08:17,812
If I put it up
against a bare chest--

1047
01:08:17,812 --> 01:08:19,983
Ken, work with me.
I'll take care of you--

1048
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:26,560
- You know that song?
- My judgment is for the defendant.

1049
01:08:29,534 --> 01:08:31,968
We'll be back for the reaction...

1050
01:08:31,968 --> 01:08:34,527
to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.

1051
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:14,774
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

1052
01:09:14,774 --> 01:09:17,312
Must be some accounting error.
How much will this cost?

1053
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:18,642
Twenty dollars, sir.

1054
01:09:22,752 --> 01:09:24,276
Thank you.

1055
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:05,789
I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a Long time.

1056
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:08,794
- Definitely gonna be a Long journey.
- Just a couple of more days.

1057
01:10:08,794 --> 01:10:11,831
You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

1058
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:14,891
- The fella playing first for St. Louie?
- You gonna start with this again?

1059
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:17,834
It's just another motel.
You gotta do this every time?

1060
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:19,838
That's the man's name.
That's whose name.

1061
01:10:19,838 --> 01:10:22,569
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1062
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:25,907
Who is on first.
I'm asking you, who's on first?

1063
01:10:25,907 --> 01:10:27,946
- Yo, Ray.
- That's the man's name.

1064
01:10:27,946 --> 01:10:31,211
- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?

1065
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:34,411
-Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
-You'll never figure out who's on first.

1066
01:10:34,411 --> 01:10:38,217
Who is on first.
That's the joke. It's comedy.

1067
01:10:38,217 --> 01:10:40,281
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1068
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:41,621
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.

1069
01:10:41,621 --> 01:10:43,752
Every dollar of it. Yeah.

1070
01:10:43,752 --> 01:10:45,763
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1071
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:47,765
It's a routine
between Abbott and Costello.

1072
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:50,893
When you do it, you're not funny.
You're Abbott and Abbott.

1073
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:52,368
- Yeah.
- You understand me?

1074
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:54,632
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1075
01:10:54,632 --> 01:10:55,968
Whose wife? Yeah.

1076
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:58,202
- Ray?
- Yeah.

1077
01:10:58,202 --> 01:11:00,210
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.

1078
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:02,905
You know why?
It's not a riddle.

1079
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:04,914
And if you understood that...

1080
01:11:04,914 --> 01:11:08,350
if you understood that it's funny,
you might get better.

1081
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:10,944
All I'm trying to find out
is what's the guy's name on first base.

1082
01:11:10,944 --> 01:11:15,082
What's the guy's name on first base? No,
what's the guy's name on second base.

1083
01:11:15,082 --> 01:11:17,093
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1084
01:11:17,093 --> 01:11:19,095
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1085
01:11:20,163 --> 01:11:22,563
You know the fella's name?
Yeah.

1086
01:11:22,563 --> 01:11:24,566
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1087
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:26,602
The fella playing first for St. Louie.
Who.

1088
01:11:26,602 --> 01:11:28,637
The guy on first.
Who. The first baseman.

1089
01:11:28,637 --> 01:11:30,570
Who is on first.
What are you asking me for?

1090
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:33,041
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1091
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:35,043
All right, Ray. Come on.

1092
01:11:35,043 --> 01:11:37,375
We're gonna put the bed
by the window...

1093
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:41,679
we got your apple juice, we'll put
the pens and paper on the table.

1094
01:11:43,318 --> 01:11:45,252
- Did I forget something?
- The cheeseballs.

1095
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:47,789
- Yes.
- Definitely have cheeseballs.

1096
01:11:47,789 --> 01:11:50,916
- I forgot the cheeseballs. We got 'em.
- I have to have 12 cheeseballs.

1097
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:53,359
- Yes, definitely.
- Get my tartar-control toothpaste.

1098
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:55,453
We got that for you
a couple of days ago.

1099
01:11:55,453 --> 01:11:56,964
Where's my toothpaste?

1100
01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:00,296
Raymond.

1101
01:12:02,437 --> 01:12:05,531
Remember that doctor asked you
those number questions today?

1102
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:08,074
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

1103
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,837
I see it.

1104
01:12:09,837 --> 01:12:11,436
I see it.

1105
01:12:11,436 --> 01:12:13,481
What's that?
Will you stop for a second?

1106
01:12:13,481 --> 01:12:14,982
I see it.

1107
01:12:14,982 --> 01:12:17,540
Put that down.
I'm trying to talk to you.

1108
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,882
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?

1109
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:22,923
Why do you always have to act
Like an idiot?

1110
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:25,356
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?

1111
01:12:25,356 --> 01:12:27,394
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.

1112
01:12:27,394 --> 01:12:29,429
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.

1113
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:30,929
Rinse.

1114
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,670
Why'd you say--
Why'd you say funny teeth?

1115
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,707
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1116
01:12:43,076 --> 01:12:45,067
'Rain man'?
I said, 'Rain man'?

1117
01:12:45,067 --> 01:12:47,079
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1118
01:12:50,483 --> 01:12:52,883
Was I trying to say 'Raymond'
and it came out 'rain man'?

1119
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:54,921
Yeah. Funny Rain Man.

1120
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,849
You? You're the rain man?

1121
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,133
- Who took this picture?
- D-a-d.

1122
01:13:17,776 --> 01:13:20,608
- You lived with us?
- Yeah, 10961 Beechcrest Street...

1123
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:23,272
Cincinnati, Ohio.

1124
01:13:23,272 --> 01:13:25,909
When did you Leave?

1125
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:27,919
January 21, 1965.

1126
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:31,478
- You remember then?
- It was Thursday. Very snowy out.

1127
01:13:31,478 --> 01:13:34,218
7.2 inches. Snow that day.

1128
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:39,062
- Just after Mom died. New Year's.
- Yeah, Mom died.

1129
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:41,064
January 5, 1965.

1130
01:13:41,064 --> 01:13:43,191
And you remember that day
that you left?

1131
01:13:43,191 --> 01:13:46,327
- Short and sudden illness.
- You remember that day you left?

1132
01:13:47,904 --> 01:13:49,929
Was I there? Where was l?

1133
01:13:49,929 --> 01:13:53,033
You were in the window.
You waved to me.

1134
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:55,738
'Bye-bye, Rain Man.
Bye-bye, Rain Man.'

1135
01:13:58,115 --> 01:13:59,047
So, you--

1136
01:14:00,217 --> 01:14:02,515
- You were the one that sang to me?
- Yeah.

1137
01:14:04,288 --> 01:14:08,224
What did you sing?
What was that song?

1138
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:12,360
What did you sing?

1139
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:16,930
She was just seventeen

1140
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:20,628
You know what I mean

1141
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:24,867
And the way she looked
was way beyond compare

1142
01:14:26,142 --> 01:14:31,841
So how could I dance
with another

1143
01:14:33,782 --> 01:14:38,242
When I saw her standing there

1144
01:14:43,258 --> 01:14:45,192
Did I Like it
when you sang to me?

1145
01:14:47,662 --> 01:14:51,028
Did we sing any other songs
Like the Beatles?

1146
01:14:55,236 --> 01:14:57,500
Scary! Hot! Scary bad!

1147
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,438
Scary bad! Scary!

1148
01:15:04,778 --> 01:15:07,372
What's scary about it?

1149
01:15:07,372 --> 01:15:09,540
Hot water burn baby!

1150
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,915
- Water!
- 'Hot water burn baby'?

1151
01:15:12,915 --> 01:15:15,147
- What baby? Me?
- Yeah.

1152
01:15:15,147 --> 01:15:16,917
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy.

1153
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:20,448
- Water-- Hot water burn baby.
- I'm not burned.

1154
01:15:20,448 --> 01:15:22,791
I'm not burned.
Look at me, please.

1155
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,921
- Water burn baby.
- Please. Please!

1156
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,898
Hot water burn--
Tub burn baby.

1157
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,401
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

1158
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,404
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

1159
01:15:33,673 --> 01:15:36,436
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1160
01:15:38,543 --> 01:15:40,977
It's okay.

1161
01:15:47,787 --> 01:15:50,050
Time for Wallbrook now.

1162
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,522
That's why they put you away.

1163
01:15:52,522 --> 01:15:54,525
They thought you'd hurt me.

1164
01:15:57,162 --> 01:15:59,322
Never hurt baby.

1165
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:01,831
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1166
01:16:01,831 --> 01:16:04,801
Never hurt Charlie.

1167
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:06,804
What? What?

1168
01:16:06,804 --> 01:16:10,238
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1169
01:16:11,142 --> 01:16:12,200
What, Ray?

1170
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,442
What?

1171
01:16:22,019 --> 01:16:23,953
Come on. It's 11:00, Ray.

1172
01:16:23,953 --> 01:16:25,955
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

1173
01:16:35,231 --> 01:16:38,860
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1174
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:48,977
There you go. Right where you Like 'em,
at the end of the bed.

1175
01:17:01,023 --> 01:17:02,285
Come on, Ray.

1176
01:17:50,036 --> 01:17:51,970
Hi, it's me.

1177
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:54,198
You didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

1178
01:17:55,308 --> 01:17:56,900
Listen, l, uh--

1179
01:17:59,246 --> 01:18:01,180
I just wanna hear it's not over.

1180
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:05,208
I'm scared it's over.

1181
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:08,219
Don't ask me tonight.
I don't know what to say.

1182
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:11,688
- Let it sit.
- Something I'm not real good at.

1183
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:14,692
There are a lot of things
that you're not good at.

1184
01:18:14,692 --> 01:18:16,694
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?

1185
01:18:20,733 --> 01:18:22,667
- I'll see you.
- Ciao.

1186
01:19:49,866 --> 01:19:54,269
Why are you looking at that? I bought
a TV, and you're watching a dryer.

1187
01:19:54,269 --> 01:19:56,135
I don't know.

1188
01:19:56,135 --> 01:19:58,299
Because at the shrink hearing,
we'll have to prove...

1189
01:19:58,299 --> 01:20:02,141
you prefer to watch TV as opposed to
the clothes dryer, you understand that?

1190
01:20:02,141 --> 01:20:03,804
- Yeah.
- You Listening to me?

1191
01:20:05,348 --> 01:20:07,339
Turn this off
when you're not watching it.

1192
01:20:07,339 --> 01:20:09,441
- Yeah.
- You'll run down the batteries.

1193
01:20:09,441 --> 01:20:11,782
Then where will you be
at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

1194
01:20:11,782 --> 01:20:14,254
Yeah. The red one
always falls the same.

1195
01:20:14,254 --> 01:20:16,484
Why don't you listen to me?

1196
01:20:16,484 --> 01:20:18,493
You don't wanna
listen to me, do you?

1197
01:20:18,493 --> 01:20:20,495
You wanna go back to Wallbrook?

1198
01:20:20,495 --> 01:20:23,395
I gotta make
a phone call.

1199
01:20:34,175 --> 01:20:35,665
Lenny, it's me.

1200
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:38,678
Where have you been? I've been
sittin' by this phone for three hours.

1201
01:20:38,678 --> 01:20:40,680
I had to buy some clothes.

1202
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,684
Clothes? Charlie, we are
in serious trouble.

1203
01:20:43,684 --> 01:20:45,982
- Why are you buyin' clothes?
- Take it easy.

1204
01:20:45,982 --> 01:20:47,988
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there--

1205
01:20:47,988 --> 01:20:50,819
They repossessed the cars
to pay off the Loan.

1206
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:53,553
The cars are gone, Charlie.

1207
01:20:53,553 --> 01:20:56,494
And Bateman wants
his down payment back. They all do.

1208
01:20:56,494 --> 01:20:58,428
That's 80,000, Charlie.

1209
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:02,268
80,000. I don't have it.

1210
01:21:02,268 --> 01:21:05,361
You gotta pay these people back,
or it's all over.

1211
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:08,772
We're out of business.
What am I gonna tell 'em?

1212
01:21:08,772 --> 01:21:09,967
I don't know.

1213
01:21:27,092 --> 01:21:29,687
Son of a bitch!

1214
01:21:29,687 --> 01:21:32,491
Son of a bitch!

1215
01:22:06,696 --> 01:22:09,791
This would be easier
if you let me put the top up.

1216
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,801
You wouldn't have to fry.

1217
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:14,268
Put this lotion on
so you don't burn.

1218
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:17,330
Don't start with that.
You want me to put the top up?

1219
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:21,002
- I definitely Like the top down.
- I know. I don't want you to burn.

1220
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,376
Definitely Like it
when the top's--

1221
01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:26,779
It's all right.
Just take it easy.

1222
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:28,943
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.

1223
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:31,282
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

1224
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:32,878
Very slippery.

1225
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:47,499
Maldonado swings, and there's
a base hit into center field.

1226
01:22:48,837 --> 01:22:50,168
One run is in.
Here's Brenly going to third.

1227
01:22:50,168 --> 01:22:52,673
The throw by Davis... not in time.

1228
01:22:54,176 --> 01:22:56,575
Brenly in safely
at third base...

1229
01:22:56,575 --> 01:22:58,578
on Maldonado's single.

1230
01:22:58,578 --> 01:23:02,309
He held that ball too Long
in center field, don't you think so?

1231
01:23:02,309 --> 01:23:04,374
We'll look at it again.

1232
01:23:04,374 --> 01:23:09,584
Treadwell playing way over towards
the right side, shaded him to pull.

1233
01:23:11,225 --> 01:23:12,157
Here's Davis.

1234
01:23:14,128 --> 01:23:17,426
Yeah, he seems to hold it there
just a bit, Tom.

1235
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:20,262
Sort of double-pumped it.
Watch the replay.

1236
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:23,325
He loses all chance
on a play on Brenly...

1237
01:23:23,325 --> 01:23:26,430
even though Brenly
doesn't exactly run fast.

1238
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:31,837
And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit high.

1239
01:24:03,909 --> 01:24:05,843
Will you give me
a break with this?

1240
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:11,210
Ray, stop it.

1241
01:24:26,598 --> 01:24:27,929
J-7.

1242
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:31,768
- K-7? What's that?
- J-7.

1243
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:35,234
What's J-7?

1244
01:24:37,442 --> 01:24:39,501
What's J-7? The song?

1245
01:24:48,952 --> 01:24:52,388
Look out there, Raymond.
No, out here.

1246
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:56,991
'18 Wheels and A Dozen Roses.'

1247
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:59,584
- What's the number?
- E-5.

1248
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:05,934
'Cheating Heart,' Hank Williams.

1249
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:09,369
'Your Cheating Heart.'
'Course, that's Hank Williams, Jr.

1250
01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:11,372
D-1. D-1.

1251
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:16,945
'Blue Moon of Kentucky,'
Bill Monroe.

1252
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,947
And the Bluegrass Boys. K-5.

1253
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,141
How many toothpicks
came out of that box?

1254
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:25,517
246.

1255
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:29,124
- Yeah.
- 246.

1256
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,517
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

1257
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:39,967
- You watching that?
- Yeah.

1258
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,939
- You seeing that, Ray?
- Yeah. Falling on the ground.

1259
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,970
Okay. Now what do I have left?

1260
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:56,243
Two jacks, one 8,
one king, one 6...

1261
01:25:56,243 --> 01:26:00,082
two aces, one 10, one 9, one 5.

1262
01:26:00,082 --> 01:26:02,087
One 5.

1263
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:04,123
You are beautiful, man.

1264
01:26:27,313 --> 01:26:29,246
- I'm an excellent driver.
- You can't drive now, Ray.

1265
01:26:29,246 --> 01:26:31,545
You Listening to me?
This is very important.

1266
01:26:31,545 --> 01:26:35,108
When there's lots of tens and picture
cards left, then it's good for us.

1267
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:37,655
- Say it. 'Tens are good.'
- Tens are good.

1268
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:40,692
- Okay. And you're gonna bet one--
- One if it's bad.

1269
01:26:40,692 --> 01:26:44,024
- Two if it's good.
- That's right. Two if it's good.

1270
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:46,326
Now, listen.
Casinos have house rules.

1271
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:49,999
The first one is,
they don't Like to lose.

1272
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:54,367
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

1273
01:26:54,367 --> 01:26:56,703
That is the cardinal sin, Ray.

1274
01:26:56,703 --> 01:26:59,402
Are you Listening to me?
That's very, very important.

1275
01:26:59,402 --> 01:27:02,344
Yeah. Counting is bad.

1276
01:27:02,344 --> 01:27:04,005
Yes. Counting is bad.

1277
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:06,849
I Like to drive
slow on the driveway.

1278
01:27:06,849 --> 01:27:11,149
You get this right, you can drive
wherever you want as slow as you Like.

1279
01:27:11,149 --> 01:27:13,383
I'm an excellent driver.

1280
01:27:45,187 --> 01:27:48,588
Miss Sue Morgan, please pick up
the hotel courtesy phone.

1281
01:29:35,126 --> 01:29:36,592
- Rain Man?
- Yeah.

1282
01:29:36,592 --> 01:29:39,031
- Let's play some cards.
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:48,574 --> 01:29:51,304
- You want a hit?
- No. You've got 18.

1284
01:29:51,304 --> 01:29:53,469
- Want a hit.
- Sir, you have 18.

1285
01:29:53,469 --> 01:29:55,946
- He doesn't want a hit. Hit me.
- Definitely want a hit.

1286
01:29:55,946 --> 01:29:56,982
Hitting 18.

1287
01:29:56,982 --> 01:29:59,312
- He doesn't want a hit.
- Hit me.

1288
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:04,522
You took my queen. I've got a ten.
I needed that queen.

1289
01:30:04,522 --> 01:30:06,853
- I can't take it.
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.

1290
01:30:07,826 --> 01:30:10,260
- I need my own queen.
- There's lots of them.

1291
01:30:11,763 --> 01:30:13,731
- 'There's lots of them'?
- Lots and lots of them.

1292
01:30:14,799 --> 01:30:16,767
Hold on here for a second.

1293
01:30:20,005 --> 01:30:21,939
I'm gonna double down.

1294
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:25,442
Queen. Queen.

1295
01:30:25,442 --> 01:30:27,205
- Queen.
- Yes!

1296
01:30:27,205 --> 01:30:29,712
Yes, sir.
You gotta love this town.

1297
01:30:31,383 --> 01:30:33,748
I'm goin' for it, Nick.

1298
01:30:33,748 --> 01:30:36,809
It certainly looks Like it.

1299
01:30:52,902 --> 01:30:55,769
- You wanna bet one chip or two chips?
- Bet two.

1300
01:30:56,539 --> 01:30:57,631
Bet two?

1301
01:31:44,452 --> 01:31:45,942
What's your secret, guys?

1302
01:31:47,021 --> 01:31:49,353
We cheat.

1303
01:31:49,353 --> 01:31:53,018
This is Sam.
Tape table 47.

1304
01:31:59,699 --> 01:32:01,826
- About 85,000.
- 85,000?

1305
01:32:01,826 --> 01:32:04,335
- Yeah.
- Did you call the eye in the sky?

1306
01:32:04,335 --> 01:32:07,567
- Sam did.
- Okay, I'll take over from here.

1307
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:12,244
Do it again. Do it again.

1308
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:16,242
- Do it again. All right!
- Yes!

1309
01:32:16,242 --> 01:32:18,783
You're doing well.
I'm happy for you, sir.

1310
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:25,589
What do you see?

1311
01:32:25,589 --> 01:32:29,059
He's not catching the hole card,
and he's not past posting us.

1312
01:32:29,059 --> 01:32:32,825
- He's not using a computer.
- No, but something's not right.

1313
01:32:32,825 --> 01:32:35,423
No one can count
into a six-deck shoe.

1314
01:33:09,634 --> 01:33:10,895
Hold it here.

1315
01:33:13,203 --> 01:33:16,105
- Watch my chips. I'll be back.
- Go ahead, sir.

1316
01:33:19,309 --> 01:33:23,109
What are you doing?
You don't Leave in the middle of a hand.

1317
01:33:23,109 --> 01:33:26,513
We are red hot! The Babbitt brothers,
kickin' ass in Vegas!

1318
01:33:26,513 --> 01:33:29,517
- Wheel of Fortune.
- Cleopatra and Caesar are over there.

1319
01:33:29,517 --> 01:33:31,746
-Come on, Ray.
-Look at all this glamorous merchandise.

1320
01:33:31,746 --> 01:33:34,289
- A little one for bad, two for good.
- Yeah. Twenty.

1321
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:36,291
- Twenty?
- Yeah.

1322
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:39,522
- It's gonna hit on twenty?
- Yeah. Definitely twenty.

1323
01:33:39,522 --> 01:33:41,529
$3,000 on 20.

1324
01:33:43,632 --> 01:33:45,395
- Definitely twenty.
- Definitely twenty?

1325
01:33:57,145 --> 01:33:58,806
- It's not your game.
- Yeah.

1326
01:33:58,806 --> 01:34:00,848
- I lost $3,000.
- Yeah.

1327
01:34:00,848 --> 01:34:03,383
That's $3,000 I lost.
Come on, Ray.

1328
01:34:03,383 --> 01:34:06,079
Little black-- No? Easy, easy.

1329
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:08,247
Don't start banging yourself.

1330
01:34:08,247 --> 01:34:10,951
- Maybe we'll play later.
- Yeah.

1331
01:34:10,951 --> 01:34:13,549
- I'm gonna cash in.
- Yeah, cash in.

1332
01:34:13,549 --> 01:34:15,925
- You make me sad, Ray.
- Yeah.

1333
01:34:17,331 --> 01:34:18,492
Twenty.

1334
01:34:21,002 --> 01:34:23,469
We won $86,000 and some change.

1335
01:34:23,469 --> 01:34:25,471
- Right, Ray?
- 86,500.

1336
01:34:25,471 --> 01:34:29,566
$80,000.
Refund on the car payments.

1337
01:34:29,566 --> 01:34:30,904
And I owe--

1338
01:34:30,904 --> 01:34:33,378
What did I say I owe
to get the Rolex back?

1339
01:34:33,378 --> 01:34:36,882
- $3,500, six months to pay.
- $3,500.

1340
01:34:36,882 --> 01:34:40,283
We don't have to pay for a room.
That's comped. I'm free and clear.

1341
01:34:40,283 --> 01:34:42,412
I'm gonna take a celebration piss.

1342
01:34:45,224 --> 01:34:48,387
Don't go anywhere. Until I get back,
the sign says, 'Don't walk.'

1343
01:34:48,387 --> 01:34:50,452
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

1344
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:14,978
Are you lookin' for a date?

1345
01:35:14,978 --> 01:35:16,384
I don't know.

1346
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:18,389
- What's your name?
- Raymond.

1347
01:35:18,389 --> 01:35:20,549
My name is Iris.

1348
01:35:20,549 --> 01:35:22,558
Raymond, you like me?

1349
01:35:22,558 --> 01:35:24,151
I don't know.

1350
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:25,890
You don't know.

1351
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:29,661
If you gave me a chance, you would.
Why don't we get to know each other?

1352
01:35:29,661 --> 01:35:33,169
- To get to know each other.
- He doesn't have any money, honey.

1353
01:35:34,905 --> 01:35:37,396
That's all right, sugar,
'cause we are just talkin'.

1354
01:35:37,396 --> 01:35:39,443
Yeah, we're just talking.

1355
01:35:40,678 --> 01:35:44,444
- Let's go upstairs. What are you doin'?
- Getting to know each other.

1356
01:35:44,444 --> 01:35:46,449
- Just talking.
- What room? I'll bring him up.

1357
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:47,949
That's all right.

1358
01:35:49,352 --> 01:35:51,786
Do you want to stay
and get to know each other?

1359
01:35:51,786 --> 01:35:54,518
Yeah, get to know each other.
Just talking.

1360
01:35:55,325 --> 01:35:58,294
This will be interesting.
I'll be over here.

1361
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:03,832
- He doesn't seem to Like me. Who is he?
- My brother. I'm living in his room.

1362
01:36:03,832 --> 01:36:08,598
- He seems young to be your brother.
- He was born August 12, 1962.

1363
01:36:08,598 --> 01:36:10,104
It was a Sunday.

1364
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:13,969
What exactly do you guys do here?

1365
01:36:15,043 --> 01:36:18,274
- We're counting cards.
- You're counting cards?

1366
01:36:18,274 --> 01:36:20,645
We're counting cards.

1367
01:36:20,645 --> 01:36:22,877
We're counting cards.

1368
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:25,044
What else do you do?

1369
01:36:25,044 --> 01:36:27,054
We're counting cards.

1370
01:36:27,054 --> 01:36:29,283
I know that.
What else do you do?

1371
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,348
Are you taking
any prescription medication?

1372
01:36:31,348 --> 01:36:34,327
Whoa. Look, I'm outta here.

1373
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:37,896

1374
01:36:37,896 --> 01:36:39,899
- What time is the date?

1375
01:36:39,899 --> 01:36:42,162
I have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out at 11:00.

1376
01:36:42,162 --> 01:36:45,763
10:00, daylight saving time.

1377
01:36:45,763 --> 01:36:47,637
- 10:00, daylight saving--
- 10:00?

1378
01:36:47,637 --> 01:36:50,233
- 10:00, daylight saving time.
- You Like her? You think she's pretty?

1379
01:36:50,233 --> 01:36:52,245
Yeah. She's very sparkly.

1380
01:36:52,245 --> 01:36:55,373
- Definitely very sparkly.
- Very sparkly.

1381
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:59,620
I've never seen you in a suit.
He did a great job.

1382
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:02,211
You don't realize how good you look.
Do you Like it?

1383
01:37:02,211 --> 01:37:04,223
It's not Kmart.

1384
01:37:04,223 --> 01:37:08,352
How could you not Like that suit?
You look fantastic, Ray?

1385
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:11,693
- It's not a Kmart suit.
- Let me let you in on a secret.

1386
01:37:11,693 --> 01:37:14,165
- Kmart sucks. Okay?
- Yeah.

1387
01:37:17,536 --> 01:37:19,401
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

1388
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:23,498
It's a high roller's suite.
This is for you.

1389
01:37:23,498 --> 01:37:26,045
- You ever seen a room Like this before?
- Yeah.

1390
01:37:26,045 --> 01:37:27,544
What's up there?

1391
01:37:27,544 --> 01:37:30,013
What's up there?
You're not even looking.

1392
01:37:30,013 --> 01:37:32,949
- Yeah. Bed.
- That's your bed.

1393
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:35,816
I had them put it by the window,
just the way you Like it.

1394
01:37:35,816 --> 01:37:38,584
- Right by the window.
- Go on up.

1395
01:37:38,584 --> 01:37:41,592
- Just the way you Like it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1396
01:37:43,062 --> 01:37:45,394
Look at you with all
those lights, Ray.

1397
01:37:45,394 --> 01:37:47,931
You are Mr. Las Vegas now.

1398
01:37:47,931 --> 01:37:49,967
What do you think?

1399
01:37:49,967 --> 01:37:53,266
There's a lot of lights out there.
It's very sparkly. Very twinkly.

1400
01:37:54,172 --> 01:37:57,573
We made a lot of money today.

1401
01:37:57,573 --> 01:38:01,806
Forgetting the $3,000 that we
tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

1402
01:38:01,806 --> 01:38:03,870
Yeah, 'Wheel Of Fortune.'

1403
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:07,246
And I'm sorry about that.
I got a little carried away.

1404
01:38:07,246 --> 01:38:11,048
I got a little hot, Ray.

1405
01:38:11,048 --> 01:38:15,387
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

1406
01:38:17,294 --> 01:38:21,697
I'm apologizing. I got
a little carried away. The money.

1407
01:38:21,697 --> 01:38:25,895
I got a little greedy.
Wanna say somethin'?

1408
01:38:25,895 --> 01:38:28,563
I have to be at the bar
at 10:00 with Iris.

1409
01:38:28,563 --> 01:38:30,869
I gotta thank you, man.

1410
01:38:32,843 --> 01:38:34,776
You did it.

1411
01:38:34,776 --> 01:38:37,972
I was just there.
You saved my ass.

1412
01:38:37,972 --> 01:38:40,836
I'm just along for the ride.

1413
01:38:40,836 --> 01:38:44,930
Be at the bar at 10:00.
Have to go to a date with Iris.

1414
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:47,133
Iris, that's her name.

1415
01:38:47,133 --> 01:38:49,073
Big date. Gonna go dancing.

1416
01:38:49,073 --> 01:38:52,012
I have to go to a date
with Iris at the bar.

1417
01:38:52,012 --> 01:38:54,140
- Know how to dance?
- I don't know.

1418
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,706
You ought to learn sometime.

1419
01:38:56,706 --> 01:38:59,447
Yeah, have to learn
to dance with a date.

1420
01:38:59,447 --> 01:39:02,786
- I have to learn to dance with a date.
- I was just kidding.

1421
01:39:02,786 --> 01:39:05,087
You're not gonna have to
dance on this date.

1422
01:39:05,087 --> 01:39:08,891
I have to go to the date,
learn to dance. Definitely. Now.

1423
01:39:08,891 --> 01:39:10,989
You don't have to dance now...

1424
01:39:10,989 --> 01:39:13,728
but I'll teach you
how to dance sometime.

1425
01:39:13,728 --> 01:39:17,329
- You won't have to dance on this.
- Have to learn how to dance now.

1426
01:39:17,329 --> 01:39:21,670
I'm sorry I brought this up.
All right, Ray, my mistake.

1427
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:24,677
You got the only
famous dancing hooker in Vegas.

1428
01:39:24,677 --> 01:39:26,178
Stand over there.

1429
01:39:34,655 --> 01:39:37,020
- Come over here.
- Yeah.

1430
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:41,457
You hear the music?
Just watch my feet.

1431
01:39:41,457 --> 01:39:43,996
Raymond, watch my feet.

1432
01:39:43,996 --> 01:39:47,089
Just do what I'm doin'. Okay?

1433
01:39:47,089 --> 01:39:51,102
You feel the rhythm of the music?
We're just movin' our feet.

1434
01:39:51,102 --> 01:39:54,503
You're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

1435
01:39:54,503 --> 01:39:57,099
I'm the date, so you want to--

1436
01:39:59,212 --> 01:40:02,545
You wanna put your
left hand up Like this.

1437
01:40:02,545 --> 01:40:06,072
Raymond, don't stop movin'.
Payin' attention?

1438
01:40:06,072 --> 01:40:10,053
Put your left hand up Like this.
Left hand. That's good.

1439
01:40:10,053 --> 01:40:13,353
Don't stop movin'.
Good. Just Like that.

1440
01:40:13,353 --> 01:40:15,859
Take this other hand,
put it behind my back.

1441
01:40:15,859 --> 01:40:18,952
- Ray, you wanna learn how to dance?
- Yeah.

1442
01:40:18,952 --> 01:40:22,330
You gotta touch someone when you dance.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1443
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:25,734
All right?
Just put it right there.

1444
01:40:25,734 --> 01:40:28,295
I take my hand,
I put it up here.

1445
01:40:28,295 --> 01:40:30,465
Watch my feet, Ray.

1446
01:40:30,465 --> 01:40:34,602
The rhythm, the rhythm.
All right?

1447
01:40:34,602 --> 01:40:38,842
You can't watch my feet the whole time,
so you're gonna have to look up.

1448
01:40:38,842 --> 01:40:42,579
Now when I tell you to,
I want you to just look up...

1449
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:45,178
real slow, just keep movin'.

1450
01:40:45,178 --> 01:40:47,190
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1451
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:49,488
- Start lookin' up.
- Yeah.

1452
01:40:49,488 --> 01:40:51,823
A little more.
Keep movin'.

1453
01:40:51,823 --> 01:40:54,524
- Just a little more.
- Yeah.

1454
01:40:54,524 --> 01:40:56,725
A little more, Ray.

1455
01:40:56,725 --> 01:40:58,894
All the way up.

1456
01:41:00,938 --> 01:41:03,838
There you go, Ray.
You're dancin'.

1457
01:41:03,838 --> 01:41:08,207
- Yeah, dancin'.
- You wanna close your hand here.

1458
01:41:08,207 --> 01:41:11,941
You wanna put it Like that.
You're gonna turn me Like this.

1459
01:41:13,015 --> 01:41:15,644
Just turn me.
That's good.

1460
01:41:15,644 --> 01:41:18,186
- This is dancin'.
- This is dancing.

1461
01:41:18,186 --> 01:41:21,690
I don't know about you,
but I'm startin' to feel a little silly.

1462
01:41:54,922 --> 01:41:57,584
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1463
01:41:57,584 --> 01:41:58,919
All right!

1464
01:41:58,919 --> 01:42:00,993
You are a good dancer.

1465
01:42:00,993 --> 01:42:03,622
- You wanna give me a hug?
- Yeah.

1466
01:42:15,741 --> 01:42:18,836
I just wanted to
give you a hug, Ray.

1467
01:42:20,213 --> 01:42:23,579
I just felt Like givin' you a hug.

1468
01:42:38,731 --> 01:42:40,164
What are you doin' here?

1469
01:42:40,164 --> 01:42:43,633
- I'm unemployed.
- What do you mean?

1470
01:42:43,633 --> 01:42:47,570
- You don't know about the business?
- Yeah, I know. Come on in.

1471
01:42:49,808 --> 01:42:52,833
I'm glad to see you.

1472
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,503
Ray, look who's here.

1473
01:43:19,269 --> 01:43:22,602
It's not right,
what you're doing to Raymond.

1474
01:43:22,602 --> 01:43:25,198
- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.

1475
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:29,974
He's in Las Vegas in a suit
in a big room. It makes me sad.

1476
01:43:29,974 --> 01:43:32,173
Six minutes to my date.

1477
01:43:32,173 --> 01:43:34,944
Six minutes to Iris.

1478
01:43:34,944 --> 01:43:36,450
He has a date?

1479
01:43:38,054 --> 01:43:42,047
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that television everywhere we go.

1480
01:43:42,047 --> 01:43:44,718
Why do you have to bring
a Watchman on your date?

1481
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:46,728
A man's dancing.

1482
01:43:46,728 --> 01:43:50,061
But what does your date
look Like, Raymond?

1483
01:43:50,061 --> 01:43:52,896
She's very sparkly.
She looks Like a holiday.

1484
01:43:55,004 --> 01:43:57,905
- I haven't heard that one before.
- Mr. Babbitt?

1485
01:43:57,905 --> 01:44:01,170
- Mr. Kelso would Like to see you.
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.

1486
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:04,804
He's director of security.
Would you come with me, please?

1487
01:44:04,804 --> 01:44:07,211
Sure. Susanna,
you stay with Raymond.

1488
01:44:07,211 --> 01:44:09,716
- Right this way.
- Certainly.

1489
01:44:24,932 --> 01:44:26,923
10:01, she's not here.

1490
01:44:26,923 --> 01:44:29,300
She'll come. She will.

1491
01:44:38,612 --> 01:44:42,639
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.

1492
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:45,582
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1493
01:44:45,582 --> 01:44:48,815
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we analyze the tapes...

1494
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:52,256
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

1495
01:44:52,256 --> 01:44:55,920
These tapes suggest that you should
take your winnings and Leave the state.

1496
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,463
Someone has a good day
at the tables...

1497
01:44:58,463 --> 01:45:01,125
and you accuse them
of illegal activities?

1498
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:03,395
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

1499
01:45:03,395 --> 01:45:05,733
All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.

1500
01:45:05,733 --> 01:45:10,537
Those are the best odds you're
gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.

1501
01:45:19,685 --> 01:45:22,620
- Did you want to dance on your date?
- Yeah.

1502
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:26,919
There'll be other chances. Many pretty
girls would love to dance with you.

1503
01:45:26,919 --> 01:45:29,425
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

1504
01:45:47,178 --> 01:45:50,078
- I Like this music, Ray.
- Elevator stopped.

1505
01:45:50,078 --> 01:45:54,446
It's okay. You think you could show me
how you were going to dance with Iris?

1506
01:45:54,446 --> 01:45:56,382
- Yeah.
- Yes?

1507
01:45:56,382 --> 01:45:59,718
- Would you Like to dance with me?
- Elevator's on hold.

1508
01:45:59,718 --> 01:46:02,189
- Give me this.
- Yeah.

1509
01:46:04,728 --> 01:46:07,288
- Yeah.
- Show me how.

1510
01:46:07,288 --> 01:46:09,457
Charlie Babbitt taught me.

1511
01:46:09,457 --> 01:46:11,966
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.

1512
01:46:12,801 --> 01:46:15,862
Dancing in the elevator.

1513
01:46:15,862 --> 01:46:17,702
It's nice.

1514
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:21,743
You're very good.

1515
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:39,021
- Iris missed a beautiful dance.
- Yeah.

1516
01:46:40,261 --> 01:46:43,026
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, a kiss.

1517
01:46:43,026 --> 01:46:46,191
- Have you ever kissed a girl?
- I don't know.

1518
01:46:47,435 --> 01:46:49,699
You don't know?

1519
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:54,007
Open your mouth. Open.

1520
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:56,475
- Yeah.
- Like this.

1521
01:46:56,475 --> 01:47:00,310
Like you were tasting
something very good...

1522
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:02,848
and very soft.

1523
01:47:05,987 --> 01:47:09,149
Like this.
Close your eyes.

1524
01:47:15,962 --> 01:47:18,396
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

1525
01:47:26,673 --> 01:47:29,164
- How was that?
- Wet.

1526
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:33,979
- Then we did it right.
- Elevator's definitely stuck.

1527
01:47:33,979 --> 01:47:35,536
No, it's not stuck.

1528
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:41,245
Here.

1529
01:47:43,322 --> 01:47:46,120
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

1530
01:47:47,393 --> 01:47:49,723
- Like us.
- Yeah, Like us.

1531
01:47:49,723 --> 01:47:53,817
What'd I tell you, Ray?
I promised you could drive.

1532
01:47:53,817 --> 01:47:57,624
- At Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway.
- Charlie, this is okay?

1533
01:47:57,624 --> 01:48:00,131
- I'm an excellent driver.
- He's good on a driveway.

1534
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:01,153
Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?

1535
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,227
So, I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

1536
01:49:05,227 --> 01:49:07,957
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.

1537
01:49:07,957 --> 01:49:10,431
- Yeah. I'm nervous.
- I know.

1538
01:49:10,431 --> 01:49:14,334
Listen, I'm glad, happy--
I'm happy that you came to Vegas.

1539
01:49:14,334 --> 01:49:16,998
I know.

1540
01:49:18,008 --> 01:49:19,441
Ciao.

1541
01:49:20,943 --> 01:49:24,879
Ray, thank you for the date
in the elevator. It was really nice.

1542
01:49:24,879 --> 01:49:26,881
- Yeah.
- Ciao.

1543
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:30,146
- Thank you for the what?
- It's something between us.

1544
01:49:30,146 --> 01:49:32,585
- Between us?
- Us.

1545
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:37,921
Us, Ray?

1546
01:49:43,298 --> 01:49:46,268
Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.

1547
01:49:46,268 --> 01:49:48,962
Of course, there's
definitely no bed there.

1548
01:49:48,962 --> 01:49:53,167
No, this is a magic bed, Ray.
You just watch and see.

1549
01:49:53,167 --> 01:49:57,268
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.

1550
01:49:57,268 --> 01:50:00,280
Went to the video store.
Got a surprise for you, Ray.

1551
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:03,010
Picked up a video for you.

1552
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:06,211
Don't start with that, Ray.

1553
01:50:06,211 --> 01:50:09,950
It's not just another place, Ray.
This is my place.

1554
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:12,685
I'm asking you who's on first.
That's the man's name.

1555
01:50:12,685 --> 01:50:15,251
Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.

1556
01:50:15,251 --> 01:50:18,821
You got a first baseman on first?
Certainly. Then who's playing first?

1557
01:50:22,436 --> 01:50:24,870
- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?

1558
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:27,031
Yes.

1559
01:50:27,031 --> 01:50:29,041
- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?

1560
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:31,042
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1561
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:33,704
- Whose wife?
- Yes.

1562
01:50:33,704 --> 01:50:35,713
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

1563
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:37,476
Absolutely.

1564
01:50:37,476 --> 01:50:39,950
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?

1565
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:42,214
No, What is on second base.

1566
01:50:42,214 --> 01:50:45,883
- Don't you think this is funny?
- Yes, it's funny.

1567
01:50:47,893 --> 01:50:51,124
- Where'd you see this first?
- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.

1568
01:50:51,124 --> 01:50:53,358
- Dad, huh?
- Yeah.

1569
01:50:53,358 --> 01:50:56,366
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.

1570
01:50:57,902 --> 01:51:01,600
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.
I'd Like you to call me.

1571
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,198
Yeah, what is it?

1572
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:06,539
I thought I got the machine.

1573
01:51:06,539 --> 01:51:10,342
I just got into town, and the
psychological interview is tomorrow.

1574
01:51:10,342 --> 01:51:12,440
Yes, sir, I know that.

1575
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,849
I thought we should
get together and talk.

1576
01:51:14,849 --> 01:51:18,877
I think it might be in your
best interests to meet me.

1577
01:51:18,877 --> 01:51:20,219
When?

1578
01:51:20,219 --> 01:51:23,453
I'm at the Bonaventure.
How about tonight at 8:30?

1579
01:51:45,848 --> 01:51:49,807
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,
who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.

1580
01:51:49,807 --> 01:51:53,378
- Yeah, I know.
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.

1581
01:51:53,378 --> 01:51:56,254
- Good luck.
- This isn't a close call.

1582
01:51:56,254 --> 01:51:59,225
It's a formality. Your brother's
a very disabled individual.

1583
01:51:59,225 --> 01:52:02,162
Are you trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

1584
01:52:02,162 --> 01:52:05,290
No, I'm telling you
it's always been a lost cause.

1585
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:08,132
- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.

1586
01:52:08,132 --> 01:52:10,865
Your father put me in charge
of all the money.

1587
01:52:10,865 --> 01:52:13,806
It doesn't matter whether or not
you win custody of Raymond.

1588
01:52:13,806 --> 01:52:17,174
I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion.

1589
01:52:17,174 --> 01:52:21,443
- So you can't lose?
- I can lose Raymond.

1590
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:24,313
I care about your brother's Life
and the treatment he receives.

1591
01:52:24,313 --> 01:52:27,651
I made a commitment to your father
some 20 years ago...

1592
01:52:27,651 --> 01:52:30,053
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

1593
01:52:30,053 --> 01:52:31,989
What is this?

1594
01:52:31,989 --> 01:52:33,651
It's a very big check.

1595
01:52:37,265 --> 01:52:38,925
$250,000.

1596
01:52:38,925 --> 01:52:42,400
And no strings attached.
Just walk away, Charlie.

1597
01:52:43,671 --> 01:52:46,105
This isn't about you and me.

1598
01:52:46,105 --> 01:52:48,334
It's not about winning or losing.

1599
01:52:50,678 --> 01:52:54,512
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

1600
01:52:54,512 --> 01:52:56,640
You didn't have an answer.

1601
01:52:57,717 --> 01:52:59,844
I don't know.

1602
01:53:01,254 --> 01:53:03,518
I just realized
I'm not pissed off anymore...

1603
01:53:03,518 --> 01:53:05,956
my father cut me out of his will.

1604
01:53:07,527 --> 01:53:11,190
You probably knew he tried
to contact me over the years.

1605
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:13,823
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

1606
01:53:13,823 --> 01:53:17,733
If he was my son and didn't return
my calls, I'd have written him out.

1607
01:53:17,733 --> 01:53:20,397
But it's not about
the money anymore.

1608
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:24,666
You know,
I just don't understand.

1609
01:53:24,666 --> 01:53:27,769
Why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?

1610
01:53:27,769 --> 01:53:31,509
Why didn't anyone ever tell me
that I had a brother?

1611
01:53:35,052 --> 01:53:39,216
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

1612
01:55:24,024 --> 01:55:26,618
Ray! Come on.

1613
01:55:26,618 --> 01:55:29,661
It stopped.
It's all right.

1614
01:55:36,436 --> 01:55:38,427
V-E-R-N.

1615
01:55:38,427 --> 01:55:40,769
Vern. Vern.

1616
01:55:40,769 --> 01:55:43,707
My main man, Vern.

1617
01:55:43,707 --> 01:55:46,210
V-E-R-N.

1618
01:55:53,052 --> 01:55:55,316
My main man, Vern.

1619
01:55:57,990 --> 01:56:01,345
V-E-R-N.
Vern, my main man.

1620
01:56:01,345 --> 01:56:04,005
They got raspberry, blueberry...

1621
01:56:04,005 --> 01:56:06,776
whole wheat, peachy keen,
beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.

1622
01:56:06,776 --> 01:56:10,149
How about buckwheat?
What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?

1623
01:56:10,149 --> 01:56:12,085
- Pancakes.
- What kind?

1624
01:56:12,085 --> 01:56:13,952
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

1625
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:16,857
The maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pan--

1626
01:56:20,997 --> 01:56:23,590
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1627
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:26,100
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

1628
01:56:45,821 --> 01:56:47,755
Step back a little bit.

1629
01:57:08,042 --> 01:57:09,474
Hello?

1630
01:57:10,545 --> 01:57:13,308
Why don't you go
sit down over there?

1631
01:57:16,984 --> 01:57:18,418
Hello?

1632
01:57:18,418 --> 01:57:22,285
This is not a legal proceeding,
so there's no judge present...

1633
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:25,189
just the people
who care about Raymond.

1634
01:57:25,189 --> 01:57:29,127
Raymond, have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.

1635
01:57:29,127 --> 01:57:31,756
Raymond, right here.
How about this seat?

1636
01:57:31,756 --> 01:57:35,199
- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.

1637
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:38,533
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

1638
01:57:38,533 --> 01:57:42,836
Ray, the TV?
On the floor. I'm sorry.

1639
01:57:42,836 --> 01:57:46,208
I don't know an easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--

1640
01:57:46,208 --> 01:57:48,213
Have I lost already?

1641
01:57:48,213 --> 01:57:50,749
No, you haven't lost.
I'm not the judge and jury.

1642
01:57:50,749 --> 01:57:53,010
I'm just making
a recommendation to a court.

1643
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:56,748
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professional.

1644
01:57:56,748 --> 01:57:59,813
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years...

1645
01:57:59,813 --> 01:58:02,860
and Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.

1646
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:05,362
You've made up your mind.
I'll see you in court.

1647
01:58:05,362 --> 01:58:08,957
My brother came further with me
than he did with you in 20 years.

1648
01:58:08,957 --> 01:58:11,525
- It's not necessary to--
- You don't know anything about us.

1649
01:58:11,525 --> 01:58:15,130
- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.

1650
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:17,470
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

1651
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:20,271
- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.

1652
01:58:20,271 --> 01:58:23,542
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

1653
01:58:23,542 --> 01:58:25,605
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.

1654
01:58:25,605 --> 01:58:27,776
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

1655
01:58:27,776 --> 01:58:31,753
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

1656
01:58:31,753 --> 01:58:33,756
Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

1657
01:58:33,756 --> 01:58:36,986
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

1658
01:58:36,986 --> 01:58:39,426
- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

1659
01:58:39,426 --> 01:58:42,590
- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

1660
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:44,656
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.

1661
01:58:44,656 --> 01:58:47,567
Danced in the elevator with Susanna.
Kissed Susanna.

1662
01:58:47,567 --> 01:58:49,901
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.

1663
01:58:49,901 --> 01:58:53,033
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.

1664
01:58:53,033 --> 01:58:55,373
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.

1665
01:58:55,373 --> 01:58:56,912
- Wet?
- Yeah.

1666
01:58:56,912 --> 01:58:59,710
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

1667
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:02,842
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.

1668
01:59:02,842 --> 01:59:05,012
- You drove?
- Yeah.

1669
01:59:05,012 --> 01:59:08,579
-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.

1670
01:59:08,579 --> 01:59:11,990
He didn't drive on the highway.

1671
01:59:11,990 --> 01:59:14,722
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?

1672
01:59:14,722 --> 01:59:19,061
Well, things they tend to do when--
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.

1673
01:59:19,061 --> 01:59:21,625
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

1674
01:59:21,625 --> 01:59:25,297
He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.

1675
01:59:25,297 --> 01:59:28,241
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?

1676
01:59:28,241 --> 01:59:30,539
- This morning when--
- This morning?

1677
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:34,207
This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.

1678
01:59:34,207 --> 01:59:37,546
You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.

1679
01:59:37,546 --> 01:59:39,552
He got nervous,
but he's fine now.

1680
01:59:39,552 --> 01:59:41,952
Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.

1681
01:59:41,952 --> 01:59:44,617
We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.

1682
01:59:44,617 --> 01:59:48,058
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.

1683
01:59:48,058 --> 01:59:50,962
- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.

1684
01:59:50,962 --> 01:59:53,000
I'm not placing any blame--

1685
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,160
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.

1686
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:59,967
I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?

1687
01:59:59,967 --> 02:00:01,974
No one is saying anything.

1688
02:00:01,974 --> 02:00:04,840
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.

1689
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:07,345
- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.

1690
02:00:07,345 --> 02:00:10,247
- This is my family.
- I understand that.

1691
02:00:10,247 --> 02:00:14,116
Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.

1692
02:00:14,116 --> 02:00:18,748
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

1693
02:00:18,748 --> 02:00:22,056
You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.

1694
02:00:22,056 --> 02:00:24,891
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

1695
02:00:24,891 --> 02:00:26,897
There's some things
I'd Like to go over.

1696
02:00:26,897 --> 02:00:30,594
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...

1697
02:00:30,594 --> 02:00:33,536
and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?

1698
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,436
My father died.
I was upset.

1699
02:00:35,436 --> 02:00:37,202
That was wrong.

1700
02:00:37,202 --> 02:00:40,677
Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...

1701
02:00:40,677 --> 02:00:43,305
and you want to
take care of him.

1702
02:00:43,305 --> 02:00:45,542
Yes.

1703
02:00:45,542 --> 02:00:48,710
From the beginning
it was Like a kidnapping.

1704
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:51,584
Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.

1705
02:00:51,584 --> 02:00:55,319
But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

1706
02:00:55,319 --> 02:00:56,654
Yes.

1707
02:00:56,654 --> 02:00:58,991
- Look, that--
- Yes?

1708
02:00:58,991 --> 02:01:02,089
I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.

1709
02:01:02,089 --> 02:01:04,157
When it started out--

1710
02:01:04,157 --> 02:01:07,169
- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?

1711
02:01:07,169 --> 02:01:09,900
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

1712
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:12,806
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.

1713
02:01:12,806 --> 02:01:15,276
No accusations?

1714
02:01:15,276 --> 02:01:18,371
See, you have to understand...

1715
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:22,680
that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...

1716
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:24,345
in name.

1717
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:29,782
And then...

1718
02:01:32,929 --> 02:01:35,123
this morning we had pancakes.

1719
02:01:35,123 --> 02:01:37,222
Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--

1720
02:01:37,222 --> 02:01:39,790
Maple syrup on the table.

1721
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:42,303
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1722
02:01:43,472 --> 02:01:44,733
See, we--

1723
02:01:46,541 --> 02:01:48,203
I made a connection.

1724
02:01:48,203 --> 02:01:50,676
I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...

1725
02:01:50,676 --> 02:01:54,146
but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...

1726
02:01:54,146 --> 02:01:57,013
whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...

1727
02:01:57,013 --> 02:02:00,680
and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.

1728
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:02,120
I'm all for that.

1729
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:05,353
- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.

1730
02:02:05,353 --> 02:02:07,360
He can't decide for himself.

1731
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,793
He's capable
of a lot more than you know.

1732
02:02:09,793 --> 02:02:12,229
Why don't we ask Raymond?

1733
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:16,099
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?

1734
02:02:16,099 --> 02:02:18,900
- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?

1735
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:23,809
Do you wanna stay
with your brother?

1736
02:02:25,512 --> 02:02:28,810
Raymond, would you Like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?

1737
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:31,373
The doctor's asking you a question.

1738
02:02:31,373 --> 02:02:33,578
- So you listen.
- Yeah.

1739
02:02:33,578 --> 02:02:37,647
Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?

1740
02:02:37,647 --> 02:02:40,783
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1741
02:02:40,783 --> 02:02:42,919
- You do?
- Yeah.

1742
02:02:42,919 --> 02:02:44,257
You wanna stay with your brother?

1743
02:02:44,257 --> 02:02:47,731
Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

1744
02:02:47,731 --> 02:02:50,268
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

1745
02:02:51,503 --> 02:02:54,234
- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1746
02:02:57,609 --> 02:03:00,306
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.

1747
02:03:00,306 --> 02:03:03,438
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1748
02:03:03,438 --> 02:03:07,474
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

1749
02:03:07,474 --> 02:03:08,985
Yeah.

1750
02:03:10,322 --> 02:03:14,485
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1751
02:03:14,485 --> 02:03:16,458
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1752
02:03:16,458 --> 02:03:18,586
They're two separate things.

1753
02:03:18,586 --> 02:03:22,496
Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.

1754
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:26,093
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.

1755
02:03:26,093 --> 02:03:30,129
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?

1756
02:03:30,129 --> 02:03:32,641
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.

1757
02:03:32,641 --> 02:03:34,109
All right.

1758
02:03:34,109 --> 02:03:36,339
Just hold on here.

1759
02:03:36,339 --> 02:03:38,005
All right.

1760
02:03:38,005 --> 02:03:41,312
All right.
You made your point.

1761
02:03:41,312 --> 02:03:45,514
You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.

1762
02:03:45,514 --> 02:03:47,715
- It's over.
- Yeah.

1763
02:03:47,715 --> 02:03:50,725
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

1764
02:03:50,725 --> 02:03:53,023
- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.

1765
02:03:54,063 --> 02:03:56,054
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

1766
02:03:58,868 --> 02:04:00,859
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?

1767
02:04:00,859 --> 02:04:02,733
Excuse me.

1768
02:04:10,831 --> 02:04:13,266
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

1769
02:04:15,102 --> 02:04:18,560
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1770
02:04:20,974 --> 02:04:22,908
I don't know.

1771
02:04:28,281 --> 02:04:31,807
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1772
02:04:35,721 --> 02:04:38,452
- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.

1773
02:04:38,452 --> 02:04:42,051
- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.

1774
02:04:43,396 --> 02:04:45,557
- What?
- My main man.

1775
02:04:50,135 --> 02:04:51,569
Listen.

1776
02:04:55,207 --> 02:04:58,471
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.

1777
02:05:01,813 --> 02:05:04,373
Because you see, these--

1778
02:05:04,373 --> 02:05:08,715
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.

1779
02:05:09,621 --> 02:05:11,748
- You know?
- Yeah.

1780
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:17,520
What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.

1781
02:05:18,596 --> 02:05:20,393
Connecting.

1782
02:05:21,732 --> 02:05:26,101
- I Like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.

1783
02:05:26,101 --> 02:05:29,071
Yes, you are.

1784
02:05:56,332 --> 02:05:58,959
I Like having you
for my big brother.

1785
02:06:17,652 --> 02:06:19,983
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1786
02:06:23,091 --> 02:06:25,718
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1787
02:06:26,928 --> 02:06:28,691
Main man.

1788
02:07:01,895 --> 02:07:04,021

Hello, Raymond.

Wouldn't you feel more relaxed

You're gonna have to carry this now.
