22
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,985
[ Man #1 ] I've got four Lamborghinis
that can't meet smog emission standards.

23
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,182
How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?

24
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,557
[ Man #2 ] Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.

25
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,028
Three times?
You're on a roll.

26
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,657
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.

27
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,293
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

28
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,633
I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...

29
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,867
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.

30
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,476
Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.

31
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,567
Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.

32
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,078
I'll explain that
to my swing loan.

33
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,048
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.

34
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,916
I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.

00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,388
- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.

36
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,085
I got a shark snappin' at my heels.

37
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,651
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.

00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,700
I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.

This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...

41
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,805

by keeping my four cars off the road?

How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,148
Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.

45
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,376
- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing loan.

46
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,978
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.

47
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:18,387
- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.

48
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,293
Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.

49
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,490
I need this.
Come on.

50
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,500
I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.

51
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,002
His number?
He's on the road now.

52
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,300
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--

53
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,103
Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:30 a.m.

00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,643
- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.

Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

56
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,581
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

57
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,780
Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...

58
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,914
and the E.P A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.

59
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,982
- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm listening.

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,621
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.

61
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,064
- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.

62
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,561
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other line.

63
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,005
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--

64
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,600
What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.

65
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,205
We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

66
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,216
And because of your
incredible patience...

67
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:22,846
we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.

Well, yes,

We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

- No, not bad at all.

- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.

76
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,914
I got it under control.

77
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,204
I don't want to be demanding...

78
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:19,142
but could you possibly say 10 or
12 words before we get to the hotel?

79
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,737
Hmm? Consider it foreplay.

80
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,181
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

81
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,352
I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.

82
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:33,290
Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.

83
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,157
If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.

84
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,493
What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?

85
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:43,467
I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.

00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,801
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?

87
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:51,469
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

88
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,775
One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?

89
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,112
I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.

You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.

91
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,348
But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--

92
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,222
You wanna talk?
Let's talk!

I've been trying to contact you
for a while.

I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.

He's been trying to reach you.

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,500
Your father has died, Charlie.

99
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,512
- Charlie?
- Uh-huh?

100
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,914
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.

101
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,976
- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.

102
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,113
- Anything else?
- No.

103
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,387
- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.

104
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,797
- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?

105
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,700
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a long time ago.

106
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,830
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

107
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,171
We just didn't get along.

108
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,609
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,343
- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.

110
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,975
I want to.

111
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,783
All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to.

112
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,466
...to our beloved neighbor...

113
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,341
for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...

114
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,869
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

115
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:40,749
Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for life...

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,288
dedication to family...

and charity to all.

118
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,326
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection life...

119
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,765
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.

120
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,503
Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.

121
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,242
I can wait in the car.

122
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:50,818
Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.

123
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,825
Knew this car my whole life.
Only drove it once.

124
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:59,330
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.

125
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,865
Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.

126
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:06,370
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

127
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:08,905

00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:26,423
[ Susanna ]
You were his only child.

129
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,925
You came along when he was...

130
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,655
what, 45 or something?

131
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:34,527
He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...

132
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,897
so he had to love you.

133
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:40,870
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.

134
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:44,807
In these pictures here, he doesn't look
like a man who doesn't love his son.

135
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:48,209
What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.

136
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,372
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.

137
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:54,111
You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.

138
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:57,313
- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.

139
00:10:57,388 --> 00:11:00,482
'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'

140
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:02,856
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...

141
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,623
I bring home a report card
and it's almost all A's.

142
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,291
I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'

143
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,858
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

144
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:15,895
He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

145
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:19,876
You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?

146
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:22,640
Because l--
I deserved it.

147
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:26,081
Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?

148
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,914
We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.

149
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:31,421
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

150
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,923
Uh, pulled over.

151
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:37,723
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

152
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:41,287
Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.

153
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:45,427
Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'

154
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:48,097
Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.

155
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:51,198
- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?

156
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:53,709
Two days.

157
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,611
Were you scared?

158
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,149
Yeah, I was scared.

159
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:02,252
Left home.
I never saw him again.

160
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,016
Charlie, after a year
we've been together...

161
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,523
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

162
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,287
It's strange, huh?

163
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,296
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

164
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:18,199
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

165
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,669
The rain what?

166
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:25,402
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

167
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:28,912
- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.

168
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,041
Not so much.

169
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:36,085
[ Man ] 'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...

170
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:39,021
so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.

171
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,149
So full of yourself.

172
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:43,693
And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...

173
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,888
is understandable as well.

174
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:49,922
Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...

175
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,628
all these I forgive.

176
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:54,933
But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my life in any way...

177
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:57,736
has left me without a son.

178
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:01,768
I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.'

179
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,851
'l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...

180
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,856
that certain Buick convertible...

181
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:17,759
the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

182
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,959
Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.

183
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,967
May they remind him
of the value of excellence...

184
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:26,469
and the possibility of perfection.

185
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,370
As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...

186
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,603
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...

187
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,840
that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'

188
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,608
What does that mean?

189
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:41,277
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...

190
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:46,016
after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...

191
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,650
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

192
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:51,695
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

193
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:55,163
- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.

194
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:58,396
What is that?
How does that work?

195
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,336
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.

196
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:04,306
I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.

197
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,310
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?

198
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,539
What's his name got--

199
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,639
- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.

200
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,583
He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.

201
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:16,643
I definitely got
the rose bushes.

202
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:19,417
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.

203
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,288
- There's no need--
- To what?

204
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,555
To be upset?

205
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,995
To be upset?

206
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:29,726
If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...

207
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,066
and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.

208
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,902
Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?

209
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:40,341
- Were you listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.

210
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,675
Were you?

211
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:46,774
No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

212
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:53,249
I was looking for you.

213
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,258
How did it go?

214
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,794
I got what I expected.

215
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,539
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.

216
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:36,461
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.

217
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:40,971
I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.

218
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,233
- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.

219
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,418
Is this Wallbrook?

220
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:57,420
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?

221
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,581
Excuse me.

222
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:08,592
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

223
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,600
Would you like
to wait in his office?

224
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,102
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.

225
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:30,452
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.

226
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,437
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.

227
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:53,136
Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.

228
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,079
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?

229
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,413
- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.

230
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:02,975
I'd like to watch
the TV, please.

231
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:07,047
For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?

232
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:08,887
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.

233
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,359
Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.

234
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,363
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

235
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:17,094
In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

236
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:46,226
Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.

237
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,731
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

238
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,233
I knew your father
since you were two years old.

239
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,963
The year my mother died.

240
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:56,268
I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.

241
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,934
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.

242
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:03,275
I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.

243
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,440
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?

244
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,747
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...

245
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:11,310
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

246
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:14,654
And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.

247
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:17,592
I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...

248
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,595
help me understand
the right in what he's done.

249
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,757
Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...

250
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,597
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

251
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,171
I'm sorry,
this is not your car.

252
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,730
Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.

253
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,709
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?

254
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:37,714
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

255
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,240
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.

256
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,910
Of course, today's Monday.

257
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:45,922
I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.

258
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,618
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

259
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:51,126
- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.

260
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:55,029
Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.

261
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,795
Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.

262
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:01,326
- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.

263
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,703
Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.

264
00:19:03,774 --> 00:19:06,242
Now they're pitiful red.

265
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,744
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

266
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:12,541
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

267
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,578
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.

268
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:20,818
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

269
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,359
Only 8,095 production models.

270
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,952
Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.

271
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,964
- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?

272
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:30,466
- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?

273
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:34,129
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

274
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:37,299
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!

275
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:39,365
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

276
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:42,901
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.

277
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,643
Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?

278
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:49,277
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'

279
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:51,412
I wanna ask you a question.

280
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:54,125
What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--

281
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:57,058
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.

282
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,358
Bruner, who is this guy?

283
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,694
Raymond is your brother.

284
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:04,199
[ Raymond Continues Chatter ]

285
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:06,600
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

286
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,332
...and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:

00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:26,386
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'

292
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:28,391
- What is he, crazy?
- No.

293
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,926
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

294
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:33,225
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

295
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:35,231
I don't know what that means.

296
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,790
People like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'

297
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,735
They have certain deficiencies,

- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.

299

- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?

300
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:49,908
It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...

301
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,971
and how it's processed.

You're talkin' over my head.

Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

304
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,856
He can't even express himself
or probably even...

305
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:02,188
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

306

[ Man ] And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.

307
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,691
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

308
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:14,704
Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.

309
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:17,172
Rituals. That's a good one.

310
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:20,005
Well, it's the way he acts...

311
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:24,013
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.

312
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:28,074
- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How long has he been here?

313
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:31,519
- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?

314
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:34,183
He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.

315
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,954
- You've been here that long?
- That's when I started.

316
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:40,758
So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.

317
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:43,823
You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.

318
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:47,735
- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?

319
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:51,206
- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?

320
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,437
I don't know.

321
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:59,775
Does he know how much money
he's been left?

322
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,011
No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

323
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:06,850
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

324
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:09,188
He's just inherited $3 million...

325
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,093
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

326
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:16,428
Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?

327
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,628
Good ol' Dad.

328
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,740
[ Raymond ] What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

329
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:27,038
Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?

330
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,102
Why is he doin' that?

331
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:32,205
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'

332
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:34,217
- Yeah, why?
- Why?

333
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,118
It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.

334
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:41,681
- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.

335
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,193
- Ted Kloszevski.

This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

- Not to touch books.

347

- You like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?

- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.

- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?

- Stop it!
- Yes.

352

You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?

- I don't know.
- You don't know?

354
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:37,840
Maybe you'd better put it back.

You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.

356
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:46,218
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.

But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.

366
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:17,581
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.

367
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:22,182
I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.

368
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,662

didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.

What?

at the gate?

- It's for Raymond.

- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

398

You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

399
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,139
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

- I don't know.

- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.

I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.

- Today's an off day.

- Monday, no games scheduled.

Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.

He's out of town

All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.

You'll get in, and we'll take

- You're already number 18.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

1046
01:04:36,337 --> 01:04:38,567
It's my book.
That's my pen.

1047
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:40,664
Uh-oh. 12 minutes to Wapner.

1048
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:44,404
- It's definitely very small in here.
- Small... and safe.

1049
01:04:44,478 --> 01:04:47,208
- You don't wanna miss the party.
- What you're witnessing is real.

1050
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:50,114
Do you know that?
There's a party in your honor, Ray.

1051
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:53,278
When we get to LA., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up.

1052
01:04:53,354 --> 01:04:56,255
You know why there's a party for you?
'Cause you're the 3-million-dollar man.

1053
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:58,258
- What you are witnessing is real.
- Ken Aldorf.

1054
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,260
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

1055
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:02,762
- Uh-oh. Fart.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

1056
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,923
- Uh-oh. Fart.
- Did you fart?

1057
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:07,126
- Fart.
- Did you fuckin' fart?

1058
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:10,136
Oh, man.
Get the smell out.

1059
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:14,498
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

1060
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,509
- Ken Aldorf.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

1061
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:18,511
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

1062
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:20,513
We're definitely locked in this box
with no TV.

1063
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:22,776
I just heard about this $10,000 charge
for every car.

1064
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:25,114
- They're definitely gonna start--
- How can this be?

1065
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:29,088
- 'People's Court' starts on the--
- You're telling me another $40,000.

1066
01:05:29,156 --> 01:05:31,852
They start on the button.
They definitely start on the button.

1067
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:34,895
I've got a problem.
I'll call you from my next stop.

1068
01:05:34,962 --> 01:05:37,726
We're not gonna make it
to the program.

1069
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:40,358
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1070
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:42,868
- Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1071
01:05:42,937 --> 01:05:45,030
Where am I gonna find
a television around here?

1072
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:47,768
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1073
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:06,983
[ Charlie ]
Come on. Come on.

1074
01:06:07,895 --> 01:06:09,920
You wanna get in there
and see the show?

1075
01:06:09,997 --> 01:06:13,296
Wanna get in and see the show?
Listen up.

1076
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:16,461
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it.

1077
01:06:19,306 --> 01:06:21,706
You act weird, we don't get in.
You listening to me?

1078
01:06:21,775 --> 01:06:23,709
- Yeah.
- I want you to look normal.

1079
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:25,802
As normal as possible, all right?

1080
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,007
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1081
01:06:28,082 --> 01:06:30,642
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1082
01:06:30,718 --> 01:06:33,881
- Yeah. Uh--
- Don't rock and moan.

1083
01:06:33,954 --> 01:06:35,512
Put your hands down.

1084
01:06:38,859 --> 01:06:42,795
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1085
01:06:42,863 --> 01:06:46,264
- You're familiar with our work?
- You mean the TV ratings?

1086
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:49,268
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected
as a preliminary candidate...

1087
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:52,430
to become our next Nielsen family
in the tri-county area.

1088
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:55,532
- My husband's not home.
- If selected, you'll help shape...

1089
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:59,375
television programming
viewed by our entire nation...

1090
01:06:59,446 --> 01:07:01,471
in return for which
you'll receive a check...

1091
01:07:01,549 --> 01:07:04,143
in the amount of $286 each month.

1092
01:07:04,218 --> 01:07:06,209
-   [ Ray Humming ]
- Who's he?

1093
01:07:06,287 --> 01:07:09,984
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample--

1094
01:07:10,057 --> 01:07:12,582
-   [ Hums 'The People's Court' theme ]
- [ Charlie Sighs ]

1095
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,596
- [ Charlie ] That's it.
- Oh, boy.

1096
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:17,995
You'll miss your program.

1097
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:20,465
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1098
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:22,263
[ Charlie ]
One minute to Wapner.

1099
01:07:22,336 --> 01:07:25,669
-   [ Humming ]
- I had you in there, Ray!

1100
01:07:25,739 --> 01:07:27,900
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1101
01:07:27,975 --> 01:07:31,001
They're in there
making legal history, Ray.

1102
01:07:31,078 --> 01:07:33,012
- Legal history.
- Oh, boy!

1103
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,446
- [ Ray ] Oh, boy.
- What is going on out here?

1104
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:39,976
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
That man is my brother.

1105
01:07:40,054 --> 01:07:42,181
If he doesn't watch 'People's Court'
in about 30 seconds...

1106
01:07:42,256 --> 01:07:44,190
he'll have a fit on your porch.

1107
01:07:44,258 --> 01:07:47,250
Now, you can help me, or you
can stand there and watch it happen.

1108
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:51,862
We like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1109
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:55,390
[ Judge Wapner ]
...and she sees an identical twin.

1110
01:07:55,469 --> 01:07:58,597
True, he didn't have his shirt on--
the other one did--

1111
01:07:58,672 --> 01:08:01,140
but they sure look alike to me.

1112
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:04,700
If it got on his chest, even if it
didn't burn or got real cold--

1113
01:08:04,778 --> 01:08:07,747
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.

1114
01:08:07,815 --> 01:08:11,683
I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.

1115
01:08:11,752 --> 01:08:14,653
- [ Child Crying ]
- I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.

1116
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:17,213
If I put it up
against a bare chest--

1117
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,384
Ken, work with me.
I'll take care of you--

1118
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,122
-   [ Singing, indistinct ]
- [ Child Jabbering ]

1119
01:08:22,196 --> 01:08:25,962
- You know that song?
- My judgment is for the defendant.

1120
01:08:28,936 --> 01:08:31,370
[ Doug Llewelyn ]
We'll be back for the reaction...

1121
01:08:31,438 --> 01:08:33,929
to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.

1122
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:14,178
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

1123
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:16,716
Must be some accounting error.
How much will this cost?

1124
01:09:16,784 --> 01:09:18,046
Twenty dollars, sir.

1125
01:09:22,156 --> 01:09:23,680
Thank you.

1126
01:10:02,863 --> 01:10:05,195
I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a long time.

1127
01:10:05,265 --> 01:10:08,200
- Definitely gonna be a long journey.
- Just a couple of more days.

1128
01:10:08,268 --> 01:10:11,237
Yeah. You know the fella's name?
Yeah. Then who's playing first?

1129
01:10:11,305 --> 01:10:14,297
- The fella playing first for St. Louie?
- You gonna start with this again?

1130
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:17,242
It's just another motel.
You gotta do this every time?

1131
01:10:17,311 --> 01:10:19,245
That's the man's name.
That's whose name.

1132
01:10:19,313 --> 01:10:21,975
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1133
01:10:22,049 --> 01:10:25,314
Who is on first.
I'm asking you, who's on first?

1134
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:27,354
- Yo, Ray.
- That's the man's name.

1135
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:30,618
- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?

1136
01:10:30,691 --> 01:10:33,819
-Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
-You'll never figure out who's on first.

1137
01:10:33,894 --> 01:10:37,625
Who is on first.
That's the joke. It's comedy.

1138
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:39,689
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1139
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:41,029
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.

1140
01:10:41,101 --> 01:10:43,160
Every dollar of it. Yeah.

1141
01:10:43,237 --> 01:10:45,171
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1142
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:47,173
It's a routine
between Abbott and Costello.

1143
01:10:47,241 --> 01:10:50,301
When you do it, you're not funny.
You're Abbott and Abbott.

1144
01:10:50,377 --> 01:10:51,776
- Yeah.
- You understand me?

1145
01:10:51,845 --> 01:10:54,040
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1146
01:10:54,114 --> 01:10:55,376
Whose wife? Yeah.

1147
01:10:55,449 --> 01:10:57,610
- Ray? Ray? Ray?
- Yeah.

1148
01:10:57,684 --> 01:10:59,618
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.

1149
01:10:59,686 --> 01:11:02,314
You know why?
It's not a riddle.

1150
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:04,323
And if you understood that...

1151
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:07,758
if you understood that it's funny,
you might get better.

1152
01:11:07,828 --> 01:11:10,353
All I'm trying to find out
is what's the guy's name on first base.

1153
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:14,492
What's the guy's name on first base? No,
what's the guy's name on second base.

1154
01:11:14,568 --> 01:11:16,502
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1155
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,504
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1156
01:11:19,573 --> 01:11:21,973
You know the fella's name?
Yeah.

1157
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:23,976
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1158
01:11:24,044 --> 01:11:26,012
The fella playing first for St. Louie.
Who.

1159
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:28,047
The guy on first.
Who. The first baseman.

1160
01:11:28,115 --> 01:11:29,980
Who is on first.
What are you asking me for?

1161
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,450
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1162
01:11:32,519 --> 01:11:34,453
All right, Ray. Come on.

1163
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:36,785
We're gonna put the bed
by the window...

1164
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:41,089
we got your apple juice, we'll put
the pens and paper on the table.

1165
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:44,663
- Did I forget something?
- The cheeseballs.

1166
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:47,199
- Yes.
- Definitely have cheeseballs.

1167
01:11:47,267 --> 01:11:50,327
- I forgot the cheeseballs. We got 'em.
- I have to have 12 cheeseballs.

1168
01:11:50,404 --> 01:11:52,770
- [ Charlie ] Yes, definitely.
- Get my tartar-control toothpaste.

1169
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,865
We got that for you
a couple of days ago.

1170
01:11:54,942 --> 01:11:56,375
Where's my toothpaste?

1171
01:11:58,445 --> 01:11:59,707
Raymond.

1172
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:04,943
Remember that doctor asked you
those number questions today?

1173
01:12:05,018 --> 01:12:07,486
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

1174
01:12:07,554 --> 01:12:09,249
- I see it.
- Huh?

1175
01:12:09,323 --> 01:12:10,847
I see it.

1176
01:12:10,924 --> 01:12:12,892
What's that?
Will you stop for a second?

1177
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,393
I see it.

1178
01:12:14,461 --> 01:12:16,952
Put that down.
I'm trying to talk to you.

1179
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:19,294
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?

1180
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:22,335
Why do you always have to act
like an idiot?

1181
01:12:22,402 --> 01:12:24,768
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?

1182
01:12:24,838 --> 01:12:26,806
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.

1183
01:12:26,874 --> 01:12:28,842
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.

1184
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,342
Rinse.

1185
01:12:35,682 --> 01:12:39,083
Why'd you say--
Why'd you say funny teeth?

1186
01:12:39,152 --> 01:12:41,120
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1187
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:44,480
'Rain man'?
I said, 'Rain man'?

Kissed Susanna.

1787
01:58:47,283 --> 01:58:49,547
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.

1788
01:58:49,619 --> 01:58:52,679
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.

1789
01:58:52,755 --> 01:58:55,019
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.

1790
01:58:55,091 --> 01:58:56,558
- Wet?
- Yeah.

1791
01:58:56,626 --> 01:58:59,356
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

1792
01:58:59,428 --> 01:59:02,488
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.

1793
01:59:02,565 --> 01:59:04,658
- You drove?
- Yeah.

1794
01:59:04,734 --> 01:59:08,226
-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.

1795
01:59:08,304 --> 01:59:11,637
- He didn't drive the highway.
- Uh-huh.

1796
01:59:11,707 --> 01:59:14,369
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?

1797
01:59:14,443 --> 01:59:18,709
Well, things they tend to do when--
inflict bodily harm on themselves.

1798
01:59:18,781 --> 01:59:21,272
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

1799
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:24,945
He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.

1800
01:59:25,021 --> 01:59:27,888
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?

1801
01:59:27,957 --> 01:59:30,187
- This morning when--
- This morning?

1802
01:59:30,259 --> 01:59:33,854
This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.

1803
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:37,195
You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.

1804
01:59:37,266 --> 01:59:39,200
He got nervous,
but he's fine now.

1805
01:59:39,268 --> 01:59:41,600
Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.

1806
01:59:41,671 --> 01:59:44,265
We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.

1807
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:47,707
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.

1808
01:59:47,777 --> 01:59:50,610
- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.

1809
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,648
I'm not placing any blame--

1810
01:59:52,715 --> 01:59:55,809
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.

1811
01:59:55,885 --> 01:59:59,616
I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?

1812
01:59:59,689 --> 02:00:01,623
No one is saying anything.

1813
02:00:01,691 --> 02:00:04,489
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.

1814
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,994
- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.

1815
02:00:07,063 --> 02:00:09,896
- This is my family.
- I understand that.

1816
02:00:09,966 --> 02:00:13,766
Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.

1817
02:00:13,836 --> 02:00:18,398
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

1818
02:00:18,474 --> 02:00:21,705
You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.

1819
02:00:21,777 --> 02:00:24,541
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

1820
02:00:24,614 --> 02:00:26,548
There's some things
I'd like to go over.

1821
02:00:26,616 --> 02:00:30,245
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...

1822
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:33,186
and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?

1823
02:00:33,256 --> 02:00:35,087
My father died.
I was upset.

1824
02:00:35,157 --> 02:00:36,852
That was wrong.

1825
02:00:36,926 --> 02:00:40,327
Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...

1826
02:00:40,396 --> 02:00:42,956
and you want to
take care of him.

1827
02:00:43,032 --> 02:00:45,193
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

1828
02:00:45,268 --> 02:00:48,362
From the beginning
it was like a kidnapping.

1829
02:00:48,437 --> 02:00:51,235
Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.

1830
02:00:51,307 --> 02:00:54,970
But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

1831
02:00:55,044 --> 02:00:56,306
Yes.

1832
02:00:56,379 --> 02:00:58,643
- Look, that--
- Yes?

1833
02:00:58,714 --> 02:01:01,740
I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.

1834
02:01:01,817 --> 02:01:03,808
When it started out--

1835
02:01:03,886 --> 02:01:06,821
- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?

1836
02:01:06,889 --> 02:01:09,551
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

1837
02:01:09,625 --> 02:01:12,458
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.

1838
02:01:12,528 --> 02:01:14,928
No accusations?

1839
02:01:14,997 --> 02:01:18,023
[ Sighs ]
See, you have to understand...

1840
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:22,332
that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...

1841
02:01:22,405 --> 02:01:23,997
in name.

1842
02:01:27,843 --> 02:01:29,435
And then...

1843
02:01:32,581 --> 02:01:34,776
this morning we had pancakes.

1844
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:36,875
Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--

1845
02:01:36,952 --> 02:01:39,443
- Mm-hmm.
- Maple syrup on the table.

1846
02:01:39,522 --> 02:01:41,956
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1847
02:01:43,125 --> 02:01:44,387
See, we--

1848
02:01:46,195 --> 02:01:47,856
I made a connection.

1849
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:50,330
I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...

1850
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:53,800
but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...

1851
02:01:53,869 --> 02:01:56,667
whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...

1852
02:01:56,739 --> 02:02:00,334
and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.

1853
02:02:00,409 --> 02:02:01,774
I'm all for that.

1854
02:02:01,844 --> 02:02:05,007
- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.

1855
02:02:05,081 --> 02:02:07,015
[ Bruner ]
He can't decide for himself.

1856
02:02:07,083 --> 02:02:09,449
[ Charlie ] He's capable
of a lot more than you know.

1857
02:02:09,518 --> 02:02:11,884
[ Marston ]
Why don't we ask Raymond?

1858
02:02:11,954 --> 02:02:15,754
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?

1859
02:02:15,825 --> 02:02:18,555
- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?

1860
02:02:18,627 --> 02:02:20,060
Yeah.

1861
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:23,464
Do you wanna stay
with your brother?

1862
02:02:25,167 --> 02:02:28,466
Raymond, would you like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?

1863
02:02:28,537 --> 02:02:31,028
[ Charlie ]
The doctor's asking you a question.

1864
02:02:31,107 --> 02:02:33,234
- So you listen.
- Yeah.

1865
02:02:33,309 --> 02:02:37,302
Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?

1866
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:40,440
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1867
02:02:40,516 --> 02:02:42,575
- You do?
- Yeah.

1868
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:43,913
You wanna stay with your brother?

1869
02:02:43,986 --> 02:02:47,387
Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

1870
02:02:47,456 --> 02:02:49,924
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

1871
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:53,890
- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1872
02:02:57,266 --> 02:02:59,962
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.

1873
02:03:00,035 --> 02:03:03,095
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1874
02:03:03,172 --> 02:03:07,131
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

1875
02:03:07,209 --> 02:03:08,642
Yeah.

1876
02:03:09,979 --> 02:03:14,143
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1877
02:03:14,216 --> 02:03:16,116
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1878
02:03:16,185 --> 02:03:18,244
They're two separate things.

1879
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:22,154
Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.

1880
02:03:22,224 --> 02:03:25,751
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.

1881
02:03:25,828 --> 02:03:29,787
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?

1882
02:03:29,865 --> 02:03:32,299
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.

1883
02:03:32,368 --> 02:03:33,767
All right.

1884
02:03:33,836 --> 02:03:35,997
[ Charlie ]
Just hold on here.

1885
02:03:36,071 --> 02:03:37,663
All right.

1886
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:40,971
All right.
You made your point.

1887
02:03:41,043 --> 02:03:45,173
You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.

1888
02:03:45,247 --> 02:03:47,374
- It's over.
- Yeah.

1889
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:50,385
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

1890
02:03:50,453 --> 02:03:52,683
- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.

1891
02:03:53,722 --> 02:03:55,713
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

1892
02:03:58,527 --> 02:04:00,518
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?

1893
02:04:00,596 --> 02:04:02,393
Excuse me.

1894
02:04:10,506 --> 02:04:12,940
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

1895
02:04:14,777 --> 02:04:18,235
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1896
02:04:18,314 --> 02:04:19,576
No.

1897
02:04:20,649 --> 02:04:22,583
I don't know.

1898
02:04:27,957 --> 02:04:31,484
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1899
02:04:35,397 --> 02:04:38,127
- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.

1900
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:41,727
- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.

1901
02:04:43,072 --> 02:04:45,233
- What?
- My main man.

1902
02:04:49,812 --> 02:04:51,245
Listen.

1903
02:04:54,883 --> 02:04:58,148
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.

1904
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:04,050
Because you see, these--

1905
02:05:04,126 --> 02:05:08,392
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.

1906
02:05:09,298 --> 02:05:11,425
- You know?
- Yeah.

1907
02:05:13,068 --> 02:05:17,198
What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.

1908
02:05:18,273 --> 02:05:20,070
Connecting.

1909
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:25,779
- I like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.

1910
02:05:25,848 --> 02:05:28,749
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, you are.

1911
02:05:56,011 --> 02:05:58,639
I like having you
for my big brother.

1912
02:06:01,450 --> 02:06:02,712
Yeah.

1913
02:06:17,332 --> 02:06:19,664
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1914
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:25,399
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1915
02:06:26,608 --> 02:06:28,371
Main man.

1916
02:07:01,577 --> 02:07:03,704
[ Announcer ]
May I have your attention, please?

1917
02:07:03,779 --> 02:07:07,909
Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound...

1918
02:07:07,983 --> 02:07:10,076
now boarding, track number three.

1919
02:07:10,152 --> 02:07:13,588
- Fullerton, San Bernardino, Barstow...
- Ray.

1920
02:07:13,655 --> 02:07:17,955
Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.

1921
02:07:24,466 --> 02:07:25,899
- Hello, Charlie.
- Dr. Bruner.

1922
02:07:25,968 --> 02:07:27,230
Hello, Raymond.

1923
02:07:27,302 --> 02:07:29,998
Wouldn't you feel more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?

1924
02:07:30,072 --> 02:07:31,505
Tell him, Ray.

1925
02:07:31,573 --> 02:07:33,632
- Kmart sucks.
- I see.

1926
02:07:33,709 --> 02:07:37,907
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

1927
02:07:37,980 --> 02:07:41,541
Why don't you take a couple of minutes?
See you, Charlie.

1928
02:07:42,718 --> 02:07:45,653
- You made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

1929
02:07:50,425 --> 02:07:54,486
I guess I'd better give this to you.
You're gonna have to carry this now.

1930
02:07:55,998 --> 02:07:59,456
It's got your cheeseballs,
your apple juice...

1931
02:07:59,535 --> 02:08:01,503
notebooks, pens and...

1932
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:04,004
'Who's On First?' video
that you like.

1933
02:08:04,072 --> 02:08:07,132
- 'Who's On First?' is very funny.
- I told you it's funny.

1934
02:08:07,209 --> 02:08:08,699
Board!

1935
02:08:08,777 --> 02:08:11,871
- Better get goin'.

1936
02:08:11,947 --> 02:08:14,381
Yeah, it sure is.

1937
02:08:14,449 --> 02:08:17,646
Now listen, Ray.
Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.

1938
02:08:17,719 --> 02:08:20,517
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

1939
02:08:20,589 --> 02:08:23,387
I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.

1940
02:08:23,458 --> 02:08:26,291
- How many days is that?
- Fourteen days from today.

1941

- Today's Wednesday.

1942
02:08:29,431 --> 02:08:31,058
336 hours.

1943
02:08:31,133 --> 02:08:32,532
Mystifying.

1944
02:08:33,802 --> 02:08:36,100
'Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

1945
02:08:36,171 --> 02:08:41,074
1,209,600 seconds.

1946
02:08:41,143 --> 02:08:42,576
Ray?

1947
02:08:44,112 --> 02:08:45,204
Ray!

1948
02:08:46,215 --> 02:08:47,807
Ray!

1949
02:08:48,817 --> 02:08:50,341
Yeah.

1950
02:08:54,923 --> 02:08:56,356
I'll see you soon.

1951
02:08:56,425 --> 02:08:59,019
Yeah.
One for bad, two for good.

1952
02:09:03,165 --> 02:09:04,598
Bet two for good.

1953
02:09:04,666 --> 02:09:06,395
Yeah.

1954
02:09:16,778 --> 02:09:18,712
Three minutes to Wapner.

1955
02:09:20,349 --> 02:09:21,907
You'll make it.

1956
02:09:23,518 --> 02:09:25,110
Yeah.
