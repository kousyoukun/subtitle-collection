1
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:07,072
RAIN MAN

2
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,452
I've got four Lamborghinis
that can't meet smog emission standards.

3
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,652
How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?

4
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:14,027
Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.

5
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:16,497
Three times?
You're on a roll.

6
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,127
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.

7
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:21,762
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

8
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:24,102
I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...

9
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:27,337
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.

10
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,922
Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.

11
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,014
Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.

12
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:34,525
I'll explain that
to my swing loan.

13
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,495
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.

14
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:41,363
I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.

15
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:44,835
- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.

16
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:47,532
I got a shark snappin' at my heels.

17
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,098
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

18
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,610
I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.

19
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:55,146
I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.

20
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:58,342
This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...

21
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:02,252
and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my four cars off the road?

22
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,687
Babbitt Collectibles.

23
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:07,555
Have you tried cash?
How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?

24
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,595
Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.

25
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,823
- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing Loan.

26
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:15,425
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.

27
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:18,834
- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.

28
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:23,740
Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.

29
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,937
I need this.
Come on.

30
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:28,947
I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.

31
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,449
His number?
He's on the road now.

32
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,747
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--

33
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,550
Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:30 a.m.

34
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,090
- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.

35
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:42,150
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

36
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,028
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

37
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,227
Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...

38
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,361
and the E.P.A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.

39
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:54,429
- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm Listening.

40
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:58,068
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.

41
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:01,511
- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.

42
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:06,008
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Line.

43
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:09,452
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--

44
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:12,047
What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.

45
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,652
We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

46
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,663
And because of your
incredible patience...

47
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:23,293
we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.

48
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:25,963
Well, yes,
you've been most patient.

49
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,974
We really appreciate your patience.
Well, thank you.

50
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,033
Thank you.

51
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,914
Ready for Palm Springs?

52
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:38,177
You still want to go
with all these problems?

53
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:41,311
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

54
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:44,356
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- No, not bad at all.

55
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:47,358
- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.

56
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,360
I got it under control.

57
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:14,651
I don't want to be demanding...

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,589
but could you possibly say 10 or
12 words before we get to the hotel?

59
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,184
Consider it foreplay.

60
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:25,628
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

61
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,799
I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.

62
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:33,737
Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.

63
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:36,604
If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.

64
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,940
What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?

65
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:43,914
I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.

66
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:47,248
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?

67
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,916
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

68
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:55,222
One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?

69
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:58,559
I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.

70
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:01,623
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.

71
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:04,795
But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--

72
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,668
You wanna talk?
Let's talk!

73
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,039
This is not talking.

74
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,045
- Yeah?
- Charlie, this is Lenny.

75
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:16,809
I've been trying to contact you
for a while.

76
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:20,579
I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.

77
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:23,383
He's been trying to reach you.

78
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,947
Your father has died, Charlie.

79
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:32,361
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.

80
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,423
- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.

81
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,560
Anything else?

82
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,834
- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.

83
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:47,244
- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?

84
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:51,147
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a Long time ago.

85
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:54,277
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

86
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:57,618
We just didn't get along.

87
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,056
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.

88
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:04,790
- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.

89
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,422
I want to.

90
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:10,230
All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to.

91
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,913
...to our beloved neighbor...

92
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:32,788
for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...

93
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:36,316
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

94
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:41,196
Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for Life...

95
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,735
dedication to family...

96
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:46,897
and charity to all.

97
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:50,772
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection Life...

98
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:55,212
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.

99
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,949
Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.

100
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,689
I can wait in the car.

101
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:51,238
Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.

102
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:55,244
Knew this car my whole Life.
Only drove it once.

103
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:59,749
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.

104
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:02,285
Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.

105
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:06,790
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

106
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,325
Know it by rote.

107
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,843
You were his only child.

108
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,345
You came along when he was...

109
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:32,075
what, 45 or something?

110
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,947
He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...

111
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,317
so he had to love you.

112
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:41,290
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.

113
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:45,226
In these pictures here, he doesn't look
Like a man who doesn't love his son.

114
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:48,629
What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.

115
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,792
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.

116
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:54,531
You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.

117
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,733
- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.

118
00:10:57,808 --> 00:11:00,902
'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'

119
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:03,276
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...

120
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:06,043
I bring home a report card,
and it's almost all A's.

121
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,710
I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'

122
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:12,278
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

123
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:16,315
He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

124
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:20,295
You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?

125
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:23,060
Because l--
I deserved it.

126
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:26,500
Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?

127
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,334
We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.

128
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:31,840
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

129
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,343
Pulled over.

130
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:38,142
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

131
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:41,707
Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.

132
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,846
Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'

133
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:48,517
Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.

134
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:51,618
- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?

135
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,129
Two days.

136
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:57,031
Were you scared?

137
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,569
Yeah, I was scared.

138
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,672
Left home.
I never saw him again.

139
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,436
Charlie, after a year
we've been together...

140
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,943
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

141
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,707
It's strange, huh?

142
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,716
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

143
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:18,619
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

144
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:22,089
The rain what?

145
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,822
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

146
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:29,332
- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.

147
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:33,461
Not so much.

148
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:36,505
'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...

149
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:39,441
so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.

150
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,569
So full of yourself.

151
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,113
And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...

152
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,308
is understandable as well.

153
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:50,342
Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...

154
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,048
all these I forgive.

155
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:55,353
But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my Life in any way...

156
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:58,156
has left me without a son.

157
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:02,187
I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.'

158
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:11,271
'l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...

159
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,276
that certain Buick convertible...

160
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:18,179
the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

161
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:22,378
Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.

162
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,387
May they remind him
of the value of excellence...

163
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,889
and the possibility of perfection.

164
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:29,790
As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...

165
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,023
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...

166
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,260
that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'

167
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,028
What does that mean?

168
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:41,697
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...

169
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:46,436
after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...

170
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,070
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

171
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:52,115
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

172
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:55,583
- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.

173
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:58,816
What is that?
How does that work?

174
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,756
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.

175
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,726
I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.

176
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,730
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?

177
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,959
What's his name got--

178
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:12,059
- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.

179
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:15,003
He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.

180
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:17,063
I definitely got
the rose bushes.

181
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:19,837
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.

182
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,708
- There's no need--
- To what?

183
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,975
To be upset?

184
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,415
To be upset?

185
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:30,146
If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...

186
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,486
and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.

187
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:37,322
Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?

188
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,761
- Were you Listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.

189
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:43,095
Were you?

190
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:47,194
No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

191
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,669
I was looking for you.

192
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:55,678
How did it go?

193
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,214
I got what I expected.

194
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,959
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.

195
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:36,881
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.

196
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:41,391
I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.

197
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,653
- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.

198
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,838
Is this Wallbrook?

199
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:57,840
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?

200
00:15:57,908 --> 00:16:00,001
Excuse me.

201
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,012
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

202
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:11,020
Would you Like
to wait in his office?

203
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:13,522
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.

204
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:30,872
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.

205
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:50,857
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.

206
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,556
Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.

207
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,499
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?

208
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:00,833
- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.

209
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:03,395
I'd Like to watch
the TV, please.

210
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:07,466
For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?

211
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,307
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.

212
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,779
Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.

213
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,783
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

214
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:17,514
In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

215
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,646
Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.

216
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:49,151
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

217
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,653
I knew your father
since you were two years old.

218
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,383
The year my mother died.

219
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:56,688
I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.

220
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,354
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.

221
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,695
I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.

222
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,860
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?

223
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:09,167
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...

224
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,730
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

225
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:15,073
And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.

226
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:18,012
I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...

227
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:20,015
help me understand
the right in what he's done.

228
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,177
Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...

229
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:26,017
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

230
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:28,591
I'm sorry,
this is not your car.

231
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,150
Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.

232
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:34,129
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?

233
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:38,133
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

234
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,659
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.

235
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,330
Of course, today's Monday.

236
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,342
I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.

237
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,038
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

238
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,546
- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.

239
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:55,449
Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.

240
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,215
Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.

241
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:01,746
- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.

242
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:04,123
Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.

243
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:06,662
Now they're pitiful red.

244
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,164
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

245
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,961
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

246
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:17,998
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.

247
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,238
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

248
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,779
Only 8,095 production models.

249
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,372
Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.

250
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,384
- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?

251
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:30,886
- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?

252
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:34,549
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

253
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:37,718
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!

254
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:39,785
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

255
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:43,321
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.

256
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,063
Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?

257
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:49,697
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'

258
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,832
I wanna ask you a question.

259
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:54,514
What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--

260
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:57,448
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.

261
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:59,747
Bruner, who is this guy?

262
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,084
Raymond is your brother.

263
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,990
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

264
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,722
...and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:

265
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:12,697
'The People's Court.'

266
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:15,257
'The People's Court.'

267
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,470
'The People's Court.'

268
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,776
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'

269
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:28,781
- What is he, crazy?
- No.

270
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,316
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

271
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:33,615
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

272
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,621
I don't know what that means.

273
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:38,180
People Like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'

274
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:41,125
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

275
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:43,389
- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.

276
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:46,990
- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?

277
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:50,298
It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...

278
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,361
and how it's processed.

279
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,873
English here.
You're talkin' over my head.

280
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:57,239
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

281
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,245
He can't even express himself
or probably even...

282
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:02,577
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

283
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:09,481
And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.

284
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:12,081
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

285
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,094
Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.

286
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:17,562
Rituals. That's a good one.

287
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:20,395
Well, it's the way he acts...

288
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:24,403
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.

289
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:28,464
- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How Long has he been here?

290
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,909
- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?

291
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:34,572
He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.

292
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:37,344
- You've been here that Long?
- That's when I started.

293
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:41,148
So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.

294
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:44,213
You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.

295
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:48,125
- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?

296
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:51,596
- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?

297
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,827
I don't know.

298
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:00,165
Does he know how much money
he's been left?

299
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,401
No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

300
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,240
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

301
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:09,578
He's just inherited $3 million...

302
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:12,482
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

303
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:16,818
Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?

304
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,018
Good ol' Dad.

305
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:24,130
What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

306
00:22:24,197 --> 00:22:27,428
Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?

307
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:29,492
Why is he doin' that?

308
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:32,595
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'

309
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:34,606
- Yeah, why?
- Why?

310
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:37,507
It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.

311
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:42,071
- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.

312
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:44,583
- Ted Kloszevski.
- Kluszewski.

313
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,279
Ted Kluszewski. 'Big Klu.'
First base.

314
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:49,948
- He played for Cincinnati.
- Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.

315
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:54,119
- Lifetime batting average, .298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?

316
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:57,095
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

317
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:03,493
Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people
are gonna be here all day, Vern.

318
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,970
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

319
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,805
-This is definitely not a weekend visit.
-He's gettin' anxious.

320
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:13,039
- It's okay, Ray.
- Vern.

321
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:15,946
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

322
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:18,644
- He said not to touch the books!
- Not to touch books.

323
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,913
- You Like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

324
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:23,285
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?

325
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:25,756
- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.

326
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:27,817
- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?

327
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:30,124
- Stop it!
- Yes.

328
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:34,930
You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?

329
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,026
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

330
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:38,229
Maybe you'd better put it back.

331
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,270
You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.

332
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:46,608
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

333
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,774
It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.

334
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,149
Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.

335
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,620
It's okay, Ray.

336
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,680
- My main man.
- My main man.

337
00:23:57,757 --> 00:24:02,888
Here are your cards. I didn't know
where you wanted me to put them.

338
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:06,797
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

339
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:11,836
That's his way of showing he likes you.

340
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:14,738
But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.

341
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,971
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.

342
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:22,572
I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.

343
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:27,052
If I left town tomorrow and
didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.

344
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,054
He wouldn't notice?

345
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:32,888
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

346
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:35,792
Ray, you wanna go take a walk?

347
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,893
Can he hear us
when he's Like that?

348
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:45,199
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

349
00:24:45,272 --> 00:24:47,672
There's 27 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

350
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:50,369
Don't worry.
We'll bring you right back.

351
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:53,207
Practically 26 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

352
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,249
- We'll bring him right back.
- Twenty-six minutes.

353
00:24:56,316 --> 00:24:58,648
I won't do it.

354
00:24:58,718 --> 00:25:03,621
First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--

355
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,184
You're upset. Raymond,
I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.

356
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:12,027
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

357
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:15,295
No. Just stay there.

358
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:22,637
Just stay there.
Just stand still, okay? That's good.

359
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:26,543
I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do--

360
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:28,446
What?

361
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:31,245
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there...

362
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:34,651
and wait for you again
at the gate?

363
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:37,053
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

364
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:39,057
The car disturbs him.

365
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,253
- That's why?
- That's why.

366
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:44,629
Okay, Raymond.

367
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:58,073
What are you lookin' at?
The ducks are over here.

368
00:25:58,144 --> 00:25:59,907
I don't know.

369
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:06,542
Listen, our father died last week.

370
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,610
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

371
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:12,385
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

372
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,529
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

373
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:19,963
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.

374
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:23,400
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.

375
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,200
I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.

376
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:35,611
- Go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.

377
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:38,173
- We don't have to go today.
- Monday, no games scheduled.

378
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:42,654
I just thought maybe you'd Like
to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

379
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:45,816
He pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.

380
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:48,326
- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

381
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:50,863
- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.

382
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,660
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

383
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,894
Come on, Ray.

384
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,367
It's a Long way
to California...

385
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:03,170
and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.

386
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:05,768
Have to be back in two hours.

387
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:09,645
The people, crowds cheering.
You'll love it.

388
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:52,712
- This is the presidential suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

389
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:54,252
Here is Raymond's room.

390
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,154
- Look at this beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.

391
00:28:58,224 --> 00:29:01,159
- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.

392
00:29:01,227 --> 00:29:04,390
Little guy! This is gonna be terrific.
We're brothers.

393
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:08,491
- Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.
- When did he say--

394
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:12,334
I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have that for dessert.

395
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:14,999
We can do that.
I'm gonna call Lenny.

396
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:17,907
This is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.

397
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:21,208
- The bed's in the wrong place.
- You can move it.

398
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:24,682
- Where do you want the bed?
- Should be near the window.

399
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:28,744
Of course, I don't have my books.
Of course, there's no bookshelves.

400
00:29:28,821 --> 00:29:31,847
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be book-less.

401
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:35,827
Here's a book, a big telephone book.
A lot of words.

402
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:37,863
Pick up, Lenny.

403
00:29:37,931 --> 00:29:42,368
I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,
and he doesn't answer the phone.

404
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:45,233
- 6:00 here means it's 9:00 there.
- It's 3:00 there.

405
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,567
6:30 p.m. is dinner.

406
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:49,574
It's 3:00 there.
He doesn't wanna answer the phone?

407
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:51,576
Orange soda.

408
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:54,704
Has to be in a can with a straw.

409
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:58,148
Bruner told you
that you should do this?

410
00:29:58,218 --> 00:30:00,652
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.

411
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:23,064
V-E-R-N!

412
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:26,578
Oh, God.
Go see what he's doin'.

413
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,176
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!

414
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,514
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

415
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:35,850
Everything is fine.
Charlie, let's take him home.

416
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:39,016
He's okay.
Just get him some dinner.

417
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:41,083
Did you say you wanted hamburger?

418
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,219
Hamburger, Ray?

419
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:46,925
- We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.
- Pizza?

420
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,731
- You get pizza in the institution?
- Monday night's Italian night.

421
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:54,170
- Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu.

422
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,643
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- I've got a bit of a legal problem.

423
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:01,407
He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.

424
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:03,847
All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.

425
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:12,890
- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. We're allowed.

426
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:18,328
'Wheel of Fortune'!

427
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,357
Look at this studio filled with
glamorous merchandise...

428
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:24,903
fabulous and exciting
bonus prizes.

429
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:29,408
A pair of cars for today's busy couple.

430
00:31:29,475 --> 00:31:32,501
Thousands of dollars in cash.

431
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:37,982
Over $150,000
just waiting to be won...

432
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:41,578
as we present
our big bonanza of cash...

433
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:45,488
on 'Wheel Of Fortune'!

434
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:49,927
I'd Like to order a large pizza.
Pepperoni, right?

435
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:51,361
I don't want pepperoni.

436
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:55,527
Yeah, a large pepperoni.
How Long is that gonna take?

437
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:59,435
Bring some beer up and orange soda.
You got tapioca pudding?

438
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:02,770
- No, sir, we don't.
- Just bring the closest thing.

439
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:08,211
Ray, take this.
Food is coming shortly.

440
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,272
I'll be right back.

441
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:17,548
Of course, I'm gonna be here
for a Long time, a very Long time.

442
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:20,916
I'm gone for good,
gone for good from my home.

443
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:32,747
- Si! Si!
- Si.

444
00:33:52,141 --> 00:33:54,132
What is that?

445
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,043
I think Raymond is in the room.

446
00:33:57,113 --> 00:33:59,741
- Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie Babbitt.

447
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:03,080
Well, get out!
Get out!

448
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:05,086
- Go!
- Stop it.

449
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:11,192
- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.

450
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,728
- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?

451
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:17,254
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.

452
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,267
Go in there.

453
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:27,142
Raymond, what were you doin' in my room?
What were you doin' in my room?

454
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:29,609
- I don't know.
- You don't know what you were doin'?

455
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:33,011
-Of course, there were noises.
-Those noises are none of your business.

456
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:35,346
You understand that?

457
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:37,908
Stop actin' Like an idiot
and go to sleep.

458
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:40,285
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sleep!

459
00:34:40,356 --> 00:34:42,415
- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11:00.

460
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:45,949
- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.

461
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,399
You don't listen to me.

462
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:04,344
- What are you talkin' about?
- I asked you to apologize.

463
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:08,509
- You went there and insulted him again.
- I'm not his mother.

464
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:10,677
Charlie, you're his brother!

465
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:13,221
They tell you today
that you have a brother...

466
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,985
and I don't see in your face
one little reaction.

467
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:19,755
- I'm not saying joy.
- You don't know what I'm goin' through.

468
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,820
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

469
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:24,991
You don't tell me anything.

470
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:27,831
- You just give me lies!
- What lies?

471
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:32,067
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

472
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:35,338
I know it's not true.
So tell me, why is he here?

473
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:36,776
- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?

474
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:40,337
- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?

475
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,510
- 'Cause I got him and they want him!
- This makes no sense!

476
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:45,952
- Raymond was left all the money.
- How much?

477
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,149
- $3 million. Every penny of it.
- So?

478
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:51,352
I'm gonna keep him
'til I get my half!

479
00:35:54,597 --> 00:35:57,657
What is this, huh?
Susanna?

480
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,234
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.

481
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:04,101
- What does that mean?
- I'm leaving.

482
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:07,199
You're leaving me now?
I need you!

483
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,801
You need nobody.

484
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,278
What does that mean?

485
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:15,215
Just take it easy!
What is my crime here?

486
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:17,844
Your crime is
that you use people!

487
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,879
- You're using Raymond, you're using me.
- I'm using Raymond?

488
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:24,949
Raymond, am I using you?

489
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:28,860
Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half hour ago!

490
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:30,865
What good is $3 million to him?

491
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:34,733
That money is only gonna sit there,
and I need that money.

492
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:39,069
You need it, so it's not Like stealing.
And then what happens to Raymond?

493
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:43,077
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or I'll put him in a better place.

494
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:46,546
- He is gonna be just the same.
- Only you have his money.

495
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:50,949
His money? That man was my father too.
Where's my fuckin' half?

496
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,648
- I'm entitled to that money!
- You kidnapped this man!

497
00:36:53,722 --> 00:36:56,850
I did not take him.
I took my half.

498
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,894
- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.

499
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:04,422
You're soaking wet and you're gonna
Leave in the middle of the night. Wait.

500
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,936
My father stuck it to me all my Life.
What do you want from me?

501
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:10,096
I want out.

502
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,282
- Stop that.
- Good morning.

503
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,193
- Coffee?
- That'd be good.

504
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:12,599
Dibbs, Sally.
461-0192.

505
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:15,159
How did you know
my phone number?

506
00:38:16,038 --> 00:38:17,471
How'd you know that?

507
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:21,737
You said read the telephone book.
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

508
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:26,512
He remembers things,
little things, sometimes.

509
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:30,211
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

510
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:33,152
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

511
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:35,417
Did you memorize the whole book?

512
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:38,426
- How far did you get?
- 'G.'

513
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:40,792
'G.' Gottsaken, William Marshall.

514
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:43,661
- You memorized to 'G'?
- Yeah, 'G.'

515
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:48,260
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of 'G.'

516
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:52,638
That's good, Ray.
I Like that.

517
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,373
- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.

518
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:02,178
- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.

519
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:04,742
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

520
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,688
They got pancakes.

521
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:12,989
- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.

522
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,325
You don't need toothpicks.

523
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:18,696
That was okay in the hotel with pizza,
but in a restaurant you use a fork.

524
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,258
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.

525
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:23,463
The pancakes
will keep sliding off.

526
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:27,100
I don't have my maple syrup either.
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.

527
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:29,371
You don't see any pancakes,
do you?

528
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:31,743
Of course,
maple syrup is not here.

529
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:35,716
Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

530
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:38,878
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.

531
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:40,387
We haven't ordered yet.

532
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:43,721
Maple syrup after the pancakes
is definitely too late.

533
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:48,525
How is that gonna be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

534
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:51,964
If we're gonna be here all morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...

535
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:55,970
I'm definitely not gonna
have my pancakes with--

536
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,302
Don't make a scene.

537
00:39:58,373 --> 00:40:01,240
Stop actin' Like a fuckin' retard.

538
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:24,932
What are you writing?

539
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,935
What the fuck is this?

540
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:32,874
'Serious'-- 'Serious injury list:
Charlie Babbitt'?

541
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:35,842
'Serious injury list'?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

542
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:39,278
Number 18 in 1988.

543
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:43,313
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988.

544
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:46,013
'Squeezed and pulled and hurt
your neck in 1988'?

545
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,624
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.

546
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:52,159
Where are you, son?

547
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:54,491
That's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.

548
00:40:54,563 --> 00:40:57,293
You have to bring him back,
Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?

549
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:58,492
No problem.

550
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:01,764
That will be $1.5 million.
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.

551
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,270
Don't touch that.

552
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:06,398
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.

553
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:08,875
Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.

554
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,377
He belongs here.

555
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:13,608
I'm his brother.
It's not Like kidnapping here, is it?

556
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:16,708
He's always been a voluntary patient
here, but that's beside the point.

557
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:19,845
This is where he can get
the best care.

558
00:41:19,922 --> 00:41:22,083
We're talking about his well-being.

559
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:24,785
Yeah. Let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

560
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,828
I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

561
00:41:26,895 --> 00:41:30,194
If you won't cut a deal with me,
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...

562
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:32,199
I'll stick him in an institution
out there...

563
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:35,725
and we can have
a custody battle over him.

564
00:41:35,804 --> 00:41:37,533
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

565
00:41:37,606 --> 00:41:39,699
Could you get him some?
Thank you.

566
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,800
Now, you wanna battle me
in the courts?

567
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:45,142
You think about that, Dr. Bruner.
Think about that.

568
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:47,181
Or we can cut a deal right now.

569
00:41:47,282 --> 00:41:50,740
I don't think you have any idea
of the severity of Raymond's condition.

570
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:52,582
Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.

571
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:55,680
Can we just get him
some toothpicks?

572
00:41:55,757 --> 00:41:58,123
I cannot make
money deals with you.

573
00:41:58,193 --> 00:42:00,127
Then I'll see you in court.

574
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:07,698
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

575
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:10,237
82, 82, 82.

576
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:12,000
82 what, Ray?

577
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:14,508
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

578
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:18,612
That's more than 82 toothpicks.

579
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,843
246 total.

580
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,248
Keep the change.

581
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,913
How many toothpicks are in there?

582
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:30,220
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

583
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:31,782
246.

584
00:42:33,462 --> 00:42:35,225
There's four left in the box.

585
00:42:36,798 --> 00:42:38,891
I have to get my backpack.

586
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:44,463
97X.

587
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,030
The future of rock and roll.

588
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,805
97X.

589
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:53,277
The future of rock and roll.

590
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:57,680
97X.

591
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,446
The future of rock and roll.

592
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:08,655
The future of rock and roll.

593
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,719
Ray.

594
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,766
Enough already.
Change the channel.

595
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:16,631
The future of rock and roll.

596
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,005
Lenny, I don't care what you think.
Did they say that?

597
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:28,276
You're gonna have to be
more forceful with them.

598
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,875
Lenny, are you--
Lenny, shut up a moment.

599
00:43:30,952 --> 00:43:33,785
I am in serious trouble.
I can't get to these cars.

600
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,914
I can't get the money.
Do you understand that?

601
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,653
- My Loan is past due.
- I'll call the Loan officer...

602
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:40,888
tell him we have
a little problem.

603
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:45,330
- Listen, Charlie, let me talk--
- Lenny, just listen to me.

604
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,425
I'll be in LAX
in three hours, okay?

605
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:51,404
Now, remember, the Buick
is in A-3, main terminal.

606
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:54,442
Make sure they pick it up.
All right? See you in a few.

607
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,678
Will Dr. Andrew Baker...

608
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:05,379
please pick up
a white courtesy phone?

609
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:07,388
- Dr. Andrew Baker.
- Raymond, let's go.

610
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:12,222
Ray, let's go. Come on.

611
00:44:14,596 --> 00:44:17,326
- What were you watching?
- I don't know.

612
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:18,696
You don't know?

613
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:22,225
Final call for flight 1559...

614
00:44:22,304 --> 00:44:25,928
service to Salt Lake City
and Los Angeles.

615
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:29,855
There's an airplane out there.

616
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:31,957
That's right,
and everybody's boarding. Let's go.

617
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:33,969
- Airline travel's very dangerous.
- Don't be silly.

618
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:36,437
It's the safest travel in the world.
You'll love this. Trust me.

619
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,730
Now come on.

620
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,608
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

621
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,239
- Why do you think we're here?
- Flying's very dangerous.

622
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,249
In 1987, there were
30 airline accidents.

623
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:51,514
211 were fatalities
and 230 were definitely passengers.

624
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:53,521
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

625
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:55,784
I gotta get to L.A.
I don't have time for this shit.

626
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:58,486
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

627
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:00,153
- You don't know?
- No.

628
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:02,356
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.

629
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:06,664
Okay, fine. We can--
There's an American plane.

630
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:08,465
American flight 625...

631
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:11,063
crashed April 27, 1976.

632
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,367
We don't have to take American.
There's a lot of flights.

633
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:15,706
Pick another airline.

634
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:20,147
- Continental. We'll take Continental.
- Continental crashed November 15, 1987.

635
00:45:20,216 --> 00:45:22,684
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

636
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:25,820
- This is very serious.
- Yeah, very serious.

637
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:29,380
I have to get to Los Angeles.
So you're gonna get on that plane.

638
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:30,983
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

639
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,290
- You have to get on a plane.
- Yeah.

640
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:37,228
Now, there's a Delta.

641
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,495
- Yeah.
- It leaves at midnight.

642
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:40,695
How's Delta?

643
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,262
Delta crashed August 2, 1985.
Lockheed L-1011.

644
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,331
Dallas-Fort Worth.
Terrible wind shear.

645
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:48,604
- All airlines--
- 135 passengers.

646
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:51,078
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

647
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,115
That doesn't mean
that they are not safe.

648
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:54,911
- Quantas.
- Quantas?

649
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:56,542
Quantas never crashed.

650
00:45:57,653 --> 00:45:59,587
- Quantas?
- Never crashed.

651
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:02,785
- Well, that's--
- Never crashed.

652
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,793
That's gonna do me
a lot of good.

653
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:07,295
Quantas doesn't fly to L.A.
out of Cincinnati.

654
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:09,831
- You have got to get to Melbourne...
- Australia.

655
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:12,231
in order to get the plane
that flies to Los Angeles.

656
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:13,996
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

657
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,765
- 16.2 million population.
- Let's go.

658
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:17,169
Very lovely beaches.

659
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,141
We're getting on this plane!

660
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:26,304
Ray! Ray! Ray!

661
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:33,081
We're not gonna take the plane.
He's okay. He's okay!

662
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:35,147
We're not gonna take the plane.

663
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,885
Just relax.
He was upset.

664
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:41,953
We were gonna take the plane.
We're not gonna take it now.

665
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:44,659
- We're not gonna fly, okay?
- No flying.

666
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:50,235
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

667
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:53,341
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

668
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,502
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles.

669
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,580
Okay? Come on, Ray.

670
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:00,138
Ray? Come on.

671
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:01,979
- Yeah.
- Come here.

672
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:03,985
- No flying.
- We're not taking the plane.

673
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:06,112
- Just grab the fuckin' bag.
- No flying.

674
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,859
You're killin' me, Ray.
I just want you to know.

675
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,861
- No flying.
- I gotta be in L.A. in three hours.

676
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:14,897
It's gonna take me three days.

677
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:16,363
Come on!

678
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:20,634
No flying.

679
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:22,295
- No flying.
- No flying.

680
00:47:24,473 --> 00:47:27,169
I got 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

681
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:29,575
- I watch 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.
- Don't start with that.

682
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:31,579
'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

683
00:48:06,115 --> 00:48:08,777
- Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.
- Go ahead, 1-0-9.

684
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:11,479
Can you get another unit here
for point control?

685
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:14,022
Two more over to you. 10-40.

686
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:17,586
Let's go!

687
00:48:20,162 --> 00:48:22,187
- Bring some more up.
- What's your E.T.A.?

688
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:26,526
Ray?

689
00:48:27,436 --> 00:48:29,495
Get in the car.

690
00:48:30,439 --> 00:48:32,600
Get in the car.
Are you crazy?

691
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,506
We'll be outta this in a second.

692
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:36,067
- Yeah.
- That's good.

693
00:48:36,145 --> 00:48:38,272
It's okay. That's right.

694
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:41,180
Yeah. We'll be outta here
in a few seconds. That's good.

695
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,583
- That's good. That's good.
- There's a fatal accident over there.

696
00:48:46,355 --> 00:48:48,846
We don't need your help.
Go back to your car.

697
00:48:48,924 --> 00:48:51,051
Just a minute!

698
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,258
Son of a bitch! Ray?

699
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:00,032
Excuse-- Hey--

700
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:02,093
- Just wait--
- There's nothing to see here.

701
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:04,435
- Go back to your car.
- Yes, sir.

702
00:49:04,507 --> 00:49:06,907
- Wrecks make him nervous.
- Get in your car.

703
00:49:06,976 --> 00:49:09,536
Yes, sir. Just stay there
by the side, okay, Raymond?

704
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:11,637
- Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

705
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:14,080
Yeah.
Definitely a lot of traffic.

706
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:17,085
A lot of work for $3 million.

707
00:49:17,153 --> 00:49:19,781
I'd Like to Leave him on the highway
and get outta here.

708
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:22,551
What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

709
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:30,058
- Memorial Hospital is ready--
- Stay in your car!

710
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:39,107
What's it gonna be, Ray?

711
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,143
This is
a very dangerous highway.

712
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,677
How will I get to L.A.?

713
00:49:42,745 --> 00:49:45,305
Driving a car on this interstate
is very dangerous.

714
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:47,474
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

715
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,780
- Yeah.
- Well, you gotta get in the car...

716
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:51,786
in order to get off the highway!

717
00:49:51,854 --> 00:49:54,789
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers
were involved in fatal accidents.

718
00:49:57,827 --> 00:49:59,920
I got a great idea.

719
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:02,691
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.

720
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:06,531
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

721
00:50:06,602 --> 00:50:08,035
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

722
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:10,368
Give me five, Ray.
That's a great idea.

723
00:50:10,439 --> 00:50:13,135
Give me five. Yeah.
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

724
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:24,215
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.

725
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:26,914
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

726
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,549
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

727
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:30,785
Who is on first.

728
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:34,026
Whose wife? Yes.

729
00:50:34,096 --> 00:50:36,360
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

730
00:50:36,432 --> 00:50:37,364
Absolutely.

731
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:40,061
All I'm tryin' to find out
is what the guy's name on first base.

732
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:42,070
No, what is on second base.

733
00:50:42,138 --> 00:50:44,868
I'm not asking you who's on second base?
Who's on first?

734
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,238
- That's what I'm tryin' to find out.
- Get in the car!

735
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:49,539
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

736
00:50:49,612 --> 00:50:52,706
Get in the car. Yeah.
I have to be in bed by 11:00.

737
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:55,250
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

738
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:03,452
Now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

739
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:05,585
We have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out.

740
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:07,595
We're not flying.
We're not on the interstate.

741
00:51:07,663 --> 00:51:10,496
I'm on some shit secondary road.
I gotta make up time.

742
00:51:10,566 --> 00:51:12,557
I should've been in Los Angeles
this afternoon.

743
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:14,500
My business needs me.
I gotta make up time.

744
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,267
Definitely watch TV, but be
in bed by 11:00. Lights out.

745
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,534
Forget it.

746
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:21,542
19 minutes to 11:00.

747
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:38,559
This is a good one.
'We don't go out when it rains.'

748
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:41,061
This is a good one.
I hope you appreciate this...

749
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,530
because my business
is going down the toilet.

750
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,226
I should be in L.A.

751
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:49,294
Instead I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel
in Bumblefuck, Missouri...

752
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:51,464
because you won't
go out when it rains.

753
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,634
It's mystifying. It really is.
Fuckin' mystifying.

754
00:51:58,347 --> 00:52:01,043
What is this?
Good news, bad news?

755
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:03,985
We passed D.O.T.
but failed E.P.A. again.

756
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:06,146
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

757
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:09,623
Well, yes, sir. I'm just stuck
in Cincinnati since the funeral.

758
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:12,627
So many leftover details.
My family is...

759
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:14,788
needless to say,
quite overwhelmed.

760
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:17,094
Yeah, well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

761
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,293
It is a shock, to say the least.

762
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:23,465
Thank you. Can I get
an extension on that Loan?

763
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:26,508
A couple of days
would make a big difference.

764
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:36,617
'We don't go out when it's raining.'

765
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:42,990
What? Speak up, Lenny.

766
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:44,992
I didn't buy that kind of time.

767
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,028
I want you to go down--
How much?

768
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:48,324
- It's 12:30.
- What?

769
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:49,830
Lunch is 12:30.

770
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:52,265
- Hold on. What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

771
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:54,199
- Fish sticks?
- Green lime Jell-O for dessert.

772
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,137
Green lime Jell-O.
Want another apple juice?

773
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,936
I want orange soda.
Oh, it's 12:31.

774
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,943
I gotta go.
He's startin' to rock and moan.

775
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:04,445
- 12:32. Definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

776
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:06,640
- Give me that gun.
- Where is he?

777
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,278
Where is he?

778
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:11,319
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

779
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:14,379
'Frame'? Where is he?

780
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:16,515
- There's four fish sticks.
- Huh?

781
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:19,026
There's supposed to be eight.
There's only four.

782
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:20,857
There's eight.

783
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,160
You take a shower, Ray?

784
00:53:23,232 --> 00:53:26,531
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

785
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:29,230
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

786
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:31,739
What do you say, Ray?

787
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:33,775
'Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

788
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:36,673
That's the end
of that conversation.

789
00:53:37,813 --> 00:53:39,747
- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200.

790
00:53:39,815 --> 00:53:44,616
The answer: 'Shakespeare wrote
over 150 poems in this 14-line form.'

791
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:46,655
- What is a sonnet?
- What is a sonnet?

792
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:48,656
- You got it.
- Double letters for 200.

793
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:53,093
The top of that one. 'The last word
in the Pledge of Allegiance.' Mark.

794
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:54,527
- What is 'stands'?
- No.

795
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:56,030
Stu, Stu, Stu.

796
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:59,932
Legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

797
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:04,833
He didn't figure anyone would show up
to contest his authority.

798
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:08,206
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody...

799
00:54:08,277 --> 00:54:10,211
and the $3 million, right?

800
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:14,739
And you set up a date-- Yeah, you set up
a date for the custody hearing.

801
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:17,285
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

802
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:19,844
I found that it wasn't
an original record...

803
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:22,083
because the original song
had two verses--

804
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:25,593
She hasn't come in?
She hasn't called?

805
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:28,630
If you hear from her, tell her
to call me at this number.

806
00:54:41,343 --> 00:54:44,005
The Air Alpha Force,
from Nike.

807
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:50,476
Look at that.
1957 Studebaker Goldenhawk.

808
00:54:50,552 --> 00:54:52,042
0 to 60 in under 8 seconds.

809
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:54,589
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

810
00:54:54,657 --> 00:54:57,148
- It's beautiful.
- 'Course, I'm an excellent driver.

811
00:54:57,226 --> 00:54:59,160
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

812
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,391
When did you drive?

813
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:04,398
I drove the Buick on the driveway
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

814
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:08,466
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

815
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:09,663
Yeah.

816
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:14,275
- He let you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, slow on the driveway.

817
00:55:16,378 --> 00:55:18,573
We'll have to let you
drive sometime.

818
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:24,450
You never touch this steering wheel
when I'm driving! Do you hear me?

819
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,646
- Yeah.
- Do you hear me?

820
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:28,622
- I don't have my underwear.
- What?

821
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,625
I'm definitely not wearing
my underwear.

822
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:33,787
-I gave you a pair of mine this morning.
-They're not my underwear.

823
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,494
I told you to put 'em on.
Where are they?

824
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:39,659
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

825
00:55:39,735 --> 00:55:41,032
- Where?
- Here.

826
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:44,599
- These are too tight.
- I don't want them back.

827
00:55:44,673 --> 00:55:47,301
- Mine are boxer shorts.
- What's the difference?

828
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:50,140
- These are Hanes 32.
- Underwear is underwear.

829
00:55:50,212 --> 00:55:52,271
My boxer shorts have my name.
It says 'Raymond.'

830
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:55,475
All right. When we pass a store,
we'll pick up some boxer shorts.

831
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:58,418
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

832
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:00,751
We're not going back.
Don't start with that.

833
00:56:00,823 --> 00:56:02,791
- 400 Oak Street.
- We're not going back.

834
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:05,053
You don't have to go
to Cincinnati for boxer shorts.

835
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:07,527
- Oak and Burnett in Cincinnati.
- What did I say?

836
00:56:07,596 --> 00:56:10,156
- It's Kmart.
- I know you hear me.

837
00:56:10,232 --> 00:56:12,860
- My boxer shorts have--
- You don't fool me.

838
00:56:12,935 --> 00:56:14,027
Yours are too tight.

839
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:17,004
Did you fuckin' hear what I said?

840
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:18,164
Shut up!

841
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:23,602
Cincinnati's a Long way off.

842
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:26,512
You're getting further away
from Kmart.

843
00:56:26,582 --> 00:56:29,312
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get underwear at Kmart.

844
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:31,318
You have to go to Kmart,
400 Oak Street.

845
00:56:31,386 --> 00:56:33,650
We are not going to Cincinnati,
and that's final.

846
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:37,249
- Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.
- That is final. Did you hear me?

847
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:46,667
I'm goin' out of my mind!

848
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:50,933
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

849
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:54,635
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!

850
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,202
It is underwear wherever you buy it,
in Cincinnati or wherever!

851
00:56:59,314 --> 00:57:01,305
- Kmart.
- You know what I think?

852
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:04,716
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit.

853
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:07,813
You can't tell me that you're
not in there somewhere.

854
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,221
Boxer shorts.

855
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,717
Boxer shorts. Kmart.

856
00:57:13,028 --> 00:57:14,859
These are--
These are Hanes 32.

857
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:18,297
- Driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

858
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:21,063
We have to make a little stop,
find a psychiatrist...

859
00:57:21,136 --> 00:57:23,070
'cause you're driving me crazy.

860
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:25,072
- Oak and Burnett.
- You are driving me--

861
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,199
We have to buy them at Kmart,
Oak and Burnett...

862
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:28,971
back in--

863
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:32,309
You put your shorts
on the highway.

864
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:34,713
We have to go back
to Cincinnati and Kmart.

865
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,877
Good luck finding
a shrink in this town.

866
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:35,403
Raymond?

867
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,683
Hey, you.

868
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,518
Dipshit, move it!

869
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,194
If you ain't gonna move,
I'll move you.

870
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:28,355
Hey, buddy.

871
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:29,898
You'll get run over.

872
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,457
- You're gonna get hurt.
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

873
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:35,265
- Do you hear me?
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

874
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,796
- Move it.
- Hey, it's all right, sir.

875
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,866
I'm sorry. Raymond?

876
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,104
- Yeah.
- Come on.

877
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,147
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

878
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,149
Raymond, come on.

879
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:49,242
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

880
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,253
- It said, 'Don't walk.'
- Yes, it's broken.

881
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,255
It said, 'Don't walk.'

882
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,417
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

883
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:59,223
400 Oak and Burnett.

884
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,629
He said, 'Young man, go west'...

885
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,169
and this is the way
our country developed...

886
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,967
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

887
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,804
During that period of time...

888
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:15,401
there was initiated...

889
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:19,676
what was known as
the Pony Express.

890
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:23,549
I'm sure you have read something about
it in the history of the United States.

891
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,453
I may not have the days
or the years exactly right...

892
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:31,119
but I'm more or less familiar
with the history of the United States.

893
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:34,027
- I love to tell the story--
- He's 'artistic'?

894
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,655
No, he's autistic.

895
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,462
I'm not familiar with that.

896
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,435
What is the exact nature
of the problem?

897
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,027
...in St. Joe's, Missouri--

898
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,437
He lives in a world of his own.

899
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,136
I'm sorry,
but what's wrong with him?

900
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,271
It was a problem gettin' mail
from the East Coast--

901
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:55,443
-Raymond, do 'What's On First?' for her.
-Who's on first. What's on second.

902
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,990
They set up an initial program...

903
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,117
where the Pony Express...

904
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:08,187
would ride for approximately
20 miles--

905
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:10,994
What am I supposed to do?

906
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,831
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

907
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,837
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist...

908
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,499
but I do know his brain doesn't work
Like other people.

909
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:20,543
What he does
isn't intended to be annoying.

910
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,636
If he's gettin' on your nerves,
take a break.

911
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,580
- Spend time away from him.
- I'll just send him back.

912
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,640
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

913
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,846
Inside joke. You're telling me
I just have to deal with this?

914
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,014
I just gotta deal with it.

915
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,991
Yeah, that's about it.

916
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,995
Out of curiosity, does he have
any special abilities?

917
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,933
Well, he's got
a pretty good memory.

918
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,991
He counts toothpicks.

919
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,264
They spilled a box of toothpicks
on the floor...

920
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:51,307
and he took one look and knew
exactly how many there were.

921
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,639
- He counted 'em in seconds.
- Ray.

922
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,008
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

923
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,047
Are you good with numbers?

924
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:00,947
- Yeah.
- I read about this.

925
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,076
- I wanna try somethin' here.
- Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

926
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:05,485
What'd I tell you?
After this.

927
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,023
- Ray, can we try somethin'?
- Yeah.

928
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,026
Do you know how much 312...

929
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,392
times 123 is?

930
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,954
38,376.

931
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:17,590
He's right.

932
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,430
- What?
- He's right.

933
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,470
- He's right?
- Yeah. Ray.

934
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:24,939
How much is 4,343...

935
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:28,205
times 1,234?

936
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,269
5,359,262.

937
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,314
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

938
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:35,374
- He's a genius.
- Ray.

939
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,818
Do you know how much
the square root of 2,130 is?

940
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:44,223
46.15192304.

941
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:47,122
- 2304.
- That's amazing.

942
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,291
That is amazing. He should
work for NASA or something.

943
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:56,229
If you had a dollar,
and you spent 50 cents...

944
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,399
how much money
would you have left?

945
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,338
About 70.

946
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,347
- Seventy cents?
- Seventy cents.

947
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:08,509
- So much for NASA.
- We should go to Kmart.

948
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:10,246
After this, Ray.

949
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,981
400 Oak Street.

950
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:13,989
Do you know how much
a candy bar costs?

951
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,752
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

952
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:20,159
You know how much one of those
new compact cars costs?

953
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,720
About $100.

954
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,865
In his case, he's pretty well off.
He's very high-functioning.

955
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:31,305
Most autistics can't speak
or communicate.

956
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,968
Do you know what 'autistic' is?

957
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,534
- Yeah.
- You know that word?

958
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,183
Are you autistic?

959
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,152
I don't think so.

960
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,689
No. Definitely not.

961
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:54,392
...problem with the Lamborghinis.

962
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:56,864
Let me see if I understand this.

963
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:59,868
It's gonna cost me
$10,000 additional for each car.

964
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:03,929
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

965
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,269
What?

966
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,673
They wanna take out the manifold
and the carburetors...

967
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:09,803
in order to put in
a fuel injection system now?

968
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,346
That is nonsense.

969
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,144
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.

970
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:18,654
Just Leave this on. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet E.P.A. now.

971
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,348
What? No.

972
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,189
You give me the number.
I'll call the conversion shop myself.

973
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,194
That's my pen.
That's definitely my book.

974
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,423
Taking your book
is not a serious injury.

975
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:30,932
For serious injury, look at
the red book. That book is blue.

976
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,730
Forgive me. I've lost
my secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

977
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:36,533
- You're already number 18.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

978
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,836
It's my book.
That's my pen.

979
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,933
12 minutes to Wapner.

980
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,673
- It's definitely very small in here.
- Small... and safe.

981
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,477
- You don't wanna miss the party.
- What you're witnessing is real.

982
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,383
Do you know that?
There's a party in your honor, Ray.

983
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:53,547
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up.

984
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,524
You know why there's a party for you?
'Cause you're the 3-million-dollar man.

985
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,526
- What you are witnessing is real.
- Ken Aldorf.

986
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,528
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

987
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:03,030
- Fart.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

988
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,192
- Fart.
- Did you fart?

989
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,395
- Fart.
- Did you fuckin' fart?

990
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:10,405
Oh, man.
Get the smell out.

991
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,767
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

992
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,778
- Ken Aldorf.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

993
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,780
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

994
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,782
We're definitely locked in this box
with no TV.

995
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,045
I just heard about this $10,000 charge
for every car.

996
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,383
- They're definitely gonna start--
- How can this be?

997
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:29,357
- 'People's Court' starts on the--
- You're telling me another $40,000.

998
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,121
They start on the button.
They definitely start on the button.

999
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:35,164
I've got a problem.
I'll call you from my next stop.

1000
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,995
We're not gonna make it
to the program.

1001
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:40,627
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1002
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,137
- Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1003
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:45,299
Where am I gonna find
a television around here?

1004
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:48,037
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1005
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:07,222
Come on. Come on.

1006
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:10,159
You wanna get in there
and see the show?

1007
01:06:10,236 --> 01:06:13,535
Wanna get in and see the show?
Listen up.

1008
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:16,700
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it.

1009
01:06:19,545 --> 01:06:21,945
You act weird, we don't get in.
You Listening to me?

1010
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:23,948
- Yeah.
- I want you to look normal.

1011
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:26,041
As normal as possible, all right?

1012
01:06:26,118 --> 01:06:28,245
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1013
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:30,881
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1014
01:06:30,957 --> 01:06:34,120
- Yeah. Uh--
- Don't rock and moan.

1015
01:06:34,193 --> 01:06:35,751
Put your hands down.

1016
01:06:39,098 --> 01:06:43,034
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1017
01:06:43,102 --> 01:06:46,503
- You're familiar with our work?
- You mean the TV ratings?

1018
01:06:46,572 --> 01:06:49,507
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected
as a preliminary candidate...

1019
01:06:49,575 --> 01:06:52,669
to become our next Nielsen family
in the tri-county area.

1020
01:06:52,745 --> 01:06:55,771
- My husband's not home.
- If selected, you'll help shape...

1021
01:06:55,848 --> 01:06:59,614
television programming
viewed by our entire nation...

1022
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:01,710
in return for which
you'll receive a check...

1023
01:07:01,787 --> 01:07:04,381
in the amount of $286 each month.

1024
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:06,448
Who's he?

1025
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:10,223
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample--

1026
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,835
- That's it.
- Oh, boy.

1027
01:07:16,903 --> 01:07:18,234
You'll miss your program.

1028
01:07:18,304 --> 01:07:20,704
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1029
01:07:20,773 --> 01:07:22,502
One minute to Wapner.

1030
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:25,908
I had you in there, Ray!

1031
01:07:25,978 --> 01:07:28,139
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1032
01:07:28,214 --> 01:07:31,240
They're in there
making legal history, Ray.

1033
01:07:31,317 --> 01:07:33,251
- Legal history.
- Oh, boy!

1034
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:35,685
- Oh, boy.
- What is going on out here?

1035
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:40,215
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
That man is my brother.

1036
01:07:40,293 --> 01:07:42,420
If he doesn't watch 'People's Court'
in about 30 seconds...

1037
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:44,429
he'll have a fit on your porch.

1038
01:07:44,497 --> 01:07:47,489
Now, you can help me, or you
can stand there and watch it happen.

1039
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:52,101
We Like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1040
01:07:52,171 --> 01:07:55,629
...and she sees an identical twin.

1041
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:58,836
True, he didn't have his shirt on--
the other one did--

1042
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:01,379
but they sure look alike to me.

1043
01:08:01,447 --> 01:08:04,939
If it got on his chest, even if it
didn't burn or got real cold--

1044
01:08:05,017 --> 01:08:07,986
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.

1045
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:11,922
I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.

1046
01:08:11,991 --> 01:08:14,892
I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.

1047
01:08:14,961 --> 01:08:17,452
If I put it up
against a bare chest--

1048
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,623
Ken, work with me.
I'll take care of you--

1049
01:08:22,435 --> 01:08:26,201
- You know that song?
- My judgment is for the defendant.

1050
01:08:29,175 --> 01:08:31,609
We'll be back for the reaction...

1051
01:08:31,677 --> 01:08:34,168
to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.

1052
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:14,417
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

1053
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:16,955
Must be some accounting error.
How much will this cost?

1054
01:09:17,023 --> 01:09:18,285
Twenty dollars, sir.

1055
01:09:22,395 --> 01:09:23,919
Thank you.

1056
01:10:03,102 --> 01:10:05,434
I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a Long time.

1057
01:10:05,504 --> 01:10:08,439
- Definitely gonna be a Long journey.
- Just a couple of more days.

1058
01:10:08,507 --> 01:10:11,476
You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

1059
01:10:11,544 --> 01:10:14,536
- The fella playing first for St. Louie?
- You gonna start with this again?

1060
01:10:14,613 --> 01:10:17,480
It's just another motel.
You gotta do this every time?

1061
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,484
That's the man's name.
That's whose name.

1062
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:22,214
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1063
01:10:22,288 --> 01:10:25,553
Who is on first.
I'm asking you, who's on first?

1064
01:10:25,624 --> 01:10:27,592
- Yo, Ray.
- That's the man's name.

1065
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:30,857
- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?

1066
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:34,058
-Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
-You'll never figure out who's on first.

1067
01:10:34,133 --> 01:10:37,864
Who is on first.
That's the joke. It's comedy.

1068
01:10:37,937 --> 01:10:39,928
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1069
01:10:40,005 --> 01:10:41,267
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.

1070
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,399
Every dollar of it. Yeah.

1071
01:10:43,476 --> 01:10:45,410
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1072
01:10:45,478 --> 01:10:47,412
It's a routine
between Abbott and Costello.

1073
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,540
When you do it, you're not funny.
You're Abbott and Abbott.

1074
01:10:50,616 --> 01:10:52,015
- Yeah.
- You understand me?

1075
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:54,279
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1076
01:10:54,353 --> 01:10:55,615
Whose wife? Yeah.

1077
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:57,849
- Ray?
- Yeah.

1078
01:10:57,923 --> 01:10:59,857
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.

1079
01:10:59,925 --> 01:11:02,553
You know why?
It's not a riddle.

1080
01:11:02,628 --> 01:11:04,562
And if you understood that...

1081
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,997
if you understood that it's funny,
you might get better.

1082
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:10,592
All I'm trying to find out
is what's the guy's name on first base.

1083
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:14,730
What's the guy's name on first base? No,
what's the guy's name on second base.

1084
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:16,741
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1085
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:18,743
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1086
01:11:19,812 --> 01:11:22,212
You know the fella's name?
Yeah.

1087
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:24,215
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1088
01:11:24,283 --> 01:11:26,251
The fella playing first for St. Louie.
Who.

1089
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:28,286
The guy on first.
Who. The first baseman.

1090
01:11:28,354 --> 01:11:30,219
Who is on first.
What are you asking me for?

1091
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:32,689
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1092
01:11:32,758 --> 01:11:34,692
All right, Ray. Come on.

1093
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,024
We're gonna put the bed
by the window...

1094
01:11:37,096 --> 01:11:41,328
we got your apple juice, we'll put
the pens and paper on the table.

1095
01:11:42,968 --> 01:11:44,902
- Did I forget something?
- The cheeseballs.

1096
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:47,438
- Yes.
- Definitely have cheeseballs.

1097
01:11:47,506 --> 01:11:50,566
- I forgot the cheeseballs. We got 'em.
- I have to have 12 cheeseballs.

1098
01:11:50,643 --> 01:11:53,009
- Yes, definitely.
- Get my tartar-control toothpaste.

1099
01:11:53,078 --> 01:11:55,103
We got that for you
a couple of days ago.

1100
01:11:55,181 --> 01:11:56,614
Where's my toothpaste?

1101
01:11:58,684 --> 01:11:59,946
Raymond.

1102
01:12:02,087 --> 01:12:05,181
Remember that doctor asked you
those number questions today?

1103
01:12:05,257 --> 01:12:07,725
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

1104
01:12:07,793 --> 01:12:09,488
I see it.

1105
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:11,086
I see it.

1106
01:12:11,163 --> 01:12:13,131
What's that?
Will you stop for a second?

1107
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,632
I see it.

1108
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,191
Put that down.
I'm trying to talk to you.

1109
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:19,533
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?

1110
01:12:19,605 --> 01:12:22,574
Why do you always have to act
Like an idiot?

1111
01:12:22,641 --> 01:12:25,007
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?

1112
01:12:25,077 --> 01:12:27,045
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.

1113
01:12:27,112 --> 01:12:29,080
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.

1114
01:12:29,148 --> 01:12:30,581
Rinse.

1115
01:12:35,921 --> 01:12:39,322
Why'd you say--
Why'd you say funny teeth?

1116
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:41,359
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1117
01:12:42,728 --> 01:12:44,719
'Rain man'?
I said, 'Rain man'?

1118
01:12:44,797 --> 01:12:46,731
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1119
01:12:50,135 --> 01:12:52,535
Was I trying to say 'Raymond'
and it came out 'rain man'?

1120
01:12:52,605 --> 01:12:54,573
Yeah. Funny Rain Man.

1121
01:12:56,442 --> 01:12:58,501
You? You're the rain man?

1122
01:13:13,192 --> 01:13:15,786
- Who took this picture?
- D-a-d.

1123
01:13:17,429 --> 01:13:20,262
- You lived with us?
- Yeah, 10961 Beechcrest Street...

1124
01:13:20,332 --> 01:13:22,926
Cincinnati, Ohio.

1125
01:13:23,002 --> 01:13:25,562
When did you Leave?

1126
01:13:25,638 --> 01:13:27,572
January 21, 1965.

1127
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:31,132
- You remember then?
- It was Thursday. Very snowy out.

1128
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,872
7.2 inches. Snow that day.

1129
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:38,716
- Just after Mom died. New Year's.
- Yeah, Mom died.

1130
01:13:38,784 --> 01:13:40,718
January 5, 1965.

1131
01:13:40,786 --> 01:13:42,845
And you remember that day
that you left?

1132
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:45,982
- Short and sudden illness.
- You remember that day you left?

1133
01:13:47,559 --> 01:13:49,584
Was I there? Where was l?

1134
01:13:49,662 --> 01:13:52,688
You were in the window.
You waved to me.

1135
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:55,393
'Bye-bye, Rain Man.
Bye-bye, Rain Man.'

1136
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:58,702
So, you--

1137
01:13:59,872 --> 01:14:02,170
- You were the one that sang to me?
- Yeah.

1138
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:07,879
What did you sing?
What was that song?

1139
01:14:10,082 --> 01:14:12,016
What did you sing?

1140
01:14:13,185 --> 01:14:16,586
She was just seventeen

1141
01:14:16,655 --> 01:14:20,284
You know what I mean

1142
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:24,523
And the way she looked
was way beyond compare

1143
01:14:25,798 --> 01:14:31,498
So how could I dance
with another

1144
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:37,899
When I saw her standing there

1145
01:14:42,915 --> 01:14:44,849
Did I Like it
when you sang to me?

1146
01:14:47,319 --> 01:14:50,686
Did we sing any other songs
Like the Beatles?

1147
01:14:54,893 --> 01:14:57,157
Scary! Hot! Scary bad!

1148
01:14:57,229 --> 01:15:00,096
Scary bad! Scary!

1149
01:15:04,436 --> 01:15:07,030
What's scary about it?

1150
01:15:07,106 --> 01:15:09,199
Hot water burn baby!

1151
01:15:09,274 --> 01:15:12,573
- Water!
- 'Hot water burn baby'?

1152
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:14,805
- What baby? Me?
- Yeah.

1153
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,575
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy.

1154
01:15:16,648 --> 01:15:20,106
- Water-- Hot water burn baby.
- I'm not burned.

1155
01:15:20,185 --> 01:15:22,449
I'm not burned.
Look at me, please.

1156
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:24,580
- Water burn baby.
- Please. Please!

1157
01:15:24,656 --> 01:15:27,557
Hot water burn--
Tub burn baby.

1158
01:15:27,626 --> 01:15:30,060
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

1159
01:15:30,129 --> 01:15:32,063
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

1160
01:15:33,332 --> 01:15:36,096
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1161
01:15:38,203 --> 01:15:40,637
It's okay.

1162
01:15:47,446 --> 01:15:49,710
Time for Wallbrook now.

1163
01:15:49,782 --> 01:15:52,182
That's why they put you away.

1164
01:15:52,251 --> 01:15:54,185
They thought you'd hurt me.

1165
01:15:56,822 --> 01:15:58,983
Never hurt baby.

1166
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:01,492
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1167
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,461
Never hurt Charlie.

1168
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,464
What? What?

1169
01:16:06,532 --> 01:16:09,899
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1170
01:16:10,803 --> 01:16:11,861
What, Ray?

1171
01:16:15,841 --> 01:16:17,103
What?

1172
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,614
Come on. It's 11:00, Ray.

1173
01:16:23,682 --> 01:16:25,616
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

1174
01:16:34,893 --> 01:16:38,522
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1175
01:16:45,704 --> 01:16:48,639
There you go. Right where you Like 'em,
at the end of the bed.

1176
01:17:00,686 --> 01:17:01,948
Come on, Ray.

1177
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:51,635
Hi, it's me.

1178
01:17:51,703 --> 01:17:53,864
You didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

1179
01:17:54,973 --> 01:17:56,565
Listen, l, uh--

1180
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,845
I just wanna hear it's not over.

1181
01:18:02,848 --> 01:18:04,873
I'm scared it's over.

1182
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:07,885
Don't ask me tonight.
I don't know what to say.

1183
01:18:07,953 --> 01:18:11,354
- Let it sit.
- Something I'm not real good at.

1184
01:18:11,423 --> 01:18:14,358
There are a lot of things
that you're not good at.

1185
01:18:14,426 --> 01:18:16,360
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?

1186
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:22,333
- I'll see you.
- Ciao.

1187
01:19:49,536 --> 01:19:53,939
Why are you looking at that? I bought
a TV, and you're watching a dryer.

1188
01:19:54,008 --> 01:19:55,805
I don't know.

1189
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,969
Because at the shrink hearing,
we'll have to prove...

1190
01:19:58,045 --> 01:20:01,811
you prefer to watch TV as opposed to
the clothes dryer, you understand that?

1191
01:20:01,882 --> 01:20:03,474
- Yeah.
- You Listening to me?

1192
01:20:05,019 --> 01:20:07,010
Turn this off
when you're not watching it.

1193
01:20:07,087 --> 01:20:09,112
- Yeah.
- You'll run down the batteries.

1194
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:11,453
Then where will you be
at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

1195
01:20:11,525 --> 01:20:13,925
Yeah. The red one
always falls the same.

1196
01:20:13,994 --> 01:20:16,155
Why don't you listen to me?

1197
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:18,164
You don't wanna
listen to me, do you?

1198
01:20:18,232 --> 01:20:20,166
You wanna go back to Wallbrook?

1199
01:20:20,234 --> 01:20:23,067
I gotta make
a phone call.

1200
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:35,337
Lenny, it's me.

1201
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:38,351
Where have you been? I've been
sittin' by this phone for three hours.

1202
01:20:38,419 --> 01:20:40,353
I had to buy some clothes.

1203
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:43,356
Clothes? Charlie, we are
in serious trouble.

1204
01:20:43,424 --> 01:20:45,654
- Why are you buyin' clothes?
- Take it easy.

1205
01:20:45,726 --> 01:20:47,660
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there--

1206
01:20:47,728 --> 01:20:50,492
They repossessed the cars
to pay off the Loan.

1207
01:20:50,564 --> 01:20:53,226
The cars are gone, Charlie.

1208
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,167
And Bateman wants
his down payment back. They all do.

1209
01:20:56,236 --> 01:20:58,101
That's 80,000, Charlie.

1210
01:20:59,006 --> 01:21:01,941
80,000. I don't have it.

1211
01:21:02,009 --> 01:21:05,035
You gotta pay these people back,
or it's all over.

1212
01:21:05,112 --> 01:21:08,445
We're out of business.
What am I gonna tell 'em?

1213
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:09,641
I don't know.

1214
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:29,361
Son of a bitch!

1215
01:21:29,436 --> 01:21:32,166
Son of a bitch!

1216
01:22:06,373 --> 01:22:09,467
This would be easier
if you let me put the top up.

1217
01:22:09,543 --> 01:22:11,477
You wouldn't have to fry.

1218
01:22:11,545 --> 01:22:13,945
Put this lotion on
so you don't burn.

1219
01:22:14,014 --> 01:22:17,006
Don't start with that.
You want me to put the top up?

1220
01:22:17,084 --> 01:22:20,679
- I definitely Like the top down.
- I know. I don't want you to burn.

1221
01:22:20,754 --> 01:22:24,053
Definitely Like it
when the top's--

1222
01:22:24,124 --> 01:22:26,456
It's all right.
Just take it easy.

1223
01:22:26,527 --> 01:22:28,620
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.

1224
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:30,959
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

1225
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:32,555
Very slippery.

1226
01:22:42,376 --> 01:22:47,177
Maldonado swings, and there's
a base hit into center field.

1227
01:22:48,515 --> 01:22:49,846
One run is in.
Here's Brenly going to third.

1228
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:52,351
The throw by Davis... not in time.

1229
01:22:53,854 --> 01:22:56,254
Brenly in safely
at third base...

1230
01:22:56,323 --> 01:22:58,257
on Maldonado's single.

1231
01:22:58,325 --> 01:23:01,988
He held that ball too Long
in center field, don't you think so?

1232
01:23:02,062 --> 01:23:04,053
We'll look at it again.

1233
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:09,262
Treadwell playing way over towards
the right side, shaded him to pull.

1234
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:11,836
Here's Davis.

1235
01:23:13,807 --> 01:23:17,106
Yeah, he seems to hold it there
just a bit, Tom.

1236
01:23:17,177 --> 01:23:19,941
Sort of double-pumped it.
Watch the replay.

1237
01:23:20,013 --> 01:23:23,005
He loses all chance
on a play on Brenly...

1238
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:26,109
even though Brenly
doesn't exactly run fast.

1239
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:31,517
And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit high.

1240
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:05,524
Will you give me
a break with this?

1241
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:10,892
Ray, stop it.

1242
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,611
J-7.

1243
01:24:29,516 --> 01:24:31,450
- K-7? What's that?
- J-7.

1244
01:24:33,654 --> 01:24:34,916
What's J-7?

1245
01:24:37,124 --> 01:24:39,183
What's J-7? The song?

1246
01:24:48,635 --> 01:24:52,071
Look out there, Raymond.
No, out here.

1247
01:24:54,775 --> 01:24:56,675
'18 Wheels and A Dozen Roses.'

1248
01:24:56,743 --> 01:24:59,268
- What's the number?
- E-5.

1249
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:05,618
'Cheating Heart,' Hank Williams.

1250
01:25:05,686 --> 01:25:09,053
'Your Cheating Heart.'
'Course, that's Hank Williams, Jr.

1251
01:25:09,122 --> 01:25:11,056
D-1. D-1.

1252
01:25:14,695 --> 01:25:16,629
'Blue Moon of Kentucky,'
Bill Monroe.

1253
01:25:16,697 --> 01:25:18,631
And the Bluegrass Boys. K-5.

1254
01:25:21,835 --> 01:25:23,826
How many toothpicks
came out of that box?

1255
01:25:23,904 --> 01:25:25,201
246.

1256
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,808
- Yeah.
- 246.

1257
01:25:30,177 --> 01:25:32,202
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

1258
01:25:37,684 --> 01:25:39,652
- You watching that?
- Yeah.

1259
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:46,625
- You seeing that, Ray?
- Yeah. Falling on the ground.

1260
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,655
Okay. Now what do I have left?

1261
01:25:53,734 --> 01:25:55,929
Two jacks, one 8,
one king, one 6...

1262
01:25:56,003 --> 01:25:59,769
two aces, one 10, one 9, one 5.

1263
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,774
One 5.

1264
01:26:01,842 --> 01:26:03,810
You are beautiful, man.

1265
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,934
- I'm an excellent driver.
- You can't drive now, Ray.

1266
01:26:29,002 --> 01:26:31,232
You Listening to me?
This is very important.

1267
01:26:31,304 --> 01:26:34,796
When there's lots of tens and picture
cards left, then it's good for us.

1268
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:37,343
- Say it. 'Tens are good.'
- Tens are good.

1269
01:26:37,411 --> 01:26:40,380
- Okay. And you're gonna bet one--
- One if it's bad.

1270
01:26:40,447 --> 01:26:43,712
- Two if it's good.
- That's right. Two if it's good.

1271
01:26:43,784 --> 01:26:46,014
Now, listen.
Casinos have house rules.

1272
01:26:47,754 --> 01:26:49,688
The first one is,
they don't Like to lose.

1273
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:54,056
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

1274
01:26:54,127 --> 01:26:56,391
That is the cardinal sin, Ray.

1275
01:26:56,463 --> 01:26:59,091
Are you Listening to me?
That's very, very important.

1276
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:02,033
Yeah. Counting is bad.

1277
01:27:02,102 --> 01:27:03,694
Yes. Counting is bad.

1278
01:27:04,604 --> 01:27:06,538
I Like to drive
slow on the driveway.

1279
01:27:06,606 --> 01:27:10,838
You get this right, you can drive
wherever you want as slow as you Like.

1280
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:13,072
I'm an excellent driver.

1281
01:27:44,878 --> 01:27:48,279
Miss Sue Morgan, please pick up
the hotel courtesy phone.

1282
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:36,288
- Rain Man?
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:36,356 --> 01:29:38,727
- Let's play some cards.
- Yeah.

1284
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:51,000
- You want a hit?
- No. You've got 18.

1285
01:29:51,073 --> 01:29:53,166
- Want a hit.
- Sir, you have 18.

1286
01:29:53,242 --> 01:29:55,642
- He doesn't want a hit. Hit me.
- Definitely want a hit.

1287
01:29:55,711 --> 01:29:56,678
Hitting 18.

1288
01:29:56,745 --> 01:29:59,009
- He doesn't want a hit.
- Hit me.

1289
01:30:01,317 --> 01:30:04,218
You took my queen. I've got a ten.
I needed that queen.

1290
01:30:04,286 --> 01:30:06,550
- I can't take it.
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.

1291
01:30:07,523 --> 01:30:09,957
- I need my own queen.
- There's lots of them.

1292
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,428
- 'There's lots of them'?
- Lots and lots of them.

1293
01:30:14,496 --> 01:30:16,464
Hold on here for a second.

1294
01:30:19,702 --> 01:30:21,636
I'm gonna double down.

1295
01:30:22,705 --> 01:30:25,139
Queen. Queen.

1296
01:30:25,207 --> 01:30:26,902
- Queen.
- Yes!

1297
01:30:26,976 --> 01:30:29,410
Yes, sir.
You gotta love this town.

1298
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,446
I'm goin' for it, Nick.

1299
01:30:33,515 --> 01:30:36,507
It certainly looks Like it.

1300
01:30:52,601 --> 01:30:55,468
- You wanna bet one chip or two chips?
- Bet two.

1301
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:57,330
Bet two?

1302
01:31:44,153 --> 01:31:45,643
What's your secret, guys?

1303
01:31:46,722 --> 01:31:49,054
We cheat.

1304
01:31:49,124 --> 01:31:52,719
This is Sam.
Tape table 47.

1305
01:31:59,401 --> 01:32:01,528
- About 85,000.
- 85,000?

1306
01:32:01,603 --> 01:32:04,037
- Yeah.
- Did you call the eye in the sky?

1307
01:32:04,106 --> 01:32:07,269
- Sam did.
- Okay, I'll take over from here.

1308
01:32:10,012 --> 01:32:11,946
Do it again. Do it again.

1309
01:32:13,282 --> 01:32:15,944
- Do it again. All right!
- Yes!

1310
01:32:16,018 --> 01:32:18,486
You're doing well.
I'm happy for you, sir.

1311
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:25,292
What do you see?

1312
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:28,762
He's not catching the hole card,
and he's not past posting us.

1313
01:32:28,831 --> 01:32:32,528
- He's not using a computer.
- No, but something's not right.

1314
01:32:32,601 --> 01:32:35,126
No one can count
into a six-deck shoe.

1315
01:33:09,338 --> 01:33:10,600
Hold it here.

1316
01:33:12,908 --> 01:33:15,809
- Watch my chips. I'll be back.
- Go ahead, sir.

1317
01:33:19,014 --> 01:33:22,814
What are you doing?
You don't Leave in the middle of a hand.

1318
01:33:22,885 --> 01:33:26,218
We are red hot! The Babbitt brothers,
kickin' ass in Vegas!

1319
01:33:26,288 --> 01:33:29,223
- Wheel of Fortune.
- Cleopatra and Caesar are over there.

1320
01:33:29,291 --> 01:33:31,452
-Come on, Ray.
-Look at all this glamorous merchandise.

1321
01:33:31,527 --> 01:33:33,995
- A little one for bad, two for good.
- Yeah. Twenty.

1322
01:33:34,063 --> 01:33:35,997
- Twenty?
- Yeah.

1323
01:33:36,065 --> 01:33:39,228
- It's gonna hit on twenty?
- Yeah. Definitely twenty.

1324
01:33:39,301 --> 01:33:41,235
$3,000 on 20.

1325
01:33:43,338 --> 01:33:45,101
- Definitely twenty.
- Definitely twenty?

1326
01:33:56,852 --> 01:33:58,513
- It's not your game.
- Yeah.

1327
01:33:58,587 --> 01:34:00,555
- I lost $3,000.
- Yeah.

1328
01:34:00,622 --> 01:34:03,090
That's $3,000 I lost.
Come on, Ray.

1329
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:05,786
Little black-- No? Easy, easy.

1330
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:07,954
Don't start banging yourself.

1331
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:10,658
- Maybe we'll play later.
- Yeah.

1332
01:34:10,732 --> 01:34:13,257
- I'm gonna cash in.
- Yeah, cash in.

1333
01:34:13,335 --> 01:34:15,633
- You make me sad, Ray.
- Yeah.

1334
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:18,199
Twenty.

1335
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:23,177
We won $86,000 and some change.

1336
01:34:23,245 --> 01:34:25,179
- Right, Ray?
- 86,500.

1337
01:34:25,247 --> 01:34:29,274
$80,000.
Refund on the car payments.

1338
01:34:29,351 --> 01:34:30,613
And I owe--

1339
01:34:30,686 --> 01:34:33,086
What did I say I owe
to get the Rolex back?

1340
01:34:33,155 --> 01:34:36,591
- $3,500, six months to pay.
- $3,500.

1341
01:34:36,658 --> 01:34:39,991
We don't have to pay for a room.
That's comped. I'm free and clear.

1342
01:34:40,062 --> 01:34:42,121
I'm gonna take a celebration piss.

1343
01:34:44,933 --> 01:34:48,096
Don't go anywhere. Until I get back,
the sign says, 'Don't walk.'

1344
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:50,161
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

1345
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,688
Are you lookin' for a date?

1346
01:35:14,763 --> 01:35:16,094
I don't know.

1347
01:35:16,165 --> 01:35:18,099
- What's your name?
- Raymond.

1348
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:20,260
My name is Iris.

1349

Raymond, you like me?

1350
01:35:22,337 --> 01:35:23,861
I don't know.

1351
01:35:23,939 --> 01:35:25,600
You don't know.

1352
01:35:25,674 --> 01:35:29,371
If you gave me a chance, you would.
Why don't we get to know each other?

1353
01:35:29,444 --> 01:35:32,880
- To get to know each other.
- He doesn't have any money, honey.

1354
01:35:34,616 --> 01:35:37,107
That's all right, sugar,
'cause we are just talkin'.

1355
01:35:37,186 --> 01:35:39,154
Yeah, we're just talking.

1356
01:35:40,389 --> 01:35:44,155
- Let's go upstairs. What are you doin'?
- Getting to know each other.

1357
01:35:44,226 --> 01:35:46,160
- Just talking.
- What room? I'll bring him up.

1358
01:35:46,228 --> 01:35:47,661
That's all right.

1359
01:35:49,064 --> 01:35:51,498
Do you want to stay
and get to know each other?

1360
01:35:51,567 --> 01:35:54,229
Yeah, get to know each other.
Just talking.

1361
01:35:55,037 --> 01:35:58,006
This will be interesting.
I'll be over here.

1362
01:36:00,108 --> 01:36:03,544
- He doesn't seem to Like me. Who is he?
- My brother. I'm living in his room.

1363
01:36:03,612 --> 01:36:08,311
- He seems young to be your brother.
- He was born August 12, 1962.

1364
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:09,816
It was a Sunday.

1365
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,681
What exactly do you guys do here?

1366
01:36:14,756 --> 01:36:17,987
- We're counting cards.
- You're counting cards?

1367
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,358
We're counting cards.

1368
01:36:20,429 --> 01:36:22,590
We're counting cards.

1369
01:36:22,664 --> 01:36:24,757
What else do you do?

1370
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:26,767
We're counting cards.

1371
01:36:26,835 --> 01:36:28,996
I know that.
What else do you do?

1372
01:36:29,071 --> 01:36:31,062
Are you taking
any prescription medication?

1373
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:34,040
Whoa. Look, I'm outta here.

1374
01:36:35,244 --> 01:36:37,610

1375
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,613

1376
01:36:39,681 --> 01:36:41,876
I have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out at 11:00.

1377
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:45,477
10:00, daylight saving time.

1378
01:36:45,554 --> 01:36:47,351
- 10:00, daylight saving--
- 10:00?

1379
01:36:47,422 --> 01:36:49,947
- 10:00, daylight saving time.
- You Like her? You think she's pretty?

1380
01:36:50,025 --> 01:36:51,959
Yeah. She's very sparkly.

1381
01:36:52,027 --> 01:36:55,087
- Definitely very sparkly.
- Very sparkly.

1382
01:36:56,365 --> 01:36:59,334
I've never seen you in a suit.
He did a great job.

1383
01:36:59,401 --> 01:37:01,926
You don't realize how good you look.
Do you Like it?

1384
01:37:02,004 --> 01:37:03,938
It's not Kmart.

1385
01:37:04,006 --> 01:37:08,067
How could you not Like that suit?
You look fantastic, Ray?

1386
01:37:08,143 --> 01:37:11,408
- It's not a Kmart suit.
- Let me let you in on a secret.

1387
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,880
- Kmart sucks. Okay?
- Yeah.

1388
01:37:17,252 --> 01:37:19,117
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

1389
01:37:19,187 --> 01:37:23,214
It's a high roller's suite.
This is for you.

1390
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:25,760
- You ever seen a room Like this before?
- Yeah.

1391
01:37:25,827 --> 01:37:27,260
What's up there?

1392
01:37:27,329 --> 01:37:29,729
What's up there?
You're not even looking.

1393
01:37:29,798 --> 01:37:32,665
- Yeah. Bed.
- That's your bed.

1394
01:37:32,734 --> 01:37:35,532
I had them put it by the window,
just the way you Like it.

1395
01:37:35,604 --> 01:37:38,300
- Right by the window.
- Go on up.

1396
01:37:38,373 --> 01:37:41,308
- Just the way you Like it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1397
01:37:42,778 --> 01:37:45,110
Look at you with all
those lights, Ray.

1398
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:47,648
You are Mr. Las Vegas now.

1399
01:37:47,716 --> 01:37:49,684
What do you think?

1400
01:37:49,751 --> 01:37:52,982
There's a lot of lights out there.
It's very sparkly. Very twinkly.

1401
01:37:53,889 --> 01:37:57,290
We made a lot of money today.

1402
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:01,523
Forgetting the $3,000 that we
tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

1403
01:38:01,596 --> 01:38:03,587
Yeah, 'Wheel Of Fortune.'

1404
01:38:03,665 --> 01:38:06,964
And I'm sorry about that.
I got a little carried away.

1405
01:38:07,035 --> 01:38:10,766
I got a little hot, Ray.

1406
01:38:10,839 --> 01:38:15,105
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

1407
01:38:17,012 --> 01:38:21,415
I'm apologizing. I got
a little carried away. The money.

1408
01:38:21,483 --> 01:38:25,613
I got a little greedy.
Wanna say somethin'?

1409
01:38:25,687 --> 01:38:28,281
I have to be at the bar
at 10:00 with Iris.

1410
01:38:28,357 --> 01:38:30,587
I gotta thank you, man.

1411
01:38:32,561 --> 01:38:34,495
You did it.

1412
01:38:34,563 --> 01:38:37,691
I was just there.
You saved my ass.

1413
01:38:37,766 --> 01:38:40,555
I'm just along for the ride.

1414
01:38:40,622 --> 01:38:44,649
Be at the bar at 10:00.
Have to go to a date with Iris.

1415
01:38:44,726 --> 01:38:46,853
Iris, that's her name.

1416
01:38:46,928 --> 01:38:48,793
Big date. Gonna go dancing.

1417
01:38:48,864 --> 01:38:51,731
I have to go to a date
with Iris at the bar.

1418
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,859
- Know how to dance?
- I don't know.

1419
01:38:53,935 --> 01:38:56,426
You ought to learn sometime.

1420
01:38:56,505 --> 01:38:59,167
Yeah, have to learn
to dance with a date.

1421
01:38:59,241 --> 01:39:02,506
- I have to learn to dance with a date.
- I was just kidding.

1422
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:04,807
You're not gonna have to
dance on this date.

1423
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,611
I have to go to the date,
learn to dance. Definitely. Now.

1424
01:39:08,684 --> 01:39:10,709
You don't have to dance now...

1425
01:39:10,786 --> 01:39:13,448
but I'll teach you
how to dance sometime.

1426
01:39:13,522 --> 01:39:17,049
- You won't have to dance on this.
- Have to learn how to dance now.

1427
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:21,391
I'm sorry I brought this up.
All right, Ray, my mistake.

1428
01:39:21,463 --> 01:39:24,398
You got the only
famous dancing hooker in Vegas.

1429
01:39:24,466 --> 01:39:25,899
Stand over there.

1430
01:39:34,376 --> 01:39:36,742
- Come over here.
- Yeah.

1431
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:41,179
You hear the music?
Just watch my feet.

1432
01:39:41,249 --> 01:39:43,717
Raymond, watch my feet.

1433
01:39:43,785 --> 01:39:46,811
Just do what I'm doin'. Okay?

1434
01:39:46,888 --> 01:39:50,824
You feel the rhythm of the music?
We're just movin' our feet.

1435
01:39:50,892 --> 01:39:54,225
You're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

1436
01:39:54,296 --> 01:39:56,821
I'm the date, so you want to--

1437
01:39:58,934 --> 01:40:02,267
You wanna put your
left hand up Like this.

1438
01:40:02,337 --> 01:40:05,795
Raymond, don't stop movin'.
Payin' attention?

1439
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:09,776
Put your left hand up Like this.
Left hand. That's good.

1440
01:40:09,845 --> 01:40:13,076
Don't stop movin'.
Good. Just Like that.

1441
01:40:13,148 --> 01:40:15,582
Take this other hand,
put it behind my back.

1442
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:18,676
- Ray, you wanna learn how to dance?
- Yeah.

1443
01:40:18,754 --> 01:40:22,053
You gotta touch someone when you dance.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1444
01:40:22,124 --> 01:40:25,457
All right?
Just put it right there.

1445
01:40:25,527 --> 01:40:28,018
I take my hand,
I put it up here.

1446
01:40:28,096 --> 01:40:30,189
Watch my feet, Ray.

1447
01:40:30,265 --> 01:40:34,326
The rhythm, the rhythm.
All right?

1448
01:40:34,402 --> 01:40:38,566
You can't watch my feet the whole time,
so you're gonna have to look up.

1449
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:42,303
Now when I tell you to,
I want you to just look up...

1450
01:40:42,377 --> 01:40:44,902
real slow, just keep movin'.

1451
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:46,914
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1452
01:40:46,982 --> 01:40:49,212
- Start lookin' up.
- Yeah.

1453
01:40:49,284 --> 01:40:51,548
A little more.
Keep movin'.

1454
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:54,248
- Just a little more.
- Yeah.

1455
01:40:54,322 --> 01:40:56,449
A little more, Ray.

1456
01:40:56,525 --> 01:40:58,618
All the way up.

1457
01:41:00,662 --> 01:41:03,563
There you go, Ray.
You're dancin'.

1458
01:41:03,632 --> 01:41:07,932
- Yeah, dancin'.
- You wanna close your hand here.

1459
01:41:08,003 --> 01:41:11,666
You wanna put it Like that.
You're gonna turn me Like this.

1460
01:41:12,741 --> 01:41:15,369
Just turn me.
That's good.

1461
01:41:15,443 --> 01:41:17,911
- This is dancin'.
- This is dancing.

1462
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:21,415
I don't know about you,
but I'm startin' to feel a little silly.

1463
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:57,311
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1464
01:41:57,385 --> 01:41:58,647
All right!

1465
01:41:58,753 --> 01:42:00,721
You are a good dancer.

1466
01:42:00,789 --> 01:42:03,349
- You wanna give me a hug?
- Yeah.

1467
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:18,564
I just wanted to
give you a hug, Ray.

1468
01:42:19,941 --> 01:42:23,308
I just felt Like givin' you a hug.

1469
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:39,893
What are you doin' here?

1470
01:42:39,961 --> 01:42:43,362
- I'm unemployed.
- What do you mean?

1471
01:42:43,431 --> 01:42:47,299
- You don't know about the business?
- Yeah, I know. Come on in.

1472
01:42:49,537 --> 01:42:52,563
I'm glad to see you.

1473
01:42:52,641 --> 01:42:54,233
Ray, look who's here.

1474
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,333
It's not right,
what you're doing to Raymond.

1475
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:24,929
- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.

1476
01:43:25,006 --> 01:43:29,705
He's in Las Vegas in a suit
in a big room. It makes me sad.

1477
01:43:29,778 --> 01:43:31,905
Six minutes to my date.

1478
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:34,676
Six minutes to Iris.

1479
01:43:34,749 --> 01:43:36,182
He has a date?

1480
01:43:37,786 --> 01:43:41,779
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that television everywhere we go.

1481
01:43:41,856 --> 01:43:44,450
Why do you have to bring
a Watchman on your date?

1482
01:43:44,526 --> 01:43:46,460
A man's dancing.

1483
01:43:46,528 --> 01:43:49,793
But what does your date
look Like, Raymond?

1484
01:43:49,864 --> 01:43:52,628
She's very sparkly.
She looks Like a holiday.

1485
01:43:54,736 --> 01:43:57,637
- I haven't heard that one before.
- Mr. Babbitt?

1486
01:43:57,706 --> 01:44:00,903
- Mr. Kelso would Like to see you.
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.

1487
01:44:00,976 --> 01:44:04,537
He's director of security.
Would you come with me, please?

1488
01:44:04,612 --> 01:44:06,944
Sure. Susanna,
you stay with Raymond.

1489
01:44:07,015 --> 01:44:09,449
- Right this way.
- Certainly.

1490
01:44:24,666 --> 01:44:26,657
10:01, she's not here.

1491
01:44:26,735 --> 01:44:29,033
She'll come. She will.

1492
01:44:38,346 --> 01:44:42,373
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.

1493
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:45,317
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1494
01:44:45,387 --> 01:44:48,550
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we analyze the tapes...

1495
01:44:48,623 --> 01:44:51,990
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

1496
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:55,655
These tapes suggest that you should
take your winnings and Leave the state.

1497
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:58,198
Someone has a good day
at the tables...

1498
01:44:58,266 --> 01:45:00,860
and you accuse them
of illegal activities?

1499
01:45:00,935 --> 01:45:03,130
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

1500
01:45:03,204 --> 01:45:05,468
All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.

1501
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:10,273
Those are the best odds you're
gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.

1502
01:45:19,421 --> 01:45:22,356
- Did you want to dance on your date?
- Yeah.

1503
01:45:22,424 --> 01:45:26,656
There'll be other chances. Many pretty
girls would love to dance with you.

1504
01:45:26,728 --> 01:45:29,162
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

1505
01:45:46,915 --> 01:45:49,816
- I Like this music, Ray.
- Elevator stopped.

1506
01:45:49,884 --> 01:45:54,184
It's okay. You think you could show me
how you were going to dance with Iris?

1507
01:45:54,255 --> 01:45:56,120
- Yeah.
- Yes?

1508
01:45:56,191 --> 01:45:59,456
- Would you Like to dance with me?
- Elevator's on hold.

1509
01:45:59,527 --> 01:46:01,927
- Give me this.
- Yeah.

1510
01:46:04,466 --> 01:46:07,026
- Yeah.
- Show me how.

1511
01:46:07,102 --> 01:46:09,195
Charlie Babbitt taught me.

1512
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:11,704
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.

1513
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:15,600
Dancing in the elevator.

1514
01:46:15,677 --> 01:46:17,440
It's nice.

1515
01:46:20,048 --> 01:46:21,481
You're very good.

1516
01:46:35,029 --> 01:46:38,760
- Iris missed a beautiful dance.
- Yeah.

1517
01:46:40,001 --> 01:46:42,765
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, a kiss.

1518
01:46:42,837 --> 01:46:45,931
- Have you ever kissed a girl?
- I don't know.

1519
01:46:47,175 --> 01:46:49,439
You don't know?

1520
01:46:50,778 --> 01:46:53,747
Open your mouth. Open.

1521
01:46:53,815 --> 01:46:56,215
- Yeah.
- Like this.

1522
01:46:56,284 --> 01:47:00,050
Like you were tasting
something very good...

1523
01:47:00,121 --> 01:47:02,589
and very soft.

1524
01:47:05,727 --> 01:47:08,890
Like this.
Close your eyes.

1525
01:47:15,703 --> 01:47:18,137
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

1526
01:47:26,414 --> 01:47:28,905
- How was that?
- Wet.

1527
01:47:30,752 --> 01:47:33,721
- Then we did it right.
- Elevator's definitely stuck.

1528
01:47:33,788 --> 01:47:35,278
No, it's not stuck.

1529
01:47:39,861 --> 01:47:40,987
Here.

1530
01:47:43,064 --> 01:47:45,862
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

1531
01:47:47,135 --> 01:47:49,465
- Like us.
- Yeah, Like us.

1532
01:47:49,532 --> 01:47:53,559
What'd I tell you, Ray?
I promised you could drive.

1533
01:47:53,636 --> 01:47:57,367
- At Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway.
- Charlie, this is okay?

1534
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,874
- I'm an excellent driver.
- He's good on a driveway.

1535
01:48:58,635 --> 01:49:00,899
Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?

1536
01:49:02,505 --> 01:49:04,973
So, I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

1537
01:49:05,041 --> 01:49:07,703
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.

1538
01:49:07,777 --> 01:49:10,177
- Yeah. I'm nervous.
- I know.

1539
01:49:10,246 --> 01:49:14,080
Listen, I'm glad, happy--
I'm happy that you came to Vegas.

1540
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:16,744
I know.

1541
01:49:17,754 --> 01:49:19,187
Ciao.

1542
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:24,626
Ray, thank you for the date
in the elevator. It was really nice.

1543
01:49:24,694 --> 01:49:26,628
- Yeah.
- Ciao.

1544
01:49:26,696 --> 01:49:29,893
- Thank you for the what?
- It's something between us.

1545
01:49:29,966 --> 01:49:32,332
- Between us?
- Us.

1546
01:49:35,905 --> 01:49:37,668
Us, Ray?

1547
01:49:43,046 --> 01:49:46,015
Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.

1548
01:49:46,082 --> 01:49:48,710
Of course, there's
definitely no bed there.

1549
01:49:48,785 --> 01:49:52,915
No, this is a magic bed, Ray.
You just watch and see.

1550
01:49:52,989 --> 01:49:57,016
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.

1551
01:49:57,093 --> 01:50:00,028
Went to the video store.
Got a surprise for you, Ray.

1552
01:50:00,096 --> 01:50:02,758
Picked up a video for you.

1553
01:50:02,832 --> 01:50:05,960
Don't start with that, Ray.

1554
01:50:06,035 --> 01:50:09,698
It's not just another place, Ray.
This is my place.

1555
01:50:09,772 --> 01:50:12,434
I'm asking you who's on first.
That's the man's name.

1556
01:50:12,508 --> 01:50:14,999
Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.

1557
01:50:15,078 --> 01:50:18,570
You got a first baseman on first?
Certainly. Then who's playing first?

1558
01:50:22,185 --> 01:50:24,619
- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?

1559
01:50:24,687 --> 01:50:26,780
Yes.

1560
01:50:26,856 --> 01:50:28,790
- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?

1561
01:50:28,858 --> 01:50:30,792
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1562
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:33,454
- Whose wife?
- Yes.

1563
01:50:33,529 --> 01:50:35,463
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

1564
01:50:35,531 --> 01:50:37,226
Absolutely.

1565
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:39,700
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?

1566
01:50:39,769 --> 01:50:41,964
No, What is on second base.

1567
01:50:42,038 --> 01:50:45,633
- Don't you think this is funny?
- Yes, it's funny.

1568
01:50:47,643 --> 01:50:50,874
- Where'd you see this first?
- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.

1569
01:50:50,947 --> 01:50:53,108
- Dad, huh?
- Yeah.

1570
01:50:53,182 --> 01:50:56,117
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.

1571
01:50:57,653 --> 01:51:01,350
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.
I'd Like you to call me.

1572
01:51:01,424 --> 01:51:02,948
Yeah, what is it?

1573
01:51:03,025 --> 01:51:06,290
I thought I got the machine.

1574
01:51:06,362 --> 01:51:10,093
I just got into town, and the
psychological interview is tomorrow.

1575
01:51:10,166 --> 01:51:12,191
Yes, sir, I know that.

1576
01:51:12,268 --> 01:51:14,600
I thought we should
get together and talk.

1577
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:18,629
I think it might be in your
best interests to meet me.

1578
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:19,970
When?

1579
01:51:20,042 --> 01:51:23,205
I'm at the Bonaventure.
How about tonight at 8:30?

1580
01:51:45,601 --> 01:51:49,560
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,
who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.

1581
01:51:49,639 --> 01:51:53,131
- Yeah, I know.
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.

1582
01:51:53,209 --> 01:51:56,007
- Good luck.
- This isn't a close call.

1583
01:51:56,078 --> 01:51:58,979
It's a formality. Your brother's
a very disabled individual.

1584
01:51:59,048 --> 01:52:01,915
Are you trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

1585
01:52:01,984 --> 01:52:05,044
No, I'm telling you
it's always been a lost cause.

1586
01:52:05,121 --> 01:52:07,885
- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.

1587
01:52:07,957 --> 01:52:10,619
Your father put me in charge
of all the money.

1588
01:52:10,693 --> 01:52:13,560
It doesn't matter whether or not
you win custody of Raymond.

1589
01:52:13,629 --> 01:52:16,928
I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion.

1590
01:52:16,999 --> 01:52:21,197
- So you can't lose?
- I can lose Raymond.

1591
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:24,068
I care about your brother's Life
and the treatment he receives.

1592
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:27,405
I made a commitment to your father
some 20 years ago...

1593
01:52:27,476 --> 01:52:29,808
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

1594
01:52:29,879 --> 01:52:31,744
What is this?

1595
01:52:31,814 --> 01:52:33,406
It's a very big check.

1596
01:52:37,019 --> 01:52:38,680
$250,000.

1597
01:52:38,754 --> 01:52:42,155
And no strings attached.
Just walk away, Charlie.

1598
01:52:43,426 --> 01:52:45,860
This isn't about you and me.

1599
01:52:45,928 --> 01:52:48,089
It's not about winning or losing.

1600
01:52:50,433 --> 01:52:54,267
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

1601
01:52:54,337 --> 01:52:56,396
You didn't have an answer.

1602
01:52:57,473 --> 01:52:59,600
I don't know.

1603
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:03,274
I just realized
I'm not pissed off anymore...

1604
01:53:03,346 --> 01:53:05,712
my father cut me out of his will.

1605
01:53:07,283 --> 01:53:10,946
You probably knew he tried
to contact me over the years.

1606
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:13,580
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

1607
01:53:13,656 --> 01:53:17,490
If he was my son and didn't return
my calls, I'd have written him out.

1608
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:20,154
But it's not about
the money anymore.

1609
01:53:21,397 --> 01:53:24,423
You know,
I just don't understand.

1610
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:27,526
Why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?

1611
01:53:27,603 --> 01:53:31,266
Why didn't anyone ever tell me
that I had a brother?

1612
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:38,974
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

1613
01:55:23,786 --> 01:55:26,380
Ray! Come on.

1614
01:55:26,455 --> 01:55:29,424
It stopped.
It's all right.

1615
01:55:36,198 --> 01:55:38,189
V-E-R-N.

1616
01:55:38,267 --> 01:55:40,531
Vern. Vern.

1617
01:55:40,603 --> 01:55:43,470
My main man, Vern.

1618
01:55:43,539 --> 01:55:45,973
V-E-R-N.

1619
01:55:52,815 --> 01:55:55,079
My main man, Vern.

1620
01:55:57,753 --> 01:56:01,108
V-E-R-N.
Vern, my main man.

1621
01:56:01,175 --> 01:56:03,769
They got raspberry, blueberry...

1622
01:56:03,844 --> 01:56:06,540
whole wheat, peachy keen,
beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.

1623
01:56:06,614 --> 01:56:09,913
How about buckwheat?
What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?

1624
01:56:09,984 --> 01:56:11,849
- Pancakes.
- What kind?

1625
01:56:11,919 --> 01:56:13,716
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

1626
01:56:13,788 --> 01:56:16,621
The maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pan--

1627
01:56:20,761 --> 01:56:23,355
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1628
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:25,865
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

1629
01:56:45,586 --> 01:56:47,520
Step back a little bit.

1630
01:57:07,808 --> 01:57:09,241
Hello?

1631
01:57:10,311 --> 01:57:13,075
Why don't you go
sit down over there?

1632
01:57:16,751 --> 01:57:18,184
Hello?

1633
01:57:18,252 --> 01:57:22,052
This is not a legal proceeding,
so there's no judge present...

1634
01:57:22,123 --> 01:57:24,956
just the people
who care about Raymond.

1635
01:57:25,026 --> 01:57:28,894
Raymond, have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.

1636
01:57:28,963 --> 01:57:31,523
Raymond, right here.
How about this seat?

1637
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:34,966
- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.

1638
01:57:35,036 --> 01:57:38,301
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

1639
01:57:38,372 --> 01:57:42,604
Ray, the TV?
On the floor. I'm sorry.

1640
01:57:42,677 --> 01:57:45,976
I don't know an easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--

1641
01:57:46,047 --> 01:57:47,981
Have I lost already?

1642
01:57:48,049 --> 01:57:50,517
No, you haven't lost.
I'm not the judge and jury.

1643
01:57:50,584 --> 01:57:52,779
I'm just making
a recommendation to a court.

1644
01:57:52,853 --> 01:57:56,516
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professional.

1645
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:59,582
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years...

1646
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:02,629
and Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.

1647
01:58:02,697 --> 01:58:05,131
You've made up your mind.
I'll see you in court.

1648
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:08,726
My brother came further with me
than he did with you in 20 years.

1649
01:58:08,803 --> 01:58:11,294
- It's not necessary to--
- You don't know anything about us.

1650
01:58:11,372 --> 01:58:14,899
- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.

1651
01:58:14,975 --> 01:58:17,239
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

1652
01:58:17,311 --> 01:58:20,041
- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.

1653
01:58:20,114 --> 01:58:23,311
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

1654
01:58:23,384 --> 01:58:25,375
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.

1655
01:58:25,453 --> 01:58:27,546
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

1656
01:58:27,621 --> 01:58:31,523
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

1657
01:58:31,592 --> 01:58:33,526
Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

1658
01:58:33,594 --> 01:58:36,757
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

1659
01:58:36,831 --> 01:58:39,197
- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

1660
01:58:39,266 --> 01:58:42,360
- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

1661
01:58:42,436 --> 01:58:44,427
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.

1662
01:58:44,505 --> 01:58:47,338
Danced in the elevator with Susanna.
Kissed Susanna.

1663
01:58:47,408 --> 01:58:49,672
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.

1664
01:58:49,744 --> 01:58:52,804
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.

1665
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,144
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.

1666
01:58:55,216 --> 01:58:56,683
- Wet?
- Yeah.

1667
01:58:56,751 --> 01:58:59,481
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

1668
01:58:59,553 --> 01:59:02,613
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.

1669
01:59:02,690 --> 01:59:04,783
- You drove?
- Yeah.

1670
01:59:04,859 --> 01:59:08,351
-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.

1671
01:59:08,429 --> 01:59:11,762
He didn't drive on the highway.

1672
01:59:11,832 --> 01:59:14,494
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?

1673
01:59:14,568 --> 01:59:18,834
Well, things they tend to do when--
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.

1674
01:59:18,906 --> 01:59:21,397
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

1675
01:59:21,475 --> 01:59:25,070
He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.

1676
01:59:25,146 --> 01:59:28,013
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?

1677
01:59:28,082 --> 01:59:30,312
- This morning when--
- This morning?

1678
01:59:30,384 --> 01:59:33,979
This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.

1679
01:59:34,054 --> 01:59:37,319
You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.

1680
01:59:37,391 --> 01:59:39,325
He got nervous,
but he's fine now.

1681
01:59:39,393 --> 01:59:41,725
Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.

1682
01:59:41,796 --> 01:59:44,390
We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.

1683
01:59:44,465 --> 01:59:47,832
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.

1684
01:59:47,902 --> 01:59:50,735
- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.

1685
01:59:50,805 --> 01:59:52,773
I'm not placing any blame--

1686
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:55,934
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.

1687
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:59,741
I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?

1688
01:59:59,814 --> 02:00:01,748
No one is saying anything.

1689
02:00:01,816 --> 02:00:04,614
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.

1690
02:00:04,685 --> 02:00:07,119
- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.

1691
02:00:07,188 --> 02:00:10,021
- This is my family.
- I understand that.

1692
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:13,890
Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.

1693
02:00:13,961 --> 02:00:18,523
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

1694
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:21,830
You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.

1695
02:00:21,902 --> 02:00:24,666
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

1696
02:00:24,738 --> 02:00:26,672
There's some things
I'd Like to go over.

1697
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:30,369
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...

1698
02:00:30,444 --> 02:00:33,311
and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?

1699
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:35,211
My father died.
I was upset.

1700
02:00:35,282 --> 02:00:36,977
That was wrong.

1701
02:00:37,051 --> 02:00:40,452
Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...

1702
02:00:40,521 --> 02:00:43,081
and you want to
take care of him.

1703
02:00:43,157 --> 02:00:45,318
Yes.

1704
02:00:45,392 --> 02:00:48,486
From the beginning
it was Like a kidnapping.

1705
02:00:48,562 --> 02:00:51,360
Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.

1706
02:00:51,432 --> 02:00:55,095
But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

1707
02:00:55,169 --> 02:00:56,431
Yes.

1708
02:00:56,504 --> 02:00:58,768
- Look, that--
- Yes?

1709
02:00:58,839 --> 02:01:01,865
I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.

1710
02:01:01,942 --> 02:01:03,933
When it started out--

1711
02:01:04,011 --> 02:01:06,946
- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?

1712
02:01:07,014 --> 02:01:09,676
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

1713
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:12,583
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.

1714
02:01:12,653 --> 02:01:15,053
No accusations?

1715
02:01:15,122 --> 02:01:18,148
See, you have to understand...

1716
02:01:18,225 --> 02:01:22,457
that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...

1717
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:24,122
in name.

1718
02:01:27,968 --> 02:01:29,560
And then...

1719
02:01:32,706 --> 02:01:34,901
this morning we had pancakes.

1720
02:01:34,975 --> 02:01:37,000
Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--

1721
02:01:37,077 --> 02:01:39,568
Maple syrup on the table.

1722
02:01:39,647 --> 02:01:42,081
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1723
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:44,512
See, we--

1724
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,981
I made a connection.

1725
02:01:48,055 --> 02:01:50,455
I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...

1726
02:01:50,524 --> 02:01:53,925
but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...

1727
02:01:53,994 --> 02:01:56,792
whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...

1728
02:01:56,864 --> 02:02:00,459
and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.

1729
02:02:00,534 --> 02:02:01,899
I'm all for that.

1730
02:02:01,969 --> 02:02:05,132
- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.

1731
02:02:05,205 --> 02:02:07,139
He can't decide for himself.

1732
02:02:07,207 --> 02:02:09,573
He's capable
of a lot more than you know.

1733
02:02:09,643 --> 02:02:12,009
Why don't we ask Raymond?

1734
02:02:12,079 --> 02:02:15,879
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?

1735
02:02:15,950 --> 02:02:18,680
- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?

1736
02:02:21,655 --> 02:02:23,589
Do you wanna stay
with your brother?

1737
02:02:25,292 --> 02:02:28,591
Raymond, would you Like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?

1738
02:02:28,662 --> 02:02:31,153
The doctor's asking you a question.

1739
02:02:31,231 --> 02:02:33,358
- So you listen.
- Yeah.

1740
02:02:33,434 --> 02:02:37,427
Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?

1741
02:02:37,504 --> 02:02:40,564
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1742
02:02:40,641 --> 02:02:42,700
- You do?
- Yeah.

1743
02:02:42,776 --> 02:02:44,038
You wanna stay with your brother?

1744
02:02:44,111 --> 02:02:47,512
Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

1745
02:02:47,581 --> 02:02:50,049
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

1746
02:02:51,285 --> 02:02:54,015
- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1747
02:02:57,391 --> 02:03:00,087
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.

1748
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:03,220
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1749
02:03:03,297 --> 02:03:07,256
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

1750
02:03:07,334 --> 02:03:08,767
Yeah.

1751
02:03:10,104 --> 02:03:14,268
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1752
02:03:14,341 --> 02:03:16,241
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1753
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:18,369
They're two separate things.

1754
02:03:18,445 --> 02:03:22,279
Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.

1755
02:03:22,349 --> 02:03:25,876
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.

1756
02:03:25,953 --> 02:03:29,912
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?

1757
02:03:29,990 --> 02:03:32,424
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.

1758
02:03:32,493 --> 02:03:33,892
All right.

1759
02:03:33,961 --> 02:03:36,122
Just hold on here.

1760
02:03:36,196 --> 02:03:37,788
All right.

1761
02:03:37,865 --> 02:03:41,096
All right.
You made your point.

1762
02:03:41,168 --> 02:03:45,298
You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.

1763
02:03:45,372 --> 02:03:47,499
- It's over.
- Yeah.

1764
02:03:47,574 --> 02:03:50,509
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

1765
02:03:50,577 --> 02:03:52,807
- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.

1766
02:03:53,847 --> 02:03:55,838
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

1767
02:03:58,652 --> 02:04:00,643
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?

1768
02:04:00,721 --> 02:04:02,518
Excuse me.

1769
02:04:10,616 --> 02:04:13,050
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

1770
02:04:14,887 --> 02:04:18,345
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1771
02:04:20,759 --> 02:04:22,693
I don't know.

1772
02:04:28,066 --> 02:04:31,593
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1773
02:04:35,507 --> 02:04:38,237
- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.

1774
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:41,837
- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.

1775
02:04:43,182 --> 02:04:45,343
- What?
- My main man.

1776
02:04:49,922 --> 02:04:51,355
Listen.

1777
02:04:54,993 --> 02:04:58,258
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.

1778
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:04,160
Because you see, these--

1779
02:05:04,236 --> 02:05:08,502
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.

1780
02:05:09,408 --> 02:05:11,535
- You know?
- Yeah.

1781
02:05:13,178 --> 02:05:17,308
What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.

1782
02:05:18,383 --> 02:05:20,180
Connecting.

1783
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:25,889
- I Like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.

1784
02:05:25,958 --> 02:05:28,859
Yes, you are.

1785
02:05:56,121 --> 02:05:58,749
I Like having you
for my big brother.

1786
02:06:17,442 --> 02:06:19,774
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1787
02:06:22,881 --> 02:06:25,509
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1788
02:06:26,718 --> 02:06:28,481
Main man.

1789

May I have your attention, please?

Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound...

1791
02:07:08,093 --> 02:07:10,186

1795
02:07:26,078 --> 02:07:27,340
Hello, Raymond.

1796
02:07:27,412 --> 02:07:30,108
Wouldn't you feel more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?

1797
02:07:30,182 --> 02:07:31,615
Tell him, Ray.

1798
02:07:31,683 --> 02:07:33,742
- Kmart sucks.
- I see.

1799
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:38,017
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

1800
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:41,651
Why don't you take a couple of minutes?
See you, Charlie.

1801
02:07:42,828 --> 02:07:45,763
You made a joke, Ray.

1802
02:07:50,535 --> 02:07:54,596
I guess I'd better give this to you.
You're gonna have to carry this now.

1803
02:07:56,108 --> 02:07:59,566
It's got your cheeseballs,
your apple juice...

1804
02:07:59,644 --> 02:08:01,612

'Who's On First?' video
that you Like.

1806
02:08:04,182 --> 02:08:07,242
- 'Who's On First?' is very funny.
- I told you it's funny.

1807
02:08:07,319 --> 02:08:08,809
Board!

1808
02:08:08,887 --> 02:08:11,981
- Better get goin'.
- Very shiny train.

1809
02:08:12,057 --> 02:08:14,491
Yeah, it sure is.

1810
02:08:14,559 --> 02:08:17,756
Now listen, Ray.
Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.

1811
02:08:17,829 --> 02:08:20,627
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

1812
02:08:20,697 --> 02:08:23,497
I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.

1813
02:08:23,567 --> 02:08:26,402

1819
02:08:41,252 --> 02:08:42,687

02:08:55,032 --> 02:08:56,467
I'll see you soon.

1821
02:08:56,537 --> 02:08:59,127
Yeah.
One for bad, two for good.

1822
02:09:03,272 --> 02:09:04,707
Bet two for good.

1823
02:09:16,887 --> 02:09:18,822
Three minutes to Wapner.
