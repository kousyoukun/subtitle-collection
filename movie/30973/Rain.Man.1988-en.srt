How many times you wash out with EPA?

30
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,943
- Just one or two more days. - Three times? You're on a roll.

31
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,279
Four cars, three times each.

32
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,782
That's zip for 12. What are you, a mechanic or a NASA engineer?

33
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,327
I told you I'd never dealt with Lamborghinis.

34
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,538
You assured me you could deliver these cars with that time frame.

35
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,957
Don't tell me that, 'cause I'm not listening.

36
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,126
Sir, I hardly think that's necessary!

37
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,796
I'll explain that to my swing loan. I'm into him for 200,000.

38
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,715
That's thousand. Three zeros.

39
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,720
I got all my money in these cars, and if I don't get my money out, I am finished.

00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,555
You have to understand our situation.

41
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,642
I got the sharks snapping at my heels here.

42
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,144
They could've taken my business 11 days ago.

43
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,647
I had to hold them off with a whip and a chair.

44
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,316
I know delivery is way overdue...

45
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,486
Fucking EPA! The world is choking on smog,

46
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,365
and they're gonna correct the situation by keeping my four cars off the road?

47
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,784
- (phone ringing) - Babbitt Collectibles.

48
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,663
Have you tried cash? How much can one of these EPA guys earn in a week?

49
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,998
- Mr. Wyatt. - Wyatt?

50
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,544
About the swing loan. He doesn't get the money by 5:30, he'll seize the cars.

51
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,965
- I'm gonna have to call you back. - Talk to Mr. Babbitt on this.

52
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:22,678
Tell him you watched me sign the check, then you gave it to the mail girl.

53
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,055
Come on, come on. I need this!

54
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,100
I wouldn't do that, sir, until you talk to Mr. Babbitt.

55
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,560
A number for him? No, he's on the road.

56
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,396
- He wants you to call him... - Charlie!

57
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,649
Tell him I'm on my way to Barbados, can he leave a number.

58
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,193
- Charlie! - What, Lenny? I'm here. Talk to me.

59
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,864
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car and wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

60
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,325
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

61
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:50,539
Tell him that was me on the other line. The paperwork will be here momentarily.

62
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,542
- You paying attention? - Yeah, I'm listening.

63
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,880
Tell them also I'm knocking off five grand for their patience, understand?

64
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,674
- Are you sure that you've got it? - I've got it!

65
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,178
Mr. Bateman? That was Mr. Babbitt on the other line.

66
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,557
As it happens, the cars are passing emissions...

67
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,520
I mean, the cars have passed emissions. We're waiting for the EPA paperwork.

68
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,733
We'll have that momentarily, and because of your incredible patience,

69
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,696
we're going to knock off $5,000 on each car.

70
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,743
Yes, you've been most patient. We really appreciate your patience.

71
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,787
Well, thank you. Thank you.

72
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,294
- Ready for Palm Springs? - Charlie, you still want to go?

73
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,589
We're seconds away from closing this deal, clearing 75 grand.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,467
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls. - Not bad at all!

75
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:48,597
- You know where to find us, right? - Right. I got it under control.

Listen, I don't wanna be demanding you,

Hmm? Consider it foreplay.

Can you include me in some of your thoughts?

81
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,887
I'm just thinking. You know, nothing special.

82
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,974
Maybe it's something we can talk about it, make a little conversation.

I just feel, I'm going away for a few days with someone. Call me crazy.

86
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,446
- OK. You wanna talk, let's talk. - I don't wanna talk!

87
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:51,159
I feel you're excluding me from what's going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

One of these again. How did we get back to one of these?

I don't know why I put up with all this.

90
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,669
You wanted to go to Palm Springs, and we're going.

91
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,549
- But I didn't want to go alone. - Susanna, you wanna talk, let's talk!

92
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,593

Charlie, this is Lenny. I've been trying to contact you for a while.

96
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,646
I got a long-distance call from Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.

97
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,648
He's been trying to reach you.

Your father has died, Charlie.

00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,616
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.

00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,370
- I've got his number. - That's not necessary. Anything else?

00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,873
No, that's it. If there's anything I can do...

- All right. - (hangs up)

104
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,339
- Sorry about the weekend, hon. - Charlie, the weekend?

105
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,177
I told you before, we had a falling-out a long time ago.

106
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:55,265
My mother died when I was two. Him and me, we just didn't get along.

107
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,144
- You're going to the funeral, no? - Yeah.

108
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,396
- I'm coming with you. - That's really sweet,

109
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,525
- but there's no point. - I want to. That's the point.

110
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,362
All right. Sorry, I forgot who I was talking to.

dedication to family and charity to all.

we commend to you the soul of our departed friend...

Just have to go over the details of the will tonight, then we're outta here.

118
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,881
I can wait in the car if you like.

119
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,380
(Susanna) Somebody should be watering those roses. They're dying.

120
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,259
I knew this car my whole life. Only drove it once.

121
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,512
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.

122
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,888
Only 8,000 production models made.

123
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,224
Straight Eight. Fireball Eight.

124
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,853
The first full year of the Dynaflow transmission.

125
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,814
Know it by rote.

126
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,041
(Susanna) You were his only child.

127
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:31,338
You came along when he was, what, 45 or something?

128
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:36,426
He probably thought he was never going to have a son, so he had to love you.

129
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,430
I think you're exaggerating. You were his child, his son, his blood.

130
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,476
He doesn't look like a man who doesn't love his son.

131
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,772
What are you doing looking at this? Put that away! You wanna hear a story?

132
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,900
- Don't get mad. - The convertible in the garage?

133
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,903
- His baby. That and the goddamn roses. - Buick.

134
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,031
The car was off-limits. "That's a classic," he'd say.

135
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,241
"It's not for children."

136
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:05,163
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old, for once I bring home a report card full of A's.

137
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,083
I go to my old man. "Can I take the car out?"

138
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,252
Take the guys out, sort of a victory drive.

139
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,465
He says no. I take it anyway. I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

140
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,302
You took the car with no permission? Why? Why then?

141
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,222
Because I... I deserved it.

142
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,767
Nothing I did was good enough for this guy! Don't you understand?

143
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,604
We're on Columbia Parkway, four kids, we get pulled over.

144
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,980
An accident?

145
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,483
Uh... Pulled over... Whoo-whoo-whoo!

146
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,820
- What is "pulled over"? Police? - Yes, police.

147
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,030
- Can I finish? - Yes.

148
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,951
He called in to report a stolen car, not his son took the car without permission.

149
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,120
Just stolen.

150
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,124
The other guys' dads bail them out in an hour. He left me there two days.

151
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,794
- He left you in prison for two days? - Two days.

152
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,172
Were you scared?

153
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,133
Yeah, I was scared.

154
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,803
Left home. I never saw him again.

155
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,556
Charlie, after a year we've been together,

156
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,058
this is the first time I've heard this story.

157
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,312
It's strange. I mean, how can you keep all this inside you

158
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,897
and not say anything?

159
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,485
When I was a kid and I got scared, the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

160
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,281
The Rain what?

161
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,743
One of those imaginary childhood friends.

162
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,455
- What happened to him? - Nothing. I just grew up.

163
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,250
Not so much.

164
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,670
"And I remember, too, the day you left home,

165
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:40,800
so full of bitterness and grandiose ideas, so full of yourself."

166
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:45,430
Being raised without a mother, your heart's hardness is understandable."

167
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,392
Your refusal to even pretend that you loved or respected me,

168
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,227
all these I forgive,

169
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:55,190
but your failure to write, to telephone, to re-enter my life in any way,

170
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,275
has left me without a son.

171
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,446
I wish you all I ever wanted for you. I wish you the best.

172
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,747
I hereby bequeath to my son, Charles Sanford Babbitt,

173
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,415
that certain Buick convertible,

174
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:17,378
the very car that unfortunately brought our relationship to an end.

175
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,549
Also, outright title to my prize-winning hybrid rose bushes

176
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,802
to remind him of the value of excellence,

177
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,970
and the possibility of perfection.

178
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,809
As for my home and all other property, these shall be placed in trust,

179
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,772
in accordance with the terms of that certain instrument executed herewith."

180
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,148
What does that mean, the last part?

181
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,942
It means that the estate,

182
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:43,363
in excess of $3 million after expenses and taxes,

183
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,616
will go into a trust fund for a beneficiary

184
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,201
to be named in this document.

185
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,246
- Who? Who is that? - I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

186
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,707
- Who controls the money? You? - No, he's called a trustee.

187
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,418
What is that? How does that work?

188
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,797
Forgive me, but there's nothing more I can say.

189
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,842
I'm sorry, son. I can see you're disappointed.

190
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,011
Why should I be disappointed? I got rose bushes, didn't I?

191
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,098
I got a used car. Whatshisname... What'd you call him?

192
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,016
- The beneficiary. - Right.

193
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,185
He got $3 million, but not the rose bushes!

194
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,187
I definitely got the rose bushes.

195
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,940
- Charles... - I definitely got the rose bushes.

196
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,486
- There is no need to... - To what? To be upset?

197
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,655
To be upset?

198
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,450
If there is a hell, sir, my father is in it,

199
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,413
and he is looking up right now, and he is laughing his ass off.

200
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,333
You wanna be his son for five minutes? Did you hear that letter?

201
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:42,005
- Were you listening? - Yes, sir, I was. Were you?

202
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,967
No. Could you repeat it? 'Cause I can't believe my fucking ears.

203
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,475
I was looking for you. How did it go?

204
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,854
I got what I expected.

205
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,830
Susanna, this could take a few minutes.

206
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,766
Can I help you?

207
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,937
Yes, I think you can. I have a problem with a private trust...

208
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,648
- That's a terrific suit! - Thank you.

209
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,192
My father was Sanford Babbitt...

210
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,370
(Charlie) Is this Wallbrook?

211
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,706
Excuse me, is this Wallbrook? Excuse me.

212
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,091
(woman) Dr. Bruner is in conference.

213
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,134
Would you like to wait in his outer office?

214
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,470
We'll stay here. Thank you.

215
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,071
Maybe we're not supposed to be looking around.

216
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,924
(man on TV) Good to have you here. Good luck to all three of you.

217
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,677
$20 starts you all off on a very important match.

218
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,640
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn get away from it all?

219
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:02,270
Excuse me, please. I want to watch the TV. Please.

220
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,607
For whose grandson was the presidential retreat Camp David named?

221
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,443
- Lisa? - Eisenhower.

222
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,822
For David Eisenhower. And you've got another five. Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

223
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,659
In days of yore, what would a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

224
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:21,497
- (indistinct chatter) - (woman singing)

225
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,772
(sighs) Whatever this is, I don't understand the point of secrecy.

226
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,816
This patient is an old girlfriend of my father's?

227
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:52,653
- I knew your father since you were two. - The year my mother died.

228
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,407
I'm trustee of the fund, but this hospital receives nothing.

229
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,493
Maybe that's something we could discuss.

230
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,870
I took on this burden out of loyalty to your father.

231
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,830
That's where my loyalty ends.

232
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,999
And you think I should feel that loyalty?

233
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,543
I think you feel cheated out of your birthright

234
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,838
by a man who had difficulty showing love.

235
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,175
I think if I were in your shoes I'd probably feel the same.

236
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:19,013
I was hoping you'd help me understand the right in what my father's done.

237
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,308
Because failing that, I have responsibilities of my own,

238
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,144
and they have to be met, even if that means a fight.

239
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,147
(Susanna) This is not your car, it's my boyfriend's.

240
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,567
(man) My dad lets me drive slow on the driveway. I'm an excellent driver.

241
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,071
- Are you sure you drive this car? - 'Course, only 28 miles on the odometer

242
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,281
since I drove it a week ago last Saturday.

243
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,785
- Should be more than 28 miles. - My boyfriend is coming.

244
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,373
'Course, today's Monday. I always drive the car on Saturday, never Monday.

245
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,292
- Who is this guy? - I don't know. He jumped into the car.

246
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,711
- He can jump out. - I'm an excellent driver.

247
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,632
That's good. Come on! I don't have time for this shit.

248
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,343
Why'd you let him get in? It's not a toy.

249
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,761
He says he drives this car.

250
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,013
Dad lets me drive slow on the driveway.

251
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,518
'Course, the seats were originally brown leather. Now they're pitiful red.

252
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,063
You know, these seats were brown leather.

253
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,150
- You know this car? - I know this car.

254
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,238
How do you know this car?

255
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,241
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster Straight Eight. Fireball Eight.

256
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,910
Only 8,095 production models.

257
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,664
Dad lets me drive slow. But not on Monday. Definitely not on Monday.

258
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,876
- Who's your dad? - Sanford Babbitt.

259
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,838
10961 Beechcrest Street, Cincinnati, Ohio.

260
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,841
That's my address. What is it with this guy? Hey!

261
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,594
- Who's your mother? - Eleanor Babbitt.

262
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,513
Died January 5th, 1965, after a short illness.

263
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,974
- Who the hell are you? - Uh-oh!

264
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,728
- Wait a second. Where are you going? - 13 minutes to The People's Court.

265
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:53,608
- Hold it. I want to ask you a question! - "What you are witnessing is real."

266
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,736
- Hey, I'm talking to you! - (muttering)

267
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,905
Bruner, who is this guy?

268
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,240
Raymond is your brother.

269
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,618
(Raymond muttering)

270
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,162
My brother? I don't have a brother.

271
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,876
..have your dispute settled in our forum of People's Court. Dah-dah-dah-dah.

272
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,297
People's Court. Dah-dah-dah-dah. The People's Court.

273
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,885
(man on TV) The People's Court.

274
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:26,307
Hello. I'm Doug Llewellyn, and welcome to The People's Court.

275
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,100
- (Charlie) Is he crazy? - (Bruner) No.

276
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,645
- Is he retarded? - Not exactly.

277
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,855
- But he's here. - He's an autistic savant.

278
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,941
I don't know what that means.

279
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,360
They used to be called "idiot savants".

280
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,446
They have certain deficiencies, certain abilities.

281
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,116
- He's retarded. - Autistic. Actually, high-functioning.

282
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,327
What does that mean?

283
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:51,165
There's a disability that impairs sensory input and how it's processed.

284
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,709
English here. You're talking over my head.

285
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,295
He has a problem communicating and learning.

286
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:01,842
He can't express himself, or understand his own emotions in a traditional way.

287
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,722
...with the clipboard, and after that, the dog bit him.

288
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,724
I yelled at my dog. The dog lay down...

289
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,269
There are dangers everywhere for Raymond.

290
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,438
Routines, rituals, it's all he has to protect himself.

291
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,774
Rituals. That's a good one.

292
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,278
It's the way he acts, sleeps,

293
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,656
eats, uses the bathroom, walks, talks, everything.

294
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,701
Any break from the routines, and it's terrifying.

295
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,829
- How long has he been here? - Let's see. I came here in 1960...

296
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,707
- No, how old is he? - He was 18 or 20 then.

297
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,874
I'd have to check.

298
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,752
- You've been here that long? - That's when I started.

299
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,547
'65, '75, '85...

300
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,467
I was almost three years old, and you knew I was his brother.

301
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,052
Yes, but what's the point?

302
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,390
The fuckin' point is, why didn't anyone tell me I had a brother?

303
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,103
- What would you have done about it? - I don't know.

304
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,400
Does he know how much money he's been left?

305
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,694
No, he doesn't understand the concept of money.

306
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,407
He doesn't understand the concept of money?

307
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:11,412
He's just inherited $3 million, he doesn't understand the concept?

308
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,125
That is fuckin' poetic, don't you think?

309
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,254
Good old Dad.

310
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,797
(Raymond) Then who's playing first?

311
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,591
Yes. I mean the fella's name playing first base.

312
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,637
- Who. What are you asking me for? - What is this? Why is he doing that?

313
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:33,100
Whenever he gets nervous, he does "Who's on First?", Abbott & Costello.

314
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,604
It's his way of dealing with you touching his books and stuff.

315
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,608
- So he memorized "Who's on First"? - Yeah. That among other things.

316
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,526
Raymond. Ted Kluzevski.

317
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,155
Kluszewski. Ted Kluszewski. "Big Klu". First base.

318
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:50,284
- (Susanna) He played for Cincinnati. - He was traded for Dee Fondy, 1957.

319
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,412
- Lifetime batting average 298... - He reads, huh?

320
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,332
Reads and remembers whatever he gets his hands on.

321
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,667
Oh! Oh!

322
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:03,005
Oh, Vern! V-E-R-N! 'Course, these people are going to be here all day.

323
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:07,718
This is an unannounced visit. This is definitely not a weekend visit!

324
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,054
He's getting anxious. It's OK, Ray!

325
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,264
Vern! Oh... Uh-oh. You're...

326
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,184
This is an unannounced visit.

327
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,769
He said not to touch the books.

328
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,979
- Not to touch books. - You like Shakespeare?

329
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,314
I don't know.

330
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,525
- Did you read all this? - I don't know.

331
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,986
- Did you read Macbeth? Hamlet? - I don't know. Vern!

332
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,863
- Twelfth Night? - Stop it!

333
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,365
- Yes. - Yes?

334
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,493
You read all the stories in this book,

335
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,161
and you don't know if you read the book?

336
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,288
- I don't know. V-E-R-N. - You don't know?

337
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,166
Maybe you'd better put it back.

338
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:43,629
You don't know. OK. No, Ray, take it easy, I'm not gonna...

339
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,840
I won't touch anything else.

340
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,009
It's OK, Ray. Come on. My main man!

341
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,346
Vern, my main man. My main man, Vern.

342
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,890
- (Vern) It's OK, Ray. - Yeah.

343
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,934
- My main man. - Yeah, my main man.

344
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,062
Here are your cards.

345
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,148
I'm sorry. I didn't know where you wanted me to put them.

346
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,443
Are you taking any prescription medication?

347
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,739
He likes you. That's just his way of showing it.

348
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,951
- Uh-oh. - But I touched him, he pulled away.

349
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,163
Don't take it personal. He never touched me.

350
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,958
I'm closer to him than anybody. I've known him for nine years.

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,836
(chuckles) It's not in him. If I left town tomorrow

352
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,297
and didn't say goodbye, he'd never notice.

353
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,716
- (Susanna) He wouldn't notice? - (Vern) I'm not sure,

354
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,178
but I don't think people are his first priority.

355
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:36,056
Hey, Ray, you want to go take a walk? Hmm? Ray?

356
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,146
Ray? Can he hear us when he's like that?

357
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,440
You want to show your brother your ducks?

358
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,901
'Course, it's 27 minutes to Jeopardy.

359
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,612
Don't worry, Ray. We'll bring you right back.

360
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,074
- Practically 26 minutes to Jeopardy. - We'll bring him right back.

361
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,078
(Susanna) I won't do it. I won't do it!

362
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:02,875
First of all, because of this tone of voice, this commanding...

363
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:07,379
You're upset. Just calm down. Raymond, I'm gonna talk to Susanna.

364
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,423
- Bye, Raymond. - Susanna! Just hold on.

365
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,885
I'll be right back. No, just stay.

366
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,595
Just stay there.

367
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,390
No, Raymond. Raymond. Raymond! Raymond! Just stay there.

368
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,977
Just stand still, OK? That's... that's good.

369
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,897
I'll do it if you tell me why. Why do I do... Ohh!

370
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,109
- What? - Why do I have to take the car

371
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,279
and go down there and wait for you again at the gate?

372
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,532
I've been waiting for you for days. Why?

373
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,286
It's for Raymond. The car disturbs him.

374
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,247
- That's why? - That's why.

375
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,624
- (Susanna mutters in Italian) - OK, Raymond.

376
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,388
What are you looking at, Ray? The ducks are over here.

377
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,014
I don't know.

378
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,729
Listen, our father died last week.

379
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,982
- Did they tell you? - I don't know.

380
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,527
You don't know if they told you, or you don't know what dead is?

381
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,823
That means he's gone. He's at the cemetery.

382
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,159
- Wanna go see him at the cemetery? - I don't know.

383
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,663
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go? - I don't know.

384
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:30,462
I live in Los Angeles. I thought maybe you'd like to see a Dodgers game.

385
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,925
- Go... go see the Dodgers play. - Today's an off day.

386
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,511
- We don't have to go today. - No game scheduled.

387
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,974
I just thought maybe you'd like to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

388
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,019
Fernando Valenzuela's not scheduled to pitch till Wednesday.

389
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:49,189
He's gonna pitch on Wednesday? I'm not doing anything on Wednesday.

390
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,941
- Wednesday. - Let's go to LA.

391
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,028
- Yeah. - Come on, Ray.

392
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,574
'Course, it's a long way to California,

393
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,036
and I'm definitely not supposed to be off the grounds for more than two hours.

394
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,164
- Have to be back in two hours. - Wait till you get there.

395
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,957
- People, crowds cheering. - Definitely not supposed to be.

396
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,043
- You'll love it. - Have to be back in two hours.

397
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,705
(tires drone)

398
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,085
(hums in monotone)

399
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,686
Here's the presidential suite.

400
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,480
- Dinner's at 6:30pm. - And to the left is Raymond's room.

401
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,401
- Look at this big beautiful room. - This is definitely not my room.

402
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,404
- It's just for tonight. - I have to go back to Wallbrook.

403
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,824
Little guy! Whoa! This is gonna be terrific. We're brothers.

404
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,536
Dr. Bruner wants us to spend time together. We're gonna have some fun.

405
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,582
'Course, we have tapioca pudding for dessert.

406
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,251
We can work tapioca pudding. I'm gonna call Lenny.

407
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,005
'Course, this is not my room, and the bed's in the wrong place.

408
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,466
- That's definitely not my bed. - You can move it.

409
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,844
- Where do you want it? - Should be near the window.

410
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,973
'Course, I don't have my books. 'Course, there are no bookshelves.

411
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,101
I'm definitely... I'm going to be bookless.

412
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,063
Here's a book. Big telephone book. Lot of words.

413
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,107
Lenny, pick up, will you?

414
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,067
I got $200,000 about to go in the shithouse

415
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,612
and he won't answer the phone.

416
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,490
- Six here means it's nine there. - No, three.

417
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,824
6:30pm is dinner...

418
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,827
It's three o'clock, and he doesn't answer the phone?

419
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,830
Orange soda.

420
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,957
Has to be in a can with a straw...

421
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,754
Bruner told you that you should do this? It doesn't make sense to me.

422
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,047
I know what's good for him.

423
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,319
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! V-E-R-N!

424
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,823
Oh, God. Go see what he's doing, will you?

425
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,409
- Ray? - V-E-R-N!

426
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,745
- What is it? - What's happening, homes?

427
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,914
- Uh-oh. - Everything is fine.

428
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,209
- Charlie, let's take him home. Come on. - No, he's OK.

429
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,337
Get him some dinner, he'll be OK. What'd you say, you wanted hamburger?

430
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,924
- Hamburger, Ray? Huh? - We have pepperoni pizza

431
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,050
Monday night.

432
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,845
Pizza? You get pizza in the institution?

433
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,972
'Course, Monday night's Italian night.

434
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,433
- (woman) Mitchell and Mitchell. - Get me Stu. It's Charlie Babbitt.

435
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,519
I'm sorry, he's not here.

436
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,190
- Where is he? I got a legal problem. - He's out of town until tomorrow.

437
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,276
All right, I'll call him tomorrow.

438
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,698
We're not allowed to watch TV during dinner.

439
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,950
- Definitely not. - We can watch TV here.

440
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,202
- We're allowed. - Yeah.

441
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,292
Wheel... of... Fortune! Look at this studio,

442
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,044
filled with glamorous merchandise,

443
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,131
fabulous and exciting bonus prizes.

444
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,635
A pair of cars for today's busy couple,

445
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,763
thousands of dollars in cash.

446
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:37,019
Over $150,000 just waiting to be won

447
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,772
as we present our big bonanza of cash

448
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,735
on... Wheel... of... Fortune!

449
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:49,156
Room service? 321. I'd like to order a large pizza. Pepperoni, right?

450
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,616
I don't want pepperoni.

451
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,828
That's right, a large pepperoni. How long's it gonna take?

452
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,997
Bring some beer for two, and an orange soda.

453
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,750
- You got tapioca pudding? - (man) No, sir.

454
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,669
Just bring the closest thing. All right. Right.

455
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,466
Here, Ray. Take this. Food is coming shortly.

456
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,010
- I'll be right back. - Yeah.

457
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,558
'Course, I'm going to be here for a long time, a very long time.

458
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,853
'Cause I'm gone for good... gone for good from my home.

459
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,654
(faint moaning)

460
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,960
(Susanna moans)

461
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,088
(Charlie grunts)

462
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,304
(imitates Susanna's moans)

463
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,519
(moans)

464
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,401
(moans)

465
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,583
- (Charlie grunts) - Ohh! Ohh!

466
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,299
(Susanna) Oh! Si! Si!

467
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,427
(Raymond) Si.

468
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,770
(moaning continues)

469
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,650
- (Susanna) Ohh! - (Raymond groans)

470
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,361
- (Charlie) Uhh! - (Raymond) Uh-huh.

471
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,282
- What is that? - I think Raymond is in the room.

472
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,036
- What? Raymond, are you in here? - Charlie... Charlie Babbitt.

473
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,372
Well, get out! Get out!

474
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,166
- Go! - Stop it!

475
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,126
Uh-oh.

476
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,297
- Jesus... - Stop it. Go in there with him.

477
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,176
Charlie, he's your brother. He's afraid.

478
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,096
He doesn't understand this. Come on. Go in there!

479
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,396
What were you doing in my room? What were you doing in my room?

480
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,774
- I don't know. - You don't know?

481
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,317
'Course, there were noises.

482
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,696
Those noises are none of your business. You understand? Huh?

483
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,240
Put the phone book down. Stop acting like an idiot and go to sleep.

484
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,703
- Go to sleep! - It's nine minutes to 11.

485
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,664
- Lights out at 11. - Yeah? Well, new rules.

486
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,722
You don't listen to me! This is...

487
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,767
- What are you talking about? - I asked you to apologize.

488
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,896
- You insulted him again! - Am I supposed to tuck him in?

489
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:12,526
You're his brother. They tell you today for the first time you have a brother.

490
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,153
I don't see in your face one reaction.

491
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,823
I'm not saying joy, I'm saying something!

492
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,032
You don't know what I'm going through.

493
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,204
No, you don't tell me anything.

494
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,833
- You just give me lies! Lies, lies! - Lies? What lies?

495
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,337
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you to bring him here, this is bullshit.

496
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,631
So why don't you tell me. Why is he here?

497
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,636
- Because I'm pissed at my father. - So you bring Raymond here. Why?

498
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,806
- 'Cause I got him, and they want him! - This makes no sense!

499
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,644
Raymond was left all the money, $3 million, every penny of it.

500
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,855
- So? - So I'll keep him till I get my half!

501
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,606
I deserve that!

502
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,987
What is this? Huh? Susanna?

503
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,823
- Take it easy. - I've had enough!

504
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,867
You've had enough? What does that mean?

505
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,286
- I'm leaving. - You're leaving?

506
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,247
You're leaving me now? I need you. I need you now!

507
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,251
- You need nobody. - What does that mean? What?

508
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,546
Just take it easy. What is my crime here? Huh?

509
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:19,467
You use people! You're using Raymond, you're using me!

510
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:23,180
- You use everybody! - Raymond! Raymond, am I using you?

511
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,806
- Am I using you? - Yeah.

512
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,143
Shut up! He is answering a question from a half-hour ago!

513
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,728
What good is $3 million to him?

514
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,439
It's gonna sit there for the rest of his life.

515
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,107
I need that money! You know I do.

516
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,109
You need it, so it's hardly like stealing!

517
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,570
Then what happens to Raymond?

518
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,449
He'll go back to Wallbrook, or a better place. I'll put him in a better place.

519
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,659
What's the difference? He'll be just the same!

520
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,912
- Only you'll have his money! - His money?

521
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,207
That man was my father, too. Where's my fucking half?

522
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,959
- I'm entitled to it! - You've kidnapped this man!

523
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,004
I did not take him. I did not take him. I took my half!

524
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,174
- You're crazy! - It runs in the family.

525
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,678
You're soaking wet and you're gonna leave in the middle of the night? Wait!

526
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,432
My father stuck it to me all my life. What do you want from me?

527
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,893
I want out. Out!

528
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,733
(muttering "Who's on First?")

529
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,725
(Raymond mutters "Who's on First?")

530
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,609
(muttering)

531
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,571
- Stop it. - Good morning!

532
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,491
- Coffee? - Yes. That'd be good.

533
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:11,871
Sally Dibbs. Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

534
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,751
- How did you know my phone number? - How'd you know that?

535
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:21,047
You said read the telephone book. Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

536
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:25,176
He remembers things, little things, sometimes.

537
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:29,514
Very clever, boys. I'll be right back.

538
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,434
- How'd you do that? How'd you do that? - I don't know.

539
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,186
- Did you memorize the whole book? - No.

540
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,732
- How far did you get? - "G". Gottsaken.

541
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,191
William Marshall Gottsaken.

542
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,945
- You memorized to "G"? - Yeah, "G".

543
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,282
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G? - "G". Half of "G."

544
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,244
- That's good, Ray. - Yeah.

545
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,246
- I like that. - Yeah.

546
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,210
- Are you hungry? - Yeah. Tuesday we have pancakes.

547
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,755
- That sounds good. - With maple syrup.

548
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,174
- You bet your butt. - Bet your butt.

549
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,595
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh... - They got pancakes.

550
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,265
- What is this, Ray? - 'Course, I don't have my toothpicks.

551
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,603
You don't need them. That was OK in the hotel with the pizza.

552
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,979
In here you eat with a fork.

553
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,273
- I don't have my toothpicks. - You don't need them.

554
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:26,196
- You're gonna eat with a fork. - I don't have my maple syrup either.

555
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,782
You don't see any pancakes, do you?

556
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,034
The problem is, maple syrup is not here.

557
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,038
Ray, when we order the pancakes, they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

558
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,083
Maple syrup is supposed to be on the table before the pancakes.

559
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,417
We haven't ordered yet.

560
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,088
When they bring it after, it'll definitely be too late.

561
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,175
How is that going to be too late? We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

562
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:51,471
We'll be here the entire morning with no maple syrup and no toothpicks.

563
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,308
I'm definitely not gonna... not gonna have my pancakes without...

564
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,102
- Ow! - Don't make a scene.

565
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,729
- Ow! - Stop acting like a fucking retard.

566
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,856
Uh-oh.

567
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,337
What is this? What are you writing?

568
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,007
What is it? What the fuck is this?

569
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:32,011
"Serious injury list. Charlie Babbitt."

570
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,140
"Serious injury list"? Are you fuckin' kidding me?

571
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,601
Number 18 in 1988.

572
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,564
"Squeezed and pulled and hurt my neck in 1988."

573
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,859
Squeezed and pulled and hurt your neck in 1988?

574
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,905
- Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt. - (Bruner) Where are you, son?

575
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,783
What matters is who I'm with.

576
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,661
You have to bring him back, Mr. Babbitt.

577
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,040
No problem whatsoever. That'll be $1 .5 million. I just want my half.

578
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:05,670
- Raymond, don't touch that. It's dirty. - I can't do that. You know I can't.

579
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,466
Just bring him back, and bring him back now. This is where he belongs.

580
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,969
I'm his brother. It's... it's not kidnapping here, is it?

581
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,014
He's always been a voluntary patient, but that's beside the point.

582
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:21,519
This is where he can get the best care. We're talking about his well-being.

583
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,938
Let's cut through the bullshit, OK?

584
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,232
I'm entitled to part of my father's estate.

585
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,486
If you don't want to cut a deal, I'll fly him to Los Angeles,

586
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:34,491
stick him in an institution out there, and we can have a custody battle.

587
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,995
Miss? He needs toothpicks. Can you help him? Thank you very much.

588
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:44,334
You want to battle me in the courts? Think about that, Dr. Bruner.

589
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:49,589
- Or we can cut a deal right now. - I don't think you have any idea...

590
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:54,302
Toothpicks. He needs some toothpicks. Can we just get him some toothpicks?

591
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,430
And I cannot make any money deals with you.

592
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,849
Then I'll see you in court.

593
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,981
I'll have the check. Sorry about the toothpicks.

594
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,526
Eighty-two, 82, 82.

595
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,277
Eighty-two what, Ray?

596
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,780
- How much is this? - Toothpicks.

597
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,909
It's a lot more than 82 toothpicks.

598
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:22,121
- 'Course, 246 total. - Keep the change.

599
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,125
- How many toothpicks were in there? - Um...

600
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,504
- Two-fifty. - Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

601
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,422
Two hundred forty-six.

602
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:37,720
- There's four left in the box. - 'Course, I have to get my backpack.

603
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:47,355
(man on radio) 97-X, the future of rock and roll.

604
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,108
(Ray) 97-X. Bam!

605
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,528
The future of rock and roll.

606
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,408
97-X. Bam!

607
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,661
The future of rock and roll.

608
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,832
97-X. Bam!

609
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,959
The future of rock and roll.

610
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,420
Ray, Ray, Ray. Enough already.

611
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,131
- Change the channel. - 97-X. Bam!

612
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,009
The future of rock and roll.

613
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,721
97-X. Bam!

614
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,931
The future of rock and roll.

615
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,518
Lenny, I don't care what you think. Did they say that?

616
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:31,357
You're gonna have to be more forceful. Lenny, shut up! I am in serious trouble.

617
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,193
I can't get to these cars. I can't get the money.

618
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,196
Do you understand that? My loan is past due!

619
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,159
(Lenny) I'll call the loan office and tell them we have a little problem.

620
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,537
- Charlie. Let me talk to Wyatt... - Lenny, just listen.

621
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,789
I'll be in LAX in three hours.

622
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,835
Remember, the Buick is in A-3, main terminal.

623
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,422
Make sure they pick it up. All right. See you in a few.

624
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,055
(woman over PA) Will Dr. Baker, Dr. Angus Baker,

625
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,974
please pick up a white courtesy phone.

626
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,602
Raymond, let's go. Come on.

627
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,648
Ray! Ray! Let's go. Come on.

628
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,235
- What were you watching? - I don't know.

629
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,029
- You don't know? - No.

630
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,324
(PA) Final call for flight 1559,

631
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,535
service to Salt Lake City and Los Angeles.

632
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,829
- Now departing at gate 15. - Uh-oh.

633
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:31,250
- Uh-oh. There's an airplane out there. - And everybody's boarding. Let's go.

634
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,587
- Airline travel's very dangerous. - Don't be silly.

635
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,256
You're gonna love this. Trust me. Come on.

636
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,258
Oh, no.

637
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,970
Ray, we're in an airport. People fly out of airports.

638
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,556
What did you think we were doing here?

639
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,600
In 1987, there were 30 airline accidents.

640
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,937
211 fatalities, 230 definitely passengers.

641
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,605
This plane is very safe.

642
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,191
I've got to get to LA, and I don't have time for this shit.

643
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,528
- I-I-I don't know. - You don't know?

644
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,488
- No. - Is it this airline?

645
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,781
- Yeah. - Is it this airline?

646
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:06,077
OK. Fine. We can, uh... There's an American plane.

647
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,498
American flight 625 crashed April 27th, 1976.

648
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:15,128
- We don't have to take American. - Yeah, pick another airline.

649
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,295
Continental.

650
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,215
Continental crashed November 15th, 1987.

651
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,094
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

652
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,138
- This is very serious. - Very serious.

653
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:29,809
I have to get to Los Angeles. So you're gonna get on that plane, understand?

654
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,187
- You're gonna have to get on a plane. - Yeah, get on a plane.

655
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,233
- Now, there's a... there's a Delta. - Yeah.

656
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,236
It leaves at midnight. But how's Delta?

657
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,698
Delta crashed August 2nd, 1985. Lockheed L-1011.

658
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,783
Dallas-Fort Worth. Terrible wind shear...

659
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:50,496
All airlines have crashed at one time or another.

660
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,124
- That doesn't mean they are not safe. - Qantas.

661
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,002
Qantas never crashed.

662
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,213
- Qantas? - Never crashed.

663
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,010
- That's going to do me a lot of good. - Never crashed.

664
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,596
Qantas doesn't fly to LA out of Cincinnati.

665
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,348
You've got to get to Melbourne, Australia,

666
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,226
to get the plane that flies to Los Angeles!

667
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:16,397
Canberra's the capital, 16.2 million population, very lovely beaches.

668
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,233
You and I are gonna get on this fucking plane!

669
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,280
(screams)

670
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,954
We're not gonna take the plane. He's OK!

671
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,374
We're not gonna take the plane. Just...

672
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,336
Just relax. He was upset.

673
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:42,715
We're not gonna take the plane. We're not gonna fly, OK?

674
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,717
No flying.

675
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,473
- We're not gonna fly. - No flying.

676
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,725
- You tire me, Ray. - Yeah.

677
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:57,480
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles. We're gonna drive to LA. OK? Come on.

678
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,025
Ray, come on. Come on. Here.

679
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,445
- No flying. - Just grab the fucking bag.

680
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,531
No flying.

681
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,743
You're killing me, man. I just want you to know, you are killing me.

682
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,247
I gotta be in LA in three hours, it's gonna take me three days.

683
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,249
Come on.

684
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,462
- No flying. - No flying.

685
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:28,636
- 'Course, I got Jeopardy at 5:00. - Don't start with that, Ray.

686
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,888
Got Jeopardy at 5:00.

687
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,092
- Dispatch, this is 109. - Go ahead, 109.

688
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,305
See if you can get another unit up here for point control.

689
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,556
10-40.

690
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,608
Uh-oh.

691
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,652
- Ray? - Yeah, there's a...

692
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,820
Get in the car!

693
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,947
There's a lot of danger on this highway.

694
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,784
Just get in the car. Are you crazy? We'll be out of this in a second.

695
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,412
That's good. It's OK.

696
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:41,667
That's right. We'll be out of here in a few seconds. That's good, Ray.

697
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:45,004
- Definitely a fatal accident. - Uh-huh. Ray?

698
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,257
Hey! We don't need your help. Go back to your car.

699
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,719
- (honking) - Just a minute!

700
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,013
Ray! Ray! Ray!

701
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,807
Ray!

702
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,230
There's nothing to see here. Go back and get in your car.

703
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,525
- Yes, sir. - Go back and get in your car!

704
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,945
Just stay there by the side, OK, Raymond?

705
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:13,491
- Listen, Ray. Just stay there! - Yeah. Definitely a lot of traffic.

706
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:19,205
Hell of a lot of work for $3 million. I should just get the hell outta here.

707
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,999
- (honking) - Yeah, I hear you!

708
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,383
Stay in your cars, please!

709
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:40,476
- What's it gonna be, Ray? - This is a very dangerous highway.

710
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,103
How am I gonna get to LA?

711
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,480
'Course, this interstate's very dangerous.

712
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,274
- You want to get off the highway? - Yeah.

713
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,193
Well, you gotta get in the car!

714
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:54,490
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers were definitely involved in fatal accidents.

715
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,412
I got an idea. I got a great idea.

716
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,039
Stay in front of the car till we get off the exit.

717
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,418
You'll get in, and we'll take a not-so-dangerous road.

718
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,461
- Is that an idea? - Yeah.

719
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,881
Give me five, Ray! That's a great idea! Give me five! Yeah.

720
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,675
This guy's a fucking fruitcake.

721
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:24,854
I'm asking you who's on first. That's the man's name. Whose name? Yes.

722
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,315
Well, go ahead and tell me. Who. The guy on first. Who.

723
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,192
The first baseman. Who is on first.

724
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,947
Whose wife? Yes. After all, the man earns it.

725
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:39,285
Who does? Absolutely. What's the guy's name on first base?

726
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,872
No. What is on second base. I'm not asking who's on second.

727
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,791
Who's on first. That's what I'm trying to find out.

728
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,919
- Get the hell in the car! - Yeah, get in the car.

729
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,964
Get in the car. 'Course, I have to be in bed by 11.

730
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,467
Lights out at 11. Have to watch TV.

731
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,268
'Course, now it's almost 19 minutes to 11. I have to be in bed at 11.

732
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,687
Don't start. We're not on the interstate.

733
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,774
I'm on some shit secondary road, I gotta make up some time.

734
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,984
I gotta get to LA. I should have been there this afternoon.

735
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,903
My business needs me.

736
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,698
Definitely watch TV, but you have to be in bed at 11.

737
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,993
- Forget it. - Uh-oh. Nineteen minutes to 11.

738
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,803
This is a good one. "We don't go out when it rains."

739
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,513
I hope you appreciate this,

740
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,848
because my business is going down the fucking toilet.

741
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,517
I should be in LA.

742
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:48,270
Instead, I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel, Bumblefuck, Missouri,

743
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,898
because you won't go out when it rains.

744
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,360
It's mystifying. Fuckin' mystifying.

745
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,449
What is this? Good news, bad news?

746
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,119
We passed DOT but failed EPA.

747
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,579
It all ends up the same. I can't get my money.

748
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:10,376
I'm stuck in Cincinnati since the funeral. So many left over details.

749
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:14,213
My family is, needless to say, quite overwhelmed.

750
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:19,176
Well, thank you. I appreciate it. It is a shock, to say the least.

751
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,596
Thank you. Can I get an extension on that loan?

752
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,975
Just a couple of days would make a world of difference.

753
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,818
"We don't go out when it's raining."

754
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,112
(rock music soundtrack on TV)

755
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:44,034
What? Speak up, Lenny. I bought time. I didn't buy that kind of time.

756
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:47,288
- You're gonna have to... How much? - It's 12:30.

757
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,540
- What? - Lunch is 12:30.

758
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,543
- What do you want for lunch? - Wednesday's fish sticks.

759
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,547
- Green lime Jell-O for dessert. - You want another apple juice?

760
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,341
Orange soda. Oh! It's 12:31.

761
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,552
I gotta go. He's starting to rock and moan.

762
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,846
- Definitely 12:31. - It's OK.

763
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,558
- You'd better give me that gun. - Where is he?

764
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,603
- Where is he? - How did you figure to frame him?

765
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,856
Framed? Who's been framed?

766
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,651
Four fish sticks. There's supposed to be eight. There's only four.

767
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,279
Eight? There's eight.

768
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,448
Take a shower, Ray? Hm?

769
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,868
- Ray. You take a shower, right? - Yeah.

770
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:31,123
It's the same thing as the rain. You get a little wet. What do you say? Huh?

771
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,460
'Course, the shower's in the bathroom.

772
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,086
That's the end of that conversation.

773
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:40,341
- Go again. - British Poetry for 200, please.

774
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,969
Shakespeare wrote over 150 poems in this 14-line form.

775
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,429
"What is a sonnet?"

776
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:49,808
What is a sonnet? Let's try Double Letters for 200, please.

777
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,269
The last word in the pledge of allegiance.

778
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,938
- Mark. - What is "stands"?

779
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,775
Stu, legally, Bruner never established

780
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,153
a conservatorship of Raymond?

781
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,240
He didn't figure anyone would contest his authority.

782
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:09,620
If that's the case, I definitely will get custody and the $3 million.

783
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:14,041
You set up a date... you set up a date for the custody hearing.

784
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,752
Stu, I want a firm date, and I want it early.

785
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,507
It wasn't an original record, because the original song had two verses...

786
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,593
Lenny, she hasn't come in? She hasn't called?

787
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,055
If you see her or hear from her, tell her to call me.

788
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,516
(banging on TV)

789
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,946
The Air Alpha Force. From Nike.

790
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,743
Would you look at that. 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.

791
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,998
Zero to 60 in under eight seconds, 275 supercharged horsepower.

792
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,625
- Beautiful. - I'm an excellent driver.

793
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,420
- You know how to drive? - Yeah.

794
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,006
- When did you drive? - I drove the Buick

795
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,717
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

796
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,470
- Was Dad in the car, Ray? - Yeah.

797
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,351
- He let you drive the Buick? - Yeah, slow, on the driveway.

798
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,022
We'll have to let you drive sometime.

799
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,441
- (Raymond sounds horn) - Raymond!

800
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,902
Never touch the steering wheel when I'm driving! You hear me?

801
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,114
Yeah. 'Course, I don't have my underwear.

802
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,449
- What? - I'm definitely

803
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,534
not wearing my underwear.

804
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,329
- I gave you a fresh pair of mine. - Not my underwear.

805
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,790
I told you to put them on. Where are they?

806
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,084
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

807
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:43,088
- Where? - Here. These... these are too tight.

808
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,966
- I don't want them back. - These are not boxer shorts.

809
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,261
- What's the difference? - These are Hanes 32.

810
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,598
My boxer shorts have my name in. It says "Raymond."

811
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,892
We'll pick you up a pair of boxer shorts.

812
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,811
I get mine in Kmart, Cincinnati.

813
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,980
We're not going back to Cincinnati.

814
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:04,485
- Four hundred Oak Street. - You don't have to go to Cincinnati.

815
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,696
- That's Oak and Burnett. Kmart. - What did I say, Ray?

816
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:12,451
You hear me. I know you hear me! You don't fool me with this shit.

817
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,288
- Yours are too tight. - Ray, did you fuckin' hear what I said?

818
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,874
- Shut up! - Yeah.

819
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:25,923
Cincinnati's a long way off. We're getting further away from Kmart.

820
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,717
You don't have to go to Cincinnati to get underwear.

821
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,805
- Kmart. 400 Oak Street. - We are not going to Cincinnati.

822
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,641
- I get my boxer shorts at Kmart. - Did you hear me?

823
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,518
I don't wanna be shortless.

824
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,189
(Charlie yells)

825
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,818
I'm going out of my mind! Out of my mind!

826
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:50,489
What difference does it make where you buy underwear?

827
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,951
What difference does it make? Underwear is underwear!

828
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,913
It is underwear wherever you buy it! In Cincinnati or wherever!

829
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,625
- Kmart. - You know what I think, Ray?

830
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,002
I think this autism is a bunch of shit!

831
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,172
'Cause you can't tell me you're not in there somewhere!

832
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:13,011
(Raymond) Boxer shorts. Boxer shorts at Kmart.

833
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:17,724
These are Hanes 32. Mine are boxer shorts.

834
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,352
You're driving me crazy. We'll have to make a stop, find a psychiatrist.

835
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,355
- 'Cause you are driving me crazy. - Oak and Burnett.

836
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,733
We have to buy them at Kmart. Oak and Burnett.

837
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,572
Uh-oh! 'Course, your shorts are on the highway.

838
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,865
Let's go back to Cincinnati and Kmart.

839
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,201
(train horn)

840
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,877
(bell ringing)

841
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,519
Good luck trying to find a shrink in this town.

842
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,552
Raymond?

843
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,173
(honking)

844
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,055
Hey, you! Dipshit! Move it!

845
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:27,854
You ain't gonna move, I'll move you. Hey, buddy! Hey, you!

846
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,649
- You're gonna get run over. - Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

847
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,778
You're gonna get hurt. Hey, you hear me? Hey! Hey!

848
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:38,115
- Move it! - Hey! It's all right! It's all right!

849
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,618
I'm sorry. He's from out of town. Raymond, come on.

850
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,496
- It's all right. - Got to get to Kmart.

851
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,832
Raymond, Raymond, Raymond. Come on.

852
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,875
Kmart. 400 Oak Street.

853
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,086
- It said "Don't Walk." - Yes, it's broken.

854
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,589
(honking)

855
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:59,386
I have to get to Kmart. 400 Oak and Burnett. Oak and Burnett.

856
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,725
He said, "Young man, go West. Go West."

857
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:09,354
This is the way our country developed, from the East Coast to the West Coast.

858
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,232
During that period of time...

859
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
(camera clicks)

860
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,278
...there was initiated

861
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,780
what is known as the Pony Express.

862
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,868
I'm sure all of you have read something about it.

863
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,871
I may not have the days exactly right, or the years,

864
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:30,167
but I'm more or less familiar with the history of the United States,

865
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,545
- and I'd love to tell you the story... - He's artistic?

866
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:37,966
- No. He's autistic. - I'm not familiar with that.

867
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,968
What is the exact nature of the problem?

868
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,930
Well, he lives in a world of his own.

869
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,643
I'm sorry, but what's wrong with him?

870
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:52,689
- It was a problem getting mail... - Raymond, do "What's on First?"

871
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,317
Who's on first. What's on second.

872
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:01,073
They set up a national program,

873
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,534
where a Pony Express would ride

874
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,746
for approximately 20 miles...

875
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,293
(Charlie) What am I supposed to do? There's gotta be something I can do.

876
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,253
I'm not a psychiatrist,

877
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:20,133
but I do know his brain doesn't work like other people.

878
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:23,095
If he's getting on your nerves, just take a break.

879
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,596
Spend some time away from him.

880
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,932
- Sure. I'll just send him back. - Sorry?

881
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,101
Nothing. It's just an... inside joke.

882
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,103
You're telling me I just have to deal with this stuff?

883
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:35,023
- I just got to deal with it. - Yeah, that's about it.

884
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,608
(Charlie sighs)

885
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,861
Out of curiosity, does he have any special abilities?

886
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,450
He's got a pretty good memory. He counts toothpicks.

887
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,786
- Huh? - They spilled a box of toothpicks,

888
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:52,958
and he took one look at 'em and counted them in seconds.

889
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,585
- Ray! Raymond! - Yeah.

890
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:59,464
- Are you good with numbers? - Yeah.

891
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,299
I want to try something here.

892
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,011
- Kmart, 400 Oak Street. - I told you, after this. After this.

893
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,556
- Ray, can we try something? - Yeah.

894
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:13,603
Do you know how much 312... times... 123 is?

895
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,564
38,376.

896
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,275
- He's right. - What?

897
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,693
He's right.

898
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:24,531
Ray, how much is 4,343

899
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,701
times 1,234?

900
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,870
5,359,262.

901
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,664
- He's a genius. - That's right.

902
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,832
He's a genius.

903
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,296
Ray, do you know how much the square root of 2,130 is?

904
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:43,800
46.15192304.

905
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,720
- (Raymond) 2304. - (Charlie) That's amazing.

906
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:50,390
That is amazing. He should work for NASA or something.

907
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,812
If you had a dollar, and you spent 50 cents,

908
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,023
how much money would you have left?

909
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,195
About 70.

910
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,406
- Seventy cents? - So much for the NASA idea.

911
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,326
- Kmart. Should go to Kmart. - After this, Ray.

912
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,536
- Ray. - 400 Oak Street.

913
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,580
Ray, do you know how much a candy bar costs?

914
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,958
- About $100. - $100, huh?

915
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,669
- Yeah. - How about a new compact car?

916
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,713
About $100.

917
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,384
In his case, he's pretty well-off. He's very high-functioning.

918
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:30,764
Most autistics, they can't speak and they can't communicate.

919
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,432
- Ray! - Yeah.

920
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,101
- Do you know what "autistic" is? - Yeah.

921
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,229
- You know that word? - Yeah.

922
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,899
Are you autistic?

923
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,694
I don't think so.

924
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,823
No, definitely not.

925
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,664
(Charlie) Lenny, shut up. Let me see if I understand this.

926
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,459
- (Raymond) Very small here. - It's $10,000 additional for each car?

927
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:03,547
- 'Course, it's very crowded. - Ray, please. One little second.

928
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:04,965
Huh? What?

929
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:09,594
They want to take out the manifold to put in a fuel injection system? Now?

930
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,304
That is nonsense!

931
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:15,267
What are you doing? Just leave this on!

932
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:19,312
It's gonna cost $40,000 just to meet EPA now! What?

933
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,817
No, no, no. You give me the number, and I'm gonna call the conversion shop.

934
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,777
That's my pen and my book.

935
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,280
Taking your book is not a serious injury.

936
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:32,492
- Serious injury goes in the red book. - Forgive me. I've lost my decoder ring.

937
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,786
- 4-5-4-5. - You're already number 18.

938
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,038
- In 1988. - 'Course, that's my book.

939
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,165
That's my pen.

940
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:42,252
Uh-oh. Twelve minutes to Wapner. It's definitely very small in here.

941
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,463
Small and safe. You don't wanna miss the party.

942
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:49,426
- "What you are witnessing is real." - There's a party in your honor, Ray.

943
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:54,055
When we get to LA, a little custody hearing. Know why there's a party?

944
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,517
- 'Cause you're the $3 million man. - "What you are witnessing is real."

945
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,770
- Ken Aldorf. Charlie Babbitt. - Uh-oh. Fart.

946
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:04,107
Charlie Babbitt. I'll hold.

947
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,483
Did you fart, Ray?

948
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,485
- Did you fucking fart? - Fart.

949
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,279
Oh, man!

950
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:14,367
- How can you stand that? - I don't mind it.

951
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,662
- Yeah, Ken? It's Charlie Babbitt. - Ten minutes to Wapner.

952
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:23,752
We're definitely locked in this box with no TV. The People's Court.

953
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,339
- How could this happen? - People's Court starts on the...

954
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:31,968
They start on the button. Definitely on the button.

955
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,346
I got a problem. I'll have to call you back.

956
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,599
We're definitely not gonna make it. We're not gonna make it.

957
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,895
- We definitely have to go now. - Yes, we're going. Just take it easy.

958
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:46,191
- Where am I gonna find a television? - Three minutes to Wapner.

959
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,693
We've got eight minutes to Wapner.

960
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,798
(Charlie) Come on. You want to get in there and see the show? Huh?

961
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,009
Want to get in there and see the show? Then listen up.

962
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,721
Not another farmhouse in sight. This is it, man.

963
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,060
You act weird, we don't get in. Are you listening to me?

964
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,522
I want you to look normal. As normal as possible.

965
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,566
- Just... Put your hands down. - Four minutes to Wapner.

966
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,778
Just shut up. Shut up and stand there.

967
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,490
Raymond? Don't rock and moan. Put your hands down.

968
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:42,497
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm from the AC Nielsen Company.

969
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,501
- You're familiar with our work? - You mean the TV ratings?

970
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:52,298
That's exactly it. You're a preliminary candidate to be the next Nielsen Family.

971
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:55,385
- My husband's not home... - You'll share the responsibility

972
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:59,180
for shaping television programming viewed by our entire nation,

973
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:04,019
in return for which you'll receive a check in the amount of $286 each month.

974
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,773
- Who's he? - That'd be my partner, Mr. Bainbridge,

975
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,942
- who does... - Dah-dah dah-dah dah-dah...

976
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:16,448
- (TV) Stay tuned for People's Court. - That's it! You blew it.

977
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,284
- It's finished! - One minute to Wapner!

978
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:24,330
One minute to Wapner, one minute to Wapner. I had you in there, Ray!

979
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,751
- Dad-dah dah-dah... - You had it all!

980
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,919
They are in there making legal history!

981
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,046
(moans)

982
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,881
- Legal history! - Oh, boy!

983
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,300
- Oh, boy! - What is going on out here?

984
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,178
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied. I'm very sorry about that.

985
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:44,059
That man is my brother. If he doesn't watch People's Court, he'll throw a fit.

986
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:48,313
You can help me, or you can stand and watch it happen.

987
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,733
We like to watch cartoons. Do you think he'd settle for that?

988
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,278
...then she sees an identical twin.

989
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,448
True, he didn't have his shirt on. The other one did.

990
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,408
But they sure look alike to me.

991
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,329
- (woman) Honey, I've got Monkey Man. - (child crying) I want my daddy!

992
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,248
Daddy's not here right now, darling.

993
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,460
Come here. Here, sweetheart.

994
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:19,260
Listen, Ken, work with me on this one. I'll take care of it.

995
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:23,807
- (sings) You know that song? - ...so my judgment

996
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,850
is for the defendant.

997
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:34,359
We'll be back right after these messages.

1019
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,413
- Just a couple of more days. - Yeah. Then who's playing first?

1020
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,540
The fella playing first base for St. Louis?

1021
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,918
You gonna start with this again?

1022

1024
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,384
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Who's on first.

1025
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:29,432
No. You know, Ray, this is not... It's not a riddle.

1026
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,643
You know the fella's name? Then who's playing first?

1027
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,605
You're never gonna figure out who's on first base, 'cause Who is on first base.

1028
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,482
That's the joke. It's comedy.

1029

Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it. Whose wife?

1030

Every dollar of it.

1031
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:46,658
- Have you got a first baseman? - It's an Abbott & Costello routine.

1032
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:51,621
When you do it, you're not funny. You're the comedy team of Abbott & Abbott!

1033
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:55,250
Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it. Whose wife? Yeah.

1036
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,468

1037
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,595
you might get better.

1038
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,223
All I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base?

1039
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:14,227
What's the guy's name on first base? No, What's the guy's name on second base.

1040
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:18,523
Have you got a first baseman on first? Yeah. Then who's playing first? Yeah.

1041
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,818
Who's playing... You know the fella's name? Yeah.

1042
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,196
Then who's playing first? Yeah. The fella playing first base for St. Louis.

1043
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,700
Who? The guy on first. Who, the first base? Who is on first.

1044
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:32,203
What are you asking me for? Have you got a first baseman on first?

1045
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:36,374
All right, come on. We'll put the bed by the window the way you like it.

We've got your apple juice,

1047
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,920
we'll take the pens and paper out and put it on the table.

1048
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,383
- What's the matter? I forget something? - Cheese balls.

1049
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,636
- Definitely cheese balls. - I forgot cheese balls.

1050
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:53,182
I have to have 12 cheese balls. Have to get my tartar control toothpaste.

1051
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,977
- I got that a couple of days ago. - Where's my toothpaste?

1052
01:11:58,355 --> 01:11:59,564
Raymond.

1053
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,610
Remember when that doctor asked you the number questions?

1054
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,322
- Yeah. - How did you do that?

1055
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,990
- (mumbles) I see it. - Huh?

1056
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,743
- I see it. - What's that?

1057
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,245

01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:44,555
You seeing that, Ray? You catching that?

1212
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:46,723
Yeah. Falling on the ground.

1213
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:53,397
OK. Now, what... what do I have left?

1214
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,649
Two jacks, one eight, one king, one six,

1215
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:59,486
two aces, one ten, one nine, one five.

1216
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:03,574
One five. You are beautiful, man!

1217
01:26:26,806 --> 01:26:28,640
- (Raymond) I'm an excellent driver. - (Charlie) You can't drive now.

1218
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:30,767
Listen, this is very important.

1219
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:34,521
When there's lots of tens left, it's good for us.

1220
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,940
- Say it. "Tens are good." - "Tens are good."

1221
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:40,152
- And you're gonna bet one... - One if it's bad,

1222
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,113
- two if it's good. - That's right.

1223
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:47,451
- Now, casinos have house rules. - Yeah.

1224
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,453
The first one is, they don't like to lose.

1225
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:53,790
So you never, never show that you are counting cards.

1226
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:58,462
That is the cardinal sin, Ray. Are you listening? That's very important.

1227
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:03,425
- Yeah. Counting... counting is bad. - Yes, counting is bad.

1228
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:07,304
- I like to drive slow on the driveway. - You get this right, Ray,

1229
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,474
you can drive wherever you want, as slow as you like.

1230
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,476
I'm an excellent driver.

1231
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:48,553
(PA) Miss Sue Morgan, please pick up the hotel courtesy phone.

1232
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,142
Raymond.

1233
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,064
(bell rings)

1234
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,832
(bell rings)

1235
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:37,829
- Rain Man, let's play some cards. - Yeah.

1236
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:50,675
- You want a hit? - No, you don't. You've got 18.

1237
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:52,803
- I want a hit. - Sir, you have 18.

1238
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,389
- He doesn't want a hit. - I want a hit.

1239
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,974
- Hitting 18. - Hit me, hit me, hit me!

1240
01:29:58,142 --> 01:29:59,810
Don't...

1241
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:05,023
You took my queen. I've got a ten. I needed that queen. I can't take it!

1242
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:08,568
- Sir, please don't touch the cards. - I need my own queen.

1243
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,529
There's lots of them.

1244
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:14,032
- There's lots of them? - Lots and lots.

1245
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,243
Hold on here for a second.

1246
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,373
I'm gonna double down.

1247
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,794
(Raymond) Queen, queen, queen.

1248
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,297
Yes, sir, you gotta love this town.

1249
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:34,553
- I'm going for it, Nick. - It looks like it.

1250
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,304
It certainly looks like it.

1251
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,031
- Wanna bet one chip or two chips? - Bet two.

1252
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,118
Bet two?

1253
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,542
- Hey, what's your secret, guys? - We cheat.

1254
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,877
(laughter)

1255
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:52,589
This is Sam. Tape table 47.

1256
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:02,349
- About 85,000. - 85,000?

1257
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,809
- Did you call the eye in the sky? - Sam did.

1258
01:32:04,977 --> 01:32:07,145
- OK, I'll take over. - All right.

1259
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:15,529
All right!

1260
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,949
You're doing well. I'm happy for you, sir.

1261
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,456
- What do you see? - He's not catching the hole card.

1262
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:30,418
- He's not past posting us. - I don't see him using a computer.

1263
01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:34,881
He's not, but something's not right. No one can count into a six-deck shoe.

1264
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,834
Hold it. Hold it here. Uh...

1265
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,504
Watch my chips. I'll be back in a second.

1266
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:15,672
Go ahead, sir.

1267
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:22,554
Ray, we're in the middle of a hand. You don't leave in the middle of a hand.

1268
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:25,974
Come on! We are hot. The Babbitt brothers, kicking ass in Vegas!

1269
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:29,519
- Wheel of Fortune. - Cleopatra and Caesar are waiting!

1270
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:33,189
- "Look at this glamorous merchandise." - One for bad, two for good.

1271
01:33:33,357 --> 01:33:34,816
- Twenty. - Twenty?

1272
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:39,029
- You mean it's gonna hit on 20? - Yeah, 20. Definitely 20.

1273
01:33:39,196 --> 01:33:41,031
$3,000 on 20.

1274
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,659
- Definitely 20. - Definitely 20?

1275
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:46,369
Yeah.

1276
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:54,210
Uh-oh.

1277
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:59,382
It's not your game, Ray. I just lost $3,000.

1278
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:02,510
- Yeah. - That's $3,000 I lost. Come on, Ray.

1279
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:03,887
A little black...

1280
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:07,307
No? Easy. Don't start banging yourself.

1281
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,352
- Maybe we'll play a little bit later. - Yeah.

1282
01:34:10,519 --> 01:34:12,771
- Let me cash in. - Yeah. Cash in.

1283
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,898
You make me sad, Ray.

1284
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:17,984
Twenty.

1285
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,531
We won $86,000 and some change, right, Ray?

1286
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:28,536
- $86,500. - $80,000 refund on the car payments,

1287
01:34:28,704 --> 01:34:32,832
and I owe... What'd I say I owe to get the Rolex back?

1288
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,169
- $3,500. Six months to pay. - $3,500.

1289
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,756
We don't have to pay for the room, that's comped. I'm free and clear.

1290
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,092
I'm gonna take a celebration piss.

1291
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:47,847
Don't go anywhere. Until I get back, the sign says "Don't Walk."

1292
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,266
- "Don't Walk." - "Don't Walk."

1293
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:10,578
Hey.

1294
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:14,541
You looking for a date? Are you?

1295
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,626
- I don't know. - What's your name?

1296
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:19,170
- Raymond. - My name is Iris.

1297
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:23,133
- Raymond, you like me? - I don't know.

1298
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,845
You don't know? I think if you gave me a chance, you would.

1299
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:29,180
Why don't we try to get to know each other?

1300
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:32,642
- Yeah, get to know each other. - He doesn't have any money, honey.

1301
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,855
That's all right, sugar, 'cause we are just talking.

1302
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:41,985
- Yeah, we're just talking. - Let's go upstairs. What are you doing?

1303
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,612
Getting to know each other. Just talking.

1304
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,574
- What room? I'll bring him up. - That's all right.

1305
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:51,244
Is that what you wanna do? Get to know each other?

1306
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,997
Yeah. Get to know each other. Just talking.

1307
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:58,543
This will be interesting. I'll be over here just in case.

1308
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:03,298
- He doesn't seem to like me. Who is he? - He's my brother.

1309
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:08,261
- He seems young to be your brother. - He was born August 12th, 19... 1962.

1310
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,679
It was a Sunday.

1311
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,475
What exactly do you guys do here?

1312
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:17,729
- We're counting cards. - You're counting cards?

1313
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:20,982
- We're counting cards. - Uh-huh.

1314
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:24,068
- We're counting cards. - What else do you do?

1315
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,698
- We're counting cards. - I know. What else do you do?

1316
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,825
Are you taking any prescription medication?

1317
01:36:30,993 --> 01:36:34,913
Whoa. Look, I'm outta here.

1318
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,373
- 'Course, what time is the date? - Later.

1319
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:39,042
- What time? - It's 10:00!

1320
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,628
I have to be in bed at 11. Lights out at 11.

1321
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:46,216
10:00, daylight saving time. 10:00, daylight saving time.

1322
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:49,719
10:00? You like her, Ray? You think she's pretty?

1323
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:53,097
- Yeah. She's very sparkly. - Definitely very sparkly.

1324
01:36:53,265 --> 01:36:54,641
Very sparkly.

1325
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:00,730
He did a great job on that suit. You don't realize how good you look.

1326
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:02,732
- Do you like it? - It's not Kmart.

1327
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:07,904
How could you not like that suit? You look fantastic. How can you not like it?

1328
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,740
- It's not a Kmart suit. - I'll let you in on a secret.

1329
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,743
- Kmart sucks, OK? - Yeah.

1330
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,458
There you go, Ray. It's the high-rollers' suite.

1331
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:24,420
This is for you. You ever seen a room like this before?

1332
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:27,215
- Yeah. - What's up there?

1333
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,551
What's up there? Ray, you're not even looking.

1334
01:37:29,718 --> 01:37:32,303
- Yeah. Bed. - That's a bed. That's your bed.

1335
01:37:32,471 --> 01:37:35,807
I had 'em put it up there. Right by the window, the way you like it.

1336
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:38,142
- Go on up. - Yeah.

1337
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:40,645
- Just the way you like it, isn't it? - Yeah.

1338
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:47,485
Look at you with all those lights. Mr. Vegas. You are Mr. Las Vegas now!

1339
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:50,780
- What do you think? - There's a lot of lights.

1340
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:54,951
- It's very sparkly. Very twinkly. - We made a lot of money today, Ray.

1341
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,120
We made a lot of money!

1342
01:37:57,288 --> 01:38:01,374
Forgetting the $3,000 we tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

1343
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:05,420
- Yeah, Wheel... Wheel of Fortune. - I'm sorry about that.

1344
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:09,340
I got a little carried away. I got a little hot, OK, Ray?

1345
01:38:09,508 --> 01:38:10,592
Yeah.

1346
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:14,804
I'm saying I'm sorry, and I just want you to know that I am sorry.

1347
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:20,268
I'm apologizing. I got a little carried away.

1348
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:24,314
The money... I got a little... I got a little greedy.

1349
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:28,109
- You wanna say something? - I have to be at the bar at 10:00.

1350
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:31,029
'Cause I got to thank you, man. You, uh...

1351
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:36,326
You did it. You did it. I was just there.

1352
01:38:36,493 --> 01:38:40,371
You saved my ass. I'm just... just along for the ride.

1353
01:38:40,539 --> 01:38:44,500
Have to be at the bar at 10:00. Have to go to a date with Iris.

1354
01:38:44,668 --> 01:38:47,921
Iris, that's her name, yeah. Big date. Gonna go dancing.

1355
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:51,674
Yeah, dancing. Have to go to a date with Iris at the bar dancing.

1356
01:38:51,842 --> 01:38:53,760
- You know how to dance? - I don't know.

1357
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,638
- You ought to learn some time. - Yeah.

1358
01:38:56,805 --> 01:38:59,057
Have to learn to dance for the date.

1359
01:38:59,224 --> 01:39:03,019
- Have to learn to dance for the date. - I was just kidding.

1360
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:06,481
- You're not gonna have to dance. - I have to learn to dance.

1361
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:09,984
- Definitely. Now. - You don't have to dance now.

1362
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:11,903
I'll teach you how to dance sometime.

1363
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:14,864
- Definitely have to. - No. You won't have to dance.

1364
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:18,117
- Definitely have to learn. - I'm sorry I even brought this up.

1365
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:21,412
- All right, Ray. My mistake. - 10:00.

1366
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:24,540
You got the only famous dancing hooker in Vegas.

1367
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,917
Stand over there.

1369
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:35,718
- Come over here. - Yeah.

1370
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,180
- You hear the music? - Yeah.

1371
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:43,476
Just watch my feet. Raymond, watch my feet.

1372
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,979
Just do what I'm doing.

1373
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:50,316
OK? You feel the rhythm of the music? We're just moving our feet like that.

1374
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:54,028
OK. Now, you're the guy, so you're gonna have to lead.

1375
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:58,616
And I'm the date, so you want to, uh...

1376
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:02,203
You wanna put your left hand up like this.

1377
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:03,538
Don't stop moving.

1378
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:05,707
- You paying attention? - Yeah.

1379
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:07,542
Put your left hand up like this.

1380
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:12,797
That's good. Don't stop moving. Just keep moving. That's good.

1381
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:16,718
Now, you wanna take this other hand, put it around behind my back.

1382
01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:18,594
- You wanna learn how to dance? - Yeah.

1383
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:23,266
Cos you gotta touch someone when you dance. I'm not gonna hurt you.

1384
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:27,437
Just put it right there. I take my hand, I put it up here.

1385
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:32,442
Watch my feet, Ray. Watch my feet. The rhythm, the rhythm.

1386
01:40:32,609 --> 01:40:34,235
All right?

1387
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:38,448
Now, when you dance, you can't watch my feet, so you'll have to look up.

1388
01:40:38,615 --> 01:40:42,952
When I tell you to, I want you to just look up, real slow.

1389
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,787
Just keep moving.

1390
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:46,456
- OK, you ready? - Yeah.

1391
01:40:46,623 --> 01:40:49,000
- All right, start looking up. - Yeah.

1392
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:53,046
A little more. Keep moving. Just a little more.

1393
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:57,633
A little more, Ray. All the way up.

1394
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:02,138
- There you go, Ray. - Yeah.

1395
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:05,016
- You're dancing. This is it. - Yeah, dancing.

1396
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:07,351
You wanna close your hand. Just...

1397
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:12,565
Pull like that, you're gonna turn me like this, OK?

1398
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,901
- Turning. - That's good.

1399
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,820
- This is dancing, Ray. - This is dancing.

1400
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:20,656
I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel a little silly.

That's it. All right! All right!

Beautiful! You are a good dancer! Wanna give me a hug?

I just wanted to give you a hug, Ray. I...

1406
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:22,635
I just felt like giving you a hug.

1407
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,777
What are you doing here?

1408
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:42,738
- I'm unemployed. - What do you mean?

1409
01:42:42,906 --> 01:42:47,160
- You don't know about the business? - Yeah, I know. Come on in. It's OK.

1410
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:52,123
I'm glad to see you.

1411

Ray, look who's here.

1412
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:22,069
It's not right what you're doing to Raymond.

1413
01:43:22,237 --> 01:43:24,405
- He's fine. - I know he's fine.

1414
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:28,284
He's in Las Vegas in a suit, in a big room.

1415
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,787
- It makes me sad. - Six minutes to my date.

1416
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:36,125
- Six minutes to Iris. - He has a date?

1417
01:43:37,502 --> 01:43:41,631

What have you gotta bring a Watchman for on a date?

1419
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:49,222
- The man's dancing. - But what does your date look like?

1420
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:52,558
She's very sparkly. She looks like a holiday.

- I don't think I've heard that one. - Mr. Babbitt?

1422
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:01,067
- Mr. Kelso would like to see you. - I don't know Mr. Kelso.

1423
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:04,445
He's director of security. Would you come with me, please?

Who is on first. You got a first baseman?

Certainly. Then who's playing first?

1498

When you pay off the first baseman, who gets the money?

(TV) Why not? The man's entitled to it.

- So who gets it? - Why should he?

- Sometimes his wife collects it. - Whose wife?

1504
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:33,417
- Yes! - Oooooh.

1505
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:35,336
- After all, he earns it. - Who does?

Absolutely.

01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:41,842
What is on second base.

1509
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:45,220
- Don't you think this is funny? - Yes, this is funny.

1510
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:52,895
- Where'd you see this first? - Dad gave me a book of baseball trivia.

1511
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:55,606
- Guess it didn't read as funny. - Definitely not.

1512
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:01,236
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner. I'd like you to call me.

1513
01:51:01,404 --> 01:51:05,157
- Yeah, what is it? - I thought I got the machine.

1514
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:07,201
- No. - I just got into town.

1515
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:10,537
As you know, the psychological interview is tomorrow.

1516
01:51:10,705 --> 01:51:14,083
- Yes, sir, I know that. - We should get together and talk.

1517
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:17,920
I really think it might be in your best interests to meet me.

1518
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:19,838
When?

1519
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:23,092
I'm at the Bonaventure. How about tonight at 8:30?

1520
01:51:23,259 --> 01:51:27,096
spring and fall
(stereo) ♪ Winter's passed,

1521
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:30,724
♪ You never wrote me

1522
01:51:30,892 --> 01:51:33,894
♪ You never called

1523
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:39,274
you've been gone too long
♪ Nathan Jones,

1524
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:50,119
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston, who's in charge of the psychiatric evaluation.

1525
01:51:50,286 --> 01:51:54,039
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond. - Well, good luck.

1526
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,959
Look, this isn't a close call. It's a formality.

1527
01:51:57,127 --> 01:51:59,336
Your brother's a very disabled individual.

1528
01:51:59,504 --> 01:52:01,797
So Marston's gonna rule against me?

1529
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:04,341
I'm telling you it's always been a lost cause.

1530
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:06,635
Then why did you call me?

1531
01:52:06,803 --> 01:52:09,888
Your father put me in charge of all the money, all right?

1532
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:12,891
And it doesn't matter whether or not you win custody.

1533
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:16,812
I won't have to pay you a dime. It's at my discretion, not the court's.

1534
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:21,150
- What, so you can't lose? - I can lose. I can lose Raymond.

1535
01:52:21,317 --> 01:52:23,944
And I care about his life and the treatment he receives.

1536
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:28,782
I made a commitment to your father, and I'm not willing to gamble with that.

1537
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:33,328
- What is this? - It's a very big check.

1538
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:38,584
$250,000.

1539
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:42,087
And no strings attached. You just walk away, Charlie.

1540
01:52:43,465 --> 01:52:48,010
You know, this isn't about you and me. It's not about winning or losing.

1541
01:52:50,305 --> 01:52:54,057
When I asked you why didn't anyone ever tell me I had a brother,

1542
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:57,269
you didn't have an answer.

1543
01:52:57,437 --> 01:52:58,854
I don't know...

1544
01:53:00,857 --> 01:53:03,192
It's funny, I just realized I'm not pissed off

1545
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:05,611
that my father cut me out of his will.

1546
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:10,824
You were his friend. You probably knew he tried to contact me.

1547
01:53:10,992 --> 01:53:13,494
I never called him back. I was a prick.

1548
01:53:13,661 --> 01:53:17,372
If my son didn't return my calls, I'd have written him out. Fuck him.

1549
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:21,210
But it's not about the money anymore. It's...

1550
01:53:21,377 --> 01:53:26,048
I just don't understand. Why didn't he tell me I had a brother?

1551
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:31,261
Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

1552
01:53:34,682 --> 01:53:35,849
Because it would've been nice to know him

1553
01:53:36,017 --> 01:53:38,936
for more than just the past six days.

1554
01:54:39,247 --> 01:54:41,790
(smoke alarm)

1555
01:55:03,646 --> 01:55:06,356
Ray, Ray, Ray!

1556
01:55:19,662 --> 01:55:22,497
- (alarm stops) - Ray! Ray!

1557
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:25,834
Ray! Come on.

1558
01:55:26,002 --> 01:55:29,338
It's stopped! It's all right.

1559
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:38,931
V-E-R-N... Vern...

1560
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:43,101
Vern... Main man... My main man. Vern.

1561
01:55:43,269 --> 01:55:46,855
Ohh... V-E-R-N... Vern.

1562
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,109
Uh-oh.

1563
01:55:52,862 --> 01:55:54,905
My main man Vern.

1564
01:55:57,742 --> 01:56:00,953
V-E-R-N. Vern, my main man.

1565
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:04,957
Raspberry, strawberry, blueberry, Pink Caddy, whole wheat, Peachy Keen,

1566
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:08,585
beernut, Rocky Road, buckwheat, Bellybuster.

1567
01:56:08,753 --> 01:56:10,879
- What kind do you want? - Pancakes.

1568
01:56:11,047 --> 01:56:13,674
- Yeah, but what kind? - Pancakes.

1569
01:56:13,841 --> 01:56:16,426
'Course, maple syrup's supposed to be on the table...

1570
01:56:16,594 --> 01:56:19,721
- Ray? Ta-da! - (chuckles)

1571
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:25,852
- Charlie Babbitt made a joke. - I made a joke.

1572
01:56:45,456 --> 01:56:47,332
Step back a little.

1573
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:09,354
Hello?

1574
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:12,774
Why don't you go sit down over there?

1575
01:57:16,612 --> 01:57:18,113
Hello?

1576
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:21,950
In this kind of legal proceeding, there's no lawyers, no judge,

1577
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:25,287
just the people who care about Raymond.

1578
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:27,039
Raymond, have a seat over there.

1579
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:28,832
Mr. Babbitt, the other side of the table.

1580
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,128
Raymond, right here. Take this seat. OK?

1581
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:34,963
Ray, put your knapsack on the floor.

1582
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:37,674
This is a good opportunity to be honest...

1583
01:57:37,842 --> 01:57:40,886
And the TV, Ray. Ray, the TV? On the floor.

1584
01:57:41,054 --> 01:57:42,637
- I'm sorry. - Yeah...

1585
01:57:42,805 --> 01:57:45,932
I don't know any easier way to say this, Mr. Babbitt...

1586
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,934
Say what? Have I lost already?

1587
01:57:48,102 --> 01:57:52,731
No, you haven't lost. I'm just a doctor making a recommendation to a court.

1588
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:56,485
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner is a very respected professional.

1589
01:57:56,652 --> 01:57:59,237
Raymond's case has been meticulously documented,

1590
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:02,491
and Wallbrook is one of the finest institutions we have.

1591
01:58:02,658 --> 01:58:05,077
You guys have made up your mind. See you in court.

1592
01:58:05,244 --> 01:58:09,539
My brother came further with me in a week than he did with you in 20 years!

1593
01:58:09,707 --> 01:58:11,333
You don't know anything about us!

1594
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:14,711
I don't think it's necessary to challenge Dr. Bruner.

1595
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:17,214
What happened this past week, Raymond?

1596
01:58:17,381 --> 01:58:19,925
- We... - I was asking Raymond.

1597
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:24,304
Raymond? What happened this past week? What did you do?

1598
01:58:24,472 --> 01:58:27,474
- Counted cards in Las Vegas. - Counted cards?

1599
01:58:27,642 --> 01:58:31,186
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas? - $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

1600
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:36,733
- He gave you $3,000 to gamble with? - Lost $3,000 on... pitiful 20.

1601
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:39,236
- What else did you do? - Bet on number 20.

1602
01:58:39,403 --> 01:58:42,197
- What else did you do? - Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

1603
01:58:42,365 --> 01:58:44,324
Danced with your brother?

1604
01:58:44,492 --> 01:58:47,202
Danced in the elevator with Susanna. Kissed Susanna.

1605
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:49,538
- You kissed Susanna? - In the elevator.

1606
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:52,165
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman? - I don't know.

1607
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:55,043
- How did it feel? - It f-f-felt wet.

1608
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:56,711
- Wet? - Yeah.

1609
01:58:56,879 --> 01:58:59,923
- Quite a trip, huh? - Yeah.

1610
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:02,592
- Do you enjoy being on the road? - I'm an excellent driver.

1611
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,719
- You drove? - Yeah.

1612
01:59:04,887 --> 01:59:08,390
- Brother let you drive on the highway? - Slow on the driveway.

1613
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:10,725
- He didn't drive on the highway. - Uh-huh.

1614
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:14,437
- Did he have any emotional outbursts? - Such as?

1615
01:59:14,605 --> 01:59:18,775
Things they tend to do. Inflicting bodily harm on themselves...

1616
01:59:18,943 --> 01:59:21,361
- OK. Yeah, a couple of times. - A couple of times.

1617
01:59:21,529 --> 01:59:25,031
OK. He had what you call an outburst because he didn't wanna fly.

1618
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:27,951
- So we didn't fly. - When was the last outburst?

1619
01:59:28,119 --> 01:59:29,828
- This morning. - This morning?

1620
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:31,246
This is bullshit.

1621
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:35,333
I could tell you anything, you'd never know the difference.

1622
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:40,088
This morning the smoke alarm went off. He got a little nervous, but...

1623
01:59:40,256 --> 01:59:43,383
- Don't feel that I'm placing blame. - We went out for pancakes.

1624
01:59:43,551 --> 01:59:44,676
Look at him...

1625
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:47,762
- You don't have to be defensive. - I'm just being honest.

1626
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:50,682
- I think you're missing the point. - I think you are.

1627
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,726
The point I was trying to make is I'm not placing blame.

1628
01:59:52,894 --> 01:59:56,021
I had a father I hardly knew, a mother I never knew,

1629
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:59,733
I find out a few days ago I have a brother, I'm supposed to give him up?

1630
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:02,527
- No one is saying anything... - I didn't hurt him,

1631
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:04,779
he's not hurting me, we're not hurting you.

1632
02:00:04,947 --> 02:00:06,948
Why are you interfering? This is my family.

1633
02:00:07,116 --> 02:00:09,951
- My family. Do you understand? - I understand.

1634
02:00:10,119 --> 02:00:11,328
You do have a brother,

1635
02:00:11,495 --> 02:00:13,830
but he's not capable of having a relationship with you.

1636
02:00:13,998 --> 02:00:15,123
That's your opinion.

1637
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:18,460
Did you spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week with him?

1638
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:21,796
You cannot take on that responsibility without guidance.

1639
02:00:21,964 --> 02:00:24,549
- That's your opinion, Dr. Bruner. - Yes, it is.

1640
02:00:24,717 --> 02:00:28,637
There's a couple of things I'd like to go over. Dr. Bruner states a week ago,

1641
02:00:28,804 --> 02:00:33,266
you stole Raymond out of the institution to trade him for $1 .5 million.

1642
02:00:33,434 --> 02:00:36,937
My father died. I was upset. That was wrong.

1643
02:00:37,104 --> 02:00:40,523
So you've suddenly found some devotion to your brother,

1644
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:43,401
- and you wanna take care of him? - Yes.

1645
02:00:43,569 --> 02:00:45,320
Mm-hm.

1646
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:48,156
So the beginning was like a kidnapping.

1647
02:00:48,324 --> 02:00:51,409
That's very strong. I didn't kidnap my brother.

1648
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:54,955
But in the course of the week, you came to have an understanding with him?

1649
02:00:55,122 --> 02:00:56,373
- Yes. - Mm-hm.

1650
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:01,795
Look, that... I understand that this sounds irrational to you.

1651
02:01:01,963 --> 02:01:06,132
- Yes, when it started out... - Don't feel compelled to be defensive.

1652
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:08,802
- Can I talk? I'd like to talk. - Yes, you can.

1653
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:12,013
- Thank you. - There's no accusations. Go ahead.

1654
02:01:12,181 --> 02:01:14,432
No accusations?

1655
02:01:15,351 --> 02:01:19,646
(sighs) You have to understand that when we started out together,

1656
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:23,692
that he was only my brother in name.

1657
02:01:23,859 --> 02:01:25,026
Mm-hm.

1658
02:01:27,738 --> 02:01:29,364
And as...

1659
02:01:32,535 --> 02:01:34,869
And this morning, we had pancakes.

1660
02:01:35,037 --> 02:01:38,790
Maple syrup. Maple syrup on the... maple syrup on the table.

1661
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:41,876
- And pancakes. - And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1662
02:01:43,629 --> 02:01:46,298
You see, we...

1663
02:01:46,465 --> 02:01:47,924
I made a connection.

1664
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:51,428
That's very admirable, but the purpose of this meeting

1665
02:01:51,595 --> 02:01:56,766
is to determine whether Raymond is capable of functioning in the community,

1666
02:01:56,934 --> 02:02:00,395
and what he wants, if that's possible to determine.

1667
02:02:00,563 --> 02:02:03,690
- I'm all for that. - Raymond can't make those decisions.

1668
02:02:03,858 --> 02:02:06,985
- You're wrong. - You know he can't decide for himself.

1669
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:11,948
- He's capable of more than you know. - Why don't we ask Raymond?

1670
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:17,078
- Can I ask you a few questions? - Ray, the doctor's talking to you.

1671
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:19,873
- Can I ask you a few questions? - Yeah.

1672
02:02:22,168 --> 02:02:25,378
Do you want to stay with your brother Charlie?

1673
02:02:25,546 --> 02:02:28,548
Raymond, would you like to stay with Charlie in Los Angeles?

1674
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:31,092
Ray? The doctor's asking you a question,

1675
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,303
- so you listen, OK? - Yeah.

1676
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:37,349
Raymond, do you want to stay with your brother Charlie?

1677
02:02:37,516 --> 02:02:40,518
- Do you want to stay with your brother? - Yeah.

1678
02:02:40,686 --> 02:02:42,937
- You do? - Yeah.

1679
02:02:43,105 --> 02:02:47,442
- You wanna stay with your brother? - Yeah. Stay with Charlie Babbitt.

1680
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,861
- That's what you want? - Yeah.

1681
02:02:51,322 --> 02:02:54,699
- You wanna stay with your brother? - Yeah.

1682
02:02:57,328 --> 02:03:00,080
- Can I ask you something else? - Yeah.

1683
02:03:00,247 --> 02:03:03,249
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook? - Yeah.

1684
02:03:03,417 --> 02:03:06,753
Can you make a distinction between your brother and Wallbrook?

1685
02:03:06,921 --> 02:03:09,506
- Yeah. - Hm?

1686
02:03:09,673 --> 02:03:14,219
Raymond, do you want to stay with Charlie here in Los Angeles,

1687
02:03:14,387 --> 02:03:15,637
or do you want to go back to Wallbrook?

1688
02:03:15,805 --> 02:03:18,306
- Yeah. - They're two separate things.

1689
02:03:18,474 --> 02:03:23,812
Stay with your brother or go back to Wallbrook? Make a choice.

1690
02:03:23,979 --> 02:03:27,649
(Raymond) Go back to Wallbrook. Stay with Charlie Babbitt.

1691
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:32,362
- Make that choice. One or the other. - Stay back to Wallbrook.

1692
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:36,074
All right, all right, just hold on a minute!

1693
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:40,328
- Stay back to Wallbrook... - All right. You've made your point.

1694
02:03:40,496 --> 02:03:45,250
You don't have to humiliate him. Ray, it's OK.

1695
02:03:45,418 --> 02:03:47,585
- It's over. - Yeah.

1696
02:03:47,753 --> 02:03:50,463
Stay back at Wallbrook with Charlie Babbitt.

1697
02:03:50,631 --> 02:03:52,841
- Stay back at Wallbrook. - It's over.

1698
02:03:53,926 --> 02:03:56,010
- Raymond? - Yeah?

1699
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:02,058
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you? Excuse me.

1700
02:04:10,651 --> 02:04:12,694
- You OK, Ray? - Yeah.

1701
02:04:14,989 --> 02:04:17,740
- You don't want any more questions. - No.

1702
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:22,495
I don't know.

1703
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:31,921
- You don't want any more questions. - No.

1704
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:40,013
Don't worry. There's not going to be any more questions. No more questions.

1705
02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:43,057
Yeah. Main man.

1706
02:04:43,225 --> 02:04:45,435
- What? - My main man.

1707
02:04:49,773 --> 02:04:51,316
Listen...

1708
02:04:54,945 --> 02:04:57,947
I really don't know if I'm gonna have a chance to talk to you again.

1709
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:05,997
Because, you see, these... Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,

1710
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:09,292
and he'll probably gonna want to take you back with him.

1711
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:12,837
- You know? - Yeah.

1712
02:05:13,005 --> 02:05:14,964
I just want you to know that what I said

1713
02:05:15,132 --> 02:05:19,761
about being on the road with you I meant. Connecting?

1714
02:05:21,555 --> 02:05:25,099
- I like having you for my brother. - I'm an excellent driver.

1715
02:05:27,394 --> 02:05:28,978
Yes, you are.

1716
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:58,841
I like having you for my big brother.

1717
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:03,137
Yeah.

1718
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:19,779
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

1719
02:06:22,992 --> 02:06:25,785
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

1720
02:06:26,662 --> 02:06:28,329
Main man.

1721
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:03,823
(PA) Your attention, please.

1722
02:07:03,991 --> 02:07:07,952
Amtrak train number 36, the Desert Wind eastbound,

1723
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:10,288
now boarding, track number three.

1724
02:07:11,665 --> 02:07:13,916
Ray? Ray!

1725
02:07:14,084 --> 02:07:18,671
...Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, Omaha, Chicago...

1726
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:26,262
- Charlie. - Dr. Bruner.

1727
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:30,058
Hello, Raymond. Wouldn't you feel more relaxed in your favorite Kmart clothes?

1728
02:07:30,225 --> 02:07:32,518
- Tell him, Ray. - Kmart sucks.

1729
02:07:32,686 --> 02:07:37,857
I see. I have the tickets, and I'll be on this car right here to the right.

1730
02:07:38,025 --> 02:07:41,277
Why don't you take a couple of minutes? See ya, Charlie.

1731
02:07:42,863 --> 02:07:45,657
- You made a joke, Ray. - Yeah. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1732
02:07:50,579 --> 02:07:54,582
I guess I'd better give this to you. You're gonna have to carry this now.

1733
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:58,795
It's... It's got your cheese balls, your apple juice,

1734
02:07:58,962 --> 02:08:04,092
notebooks, pens and the "Who's on First?" video that you like.

1735
02:08:04,259 --> 02:08:07,220
- "Who's on First?". Very funny. - I told you, it's funny.

1736
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:08,763
All aboard!

1737
02:08:08,931 --> 02:08:11,849
- You'd better get going. - Yeah. Very shiny train.

1738
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:14,435
Yeah, it sure is.

1739
02:08:14,603 --> 02:08:17,689
Listen, Ray. Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.

1740
02:08:17,856 --> 02:08:23,444
That doesn't mean I can't visit. I'm coming to see you in two weeks.

1741
02:08:23,612 --> 02:08:27,573
- How many days is that? - Fourteen days. Today's Wednesday.

1742
02:08:27,741 --> 02:08:29,450
Hours?

1743
02:08:29,618 --> 02:08:32,620
- Three hundred thirty-six hours. - Mystifying!

1744
02:08:33,872 --> 02:08:36,082
'Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

1745
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:41,129
1, 209,600 seconds.

1746
02:08:41,296 --> 02:08:42,880
Ray?

1747
02:08:44,258 --> 02:08:45,425
Ray!

1748
02:08:46,301 --> 02:08:50,138
- Ray! - Yeah?

1749
02:08:54,893 --> 02:08:56,436
I'll see you soon.

1750
02:08:56,603 --> 02:08:59,147
Yeah. One for bad, two for good.

1751
02:09:03,444 --> 02:09:06,362
- Bet two for good. - Yeah.

1752
02:09:17,124 --> 02:09:20,209
'Course, three minutes to Wapner.

1753
02:09:20,377 --> 02:09:22,044
You'll make it.

1754
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:25,381
Yeah.
