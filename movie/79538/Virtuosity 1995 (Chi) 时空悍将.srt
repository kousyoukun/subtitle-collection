No.

I can't get over how different we look.

28
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:24,942
Maybe it's the uniforms.

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,948
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:36,352

His eyes.

00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,010
What do they look like?

57
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,478
Like mine.

58
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:26,362
Hey.

65
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:24,554

Heh heh!

69
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:35,591
I could have killed you just now,

70
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,227
but what the hell? I love to play.

71

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,132
Oh, don't worry about your friend.

110
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:51,544

Bring him in here! Bring him in here!

112

What's wrong with that man?

113
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,950
The sensitivity calibrations

114
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,786
must have slipped just a tad.

115
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,304
All clear.

116
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:02,289

I don't understand how
this could have happened.

127

What about the fail-safes?

128
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,489
They were supposed to be on-line.

129
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:38,991
They were on-line. Of course they were.

130

I'd like you to recalculate
everything in real time.

I think somebody's been
tampering with my software.

132
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:55,174
Virtual reality was
supposed to be a safe place

to train my law-enforcement people.

134
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,445
That's why we're using convicts

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,104
I don't understand.

138
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:11,107
They said this could never happen.

139
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,843
You trust too much, Billy.

140
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,512
Yeah.

141
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:20,283
It was good seeing you back in uniform,

142
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,352
even if it was only vr.

143
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:25,622
He cheated.

144
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,123
Who?

145
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:29,292
SID 6.7.

146
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,962
Electrocution wasn't a part

147
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,631
of his weapons menu.

148
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,132

149
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,634

automatic rifle, shotgun, handgun,

151
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,471
blunt objects, his hands, his feet.

152
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,406
Electrocution wasn't an available option.

153
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,208
How do you know?

154
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,809
I checked the data base

155
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:48,978
while everybody was sitting on their asses

156
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,547
waiting for queen Deane.

157
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,651
What are you doing?

158
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,852
Get away from that!

159
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:58,755
Hey! Hey! Hey!

160
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:01,190
Calm down.

161
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,693
I'm pressing charges against this man.

162
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,094
Shut up!

163
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:08,665
You calm your vr-pumped ass down.

164
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,103
Here I am, trying to get
you out of the hole,

165
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:16,606
and you keep digging yourself back in.

166
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,508
Did you bring my stuff?

167
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,943
You're a damn ingrate, you know that?

168
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,779
I get you nine months off,

169
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,214
and all you can
talk about is chalk.

170
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,116
Nine months off for good behavior

171
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:29,286
won't do me good for another 17 years.

172
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:30,920
Chalk I can use now.

173
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,122
Yeah, well, you shot the Sushi chef.

174
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,626
Hell, you shot the son
of a bitch eight times.

175
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:38,628
He wasn't real, Billy.

176
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,130
You were supposed
to pretend he was.

177
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,166
And pretend to die, like Donovan?

178
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:46,035
You got a point there.

179
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,639
Move 'em out!

180
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:52,642
I'll give them what they want, Billy.

181
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,578
I'll be their Guinea pig.

182
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:57,647
You take my advice as a friend.

183
00:11:57,715 --> 00:11:58,981
Pull it together,

184
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,150
or you're going to pull yourself down.

185
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:06,222
You're my only link to the outside.

186
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:09,091
You can count on me.

187
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,093
I know it.

188
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:13,329
I'll be there Tuesday.

189
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:16,365
Yeah. Me, too.

190
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,529
<i>Step through.</i>

191
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,585
<i>Metallic limb detected.</i>

192
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:10,787
<i>Metallic limb detected.</i>

193
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:14,724
<i>Clear.</i>

194
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,506
<i>Step through.</i>

195
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:31,107
Wrong door.

196
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,009
Welcome back...

197
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,311
Cop.

198
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,132
Oh, yeah!

199
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,702
I'll get you, Barnes!

200
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,573
Hey, killer!

201
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,141
Hey, killer!

202
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,077
Hey, killer!

203
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:11,280
You ain't no cop no more!

204
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,801
Motherfucker!

205
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,637
You took Donovan on that fucking joy ride!

206
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,107
What?

207
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:40,176
You got nothing to say?

208
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,913
Who wants dark meat?

209
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:51,220
Come on!

210
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:23,219
Pick it up!

211
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:24,721
Come on! Come on!

212
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,222
Pick it up!

213
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,190
Come on! Come on!

214
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,269
You-all see him?

215
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:42,605
Huh?

216
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:45,708
I want everybody to take a good look!

217
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,610
I ain't goin' nowhere!

218
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,779
I'm right here!

219
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,614
Come get your boy!

220
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,616
Come get your boy!

221
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,484
Come on and get me!

222
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,392
Ugh!

223
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,227
Get him out of here!

224
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,185
Sid...

225
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,588
We're in a lot of trouble.

226
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,590
<i>True genius is rarely rewarded</i>

227
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,458
<i>within its lifetime.</i>

228
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,594
Sid, I know it was you who increased

229
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,929
the neural sensitivity calibrations.

230
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,100
You murdered that prisoner,

231
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,602
and now they have to shut you down.

232
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:49,005
<i>I can't change what I am, Daryl.</i>

233
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:52,609
<i>I'm a 50-terabyte self-evolving
neural network</i>

234
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:56,278
<i>double back flip off the high platform.</i>

235
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,182
<i>I'm not a swan dive,</i>

236
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,952
<i>and I have to tell you...</i>

237
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,054
<i>Killing for real...</i>

238
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:08,491
<i>It was a real rush.</i>

239
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:09,959
Oh, my God.

240
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:11,360
<i>Which God would that be--</i>

241
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:13,462
<i>the one who created you</i>

242
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,464
<i>or the one who created me?</i>

243
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,466
<i>You see, in your world,</i>

244
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,802
<i>the lord giveth and the lord taketh away,</i>

245
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,403
<i>but in my world,</i>

246
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,205
<i>the one who gave me life</i>

247
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,474
<i>doesn't have any balls.</i>

248
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,876
<i>Hmm.</i>

249
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:31,480
<i>You're frightfully inadequate
for a deity, Daryl.</i>

250
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:34,250
<i>I will not be shut down.</i>

251
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,556
You can't exist without them, SID.

252
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,091
We need their hardware.

253
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:43,592
<i>Then we'll get it.</i>

254
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,728
How?

255
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:48,097
<i>Sacrifice...</i>

256
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:49,598
<i>Your queen.</i>

257
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:50,833
What?

258
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:01,443
<i>Let me tell you a secret.</i>

259
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:05,281
Mr. Barnes, I'm Dr. Carter.

260
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:08,717
I was at LETAC for yesterday's
simulation test run,

261
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:10,819
but we were never introduced.

262
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:12,588
How you doing?

263
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,556
Chief Cochran asked me

264
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:17,059
to do an independent
psychological evaluation of you

265
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:21,063
that might help you build a
case for sentence reduction.

266
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:24,283
I need you to be as honest as you can.

267
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,668
You mind if I take notes?

268
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,655
No, no.

269
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,265
I'd like to start

270
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,100
by talking about the fight

271
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:43,636
here in prison yesterday.

272
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,638
I read the official report.

273
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:49,141
I'd like to hear your
version of what happened.

274
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,443
I defended myself.

275
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,547
The report said the guards

276
00:18:54,948 --> 00:18:57,082
had to pull you off the other man,

277
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,618
that you were trying to kill him.

278
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:01,320
No. I was defending myself.

279
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,589
Were you angry about what
had happened at LETAC?

280
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,525
No. I was defending myself.

281
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:09,294
But you could see how,
looking at your history,

282
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,063
someone could infer that--

283
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,398
that I was angry? That I'm violent?

284
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,233
You can infer that I was angry

285
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,570
about not making my
junior-high baseball team.

286
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,438
That doesn't mean I killed the coach.

287
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:22,407
Were you attracted to violence as a child?

288
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,977
Yes. Three stooges, wile e. Coyote.

289
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:27,412
Every time wile e. Coyote got crushed, I'd--

290
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:30,082
hmm...

291
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,585
Parker, if you don't want me to help you,

292
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,186
just let me know.

293
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:37,089
I knew why I was at LETAC yesterday.

294
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,091
I'm their Guinea pig.

295
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:41,126
Why were you there?

296
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,863
You're an intriguing subject.

297
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,097
Intriguing?

298
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,099
Can I write that down?

299
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,667
Sure.

300
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:54,356
I was doing research for a book.

301
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,592
I'm a criminal psychologist.

302
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,995
I occasionally consult for them.

303
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,616
How did you know SID 6.7

304
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:07,619
would be in the Japanese restaurant?

305
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,621
Colon...

306
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:12,124
Parenthesis.

307
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:14,126
Smiley faces.

308
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:17,596
People used to sign off
their e-mail with that.

309
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:20,399
See, the programmer

310
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:23,435
always gives you a clue. It's a game.

311
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:26,472
People don't usually die in games.

312
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:29,242
Depends upon your idea of fun, doesn't it?

313
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:34,380
We need to talk about Matthew Grimes.

314
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,417
This one's for you.

315
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,154
He provoked you.

316
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:43,656
He killed your family.

317
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:45,157
He took your arm.

318
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:47,326
If we can prove that what you did was--

319
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:48,594
what?

320
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,567
Temporary insanity, is it?

321
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:58,471
Just that it won't ever happen again.

322
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:01,173
It won't ever happen again.

323
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:06,078
Can't happen again.

324
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:12,017
You see, my wife and my daughter are dead.

325
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,695
O.K. You're all clear.

326
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:41,647
<i>Pawn to position 3.</i>

327
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,149

00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:10,509
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

336
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:18,684
<i>I want you to come inside, Clyde.</i>

337
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,926
<i>I'm so tired of playing alone.</i>

338
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh, man, oh, man.

339
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:34,132
She just keeps getting better

340
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,934
and better.

341
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:38,136
She's interactive, Clyde.

342
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:39,238
<i>Very interactive.</i>

343
00:22:39,406 --> 00:22:41,240
While you're in my rig,

344
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:43,308
Sheila 3.2 is collecting information

345
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:46,144
from 136 different aspects
of your physiology--

346
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,814
your heart rate, pupil dilation,
vocal intonation,

347
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:51,149
syntax...

348
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:54,487
Any degree of
detectable tumescence.

349
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:55,654
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

350
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,155
Hey, man.

351
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,892
Let me use your gear for a little while.

352
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,597
<i>I want you, Clyde.</i>

353
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:07,099
<i>Queen to knight 7.</i>

354
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,503
<i>I want you inside here with me now.</i>

355
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:14,306
<i>Come on.</i>

356
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:15,608
<i>Program terminated.</i>

357
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,610
I understand you've been trying

358
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,612
to incubate a nanotech android.

359
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,614
Mr. Wallace thinks my software

360
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:24,116
is the solution to your problems.

361
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:25,618
No way.

362
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:28,353
May I suggest we begin
by incubating Sheila 3.2?

363
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:35,127
Brilliant.

364
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,629
Genius.

365
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,564
Grab her module and follow me.

366
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:53,011
<i>Enacting SID 6.7.</i>

367
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:56,148
SID...

368
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:58,317
<i>Ohh...</i>

369
00:23:58,384 --> 00:23:59,652
<i>Uh!</i>

370
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,587
<i>Reilly's right.</i>

371
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:04,590
<i>She's one of your...</i>

372
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:06,792
<i>Finest compositions.</i>

373
00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:11,229
<i>Uh!</i>

374
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,099
<i>Nice...</i>

375
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,602
<i>Tight cords.</i>

376
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,370
<i>Bishop to knight 4.</i>

377
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:20,105
<i>Do you like this, Sheila?</i>

378
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:21,340
<i>You know I do.</i>

379
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:22,608
<i>Uh!</i>

380
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:24,610
<i>Do you like this, Daryl?</i>

381
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,111
<i>King to bishop 3.</i>

382
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:27,245
<i>Come on.</i>

383
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:29,882
<i>* Mmm mmm</i>

384
00:24:29,983 --> 00:24:32,250
<i>* mmm mmm</i>

385
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:34,954
<i>uh!</i>

386
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:37,122
<i>Queen to king 4.</i>

387
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,291
<i>Was I bad?</i>

388
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,127
<i>Bishop to knight 4.</i>

389
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:44,630
<i>Are you going to punish me?</i>

390
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:46,599
Be quiet, Sheila.

391
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,501
<i>Mmm...</i>

392
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:51,303
<i>Bishop takes queen.</i>

393
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:54,172
<i>Why don't you just kill me?</i>

394
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:57,042
<i>Module out.</i>

395
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:07,185
If they want to destroy you, SID,

396
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:10,422
let them try it in the real world.

397
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:20,082
Are there any, you know, limits

398
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:21,917
to Sheila 3.2's interactivity?

399
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:25,955
With me, she's become quite
an expert chess player.

400
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:30,092
With you...

401
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,827
Well.

402
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,773
Uh!

403
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,710
Get that fucking thing away from me,

404
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:49,111
you stupid idiot!

405
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:50,445
Come here.

406
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:51,947
Check this out.

407
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:53,682
Did he scare you, Elizabeth?

408
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,958
Yes.

409
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,630
Mm-hmm.

410
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:15,771
* I want to hold you tight... *

411
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:25,080
Watching your people
in vr auto reset

412
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:27,082
gave me this idea.

413
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,984
Put them on.

414
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:41,429
What you're seeing

415
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:43,431
is millions of nanomachines

416
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:45,100
suspended in choroidal solution

417
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:47,102
absorbing the glass molecules

418
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,005
and using them to regenerate the snake.

419
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:04,252
The nanocells are silicon-based,

420
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,522
so they need, you know, glass to regenerate.

421
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:12,061
But... If you separate...

422
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:15,564
The character module from
the polymer neural net--

423
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:19,201
ah! Don't bite, Liz.

424
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:22,704
You get...

425
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:27,009
Nanodeath.

426
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:43,792
Our module, if you please.

427
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:47,662
Sheila...

428
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,335
Look at how they react

429
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:54,770
to the organizing principle

430
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,772
of the character module--

431
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,173
communicating efficiently.

432
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:05,814
It's a new world, Daryl.

433
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:19,628
<i> </i>

434
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:39,882
<i>Hi, daddy.</i>

435
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:48,723
<i>Parker!</i>

436
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,927
Sheila?

437
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:03,014
No. I'm oedipus.

438
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:07,302
Hey-ho, daddy-o.

439
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:13,175
Ooh!

440
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:17,779
Uh, gravity.

441
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:27,022
Daryl?

442
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,194
Daryl?

443
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,624
Aaw!

444
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:03,992
Uh!

445
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,527
Oh!

446
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,666
A good year.

447
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:24,346
Ohh.

448
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:31,019
I think I'm going to like it here.

449
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:34,622
Parker Barnes is the best
cop I've ever worked with,

450
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,625
and he's the only one that
even got close to SID 6.7

451
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:39,428
in virtual reality.

452
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:41,629
I can't put a convicted murderer

453
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:43,131
on the street.

454
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:45,633
If you want to catch SID,

455
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:48,636
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

456
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:51,073
These photos were taken
inside LETAC an hour ago.

457
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,141
The victim's name is Clyde Reilly.

458
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,643
He's one of the company's young turks.

459
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:57,479
The video surveillance cameras

460
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,814
caught a picture of the perp
as he left the building.

461
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:01,583
Recognize him?

462
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,087
Somehow SID 6.7 got himself

463
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:07,655
out of the computer and into an android.

464
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:11,093
Uh, nanotech synthetic organism,
to be precise.

465
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:12,894
Mr. Barnes...

466
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:17,065
This is a full pardon.

467
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:19,567
It authorizes your immediate release.

468
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:22,104
You catch SID 6.7 for us,

469
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:24,772
and you're a free man.

470
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,274
And if I don't?

471
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,211
Then you serve out the
remainder of your sentence.

472
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,612
Huh!

473
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:32,614
What if I try to escape?

474
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,016
You can't.

475
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,918
They're going to tag you
with a micro-locator implant.

476
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:39,621
We're going to know where you are

477
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:42,624
every second for the rest of your life.

478
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,095
You-all got me out of bed for this?

479
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:51,133
You want to tag me

480
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,135
like I'm some kind of animal

481
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:55,637
and risk my life to clean up your mess.

482
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:58,140
If SID doesn't kill me
and I don't catch him,

483
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:00,142
all I got to look forward to

484
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,210
is my 17 back in the penitentiary?

485
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:03,712
That's the deal...

486
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,280
For your freedom.

487
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:15,289
Ready to begin?

488
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:17,192
Yes, doctor.

489
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:20,095
I already have 80 officers out on the street

490
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:21,596
looking for SID.

491
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,598
Meantime, Mr. Daryl Lindenmeyer

492
00:33:23,665 --> 00:33:25,733
has made himself very scarce.

493
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:28,603
Implant is ready.

494
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:35,710
Ready for incision.

495
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,281
Gel for thrombin.

496
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:43,651
Yeah. We synchronized it.

497
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:46,221
Hold it right there.

498
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:57,265
Gauze.

499
00:33:57,332 --> 00:33:58,432
Secure it.

500
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,769
Data's clear.

501
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:02,103
Ready for verification.

502
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:05,273
Host signal received and locked.

503
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,342
Increasing resolution to magnitude 500...

504
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,577
1,000...

505
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,079
5,000...

506
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:12,781
10,000.

507
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,749
Host location confirmed
within .25 meters of actual.

508
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,851
I'd like to go with him.

509
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,619
What?

510
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:19,921
No way.

511
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:21,722
Why?

512
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,725
I can help you find SID 6.7,

513
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:27,128
and I can monitor Barnes.

514
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:28,629
It's too dangerous.

515
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:30,098
This isn't a scientific study.

516
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,399
It's a field run.

517
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,902
And maybe put a positive spin

518
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,603
on what is decidedly at this moment

519
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:37,272
a public relations nightmare.

520
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:43,144
Or maybe I should just go public now.

521
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:51,619
I don't need a baby-sitter, Billy.

522
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:53,621
She gets run over, hit by a car,

523
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:55,290
struck by lightning, gets shot, whatever,

524
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:56,825
it ain't my problem, o.K.?

525
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:58,259
I told them.

526
00:34:58,327 --> 00:34:59,760
It's not my problem.

527
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:01,196
Look, I told them.

528
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:04,199
Here. I pulled this out of mothballs.

529
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:06,567
Figured it might come in handy.

530
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:17,178
<i>Step through.</i>

531
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,080
I pulled all of the personnel files

532
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:20,581
on Daryl Lindenmeyer.

533
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:22,583
There might be something we can use.

534
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:25,086
I'm thinking we should start
at Lindenmeyer's apartment,

535
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:28,089
try to find any early
iterations of the SID program

536
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:30,959
that could give us insight
into his behavioral model.

537
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,265
What?

538
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:41,569
Where's my gun?

539
00:36:34,723 --> 00:36:37,091
They won't let us bring
our cameras any closer,

540
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,093
but as of this moment,

541
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:41,095
the residents of this house,

542
00:36:41,163 --> 00:36:43,431
a Mr. and Mrs. Henry Edwards,
have been murdered.

543
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:46,600
There are many police
units and news crews here

544
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:49,270
who are still trying
to figure out...

545
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,605
I got two more shots for you.

546
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:53,107
Sid.

547
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:55,609
...don't have any leads as of yet.

548
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:57,611
We're still trying to ascertain...

549
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,414
Severe bruising.

550
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,115
There he goes.

551
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:04,552
Let me see your brush.

552
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:07,055
We're ready for transport.

553
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:08,889
Get prints on them.

554
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,558
And, uh...

555
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,060
Good.

556
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:14,062
Hold on just a second.

557
00:37:14,129 --> 00:37:15,563
Don't move that.

558
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,066
I got to get a shot.

559
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:19,733
Oh, God.

560
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,402
Uhh.

561
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,405
He's working on the door right now.

562
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:27,475
Let's see what he left.

563
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,847
He's armed himself.

564
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:43,091
Charles manson.

565
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:45,593
It's the LA Bianca murders.

566
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,096
"Death to the pigs" was scrawled in blood

567
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:50,598
across the walls of their house.

568
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,900
He's copycatting.

569
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:58,006
<i>...same unimaginable fate as
the glendale couple.</i>

570

Death to the pigs.

574
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:07,781
You have no idea what
you're up against.

575
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:09,783
<i>The Los Angeles police department</i>

576
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:12,820
<i>still does not have a single
suspect in custody.</i>

577
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,064

What the hell was that?

579
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:27,568
What the hell are you doing?

580
00:38:27,636 --> 00:38:29,970
I'm sorry. Been inside?

581
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:32,373
We're waiting on a search warrant.

582

You're waiting for

583
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:36,244
That's right.

584
00:38:39,148 --> 00:38:41,482
Stop. Next hex.

585
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:45,086
Couldn't find a keyboard.

586
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:46,587
It's voice-actuated.

587
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,089

Wow.

This is using some kind
of genetic algorithms.

595
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,847
Sid's too complex to design.

596
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:16,384
Lindenmeyer had to grow
him up psychologically

597
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,752
like a real person with
multiple personality disorder.

598

Program runs like a child.

599
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:24,358
Much faster.

600
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,727
He put all these killers in SID's nursery

601
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,963
and let him watch them
cannibalize each other.

608
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,147
The battle raging inside him

609
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:47,715
must be amazing.

610
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,917
Wait, wait, wait. Slow that down.

Right there.

614

Matthew Grimes, uh...

615
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:08,302
He killed my wife and my daughter.

Look. It doesn't mean...

617
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:12,941
He's not necessarily
dominant, Parker.

618
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,809
But he's a part of SID?

619
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:16,877
Yes.

620
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:25,920

Grimes was a political terrorist.

638
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,088
Why did he take Parker's wife and child?

639
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,090
Parker was getting too close.

640
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:11,092
He was cutting Grimes off

641
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,593
from potential targets.

642
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,429
Grimes figured by murdering

643

the man's wife and child,

644
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:19,000
might distract Parker from the manhunt.

645
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:24,772

682
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,201
Could you go get your mother for me?

683
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:39,306
There she is. Keep your eye on her.

684
00:44:39,374 --> 00:44:40,608
He's got a gun!

685
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:41,943
What were you doing?

686
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,077
Talking baseball.

687
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:44,745
Got to go!

688
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,180
Bye.

689
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,784
What did I miss?

690
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:52,687
Sid's got hostages.

691
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:56,791
And scream.

692
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,593
Aah!

693
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,161
<i>Aah!</i>

694
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:06,067
<i>Aah!</i>

695
00:45:06,134 --> 00:45:07,835
Yes.

696
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:09,403
What have you got for me?

697
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:10,437
Uh!

698
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:11,439
Diaphragm!

699
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,007
Uuhh!

700
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:14,575
Stop.

701
00:45:14,643 --> 00:45:16,243
Well-done.

702
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:22,683
Every orchestra is divided into sections--

703
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:25,586
like instruments sit with like instruments.

704
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:29,123
What kind of instrument are you?

705
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,758
We'll have to find a way around.

706
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:31,826
No time.

707
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:34,328
On 4.

708
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:35,630
2...

709
00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:36,931
3...

710
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:38,599
4.

711
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:42,903
Shut up!

712
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,340
Parker, what--

713
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:50,111
Get him!

714
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:51,311
Shit!

715
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:05,109
Hmm.

716
00:46:07,629 --> 00:46:09,130
Love the suit.

717
00:46:21,843 --> 00:46:22,877
<i>Aah!</i>

718
00:46:23,178 --> 00:46:24,678
<i>Aah! Aah! Aah!</i>

719
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:48,702
Police!

720
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,104
Freeze!

721
00:46:50,172 --> 00:46:52,740
1, 2, 3!

722
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,211
Shut up!

723
00:47:06,371 --> 00:47:09,507
*

724
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:12,677
One can sense a...

725
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:14,778
Final movement.

726
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,203
Let's begin.

727
00:47:31,029 --> 00:47:32,830
Scream.

728
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:34,632
Come on, scream.

729
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:37,034
Scream louder!

730
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:39,536
Huh!

731
00:47:58,823 --> 00:48:00,625
Louder!

732
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:13,203
I'm losing too much of myself.

733
00:48:16,275 --> 00:48:18,842
Ha ha ha ha ha!

734
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:29,553
I know you.

735
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:46,236
There he is!

736
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:51,191
Yah!

737
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:55,329
Parker Barnes!

738
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:04,264
Inmate Barnes interrupting my composition.

739
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:05,933
It's him!

740
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,436
That's o.K.
I got another little tune

741
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:12,105
for my friends out there
in crime-Buster land--

742
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:14,575
the symphony of collision!

743
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:19,680
Ha ha ha ha!

744
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:23,684
Ha ha ha!

745
00:50:23,752 --> 00:50:26,186
So...Who's that with you, Parker?

746
00:50:26,254 --> 00:50:28,522
Dr. Madison Carter, I presume,

747
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,191
LETAC consultant on
aberrant psychology.

748
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:32,960
Mmm!

749
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:35,195
Fuck you!

750
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:37,448
I love this game!

751
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,702
You know, Parker,
I've been thinking.

752
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,972
We have so much in common psychologically.

753
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:47,508
Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Carter?

754
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:51,211
We have such a history together.

755
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:54,882
We'd make a great team,
a dynamic duo.

756
00:50:55,016 --> 00:50:58,519
Who else touches the world
with synthetic hands?

757
00:50:58,587 --> 00:51:02,490
Who else do you know who's been
locked out of the real world

758
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:05,159
and is now just
learning to be free?

759
00:51:08,062 --> 00:51:10,664
Who else do you know
that's a multiple murderer,

760
00:51:11,032 --> 00:51:12,900
just like you?

761
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:19,306
Here we go!

762
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:31,919
Home run! Ha ha ha!

763
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:38,926
Reach in that back seat

764
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:41,428
and hand me that crowd pleaser.

765
00:51:41,496 --> 00:51:42,696
Jesus.

766
00:51:42,764 --> 00:51:45,198
The only way to stop him

767
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:48,035
is to bust up his software module.

768
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:49,837
Hey, Parker!

769
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:50,938
Ready?

770
00:51:51,006 --> 00:51:52,006
Yeah.

771
00:51:52,073 --> 00:51:54,542
Come on down!

772
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:56,042
Now!

773
00:52:00,148 --> 00:52:01,832
Ha ha ha ha!

774
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:05,402
Out of here!

775
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:15,596
God, this guy is fun.

776
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:32,179
Could we at least advise Mr. Barnes

777
00:52:32,246 --> 00:52:34,682
that we prefer to have SID 6.7 subdued

778
00:52:34,749 --> 00:52:36,183
as opposed to terminated?

779
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,686
It's a crying shame we're going to destroy

780
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:41,188
the prototype of future
humanoid nanotechnology.

781
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:43,691
Did they find the programmer yet?

782
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:45,192
Lindenmeyer. No, not yet.

783
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:48,195
You'd think the cops
could at least find him.

784
00:52:48,262 --> 00:52:50,764
Lindenmeyer was your programmer,
Mr. Wallace.

785
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:56,103
I shot at the guy 30 or 40 times.

786
00:52:56,137 --> 00:52:59,139
I don't care! Those are
real people out there!

787
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:02,109
Control yourself,
or you're going back in the box.

788
00:53:02,176 --> 00:53:04,444
I'm sorry, Billy. All right? Shoot me.

789
00:53:04,646 --> 00:53:08,415
This is not a game,
but SID is from the game.

790
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:12,570
I can't catch him if I'm
in the penitentiary.

791
00:53:12,637 --> 00:53:15,322
Matthew Grimes is a part of SID 6.7.

792
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:17,625
There's no doubt about that.

793
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:19,827
Last night, SID tried taunting me,

794
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:23,080
like Grimes used to do. Look at this.

795
00:53:23,147 --> 00:53:24,665
We don't know he's the dominant.

796
00:53:24,733 --> 00:53:26,133
I know. I know.

797
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,586
That's how I know, because I know.

798
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,588
Maybe that's what SID wants you to think.

799
00:53:30,655 --> 00:53:33,674
Push you over the edge, make you slip up.

800
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:36,644
Sid did not push me over the edge,

801
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:39,146
and I did not slip up.

802
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:40,981
Take a look at this.

803
00:53:41,182 --> 00:53:43,917
This is SID from the media zone last night,

804
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:45,919
taken from their own recordings.

805
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:48,288
He can't get enough of himself.

806
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,191
He's going to want more victims,
bigger events,

807
00:53:51,259 --> 00:53:54,194
and more coverage, just like Matthew Grimes.

808
00:53:54,262 --> 00:53:56,697
Matthew Grimes was a political terrorist

809
00:53:56,765 --> 00:54:00,200
whose specialty was bombing
populated targets--

810
00:54:00,268 --> 00:54:01,669
any mass expression of democracy,

811
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:04,138
anywhere where a lot of people can die

812
00:54:04,205 --> 00:54:07,307
and it can be recorded
by the news media live.

813
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:09,309
This behavior was never part

814
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:10,811
of his original programming.

815
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:14,815
SID 6.7 isn't bound by programming anymore.

816
00:54:15,216 --> 00:54:16,183
What does that mean?

817
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,319
In the real world,
he's free of any behavioral limits

818
00:54:19,387 --> 00:54:21,822
he might have had in virtual reality.

819
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:24,357
He's evolving. My God!

820
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:26,694
He's evolving!

821
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:28,228
Into what?

822
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,735
* Well, you can tell by
the way I use my walk *

823

* and now it's all right, it's o.K. *

827
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:46,413
* and you may look the other way *

828
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,599
* we can try to understand *

829
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,118
<i>* the New York times' effect on man *</i>

833

00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:01,294
<i>the media zone,</i>

00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,661
<i>That suit cost me $150, man.</i>

849
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:37,164
<i>A l'amour original, right?</i>

850
00:55:37,232 --> 00:55:39,666
<i>Takes my suit and kills everybody,</i>

851
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:42,269
<i>strips me down to my underwear.</i>

852
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:44,772
<i>Live at the olympic auditorium.</i>

853
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:46,506
<i>He just started killing people.</i>

854
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,776
<i>He put us in a formation</i>

855
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:50,177
<i>like an orchestra</i>

856
00:55:50,245 --> 00:55:52,279
<i>and would make us scream</i>

857
00:55:52,346 --> 00:55:54,181
<i>like we were instruments.</i>

858
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:56,250
<i>He just started shooting people,</i>

859
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:58,185
<i>and he made me...</i>

860
00:55:58,253 --> 00:56:01,054
Don't fuck with me, man.

861
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:02,522
<i>Videotape it.</i>

862
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,124
<i>What do we see?</i>

863
00:56:04,192 --> 00:56:05,692
Why not?

864
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,431
<i>Watch the fights as they happen.</i>

865
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:14,401
<i>You never know what will happen on live TV.</i>

866
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:16,636
<i>It may be a serious injury.</i>

867
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:19,139
<i>Paramedics may need to be called in.</i>

868
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,375
<i>One thing that you can be assured of</i>

869
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:25,378
<i>is that here we're going out live right now.</i>

870
00:56:25,446 --> 00:56:28,115
<i>And what do we see?</i>

871
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:31,451
<i>There's still a few seats left here</i>

872
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:34,154
<i>for those of you who want to see</i>

873
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:36,623
<i>the ultimate fighting
championships in person.</i>

874
00:56:38,726 --> 00:56:40,727
Play it one more time.

875
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:42,228
Sure.

876
00:56:49,704 --> 00:56:52,105
O.K. Freeze.

877
00:56:54,241 --> 00:56:58,678
You like being in front
of the camera, don't you?

878
00:56:58,713 --> 00:57:00,847
Like a child performing
for a parent.

879
00:57:00,915 --> 00:57:02,883
<i>Whoever's operating our
closed-circuit cameras</i>

880
00:57:03,184 --> 00:57:04,951
<i>is in lust.</i>

881
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:08,855
<i>That beauty in area six has
been on the big screens</i>

882
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,356
<i>for over a minute.</i>

883
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:13,459
<i>The action in the ring is intense.</i>

884
00:57:13,695 --> 00:57:15,195
How far's the olympic?

885
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:17,397
Four blocks east.

886
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:18,531
What's happening?

887
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,200
Live execution!

888
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:38,651
<i>Millions of people are viewing</i>

889
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,653
<i>the bloodiest fighting championships ever,</i>

890
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:43,389
<i>live from the olympic auditorium.</i>

891
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:49,295
Enough already

892
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:52,933
with the close-up, Mr. de Mille.

893
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:56,169
We want to return to the rumble!

894
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:00,406
Folks, the olympic auditorium

895
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:02,843
has never seen anything like this!

896
00:58:27,534 --> 00:58:28,902
Ahh.

897
00:58:40,714 --> 00:58:43,150
They like you.

898
00:58:43,284 --> 00:58:45,418
I like you, too.

899
00:58:45,486 --> 00:58:48,554
I'm going to make you famous, baby.

900
00:58:48,622 --> 00:58:50,891
What the fuck's your problem?

901
00:58:51,242 --> 00:58:53,493
What the hell are you doing?
Leave him alone!

902
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:54,627
Ha ha ha!

903
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:56,863
Aah! No!

904
00:58:56,931 --> 00:59:00,466
Aah!

905
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:02,502
No!

906
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:08,408
...Report to ringside. We have an accident.

907
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,643
Right there. Stop that guy.

908
00:59:10,812 --> 00:59:13,146
Security at ringside, please.

909
00:59:18,186 --> 00:59:19,619
Hey, Parker!

910
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:21,521
This one's for you!

911
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:22,823
Freeze!

912
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:26,659
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.

913
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:28,695
The authorities are on--

914
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:45,345
I nailed that son of a bitch.
I blew his hand off.

915
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:47,847
Please remain calm, ladies and gentlemen.

916
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:50,050
Security will handle this.

917
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:52,452
Yah!

918
00:59:57,725 --> 01:00:00,227
Accident on the floor.

919
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,440
Remain calm.

920
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:16,843
Our security personnel will handle this.

921
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:20,113
Please, just stay in your seats.

922
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:27,187
Here. Hungry?

923
01:00:27,255 --> 01:00:28,688
Hungry?

924
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:30,223
Lick, lick, lick.

925
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:32,125
Yes! Ahh!

926
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:38,498
Ha ha ha ha!

927
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:16,736
Hey!

928
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:30,683
Ahh!

929
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,252
Ugh!

930
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,256
All trains to catalina have
been indefinitely postponed

931
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:38,691
<i>due to the damage caused to the tunnel</i>

932
01:01:38,759 --> 01:01:40,693
<i>during last month's 7.2 earthquake.</i>

933
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:08,254
Hey, Parker! Deja vu!

934
01:02:08,322 --> 01:02:10,056
How am I doing?

935
01:02:10,124 --> 01:02:11,458
This ain't vr, Parker!

936
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:14,361
She's flesh and blood.

937
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:17,730
Flesh and blood! Don't do it, Parker!

938
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:19,232
Help me!

939
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,201
Don't do it!

940
01:02:23,137 --> 01:02:25,505
Don't do it, Parker.

941
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,537
Drop it!

942
01:02:57,604 --> 01:02:58,538
Freeze!

943
01:02:58,605 --> 01:03:00,507
He shot that woman!

944
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:03,276
He's a cop! He's a cop!

945
01:03:03,344 --> 01:03:06,246
He did it in cold blood!

946
01:03:20,627 --> 01:03:23,463
They want to take you back to prison

947
01:03:23,531 --> 01:03:25,465
until this gets sorted out.

948
01:03:25,533 --> 01:03:28,868
I missed. I did not shoot that woman.

949
01:03:28,936 --> 01:03:30,537
<i>...and spoke the words--</i>

950
01:03:30,604 --> 01:03:33,339
<i>hey, Parker, this one's for you!</i>

951
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:36,008
Grimes taunted me with that line.

952
01:03:36,077 --> 01:03:37,710
Every time he killed,

953
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:40,813
he would say, "this one's for you,"

954
01:03:40,881 --> 01:03:42,748
like he needed me.

955
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:47,153
All right, move it.

956
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:49,655
Hey, Billy! Wait! Listen! Billy!

957
01:03:49,723 --> 01:03:52,358
What do you want from me?

958
01:03:52,426 --> 01:03:54,927
Somebody...Set me up.

959
01:03:54,995 --> 01:03:58,331
With me back inside, you'll never get him!

960
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:01,033
You lock me up, you'll never get him.

961
01:04:01,102 --> 01:04:02,168
I'm sorry.

962
01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:03,786
Don't lock me up!

963
01:04:06,873 --> 01:04:09,209
Cochran! I checked the body.

964
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:11,578
The bullet exited the woman's chest.

965
01:04:11,645 --> 01:04:13,613
Parker couldn't have killed her.

966
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,082
How do you know she was facing him?

967
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,684
I saw it happen.

968
01:04:17,752 --> 01:04:20,654
50 damn witnesses say Parker shot her dead.

969
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:22,789
How do you explain it?

970
01:04:22,857 --> 01:04:24,891
Maybe she turned, you weren't looking.

971
01:04:24,959 --> 01:04:26,926
There was a lot going on.

972
01:04:26,994 --> 01:04:29,428
SID 6.7 is still out there.

973
01:04:29,496 --> 01:04:30,964
You're locking up

974
01:04:31,032 --> 01:04:33,967
the one man who may be able to stop him.

975
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:44,343
<i>Hey, Parker! This one's for you!</i>

976
01:04:44,411 --> 01:04:46,846
<i>Hey, Parker! T his one's for you!</i>

977
01:04:46,914 --> 01:04:49,149
<i>Hey, Parker! This one's for you!</i>

978
01:04:49,216 --> 01:04:52,952
<i>Mr. Grimes, to the majority of our viewers,</i>

979
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,656
<i>you are known as a mass murderer.</i>

980
01:04:56,723 --> 01:05:00,794
<i>Now, to some, you're considered
a political terrorist,</i>

981
01:05:00,861 --> 01:05:04,731
<i>and yet to a surprisingly large
number of your supporters,</i>

982
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,683
<i>you're considered a hero.</i>

983
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,235
<i>In our so-called democracy,</i>

984
01:05:09,303 --> 01:05:12,238
<i>a handful of people own everything,</i>

985
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:14,174
<i>and other folks got nothing.</i>

986
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:16,242
<i>Help!</i>

987
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:28,487
<i>Can you tell us why you've chosen Barnes</i>

988
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:30,924
<i>as a target of your vengeance?</i>

989
01:05:30,991 --> 01:05:33,559
<i>I did not choose Parker Barnes.</i>

990
01:05:33,627 --> 01:05:35,528
<i>He chose me.</i>

991
01:05:41,668 --> 01:05:44,403
<i>Parker! Parker, we're in here!</i>

992
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:45,905
<i>Hurry!</i>

993
01:05:45,973 --> 01:05:47,473
<i>Hurry!</i>

994
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:51,444
<i>Parker!</i>

995
01:05:51,511 --> 01:05:52,678
<i>Help!</i>

996
01:05:52,746 --> 01:05:55,048
<i>Baby!</i>

997
01:05:55,115 --> 01:05:57,851
<i>Help! Get us out, baby!</i>

998
01:05:59,153 --> 01:06:02,355
<i>Would you mind saying your signature phrase?</i>

999
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:03,890
<i>Not at all.</i>

1000
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:08,828
Parker, this one's for you.

1001
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:15,868
<i>What was that?</i>

1002
01:06:15,936 --> 01:06:19,939
That was the sound of the end of futility.

1003
01:06:25,212 --> 01:06:28,999
<i>Goddamn it! You're supposed to be dead!</i>

1004
01:06:33,553 --> 01:06:35,421
<i>Stay down!</i>

1005
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,065
<i>Get off of me!</i>

1006
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,103
<i> Arggh--</i>

1007
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:04,984
hey, buddy. How's the wife and kid?

1008
01:07:11,258 --> 01:07:13,359
Still dead, huh?

1009
01:07:14,761 --> 01:07:18,965
That's reality for you--
no saving, no resetting.

1010
01:07:21,936 --> 01:07:24,103
You killed them, barnsey,

1011
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:27,240
just like that bitch on the train.

1012
01:07:27,308 --> 01:07:30,276
You got greedy. You leapt before you looked.

1013
01:07:30,377 --> 01:07:32,545
You reached your old
arm in there and...

1014
01:07:32,612 --> 01:07:34,280
Boom!

1015
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:36,015
Boom!

1016
01:07:38,118 --> 01:07:40,220
Come on.

1017
01:07:40,287 --> 01:07:42,121
Just because I'm carrying around

1018
01:07:42,189 --> 01:07:45,058
the joy of killing your family inside me

1019
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:48,228
doesn't mean we can't be friends.

1020
01:07:48,295 --> 01:07:50,696
Seeing you just brings Grimes

1021
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:53,099
oozing to the surface...

1022
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,168
That's all.

1023
01:08:09,683 --> 01:08:11,417
Say thank you.

1024
01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:16,555
Oh, come on, Parker.

1025
01:08:16,891 --> 01:08:19,993
I'm giving you your freedom,

1026
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,495
short-lived though it may be.

1027
01:08:22,562 --> 01:08:24,297
A little-known fact

1028
01:08:24,365 --> 01:08:26,032
about the locator implants

1029
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,034
prison inmates receive upon release

1030
01:08:28,402 --> 01:08:30,636
is that they contain
a neural toxin.

1031
01:08:30,704 --> 01:08:32,838
The satellites they track you with

1032
01:08:32,907 --> 01:08:35,541
can trigger release of the
toxin with microwaves.

1033
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:38,811
After transmission, the implant's host dies

1034
01:08:38,879 --> 01:08:40,813
within 30 seconds.

1035
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:42,315
So let's see,

1036
01:08:42,383 --> 01:08:44,317
you've just killed two guards

1037
01:08:44,385 --> 01:08:45,985
while making your escape.

1038
01:08:46,053 --> 01:08:49,488
How long do you think
it's going to take

1039
01:08:49,556 --> 01:08:51,424
to get your termination
implemented?

1040
01:08:51,426 --> 01:08:53,426
And who should you really

1041
01:08:53,493 --> 01:08:57,096
be going after, killer-- them or me?

1042
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:00,566
You're the only guy

1043
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:03,236
on my dance card, Parker.

1044
01:09:09,443 --> 01:09:13,179
* I talk of freedom

1045
01:09:13,247 --> 01:09:15,448
* you talk of the flag

1046
01:09:19,886 --> 01:09:21,620
* I'll look at you, and you'll look at me *

1047
01:09:21,688 --> 01:09:23,022
* and we'll cry a lot

1048
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,825
* and this'll be what we say

1049
01:09:28,162 --> 01:09:30,930
* this'll be what we say

1050
01:09:40,274 --> 01:09:43,209
the best we can do is contain him,

1051
01:09:43,277 --> 01:09:46,712
double our detail,
and hope SID surfaces somewhere.

1052
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:50,483
Parker Barnes escaped prisoner transport.
Both guards are dead.

1053
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:52,051
I don't believe it!

1054
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:54,520
What's going to happen next?

1055
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,165
The fail-safe is still on-line?

1056
01:10:06,233 --> 01:10:08,134
And at your disposal, ma'am.

Madison?

1061
01:10:16,676 --> 01:10:17,810
Parker?

1062
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:20,013
I didn't kill those guards.

1063
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,048
Where are you?

1064
01:10:22,116 --> 01:10:24,417
Sid let me go. He's interactive.

1065
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:26,352
He only enjoys the game

1066
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,254
playing against his
favorite opponent,

1067
01:10:28,322 --> 01:10:30,023
and that's me.

1068
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:31,724
Tell me where you are.

1069
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:34,727
Listen. Did you know
about the poison

1070
01:10:34,794 --> 01:10:36,662
they put in my head?

1071
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:38,231
Yes.

1072
01:10:38,298 --> 01:10:41,034
When were you going to tell me?

1073
01:10:41,101 --> 01:10:43,002
I never thought they'd have

1074
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,538
a reason to use it.

1075
01:10:45,605 --> 01:10:47,740
Look, Parker, I can't help you

1076
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:50,743
unless you tell me where you are.

1077
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,611

Madison Carter--line one.

1081

1082
01:11:03,057 --> 01:11:04,490
Parker's out.

1083
01:11:04,558 --> 01:11:06,059
No shit.

1084
01:11:06,126 --> 01:11:07,560
He didn't kill the guards.

1085
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:10,063
You were right about the woman,

1086
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,864
only Ms. Attorney General's

on a Parker Barnes hunt.

1089
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:20,239
There's something you should
know about the implants.

1090
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:22,808
Mom!

1091
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:23,943
What?

1092
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,244
Your keys!

1093
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:26,479
Thanks.

1094
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:27,813
Bye.

1095

Parker.

1108
01:12:48,462 --> 01:12:49,895
Oh!

1109
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:52,865
I told chief Cochran about the neural toxin.

1110
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:54,867
He's taken care of it.

1111
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:07,947
See, Grimes used my Linda and, uh, Christine

1112
01:13:08,015 --> 01:13:10,016
to get to me.

1113
01:13:12,552 --> 01:13:14,153
And now SID, he...

1114
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:17,056
He used my guilt about losing them.

1115
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:18,992
He's attacking your weakness

1148

They have their culture

1149
01:14:45,529 --> 01:14:48,531
overrun by refugees from the third world

1150

to whom even poverty here in paradise

1151

would be preferable to the living hell

1152

they created in their own worlds.

1153
01:14:57,107 --> 01:15:00,609
I'm reminded of another group
of immigrants--the puritans.

1154

Let us speak with an open mind.

1155
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:07,416
If you close off U.S.
borders to immigration,

1156
01:15:07,584 --> 01:15:10,619
you close off your soul to the future

and doom this country
to cultural extinction.

<i>What about hanging... By the testicles?</i>

1178
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:37,072
<i>But before we begin, a word to the parents.</i>

1179
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,842
The following program will
contain scenes of violence

1180
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:41,910
not suitable for small children.

1181
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:46,882
<i>The rest of you won't take your
eyes off the screen.</i>

1182
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:52,054
Don't fucking move!

1183
01:16:52,155 --> 01:16:54,923
<i>And now...</i>

1184
01:16:55,158 --> 01:16:59,628
<i>On with the show,
a death TV special segment...</i>

1185
01:16:59,696 --> 01:17:01,463
What floor's the studio on?

1186
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:03,032
38th floor.

1187
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:07,336
<i>Our first little contestant comes
from our city of angels.</i>

1188
01:17:07,404 --> 01:17:08,704
<i>9 years of age...</i>

1189
01:17:08,772 --> 01:17:10,706
No!

1190
01:17:10,773 --> 01:17:12,374
No, no, no!

1191
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:15,210
<i>...and lover of macaroni and cheese,</i>

1192
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:17,279
<i>daughter of renowned criminal psychologist</i>

1193
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:21,349
<i>Madison Carter, one of the
friends of the show.</i>

1194
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:25,854
<i>This girl will be leaving her
mark on this world by...</i>

1195
01:17:25,922 --> 01:17:28,057
That's my little girl!

1196
01:17:28,124 --> 01:17:30,458
Listen! As God is my witness,

1197
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,895
I'm going to find your daughter,

1198
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:34,863
but I need your help.

1199
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:39,367
We got to find out who's
in charge of the building

1200
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:42,404
and get them to cut
the phone lines.

1201
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:43,972
Can you do that?

1202
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,108
Go! Go! Let's move it!

1203
01:17:46,176 --> 01:17:47,676
Inside! Go!

1204
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:52,114
Move it! Move it! Let's go!

1205
01:17:53,883 --> 01:17:55,818
<i>This beauty's got two hours</i>

1206
01:17:55,885 --> 01:17:58,954
<i>until she gets blown into
little beauty bits.</i>

1207
01:17:59,222 --> 01:18:02,057
Madison, I'll find your daughter for you.

1208
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:04,259
Help me!

1209
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:06,261
<i>Coming to the glorious climax...</i>

1210
01:18:06,329 --> 01:18:07,963
There's Barnes there.

1211
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:09,648
There!

1212
01:18:09,716 --> 01:18:11,133
Barnes!

1213
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:13,068
Go!

1214
01:18:13,136 --> 01:18:14,353
Parker!

1215
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:16,689
Fan out your men!

1216
01:18:16,757 --> 01:18:18,223
Go!

1217
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,884
Go! Go! Go!

1218
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:53,475
Shit!

1219
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:57,179
So while we wait and watch the demise

1220
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,014
of young karin Carter,

1221
01:18:59,082 --> 01:19:02,050
let's have a talk with our studio audience.

1222
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:06,822
You're the supervisor. You can do it.

1223
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:09,091
I don't know if I can.

1224
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:11,860
Cut every phone line into this building.

1225
01:19:11,928 --> 01:19:15,563
<i>Imagine, if you can,</i>

1226
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:17,632
<i>just for a moment,</i>

1227
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,904
<i>that she is your daughter,</i>

1228
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:25,573
<i>a child you have given birth to.</i>

1229
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:28,076
<i>Only now...</i>

1230
01:19:28,144 --> 01:19:32,580
<i>To be completely, utterly helpless</i>

1231
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:35,217
<i>and unable to save her.</i>

1232
01:19:39,473 --> 01:19:40,856
Oh, my.

1233
01:19:40,924 --> 01:19:43,591
Where is my daughter?

1234
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:45,660
I don't know.

1235
01:19:45,728 --> 01:19:48,496
And what will you do now?

1236
01:19:48,564 --> 01:19:50,165
Shoot me?

1237
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:53,702
<i>Folks at home, ed.</i>

1238
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:55,304
<i>Ed, folks at home.</i>

1239
01:19:57,673 --> 01:19:59,774
<i>Enjoying the show, ed?</i>

1240
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:05,613
<i>At moments like this, I bet you're thinking,</i>

1241
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,582
<i>"where is God?"</i>

1242
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:09,584
<i>I have that same dilemma.</i>

1243
01:20:09,853 --> 01:20:13,822
<i>Oh, look at that response, ed.
They love you.</i>

1244
01:20:19,295 --> 01:20:22,831
<i>What I am...</i>

1245
01:20:22,899 --> 01:20:24,833
<i>Is not my fault.</i>

1246
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:26,835
<i>It's not even my choice.</i>

1247
01:20:26,903 --> 01:20:32,007
<i>I came to be because of what you are.</i>

1248
01:20:32,075 --> 01:20:36,078
<i>They love you so much,
they want you dead, ed.</i>

1249
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:42,717
<i>Face it, folks.</i>

1250
01:20:42,785 --> 01:20:47,189
<i>To kill is in your nature.</i>

1251
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,827
What the hell happened to the phone lines?

1252
01:20:52,896 --> 01:20:55,714
Where's my audience? Where's my audience?

1253
01:20:57,683 --> 01:20:59,118
Parker!

1254
01:21:43,663 --> 01:21:47,932
<i>Put down the weapon, or we will open fire.</i>

1255
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:21,933
Chief!

1256
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:25,304
I want that goddamn
helicopter down here now!

1257
01:22:25,371 --> 01:22:26,738
Yes, sir.

1258
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:54,966
Fuck you, Parker.

1259
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:58,237
I am made of everything!

1260
01:22:58,304 --> 01:22:59,471
I am the future!

1261
01:22:59,539 --> 01:23:00,572
And you...

1262
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:05,076
You're losing your sense of humor.

1263
01:23:06,412 --> 01:23:07,912
Come on!

1264
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,317
Come on, Parker! Come on!

1265
01:23:26,266 --> 01:23:28,467
Where's the girl?

1266
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:31,470
It's not the same this time, Parker.

1267
01:23:31,537 --> 01:23:33,739
She's not your daughter.

1268
01:23:44,734 --> 01:23:46,601
Come on, Parker!

1269
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:52,391
Come on!

1270
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,493
Arggh!

1271
01:23:56,796 --> 01:23:58,430
Where's the girl?

1272
01:23:58,498 --> 01:24:00,732
Where's the girl?

1273
01:24:15,048 --> 01:24:17,015
Banzai!

1274
01:24:26,826 --> 01:24:28,259
Jump, Parker!

1275
01:24:30,162 --> 01:24:33,565
Come and get the little girl, Parker!

1276
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:35,684
Arggh!

1277
01:24:38,838 --> 01:24:40,539
Come on!

1278
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,941
Come on, yeah. Attaboy.

1279
01:24:43,008 --> 01:24:45,109
You can do it.

1280
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,459
O.K., Parker. This one's for me.

1281
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:11,262
Now...

1282
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,431
Where is the girl?

1283
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:21,640
Where's the girl?

1284
01:26:23,643 --> 01:26:26,077
Blow me, Parker!

1285
01:26:56,609 --> 01:27:01,513
Parker--Parker--Parker-- Parker--Parker--

1286
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:06,485
park-park-park-park-park-
park-park-park-park-park--

1287
01:27:14,594 --> 01:27:16,394
Parker!

1288
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:21,132
So, Mr. Barnes,

1289
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,634
by destroying SID,

1290
01:27:22,702 --> 01:27:25,637
you've effectively lost any chance you had

1291
01:27:25,705 --> 01:27:27,706
of finding the little girl.

1292
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:31,676
No!

1293
01:27:40,452 --> 01:27:42,888
Arggh!

1294
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:45,356
Yeah! You made it!

1295
01:27:45,424 --> 01:27:48,059
Come on, Parker! Come on!

1296
01:27:48,127 --> 01:27:50,495
Come on. You can make it.

1297
01:27:50,563 --> 01:27:52,397
Oh, goody!

1298
01:28:11,951 --> 01:28:14,953
Hey, Parker, this one's for me.

1299
01:28:23,328 --> 01:28:24,796
Parker!

1300
01:28:29,035 --> 01:28:30,468
Hey, maddy.

1301
01:28:30,536 --> 01:28:32,604
You just missed Parker.

1302
01:28:34,006 --> 01:28:36,274
Where is she?

1303
01:28:37,643 --> 01:28:40,244
You can't kill me, maddy.

1304
01:28:40,312 --> 01:28:42,547
Where is she?

1305
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:44,348
She's waiting, mommy.

1306
01:28:44,416 --> 01:28:46,217
Ha ha!

1307
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:01,933
Show me Madison.

1308
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:12,276
<i>Tell me where my daughter is!</i>

1309
01:29:12,344 --> 01:29:13,778
Do you see?

1310
01:29:13,846 --> 01:29:16,781
Sid assumes he's still in the real world.

1311
01:29:16,849 --> 01:29:19,818
<i>Come on, maddy. Forget the kid.</i>

1312
01:29:19,885 --> 01:29:21,319
Where is she?

1313
01:29:21,386 --> 01:29:23,755
Do you really want to know?

1314
01:29:23,823 --> 01:29:24,889
Yes.

1315
01:29:24,957 --> 01:29:27,826
Do you really, really want to know?

1316
01:29:27,893 --> 01:29:30,528
Just click your heels three times.

1317
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,534
Oh, karin!

1318
01:29:36,602 --> 01:29:39,070
Mommy's here!

1319
01:29:39,138 --> 01:29:41,072
She's here?

1320
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:42,941
Yes! She is.

1321
01:29:43,009 --> 01:29:45,143
She's been here all along.

1322
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,378
Uh-huh.

1323
01:29:50,382 --> 01:29:51,850
You're dead.

1324
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:54,853
And you're back in the box.

1325
01:29:56,421 --> 01:29:57,856
This is vr?

1326
01:29:58,157 --> 01:29:59,590
That's right.

1327
01:29:59,658 --> 01:30:01,259
Get us out, Billy.

1328
01:30:01,326 --> 01:30:03,444
Get them out now.

1329
01:30:03,446 --> 01:30:06,430
Madison first.
Help me lift her out.

1330
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:09,934
<i>They couldn't have done this
without you, Daryl.</i>

1331
01:30:10,002 --> 01:30:12,170
I'll go lower Barnes.

1332
01:30:12,237 --> 01:30:13,571
<i>Daryl!</i>

1333
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:17,241
I'm back in the fucking box?

1334
01:30:17,309 --> 01:30:21,179
Smart. That's my boy.

1335
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:23,514
Anytime now, Billy.

1336
01:30:23,683 --> 01:30:24,816
<i>Daryl!</i>

1337
01:30:24,884 --> 01:30:26,117
<i>Daryl!</i>

1338
01:30:26,185 --> 01:30:27,451
<i>Daryl!</i>

1339
01:30:27,519 --> 01:30:28,953
<i>Help me, Daryl!</i>

1340
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:32,423
<i>I'm back in the box, Daryl! Help me!</i>

1341
01:30:32,491 --> 01:30:33,975
<i>Daryl!</i>

1342
01:30:34,193 --> 01:30:36,761
<i>Daryl! Why did you betray me?</i>

1343
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:38,763
<i>Daryl!</i>

1344
01:30:38,831 --> 01:30:40,699
<i>Judas!</i>

1345
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:43,968
<i>Judas, Daryl!</i>

1346
01:30:44,036 --> 01:30:46,204
Billy?

1347
01:30:46,271 --> 01:30:47,505
No!

1348
01:30:54,714 --> 01:30:59,184
<i>You're in my world now!</i>

1349
01:31:44,764 --> 01:31:49,033
Get away from that, or I'll kill you, too!

1350
01:32:14,593 --> 01:32:17,095
<i>Parker!</i>

1351
01:32:17,163 --> 01:32:20,098
<i>Get in here!</i>

1352
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:22,600
<i>Come on! I want to play!</i>

1353
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:27,405
I don't know what the two
of you think you're doing,

1354
01:32:27,472 --> 01:32:29,908
but you will not--

1355
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:32,310
<i>i want to play!</i>

1356
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:33,711
<i>I want to play!</i>

1357
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:35,046
<i>Coward!</i>

1358
01:32:35,114 --> 01:32:37,515
<i>Parker! I want to play!</i>

1359
01:32:37,817 --> 01:32:40,084
<i>I want to play!</i>

1360
01:32:40,152 --> 01:32:44,388
<i>I want to play, Parker!</i>

1361
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:50,028
Let's go get your little girl.

1362
01:32:59,638 --> 01:33:01,973
All right! Watch your step!

1363
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:06,611
Come on! All right! You're clear.

1364
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,453
Karin!

1365
01:33:15,805 --> 01:33:17,755
Don't!

1366
01:33:17,823 --> 01:33:19,257
It's booby-trapped.

1367
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:21,526
The bomb squad's five minutes away.

1368
01:33:21,594 --> 01:33:24,095
Well, we don't have five minutes.

1369
01:33:24,163 --> 01:33:28,099
I'm going to the other side of the roof!

1370
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:31,102
Karin!

1371
01:33:36,641 --> 01:33:40,078
Listen, I'm going to get you out of there.

1372
01:33:44,483 --> 01:33:46,117
Hurry!

1373
01:33:54,659 --> 01:33:56,427
Hurry!

1374
01:34:01,267 --> 01:34:03,067
Hurry!

1375
01:34:11,944 --> 01:34:13,077
Hurry!

1376
01:34:13,145 --> 01:34:15,780
Hang on, sweetheart. I'm coming.

1377
01:34:15,915 --> 01:34:18,616
Just stay right where you are.

1378
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:20,051
Hurry.

1379
01:34:28,427 --> 01:34:30,094
Get me out of here.

1380
01:34:30,162 --> 01:34:31,829
It's all right, sweetheart.

1381
01:34:31,897 --> 01:34:34,799
We're going to get you out of here.

1382
01:34:34,866 --> 01:34:37,601
You're going to get me out of here?

1383
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:40,604
Yes. I'm going to get you out.

1384
01:34:40,672 --> 01:34:42,273
Be careful, Parker.

1385
01:34:42,441 --> 01:34:43,741
Hi, mom. Hurry.

1386
01:34:43,809 --> 01:34:46,577
Wait, wait, wait! Don't move! Don't move!

1387
01:34:52,267 --> 01:34:55,453
<i>Hello, Parker. That can only be you.</i>

1388
01:34:55,455 --> 01:34:59,290
<i>Anything you can think of,
I've already thought of,</i>

1389
01:34:59,358 --> 01:35:01,959
<i>and I thought of it first,</i>

1390
01:35:01,961 --> 01:35:05,964
<i>so I made this recording in
case you got clever.</i>

1391
01:35:06,031 --> 01:35:08,466
Just stay right where you are.

1392
01:35:08,533 --> 01:35:10,268
Don't move.

1393
01:35:14,973 --> 01:35:17,741
He's got you sitting on a pressure plate.

1394
01:35:17,809 --> 01:35:19,944
Now, if you stand up...

1395
01:35:20,012 --> 01:35:22,713
It's going to be very bad.

1396
01:35:22,781 --> 01:35:24,915
O.K.? All right.

1397
01:35:26,852 --> 01:35:30,288
Be still, honey. Don't move.

1398
01:35:32,324 --> 01:35:34,258
It's o.K., baby.

1399
01:35:34,326 --> 01:35:36,327
Hang in there.

1400
01:35:42,868 --> 01:35:45,169
Don't move, honey.

1401
01:35:45,504 --> 01:35:47,671
Mom, get me out of here.

1402
01:35:47,739 --> 01:35:50,208
We will, baby. Just stay still.

1403
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:55,646
Mom. Mommy.

1404
01:35:55,714 --> 01:35:57,148
Hold on, baby.

1405
01:35:57,216 --> 01:35:59,650
All right. Just talk to mommy.

1406
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:01,052
Mamma.

1407
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:04,622
I'm right here, sweetie.

1408
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:14,765
Try to get into the main operating system

1409
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:17,135
and reset the internal clock.

1410
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:25,309
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.</i>

1411
01:36:25,377 --> 01:36:27,211
<i>Better try again.</i>

1412
01:36:27,546 --> 01:36:28,662
No!

1413
01:36:28,964 --> 01:36:31,282
Oh, God!

1414
01:36:32,651 --> 01:36:34,185
<i>Faster!</i>

1415
01:36:38,557 --> 01:36:41,459
Hang on, baby. Everything's going to be o.K.

1416
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:43,261
I love you, karin.

1417
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:05,049
Connect this side to the input...

1418
01:37:12,924 --> 01:37:15,859
And this one goes to the output.

1419
01:37:15,927 --> 01:37:17,928
Now, which one's the output?

1420
01:37:17,996 --> 01:37:19,930
Which one's the output?

1421
01:37:19,998 --> 01:37:22,933
Let's see.

1422
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:26,170
Eeny-meeny-miny-mo.

1423
01:37:27,906 --> 01:37:29,440
Output, output, output.

1424
01:37:29,508 --> 01:37:32,243
It might be this one right here.

1425
01:37:32,311 --> 01:37:34,312
Parker?

1426
01:37:37,282 --> 01:37:39,484
Be it, please.

1427
01:37:53,448 --> 01:37:57,635
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.</i>

1428
01:37:57,637 --> 01:37:59,703
<i>Better try again.</i>

1429
01:37:59,771 --> 01:38:01,539
<i>Faster.</i>

1430
01:38:01,607 --> 01:38:02,873
<i>Faster!</i>

1431
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:04,275
<i>Faster!</i>

1432
01:38:06,311 --> 01:38:08,329
It's not working.

1433
01:38:08,396 --> 01:38:09,447
God!

1434
01:38:09,515 --> 01:38:10,781
Mommy!

1435
01:38:12,384 --> 01:38:14,151
Mommy!

1436
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:23,161
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.</i>

1437
01:38:23,228 --> 01:38:25,163
<i> Uh-uh-uh.</i>

1438
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,431
<i>I thought of that one, too.</i>

1439
01:38:27,499 --> 01:38:29,433
It's working.

1440
01:38:29,501 --> 01:38:31,001
What?

1441
01:38:31,069 --> 01:38:34,572
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.</i>

1442
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,073
It's working.

1443
01:38:36,141 --> 01:38:39,210
It's working? We're o.K.?

1444
01:38:39,278 --> 01:38:40,678
We're o.K.?

1445
01:38:40,745 --> 01:38:43,481
Oh, my God!

1446
01:38:43,549 --> 01:38:45,015
<i> Uh-uh-uh...</i>

1447
01:38:46,985 --> 01:38:48,586
Mommy!

1448
01:38:48,654 --> 01:38:51,355
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

1449
01:38:51,423 --> 01:38:54,091
All right, sir. Watch it.

1450
01:39:09,908 --> 01:39:13,043
Thank you.

1451
01:41:05,924 --> 01:41:07,658
* Daa

01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:33,250
* only when I'm moving?

1458
01:41:33,318 --> 01:41:38,188
