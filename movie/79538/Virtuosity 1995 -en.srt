that I was angry?
That I'm violent?

298

01:24:34,568 --> 01:24:36,619
Arggh!

1329
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:41,474
Come on!

1330
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,876
Come on, yeah. Attaboy.

1331
01:24:43,943 --> 01:24:46,044
You can do it.

1332
01:24:58,825 --> 01:25:01,394
O.K., Parker. This one's for me.

1333
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:12,197
Now...

1334
01:26:12,265 --> 01:26:14,366
Where is the girl?

1335
01:26:20,574 --> 01:26:22,575
Where's the girl?

1336
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:27,012
Blow me, Parker!

1337
01:26:57,544 --> 01:27:02,448
Parker--Parker--Parker--
Parker--Parker--

1338
01:27:02,515 --> 01:27:07,420
park-park-park-park-park-
park-park-park-park-park--

1339
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:17,329
Parker!

1340
01:27:20,133 --> 01:27:22,067
So, Mr. Barnes,

1341
01:27:22,135 --> 01:27:23,569
by destroying SID,

1342
01:27:23,637 --> 01:27:26,572
you've effectively
lost any chance you had

1343
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,641
of finding the little girl.

1344
01:27:30,143 --> 01:27:32,611
No!

1345
01:27:41,387 --> 01:27:43,823
Arggh!

1346
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:46,291
[Sid] Yeah! You made it!

1347
01:27:46,359 --> 01:27:48,994
Come on, Parker! Come on!

1348
01:27:49,062 --> 01:27:51,430
Come on. You can make it.

1349
01:27:51,498 --> 01:27:53,332
Oh, goody!

1350
01:28:12,886 --> 01:28:15,888
Hey, Parker, this one's for me.

1351
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:25,731
Parker!

1352
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:31,403
Hey, maddy.

1353
01:28:31,471 --> 01:28:33,539
You just missed Parker.

1354
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:37,209
Where is she?

1355
01:28:38,578 --> 01:28:41,179
You can't kill me, maddy.

1356
01:28:41,247 --> 01:28:43,482
Where is she?

1357
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:45,283
She's waiting, mommy.

1358
01:28:45,351 --> 01:28:47,152
Ha ha!

1359
01:29:00,834 --> 01:29:02,868
Show me Madison.

1360
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,211
<i>Tell me where my daughter is!</i>

1361
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:14,713
Do you see?

1362
01:29:14,781 --> 01:29:17,716
Sid assumes he's still
in the real world.

1363
01:29:17,784 --> 01:29:20,753
<i>[Sid] Come on, maddy.
Forget the kid.</i>

1364
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,254
Where is she?

1365
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:24,690
Do you really want to know?

1366
01:29:24,758 --> 01:29:25,824
Yes.

1367
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:28,761
Do you really, really want to know?

1368
01:29:28,828 --> 01:29:31,463
Just click your heels three times.

1369
01:29:34,935 --> 01:29:37,469
Oh, karin!

1370
01:29:37,537 --> 01:29:40,005
Mommy's here!

1371
01:29:40,073 --> 01:29:42,007
She's here?

1372
01:29:42,075 --> 01:29:43,876
Yes! She is.

1373
01:29:43,944 --> 01:29:46,078
She's been here all along.

1374
01:29:46,145 --> 01:29:48,313
Uh-huh.

1375
01:29:51,317 --> 01:29:52,785
You're dead.

1376
01:29:52,852 --> 01:29:55,788
And you're back in the box.

1377
01:29:57,356 --> 01:29:58,791
This is vr?

1378
01:29:59,092 --> 01:30:00,525
That's right.

1379
01:30:00,593 --> 01:30:02,194
Get us out, Billy.

1380
01:30:02,261 --> 01:30:04,379
Get them out now.

1381
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:07,365
Madison first. Help me lift her out.

1382
01:30:07,601 --> 01:30:10,869
<i>[Sid] They couldn't have
done this without you, Daryl.</i>

1383
01:30:10,937 --> 01:30:13,105
I'll go lower Barnes.

1384
01:30:13,172 --> 01:30:14,506
<i>[Sid] Daryl!</i>

1385
01:30:14,574 --> 01:30:18,176
I'm back in the fucking box?

1386
01:30:18,244 --> 01:30:22,114
Smart. That's my boy.

1387
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:24,449
Anytime now, Billy.

1388
01:30:24,618 --> 01:30:25,751
<i>Daryl!</i>

1389
01:30:25,819 --> 01:30:27,052
<i>Daryl!</i>

1390
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,386
<i>Daryl!</i>

1391
01:30:28,454 --> 01:30:29,888
<i>Help me, Daryl!</i>

1392
01:30:29,956 --> 01:30:33,358
<i>I'm back in the box, Daryl!
Help me!</i>

1393
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:34,910
<i>Daryl!</i>

1394
01:30:35,128 --> 01:30:37,696
<i>Daryl! Why did you betray me?</i>

1395
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:39,698
<i>Daryl!</i>

1396
01:30:39,766 --> 01:30:41,634
<i>Judas!</i>

1397
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:44,903
<i>Judas, Daryl!</i>

1398
01:30:44,971 --> 01:30:47,139
Billy?

1399
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:48,440
No!

1400
01:30:55,649 --> 01:31:00,119
<i>You're in my world now!</i>

1401
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:49,968
Get away from that,
or I'll kill you, too!

1402
01:32:15,528 --> 01:32:18,030
<i>Parker!</i>

1403
01:32:18,098 --> 01:32:21,033
<i>Get in here!</i>

1404
01:32:21,101 --> 01:32:23,535
<i>Come on! I want to play!</i>

1405
01:32:23,603 --> 01:32:28,340
I don't know what the two
of you think you're doing,

1406
01:32:28,407 --> 01:32:30,843
but you
will not--

1407
01:32:31,194 --> 01:32:33,245
<i>i want to play!</i>

1408
01:32:33,312 --> 01:32:34,646
<i>I want to play!</i>

1409
01:32:34,714 --> 01:32:35,981
<i>Coward!</i>

1410
01:32:36,049 --> 01:32:38,450
<i>Parker! I want to play!</i>

1411
01:32:38,752 --> 01:32:41,019
<i>I want to play!</i>

1412
01:32:41,087 --> 01:32:45,323
<i>I want to play, Parker!</i>

1413
01:32:48,461 --> 01:32:50,963
Let's go get your little girl.

1414
01:33:00,573 --> 01:33:02,908
All right! Watch your step!

1415
01:33:04,343 --> 01:33:07,546
Come on! All right! You're clear.

1416
01:33:15,255 --> 01:33:16,388
Karin!

1417
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,690
Don't!

1418
01:33:18,758 --> 01:33:20,192
It's booby-trapped.

1419
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,461
The bomb squad's five minutes away.

1420
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:25,030
Well, we don't have five minutes.

1421
01:33:25,098 --> 01:33:29,034
[Man] I'm going to the
other side of the roof!

1422
01:33:29,102 --> 01:33:32,037
Karin!

1423
01:33:32,105 --> 01:33:34,706
[Muffled cry]

1424
01:33:37,576 --> 01:33:41,013
Listen, I'm going to
get you out of there.

1425
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:47,052
Hurry!

1426
01:33:55,594 --> 01:33:57,362
Hurry!

1427
01:34:02,202 --> 01:34:04,002
Hurry!

1428
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:06,438
[Karin crying]

1429
01:34:12,879 --> 01:34:14,012
Hurry!

1430
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,715
Hang on, sweetheart. I'm coming.

1431
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:19,551
Just stay right where you are.

1432
01:34:19,853 --> 01:34:20,986
Hurry.

1433
01:34:29,362 --> 01:34:31,029
Get me out of here.

1434
01:34:31,097 --> 01:34:32,764
It's all right, sweetheart.

1435
01:34:32,832 --> 01:34:35,734
We're going to get you
out of here.

1436
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:38,536
You're going to get me
out of here?

1437
01:34:38,604 --> 01:34:41,539
Yes. I'm going to get you out.

1438
01:34:41,607 --> 01:34:43,208
Be careful, Parker.

1439
01:34:43,376 --> 01:34:44,676
Hi, mom. Hurry.

1440
01:34:44,744 --> 01:34:47,512
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't move! Don't move!

1441
01:34:53,202 --> 01:34:56,388
<i>Hello, Parker.
That can only be you.</i>

1442
01:34:56,390 --> 01:35:00,225
<i>Anything you can think of,
I've already thought of,</i>

1443
01:35:00,293 --> 01:35:02,894
<i>and I thought of it first,</i>

1444
01:35:02,896 --> 01:35:06,899
<i>so I made this recording
in case you got clever.</i>

1445
01:35:06,966 --> 01:35:09,401
Just stay right where you are.

1446
01:35:09,468 --> 01:35:11,203
Don't move.

1447
01:35:15,908 --> 01:35:18,676
He's got you sitting
on a pressure plate.

1448
01:35:18,744 --> 01:35:20,879
Now, if you stand up...

1449
01:35:20,947 --> 01:35:23,648
It's going to be very bad.

1450
01:35:23,716 --> 01:35:25,850
O.K.? All right.

1451
01:35:27,787 --> 01:35:31,223
[Madison] Be still, honey.
Don't move.

1452
01:35:33,259 --> 01:35:35,193
It's o.K., baby.

1453
01:35:35,261 --> 01:35:37,262
Hang in there.

1454
01:35:43,803 --> 01:35:46,104
Don't move, honey.

1455
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:48,606
Mom, get me out of here.

1456
01:35:48,674 --> 01:35:51,143
We will, baby. Just stay still.

1457
01:35:55,014 --> 01:35:56,581
Mom. Mommy.

1458
01:35:56,649 --> 01:35:58,083
Hold on, baby.

1459
01:35:58,151 --> 01:36:00,585
All right. Just talk to mommy.

1460
01:36:00,653 --> 01:36:01,987
Mamma.

1461
01:36:03,056 --> 01:36:05,557
I'm right here, sweetie.

1462
01:36:12,765 --> 01:36:15,700
Try to get into the
main operating system

1463
01:36:15,768 --> 01:36:18,070
and reset the internal clock.

1464
01:36:22,926 --> 01:36:26,244
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought
of that one, too.</i>

1465
01:36:26,312 --> 01:36:28,146
<i>Better try again.</i>

1466
01:36:28,481 --> 01:36:29,597
No!

1467
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:32,217
Oh, God!

1468
01:36:33,586 --> 01:36:35,120
<i>Faster!</i>

1469
01:36:39,492 --> 01:36:42,394
Hang on, baby. Everything's
going to be o.K.

1470
01:36:42,462 --> 01:36:44,196
I love you, karin.

1471
01:37:02,615 --> 01:37:05,984
Connect this side to the input...

1472
01:37:13,859 --> 01:37:16,794
And this one goes to the output.

1473
01:37:16,862 --> 01:37:18,863
Now, which one's the output?

1474
01:37:18,931 --> 01:37:20,865
Which one's the output?

1475
01:37:20,933 --> 01:37:23,868
Let's see.

1476
01:37:23,936 --> 01:37:27,105
Eeny-meeny-miny-mo.

1477
01:37:28,841 --> 01:37:30,375
Output, output, output.

1478
01:37:30,443 --> 01:37:33,178
It might be this one right here.

1479
01:37:33,246 --> 01:37:35,247
[Madison] Parker?

1480
01:37:38,217 --> 01:37:40,419
Be it, please.

1481
01:37:54,383 --> 01:37:58,570
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought
of that one, too.</i>

1482
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:00,638
<i>Better try again.</i>

1483
01:38:00,706 --> 01:38:02,474
<i>Faster.</i>

1484
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:03,808
<i>Faster!</i>

1485
01:38:03,876 --> 01:38:05,210
<i>Faster!</i>

1486
01:38:07,246 --> 01:38:09,264
It's not working.

1487
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:10,382
God!

1488
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:11,716
Mommy!

1489
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:15,086
Mommy!

1490
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:24,096
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought
of that one, too.</i>

1491
01:38:24,163 --> 01:38:26,098
<i>
Uh-uh-uh.</i>
