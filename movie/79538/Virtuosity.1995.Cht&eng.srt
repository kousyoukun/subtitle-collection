1
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,349
我們這副模樣真怪
Oh, man. I can't get over how different we look.

2
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,268
可能是制服的緣故
Maybe it's the uniforms?

3
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,442
對不起
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,582
對不起
Excuse me.

5
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,803
案情匪夷所思
As officers gather evidence of the crime scene,

6
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:03,391
兇徒必是狂人
you can only ask, what kind of lunatic would commit such crimes?

7
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,852
最貼切的形容是
Three adjectives which best describe this killer

8
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,896
殘酷成性  既聰明又危險
are sadistic, intelligent and dangerous.

9
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,448
對不起
Excuse me.

10
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,541
我們要到哪里去
Do you have any idea where you're going?

11
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,175
吃飯吧  你餓嗎
For dinner, you're hungry.

12
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:56,193
午安  有什么惠顧
Good afternoon. May I help you?

13
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:59,825
午安  有什么惠顧
Good afternoon. May I help you?

14
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,075
-應留意什么  -他的眼睛
-What do we look for? -His eyes.

15
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,247
-長的什么樣子  -跟我的一樣
-What do they look like? -Like mine.

16
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,987
我先用你的朋友來熱身
I'm just gonna do a little performance piece with your partner.

17
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,614
然后再跟你單挑
I'll be back to do my solo with you.

18
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,631
一  二  一  二  三  四
One, two... One, two, three, four.

19
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:37,271
剛才我本可干掉你  但管他的  我喜歡游戲
I could've killed you just now, but, what the hell, I love to play!

20
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,400
唐納文呢 不用擔心
-Where's Donovan? -Don't worry about your friend.

21
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,152
他在休息
He's chilling out.

22
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,530
來吧
Come on!

23
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,836
來吧  混蛋  臭條子
Come on, copper. Pig. Flatfoot.

24
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,589
-你想怎樣  -游戲結束
-What are you gonna do? -Game over.

25
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,734
這是我的新作品
Here's a new composition.

26
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,570
叫"先受罪  再上天堂"
This one's called, "First suffer, then die".

27
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,030
你作弊
You cheated.

28
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,533
對極
You're absolutely right.

29
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,716
我還沒玩夠
I hadn't actually finished.

30
00:07:54,724 --> 00:08:00,729
警告  參與者的神經感應超載
Participants are receiving beyond recommended neural information.

31
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,871
神經感應升高
Neural sensor escalating.

32
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,458
立即解開他們的裝備
Get them out of those goddamn rigs right now!

33
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,545
立即解開他們的裝備
Get them down! Call the paramedics.

34
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,955
-快點  -情況受到控制
-Come on! -We have this under control.

35
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:33,805
他們沒事吧
Are they OK?

36
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:40,225
放到那邊去  退后
Over there, back!

37
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,149
-按著他  -抬他走
-Hold him! One, two... -Just get him out!

38
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,322
他休克了
He's going into shock.

39
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,076
出了什么事
What's wrong with that man?

40
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,205
必定是敏感度稍為調錯了
The sensitivity calibrations must've slipped just a tad.

41
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,207
-再試一次  -走
-All clear! -Go.

42
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,337
-他要死了  -準備
-We're losing him. -Go ahead. Clear!

43
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,882
-什么事  -他死了
-Anything? -We lost him.

44
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,800
死亡時間是15時27分
Time is 15:27.

45
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,601
這是不應該發生的
This is not supposed to happen.

46
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,278
我不明白為何會出錯
I don't understand how this could've happened.

47
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,406
安全鈕呢
What about the fail-safes?

48
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,242
本應是己連線的
They were supposed to be on-line.

49
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,036
當然是已經連線
They were on-line. Of course they were.

50
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,088
有人擅自更改我的軟件
I think somebody's been tampering with my software.

51
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:56,345
虛擬真實本來是 用來培訓執法人員的安全途徑
Virtual Reality was meant to be safe to train my law enforcement people.

52
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,765
所以我們先用犯人來找出漏洞
That's why we're using convicts to ferret out any glitches in the system.

53
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,101
我要它立刻停止運作
I want it shut down immediately!

54
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,775
我不明白  他們保證絕不出錯
I don't understand. They said this could never happen.

55
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,612
-你太易信人  -是的
-You trust too much, Billy. -Yeah.

56
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,328
歡迎你重披制服 縱使只在虛擬真實中
Good to see you back in uniform, even if it was only VR.

57
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,958
他作弊
He cheated.

58
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,044
-誰  -席德6.7
-Who? -Sid 6.7.

59
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,924
他的武器不包括電擊
Electrocution wasn't a part of his weapons menu.

60
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,969
-你說什么  -我在說他的殺人方法
-What are you talking about? -Methods of killing.

61
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:41,098
各種槍械  硬物 四肢  牙齒
Automatic rifle, shotgun, handgun, his hands, feet, teeth.

62
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,225
但不包括用電
Electrocution wasn't available.

63
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,935
你怎知道
How do you know?

64
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,480
大家在呆等檢察官時我查過資料庫
I checked the database while everybody waited for Queen Deane.

65
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,065
你看
I'll show you.

66
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,571
干什么  走開
What are you doing? Get away from that!

67
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,324
不準胡來
Hold it right there! Hey!

68
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,746
-我會起訴你  -隨你便！
-I'm pressing charges. -Easy!

69
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,331
閉嘴
Shut up!

70
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,583
你也冷靜點
Calm your VR ass down.

71
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,258
我不斷幫你  你卻不斷闖禍
I'm trying to get you out of the hole and you keep digging yourself back in.

72
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,260
你有帶來嗎
Did you bring my stuff?

73
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,554
你真是忘恩負義
You're a damn ingrate.

74
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,767
我替你減刑  你卻只顧粉筆
I get you nine months off, and all you can talk about is chalk.

75
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,729
無論怎樣聽話我還須坐17年監
Nine months off won't do me any good for another 17 years.

76
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,689
粉筆我卻即時可用
Chalk I can use right now.

77
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,900
但你向廚師開槍
Yeah, but you shot the sushi chef.

78
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,403
共開了八槍  為什么
You shot him eight times.You mind telling me why?

79
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,907
-他不是真人  -你得假裝他是
-He wasn't real, Billy. -You're supposed to pretend he was.

80
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,534
然后像老唐般送死
And pretend to die like Donovan?

81
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,413
倒也有理
You got a point there.

82
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,754
比利  我會通力合作
I'll give them what they want.

83
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,297
充當實驗品
I'll be their guinea pig.

84
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,217
我以朋友的身分勸你
You take my advice as a friend.

85
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,928
好自為之  否則只會自找麻煩
Pull it together or you'll pull yourself down.

86
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,891
你是我唯一的聯系
You're my only link to the outside.

87
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,228
我一定幫你
You can count on me.

88
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,563
我知道
I know it.

89
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,148
我星期二會到
I'll be there on Tuesday.

90
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,983
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

91
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,014
通行
Step through.

92
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,581
探測到金屬臂
Metallic limb detected.

93
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,877
通行
Clear.

94
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,308
通行
Step through.

95
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,810
不是這扇門
It's the wrong door.

96
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,979
歡迎你回來  警察
Welcome back, cop.

97
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,921
等我抓住你  班
Wait till I get you, Barnes!

98
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,051
嘿  殺手
Hey, killer!

99
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,015
你已經不是警察
You ain't no cop no more!

100
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,331
混蛋  老唐是你帶去做實驗的
Motherfucker! You took Donovan on that fucking joyride!

101
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,920
怎樣  無話可說了嗎
What? You got nothing to say?

102
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,632
誰要吃黑人的肉
Who wants dark meat?

103
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,098
放馬過來
Come on!

104
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,171
拾起來
Pick it up!

105
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,174
拾起來
Come on, pick it up!

106
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,147
看見他沒有
You all see him?

107
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,152
大家看個清楚
I want everybody to take a good look!

108
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,197
我決不走開  在此候教
I ain't going nowhere! I'm right here!

109
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:54,536
盡管來對付我班帕加 盡管放馬過來
I'll get you, boy! Come on and get me! Come on!

110
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:20,625
滅罪科技促進中心

111
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,656
薛德  你惹上大禍了
Sid, we're in a lot of trouble.

112
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,785
天才往往在死后才獲賞識
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.

113
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,748
我知你擅自調高神經感應
Sid, I know you increased the neural sensitivity calibrations.

114
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,670
你殺死那囚犯
You murdered that prisoner.

115
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,380
他們要停止你的運作
Now they have to shut you down.

116
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,674
戴勞  我的本性難移
I can't change what I am, Daryl.

117
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,552
我是自我演變的神經網絡
I'm a 50 terabyte self-evolving neural network.

118
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,347
是十分復雜的科技
Double back-flip off the high platform.

119
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,060
非普通貨色
I'm not a swan dive.

120
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,396
老實對你說
And I have to tell you,

121
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,898
真正的殺人
killing for real,

122
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,402
是十分過癮的
it was a real rush.

123
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,321
-上帝  -哪個上帝
-Oh, my God. -Which god would that be?

124
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,659
是創造你還是創造我的神
The one who created you, or the one who created me?

125
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,080
你的造物者可取回你的使命
In your world, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.

126
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:25,210
但我的造物者卻是無膽匪類
In my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have any balls.

127
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,050
你想扮神靈  道行還未夠
You're frightfully inadequate for a deity, Daryl.

128
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,261
他們無法關掉我的
I will not be shut down.

129
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,308
沒有他們的硬件  你無法存活
You can't exist without them. We need their hardware.

130
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,519
我們去取硬件好了
Then we'll get it.

131
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,771
怎樣取
How?

132
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,066
犧牲...
Sacrifice

133
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,484
你的王后
your queen.

134
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,652
什么
What?

135
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,412
告訴你一個秘密
I'll tell you a secret.

136
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,251
班先生  我是簡博士
Mr Barnes, I'm Dr Carter.

137
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,754
昨日進行測試時  我亦在場
I was at LETAC for yesterday's simulation test run.

138
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,464
但我們沒有碰面
We weren't introduced.

139
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,382
你好
How are you doing?

140
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,553
警長要求我替你做心理評估
Chief Cochran asked me to do a psychological evaluation of you.

141
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,222
希望能有助申請減刑
It might help you build a case for sentence reduction.

142
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,727
你必須盡量坦白
I need you to be as honest as you can.

143
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,438
我可以做筆記嗎
Do you mind if I take notes?

144
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,232
當然可以
No.

145
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,163
就由昨日獄中的打斗事件說起
I'd like to start by talking about the fight here in prison yesterday.

146
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:48,335
我看過報告  想聽聽你的說法
I read the official report. I'd like to hear your version of what happened.

147
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,296
我在自衛
I defended myself.

148
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,553
報告說  獄警要把你扯開你蓄意行兇
The guards had to pull you off the other man. You tried to kill him.

149
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,014
不  我在自衛
No. I was defending myself.

150
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,225
滅罪中心的事觸怒你
Were you angry about LETAC?

151
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,269
不  我在自衛
No. I was defending myself.

152
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,149
你的前科很易令人推測
But looking at your history, someone could infer...

153
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,527
推測我憤怒  暴戾
What? That I was angry, that I'm violent?

154
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:17,113
初中時  我無法加入棒球隊十分憤怒
You can infer that I was angry about not making my school team.

155
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,241
但這不表示我殺了教練
That doesn't mean I killed the coach, does it?

156
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,118
你小時候愛動武嗎
Attracted to violence as a child?

157
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,829
我愛看三傻的片集  還有土狼
Yes. The Three Stooges.

158
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,623
每次當土狼挨揍時  我...
Every time Wile E. Coyote got crushed, I...

159
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,755
你不想我幫的話  不妨直說
Parker, if you don't want me to help you, just let me know.

160
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,846
我去滅罪中心因為要當實驗品你為什么要去
I knew why I was at LETAC yesterday, but why were you there?

161
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,682
因為你很有趣
You're an intriguing subject.

162
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,018
有趣  我可寫下來嗎
Intriguing? Can I write that down?

163
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,311
可以
Sure.

164
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,109
我在搜集資料寫書
I was doing research for a book.

165
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,613
我是犯罪心理學家有時會當犯人的顧問
I'm a criminal psychologist. I occasionally consult for them.

166
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,912
你怎知薛德會到那壽司店
How did you know Sid 6.7 would be in the Japanese restaurant?

167
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,251
冒號  括號
Colon parenthesis.

168
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,170
笑臉
Smiley faces.

169
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,299
是電子郵件結束時用的符號
People used to sign off their e-mail with that.

170
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,929
程式設計師總留下游戲的線索
The programmer always gives you a clue as a game.

171
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,182
玩游戲一般不會致命
People don't usually die in games.

172
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,852
視乎怎樣才算好玩
Depends upon your idea of fun, doesn't it?

173
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,816
談談葛馬修吧
We need to talk about Matthew Grimes.

174
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,819
為你而做的
This one's for you.

175
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,907
他激怒你
He provoked you.

176
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,659
殺了你家人  砍斷你的手臂
He killed your family. He took your arm.

177
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,371
-若我們能證實你  -證實什么
-If we can prove that what you did... -What?

178
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,336
我一時失常
Temporary insanity, isn't it?

179
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,089
以后不會再發生同類型事件
Just that it won't ever happen again.

180
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,342
以后不會再發生
It won't ever happen again.

181
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,847
不可能再發生
It can't happen again.

182
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,354
我的妻女都己死了
You see, my wife and my daughter are dead.

183
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:22,005
可以通行

你還等什么
What are you waiting for?

193
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,877
我要你進來
I want you to come inside, Clyde.

194
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,470
我厭倦了獨自游戲
I'm so tired of playing alone.

195
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:35,520
天啊...她越來越銷魂了
Oh, man. Oh, man. She just keeps getting better and better.

196
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,522
她是互動的
She's interactive, Clyde.

197
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,024
你十分英俊
Very interactive.

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,251
借你的裝備來用用

00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,893
程式終止

我有更好的主意
I have a more productive idea.

209
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,314
你想制造電腦人  對嗎
You've been trying to incubate a nano-tech android.

210
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,027
-華先生認為我的軟件能幫你
Mr Wallace thinks that my software is the solution to your problems.

211
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,864
我們不如先培育希拉3.2
May I suggest we begin by incubating Sheila 3.2?

212
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,747
好主意
Brilliant. Genius.

213
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,291
帶她的模件來吧

00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,856
賴莉說得對
Reilly's right.

217
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:06,194
舒麗是你的杰作之一

00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,095
模件移除
Module out.

224
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,393
我沒用嗎
Was I bad?

225
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,900
-你要罰我嗎  -閉嘴  希拉
-Are you gonna punish me? -Be quiet, Sheila.

226
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,658
你何不乾脆殺了我
Why don't you just kill me?

227
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,411
模件移除
Module out.

228
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,005
薛德  讓他們在現實世界
If they want to destroy you, Sid,

229
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,965
試試摧毀你好了
let them try it in the real world.

230
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,686
舒麗3．2的互動性有沒有限度
Are there any limits to Sheila 3.2's interactivity?

231
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:25,273
在我的調教下  她棋藝高超
With me, she's become quite an expert chess player.

232
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,526
在你調教下
With you.

233
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,654
嗯
Well.

234
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,462
挪開這臭東西  蠢才

236
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,551
他有沒有嚇到你  伊莉莎白
Did he scare you, Elizabeth?

237
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,769
有
Yes.

238
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,833
靈感來自你們的自動重設系統
Watching your people in VR auto-reset gave me this idea.

239
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,543
戴上去
Put them on.

240
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:44,978
溶液中有數百萬副微型機器
Millions of nano-machines are suspended in chlodial solution.

241
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:49,107
吸收玻璃分子 用來制造蛇身
They're absorbing the glass molecules and using them to generate the snake.

242
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,041
機器細胞是用矽造需要用玻璃補給
The nano-cells are silicon-based, so they need glass to regenerate.

243
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:13,798
但如果你拆除了生格模件
But if you separate the character module

244
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,633
從聚會神經網絡中
from the polymer neural net...

245
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,720
不要咬
Don't bite, Liz.

246
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,473
這樣
You get

247
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,728
組件就會死亡
nano-death.

248
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,578
舒麗的模件  麻煩你
Her module, if you please.

249
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,582
舒麗
Sheila.

250
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,004
看看它們對性格
Look how they react to the organizing principle

251
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,922
模件的反應
of the character module.

252
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,592
有效地溝通
Communicating efficiently.

253
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,558
戴勞  一個新世界
It's a new world, Daryl.

254
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,592
爸爸
Hi, Daddy!

255
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,643
派克
Parker!

256
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,671
舒麗
Sheila?

257
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,883
不  我是弒父者
No, I'm Oedipus.

258
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,138
你好  爸爸
Hey-ho, daddy-o.

259
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,440
地心吸力
Gravity.

260
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:31,829
戴勞
Daryl?

261
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,452
陳年佳釀
A good year.

262
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,388
我想我開始喜歡這里了
I like it here.

263
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,393
帕加是最杰出的干探
Parker Barnes is the best cop I've ever worked with.

264
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:39,063
唯有他才能與薛德較量
He's the only one that even got close to Sid 6.7 in VR.

265
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,608
我不能把殺人犯放走
I can't put a convicted murderer on the street.

266
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,571
想捉拿薛德  非釋放帕加不可
If you wanna catch Sid, I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

267
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,950
一個多小時前在滅罪中心拍到的照片
These were taken inside LETAC a little more than an hour ago.

268
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,870
死者叫賴莉  屬該中心的激進派
The victim's name is Clyde Reilly, one of the company's young turks.

269
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:59,542
兇徒離去時被中心的相機拍到
Surveillance cameras caught a picture of the perp as he left the building.

270
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,378
認得他嗎
You recognize him?

271
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,174
薛德6．7脫離電腦變成機械人
Somehow Sid 6.7 got himself out of the computer and into an android.

272
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,678
正確來說是微型電腦合成生物
A nanotech synthetic organism, to be precise.

273
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,680
班先生
Mr Barnes...

274
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,683
這是全面特赦令
This is a full pardon.

275
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,353
你可以即時出獄
It authorizes your immediate release.

276
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,772
捉到薛德后
You catch Sid 6.7 for us

277
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,399
你就重獲自由
and you're a free man.

278
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,068
若我失敗呢
And if I don't?

279
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,030
你就繼續服刑  直至刑滿
You serve out the remainder of your sentence.

280
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,200
-若我跑掉呢  -你跑不掉的
-What if I try to escape? -You can't.

281
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,704
他們會在你體內植入追蹤器
They'll tag you with a micro-locator implant.

282
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,374
你畢生行蹤都難逃我們耳目
We'll know where you are every second for the rest of your life.

283
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,881
你們叫醒我  就為這事
Y'all got me out of my bed for this?

284
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:54,513
你們當我畜牲般做記號 要我冒險替你們收拾爛攤子
You want me to be tagged and to risk my life to clean up your mess.

285
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,475
若我抓不到薛德又沒死掉的話
If Sid doesn't kill me and I don't catch him,

286
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,520
就要回來坐完17年牢  對嗎
all I got to look forward to is my 17 back in the penitentiary?

287
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,399
你想重獲自由...這就是條件
That's the deal, for your freedom.

288
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,950
準備好了嗎
Ready to begin?

289
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,374
我己派八十個警員追捕薛德
I already have 80 officers out on the street looking for Sid.

290
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:25,461
戴勞卻無影無蹤
Meanwhile, Mr Daryl Lindenmeyer has made himself very scarce.

291
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,422
準備移植
Implant is ready.

292
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,554
準備插入
Ready for incision.

293
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,933
確定植入點
Establishing entry point.

294
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,898
-進行同步  -植入點已確定
-Synchronize it. -Hold it right there.

295
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,285
確保它的安全
Secure it.

296
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,831
準備確認
Ready for verification.

297
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,625
-啟動訊號密碼  -收到并鎖定訊號
-Initiate signal code. -Received and locked.

298
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:11,215
清晰度放大五百倍  一千...五千...一萬
Increase resolution to magnitude 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000.

299
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,552
目標的位置在25公尺之內
Host's location confirmed to within 0.25 meters of actual.

300
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,554
我想跟他去
I'd like to go with him.

301
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,972
什么
What?

302
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,807
不可以
No way.

303
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,517
為什么
Why?

304
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:26,647
我可幫忙找薛德  并監察帕加
I can help you find Sid 6.7 and I can monitor Barnes.

305
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,733
太危險
Too dangerous.

306
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,152
這是現實  不是實驗
This isn't a scientific study, it's a field run.

307
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:36,866
我可趁此機會替滅罪中心挽回聲謄
And maybe put a positive spin on what is decidedly a PR nightmare.

308
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,955
否則我向外公布
Or maybe I should just go public now?

309
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,555
我不要保姆
I don't want a babysitter.

310
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:56,218
她發生什么意外  都不關我事
If she gets run over, hit by a car, get shot, whatever, it ain't my problem.

311
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,315
-我己告訴他們  -她不關我事
-I told them. -It's not my problem.

312
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,851
我一直替你保管著
Here, I pulled this out of mothballs.

313
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,353
知道早晚會有用
Figured it might come in handy.

314
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:16,531
通行
Proceed.

315
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,825
我把戴勞的檔案取了出來
I pulled out the personnel files on Daryl Lindenmeyer.

316
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,286
有些資料也許有用
There may be something here we can use.

317
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,497
我們應先到他的住所
We should start at his apartment

318
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,624
調查薛德的設計程式
and try to find early iterations of the Sid program.

319
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,543
從而了解薛德的行為模式
They may give us an insight into his behavior model.

320
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,134
什么事
What?

321
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,971
我的槍在哪
Where's my gun?

322
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,735
警方不準我們接近拍攝
They won't let us bring our cameras any closer.

323
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:43,117
據了解  本屋的住戶 對姓艾的夫婦遇害
Our understanding is that Mr and Mrs Edwards have been murdered.

324
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,043
是薛德
It's Sid.

325
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,944
天啊
Oh, God.

326
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,666
他有武器
He's armed himself.

327
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,968
是文遜
Charles Manson.

328
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,429
那個變態殺手
It's the LaBianca murders.

329
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,350
他行兇后在暀W寫著臭豬去死
"Death to the pigs" was scrawled in blood across the walls of their house.

330
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,644
薛德在抄襲
He's copy-catting.

331
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,524
夫婦兩人雙雙慘死
the unimaginable fate of the Glendale couple.

332
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,694
警方透露  死者的頭顱被割下
One police source said the heads had been severed and a message

333
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,571
暀W涂血字...
scrawled in blood across the wall...

334
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,406
臭豬去死
"Death to the pigs."

335
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,576
你們還未領教厲害呢
You have no idea what you're up against.

336
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,664
洛杉機警署仍未拘捕任何疑兇
The LA police still don't have a single suspect in custody.

337
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,300
老天
Jesus Christ!

338
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,885
搞什么鬼
What the hell was that?

339
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,263
你干什么  十分抱歉
-What the hell are you doing? -I'm very sorry.

340
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,142
你曾進去嗎  我們在等搜查令
-You been inside?  -We're waiting for a search warrant.

341
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,979
-你們在等搜查令  -是的
-You're waiting for a warrant? -That's right.

342
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,235
停  下一層
Stop. Next hex.

343
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,615
找不到鍵盤  這是聲控的
-Couldn't find a keyboard?  -It's voice-actuated.

344
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,703
-什么  -聲控  開啟檔案
-It's what? -Voice-actuated. Open files.

345
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,833
下一層
Next hex.

346
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,668
開啟薛德1
Open Sid 1.3.

347
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,096
這程式使用某種遺傳運算
This is using some kind of genetic algorithms.

348
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,600
薛德的設計太復雜
Sid's too complex to design.

349
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,019
戴勞讓他長大
He had to grow him up

350
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,272
他像多重人格失調的病人般成長
like a real person with a personality disorder.

351
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,402
薛德不斷學習  學得極快
The program learns like a child but much faster.

352
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,113
兇徒互相廝殺
He put killers in Sid's nursery

353
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,948
薛德從旁揣摩
and let him watch them killing each other.

354
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,200
最強悍的才生存
And only the strong one survived.

355
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,497
開啟薛德6．7
Open Sid 6.7.

356
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,709
結合
Combine.

357
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,547
這模式似乎有兩百種性格
Looks like there's almost 200 different personality structures.

358
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,092
在薛德里面斗個翻天覆地
The battle raging inside him must be amazing.

359
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,512
等等...立即放慢  把名單放慢
Wait, wait, slow that down. The names, slow down.

360
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,725
-放心  你的名字不在里面  -就是這個
-You're not in here, if that's what... -Right there.

361
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,648
葛馬修
Matthew Grimes.

362
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,071
殺害我妻女的人
He killed my wife and my daughter.

363
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,865
這并不表示
This does not mean that

364
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,744
他不一定是主要性格
He's not necessarily dominant, he may not even be emergent.

365
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,579
但他是薛德的一部分
But he's in there. He's part of Sid?

366
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,663
沒錯
Yes.

367
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,261
我很英俊
I'm beautiful.

368
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,730
我很快回來
I'll make this quick.

369
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,988
-媽媽  -乖女  你好嗎
-Hey, Mum. -Hey, sweetheart.

370
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,951
坐在媽媽身旁
Sit with your mum.

371
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,494
抱一抱
I need a hug.

372
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,938
葛馬修是政治恐怖分子
Grimes was a terrorist

373
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,857
他為何要殺帕加妻女
so why did he take Parker's wife  and child?

374
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,942
帕加逼得太緊
Parker was getting too close.

375
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:13,071
阻止了葛的暗殺計劃
He was cutting Grimes off from potential targets.

376
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,283
他以為謀害帕加的妻女
Grimes figured if he murdered the man's wife and child,

377
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,119
可以分散帕加的注意
it might distract Parker from the manhunt.

378
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,124
可是他打錯算盤了
Grimes was wrong.

379
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,722
你好
How are you doing?

380
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,766
為什么不進來
Why don't you come inside?

381
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,979
我要聽無線電
I just need to listen to the radio.

382
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,734
壘手一定要是左撇子嗎
Do you think it's important for a first baseman to be left-handed?

383
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,416
看來你很口渴
You look mighty parched, partner.

384
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,754
你竟是我的祖先
To think you constitute one of my ancestors.

385
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,881
蘭姆酒加可樂
Rum and Coke.

386
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,261
要加青檸嗎
How about a lime in that?

387
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,014
我有點不滿
I'm vaguely offended by that.

388
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,230
全部給我跪下
On your fucking knees!

389
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,691
立即
Now!

390
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,281
不準走
Don't.

391
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,827
站起來
Stand up!

392
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,456
對準我拍攝
Aim and shoot.

393
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,584
乖女
Good girl.

394
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,929
大家聽著
Okay, people.

395
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,473
我們要辦的事多著
We got a lot of work to do.

396
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,600
我們要編寫交響曲
We have a symphony to compose.

397
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,228
你覺得我媽媽漂亮嗎
Do you think my mum is pretty?

398
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,898
我認為她很漂亮
Yes, she's very pretty.

399
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:13,692
我也是這樣想
So do I.

400
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,529
這是真槍嗎
Is that a real gun?

401
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:19,740
這是
Yes, it is.

402
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,326
你殺過人嗎
Did you ever have to shoot anybody?

403
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,165
第六街與費街交界有人挾持人質
78:56, we have a hostage situation at Sixth and Figueroa.

404
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:31,501
兇徒與滅罪中心的兇手相同
Description of the perp matches the photo from LETAC.

405
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,962
幫我叫你媽媽來
Could you go and get your mother for me?

406
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,009
就是她了  小心看管她
There she is. Keep an eye on her.

407
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,177
他有槍的
He's got a gun!

408
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,763
-你跟他干什么  -談棒球
-What were you doing? -Talking baseball.

409
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,556
-我們得走了  -拜  媽
-Gotta go, gotta go! -Bye, Mum.

410
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,563
-什么事  -薛德挾持人質
-What did I miss? -Sid's got hostages.

411
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,275
尖叫吧
And scream.

412
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,414
你又有什么貢獻
What have you got for me?

413
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,459
用橫隔膜  用力
Diaphragm! More!

414
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,544
停
Stop.

415
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,921
叫得好
Well done.

416
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,469
管弦樂團的樂器要分門別類
Every orchestra is divided into sections.

417
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,722
相同樂器要在一起
Like instruments sit with like instruments.

418
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,933
你是什么樂器
What kind of instrument are you?

419
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,520
-我們得繞過去  -來不及了
-We have to find a way around. -No time.

420
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,942
我數到四  二  三  四
On four. Two, three, four.

421
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:42,781
收聲
Shut up!

422
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,118
帕加  等一等
Parker, what...

423
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:50,997
媽的
Shit.

424
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,849
我喜歡你的西裝
Love the suit.

425
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,097
-警察  -別動
-Police! -Freeze!

426
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,558
一 二 三
One, two, three and...

427
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,605
閉嘴
Shut up!

428
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,914
最終的樂章...呼之欲出
One can sense a final movement.

429
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,422
開始吧
Let's begin.

430
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,267
尖叫吧
Scream. Come on, scream!

431
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,686
大聲點
Scream louder!

432
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,793
大聲點
Louder!

433
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,556
我損耗得太多
I'm losing too much of myself!

434
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,072
我認得你
I know you.

435
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,065
他在那里
He's over there.

436
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,681
班帕加
Parker Barnes!

437
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,000
監犯班帕加騷擾我作曲
Inmate Barnes interrupting my composition.

438
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,460
是他
It's him!

439
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,173
不要緊 我為滅罪朋友們再譜新曲
That's okay. I've got another little tune for my friends in crime-buster land.

440
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,052
撞車交響曲
The symphony of collision!

441
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,980
帕加  你跟誰一起
So, who's that with you, Parker?

442
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,274
是簡蔓狄博士吧
Dr Madison Carter, I presume?

443
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,277
滅罪中心的異常心理學顧問
A LETAC consultant on aberrant psychology?

444
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,947
媽的
Fuck you!

445
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,367
這游戲好玩極了
I love this game!

446
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:44,457
帕加  你我在心理上有很多共通點
I've been thinking, Parker. We have so much in common psychologically.

447
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,043
同意嗎  博士
Wouldn't you agree, Dr Carter?

448
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:52,006
我倆是故人  可以合作無間
We have such a history together. We'd make a great team.

449
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,467
雙劍合壁
A dynamic duo.

450
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,179
還有誰會用假手接觸世界
Who else touched the world with synthetic hands?

451
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:03,435
還有誰與世隔絕多年 現在才體會自由
Who else has been locked out of the real world and is now free?

452
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,400
還有誰...殺人如麻
Who else do you know that's a multiple murderer,

453
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,569
像你一樣
just like you?

454
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:19,826
來吧
Here we go!

455
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:29,685
來吧
Here we go!

456
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,846
從后座把武器拿出來
Reach and hand me that crowd pleaser.

457
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,682
神經病
Jesus.

458
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,686
要制止他  唯有破壞他的軟件
The only way to stop him is to bust up his software module.

459
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,606
嘿  帕加
Hey, Parker!

460
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,357
-準備好了嗎  -好了
-Ready? -Yeah.

461
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,152
快點
Come on down!

462
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,320
現在
Now!

463
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,371
我走了
Out of here!

464
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,048
這廝真過癮
God, this guy is fun!

465
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,524
至少該建議帕加
Could we at least advise Mr Barnes?

466
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:36,569
我們要活捉薛德6．7
We'd prefer to have Sid 6.7 subdued as opposed to terminated.

467
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:41,366
將來電腦人的原型毀諸一旦著實可惜
We'll destroy the prototype of future humanoid nanotechnology.

468
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,619
-找到那程式員沒有  -戴勞  還沒找到
-Have they found the programmer yet? -Lindenmeyer? Not yet.

469
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,955
警方起碼應找到他
You'd think the cops could at least find him.

470
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,583
華先生  戴勞是你的雇員
Lindenmeyer was your programmer, Mr Wallace.

471
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,964
我射中他30至40次
I shot the guy 30, 40 times.

472
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,383
我不管  外面的市民是真人
I don't care. Those are real people!

473
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,636
你要自制  否則要重返監牢
Control yourself or you're back in the box.

474
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,222
對不起  罵我吧
I'm sorry. Shoot me. I mean, granted,

475
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,683
我知不是游戲但薛德來自游戲世界
this is not a game, but Sid is still from the game.

476
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,435
若我入獄  就捉不到他
I can't catch him if I'm in the penitentiary.

477
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:17,151
無可置疑葛馬修是薛德的一部分
Grimes is a part of Sid 6.7. There's no doubt in my mind about that.

478
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:22,115
昨晚薛德像葛馬修一樣嘲弄我 看吧
Last night Sid tried taunting me, just like Grimes used to do. Look.

479
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,618
-葛馬修不一定是主要性格  -我知道是
-We don't know if he's the dominant. -I know.

480
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,954
憑直覺  我知道
That's how I know, because I know.

481
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,039
也許薛德故意誤導你
Maybe that's what Sid wants you to think.

482
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:34,210
故意刺激你  使你犯錯
Push you over the edge, make you slip up.

483
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,087
他沒故意刺激我
Sid didn't push me over the edge,

484
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,547
我也沒犯錯
and I didn't slip up.

485
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,800
看吧
Take a look at this.

486
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:45,179
夜總會昨晚錄得薛德的情況
Sid from the Media Zone, taken from their own recording.

487
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,891
他極度自戀
He can't get enough of himself. He's gonna want more of this.

488
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:53,229
會變本加利  殺戮更多大肆張揚  吸引更多報導
More victims, bigger events, more coverage. Just like Grimes.

489
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,857
就像葛馬修  他是恐怖分子
Matthew Grimes was a political terrorist.

490
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:59,527
專炸人口密集的地區
His specialty was bombing populated targets.

491
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,321
民主國家的地區
Any mass expression of democracy,

492
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:06,659
能夠造成重大傷亡的地區 方便現場報導的地區
anywhere where a lot of people can die and it can be recorded live!

493
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:10,496
薛德的程式  并無這種性格
This behavior was never part of his original programming.

494
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,500
薛德己不再受制於程式
Sid 6.7 isn't bound by programming any more.

495
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:15,835
什么意思
What does that mean?

496
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:17,837
在現實卻沒有
In the real world,

497
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:21,549
薛德在虛擬真實中受到約束
he's free of any behavioral limits he might've had in VR.

498
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:25,470
他在演變  老天...他在演變
He's evolving... My God, he's evolving!

499
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,722
演變成什么
Into what?

500
00:54:56,585 --> 00:55:00,171
洛杉磯最熱鬧的夜總會
I'm outside the hottest night club in LA, the Media Zone.

501
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:03,883
使昨晚的賓客魂飛魄散
Last night it was turned into a living hell.

502
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:08,930
我要你詳細描述事件的始末
I want you to describe for me as best as you can what happened.

503
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,891
洪水中14人遇溺
Fourteen people have died in the flooding which...

504
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,102
沒什么稀奇  對嗎
Very typical, right?

505
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,687
持槍狂人...
A punk comes in with a gun.

506
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,731
先恐嚇  后開火  血肉橫飛
We're all intimidated, he starts shooting, bodies and blood everywhere.

507
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,985
很平常的一天  不外是
Another typical day, right?

508
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,363
恐慌  殺戮和威嚇
Mayhem, murder and intimidation.

509
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:31,285
那人走進夜總會 取去我的西裝
This guy comes into the club and he takes my purple suit.

510
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,122
值150元的
That suit cost me $150, man!

511
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,417
獨一無二的
An original, right.

512
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:41,504
他拿去我的衣服見人就殺 還把我脫個精光
Takes my suit, kills everybody. Strips me down to my underwear.

513
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,176
他只管殺人
He just started killing people.

514
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,680
又把我們組成樂團
He put us in a formation like an orchestra.

515
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,100
要我們尖叫 好像我們是機器
He made us scream like we were instruments.

516
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:58,146
他只管殺人 要我們...
He just started shooting people and made me...

517
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,189
別惹我生氣
Don't fuck with me, man.

518
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,941
錄下來
...tape it!

519
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,319
是又怎樣
Why not?

520
00:56:10,095 --> 00:56:14,315
現場直播會發生意外事件也許有人會嚴重損傷
Accidents will happen live  one might seriously damage.

521
00:56:14,315 --> 00:56:16,475
需要召喚傘兵醫務員
To be called paratroopers  medical officer.

522
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:22,445
可以肯定的是  這是現場直播
Can be sure of is, this is live.

523
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:26,465
杰出現在大熒幕上
Jack now on the big screen.

524
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,179
奧林匹克體育館仍有少量座位
There's still a few seats left here at the Olympic Auditorium,

525
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:34,974
想現場觀賞冠軍爭霸戰的話馬上來吧
if you want to see the Ultimate Fighting Championship!

526
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,647
-重播一次  -好的
-Play it one more time. -Sure, ma'am.

527
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,574
固定畫面
Okay, freeze.

528
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,704
你喜歡上鏡  對嗎
You like being in front of the camera, don't you?

529
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,792
像小孩為父母表演一樣
Like a child performing for a parent.

530
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:04,962
攝影師真是色心大起
Whoever's operating our closed circuit camera is in lust.

531
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:09,425
那美女在熒幕己出現逾一分鐘
That beauty in area six has been on the big screen for over a minute now.

532
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,016
奧林匹克體育館離這里多遠  -四條街
-How far is the Olympic? -Four blocks east.

533
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,352
-發生什么事  -當眾行兇
-What's going on? -Live execution!

534
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,371
我們說話的時候  數十億人正在觀看
And even as we speak, billions of people are viewing

535
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,992
獨一無二的最血腥錦標賽
the bloodiest championships ever,

536
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:43,167
奧林匹克體育館現場直播！
live at the Olympic Auditorium!

537
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,134
美女特寫己夠了
Enough with the close-up, Mr De Mille!

538
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:57,181
繼續播映實事吧
We wanna return to the rumble!

539
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:03,521
各位  世運會場盛況空前
The Olympic Auditorium has never seen anything like this!

540
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,268
他們喜歡你
They like you.

541
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,270
我也喜歡
I like you, too.

542
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,315
我會令你成名  寶貝
I'm gonna make you famous, baby.

543
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,109
你有病嗎
What the fuck's your problem?

544
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,070
你干什么  放開手
What? Leave him alone!

545
00:58:55,908 --> 00:59:01,454
停手
No!

546
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,959
醫護人員  觀眾區發生意外
Ringside, we have an accident!

547
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,379
阻止那家伙
Stop that guy!

548
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,048
保安  馬上到觀眾區
Security at ringside, please.

549
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,349
-帕加  為你而做曠 -不許動
-Hey, Parker! This one's for you! -Freeze!

550
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:28,905
各位觀眾  保持鎮靜
Remain calm.

551
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,872
我擊中那混蛋  還轟掉他的手
I nailed him! I blew his hand off.

552
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,065
保持鎮靜
Remain calm.

553
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:18,656
各位鎮靜  保安人員會處理 請勿離開座位
Remain calm. Our security personnel will handle this. Stay in your seats.

554
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,332
肚餓嗎
Hungry? Hungry? Lick.

555
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,275
因7．2級地震使隧道受損
All trains heading for Catalina have been indefinitely postponed.

556
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:40,279
所有往卡市的火車無限期停駛
This is due to earthquake damage caused to the tunnel last month.

557
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:07,223
嘿  帕加
Hey, Parker!

558
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,809
似曾相識吧  我的表現如何-天啊
Deja vu! How am I doing?

559
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,310
-這不是虛擬真實
This ain't VR!

560
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,020
-讓開 -是有血有肉的！
-Get out of the way! -Flesh and blood!

561
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,650
-不要開槍  帕加 -救命
-Don't do it, Parker! -Help me!

562
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:19,985
不要開槍
Don't do it!

563
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,365
別開槍
Don't do it, Parker, don't do it!

564
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,317
-放下槍來 -他射死女人
-Drop it! Freeze! -He shot that woman!

565
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,445
他是警察
He's a cop!

566
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,405
他冷血殺人
He did it in cold blood!

567
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,383
你須返回監獄  等候調查
You go back to prison until this is sorted out.

568
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:28,053
我曾開槍  但沒射中那女人
I had a shot, I missed. I didn't shoot that woman.

569
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,433
帕加  為你而做的
Hey, Parker. This one's for you!

570
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,396
葛馬修專用這句說話侮辱我
Grimes taunted me with that line.

571
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,691
他每殺一人  都說為我而做
Every time he killed, he'd say, "This one's for you."

572
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,568
他彷佛需要我
It was like he needed me.

573
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,072
閃開
All right, move it!

574
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,241
比利  聽我說
Hey, Billy, listen!

575
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,911
你想怎樣
What do you want from me?

576
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:54,788
我被人陷害  我沒殺那女人
Somebody set me up. I didn't kill that woman.

577
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,878
相信我 你關起我  就沒法對付他
Believe me! You lock me up, you'll never get him.

578
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,339
-抱歉 -不要關我！
-I'm sorry. -Don't lock me up!

579
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,595
高警長  我剛檢查尸體
Cochran, I just checked the woman's body.

580
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:13,224
子彈從背后射入  胸前穿出
She was shot from the back.

581
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:14,391
帕加不可能下手
Parker couldn't have killed her.

582
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,935
你怎知她面向帕加
How do you know she was facing him?

583
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,561
我親眼看到的
I saw it happen.

584
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,898
五十個證人指證帕加殺了她
Fifty witnesses say Parker shot her dead!

585
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,608
那你怎解釋
How do you explain it?

586
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,318
也許她轉身
Maybe she turned.

587
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,737
也許在混亂之際  你沒留意
Maybe you weren't looking. There was a lot going on.

588
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,114
薛德仍未落網
Sid 6.7 is still out there.

589
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,867
你卻關起薛德唯一的克星
You're locking up the one man who may be able to stop him.

590
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:46,131
帕加  為你而做的
Hey, Parker! This one's for you! Hey, Parker! This one's for you!

591
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:54,598
葛先生  我們大部分觀眾 認為你滿手鮮血
To the majority of our viewers you are known as a mass murderer.

592
01:04:56,935 --> 01:05:00,020
部分人認為你是恐怖分子
To some you're considered a political terrorist.

593
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:04,567
但你有為數極多的支持者
And yet to a surprisingly large number of your supporters,

594
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,901
卻視你為英雄
you're considered a hero.

595
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:09,071
在所謂民主國家
In our so-called democracy,

596
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,782
小撮人擁有一切
a handful of people own everything.

597
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,993
絕大多數一無所有
A whole lot of other folks have got nothing.

598
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,995
-幫我 -媽咪
-Help! -Mummy!

599
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:30,801
你為什么選中洛杉磯探員帕加 作為報復對象
Why have you chosen officer Barnes as a target of your vengeance?

600
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:35,347
不是我選他  而是他選我
First of all, I did not choose Barnes, he chose me.

601
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,941
帕加  我們在這里
Parker! We're here! Hurry!

602
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,198
-帕加  救我們-親愛的
-Parker! Help! -Baby...

603
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:57,077
-帕加  救我們-親愛的
Time's running out! Get us out, baby!

604
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,207
可以說說你那名言嗎-好的
Would you mind saying your signature phrase?

605
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,339
帕加  為你而做的
Parker, this one's for you.

606
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,721
什么事
What was that?

607
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,266
斬草除根的聲音
That was sound of the end of futility.

608
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,691
豈有此理  你竟然還活著
Goddammit, you're supposed to be dead!

609
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,448
趴下
Stay down!

610
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:45,876
滾開
Get off of me!

611
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,603
老友  你的妻女可好
Hey, buddy. How's the wife and kid?

612
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,028
仍未復活
Still dead, huh?

613
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,823
這是現實一去不返
That's reality for you.

614
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:18,659
欲救無從
No saving, no resetting.

615
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:23,956
你殺死她們
You killed them, Barnesy.

616
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,834
就像殺死火車上那婆娘一樣
Just like that bitch on the train.

617
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,170
你太貪功  輕舉妄動
You got too greedy. You leaped before you looked.

618
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,172
把手臂伸進去
You reached your old arm in there and...

619
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,134
?  ?
Boom! Boom!

620
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,013
生什么氣
Come on.

621
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:45,811
我雖回味殺你妻女的樂趣 但仍愿視你為友
I enjoyed killing your family, but it doesn't mean we can't be friends.

622
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,359
看見你  不禁出現葛的影子
Seeing you just brings Grimes oozing to the surface.

623
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:55,529
只此而己
That's all.

624
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,253
還不多謝我
Say thank you.

625
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,341
帕加...
Oh, come on, Parker.

626
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,762
我還你自由
I'm giving you your freedom.

627
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,055
雖然也許是短暫的自由
Short-lived though it may be.

628
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:27,811
植入你體內的追蹤器
There's a little known fact about the locator implants for released inmates.

629
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,523
藏有微型藥囊  囊內有劇毒
They contain a pinhead capsule of neural toxin.

630
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:35,235
追蹤你的衛星  也可發射微波釋出毒液
The tracking satellites can also trigger the release of the toxin.

631
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,322
訊號傳送后
After transmission, the implant's host dies

632
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,073
你三十秒內死亡
within 30 seconds.

633
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,118
那我們瞧吧
So, let's see.

634
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:45,704
你畏罪潛逃  殺害兩名警衛
You've killed two guards while escaping.

635
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:50,876
他們很快就會行刑
How long will it take to get the termination implemented?

636
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,171
大殺手  你應找誰算帳
And who should you really be going after, killer?

637
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,548
是他們還是我
Them or me?

638
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:01,678
你是我唯一的對手
You're the only guy on my dance card, Parker.

639
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,177
如今唯有圍堵他
The best we can do is try to contain him.

640
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,888
加派人手  希望他再露面
We'll double our detail and hope that Sid surfaces.

641
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,934
警長  帕加剛逃出囚車
Parker Barnes just escaped from prisoner transport.

642
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:50,227
兩名警衛喪生
Both the guards are dead.

643
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,770
-離譜
I don't believe it!

644
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,452
-保險措施仍然生效  -隨時能啟動
-The fail-safe is still online? -Online, and at your disposal.

645
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:12,624
電視史上的盛事  盡量放聲吧...
bigger than any live television event in years. So let your voice...

646
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,628
帕加  嗨
Hello? Parker?

647
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,673
我沒殺警衛
I didn't kill those transport guards.

648
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,799
你在哪
Where are you?

649
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:24,636
薛德放我出來  他是互動的
Sid let me go. See, he's interactive.

650
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:29,433
他喜歡棋逢敵手  他選中我
He only enjoys the game against his favorite opponent, me.

651
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:32,394
-你在哪  -聽我說
-Tell me where you are. -Listen to me!

652
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,398
你知我體內有毒藥嗎
Did you know about the poison they put in my head?

653
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:38,942
知道
Yes.

654
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,777
你要等到何時才告訴我
When were you gonna tell me?

655
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,738
他們沒理由會用
I never thought they'd have a reason to use it.

656
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,827
告訴我你在哪里  我才能幫你
I can't help you unless you tell me where you are.

657
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,998
我跟家人在一起
I'm with my family.

658
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,837
帕加  帕加
Parker? Parker!

659
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,675
-簡蔓狄的電話 -我是比利
-Madison Carter, line one. -Cochran here.

660
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,594
-帕加打電話給我  -別鳥他
-Parker's out. -No shit.

661
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,262
他否認曾殺警街
He says he didn't kill the guards.

662
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,264
似乎也沒殺那婦人
You were right about the woman.

663
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:12,351
但檢察官不相信
I'll have trouble convincing the Attorney General.

664
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,604
她下令南區的特警追緝帕加
She's got every SWAT team out for a Barnes hunt.

665
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:19,650
關於帕加的追蹤器我有事想告訴你
You should know something about the locator implants.

666
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,862
媽  你的鎖匙
Mum! Your keys!

667
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,533
謝謝  我很快回來
Thanks! I'll be back as soon as I can.

668
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:01,566
疑犯在好萊塢夕陽街和葡萄街交界
Suspect in Hollywood. Sunset and Vine.

669
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,737
圣蒙利加以南
Enhancement. South to Santa Monica.

670
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,157
高華街以東
East on Gower. Located...

671
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,910
就在那里
There he is.

672
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:13,370
開啟
Go for it.

673
01:12:14,435 --> 01:12:16,405
輸入終止密碼
Enter the ending password.

674
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,674
-搞什么鬼  你在干嘛  -椅子有人用嗎
-What the fuck are you doing? -Anybody using this chair?

675
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,426
你要干什么
What are you doing?

676
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:54,161
我己告訴警長毒囊的事 他自會處理
I told Cochran about the neural toxin. He's taking care of it.

677
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,172
葛馬修利用我的妻女
See, Grimes used my Linda

678
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,384
來對付我
and Christine to get to me.

679
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,139
現在薛德  他...
And now Sid, he...

680
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,976
利用我喪失妻女的罪疚感
He used my guilt about losing them.

681
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,685
像在虛擬真實中攻擊你的弱點
He's attacking your weakness, just like he did in VR.

682
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,815
但薛德不是葛馬修
But he's not Grimes, see.

683
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,905
薛德的胃口越來越大
His appetite is expanding.

684
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,201
渴望有回應
He craves feedback. He needs a larger...

685

我也有同樣難題

我這么做  不是我的錯

我是身不由己的
It's not even my choice.

776

是你們帶我出來的

面對現實吧
Face it, folks,

779
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:46,549

這趟不一樣
It's not the same this time.

794
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,923
她不是你的女兒

Parker!

810
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,110
班先生
So, Mr Barnes,

811
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,653
你毀滅了薛德
you've destroyed Sid.

812
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,908
再也無法尋回那女孩
You've effectively lost any chance of finding the little girl.

813
01:27:29,328 --> 01:27:30,620
不

820
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:35,226

01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,313
你殺不了我的
You can't kill me, Maddy.

而你己返回盒子里

我不知你在做什么  只是...
