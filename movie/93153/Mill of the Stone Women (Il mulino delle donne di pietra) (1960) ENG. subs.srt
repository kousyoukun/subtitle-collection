1
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,998
Do you know Professor Wahl?

2
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,094
I'm sorry, sir?

3
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,204
Professor Wahl, the sculptor.
l know he lives in a windmill

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,618
Is it far?

5
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,092
Other side -
near the stone women

6
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:05,831
What?

7
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,292
We call it
the Mill of the Stone Women

8
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,167
Is that it?

9
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,465
No, further on

10
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,371
Past the cemetery of Veeze

11
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,024
He wants the Mill of the Stone Women

12
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,164
We're off...

13
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,129
- Thanks
- You're welcome

14
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:52,537
Who's there?

15
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,569
Van Harnim. Hans van Harnim

16
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,438
Can l help you?

17
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,382
Professor Wahl, please?

18
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:16,719
Come in

19
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,624
Wait here, please

20
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,921
Sir...the Professor wants you
to wait in his studio

21
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:21,818
But...

22
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,253
This way, please

23
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,567
Please, sir

24
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,002
Hans van Harnim?

25
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,001
Professor Gregorius Wahl

26
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,809
l didn't expect you

27
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,179
It's a long way from Rotterdam

28
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,180
Professor Caran sent me.
I’m his assistant

29
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,683
He said you'd be expecting me

30
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,650
l didn't reply yet.
Why such haste?

31
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,291
The book's publisher
is putting pressure on

32
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,895
The monograph should be ready
for the centenary

33
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:16,896
Of course...l didn't think of that

34
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,506
The first of February,
it will be 100 years...

35
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,473
...since my great grandfather
first opened the windmill

36
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,407
So, when can you start?

37
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,049
Tomorrow, if that's all right.
Professor Caran has given me 10 days

38
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,480
Since you're here, why not start now?.

39
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,020
I'm afraid
l have very little time to spare

40
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,950
Follow me...

41
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,930
Conrad, check the brakes.
We don't want an accident

42
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,261
Yes, Professor. l'm just doing it now.

43
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,965
Careful, this floor is very cluttered

44
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,301
Here are the gears.

45
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,982
They use to run the mill,
now they give life to the statues

46
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,243
- Are they still the original statues?
- Most of them, yes.

47
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,319
- Some of them I had to duplicate myself.
You saw a few in my studio.

48
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,923
They certainly very impresive.
And you did finishing too?

49
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,889
I did everything by myself.

50
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,419
This way, please.

51
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,329
Here you are.
You can do your work in here.
Very peacefull little room.

52
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,069
I've got some documents ready for you

53
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,176
All the history of the windmill

54
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,251
Everything you need should be here

55
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,118
- Can l take them away?
- No...!

56
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:52,354
I'd prefer they remain here

57
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,263
Then l can help you with your work

58
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,370
l shall take some days' holiday

59
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,237
I’m afraid l have to go now

60
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,443
The last ferry leaves in three hours

61
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,106
Be sure you don't miss it

62
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,508
Don't worry

63
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,409
One final thing,
you must finish in six days

64
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,384
I’m sure that's enough

65
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,080
I'll leave you to it

66
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,348
Shelma!

67
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,123
Shelma...

68
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:35,364
No. no. The line is too heavy.
Try a lighter touch here

69
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:36,391
Thank you, Professor

70
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,431
Hey, Annelore, Annelore...

71
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,923
Don't distract me.
l can't even get two lines right today

72
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,084
You've been like that
ever since Hans turned up

73
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,292
Nonsense, Raab

74
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,729
You've really got your head
in the clouds today

75
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,564
What's wrong?

76
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,268
Nothing. I’m just a little tired

77
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,047
- Professor?
- Yes

78
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,876
Did a Mr Van Harnim
come to see you?

79
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,279
Do you know him?

80
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,483
Since we were children

81
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,622
Ah, childhood friends

82
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,156
He seems like
a serious young man

83
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,419
I’m sure he'll do good work

84
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:43,233
Right, that's it for today.
Class dismissed

85
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:49,204
l must cancel the class for Tuesday.
We'll meet next Friday for sculpture

86
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,705
Four days off...what bliss

87
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,315
What'll you do?

88
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,247
Go to Danzen with Hans.
That's our home town

89
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,853
Carpe Diem, Liselotte

90
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,082
It's time he settled down
before he gets too old

91
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,887
I’m sure this time he'll come with me

92
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,490
Come on, hurry up!
Hans will go if we keep him waiting

93
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:57,337
Excuse me, do you have a light?

94
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,503
Of course

95
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,441
l asked for a light...?

96
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,245
Oh yes, sorry

97
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,863
Thank you, Mr...?

98
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,624
Van Harnim...Hans van Harnim

99
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,035
Bolem...Doctor Bolem

100
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,173
Goodnight

101
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,669
Goodnight...
Excuse me

102
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,781
My legs are very pretty
And spiritual

103
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,625
There's none in this city
That look so well

104
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,361
They're made just for dancing
Olay! Olah!

105
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,496
And if l want to show them off
Well, what's the harm?

106
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,542
The rhythm of the dance
Excites you all

107
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,639
And now it's your chance
To join the ball

108
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,641
You cry in gay abandon
You lose your head

109
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,646
Forget about your troubles
And dance instead

110
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,096
And if my little ditty
Should make you warm

111
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,200
You think it's very witty
And full of charm

112
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,063
l give it all I’ve got
And then some more

113
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:40,272
To give you all some ideas
Behind closed doors!

114
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,355
Hey! You look happy

115
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,022
l got a job at the Globe in Paris.
Top billing

116
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:07,194
- So...I’ll never see you again?
- I’ll send you a postcard, Raab

117
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,101
The best of luck, Annelore!

118
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,927
Liselotte!
What're you doing?

119
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,400
Me? Nothing...
just getting a free show

120
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,432
You'll catch cold

121
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,967
When l found you'd gone,
l was worried

122
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,407
Unlike you, to worry about me

123
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,944
All right, I’m sorry

124
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,584
But your damn Professor
made me work late

125
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,315
Satisfied? No?

126
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,155
Alright then, I’ll buy you dinner

127
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,450
Come on

128
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,912
Happy faces to brighten up
my gloomy world

129
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,290
What's wrong?

130
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,660
l should have studied dance
rather than fine art

131
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,823
And what have you been up to today?

132
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,225
Oh...Playing bowIs
with Professor Wahl

133
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,561
Like to order?

134
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,700
How was Wahl?

135
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:56,706
He gave me six days to finish
and said l had to work there all day

136
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,914
Do you know him well?
Does he have a daughter?

137
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,049
A daughter?

138
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,215
l heard something...

139
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,186
l believe her mother died
in childbirth

140
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,728
And she has a strange name.
Elfy, or something

141
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,399
Elfy, that's right. What's she like?

142
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,032
No idea. No-one ever saw her

143
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:24,306
She's must be so ugly,
he keeps her locked away

144
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,940
Strange...very strange

145
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,314
Why?

146
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,115
Because she's pretty - very pretty

147
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,510
Don't you get it, Raab?

148
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,744
You know her?

149
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,387
No - but l do know...

150
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:38,614
...you!

151
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,722
Are you trying to annoy her?

152
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,658
No...she's right

153
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,258
But l didn't mean it like that

154
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,135
Do me a favor, Raab.
Have a word with her

155
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,340
Here we go again!

156
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,245
l am Elfy

157
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,992
Hans...Hans van Harnim

158
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,589
Come in...

159
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:52,620
Sit down

160
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,660
No. l can't stay, Hans.

161
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,963
l must go soon.

162
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,933
Someone's watching me.
There always is

163
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:10,572
l can't explain right now, Hans...
But l must speak to you

164
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,845
This evening

165
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,917
This evening...but where?

166
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,310
Here...

167
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,154
In the mill

168
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,118
But someone might see us

169
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,886
Is it really so urgent?

170
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,464
Yes. It’s really urgent

171
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,736
11 o'clock tonight.
They will all be asleep

172
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,629
No-one will know

173
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,576
Take this key.
It unlocks the door to the mill

174
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,443
Please...be careful

175
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,877
I’ll be waiting

176
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,197
l am tired

177
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,832
l must rest now

178
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,806
Let me accompany you

179
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,476
Good night, father

180
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,441
Good night, my dear

181
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,375
My compliments, Elfy

182
00:20:55,587 --> 00:21:00,615
l never saw you play
with such passion before

183
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,793
It wasn't for you, Bolem

184
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,429
l realize that

185
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,825
But never forget I’m the only one
who really knows you

186
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,764
And you have no right
to love any other

187
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,366
Stop it, Bolem

188
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,236
Good night

189
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:39,924
Elfy!

190
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:53,894
Hans!

191
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,298
You scared me

192
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,007
Didn't you hear me come in?

193
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:01,979
l was asleep

194
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,409
I’m sorry if l woke you

195
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,818
You seemed so keen to speak me

196
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,023
But when l came in
you were so strangely still

197
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,117
l was dreaming of you

198
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,764
How you were coming to see me
from so far away

199
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,668
l was waiting for you to arrive
and l was so happy

200
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,739
It was strange
to feel such happiness

201
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:39,008
And when l felt you there beside me
l wanted to go on sleeping

202
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,342
l was so afraid...

203
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,082
l was so afraid to wake up

204
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,816
l didn't want the dream to end

205
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,427
It was a dangerous dream, Elfy

206
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,993
Who knows where it might have ended

207
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,428
What's wrong?

208
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,070
Don't you want me?

209
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,476
Of course, Elfy. But afterwards...

210
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:14,418
Who cares about that?
What matters is that l want you now

211
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,183
Come and kiss me

212
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,219
Two friends of yours
are waiting downstairs

213
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,012
Who?

214
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,213
l don't know.
A young lady and a gentleman

215
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,182
Thanks

216
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,510
Hello, Raab.
l guessed it was you

217
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,038
But she said there were two people...

218
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,776
- Oh, Liselotte!
- l came to tell you off

219
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,977
Good. l need to hear that

220
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,521
Well, l think I’ll go off
and see these statues

221
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,742
How long have we known each other?

222
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,968
l don't know- forever

223
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,281
And you always loved me?

224
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,747
Yes. And you?

225
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,985
Well...l didn't know that l loved you

226
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,152
It’s only now l realize it

227
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,798
Now that l know what real love is

228
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,806
Your love

229
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,874
But l don't deserve it,
Liselotte

230
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,112
Why not?

231
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,481
I’m ashamed to say

232
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,457
Then don't

233
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,062
Can you forgive me?

234
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,462
Everything?

235
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:23,237
Of course, Hans...l love you

236
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,767
They scare me!

237
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,900
The Poisoner of Poitiers

238
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,258
Stop! Stop!

239
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:34,963
What is it?

240
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,998
A young woman's fallen ill

241
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,446
Miss Liselotte...!

242
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,382
So what happened?

243
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,314
l don't know.
l don't understand

244
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,291
Now wait a second.
l think l have something...

245
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,827
Here...
Get her to breathe this

246
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,898
She'll soon be alright,
you'll see

247
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,103
This sort of thing often happens here

248
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,165
How do you feel, Lotti?

249
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,477
Better, thanks.
But please let's go

250
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,611
Help her outside

251
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,141
Oh...

252
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,518
Wait a second...

253
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,887
It must have been your hat pin

254
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,155
Don't worry,
it's only a small cut

255
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:36,356
That's better.
Now you can go and get some fresh air

256
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,868
I’m sorry to be so much trouble

257
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,939
No, please, don't apologize

258
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,733
It wasn't your fault

259
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:50,005
Take care of yourself.
I’ll see you in class next Friday

260
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:57,445
Hans, l would like a word
before you go

261
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,583
Yes, Professor

262
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,511
See you soon, Raab.
And thanks...

263
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,982
Well done, Lotti.
You did it

264
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,113
Of course

265
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,054
Professor...?

266
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,057
Please, come in

267
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,868
It will probably seem strange to you

268
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:54,076
that I’m going to talk about things
to do with my family

269
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,907
But l have my reasons

270
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,582
l have a young daughter
whom l love

271
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,651
Elfy

272
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,421
She is very ill

273
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,293
As was her poor mother

274
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,094
Science is powerless to help

275
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,269
All we can do is watch and wait

276
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,005
That's why Dr Bolem lives here

277
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,203
He never leaves us - day or night

278
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:28,434
Always ready to act
should a crisis occur

279
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,973
and her life be in danger

280
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,077
Is she aware how serious it is?

281
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,818
She really understands very little

282
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,758
Or why she can't live
like other girls

283
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:47,628
It is essential that she avoids
all strong emotions

284
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,924
or her life will be in danger

285
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,296
l believe you to be honest
and trustworthy

286
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:59,533
l really hope you understand
why l have spoken to you of Elfy

287
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:05,706
It’s a request and a warning...

288
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,412
The next attack could kill her

289
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,784
You can count on me

290
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,885
You are a good boy
and l thank you

291
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,523
And now...

292
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,253
Back to work

293
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,585
l was waiting, Hans.
l knew you'd come

294
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,718
You didn't give me much choice

295
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,052
Forgive me.
l was desperate

296
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,922
l don't know why...

297
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,326
...but l had a sudden fear
you no longer wanted me

298
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,724
That you'd never come back

299
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,063
l thought of giving your letter
to your father

300
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,467
But that seemed rather unkind

301
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,709
Now l feel I’ve betrayed him

302
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,535
After he trusted me

303
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:48,451
So you would betray me?
Because my father trusted you...

304
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,111
That's not the only reason.
We made a mistake, Elfy

305
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,258
We were foolish,
but it must not continue

306
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,384
But l love you, Hans

307
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,662
l love only you.
Don't you understand?

308
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:09,539
Others have abused my trust;
taken advantage of my loneliness

309
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:19,273
l know you blame me for that.
That's why you reject me

310
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:27,721
But if only you knew
how horrible my life is

311
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,657
All day locked up in this place

312
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,458
l do understand, Elfy.
l don't blame you

313
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:45,001
But...l don't want to mislead you.
Elfy - l don't love you

314
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:52,572
So what? You can grow to love me.
l just want to be with you always

315
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:58,218
Take me away from here, Hans.
From this sad existence

316
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,057
l will go wherever you go, Hans

317
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:05,753
Please, don't talk so.
You know it's impossible

318
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,096
You have to stay here

319
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,061
We must forget
everything that happened

320
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,069
Hans! Don't lie to me

321
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,466
It’s because of that girl

322
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,037
Yes, l saw you

323
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,878
But l swear to you she won't
take you from me

324
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,413
and if she does,
I’ll kill you...

325
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,780
Elfy, stop this nonsense.
Are you crazy?

326
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,652
Yes...yes...
And that's why l want you...

327
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,688
My...my...

328
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:37,677
Dead...!

329
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,812
Good morning, Mr Hans

330
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:03,553
I’m sorry l kept you waiting.
l was just clearing up

331
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,426
What can l do for you?

332
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,531
What can I do for you?

333
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,568
l must speak to Professor Wahl.
Urgently

334
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,038
l haven't called him yet.
It’s still very early

335
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,536
l realize it's inconvenient,
but l really must see him

336
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:29,017
l can't call him now, Mr Hans.
It’s not even 7 o'clock

337
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,312
Can't you wait just a little while?

338
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,514
Yes?
What is it?

339
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,915
I’m sorry, sir.
l didn't know you were there

340
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,212
I’ll come back

341
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,180
Wait, Shelma...

342
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,182
Yes, sir?

343
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:15,450
Come in

344
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,930
Has anyone been here
since yesterday evening?

345
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,930
No-one ever comes in here

346
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,600
Did you put this rose here?

347
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,211
I’m far too busy
to collect flowers

348
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,884
That's all right, Shelma

349
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,022
Professor Wahl wants to see you

350
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,261
I’ll go now

351
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,770
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

352
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,603
No, it's nothing

353
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:11,413
I’m not so sure.
Do you have a fever?

354
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,249
You cut yourself...

355
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,250
l told you, it's nothing.
I’m all right!

356
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,548
You can't see the Professor
in this state

357
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,659
However urgent it is

358
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,258
I’m sorry, I’m a little tired

359
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:34,461
Well, let me see...
What can l give you...?

360
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:42,111
Yes, a tranquilizer.
That's just what you need

361
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,552
Two of these
and you'll feel a lot better

362
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,217
Go on, drink it

363
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,034
Soon you'll feel much better

364
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:11,165
Murderer!
You're a coward and a murderer!!

365
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:15,078
No...You must believe me

366
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,076
That's why l came here

367
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,850
To talk to you...
to tell you the truth...

368
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,957
Words! Just worthless words!
Pathetic excuses

369
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,355
You took advantage of my hospitality

370
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,061
l trusted you.
Talked to you like a son

371
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:47,208
You knew how frail my Elfy was,
but that didn't stop you

372
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,044
You killed her.
Murderer!

373
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,077
It’s not true...it's not true!

374
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:57,412
I’ll hear no more.
What use are mere words

375
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,320
No-one...no-one
can bring my daughter back

376
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,491
Elfy is dead

377
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,896
Elfy is dead and buried

378
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,790
May she rest in peace

379
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,834
Let no-one disturb her sleep

380
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,432
Let her rest in the grave

381
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,135
Whatever happens,
no-one must know the truth

382
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,810
No-one!

383
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,177
Elfy is in her tomb
in the cemetery at Veeze

384
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,286
Nothing shall sully her memory

385
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,924
Let her sleep in eternal peace

386
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,070
What...?

387
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,271
You are ill...Very ill

388
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,286
But, there was blood...there

389
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:44,521
Blood?

390
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:46,653
Why?

391
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:53,664
Why?

392
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:19,712
Elfy!

393
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,137
It’s not possible...!

394
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:05,971
It was there!

395
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,598
Mr Van Harnim,
what are doing here at this hour?

396
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,473
What's going on here?

397
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:13,768
l don't understand

398
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,379
l want to see Professor Wahl!

399
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,782
Calm down

400
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,747
Who's that woman?

401
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,081
What woman?

402
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,810
Tied up in there!

403
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,081
l don't know
what you're talking about...

404
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,892
There - take a look if you want

405
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,877
Where is Professor Wahl?
l want to see him now

406
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,210
You're in a state.
Calm down

407
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,216
Out of my way

408
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,315
Professor Wahl!

409
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,208
Who's there?

410
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,008
Hold on!

411
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,983
Conrad...Conrad,
it's all right

412
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:35,682
So, what is it?

413
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,723
Professor, l must talk to you

414
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:38,655
More lights

415
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,693
Talk to me?
It’s one in the morning...

416
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:46,027
l was trying to tell him,
but he's in such a state

417
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,728
Something's going on here.
You must explain...

418
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,065
Mr Van Harnim...

419
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,573
l think it's you
who owes me an explanation

420
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,073
Earlier today l saw you...

421
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,115
...and you forbade me
to ever mention Elfy again

422
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,846
Elfy...
What are you saying?

423
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,451
Who talked to you about her?

424
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,990
And what do you thinks’ going on?

425
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,224
Can you really not remember?

426
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,402
Or do you not want to...

427
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,733
Now l begin to understand

428
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,741
You want me to think l was dreaming

429
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:35,311
No! You can't blame me

430
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:36,980
It was not my fault!

431
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:44,759
l think you've gone mad.
What was not your fault?

432
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,089
Typical schizophrenic hallucinations

433
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:54,597
No...You want me to believe
that l saw Elfy alive

434
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,429
But what about the bracelet?

435
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:01,409
It was there on the table...
Then...

436
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,313
Then, Elfy was wearing it
in her coffin

437
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:11,217
Elfy! Elfy in her coffin?
What are you talking about?

438
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:15,753
At the cemetery of Veeze...
You told me yourself, Professor

439
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:24,898
l saw her...In her coffin.
Dead...Dead...

440
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,031
As you know!

441
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,608
Hans!

442
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,981
What's going on here?
Why all the shouting?

443
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,181
It’s nothing serious, miss

444
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,463
Go back to bed.
Don't worry, Elfy

445
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,956
Bolem, go with her

446
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:05,967
Conrad!

447
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,044
Listen...

448
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:16,178
I’m no doctor, but l can tell
you are in a disturbed state...

449
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,981
...that could be dangerous to me
and my daughter

450
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:21,515
l won't have it

451
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:22,883
Yes, Professor?

452
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,687
Get the carriage
to take Mr Van Harnim into town

453
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,625
Yes, sir

454
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,395
And you...come with me

455
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:41,568
Don't be ridiculous, Bolem.
Hans is not mad

456
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,179
You stopped him seeing me

457
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,816
Elfy, you must forget all about him

458
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,313
Never...

459
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,989
Hans means life to me

460
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,491
No. Hans for you is certain death

461
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,725
And l...
l am your life

462
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,260
Your salvation

463
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,429
You are bound to me forever

464
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:15,238
Bound to a monster like you?
You're mad

465
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:23,011
And what would your Hans say
if he found out what you really are?

466
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:30,116
l know what a rat you are Bolem.
You'd never talk

467
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,851
You're too scared to tell the truth

468
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:35,625
Now go

469
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,884
Bolem, we've done it

470
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:33,383
My plan has worked

471
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,687
l have to admit, it does seem to have

472
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:45,256
The drug you gave him
destroyed all sense of reality

473
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:48,232
lf he ever talks about it

474
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,530
They'll think him mad

475
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:54,468
Maybe...but l still think
the other solution was better

476
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,441
No. It would been too dangerous
to kill him

477
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,375
Too many people saw him here

478
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,016
So long as he lives,
he is a threat

479
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,016
Your daughter
will try to see him again

480
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,315
She will forget him in time

481
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:13,325
And after tonight's experiences,
he is unlikely ever to return

482
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,727
Indeed. But there is one fact
we can't escape...

483
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:18,366
What?

484
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,368
Elfy died tonight

485
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,002
So..?

486
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:25,304
He held her in his arms.
He will have known she was dead

487
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,209
Just another hallucination

488
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:33,975
Don't forget,
there's nothing to prove what he saw

489
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,081
l hope you're right

490
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:42,585
l shudder to think
he might see your daughter again

491
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:46,693
lf he asks her questions,
he'll discover the truth...

492
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:50,024
...that she died
and came back to life again

493
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:57,463
And if he discovers how...
it's the end for us

494
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,636
...and for your daughter

495
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:06,808
lf that does happen, we'll be forced
to try your solution

496
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:10,418
Elfy!

497
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,216
Another attack

498
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:13,249
Quick, Bolem!

499
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:23,488
Yes, yes. l will save you, Elfy.
Trust me, my darling

500
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,428
Once again l will save you

501
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,904
Get everything ready, Bolem.
I’ll fetch her

502
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:18,642
Help me, Professor!
Professor, l beg you...!

503
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:19,904
Untie me...

504
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,811
Of course, Annelore...
I’ll set you free

505
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:29,113
You won't suffer anymore, l swear it

506
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,887
Just be patient.
I’ll set you free soon...

507
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,862
Very...very soon...

508
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:42,928
Everything's ready, Professor

509
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,397
Give me that

510
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,398
See, Elfy.
Your bad blood is being drawn away

511
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,406
It'll be gone...
In just a few seconds

512
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,428
Ready, doctor

513
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:21,402
Now!

514
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:33,981
Yes, Professor

515
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:16,710
How is he, doctor?

516
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:20,488
Medically speaking, he is well.
He needs to rest

517
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,554
Just four or five days

518
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:24,857
l really thought we'd lost him

519
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,290
It was a sort of
nervous breakdown

520
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,396
A breakdown? How strange...

521
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,293
He was in such good health before

522
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,630
It is indeed strange.
l can't explain it

523
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,567
What caused it?

524
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:44,073
l have no idea.
You're his friends, you know him best

525
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,644
What can we do now?.

526
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,211
Nothing special

527
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,386
Just lift his spirits
and keep him amused

528
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,249
You're young,
that should be easy!

529
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:55,218
Thanks doctor

530
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:58,016
I’ll show you the way down

531
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,665
So, what did the doctor say?

532
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,234
Is it all over for me,
or is there a glimmer of hope?

533
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:12,203
It’s bad news, Hans.
You're almost well again

534
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:15,400
Now you will be able to escape
from me

535
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,409
l know how much you loved
playing the nurse

536
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:25,720
Especially with me lying here
all defenseless

537
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:31,883
That's right. And l loved it
when you called my name

538
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,625
You'd say:
Liselotte, l don't feel well...

539
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,859
Liselotte, don't leave me...
Liselotte, hold my hand

540
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,300
l must have been really sick

541
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,331
Go ahead and make fun of me

542
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:46,866
l don't mind now

543
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:48,903
Why not?

544
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,407
Because you let it out
when you were sick

545
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,948
Now l know you love me

546
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:59,752
You know that?
And do you know when l can get up?

547
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,679
In about three days

548
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:03,616
That's too late

549
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,160
Hans, what are you doing?

550
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:12,098
l have urgent business tomorrow.
l must go to Danzen...

551
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,931
To ask the parents
of a certain person...

552
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,799
if they will accept me
as a son in law

553
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,471
Hans, really?

554
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,343
l think you should help me this time

555
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,522
For three years l refused
and l still do

556
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:40,026
l am a doctor,
not a mummifier of women

557
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:44,387
Fine scruples for a man
kicked out of the medical council

558
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,625
Who spent many years of his life
hiding from the law

559
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:51,032
And you seem to forget
that these statues keep you safe

560
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:57,578
l still refuse to be a part
of this macabre carousel

561
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,876
l am here for one reason only:
to save your daughter's life

562
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:06,887
l could say l do it for science,
but that wouldn't be strictly true

563
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:11,083
l have no interest in your motives

564
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:16,523
l ask only one thing of you:
that you keep Elfy alive

565
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:36,701
Professor Wahl

566
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,236
What is it?

567
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,068
While you play with death,
l have conquered it

568
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,175
As you know...

569
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:48,743
l have created a serum
that will protect the red blood cells

570
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,448
But it was not permanent

571
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,585
l needed to find an exact match
for your daughter's blood group

572
01:14:55,157 --> 01:15:00,686
It was very rare...
but now l have found it

573
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:05,229
Elfy can soon live like other girls

574
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:07,333
But who is it?

575
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,171
Liselotte Cornaim!

576
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:32,023
52 steps...we could have called her
from the ground floor

577
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:35,726
Liselotte

578
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,892
Probably still asleep

579
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,099
Who's there?
What do you want?

580
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:49,341
Oh, Mr Hans...
Are you looking for Miss Liselotte?

581
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,703
I’m sorry, but she's not there

582
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:56,240
Not there?
But she was expecting us...

583
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:57,815
She might have been

584
01:15:58,253 --> 01:15:59,277
What's going on?

585
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,516
Well...l don't know if l should say

586
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:04,990
Please do

587
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:11,457
The young lady has not been back
since yesterday evening

588
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:16,237
Didn't she say anything?
leave a message for me?

589
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:20,169
Nothing at all,
or l would have told you

590
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,240
Maybe there's a note in her room

591
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,708
Maybe...
l could let you in

592
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,928
Why has she left her bag?

593
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,397
Maybe she took another one

594
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:50,697
She's also left her papers
and her money

595
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,233
What's going on?

596
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:58,238
There could be any number of reasons

597
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,579
Hey...What's up?

598
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:07,814
This girl?

599
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:09,089
Yes...

600
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:13,819
She's a red-head?

601
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,558
Yes, that's right. So what?

602
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:28,166
It’s her...
It has to be her that l saw

603
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:32,246
What do you mean?
You must have seen her in the bar

604
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,883
l never saw her before that night

605
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:49,061
But how can that be,
if it was all an hallucination?

606
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:55,163
Will this nightmare never end?

607
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:01,901
Listen Hans, l tried to question you
when you were ill

608
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:05,107
You wouldn't talk about it
and l gave up

609
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,873
Now we're getting somewhere

610
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,951
That girl with the red hair
was a model called Annelore

611
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,316
You said you saw her.
But where?

612
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:20,187
In the basement...tied up

613
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,521
What basement?

614
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:23,926
At the windmill

615
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,897
Hold on a second, let's think...

616
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,669
Annelore said
she was leaving for Paris

617
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,576
She never came back to the art class

618
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:42,311
And now you - who never saw her -
recognized her photograph...

619
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,913
and knew that she had red hair

620
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:49,485
So it was no hallucination;
you must have seen her at the mill

621
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,918
So then...it might all be true

622
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,565
All what?
This is serious, Hans

623
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,034
Tell me...

624
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,201
Tell me everything that happened

625
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:47,646
The blood has not degenerated.
We can operate on Elfy tonight

626
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:53,219
Are you sure of this?
There's no risk to Elfy?

627
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,448
No risk at all

628
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,284
Then we must not hesitate.
We'll do it tonight

629
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,062
We must prepare at once.
Please help me

630
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:21,012
Tell Conrad to put this statue
in the carousel today

631
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,010
He knows what to do

632
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:23,784
Of course

633
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:55,847
We need some physical proof
that your story is true

634
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:01,781
Of course - the cemetery...
The cemetery at Veeze

635
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,701
Just like you said

636
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:31,484
The coffin is empty.
What can that mean?

637
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:39,355
Well...

638
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:09,385
It was a dummy
you saw in the coffin

639
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,021
A wax dummy

640
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,394
The thunder scares me

641
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:27,402
When l was small l used to hide
under the bed

642
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,442
But you...you were never afraid
of anything

643
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:33,842
Because you were never alone like me

644
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:37,076
This mill was so full of shadows

645
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,017
Did you already know Hans then?

646
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,157
Did he comfort you in his arms?...

647
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:50,196
How wonderfully exciting
it must have been...

648
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,262
...to tremble in Hans' arms

649
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,604
But that's all over now, Liselotte

650
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:02,508
Hans will love me,
because you won't be here anymore

651
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:04,908
And your life will be mine

652
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:08,646
There, in this tube,
is your daughter's life

653
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:14,380
Three years of meticulous work,
Wahl...

654
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:21,188
During the transfusion,
the serum will be introduced here

655
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:24,297
Where it will be mixed
with the new blood

656
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:31,102
The serum is essential.
Without it the red cells couldn't grow

657
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:35,475
They would be destroyed
in a few months

658
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:36,666
Like a cancer...

659
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:42,140
We will have to anaesthetize
your daughter

660
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,818
The process may cause
a painful reaction in her

661
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:49,313
Apart from that,
it will be quite straightforward

662
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:54,890
Good work. l congratulate you, Bolem.
You've thought of everything

663
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,396
Almost everything

664
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,398
You sure about this, Hans?

665
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:08,735
No turning back now

666
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:35,400
Where to now?.

667
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,829
To the basement

668
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:37,901
We need light

669
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:39,197
There, by the doorway

670
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,052
Stop it! Quickly...

671
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:02,653
It’s a body...A mummified corpse

672
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:05,816
It looks like...

673
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:06,584
...Annelore!

674
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,089
Liselotte!

675
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:17,033
- She's down there
- What can we do?

676
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,398
Move this, quick!

677
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,436
Come on

678
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,144
Ready, Professor

679
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,785
Good - get to work

680
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,920
Wait a second, Professor Wahl

681
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:10,614
What it is?

682
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:17,855
Tonight will be the last time
that Elfy has need of this

683
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:19,830
And so?

684
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:24,027
You realize...l have spent years
saving her from death

685
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,339
I’ve committed crimes for her

686
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,569
and this evening,
l will be giving her new life

687
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:31,608
Your point?

688
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:36,716
l should be recompensed

689
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,579
l never quibbled about money

690
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,219
Who mentioned money?

691
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:41,453
Then what do you want?

692
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,323
Your daughter, Wahl

693
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:49,964
Do you know what you're saying?

694
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:54,127
Yes...l have loved Elfy for years

695
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:56,896
lf she lives, it's only thanks to me

696
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:59,104
Now l want her for my wife

697
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:01,072
Your wife!

698
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:09,380
You think l would give Elfy
to a creature like you?

699
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,683
A vile monster, barely worthy
to draw breath?!

700
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:17,255
lf not for me, you'd have been
locked up years ago

701
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:21,387
Be careful Wahl.
Remember that l have the power now

702
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,691
l always wanted her
and now l will have her

703
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:33,129
Are you crazy, Bolem?
l will never allow it

704
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:37,875
You will never have Elfy.
Her life will never belong to you

705
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:42,413
She will never be soiled
by a foul creature like you

706
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:46,620
For me you were nothing
but an instrument

707
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:47,782
Enough!

708
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,885
Now l no longer need you, Bolem

709
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:55,887
This is the end for you

710
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:00,561
The only face my daughter will see
when she awakens...

711
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:04,733
...will be mine!

712
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,879
Killing me...
you've killed your own daughter...

713
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:21,747
Killed her...

714
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:27,552
It’s hopeless

715
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,294
Quick! Through Wahl's studio

716
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:42,704
Elfy, tonight it will all be over.
l will cure you forever

717
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:00,889
Down here

718
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:05,998
Quickly!

719
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,089
Where's the serum?

720
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:37,225
Where...?

721
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,834
Bolem, you dog! Where is it?

722
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:04,924
No...l don't believe it!
It’s broken

723
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:49,235
Quick Raab, this way!

724
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:55,268
She's still alive

725
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:56,836
Untie her quickly

726
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:18,658
Dead...

727
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:24,099
Dead...!

728
01:32:33,447 --> 01:32:38,817
You killed her, damn you!
You will all die...! All of you!

729
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:56,430
Go on!

730
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,150
It’s all on fire!

731
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:51,886
Go through the house

732
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:25,852
Be still!....Be still, damn you!
