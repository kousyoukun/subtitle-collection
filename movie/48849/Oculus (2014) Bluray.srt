This is absolutely wonderful

8
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:45,605
This shows a deep sense of
To accept responsibility

9
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,605
And tell me you did not go beyond your illusions

10
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,604

This is my opinion that (Tim) Rashid Salim
Does not represent a danger to himself or others

13
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,600

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Way to deal with it -
Of course -

33
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,579

00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:36,576
But more importantly, to maintain your recovery

38

42
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,561
Hello, my little brother

00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:51,555
Well, studies say that the move
To a place not necessarily have to be large

46
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:54,555
So put a list of small apartments

47
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,553

Well, I wanted to tell you all this before

51
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,550
But they suddenly
Did not let me see you

52
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,548
Not ... not that they
They did not let you see me

53
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:22,547

55
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:36,543

What do you mean?

59
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,538
You know .. It was not easy

60
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,538
I had to defeat some bidders

61
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,537
It was stored
"Part of a group of collectors in the" Bremen

62
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:05,536
It took me a year and a half to be brought into our store
And stayed less than a week

63
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,534
It is on the verge shipped to the buyer of a new
We do not have only a few days

64
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,533
Should be enough

65
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,532
A few days to do what O (Kylie)?

66
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:18,531
To keep our promise

67

Well, the situation here couch

Jeff!) I am very sorry for not redial)

75
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,522

Kiley) in custody)

77

00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,513
If you are asked for more furniture

92
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:30,512
I do not know that I love you
Put this office here

93
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,512
Are you going to tell me

94
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,511

By this sort of affectation, do not you think?

100
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:04,503
I'm confused, you are wanted artifacts
And I was satisfied with the ordinary furniture

101
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:08,502
Yes, some of the pieces I wanted to improve the place
Do not turn it into a show room

102
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,501
We've got a new home

New work
So we come with new furniture

118
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:56,473

You just put the bandage -

121
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,470

Did not receive a look?

197

00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:25,256
... As you know, after

202
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,255
Can you help me with something before you leave?

203
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:43,250
How predicted the introduction of this thing alone?

204
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,249
The Secretariat did not expect
For as long as I thought it would be both of us

205
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:48,249
Put it here

206
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,239
What are these?

207
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,238
Anchor? , A button to kill

208
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:32,238
So ..

I understand if you do not want to stay
Accept this

210
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:38,236
But, to start

211
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,233
I'll stay for a while

212
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,230
Hello

213
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,228
My name is (Kylie Ann Russell) I am 23 years

214
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:08,228
Has called on the name of our father

215

The time now is 4:50 pm

On October 13
"We are in the" 2705 through Hathurn

217
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:23,223
I'll start lists precautions taken
Before you place the mirror and disclosed

218
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:26,222
There are three cameras
Each has its circle electrophysiological own

219
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:28,222
When something abnormal occurrence
Will be conclusive evidence is biased

220
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:31,221
There is a land line phone and mobile phone

221
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:34,221
And now I will ask his brother

222
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:37,220
In order to be all
Electronic devices under my control

223
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:45,218
I've just purchased

224
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:47,217
(Thank you, (Tempo

225
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:54,216

Reminds me to change the tapes cameras

226
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:57,214
This is set to ring every hour
To remind us that we eat

227
00:25:57,214 --> 00:26:00,213
We have a stock of water
To prevent us from dehydration

228
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:01,213
As for the house itself

229
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:08,211
Each room is equipped with a thermal regulator are recording data
Program is designed to measure changes in temperature in hospitals

230
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:13,210
Any change in temperature greater
Of five degrees would be warning

231
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,209
Reserve the third also in his
But I'll come back to it later

00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,209
So

233
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:24,208
The goal of today is to demonstrate experience
"The purpose for which the rear," the mirror

234
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,207
Is the home of the forces of abnormal
Can be measured and predicted

235
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:31,206
There is synonymous with scientific
The word "haunted" So we will say

236
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:36,204
To this end, responsible for 45 deaths and at least
In the four centuries of its existence registrar

237
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:38,203
Would you abandon your for a moment? -

Mirror source unknown

00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:37,123
Let

315
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:40,122
2002

316
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:44,121
(Mirror adorn the home (Alan Contact

317
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:46,121
Designer Software

318
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,120
(Husband's (Mary

319
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,119
Father (Timothy) and (Kylie), after two weeks
Of existence, located (Mary), the victim of a severe nervous breakdown

320
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,118
Is then tortured and killed
The home of the family

321
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:58,117
By whom?

322
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,116
At the hands of her husband

323
00:32:02,116 --> 00:32:04,115
According to the police report

324
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:08,115
Her husband was killed
At the hands of his son

325
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:11,114
Before the eyes of her daughter

326
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:19,112
I intend to prove that all the people who reminded them
Are not responsible for their actions

327
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:23,111
Alan Russell) was not fatal)
I've been the victim of

328
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:27,110
One of the many victims
A victim of supernatural forces that static mirror

329
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,109
Why not finish it off
And destroy the dreaded this thing?

330
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:34,107
You really do not remember?

331
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,106
What do I remember?

332
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:43,105
Please shattered ..

333
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:44,105
Prefer

334
00:32:49,104 --> 00:32:50,103
OK

335
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,099
I learned a lot about what
.. Happens to people who can not afford

336
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:11,097
To deal with is terrible

337
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:16,096
The mind creates many protections
To help them to adapt

338
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,095
When rooted belief

339
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:24,094
Mind takes random events
And combines them to support the novel

340
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:32,092
A sleeve issue discussed by
To find 12 or 13 supports your novel?

341
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:35,092
Why put the chair to the ground?

342
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,089
I'm trying to talk with you

343
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,088
Only one person from
Tried to destroy the mirror before

344
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:49,087
(Oliver Jeffries)

345
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:53,086
"In 1971, a professor of the Academy of" Manhattan
Where the suspended mirror hall for lectures

346
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:59,085
One day, I rush towards the mirror fire extinguisher
Flagrant that it should be destroyed, but he did not draw any blow her

347
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:05,083
According to his students, he sat quietly for a minute
Before you head out and walking through cars

348
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,082
Clearly, it is able
To defend itself

349
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:11,082
I Gerdtk of your weapon just

350
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:17,080
Do you know why did not extinguish
Oh mirror (Kylie)?

351
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,079
In addition to the possibility of evicted
Or charged with destruction of property 

352
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:24,078
It is not for me to destroy them

353
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:27,077
No one can
Save you from your illusions

354
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:29,076
You did it yourself

355
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:32,076
Which brings me to the last reserve

356
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:36,075
You look to anchor weighs 20 lbs.

357
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:42,073
In addition to the 20-pound weight rack connected to cable
Is operated automatically by a temporary my kitchen

358
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:45,073
Without the need for electricity, which is something important
We are after 10 seconds

359
00:34:45,073 --> 00:34:47,072
Temporary work every 30 minutes

360
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:49,072
.. If we were not here to stoppable

361
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,070
Here we will put the mirror

362
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,068
What prevents this
Is our survival

363
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:04,067
You see, did not wait too long?

364
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,066
Because we hold the weapon server
Addressed to the head

365
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:10,066
I expect to be willing
To defend itself

366
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:29,028
Taala to my office for a moment

367
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:36,026
I think I was clear
On non-Abzqm my office

368
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:38,026
We do not do

369
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:40,025
I do not like it here

370
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,025
Well, what is this?

371
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:50,023
We did not do it

372
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:52,023
OK

373
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:56,022
Otalman, I can Smaekma night
And ye are playing

374
00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:01,019
I have a child it Votfhm
I know that the transition is difficult

375
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:05,018
But this will not happen again, okay?

376
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:09,017
If You were Tabthan plants Omkma

377
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:11,017
Stopped it too

378
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:17,016
You know uncle indicate dead plants?

379
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:21,015
Problems in the source water
Tank or bad

380
00:38:22,014 --> 00:38:25,014
I remember we were purify water, filter

381
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:30,012
Oliver Jeffries), dead plants in the auditorium)
Tobin) keep plants dead in the bedroom)

382
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:35,010
Park worker could not understand
The reason for the presence of dead plants everywhere

383
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,010
Live plants

384
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:43,008
Live plants in the living room
Live plants, plants alive

385
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:48,007
Those are your rules -
Give it some time -

386
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:50,007
To your knowledge, were not fed on plants only

387
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:52,006
But there was another variable

388
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:54,006
My dog?

389
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,004
Sorry, my dog

390
00:39:07,002 --> 00:39:08,002
Drinking water

391
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,998
Come, my friend -
Come on, (Mason) - zap -

392
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:24,997
Mason), later the stick) -

393
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:25,997
! Later stick

394
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,996
! Come on, go! , Go

395
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:33,995
The only reason for his bullish
Anxiety is that we are not safe

396
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:37,994
I told you I saw a person below -
But this does not makes me feel more secure -

397
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:39,994
Quite the contrary

398
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:48,990
Well, it will be closed, and Avrgh lead
Until an emergency

399
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,989
! O silly cow

400
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:03,987
Bam just called me?

401
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:05,986
I did not say anything

402
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:43,976
! Oh my god

403
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:50,974
! (Alan) -
! I'm working -

404
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,970
From talking with?

405
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,968
Are you going to do something about the dog barking?

406
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:18,967
(There are speeches, my dog ​​(Alan
I have bit me

407
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:20,966

00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:23,965
I'm just fine

409
00:41:27,964 --> 00:41:30,964

Well, 'Listen, I'll go
To play golf with a client

For my office, okay?

413
00:41:56,956 --> 00:41:57,956

00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:01,955
Well, love you both guys

Why do not you get it out? -
My mom said it punishable -

419
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:56,940
Hello, did not Tglsan so? -
We must do something about this dog -

420
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,939
It would be nice if I say hello

421
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:01,939
I've been barking all day long
I had to incarceration in your office

422
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:03,938
Tmonyh

423
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:22,933
Where is it?

424
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:28,931
Here's the problem, you remember wrong -
Do not -

425
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:30,931
I assure you, I remember correctly -
No I'm not well -

426
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:33,930
Ciberd Australian "and the other"
Animals not found them

427
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,929
Do you remember (Mason) in his last days?

428
00:43:36,929 --> 00:43:39,929
Vomiting and accidents all over the house

429
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:42,928
My doctor made me emotional
Looking for fever virus

430
00:43:42,928 --> 00:43:49,926
Fatal disease that causes nausea and aggressive
And urination, but Aradi, which could kill plants

431
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:51,926
Mason) was sick)

432
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,925
Well, I'm taking to the doctor tomorrow

433
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:57,924
Bad news, I think it will not come back to me

434
00:43:57,924 --> 00:43:59,923
Mom, where (Mason)?

435
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:03,922
It is punishable

436
00:44:03,922 --> 00:44:05,921
Are you saying that you remember
Thus it occur?

437
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:06,921
Is this really says?

438
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:07,921
Why not?

439
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:08,921
You're wrong

440
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:12,920
I saw my mother closed the door upon
And sat down in front of the door and did not come out of it

441
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:16,919
Have you heard about the confused memories
In psychology?

442
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:18,918
No, but I think you've heard

443
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:20,918
I read an article about

444
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:23,917
Our brain stores information
Tracers confused

445
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:26,916
The general idea is not
.. Accurate record of what happened

446
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:30,915
This is nonsense -
It is easy to convert it to the memory of the wrong -

447
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:33,915
I have seen my mother is trapped dog
For many times

448
00:44:33,915 --> 00:44:34,913
My goodness, what have they done to you?

449
00:44:34,913 --> 00:44:39,912
But this was before my father prevents us
From entering office

450
00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:40,912
I feel sorry for you

451
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:42,911
Well, what is more likely?

452
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:45,911
You mispronounce remember the anniversary of 11 years?

453
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:47,910
Or the mirror that eat dogs?

454
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:52,909
"Look, that" the dog

455
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:55,908
Give it some time

456
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:00,907
Little time

457
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:09,239
Nothing happens

458
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,323
I can hear you talking with a

459
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:13,903
You know, you're crazy

460
00:45:13,903 --> 00:45:17,902
I'm not crazy
I've heard you talk with someone

461
00:45:17,902 --> 00:45:20,901
Hear did you say
I hear you through the door

462
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:21,901
! Did not recognize

463
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,900
I'm not crazy

464
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,900
You say that the water is contaminated
And that there is a thief?

465
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,899
! You you lose patience

466
00:45:38,897 --> 00:45:39,897
I'm sorry because we Oikznak

467
00:45:41,896 --> 00:45:44,895
Is Ti_ajeryn with dad
Because of the woman in the office?

468
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:51,893
You must remember that woman
I've seen you too

469
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:53,892
I have convinced myself
I saw many things

470
00:45:54,892 --> 00:45:55,892
But what we're seeing really?

471
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:58,891
Mom screaming at Dad
In the middle of the night

472
00:45:58,891 --> 00:46:00,891
Mom says she heard a voice
But probably my father on the phone

473
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,889
What about women
I have seen out of the window?

474
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,889
When Roitea?

475
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:10,888
The first time, and we play in the garden

476
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:12,888
Was safer at home?

477
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:14,887
Mother was always home

478
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:17,886
Are you sure about that?

479
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:18,886
I am not sure

480
00:46:25,136 --> 00:46:27,219
Damn -
Damn -

481
00:46:27,883 --> 00:46:28,883
! Recessive! , Retrograde

482
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:36,881
've Been staying affair
It was a failed marriage, see how he ended

483
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:37,881
No

484
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,880
Our father was a traitor
This has made it safer to lose her senses

485
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,879
Stop -
Go haywire and kill her, and he'll kill us as well -

486
00:46:43,879 --> 00:46:44,879
Really, a failed marriage

487
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:47,878
This explains how she lost her teeth
Her hair and her senses before you die

488
00:46:47,878 --> 00:46:52,877
And yes, a failed marriage, this explains
People who saw them in the house

489
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:55,876
It was inclosed, discreet
All signs of an affair

490
00:46:55,876 --> 00:47:03,873
I have looked at all their belongings, and while washing your brain
I did not find any evidence of any relationship

491
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:04,873
So intelligent that it does not leave impact

492
00:47:04,873 --> 00:47:05,873
! Hist

493
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:08,872
I have spoken with friends and colleagues
If there was a woman are like a ghost

494
00:47:08,872 --> 00:47:12,871
And yes, I agree with you, I've had inclosed and discreet
All signs of a relationship, Well

495
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,870
I'm not saying it has not been seduced though

496
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,870
Question Why seduced

497
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:25,868
There have been things
We bicker, you know?

498
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:28,867
Did you know that the temperature
Increased three degrees?

499
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:29,867
Three degrees

500
00:47:29,867 --> 00:47:32,866
Two people in a tight space
Lights and Consumer Electronics

501
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:34,866
And probably phones no longer work
Did not materialize?

502
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:36,864
Well, let's look

503
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:39,864
Dial tone

504
00:47:39,864 --> 00:47:40,863
Heat?

505
00:47:40,863 --> 00:47:44,862
Kiley), you can overcome this)
I did it

506
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,862
You want save the family name?
You do not have to do for our parents

507
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:51,861
But you did it to yourself

508
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:55,860
I Dmarwk in that place, is not it?

509
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,859
I was very natural when I went

510
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:02,858
It was necessary to destroy you in order to graduate

511
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:05,857
! And (Mason), stop the dreaded Nbag

512
00:48:05,857 --> 00:48:07,857
! You know! , You have finished

513
00:48:07,857 --> 00:48:09,856
I want to help you to overcome this

514
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:11,855
But I will not stand
And let you dog Tazben

515
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,854
What do you do? -
Hear Nbaha -

516
00:48:13,854 --> 00:48:16,854
! Stop, stop this

517
00:48:22,852 --> 00:48:24,852
! No. No, wait

518
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:27,851
Why?

519
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:30,850
You do not know what to do -
Oh do not even know (Kylie), you're sick -

520
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,850
Did not happen anything
I said that it will happen

521
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,849
The plants are still alive, still mirror mirror
The only danger is you on the dog

522
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:41,848
This is not your fault

523
00:48:42,848 --> 00:48:44,847
It also was not my fault

524
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:47,845
I've had the help of
And you're on your own

525
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:51,844
Difficult to overcome these difficulties
But it does not call for shame

526
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:54,844
They inherited in our family

527
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,841
Kiley), I'm sorry)

528
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,840
Listen ..

529
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,839
Let's get out of here

530
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:17,838
Let's go to another place
And continue talking about our lives

531
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,832
Where are we going?

532
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:41,831
... (Kylie)

533
00:49:41,832 --> 00:49:42,874
Where?

534
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:47,830
Let's turn off the Alcamert
Dismantle those Anchor

535
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,829
Then we can go
Anywhere Tredenh

536
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:56,828
Maybe talk with your fiance

537
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:58,827
Would want to help
You know that

538
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,819
Kylie)?)

539
00:50:31,818 --> 00:50:34,817
Here is

540
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:38,815
Here is a

541
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:06,809
! Yes

542
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:09,808
! Yes! . Yes

543
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:11,807
! Yes! . Yes

544
00:51:21,804 --> 00:51:24,803
I was reviewing the tape
For the last three minutes

545
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:28,802
I've had a relationship, I've had a failed marriage "
Look at how he ended

546
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:32,801
Our father was a traitor
Safer than lose my senses

547
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:35,801
Go haywire and kill her -
Yes, a failed marriage -

548
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,800
This explains how she lost her teeth
Her hair and her senses before you die

549
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,799
And yes, a failed marriage, this explains
"People who saw them in the house

550
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:46,798
I do not remember doing this, remember?

551
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:50,796
Do not remember, and the heat may increase two degrees
Leading to the firing warning

Telephone

553
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:55,795
He began to move -
Telephone -

554
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:58,794
Which indicates that the dog
Born enough energy to succeed as bait

555
00:51:58,794 --> 00:51:59,794
Contact your doctor

556

You did it outside the range of impact

Otherwise you will not know from talking with really

558

Hello, yes, everything is fine

I'm sorry about earlier
Speak to you after an hour

Possibility that it is really
Fifty percent

562
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:27,786
We left that room for a period of

563
00:52:28,786 --> 00:52:31,785
I think that the dog was helpful
More than I thought

564
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:40,783
It seems that the extent of their impact

565
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,783
About 30 feet

566
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:46,782
This means that our kitchen
Laundry room, garage

567

You can both stay here

636
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:48,604
And play video games

637
01:03:49,603 --> 01:03:52,602

Food -
It is on my list -

TV does not work

651

What did you say, my princess?

'll Tell her that the food carried

656

But ... my father said -
I do not care what he said -

657
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:04,519
Mom?

658
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:42,509
They need a doctor

659

660
01:09:47,507 --> 01:09:52,505
I have commanded you not to go to her room
Not disobey my orders, why?

661
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:56,504
I've disobeyed my orders
So you punish

662
01:09:57,504 --> 01:10:02,503
You and your brother were banned
From out of the house

What the doctor said?

667
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:24,497
Mark that my father spoke to him

668
01:10:27,496 --> 01:10:30,495
Like the previous doctor?

669
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,494
Exactly like the previous doctor

670
01:10:36,494 --> 01:10:38,493
The same sound

671
01:11:01,488 --> 01:11:03,486
Hello, Dad

For misconduct

This would be nothing

Something unexpected

When is the last time seized a temporary anchor? -
Do not -

717
01:18:38,364 --> 01:18:41,364
The court plan
We do not have to do anything

718
01:18:41,364 --> 01:18:44,363
All we have to do to stay here and wait
Not more than half an hour

Will enable us to stay here
And watch this thing die

723
01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:19,353
It is a trick to make us go back to the inside

724
01:19:19,353 --> 01:19:21,353
Or this trick
To keep us there

Order it again -

"Yes, I've just contacted," Hathurn 2705 -

01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:02,342
We can not do anything

731
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,340
Just wait -
We see ourselves die -

732
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:10,339
We will have to be
Very brave

733
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:52,328
I've looked for a mirror
Then remove the gun

734
01:20:57,327 --> 01:20:59,326
We'll have to destroy

735
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:29,318

They only hurt us below

742
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,279
We have taken the right decision abroad
They are trying to keep us away

743
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:59,278
We have to go down
Before working Anchor

We'll have to run down

751
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:02,261
What would you do? -
Do not worry in this regard, just run -
