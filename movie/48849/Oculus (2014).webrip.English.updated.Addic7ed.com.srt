1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,024
Kaylie!

2
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:02,933
Shhh!

3
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,046
I fired

4
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,917
As many times 
I've had this dream..

5
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,954
It's never
been me before.

6
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,999
Holding a gun.

7
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:34,830
I know.

8
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,065
It's very good.

9
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:44,875
It implies true deeply rude
acceptance of responsibility.

10
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:47,072
And it tells me that you
haven't only overcome your delusions

11
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:48,843
in your conscious mind,

12
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,009
but in his subconscious
mind as well.

13
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:56,990
It's my opinion. That he was not
danger to himself or others.

14
00:01:57,023 --> 00:02:00,925
And I believe he should be
discharged as the step requested

15
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,828
on his upcoming 21st birthday.

16
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:21,012
Sold to the gentleman.
Congratulations to you, sir.

17
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:26,919
Alright, and our next item,
is a gorgeous antique mirror,

18
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:28,944
recovered from the state.

19
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:38,830
A mirror has a history
length when the war broke out.

20
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,993
This is the original glass
and the original frame.

21
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:47,804
Glass is in excellent condition
unless there was some damage down there.

22
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:51,038
One part that happens
of the black past.

23
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:55,104
And we will start
auction starting at $ 10,000.

24
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:56,912
Do I have 10? And
it is over here in front.

25
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:59,850
- Thank you, sir.
- Sister you talk about your progress.

26
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,912
The message tells me about
give me a job.

27
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,925
It would be very unusual
for your transmission.

28
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,087
We've got 12,000 on the line.
We returned to the room.

29
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,993
Does he know I
come with you?

30
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,088
For more fun.

31
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:13,925
No. No thank you.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,991
I'm going to see him alone.

33
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,031
- We bargain now.
- Of course.

34
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,063
Do you remember what
are we talking about?

35
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:25,911
You have the auxiliary system
make you better.

36
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:28,847
Tim, we should be able to
release it by itself.

37
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:31,884
We recommend that you do not go with
your sister first.

38
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:36,013
But what is most important,
you protect your healing.

39
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:42,988
- 16,000.
- 16,000, that he was 16.

40
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,861
16, two times..

41
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:48,866
- Sold! Please have a work of art
terrific. - Good.

42
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,817
Please wait a moment.

43
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,941
Hey, little brother.

44
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:42,987
You happiest day.

45
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:46,982
Oh, the apartements..

46
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:50,861
So I have been studying your data, and you
was in trying to join the citizens.

47
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:53,832
So I scored
some interesting things.

48
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,028
And while you may
search for what you like.

49
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:58,969
We've got a lot of class to it.

50
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,941
Kaylie, I do not know how
how to thank you.

51
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:05,001
Well, I myself can not wait
to tell you.

52
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:09,905
Suddenly they do not
let me see you.

53
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:17,049
It was not.. It is not you
should not see me.

54
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:22,022
I just.. I just have a few
thing I need to finish alone.

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,991
Then okay.

56
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:35,830
I was the only family that is important
is able to see you now.

57
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:38,943
Hey!

58
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,883
I was not dead.

59
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:51,888
What do you mean?

60
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,950
You know.. Last
Next time I see you.

61
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,986
I tried to do that.

62
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,827
People disappeared in the ocean.

63
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,060
There is a story in
the missing part.

64
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:05,037
It took one and a half years
for I can do that.

65
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:08,097
The best of it is you
only has a few days.

66
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:10,838
Should be enough.

67
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,880
Kaylie few days for what?

68
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,949
To keep our promises?

69
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,078
I'm relying on it.

70
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,998
Okay, the sofa can put it there.

71
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,092
And the bathroom near the kitchen.

72
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,898
Hey do not do it first.

73
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:44,033
Yes, I immediately get the data I I
will govern what will happen, yes.

74
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:46,102
Can I call you back later?

75
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:51,974
Jack! I'm sorry, I do not have time
call, I'm very busy at all..

76
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,986
How does your state?

77
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,852
Tell him he was arrested.

78
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,015
He was not even part of this.

79
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:58,981
Shoot you from behind!

80
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:01,858
- Oh, you were so dead!
- Wait, wait, honey?

81
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:02,919
- Not.
- What?

82
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:04,020
Inside this room?

83
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,895
Into the room.

84
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,059
- Well..
- Be careful with the top..

85
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:11,903
It was really very special.

86
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,004
Hey, everybody!
What did I just say?

87
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,067
- But the mother?
- You must be unpacked his boxes.

88
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,008
Alright.

89
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:19,979
Em, yes, no, talk to me.

90
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,981
- Okay.
- Thank you.

91
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,073
Okay.

92
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,948
I'll leave.

93
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:28,013
Surely I'll be right back.

94
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:30,079
I do not know if I
need a table here.

95
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:32,023
Good, you will tell
I, or simply be..

96
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,049
just be quiet?

97
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:43,860
Or, I'm hoping
for three delicious cake..

98
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:47,964
In this small room torture,
If it be?

99
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,879
I get it, okay, I'll
prepare whatever you want.

100
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:55,881
- Thank you.
- Hmm-mmm..

101
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:58,041
It was an achievement, is not it?

102
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:03,954
I'm confused. Because if you want to save
antiques, and I've been so so..

103
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,051
Yes, I will only buy what is good
to this place instead of being a shop.

104
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:09,995
I am giving
Your new home.

105
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,055
The new party, and
with a new heart.

106
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,035
- You like it?
- And forever?

107
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:20,099
Oh, dear as long as I can..

108
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:24,968
I did not make you ugly.

109
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,880
Are you sure about this? Because
I think you could be with.

110
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,925
Yes. I think it's the best.

111
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,962
My office alone.

112
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:54,906
You promised me you would never
forget what actually happened.

113
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,000
You promised.

114
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,936
I was once 10 years old.

115
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:07,078
Well, I'll go tomorrow night.
And..

116
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:09,953
I really need your help.

117
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,088
Night, Timmy.

118
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:48,918
I finally found a scar
from a few years ago.

119
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:52,092
Let me see it
with professionally.

120
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,901
What scar?

121
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:59,867
I know what you've done.

122
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:03,103
- So? - You have to make
together again.

123
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,944
It was not easy.

124
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,974
Oh, God!

125
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:02,884
Hey you it's okay.

126
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:05,118
What's wrong?

127
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,823
Calm down.

128
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:11,056
Relax, I'm here.

129
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,939
That's all right.

130
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,992
- Hey.
- Hey.

131
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:52,869
Sorry, are you busy?

132
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,896
I want to discuss
on this network.

133
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:58,001
- Okay.
- It look..

134
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,877
What do you think?

135
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:05,976
I get this
from your computer.

136
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:15,089
I do not mean
surprise you.

137
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:18,062
Yes, it's okay.

138
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:20,031
I do not know what to say.

139
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,057
I'm the same.

140
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:27,836
Okay okay, I'll
be honest with you.

141
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:41,113
I do not need you
said nothing.

142
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:46,018
I know all
you want to say.

143
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:53,864
I do not expect you to understand
it's part of my life.

144
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:58,927
It would be hard to understand.

145
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,939
I understand.

146
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,837
Okay.

147
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,941
I usually do not get
Such shipment.

148
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:15,044
Oh yes, I also never
seen anything like this.

149
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:17,818
- It may valuables.
- I understand.

150
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:18,983
I'll open it myself.

151
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,891
See what's inside.

152
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:25,963
Please just, all yours.

153
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:53,091
It again.

154
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,860
You must be hungry.

155
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,043
Well, it's broken.

156
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:45,865
Hey you..

157
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,065
Are you okay?

158
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,044
I was shocked.

159
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,882
You seem to have a problem.

160
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:00,010
Ok, fine.

161
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:14,900
We will meet again in the home.

162
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:18,902
You put it wrote there.

163
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:21,066
- Hello.
- Hey.

164
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,938
- Are you busy?
- Not.

165
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:24,067
I need you to sign here.

166
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,079
I have a feeling
which is not bad overnight.

167
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,006
We need to talk about this.

168
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:31,881
Of course, I'll be there.

169
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,851
All right, I'll wait.

170
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:36,913
No, in my house.

171
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,086
I think, I have not told you.

172
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:19,825
I do not know, maybe
now you already know, right?

173
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:20,991
Okay.

174
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,897
Goodbye.

175
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:13,045
Oh shit.

176
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:20,854
You still did not answer.

177
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:22,918
Oh my God, I have not
ready for all this.

178
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:25,021
I'm not the only one
children in my class.

179
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:27,032
It was very unfortunate.

180
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,830
That's not nothing, Marie.

181
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:35,034
I almost believe you.

182
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:37,838
You are my beloved child.

183
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:40,937
Well, I wish I could eat pineapple.

184
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,077
I could have been there
replace your father.

185
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,823
- Hey well.
- It's okay, I'm Marie.

186
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:55,952
What's wrong with this father's day job?

187
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:57,895
Yes.

188
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,932
Who is the woman who is no
at the office today?

189
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,965
Not anyone.

190
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:06,937
I do not believe.

191
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,906
She is beautiful.

192
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,071
I do not know.

193
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,870
The place is small.

194
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:40,930
Come on, dog.

195
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:43,031
You named your dog, dog?

196
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:46,044
I ran out of names.

197
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:48,106
Are you okay?

198
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:52,006
You look silent.

199
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:55,848
You can relax here.

200
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:01,083
Do you want to top?

201
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:10,994
It was already in the
house, since the beginning.

202
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,998
That's what often occurs in adolescents.

203
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,960
I am a person who is not one of his
many associate while in school.

204
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:23,031
I hope you do not experience it.

205
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,036
You know, at the start of his.

206
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:29,972
So are you ready to find out?

207
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:42,918
How can you
find this thing?

208
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:46,863
You know, trying to, this will
be better for both of us.

209
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,057
Put it over here.

210
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:25,027
What is it?

211
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,996
One of the defense, not dangerous.

212
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,804
So, umm..

213
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:35,903
Umh, I had to make sure we are safe.

214
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:37,813
I'm better prepared.

215
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:45,082
I see you're ready.

216
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:00,061
Well..

217
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:05,969
My name is Kaylie Russell, My age 23
years, I along with my brother Tim Russell,

218
00:25:05,978 --> 00:25:07,969
His name was given
follow our father's name.

219
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:15,110
He was 21 years old, now
hours of 4:14 pm on October 13th

220
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,089
And we were in 2705 hussel Grand.

221
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:22,890
I'll start by detailing the action
pencegahanku mirror before I reveal it.

222
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:25,829
There are three cameras, each
with independent power circuits.

223
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,061
With his technology, he could
shows the objective weather.

224
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,001
In addition, I always
My phone alerting,

225
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:33,903
And now I will
asked my sister phone,

226
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:36,965
so that I can control
all types of communication.

227
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:44,980
It's weird, you know.

228
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:46,976
Follow it.

229
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:53,990
The alarm goes off every 45 minutes,
reminding us to examine all precautions.

230
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:56,961
The alarm goes off every 3 hours
to remind us to eat.

231
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:59,863
And we've menyiadakan preparation
food and beverages to prevent dehydration.

232
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,092
And her other,

233
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:04,938
Each room is fitted with the
regulator temperature with

234
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,033
automatic temperature change
like the one in the hospital.

235
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,841
If there is a greater change
of 5 degrees, he will perform his duties.

236
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:16,912
Temperature can also extrem
be very dangerous.

237
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,016
So..

238
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:23,885
The purpose of today's experiment,
is to prove that this glass,

239
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:27,085
is home to the power
unexpected supernatural.

240
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:29,411
Because evidence suggests
that the presence

241
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:30,987
of some object that holds
the power of evil,

242
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:33,436
And it is responsible
for at least 45 of its

243
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:35,899
cases that occurred in the
last several decades.

244
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:37,960
- Would you stop for a while.
- Do not.

245
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,870
Do not, do not touch his camera.

246
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,929
Sorry.

247
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:52,883
Case I get is
of cases is unknown.

248
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:56,081
Forgotten by history, deliberately
done by some people.

249
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,989
In the year 1754..

250
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:04,930
Saul Blaster, 17-year-old boy
found hanging in the fireplace.

251
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:06,922
Another precaution.

252
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:13,998
Hello, I just look at you,
like you asked.

253
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:19,842
I'm not fine, I'm just
need a few more hours.

254
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,980
Uh.. of course.

255
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:25,814
I'll call you after
a few minutes, I love you.

256
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:30,079
I just picked up the phone
from my fiance, Michael Dumont.

257
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:33,080
I told him I fret
spending time with my brother,

258
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,889
and provide instruction on its
to contact the authorities,

259
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:38,020
- If I do not pick up the phone.
- I'm still here.

260
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:39,894
Nothing personal.

261
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:44,025
So in 1755, the case
which is almost the same place.

262
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:46,003
It's just that he hanged
on his porch.

263
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:49,007
Well, the equation in addition
to the way they die is,

264
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,999
they both have the same
mirrors that we have here.

265
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,399
To demonstrate the
seriousness of this case, I

266
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,811
will show a warrant to
a search of his home.

267
00:27:56,848 --> 00:28:01,080
Because the case does not go unsolved,
so the case was closed in 1784.

268
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:06,915
But then a similar case occurred
more on this guy, Howard Glancy, 1864.

269
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:10,045
This guy has a weight of
300 pounds, when compared

270
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:13,089
to today's equivalent the
weight of the baby whale.

271
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:16,090
She has a dance hall in Atlanta.

272
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:20,868
And look what I got, this is
collage of newspaper at the time.

273
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,965
Well, the weight is reduced very much.

274
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,909
And then he found 3 weeks
then, without a clear cause of death.

275
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:29,948
Unfortunately, he and
his family wanted to

276
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,975
destroy The mirror before
her death in 1885.

277
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:35,953
And after that, the mirror was missing.

278
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:38,854
No one knows where the loss.

279
00:28:38,857 --> 00:28:41,883
And the latter case is
Mariana woman Bore,

280
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:43,918
He loved to spend
Her time in the bathroom.

281
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:47,125
He was found after three weeks
dead in the bathtub.

282
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:52,930
Well, the coroner's report states
the cause of death was dehydration.

283
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,940
The woman died from thirst for three days.

284
00:28:56,942 --> 00:29:01,072
The next case is the death of the
occurs in a woman Olive Vanza.

285
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:04,879
Neighbors found him dead in
in the garden of his own house.

286
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,043
This picture was taken at
the time of his death.

287
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:11,340
Olive Husband found here,
while he and his son are

288
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:14,850
found in conditions severe
in the master bedroom.

289
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,886
Head and the bottom
separate body when found.

290
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:20,930
So also with her children.

291
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:22,923
While other parts of the body
not at all hurt.

292
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:24,830
Absolutely no.

293
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:26,061
Like nothing happened.

294
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:30,965
I will continue with other cases
happened to a girl on a farm.

295
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,843
He never recovered from his injuries, and
The farm has several dogs.

296
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:37,872
Including Shepard dog
Australia is still small.

297
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,019
Let's eat.

298
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:59,003
To whom did you make this video?

299
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:04,842
Everyone who was there.

300
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:06,001
Why?

301
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:08,809
Because children oppressors will know?

302
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:11,982
And you're afraid they'll leave you alone.

303
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:14,918
Because taking care of the problem mirrors.

304
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:18,956
Listen, Kaylie, we are just a small child.

305
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:24,862
It was just a scary story of the past, and
we do not need to seek the truth, she did.

306
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,831
He is a crazy guy
who tortured and killed.

307
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,105
Call me crazy they pleased you.

308
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:41,945
But you should not be talking
about him like that.

309
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:48,079
Shawn Cath, 1955, was
found dead in his bed.

310
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,054
And until now his death
remains a mystery.

311
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:53,024
And in '65, happen again.

312
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:56,027
Someone stated there
's wrong with this mirror.

313
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:59,861
Local officials declared him missing
after not heard the news from her.

314
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:01,833
And he found like this.

315
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,006
And in this case there are
witnesses who say see

316
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:07,936
the big black shadow into
the his room in Paris.

317
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:11,966
Evidence is found
and a small plastic bag of bloody pliers.

318
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,942
In 2002,

319
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:15,105
You can not distinguish the difference
between ilusinasi and Coronation.

320
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:16,876
I know the difference, thank you.

321
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:19,941
Well, I would say
if it's really weird.

322
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:23,045
Your grandfather say attack
heart while getting hit by a car.

323
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:25,852
And our cats escape.

324
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:27,859
How does it make sense to you?

325
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:29,053
Can I re-do this now?

326
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:31,829
Sure, let's do it, Kaylie.

327
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,055
Let's talk about why you're here.

328
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:36,993
Come on.

329
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:40,062
, 2002.

330
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:43,939
Last mirror holder is Alan Russell.

331
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:45,872
Awkward, is not it?

332
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:47,842
Husband to Marie.

333
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,011
Charged with murder
by reason of mental disorder,

334
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,954
and the torture and murder
in the family home.

335
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:57,977
I know.

336
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,853
By her husband.

337
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:04,027
That being said the police report.

338
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:07,896
And her husband was killed by his own son.

339
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:10,934
Right in front of the eyes of her daughter.

340
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:18,906
I just wanted to state that none of the
The people responsible for it,

341
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:22,847
Alan Russell is not a
perpetrator but a victim.

342
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:26,840
And he is the victim of force
supernatural that is in the mirror.

343
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:29,911
So why do not you
Just destroy the damn thing?

344
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,015
You do not remember it?

345
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:39,858
Considering what?

346
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:42,900
Please lah.. destroyed.

347
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:43,992
By all means.

348
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,907
Alright.

349
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:08,017
You know what happens to people
people are trying to destroy it.

350
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,121
And incidentally it matter
it happened to them.

351
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:15,991
The mind makes all kinds
beliefs on everyone.

352
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,904
And when it started pervasive belief,

353
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:23,840
mind takes information
randomized to strengthen it.

354
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:32,073
How many thousands of records that
you combine to support your case?

355
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,819
Why did not you destroy it?

356
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:43,861
- Because I'm trying to talk to you.
- Ah..

357
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:47,093
And I know one person who
trying to destroy the mirror.

358
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:48,963
Oliver Jackrice.

359
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:53,063
1891, a teacher who gives
teaching at the Academy of Manhattan.

360
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:55,977
He tried to destroy these
mirrors was in the

361
00:33:55,989 --> 00:33:58,907
hall, but was never
able to destroy her

362
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:04,904
According to the report, after which he
walked out the hall and died in the crash.

363
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,876
No one is able to destroy the mirror.

364
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:10,887
Just like the others.

365
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,825
You know why I do not
smash the mirror?

366
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:21,054
In addition you get fired or..
trial for damaging property.

367
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:23,934
That's not my right.

368
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,028
Nothing can ruin
delusion it for you.

369
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,033
You have to do it yourself.

370
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:31,999
This is my way to do it.

371
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:35,911
You're looking at 25
pounds of a sharp knife.

372
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,872
Plus 25 pounds of ballast
which is connected with

373
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:41,853
a modified automatic cable
with a kitchen timer.

374
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:44,980
Now timeliness is important,
and we got about 10 seconds longer.

375
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,048
Its timer runs every 30 minutes,

376
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,026
and if you do not stop,

377
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,898
be like that.

378
00:34:56,935 --> 00:35:00,962
And if you do not want that to happen
again, we have to continue this.

379
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,001
You know how it was?

380
00:35:04,843 --> 00:35:06,970
I guess it's like
gun pointed at your head.

381
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,878
And I expect it to make us more
desire to solve this case.

382
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,081
Hey, kids, come to my office for a while.

383
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,926
I think I've been pretty clear about
you should not be all sorts in here.

384
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:37,890
We did not.

385
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,988
I do not like in here.

386
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:42,963
All right, then what is?

387
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,904
We did not do that.

388
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:52,069
Ok, I trust you.

389
00:37:52,076 --> 00:37:55,910
You know I can hear
if you all sorts here.

390
00:37:57,048 --> 00:38:00,984
All children want to do, I
understand, I know this move is difficult.

391
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:04,945
It will not happen, ok?

392
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:08,924
If you all kinds that would be a problem.

393
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:10,895
You also have to remember that.

394
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:16,990
You know what dad's plan for me?

395
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:20,869
Saving water supply in the tank.

396
00:38:22,073 --> 00:38:24,871
I seem to remember ever drank.

397
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:29,870
All that is said in front of the classroom,
about what is happening in the room.

398
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:34,818
Where there is a dead cat everywhere.

399
00:38:35,887 --> 00:38:36,911
Plan wise.

400
00:38:38,823 --> 00:38:42,953
Plan started in the living room,
live plants, plants that have a life.

401
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:47,898
- You look cute by the way.
- Come on, do not mess continues.

402
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,900
We must be serious.

403
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:51,899
I was also involved in this.

404
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:53,826
Dog?

405
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,839
Sorry, Dog.

406
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,010
Mineral water.

407
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,922
- Come on, boy, come on Mason, go.
- Go!

408
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,867
- Mason, ran!
- Wake up!

409
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:26,028
Go get it!

410
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,935
Come on, wake up!

411
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:31,976
You know the main
reason I bought this is

412
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,967
because you are frightened
and feel insecure.

413
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:35,883
Because you told me to
see someone at the bottom.

414
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,812
But it makes me feel safer.

415
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,916
On the contrary, in fact..

416
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:44,943
Ok, I will save and lock it,
perlurunya unload, until

417
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:48,857
I'm sure a time will be
required at times of emergency.

418
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,964
Go to hell!

419
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,807
What did you just say to me?

420
00:40:05,043 --> 00:40:06,067
I did not say anything.

421
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:42,846
Ah..

422
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:44,006
Oh my God!

423
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:50,851
- Alan!
- I'm working!

424
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:05,832
With whom did you speak?

425
00:41:11,943 --> 00:41:14,002
When are you going to do something
the damn dog?

426
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:19,109
There is something wrong with
The dog, Alan, he bit me!

427
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:21,051
Are you okay?

428
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:23,945
I'm fine.

429
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:30,953
You seem like lost in
own world in here.

430
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:32,860
I was not lost in the..

431
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:49,967
Children? Listen, you
have to I provide special

432
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:52,914
assistance This day, I have
an appointment with a client.

433
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,977
I will need you to
far away from my office, ok?

434
00:41:56,988 --> 00:41:58,012
Ok, dad.

435
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:01,922
Well, I love you guys.

436
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:22,980
You want to come in?

437
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:25,109
Go and see what's inside.

438
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:39,084
Damn..

439
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:48,970
Why we should not get in?
There must be something inside.

440
00:42:51,976 --> 00:42:56,845
- Hey, kids, why do you.. - We must
do something about the damn dogs.

441
00:42:57,048 --> 00:42:58,913
Well, a hello would be nice.

442
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,976
He was barking all day, I
should be locked in the office.

443
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:03,945
Reassure him.

444
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:22,995
Where is he?

445
00:43:25,943 --> 00:43:28,912
- Well, that's just it, you
one to remember. - Not.

446
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:30,881
- I'm not one to remember.
- You're wrong..

447
00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:34,078
I still remember it
well, I can not be wrong.

448
00:43:34,118 --> 00:43:36,985
- Maybe you. - Do you
Mason remembered until the end?

449
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:39,919
Munta throwing around the house.

450
00:43:40,992 --> 00:43:43,017
I've merisetnya and
was due to a virus.

451
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,501
- Oh my God. - The virus
that causes nausea-

452
00:43:46,513 --> 00:43:49,966
nausea and eventually
kills the plant.

453
00:43:50,101 --> 00:43:51,898
Mason illness.

454
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,929
All right, I'll take him
to the doctor tomorrow.

455
00:43:55,072 --> 00:43:57,905
Bad news, I think we
both will not be back.

456
00:43:57,942 --> 00:43:59,842
Mom, where Mason?

457
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,842
Ah, he is punished.

458
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:05,906
Are you sure remember it like it was?

459
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,042
Did you really say that?

460
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:08,016
Why not?

461
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:09,008
You are wrong.

462
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:11,072
I saw the mother put it
in office, and I sat

463
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:13,114
in front of him all day
and no one in or out.

464
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:16,926
Have you ever studied human psychology?

465
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:18,861
No, I never heard of it.

466
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:20,888
I once read an article about it.

467
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:24,090
Our brain is actually a
code that captures and tracks.

468
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:26,899
More like, the ability
in receiving information..

469
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:30,863
- This is bullshit.
- And save it to memory.

470
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:33,875
You see the mother enter the dog
us into the office a few times.

471
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:34,969
Oh my God, what are they doing to you.

472
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:37,385
Long before the father
forbid entry to anyone in

473
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:39,814
the office, there are
traces of it in your mind.

474
00:44:39,884 --> 00:44:40,873
I feel sorry for you.

475
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:43,011
Ok, more like what exactly?

476
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,884
Remember something that you're wrong
which occurred eleven years ago?

477
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:47,856
Or about our dogs?

478
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:52,929
Oh look, it's Dog.

479
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:55,929
It's almost time.

480
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:00,963
Time is short.

481
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:13,975
You're late, you're not okay?

482
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:17,852
I'm not lying, I hear you
talk to someone.

483
00:45:17,888 --> 00:45:20,857
Do you hear yourself,
I can hear you through the door?

484
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:22,086
Admit it!

485
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:23,957
I'm not crazy.

486
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:27,088
Then why are you fears, and
said there was a thief?

487
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:28,894
You've lost your senses!

488
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:33,798
Children.

489
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:39,968
I'm sorry I woke you.

490
00:45:41,846 --> 00:45:45,077
Why do you continue to fight?

491
00:45:48,919 --> 00:45:51,786
You know how the state
mother, you can see it.

492
00:45:51,922 --> 00:45:53,913
I convinced myself I own
if I melhat many things.

493
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:55,985
But what do we see?

494
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:58,861
Mother yelling at dad in
the middle of the night?

495
00:45:58,896 --> 00:46:01,057
Mom says she heard
a voice from inside the office.

496
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:06,960
As I explain to myself I
itself, it is the sound of a window.

497
00:46:07,004 --> 00:46:08,096
Why did you meet him?

498
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:11,065
First of all, we played in the park.

499
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:12,838
Does mother know?

500
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:15,105
Dad was always there at home.

501
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,877
Are you sure about that?

502
00:46:18,048 --> 00:46:19,072
Because, I do not.

503
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:29,018
Quick, get out!

504
00:46:33,097 --> 00:46:36,999
He had an affair, it is a wedding
bad, see how it ends.

505
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:37,968
No.

506
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,835
Our father was a carpenter
mother cheating and it makes us mad.

507
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:43,840
- Stop it. - He is not a person
holy as you remember.

508
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:44,933
Bad marriage.

509
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:48,035
Our mother is a good mother.

510
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:50,563
Shit..

511
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:53,072
A marriage bad, we both see what
occur in the home that night.

512
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,881
She has a secret, a sign
of an illicit relationship.

513
00:46:55,886 --> 00:47:03,816
Dad never showed signs of
if he had illicit relations.

514
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:05,055
He's smart and does not leave a trace.

515
00:47:05,095 --> 00:47:06,062
Silence!

516
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:09,092
And he saw a
another woman, she's a ghost.

517
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:12,864
And yes I agree, it's strange and
many secrets. I'll find it.

518
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:15,963
I'll find him,
she is not like her!

519
00:47:15,973 --> 00:47:18,874
What has happened to him?

520
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,947
I guess you do not understand what
we are debating.

521
00:47:25,983 --> 00:47:28,850
Do you know the temperature
decreased by 3 degrees here?

522
00:47:28,853 --> 00:47:29,945
3 degrees.

523
00:47:29,987 --> 00:47:32,854
In this small room, it bisasa
happens if there is electrical shorting.

524
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:34,916
Then why do not you just check it?

525
00:47:34,925 --> 00:47:37,086
Okay, will check.

526
00:47:38,028 --> 00:47:39,928
Is there anyone at home?

527
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,019
Nothing.

528
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:44,967
You can deal with this, I can.

529
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:47,970
Do you want to overcome this,
Do not betritahukan father and mother.

530
00:47:47,972 --> 00:47:51,806
You're doing this for yourself.

531
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:56,104
Is not it a relief for you?

532
00:47:56,113 --> 00:47:59,844
You are a person who
does not have feelings.

533
00:47:59,984 --> 00:48:02,953
I have to go back, go.

534
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:06,112
Shut up you basic, stupid dog!

535
00:48:06,123 --> 00:48:07,886
Stop it! I'm done!

536
00:48:07,892 --> 00:48:09,985
I know this house like you too.

537
00:48:10,027 --> 00:48:12,052
I'm not going to say anything because
you torture a dog!

538
00:48:12,062 --> 00:48:13,825
- Stop it!
- I'm going to release it.

539
00:48:13,864 --> 00:48:16,799
Stop it, stop it!

540
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:24,898
No, no, wait!

541
00:48:26,844 --> 00:48:28,106
What?

542
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:31,106
- You do not know what you're doing.
- Oh, Kelly, you're sick!

543
00:48:31,115 --> 00:48:33,811
Nothing happened,
What you do not realize it?

544
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:37,912
The dog was still alive, the glass was not
pick it up. You're just imagining it!

545
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,085
And it's not your fault.

546
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:45,020
You're just scared.

547
00:48:45,029 --> 00:48:48,055
I assisted and you're just alone.

548
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:52,034
This is not something
that should be avoided.

549
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,100
It is in our family.

550
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,907
Kaylie, I'm sorry.

551
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:10,019
Listen...

552
00:49:10,888 --> 00:49:13,015
let's get out of here.

553
00:49:13,023 --> 00:49:17,892
Go somewhere else and talk about it.

554
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,915
Where should we go?

555
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,950
Oh, Kaylie...

556
00:49:44,054 --> 00:49:47,888
Let's go to a place
to calm yourself.

557
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:50,883
Where no one will disturb.

558
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:56,866
We will overcome them.

559
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:59,097
There must be people who will help you.

560
00:50:26,864 --> 00:50:28,923
Kaylie?

561
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:34,895
Finally...

562
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,967
Finally.

563
00:51:05,102 --> 00:51:07,093
Yes!

564
00:51:07,104 --> 00:51:12,070
Yes, yes!

565
00:51:21,919 --> 00:51:24,945
And what would you say again?

566
00:51:24,988 --> 00:51:28,924
He had an affair, that's
what actually happened.

567
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:32,895
And you believe all
crazy things he says.

568
00:51:32,896 --> 00:51:36,059
- You are my son.
- Yes, and I would never do that.

569
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,864
I never doubted it.

570
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:43,067
Yes, he can not be trusted,
but how can you like it?

571
00:51:43,073 --> 00:51:46,804
Do you believe it now, is not it?

572
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:51,074
Great, now we'll keep an eye on
temperature changes occur.

573
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:53,072
We'll find him.

574
00:51:53,117 --> 00:51:55,847
We never learn in school.

575
00:51:55,853 --> 00:51:58,845
We must gather enough evidence.

576
00:51:58,889 --> 00:51:59,947
Do not do this.

577
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,949
Team, we talked about this.

578
00:52:03,961 --> 00:52:07,795
I know this is difficult for you to do.

579
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:12,991
Hello?

580
00:52:13,003 --> 00:52:16,837
Hi, yes. I'll be there now.

581
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,806
I'm sorry about it
it, I'll see you soon.

582
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,005
He asked how the results.

583
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:27,983
We have to leave this room for a while.

584
00:52:28,952 --> 00:52:31,887
We have to do much else.

585
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:40,862
Where do these things?

586
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:42,896
30 feet in length.

587
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,927
We have to measure it
from here to the garage.

588
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:51,839
From the master bedroom to the yard,
and back. It was very long.

589
00:52:51,842 --> 00:52:53,901
Tim...

590
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:57,103
Team!

591
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:09,081
Your call is being transferred,
please try again.

592
00:53:09,092 --> 00:53:14,893
Your call is being
transferred, Tim...

593
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:17,934
Team.

594
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:24,841
How did I get here?

595
00:53:24,975 --> 00:53:27,876
What are you talking about? You
out here and you're sitting.

596
00:53:27,878 --> 00:53:30,039
- I was outside.
- Not.

597
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,039
Are you really out there?
Let's say in front of the camera.

598
00:53:36,086 --> 00:53:38,816
Hey, hey!

599
00:53:38,856 --> 00:53:42,053
If it is true, I want to know when.

600
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:44,823
Do you hear me?

601
00:53:44,828 --> 00:53:46,989
Do you understand?

602
00:54:29,106 --> 00:54:31,074
Where father, mother?

603
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:33,076
I do not know.

604
00:54:33,111 --> 00:54:35,840
You do not know where my father is?

605
00:54:35,846 --> 00:54:38,076
I do not know where he is.

606
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:41,908
I just know where he
be appropriate to say.

607
00:54:50,961 --> 00:54:53,828
Kaylie...

608
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:59,096
What is he doing there?

609
00:55:08,845 --> 00:55:11,075
I did not meet him.

610
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,917
I see him.

611
00:55:15,919 --> 00:55:17,944
Be quiet.

612
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:24,857
When?

613
00:55:26,096 --> 00:55:28,963
Overnight.

614
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:36,096
He is in a healthy state.

615
00:55:37,107 --> 00:55:40,042
He's not crazy.

616
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,944
What did he do?

617
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:46,848
I do not know.

618
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:49,113
It was weird.

619
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,922
Maybe he does not realize it.

620
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:57,827
He wants to stay here.

621
00:56:04,968 --> 00:56:08,062
He's not welcome here.

622
00:58:44,928 --> 00:58:46,987
Mother?

623
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:50,990
Mom!

624
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,898
Release him!

625
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:23,896
Not!

626
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:28,903
Run!

627
00:59:29,973 --> 00:59:31,941
Quick, quick!

628
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:37,947
Mom, stop it!

629
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,909
Marrie?

630
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:47,881
Hey, hey!

631
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:52,885
What are you doing?

632
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,949
You did nothing?

633
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:01,896
You guys have done it.

634
01:01:01,898 --> 01:01:04,025
- Whether the mother is okay?
- Mom is okay.

635
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:09,834
In just fainted she does nothing,
you go in and close the door.

636
01:01:25,922 --> 01:01:28,015
Yes, if you can come here?

637
01:02:08,131 --> 01:02:10,861
- Please do not go.
- You're not anything.

638
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:27,849
You're not anything.

639
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:29,782
We'll be fine.

640
01:02:30,053 --> 01:02:31,042
Team.

641
01:02:32,956 --> 01:02:33,980
Wake up!

642
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:35,882
AKu here.

643
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:37,051
Are you all right?

644
01:02:39,863 --> 01:02:40,830
Okay..

645
01:03:03,853 --> 01:03:06,845
Your mother is quite ill.

646
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:11,925
And now we have to
soon forget it.

647
01:03:11,961 --> 01:03:15,988
When he recovered later,
he could catch up with us.

648
01:03:18,868 --> 01:03:19,892
Why?

649
01:03:21,938 --> 01:03:25,101
So, Tim, Kaylie..

650
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:31,002
We should always stay away from the room
it, do you understand?

651
01:03:33,983 --> 01:03:35,883
What's in there?

652
01:03:39,956 --> 01:03:41,856
Yes..

653
01:03:42,058 --> 01:03:46,995
You do not want to harm us all right.

654
01:03:46,996 --> 01:03:48,987
But I need your cooperation.

655
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:53,001
Does no one
that help us?

656
01:04:03,012 --> 01:04:04,001
Here you are.

657
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:09,817
I saved it under.

658
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:33,843
Team!

659
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:37,980
Tim, realized!

660
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:40,839
Team!

661
01:04:50,894 --> 01:04:52,862
Can anyone help me?

662
01:05:27,897 --> 01:05:28,955
What?

663
01:05:29,899 --> 01:05:30,888
No nothing.

664
01:06:47,043 --> 01:06:49,841
Clearly there is something wrong here.

665
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:34,855
Come on, Kaylie..

666
01:07:48,037 --> 01:07:50,801
There is no food anywhere, yeah.

667
01:07:50,873 --> 01:07:52,033
What is the problem?

668
01:07:52,942 --> 01:07:55,035
- We have not eaten.
- Later.

669
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:58,914
We were already hungry.

670
01:07:58,981 --> 01:08:00,881
What is the importance?

671
01:08:01,117 --> 01:08:03,915
We need to call for help for mom!

672
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:27,034
This is stupid.

673
01:08:27,977 --> 01:08:29,911
We will break down the door.

674
01:08:30,046 --> 01:08:32,037
- But dad..
- I do not care what the father said.

675
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,869
Mother?

676
01:09:41,918 --> 01:09:42,976
He had to be taken away.

677
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:47,916
- You told me he..
- That's your problem if you do not think!

678
01:09:47,957 --> 01:09:53,020
I told you not to go into
the room, but you still get in, why?!

679
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:56,863
You shut your mouth.

680
01:09:57,834 --> 01:10:02,897
You stop scaring discouraged
brother and close your mouth.

681
01:10:12,915 --> 01:10:14,906
You're not anything.
Are you okay?

682
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:16,814
Dah!

683
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,951
What did he say?

684
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:24,884
He said we had to call for help.

685
01:10:28,097 --> 01:10:30,861
We will ask for the help of anyone?

686
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:35,030
I also do not know.

687
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:39,007
I do not know.

688
01:11:02,131 --> 01:11:03,894
Hi, how are you?

689
01:11:03,933 --> 01:11:09,894
I'm really sorry,
but your son ask me here.

690
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:14,876
Did you know? It all brings
we're here, I mean, he..

691
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:17,812
You know, this is the feeling of a mother..

692
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:19,075
As a mother.

693
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:22,016
Well, this is nothing.

694
01:11:22,852 --> 01:11:25,821
Well, I'm sorry
what happened to you.

695
01:11:25,855 --> 01:11:27,880
I hope everything will be better soon.

696
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:28,948
Thank you.

697
01:11:29,892 --> 01:11:34,090
And what do you know? How
with plans next week?

698
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:36,792
Nice! Do it.

699
01:11:36,832 --> 01:11:38,060
- See you later!
- Be careful.

700
01:12:05,061 --> 01:12:06,892
Come on..

701
01:12:07,997 --> 01:12:10,932
We have to be really ready.

702
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:55,843
That's it..

703
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,004
Team!

704
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:44,917
Marie?

705
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:51,866
How do we counteract this?

706
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:53,061
But this is okay.

707
01:14:39,949 --> 01:14:42,110
This is it.

708
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:53,954
Dad?

709
01:14:57,967 --> 01:14:59,901
Fix the lamp.

710
01:15:45,047 --> 01:15:47,845
The trick is this?

711
01:16:11,941 --> 01:16:12,999
What the hell?

712
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:17,879
I killed him..

713
01:16:47,009 --> 01:16:48,067
Hello?

714
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:51,011
How is she?

715
01:16:55,851 --> 01:16:57,011
I'm fine.

716
01:16:57,019 --> 01:17:01,786
Okay. I'll see one
hours. I'm talking.

717
01:17:06,028 --> 01:17:08,053
That's the trick.

718
01:17:09,064 --> 01:17:11,032
I did not kill him, I
not possible to do it.

719
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:13,034
Plate, it's not real.

720
01:17:13,035 --> 01:17:16,869
I did not kill him, because
plate instead of a real plate!

721
01:17:40,929 --> 01:17:41,987
Not!

722
01:17:54,043 --> 01:17:55,908
Michael!

723
01:17:55,944 --> 01:17:57,070
What to do?

724
01:17:57,079 --> 01:17:58,910
Oh no..

725
01:18:03,919 --> 01:18:06,820
Let's get out of here.

726
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:19,891
Hello?

727
01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:22,927
I need the police to come to my house.

728
01:18:23,872 --> 01:18:25,066
Okay. Alright.

729
01:18:26,008 --> 01:18:28,875
The police are on their way.
They will solve this problem.

730
01:18:28,877 --> 01:18:29,969
Kaylie!

731
01:18:29,978 --> 01:18:32,973
We did nothing!

732
01:18:33,982 --> 01:18:35,950
- Come on!
- All right, all right.

733
01:18:35,951 --> 01:18:38,852
- But we should go back inside.
- No...

734
01:18:38,887 --> 01:18:41,856
- No...
- The mechanism, we can not leave it.

735
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:44,825
All you have to do is
wait, no more than half an hour.

736
01:18:44,827 --> 01:18:45,987
Pemicumu Tool!

737
01:18:46,028 --> 01:18:48,087
- We have to take it.
- Yes!

738
01:18:48,097 --> 01:18:50,065
We're done. It's over.

739
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,933
We have to stay here and
watch the thing die.

740
01:19:16,959 --> 01:19:19,860
Did you see them?

741
01:19:20,129 --> 01:19:22,120
Did you see them there?

742
01:19:30,939 --> 01:19:33,032
- Let us seek the help!
- Wait a minute!

743
01:19:37,112 --> 01:19:40,843
- Did you call for help?
- Yes, I waited in front of my house.

744
01:19:40,883 --> 01:19:42,908
You came out and now you're calling.

745
01:19:42,918 --> 01:19:48,982
But that is not useful, but it
useless, but it's useless.

746
01:19:49,024 --> 01:19:51,015
Pity you.

747
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,060
We have to do it.

748
01:20:01,837 --> 01:20:03,031
We can not do anything.

749
01:20:03,972 --> 01:20:06,099
- Wait for it.
- But it's no use.

750
01:20:06,842 --> 01:20:10,835
But we face is very.. very strange.

751
01:20:50,018 --> 01:20:53,044
You will continue here? We have to get out.

752
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,019
Yes, we must destroy it.

753
01:21:28,991 --> 01:21:30,049
Now what?

754
01:21:30,092 --> 01:21:34,028
I already told
you to go from here.

755
01:21:34,062 --> 01:21:35,893
What?

756
01:22:03,058 --> 01:22:04,116
Shh!

757
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:39,943
Kylie?

758
01:23:41,857 --> 01:23:42,949
What happened?

759
01:23:46,094 --> 01:23:47,959
You still have not noticed?

760
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:51,890
There is a figure being up there.

761
01:23:52,034 --> 01:23:55,060
You're acting weird and scary outside.

762
01:23:56,038 --> 01:23:59,804
That's our target creature,
we should get out of here.

763
01:23:59,841 --> 01:24:01,832
I do not know where to go anymore.

764
01:24:01,877 --> 01:24:03,936
We will, I promise.

765
01:24:03,979 --> 01:24:05,037
And you have to..

766
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:10,916
Team.

767
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,954
What should we do now?

768
01:24:46,922 --> 01:24:48,082
He's down there.

769
01:24:49,057 --> 01:24:51,924
- Is he going to kill us?
- We have to get out of here.

770
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,123
- How do I?
- We had to go without his knowledge.

771
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:58,827
Do you want to continue to be up here?

772
01:24:59,968 --> 01:25:02,903
- What can we do?
- We run alone.

773
01:25:08,844 --> 01:25:09,902
Are you ready?

774
01:25:10,946 --> 01:25:13,881
- Not.
- We have to get out of here.

775
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:16,017
We ran down there.

776
01:25:18,987 --> 01:25:20,921
We have to get out of here.

777
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:24,891
Yes, I think you're right.

778
01:25:28,997 --> 01:25:30,794
Are you ready?

779
01:25:30,832 --> 01:25:33,995
I promise you we can definitely do this.

780
01:25:34,035 --> 01:25:36,026
You should be able to do it.

781
01:26:57,986 --> 01:26:59,851
What will we do now?

782
01:27:08,864 --> 01:27:10,058
I will not give up.

783
01:27:12,868 --> 01:27:14,836
You want me to leave you like that?

784
01:27:21,943 --> 01:27:22,967
No.

785
01:27:43,932 --> 01:27:45,058
Do you hear me?

786
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:11,084
Team.

787
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:38,011
Stay away, stay away from me.

788
01:28:38,853 --> 01:28:40,912
No, do not come any closer!

789
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:22,056
Kaylie.

790
01:29:24,966 --> 01:29:26,092
Hurry.

791
01:29:30,905 --> 01:29:32,099
Run!

792
01:30:51,086 --> 01:30:53,020
Open the door!

793
01:30:57,992 --> 01:30:59,084
See!

794
01:31:02,897 --> 01:31:05,862
The whole place is
It will not end.

795
01:31:05,967 --> 01:31:08,834
I think I've said
you not to be here.

796
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:23,884
Please, it's not you.

797
01:31:24,919 --> 01:31:26,045
This is me.

798
01:31:27,088 --> 01:31:30,023
I consciously do this.

799
01:31:32,827 --> 01:31:34,021
I do not want you here.

800
01:31:35,864 --> 01:31:36,990
She is me.

801
01:31:52,046 --> 01:31:53,911
Release him!

802
01:32:35,023 --> 01:32:36,820
Run.

803
01:32:39,994 --> 01:32:41,928
No, no!

804
01:32:42,997 --> 01:32:44,828
Father.

805
01:32:52,941 --> 01:32:55,000
Run! Quickly run!

806
01:33:21,102 --> 01:33:22,967
Kaylie!

807
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:26,965
Kaylie.

808
01:33:39,921 --> 01:33:41,047
Kaylie.

809
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,797
Mother.

810
01:34:55,997 --> 01:34:58,090
Tim, is that you?

811
01:35:00,068 --> 01:35:03,868
I want you to promise
me you will stay strong.

812
01:35:04,105 --> 01:35:06,005
Do not ever be afraid.

813
01:35:13,014 --> 01:35:15,005
You have to get through this.

814
01:35:17,985 --> 01:35:19,816
For mom and dad.

815
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:25,891
I promise.

816
01:35:35,903 --> 01:35:38,963
Kaylie. This is me.

817
01:35:40,842 --> 01:35:41,900
No.

818
01:35:43,911 --> 01:35:47,847
Kaylie! Kaylie up! Kaylie!

819
01:35:48,082 --> 01:35:51,848
Kaylie! Help me!

820
01:35:51,886 --> 01:35:53,854
Hear me!

821
01:36:26,087 --> 01:36:29,853
- He who contacted us?
- Yes, he called 911.

822
01:36:29,991 --> 01:36:32,050
And this is what happened.

823
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,060
You'll take me where?

824
01:36:41,869 --> 01:36:43,837
Kaylie, this is not my fault.

825
01:36:44,105 --> 01:36:45,970
Do not take it, stop it!

826
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:47,873
Stop it!

827
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:50,935
I did not do!
I did not do!

828
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:52,809
I did not do!

829
01:36:52,847 --> 01:36:54,838
Do not take me, not me who did it.

830
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:57,817
Not me! I did not do!

831
01:36:59,854 --> 01:37:01,822
It was not my fault!

832
01:37:02,857 --> 01:37:04,017
I did not do!

833
01:37:04,091 --> 01:37:07,959
Do not be afraid, do not
forget your promise.

834
01:37:10,898 --> 01:37:12,866
Do not forget your promise.
