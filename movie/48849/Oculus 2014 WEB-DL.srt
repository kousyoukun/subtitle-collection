Kaylie !

2
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:23,816
I shot .

3
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,683
I have always
that dream.

4
00:01:28,683 --> 00:01:30,683
But I do not know
meaning .

5
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:32,749
I've never had a gun.

6
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,617
I know.

7
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:37,816
Sit .

8
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:44,607
Have a deep acceptance
responsibilities.

9
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,813
And I think you suffer from
hallucinations ...

10
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,746
but also in your subconscious.

11
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,739
That is my opinion . But I think it is not
dangerous to himself or others .

12
00:01:56,812 --> 00:02:00,671
And I think you should take
charges as ordered.

13
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:03,612
By the way , will soon be your
23rd birthday .

He said he had a

If you need help , we have a system
support even better.

35
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:28,600
But Kaylie has to do
by itself and I think ...

36
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:31,600
It is important that
see her again .

37
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:35,733
But it is more important to protect
your recovery .

Hello, brother.

44
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,723
Here's the check.

45
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:46,718
By the way ...

46
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,590
I have searched for an apartment
which is not very big ...

47
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:53,516
but it's beautiful .

48
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,782
Here are the facts.

49
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:58,720
And soon see
if they give it to us .

I thank you.

51
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:04,720
Well, I wanted
give you this.

52
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:09,653
Why do not you want me?

53
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:16,785
Do not want to ? Not that I do not
I let you come and see me.

54
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:21,785
I just had to solve some
things on my own.

55
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,718
I understand .

56
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:35,584
I am your family. And all
matters is you're here now .

57
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,651
Hey!

58
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,583
Do you remember ?

59
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,581
What do you mean ?

60
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:54,641
You know, you see things ...

61
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:56,707
feel strange things ...

62
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,508
feel dead people ...

63
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,781
is something that always
bothered me and you too .

64
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:04,708
It took a year to
used to that.

65
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,845
I do not know how you did it yourself, but not
we'll see in a few days .

66
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,580
I think it will be fine.

67
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:14,578
Kaylie not talk about it .

68
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:17,644
Did you programmed ?

00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,777

Let's talk
a moment.

95
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:29,760
I do not know if I need a table here .

96
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,768
You're going to say or you'll go ...

97
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,767
Why are you silent?

98
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:43,560
I was hoping to acquire
package in 3 parts , but ...

99

Is it not supposed to
you had to find out ?

I'll do whatever you want .

Thank you.

102
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:57,766
But it is something ostentatious, is not it ?

103
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:03,625
I get confused , I thought you loved
old things for you and the kids.

104
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:07,763
Yes , I know, but only a few pieces
not fill in many parts.

105
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:09,691
Well, I'll tell you what ...

106
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:12,764
I asked another company
some new furniture.

107
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:16,762
- What do you think ?
- Is everything okay right?

108
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,827

forget what happened .

00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,691
Promise?

Well my birthday 20

And I really need your help.

118
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,818
Good night.

119
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:48,615
I was seeing the
scar of 10 years.

120
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:51,817
Let me check it .
I am a professional .

121
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:55,614
What scar?

122
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:59,540
You know what .

123
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:02,814
- I'm glad you
we are all together .

124
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,614
Okay, love.

Oh God !

126

Hey , hey .
All is well .

127
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:04,790
What is the problem?

128
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,524
It was just a nightmare.

129
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,723
Relax, I 'm with you.

130
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,586
All right.

- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:52,509
I wanted to share something with you.

133
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,509
I think we have a network.

134
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:57,648
- Okay .
- I have some reports of people .

135
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:00,508
What do you think ?

136
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,648
They are snapshots of crimes
they were on your computer.

137
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,780
I know I should not do it.

138
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,707
No,not at all !

139
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,639
I do not know what to say.

140
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,715
I just changed my mind.

141
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:27,514
Okay, you only need a
explanation for the murders.

142
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,777
I do not think that is the
time to tell you.

143
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:45,642
But I think there are many things
Rare do not know.

144
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:53,503
I hope you understand
that part of my life.

145
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,174
As I have many
things on my mind ...

146
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:58,575
and I think better
we go slowly.

147
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,572
I promise .

148
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,436
All right.

149
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,572
Usually I do not do transfers ,
until payments are received.

150
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,632
Well, then fix that.

151
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,705
I'll give you something to
will make you feel better.

152
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,446
I think not.

153
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:18,638
I'll take full responsibility .

154
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,571
If this is what you believe .

155
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:25,638
Well, it's all yours.

156
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,766
You Again ?

157
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
You must be hungry .

158
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:18,698
I know it still hurts.

159
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,479
Miss?

160
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:46,686
Are you okay ?

161
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,686
I 'm fine.

162
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:57,486
The guys who
take out coming soon .

See you at home.

165
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:18,547
My car is there.

166
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:20,673
- Hello.
- Hello.

167
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,541
- I bought a phone.
-Great !

168
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:23,681
I need you
firm here .

169
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:26,681
I hope you're not
mad about last night.

170
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,613
Can we see
late to talk ?

171
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:31,472
Of course , come to my house.

172
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,480
And where is home?

173
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:36,545
No. .. The house .

174
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,666
Yes , I have it in front of me .

175
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,400
- I do not know , maybe in half an hour .
- Is that right ?

176
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:20,607
Okay, we are .

177
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,539
Goodbye.

178
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:12,666
Ho . Rays !
You caught me off guard.

179
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:20,464
In one sentence .
Do not lose!

180
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,523
OMG!

181
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,598
I'm the only girl who has a
phone in my class.

182
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,664
This is terrible.

183
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:29,463
Thanks for nothing.

184
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,662
I'll buy one for you
right now!

185
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,389
The love of my life .

186
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:40,527
Well, I like to eat pineapple.

187
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:48,660
I ask you to never eat
nails , like his father .

188
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,454
- It's my father.
- Yes , it's your father.

189
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:55,526
What were you doing in
office , Dad? today

190
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,519
Yes , Dad ...

191
00:20:57,592 --> 00:21:00,525
What were you doing in the office today ?

192
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:02,592
What?

193
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,523
I do not know , some girl ...

194
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:08,526
she was beautiful .

195
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,658
I know nothing .

196
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,382
<i> was not so small ... < / i >

197
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:40,521
- Buy a dog.
- A dog?

198
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:42,654
Yet to be named .

199
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:45,654
It has no name yet ...

200
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:47,720
Ho , of course.

201
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,586
You have not been here since that time .

202
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:55,454
Relax.

203
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,651
Why do not you look around ?

204
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:10,571
I am sad for Marck gave some
nobody knows ...

205
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:12,575
I got sick from Young .

206
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:17,574
I was the only home
I was going to school.

207
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,642
I think we should try ...

208
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,642
you know, after ...

209
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,574
So want to help me get something
before you go?

210
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,505
- What's this ?
- Over here .

211
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:46,437
Have you ever wanted something ?

212
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:47,638
This way.

213
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:24,632
- What's this ?
- An anchor .

214
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,565
An emergency switch .

215
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:31,364
Then . How have you been
since then?

216
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:35,422
Not long
I have just begun.

217
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:37,365
I am better prepared .

218
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:44,630
I expected a little more ...

219
00:24:58,626 --> 00:24:59,627
well ...

220
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:05,560
My name is Kaylie Russell, I have 20 years
And this is my brother Tim Russell ...

221
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,559
We are orphans.

222
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:14,692
He is 22 years ...
They are 4:15 p.m. October 15, 2005 .

223
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:22,417
I'm taking my precautions in
time to show the video.

224
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,423
I have 3 cameras and each one is
of electrical energy .

225
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:27,624
Automatically filmed
any anomaly.

226
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:30,555
I'm also recording all audio
on my cell .

227
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,417
And now I ask my
brother your phone.

228
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:36,555
To control all
electronic devices .

229
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:44,555
You know ... I bought it on sale .

230
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:46,556
Thank you, Tim .

231
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:53,481
This alarm is set
to beep every 45 minutes.

232
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,480
This alarm is set this
for lunch .

233
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:59,422
And I have enough water to
not pass dehydration.

234
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:00,687
Now the house.

235
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:07,546
Each room has sensors that
display information to a software ...

236
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,417
and detect any change of 5 degrees,
and will sound an alarm ...

237
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:16,484
I do it all for
be very careful.

238
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,549
So ...

239
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:23,416
The purpose of today 's
subject to tax on the mirror.

240
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:26,616
either a supernatural force .

241
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:30,474
You can call it whatever you want ,
ghost hunting .

242
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,082
But this object is responsible
of at least 45 deaths ...

243
00:26:33,082 --> 00:26:35,478
34 missing and 18 ...
people in a coma.

244
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,547
- Kaylie , can stop
for a second.

245
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,415
No, do not touch the camera.

246
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,481
Sorry.

247
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:52,411
The origin of the mirror is unknown , but
I have this to ...

248
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:55,612
He took me to London ...

249
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:58,472
the year 1754.

250
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:01,366
Philip Blaster, if
turn around the image ...

251
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:04,478
you can see the mirror
is on the side of the fireplace.

252
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:06,475
- Another precaution .
- Hello love, how are you ?

253
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,469
Hi , I just see if you have
reason, like you asked .

254
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:19,411
Yes , I'm fine . I am with my brother.
It will end at approximately one hour.

255
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:21,467
Well, of course ...

256
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:25,342
I'll call you in 5 minutes
I love you .

257
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:29,602
An unexpected call
my boyfriend Michael Dumont.

258
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:32,599
I told him that my brother had been
released and called to see if ...

259
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:35,475
all was well. Otherwise, the call
the police immediately ...

260
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,534
Which room will you say ?

261
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:39,473
Anything. Take this.

262
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:43,607
Then , in 1955 , Fhillip
Blaster was found ...

263
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,539
hanged in his fireplace.

264
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:51,537
Well, this went from family
family, and one of them took the mirror.

265
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,331
asked where the church
investigate the whole issue .

266
00:27:56,404 --> 00:28:00,605
The mirror went to another owner
in another auction in 1758.

267
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:06,469
and the other owner was Robert Plasty .

268
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,494
In 1864 , his family paid
£ 300 for the mirror.

269
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:12,682
By the way , some live
currently in Connecticut .

270
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:15,668
He also had relatives in Atlanta.

271
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:20,394
Good . Years later
was photographed ...

272
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,533
as can be appreciated .

273
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:26,393
And soon after , died .

274
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:32,460
Unfortunately , the mirror disappeared
in the ocean in 1855.

275
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:35,467
And from that day the mirror
has been lost .

276
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,326
For a few centuries to
they found it.

277
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,391
The next picture is
Oppose Mary in 1984.

278
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:43,463
She had the mirror in his private bathroom.

279
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,664
And two weeks later, he found dead
in her bathtub .

280
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:52,462
Now the official report of his death ,
reads: Dehydration .

281
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:56,464
She died because I do not take anything
water for 3 days.

282
00:28:56,537 --> 00:29:00,588
Then this family in 1993.

283
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:04,389
Neighbors say they heard screams
leave the house .

284
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:06,595
This photo was taken in
the time of his death.

285
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:14,320
And like other
families end up dead .

286
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:17,393
They see a child lying
on the floor dead .

287
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:20,386
Practically a skeleton.

288
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,460
But his body showed no
no wound .

289
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,391
What is very strange.

290
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:25,594
And we want to know what is happening .

291
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:30,451
Some years later, his sister
also died .

292
00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:34,392
He went crazy , many doctors have
examined but could not do anything.

293
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:37,391
and then a priest said that children ...

294
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,522
Let's eat .

295
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:58,521
Who are you talking about in the video?

296
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:04,387
All are scared because the type
school found us .

297
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,447
Why?

298
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
And I just miss you
murderer be called Dad.

299
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:11,521
Not allow it.

300
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,452
Why was the mirror?

301
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:18,518
Kaylie , we were kids .

302
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:24,377
And what happened to my father does not know if
It was murder .

303
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,383
But he was a madman who tortured
many people ...

304
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,648
Call me crazy , or whatever you want .

305
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:41,449
But do not let
about it that way.

306
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:47,581
This guy is the year 1995 , he began
do strange things ...

307
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:50,507
And so far, his death
remains a mystery .

308
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,583
And in 65 years , in California ...

309
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:55,508
you can see the mirror again .

310
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:59,306
And then the lady
photo also disappeared.

311
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,380
Later found to be
lifeless.

312
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:07,446
In 1976 , the girl was found
dead in his room, bled .

313
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,438
And again the mirror was there.

314
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:12,372
In 2002 .

315
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,645
You know that's not much difference between
cause and murder.

316
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:16,376
I know, maybe
you're wrong .

317
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:19,437
Okay, but do not say what
do not know if it's true .

318
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,575
If someone with the mirror is injured
with your car you're going to call murder.

319
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,368
Why we escape ?

320
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,376
In fact, why would the mirror
to pay for this ?

321
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:28,577
I do not know .

322
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,376
Now get out of here , Kaylie .

323
00:31:31,576 --> 00:31:33,577
And we must talk
why are we here?

324
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:36,509
Right.

325
00:31:37,508 --> 00:31:39,576
2002. , This man
appears in his office ...

326
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,441
Dead named Alan Russell.

327
00:31:43,574 --> 00:31:45,374
Strange, is not it?

328
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:47,374
Mary 's husband .

329
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:53,434
This girl also goes into a crisis
psychological and eventually dies .

330
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:56,440
Being tortured in their
house for his own family.

331
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:57,504
I know.

332
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:00,372
You say tortured by her husband.

333
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:03,570
Just repeat what they say
the police reports .

334
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:07,438
But her husband was taken to
death by her own son.

335
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,437
Right in front of her daughter.

336
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:18,435
No time to try it , since the
People are responsible for their actions ...

337
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,296
Alan Russell was not a murderer .
He was a victim.

338
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:26,295
He was the victim of force
supernatural living in that mirror.

339
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,434
So why do not we finish this now
and break this fucking mirror?

340
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,501
I do not remember, do you ?

341
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:39,367
Do you remember ?

342
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,432
That day ... try to break it.

343
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:43,499
Clear .

344
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,430
Genial .

345
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,495
I thought a lot about what
happens to people when they are .

346
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:10,629
You can pass something horrible.

347
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:15,494
I know of many guards.

348
00:33:17,427 --> 00:33:19,426
And I know that the police can
say many things ...

349
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:23,362
But never the truth.

350
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:31,561
How many had to investigate
for if you wanted to ?

351
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,293
Why not break it ?

352
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:43,285
Because I try to have a
conversation with you.

353
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:46,625
There is only one person record
He tries to break the mirror .

354
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:48,490
Jerry Alan in 1977.

355
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:52,485
He tried to do it at home alone.

356
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,420
He always said he was going to destroy,
but could never give any blow.

357
00:33:58,493 --> 00:34:04,422
And it ended up dying in a
accident.

358
00:34:05,355 --> 00:34:08,354
No one can destroy the mirror.

359
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:10,356
just try
search for answers.

360
00:34:13,488 --> 00:34:16,354
You know why I did not break the mirror?

361
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:20,551
Besides being accused of
destruction to property .

362
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:23,418
Why is not my prey?

363
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:26,553
It's yours !

364
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:28,552
You have to do it alone.

365
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:31,484
So I take my precautions .

366
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:35,345
You are viewing an anchor 80 kilos .

367
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:41,278
Which is connected to a timer that
is released in case something happens.

368
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:44,410
Electricity is important and
We are 10 seconds late.

369
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,549
Verifies that the timer is someone
every 30 minutes, I told you.

370
00:34:46,622 --> 00:34:48,548
See, it goes right there.

371
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:56,341
So ...

372
00:34:56,414 --> 00:35:00,479
The other thing we have
to do is survive.

373
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:03,481
So if you want you can go.

374
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:06,479
He will be like having
a gun to his head.

375
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:09,346
I hope many of
problems in this.

376
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,527
Hey guys , can come to
my office for a moment ?

377
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:35,392
I think I was clear in saying
not to do things around here .

378
00:37:35,593 --> 00:37:37,391
We did nothing !

379
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:39,461
I do not go here .

380
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,461
Okay , what is this you ?

381
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,390
We did not .

382
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,527
You know what? I can
feel them at night ...

383
00:37:51,598 --> 00:37:55,389
coming here and
move my stuff.

384
00:37:56,526 --> 00:38:00,455
I was also a child and I know
to do this is not easy .

385
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,388
And I want you back
happen , right?

386
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:08,316
And if it is also
bothering your mother ...

387
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,387
I also want to stop.

388
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:16,456
Do you know how
is this plan without me?

389
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:20,321
I think it's a bad plan.

390
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,321
I remember drinking beer.

391
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:29,321
That already happened . Now , I'm not
the same as before .

392
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:34,253
I can not think of anything else
until we get out of this.

393
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:36,384
Why are plants here?

394
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:42,384
Many plants.

395
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:47,310
- Are your rules anyway.
- It's about time.

396
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,382
The flat has its task.

397
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:51,382
And there is another variable.

398
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:53,317
Dog?

399
00:38:57,517 --> 00:38:59,316
Sorry , puppy .

400
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:07,446
Drink water .

401
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,379
Come on, kid ,let's play !

402
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:24,306
Chase the post!

403
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:25,511
Come on, go for it .

404
00:39:25,585 --> 00:39:27,378
Come on,wake up!

405
00:39:29,444 --> 00:39:33,444
The only thing I bought is for you
you feel safe .

406
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:37,243
Why did you say that
dress someone down here?

407
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:39,375
You think you feel safe ,
but it's the opposite actually .

408
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:44,558
Okay, I'm going to download it
and put key ...

409
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:48,310
sure where we serve
in any emergency.

410
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:53,442
<i> idiot woman . < / i >

411
00:40:01,308 --> 00:40:03,239
What you just told me ?

412
00:40:04,509 --> 00:40:05,506
Nothing .

413
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:42,295
Ah .

414
00:40:42,368 --> 00:40:43,434
Oh ,my God!

415
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:50,303
- Alan .
-I'm working !

416
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:05,300
Who are you talking to?

417
00:41:11,364 --> 00:41:13,430
Is there anything
I do not know?

418
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:18,561
There's something wrong with the dog,
Alan ,bit me !

419
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:20,499
Are you okay ?

420
00:41:22,298 --> 00:41:23,363
I 'm fine , just ...

421
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,355
You've lost in their own world .
Here only ...

422
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:32,298
I'm not lost
in my own work .

423
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:52,287
Children have to do me a favor today.
I have a meeting with a client.

424
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,350
I'll need to be far
my office , okay ?

425
00:41:56,424 --> 00:41:57,424
Okay, Dad.

426
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:01,358
Okay, love you.

427
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:22,419
I'm coming!

428
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,554
Go see what's there then.

429
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:48,417
- Why do not we?
-Dad said no!

430
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,389
Hello boys,
What do they do there?

431
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,299
Something must be done
that damn dog!

432
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:58,276
Well, hello would be nice.

433
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:01,415
He was barking all day.
I had to lock him in the office.

434
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:03,348
Well cálmalo only !

435
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:22,413
Where is ?

436
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:28,273
Well, there is a problem
you are remembering ...

437
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:30,280
- I promise , I 'm not agreeing .
-Yes , you are!

438
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:33,481
I'm just saying what I found .

439
00:43:33,553 --> 00:43:36,412
Do not remember the end of the day ?

440
00:43:36,544 --> 00:43:39,345
Accidents all over the house !

441
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,410
It was something like a damn virus ,
you produce vomiting , fever ...

442
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:49,409
That led us to make plans ...

443
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,343
Mason was sick.

444
00:43:52,277 --> 00:43:54,342
I think I'll take the
veterinarian morning .

445
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:57,343
Bad news. probably
return home alone .

446
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,275
Mom, where is Mason?

447
00:44:03,276 --> 00:44:05,268
Do you remember how this happened ?

448
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:06,473
Are you telling me that?

449
00:44:06,547 --> 00:44:07,334
Why not ?

450
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:08,408
You are wrong .

451
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:12,539
I was out of the office and did not see
enter or leave ...

452
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:16,339
Ever ?
went to see a psychologist ?

453
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:18,198
No, I suppose you do.

454
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:20,339
I was in a place full of psychiatrists .

455
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:23,466
Our brain shows
information as perceived .

456
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,339
It does not refer to what is
perceived reality, but ...

457
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:30,271
- This is idiotic .
- And then combines these strokes.

458
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:33,263
You saw that
many times.

459
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,405
My God,
I dont know what you have done?

460
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:39,202
He was a poor guy who was always in
your office and you are taking those pogs .

461
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:40,270
I pity you .

462
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:42,403
Tell me what you think?

463
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:45,269
What you do not remember what happened
11 years ago ?

464
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:47,268
Or the mirror dogs eat ?

465
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,335
Well, look ...
The dog!

466
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,335
Give her time ...

467
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:00,399
Okay, a little time .

468
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:17,192
<i> I'm not dreaming ,
I heard you talking to someone. < / I >

469
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:20,192
<i> Am I hearing you
through the door </ i>

470
00:45:20,265 --> 00:45:21,465
<i>Well, then tell me you did ! < / i >

471
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:23,324
<i> - I'm not crazy .
- Looks like it < / i > .

472
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:26,463
<i> First we had a thief,
And now this, I'm talking to someone. < / I >

473
00:45:26,536 --> 00:45:28,329
You are driving you crazy !

474
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:33,196
Children .

475
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:39,396
I 'm sorry I woke you .

476
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:44,462
Why were you fighting ?

477
00:45:48,326 --> 00:45:51,193
- I was talking to someone else.
- I also heard .

478
00:45:51,326 --> 00:45:53,328
I became convinced that
I saw many things .

479
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:55,393
But if what we saw was only
Dad walking at night .

480
00:45:56,393 --> 00:45:58,252
She shouted to Dad
during the night?

481
00:45:58,325 --> 00:46:00,459
Mom said she heard voices
from inside the office.

482
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:06,391
This explains what
I saw through the window.

483
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:07,524
When did you see ?

484
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:10,459
The first time when
played in the garden.

485
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:12,256
Mom was at home ?

486
00:46:13,323 --> 00:46:14,522
She was always at home.

487
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,255
Are you sure?

488
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:18,457
Because I do not .

489
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:28,389
Quick, let's leave .

490
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:36,386
I was having a
adventure, that's all.

491
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:37,315
No!

492
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:40,255
Our father was cheating .
So mom went crazy .

493
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:43,182
- Stop it.
- It is not going to tell anyone.

494
00:46:43,255 --> 00:46:44,320
Yes , a bad relationship.

495
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:47,453
So mom did not
nothing when he died.

496
00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:52,378
- The two ended
because it was a bad marriage .

497
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:55,250
It was just an adventure.
It had all the signs which he did.

498
00:46:55,324 --> 00:47:03,178
Did you brainwashed ?
They did not call or anything to prove it .

499
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:04,450
Maybe he knew not leave evidence.

500
00:47:04,523 --> 00:47:05,451
Shut !

501
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:08,517
I talked to everyone and everyone told me
sure was a ghost.

502
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:12,250
There was no sign that he was
is having an affair with someone.

503
00:47:12,323 --> 00:47:15,380
What matters is why
step what happened.

504
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:18,249
Why?

505
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:25,314
Well, I guess you're already
large enough to see it.

506
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:28,248
Do not see the temperature
rose 2 degree here?

507
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:29,308
3 degrees .

508
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:32,247
In this small place and equipment
electronics has to be variation .

509
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,312
Be sure you check it down because .

510
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,447
Okay, let's see .

511
00:47:37,448 --> 00:47:39,311
- Doy tone.
- Static ?

512
00:47:39,445 --> 00:47:40,373
Nothing .

513
00:47:40,447 --> 00:47:44,371
- I already did .
- You can forget Kaylie .

514
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,378
Just forget what
happened to our parents.

515
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,177
I have to do it himself .

516
00:47:52,377 --> 00:47:55,437
I see.

517
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:59,244
You are perfectly normal and
I'm crazy .

518
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,308
Now if you want you can go.

519
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,508
Shut up , you stupid dog !

520
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:07,235
Enough!

521
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:09,375
Okay I'm done ,
I will not let the dog tortures !

522
00:48:09,448 --> 00:48:11,442
- You do not know what you do .
- Yes , I know.

523
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:13,242
-Enough!
- Get out of here .

524
00:48:13,315 --> 00:48:16,176
Enough!
Enough!

525
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,306
No, no, wait!

526
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,505
What?

527
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,505
- You do not know what you do .
- Yes , Kaylie , you're sick .

528
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:33,167
Nothing has
happened today, it happened.

529
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,303
We are all alive , and the mirror is
being a mirror and the only crazy you.

530
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:41,439
And it's not your fault!

531
00:48:42,304 --> 00:48:44,365
It was all my fault.

532
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,430
I had help and you
you stay single .

533
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:51,434
These problems are hard to forget
and not to be ashamed .

534
00:48:52,235 --> 00:48:54,502
We are a family .

535
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:06,299
Kaylie , sorry.

536
00:49:07,435 --> 00:49:09,366
Listen ...

Let's go .

538
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:17,301
Go somewhere else and talk
to move forward together .

539
00:49:35,363 --> 00:49:38,295
Where can we go?

540
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:41,295
- Kaylie ...

541

542
00:49:47,301 --> 00:49:50,228
And we 'll go where we want you .

543
00:49:53,295 --> 00:49:56,154
You have to tell your boyfriend .

544
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,493
He will help you ,
know it will.

545
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:28,288
Kaylie ? ?

546
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:34,290
There it is ...

557
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:50,414
- No. The temperature changed .

I told you I was not lying ,

00:51:58,276 --> 00:51:59,278
Tim , do not make a call,
You do not have to do it out here .

562

We talked about this .

563
00:52:03,342 --> 00:52:07,143
Otherwise, you will not know
Who are you on the phone.

Everything seems fine .

All good in the kitchen.

I do not know where she is!

591
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:41,256
I do not know where he said he would .

592
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:53,188
Kaylie ...

But he was not in the office.

600
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,381
I was on the stairs.

601
00:55:41,382 --> 00:55:43,248
What was he doing ?

602
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:46,109
He looked .

603
00:55:46,182 --> 00:55:48,447
Scared .

604
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:53,245
And he returned to the office.

605
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:57,179
And stayed there.

606
00:56:04,312 --> 00:56:07,378
Would you like to play a game ?

I think we should be together.

648
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,088
I 'm fine , Kaylie .

649
01:07:47,286 --> 01:07:50,012
You have to go
to buy something, Dad.

650
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:51,284
What princess?

651
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,283
- The food .
- No food.

652
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,144
We are hungry .

653
01:07:58,217 --> 01:08:00,083
What princess?

654
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:03,148
We need to call a
Doctor Mom.

655
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:26,278
This is stupid.

656
01:08:27,213 --> 01:08:29,143
I'll tell you
happens.

657
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,278
- But Dad said ...
-I do not care what he said !

658
01:09:03,074 --> 01:09:04,076
Mom?

659
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,202
She needs a doctor!

660
01:09:43,003 --> 01:09:47,134
- You said you were sick , but no ...
- What is the problem?

661
01:09:47,207 --> 01:09:52,202
Why do not you listen ?
I told anyone up to her room !

662
01:09:53,267 --> 01:09:55,996
Why do not you listen ?
Why?

663
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:57,030
There is a reason why and
we have to leave it there .

664
01:09:57,103 --> 01:10:02,062
You and your brother should be kept
far away.

665
01:10:02,135 --> 01:10:05,174
For she did not fence home.

666
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:09,655
Now get out of here.

667
01:10:12,131 --> 01:10:14,131
<i> Okay, thank you .
Goodbye . < / I >

668
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:19,130
What did the doctor say?

669
01:10:22,063 --> 01:10:24,065
He said he has to
talk to my dad .

670
01:10:27,328 --> 01:10:30,063
But it will not.

671
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:34,261
We have to do everything .

672
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:38,196
You have to talk to Grandpa.

673
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,051
Hey, Dad !

674
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:09,049
<i> - sorry to hear that , she was outstanding.
- I know, Dad < / i > .

675
01:11:09,122 --> 01:11:14,057
Suddenly became ill , I mean ...
is ... I was not a mother.

676
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,984
I am sure that

677
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:18,256
this is nothing .

678
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:21,189
She will be fine !

679
01:11:22,056 --> 01:11:24,984
Okay, I 'm sorry I bothered you.

680
01:11:25,057 --> 01:11:27,055
I hope she
recovers soon .

681
01:11:27,128 --> 01:11:28,122
Thank you.

682
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,320
You know , be a party next
week, is his birthday.

683
01:11:33,394 --> 01:11:35,982
Perfect ! , I'll be there.

Tim !

689
01:13:43,036 --> 01:13:44,103
Kaylie ? ?

690
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:51,028
we were
without electricity.

691
01:13:51,101 --> 01:13:52,236
But that's okay .

692
01:14:39,096 --> 01:14:41,294
It 's time.

693
01:14:52,027 --> 01:14:53,094
Kaylie ? ?

694
01:14:57,162 --> 01:14:59,091
Did you fix the lights?

695
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,019
Cute tricks.

696
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,150
Kaylie .
Oh , my God ...

697
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,018
I killed him .

698
01:16:46,146 --> 01:16:47,205

<i> 'll call you in an hour. < / i >

702
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:07,211
It's a trick .

703
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:10,210
I did not kill him .

704
01:17:10,283 --> 01:17:12,136
It's not real.

705
01:17:12,209 --> 01:17:16,008
Did not kill him because
the dish was not real.

706
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:41,137
No!

707
01:17:53,203 --> 01:17:54,994
Michael !

708
01:17:55,067 --> 01:17:56,202
My God,
What have I done ?

01:17:56,275 --> 01:17:58,070
Oh no.

710
01:18:03,069 --> 01:18:05,935
Let's go .

711
01:18:18,002 --> 01:18:18,994
Hello?

712
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:22,066
I need an ambulance .

713
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:24,199
All right.

714
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,999
An ambulance is coming,
everything will be fine .

715
01:18:28,072 --> 01:18:29,059
Kaylie !

716
01:18:29,132 --> 01:18:30,925
We did nothing !

717
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:32,131
All is well!

718
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,065
-Come on!
- Okay , okay.

719
01:18:35,138 --> 01:18:37,999
When was the last time
you went to the kitchen?

720
01:18:38,073 --> 01:18:40,992
- I do not know .
- Your plan were fine.

721
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:43,925
What we have to do is wait
no more than half an hour.

722
01:18:43,998 --> 01:18:45,130
You switch
is hot!

723
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:47,195
- Did you ask for help ?
- Yes , we end this is over.

724
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,061
We have to stay here and
see how that thing dies.

725
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:18,993
He wants you back.

726
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:21,259
No, this is another trick
and I'm standing there.

727
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,190
- Seek help.
-Wait a minute!

728
01:19:36,258 --> 01:19:39,915
Did you call for
ask for help?

729
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:42,055
If I just call them.
We 're on our way .

730
01:19:42,128 --> 01:19:48,122
But this is not useful,
but it is useless , but it is useless ...

731
01:19:48,193 --> 01:19:50,122
Too bad ...

732
01:19:57,053 --> 01:19:58,187
We 're fine.

733
01:20:00,986 --> 01:20:02,188
We can not do anything.

734
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:05,254
- Just wait .
- What do we do?

735
01:20:05,985 --> 01:20:09,986
We will have
to be cautious.

736
01:20:49,113 --> 01:20:52,179
He will come here.

737
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:59,111
Yes , we have to beat .

738
01:21:28,107 --> 01:21:29,176
It's not real.

739
01:21:29,249 --> 01:21:33,101
I told them they are not around .

740
01:21:33,174 --> 01:21:35,041
It is not real,
Okay?

741
01:23:38,023 --> 01:23:39,023
Kaylie ? ?

742
01:23:40,956 --> 01:23:42,022
I 'm fine.

743
01:23:45,223 --> 01:23:47,089
Was he here?

744
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:51,023
I thought we had
climbed the stairs.

745
01:23:51,157 --> 01:23:54,156
I think we want
keep away .

746
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:58,881
You were right , we have to see how
activate this anchor.

747
01:23:58,954 --> 01:24:00,953
- Are you sure it 's gone ?
-He's gone !

748
01:24:01,026 --> 01:24:03,021
I promise .

749
01:24:08,155 --> 01:24:10,019
Tim .

750
01:24:11,085 --> 01:24:13,019
What do we do now?

751
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,150
We come down.

752
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:51,013
-But still there !
- We have no other way.

753
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:54,213
We gotta get out of here ,
well this trip .

754
01:24:55,213 --> 01:24:57,948
We have to get
the stairs.

755
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:02,011
- Did you hear what I said ?
- No, I just cried .

756
01:25:07,946 --> 01:25:09,010
All right?

757
01:25:10,012 --> 01:25:12,947
We must do it together.

758
01:25:13,146 --> 01:25:15,077
Just you and me .

759
01:25:18,078 --> 01:25:20,009
Okay, let's do it .

760
01:25:22,078 --> 01:25:24,010
Just you and me ...

761
01:25:28,077 --> 01:25:29,877
Well, get out of here .

762
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:33,069
We can do this .

763
01:25:33,142 --> 01:25:35,142
Let down
the stairs.

764
01:26:57,065 --> 01:26:58,930
It's not real.

765
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:09,131
It's just a trick.

766
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,928
Did you miss me ?

767
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:22,060
That was ...

768
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:44,125
Tim !

769
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:37,050
Get away , get away from me.

770
01:28:37,919 --> 01:28:39,981
No, do not go near .

No rest .

777
01:31:05,031 --> 01:31:07,899
I told them not to play here.

778
01:31:20,962 --> 01:31:22,895
This is not you.

779
01:31:23,961 --> 01:31:25,097
Yes , I am.

780

I told them not
touch my stuff.

781
01:31:31,894 --> 01:31:33,027
I am the devil.

He is .

Corre.

785
01:32:39,018 --> 01:32:40,952
No.
No.

786
01:32:42,016 --> 01:32:43,886
