1
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,436
Kaylie!

2
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,345
Shhh!

3
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,458
I shot him.

4
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,329
Have often
I had this dream ..

5
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,366
It never
like that before.

6
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,411
Holding a gun.

7
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,242
I know.

8
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,477
It does nothing.

9
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:37,287
You play a sense of responsibility
acts much depth at all.

10
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,484
And it tells me that you
still can not cope with your delusions

11
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,255
And mind you sane.

12
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,421
but also in the mind sane.

13
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:49,402
That is my opinion. That he was not
danger to himself or others.

14
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:53,337
And I believe he could be in
believe if doubting that statement.

15
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,240
From what was previously in
came the first time, thank you.

16
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:13,424
Sold to the father.
Further to item 313.

17
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,331
Well, for the goods at auction,
it is a beautiful antique mirror.

18
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,356
Were taken from there.

19
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:31,242
A mirror has a history
length when the war broke out.

20
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,405
This is the original glass and the original frame.

21
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:40,216
Glass is in excellent condition
unless there was some damage down there.

22
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,450
One part that happens
of the black past.

23
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,516
And we will start
auction starting at $ 10,000.

24
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,324
Do I have 10? And
it is over here in front.

25
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,262
-- Thank you, sir.
-- Sister you talk about your progress.

26
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,324
The message tells me about
give me a job.

27
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,337
It would be very unusual
for your transmission.

28
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,499
We've got 12,000 on the line.
We returned to the room.

29
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,405
Does he know I
come with you?

30
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,500
For more fun.

31
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,337
No. No thank you.

32
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,403
I'm going to see him alone.

33
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,443
-- We bargain now.
-- Of course.

34
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,475
Do you remember what
are we talking about?

35
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,323
You have the auxiliary system
make you better.

36
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,259
Tim, we should be able to
release it by itself.

37
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,296
We recommend that you do not go with
your sister first.

38
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,425
But what is most important,
you protect your healing.

39
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:35,400
-- 16,000.
-- 16,000, that he was 16.

40
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,273
16, two times ..

41
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,278
-- Sold! Please have a work of art
terrific. -- Good.

42
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,229
Please wait a moment.

43
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,353
Hey, little brother.

44
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,399
You happiest day.

45
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,394
Oh, the apartements ..

46
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,273
So I have been studying your data, and you
was in trying to join the citizens.

47
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,244
So I scored
some interesting things.

48
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,440
And while you may
search for what you like.

49
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,381
We've got a lot of class to it.

50
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,353
Kaylie, I do not know how
how to thank you.

51
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,413
Well, I myself can not wait
to tell you.

52
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,317
Suddenly they do not
let me see you.

53
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:09,461
It was not .. It is not you
should not see me.

54
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,434
I just .. I just have a few
thing I need to finish alone.

55
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,403
Then okay.

56
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:28,242
I was the only family that is important
is able to see you now.

57
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,355
Hey!

58
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,295
I was not dead.

59
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,300
What do you mean?

60
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,362
You know .. Last
Next time I see you.

61
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,398
I tried to do that.

62
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,239
People disappeared in the ocean.

63
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,472
There is a story in
the missing part.

64
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,449
It took one and a half years
for I can do that.

65
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,509
The best of it is you
only has a few days.

66
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,250
Should be enough.

67
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,292
Kaylie few days for what?

68
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,361
To keep our promises?

69
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,490
I'm relying on it.

70
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,410
Okay, the sofa can put it there.

71
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,504
And the bathroom near the kitchen.

72
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,310
Hey do not do it first.

73
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:36,445
Yes, I immediately get the data I I
will govern what will happen, yes.

74
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,514
Can I call you back later?

75
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:44,386
Jack! I'm sorry, I do not have time
call, I'm very busy at all ..

76
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,398
How does your state?

77
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,264
Tell him he was arrested.

78
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,427
He was not even part of this.

79
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,393
Shoot you from behind!

80
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,270
-- Oh, you were so dead!
-- Wait, wait, honey?

81
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,331
-- Not.
-- What?

82
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,432
Inside this room?

83
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,307
Into the room.

84
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,471
-- Well ..
-- Be careful with the top ..

85
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:04,315
It was really very special.

86
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,416
Hey, everybody!
What did I just say?

87
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,479
-- But the mother?
-- You must be unpacked his boxes.

88
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,420
Alright.

89
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,391
Em, yes, no, talk to me.

90
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,393
-- Okay.
-- Thank you.

91
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,485
Okay.

92
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,360
I'll leave.

93
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,425
Surely I'll be right back.

94
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,491
I do not know if I
need a table here.

95
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,435
Good, you will tell
I, or simply be ..

96
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,461
just be quiet?

97
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:36,272
Or, I'm hoping
for three delicious cake ..

98
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,376
In this small room torture,
If it be?

99
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,291
I get it, okay, I'll
prepare whatever you want.

100
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,293
-- Thank you.
-- Hmm--mmm ..

101
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,453
It was an achievement, is not it?

102
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:56,366
I'm confused. Because if you want to save
antiques, and I've been so so ..

103
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:00,463
Yes, I will only buy what is good
to this place instead of being a shop.

104
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,407
I am giving
Your new home.

105
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,467
The new party, and
with a new heart.

106
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,447
-- You like it?
-- And forever?

107
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,511
Oh, dear as long as I can ..

108
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,380
I did not make you ugly.

109
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:31,292
Are you sure about this? Because
I think you could be with.

110
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:35,337
Yes. I think it's the best.

111
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,374
My office alone.

112
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,318
You promised me you would never
forget what actually happened.

113
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,412
You promised.

114
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,348
I was once 10 years old.

115
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:59,490
Well, I'll go tomorrow night.
And ..

116
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,365
I really need your help.

117
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,500
Night, Timmy.

118
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,330
I finally found a scar
from a few years ago.

119
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,504
Let me see it
with professionally.

120
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,313
What scar?

121
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,279
I know what you've done.

122
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,515
-- So? -- You have to make
together again.

123
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,356
It was not easy.

124
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,386
Oh, God!

125
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,296
Hey you it's okay.

126
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,530
What's wrong?

127
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,235
Calm down.

128
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,468
Relax, I'm here.

129
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,351
That's all right.

130
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,404
-- Hey.
-- Hey.

131
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,281
Sorry, are you busy?

132
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,308
I want to discuss
on this network.

133
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,413
-- Okay.
-- It look ..

134
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,289
What do you think?

135
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:58,388
I get this
from your computer.

136
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,501
I do not mean
surprise you.

137
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,474
Yes, it's okay.

138
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,443
I do not know what to say.

139
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,469
I'm the same.

140
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:20,248
Okay okay, I'll
be honest with you.

141
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,525
I do not need you
said nothing.

142
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,430
I know all
you want to say.

143
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,276
I do not expect you to understand
it's part of my life.

144
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:51,339
It would be hard to understand.

145
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,351
I understand.

146
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,249
Okay.

147
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,353
I usually do not get
Such shipment.

148
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,456
Oh yes, I also never
seen anything like this.

149
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,230
-- It may valuables.
-- I understand.

150
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,395
I'll open it myself.

151
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,303
See what's inside.

152
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,375
Please just, all yours.

153
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,503
It again.

154
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,272
You must be hungry.

155
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,455
Well, it's broken.

156
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,277
Hey you ..

157
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,477
Are you okay?

158
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,456
I was shocked.

159
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,294
You seem to have a problem.

160
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,422
Ok, fine.

161
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,312
We will meet again in the home.

162
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,314
You put it wrote there.

163
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,478
-- Hello.
-- Hey.

164
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,350
-- Are you busy?
-- Not.

165
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,479
I need you to sign here.

166
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,491
I have a feeling
which is not bad overnight.

167
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,418
We need to talk about this.

168
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,293
Of course, I'll be there.

169
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,263
All right, I'll wait.

170
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,325
No, in my house.

171
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,498
I think, I have not told you.

172
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,237
I do not know, maybe
now you already know, right?

173
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,403
Okay.

174
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,309
Goodbye.

175
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,457
Oh shit.

176
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,266
You still did not answer.

177
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,330
Oh my God, I have not
ready for all this.

178
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,433
I'm not the only one
children in my class.

179
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,444
It was very unfortunate.

180
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,242
That's not nothing, Marie.

181
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,446
I almost believe you.

182
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,250
You are my beloved child.

183
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,349
Well, I wish I could eat pineapple.

184
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,489
I could have been there
replace your father.

185
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,235
-- Hey well.
-- It's okay, I'm Marie.

186
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,364
What's wrong with this father's day job?

187
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,307
Yes.

188
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,344
Who is the woman who is no
at the office today?

189
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,377
Not anyone.

190
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,349
I do not believe.

191
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,318
She is beautiful.

192
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,483
I do not know.

193
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,282
The place is small.

194
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,342
Come on, dog.

195
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,443
You named your dog, dog?

196
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,456
I ran out of names.

197
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,518
Are you okay?

198
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,418
You look silent.

199
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,260
You can relax here.

200
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,495
Do you want to top?

201
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,406
It was already in the house, since the beginning.

202
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,410
That's what often occurs in adolescents.

203
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,372
I am a person who is not one of his
many associate while in school.

204
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,443
I hope you do not experience it.

205
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,448
You know, at the start of his.

206
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,384
So are you ready to find out?

207
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,330
How can you
find this thing?

208
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:39,275
You know, trying to, this will
be better for both of us.

209
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,469
Put it over here.

210
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,439
What is it?

211
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,408
One of the defense, not dangerous.

212
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,216
So, umm ..

213
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,315
Umh, I had to make sure we are safe.

214
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,225
I'm better prepared.

215
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,494
I see you're ready.

216
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,473
Well ..

217
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:58,381
My name is Kaylie Russell, My age 23
years, I along with my brother Tim Russell,

218
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,381
His name was given
follow our father's name.

219
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:07,522
He was 21 years old, now
hours of 4:14 pm on October 13th

220
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,501
And we were in 2705 hussel Grand.

221
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:15,302
I'll start by detailing the action
pencegahanku mirror before I reveal it.

222
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,241
There are three cameras, each
with independent power circuits.

223
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,473
With his technology, he could
shows the objective weather.

224
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,413
In addition, I always
My phone alerting,

225
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,315
And now I will
asked my sister phone,

226
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,377
so that I can control
all types of communication.

227
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,392
It's weird, you know.

228
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,388
Follow it.

229
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:46,402
The alarm goes off every 45 minutes, reminding
us to examine all precautions.

230
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,373
The alarm goes off every 3 hours
to remind us to eat.

231
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,275
And we've menyiadakan preparation
food and beverages to prevent dehydration.

232
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,504
And her other,

233
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:00,445
Each room is fitted with the regulator
temperature with automatic temperature change
like the one in the hospital.

234
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:05,253
If there is a greater change
of 5 degrees, he will perform his duties.

235
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,324
Temperature can also extrem
be very dangerous.

236
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,428
So ..

237
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:16,297
The purpose of today's experiment,
is to prove that this glass,

238
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,497
is home to the power
unexpected supernatural.

239
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,399
Because evidence suggests that the presence of
some object that holds the power of evil,

240
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:28,311
And it is responsible for at least 45 of its
cases that occurred in the last several decades.

241
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,372
-- Would you stop for a while.
-- Do not.

242
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,282
Do not, do not touch his camera.

243
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,341
Sorry.

244
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,295
Case I get is
of cases is unknown.

245
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,493
Forgotten by history, deliberately
done by some people.

246
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,401
In the year 1754 ..

247
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:57,342
Saul Blaster, 17--year--old boy
found hanging in the fireplace.

248
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,334
Another precaution.

249
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,410
Hello, I just look at you,
like you asked.

250
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:12,254
I'm not fine, I'm just
need a few more hours.

251
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,392
Uh .. of course.

252
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,226
I'll call you after
a few minutes, I love you.

253
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,491
I just picked up the phone
from my fiance, Michael Dumont.

254
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,492
I told him I fret
spending time with my brother,

255
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,301
and provide instruction on its
to contact the authorities,

256
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,432
-- If I do not pick up the phone.
-- I'm still here.

257
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,306
Nothing personal.

258
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,437
So in 1755, the case
which is almost the same place.

259
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,415
It's just that he hanged
on his porch.

260
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:44,411
Well, the equation in addition to the way they die
is, they both have the same
mirrors that we have here.

261
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:49,223
To demonstrate the seriousness of this case, I
will show a warrant to
a search of his home.

262
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,492
Because the case does not go unsolved,
so the case was closed in 1784.

263
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:59,327
But then a similar case occurred
more on this guy, Howard Glancy, 1864.

264
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:05,501
This guy has a weight of 300 pounds,
when compared to today's equivalent
the weight of the baby whale.

265
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,502
She has a dance hall in Atlanta.

266
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:13,280
And look what I got, this is
collage of newspaper at the time.

267
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,377
Well, the weight is reduced very much.

268
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,321
And then he found 3 weeks
then, without a clear cause of death.

269
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:25,387
Unfortunately, he and his family wanted to destroy
The mirror before her death in 1885.

270
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,365
And after that, the mirror was missing.

271
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,266
No one knows where the loss.

272
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,295
And the latter case is
Mariana woman Bore,

273
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,330
He loved to spend
Her time in the bathroom.

274
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,537
He was found after three weeks
dead in the bathtub.

275
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:45,342
Well, the coroner's report states
the cause of death was dehydration.

276
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,352
The woman died from thirst for three days.

277
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:53,484
The next case is the death of the
occurs in a woman Olive Vanza.

278
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,291
Neighbors found him dead in
in the garden of his own house.

279
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,455
This picture was taken at the time of his death.

280
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:07,262
Olive Husband found here, while
he and his son are found in conditions
severe in the master bedroom.

281
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,298
Head and the bottom
separate body when found.

282
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,342
So also with her children.

283
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,335
While other parts of the body
not at all hurt.

284
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,242
Absolutely no.

285
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,473
Like nothing happened.

286
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:23,377
I will continue with other cases
happened to a girl on a farm.

287
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:27,255
He never recovered from his injuries, and
The farm has several dogs.

288
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,284
Including Shepard dog
Australia is still small.

289
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,431
Let's eat.

290
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,415
To whom did you make this video?

291
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,254
Everyone who was there.

292
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,413
Why?

293
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,221
Because children oppressors will know?

294
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,394
And you're afraid they'll leave you alone.

295
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,330
Because taking care of the problem mirrors.

296
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,368
Listen, Kaylie, we are just a small child.

297
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:17,274
It was just a scary story of the past,
and we do not need to seek the truth,
she did.

298
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,243
He is a crazy guy
who tortured and killed.

299
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,517
Call me crazy they pleased you.

300
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,357
But you should not be talking
about him like that.

301
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,491
Shawn Cath, 1955, was found dead in his bed.

302
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,466
And until now his death
remains a mystery.

303
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,436
And in '65, happen again.

304
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,439
Someone stated there
's wrong with this mirror.

305
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:52,273
Local officials declared him missing
after not heard the news from her.

306
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,245
And he found like this.

307
00:31:54,512 --> 00:32:00,348
And in this case there are witnesses who say
see the big black shadow into the
his room in Paris.

308
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:04,378
Evidence is found
and a small plastic bag of bloody pliers.

309
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,354
In 2002,

310
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,517
You can not distinguish the difference
between ilusinasi and Coronation.

311
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,288
I know the difference, thank you.

312
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,353
Well, I would say
if it's really weird.

313
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,457
Your grandfather say attack
heart while getting hit by a car.

314
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,264
And our cats escape.

315
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,271
How does it make sense to you?

316
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,465
Can I re--do this now?

317
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,241
Sure, let's do it, Kaylie.

318
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,467
Let's talk about why you're here.

319
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,405
Come on.

320
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,474
, 2002.

321
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:36,351
Last mirror holder is Alan Russell.

322
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,284
Awkward, is not it?

323
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,254
Husband to Marie.

324
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:46,423
Charged with murder
by reason of mental disorder,

325
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,366
and the torture and murder
in the family home.

326
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,389
I know.

327
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,265
By her husband.

328
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,439
That being said the police report.

329
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,308
And her husband was killed by his own son.

330
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,346
Right in front of the eyes of her daughter.

331
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:11,318
I just wanted to state that none of the
The people responsible for it,

332
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,259
Alan Russell is not a
perpetrator but a victim.

333
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:19,252
And he is the victim of force
supernatural that is in the mirror.

334
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,323
So why do not you
Just destroy the damn thing?

335
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,427
You do not remember it?

336
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,270
Considering what?

337
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,312
Please lah .. destroyed.

338
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,404
By all means.

339
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,319
Alright.

340
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,429
You know what happens to people
people are trying to destroy it.

341
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,533
And incidentally it matter
it happened to them.

342
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,403
The mind makes all kinds
beliefs on everyone.

343
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,316
And when it started pervasive belief,

344
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:16,252
mind takes information
randomized to strengthen it.

345
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:24,485
How many thousands of records that you combine
to support your case?

346
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,231
Why did not you destroy it?

347
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,273
-- Because I'm trying to talk to you.
-- Ah ..

348
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,505
And I know one person who
trying to destroy the mirror.

349
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,375
Oliver Jackrice.

350
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,475
1891, a teacher who gives
teaching at the Academy of Manhattan.

351
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:51,319
He tried to destroy these mirrors
was in the hall, but was never able to destroy her

352
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:57,316
According to the report, after which he walked
out the hall and died in the crash.

353
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,288
No one is able to destroy the mirror.

354
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,299
Just like the others.

355
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,237
You know why I do not
smash the mirror?

356
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:13,466
In addition you get fired or ..
trial for damaging property.

357
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,346
That's not my right.

358
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,440
Nothing can ruin
delusion it for you.

359
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,445
You have to do it yourself.

360
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,411
This is my way to do it.

361
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,323
You're looking at 25 pounds of a sharp knife.

362
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:34,265
Plus 25 pounds of ballast which is connected
with a modified automatic cable
with a kitchen timer.

363
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,392
Now timeliness is important,
and we got about 10 seconds longer.

364
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,460
Its timer runs every 30 minutes,

365
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,438
and if you do not stop,

366
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,310
be like that.

367
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,374
And if you do not want that to happen
again, we have to continue this.

368
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,413
You know how it was?

369
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,382
I guess it's like
gun pointed at your head.

370
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,290
And I expect it to make us more
desire to solve this case.

371
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:21,493
Hey, kids, come to my office for a while.

372
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:28,338
I think I've been pretty clear about
you should not be all sorts in here.

373
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,302
We did not.

374
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,400
I do not like in here.

375
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,375
All right, then what is?

376
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,316
We did not do that.

377
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,481
Ok, I trust you.

378
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:48,322
You know I can hear
if you all sorts here.

379
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,396
All children want to do, I
understand, I know this move is difficult.

380
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,357
It will not happen, ok?

381
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,336
If you all kinds that would be a problem.

382
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,307
You also have to remember that.

383
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,402
You know what dad's plan for me?

384
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,281
Saving water supply in the tank.

385
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,283
I seem to remember ever drank.

386
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:22,282
All that is said in front of the classroom,
about what is happening in the room.

387
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:27,230
Where there is a dead cat everywhere.

388
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,323
Plan wise.

389
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,365
Plan started in the living room,
live plants, plants that have a life.

390
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,310
-- You look cute by the way.
-- Come on, do not mess continues.

391
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,312
We must be serious.

392
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,311
I was also involved in this.

393
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,238
Dog?

394
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,251
Sorry, Dog.

395
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,422
Mineral water.

396
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,334
-- Come on, boy, come on Mason, go.
-- Go!

397
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,279
-- Mason, ran!
-- Wake up!

398
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,440
Go get it!

399
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,347
Come on, wake up!

400
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,379
You know the main reason I bought this is
because you are frightened and feel insecure.

401
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,224
-- Because you told me to see someone at the bottom.
-- But it makes me feel safer.

402
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,328
On the contrary, in fact ..

403
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:41,269
Ok, I will save and lock it,
perlurunya unload, until I'm sure
a time will be required at times of emergency.

404
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,376
Go to hell!

405
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,219
What did you just say to me?

406
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,479
I did not say anything.

407
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,258
Ah ..

408
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,418
Oh my God!

409
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,263
-- Alan!
-- I'm working!

410
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,244
With whom did you speak?

411
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,414
When are you going to do something
the damn dog?

412
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,521
There is something wrong with
The dog, Alan, he bit me!

413
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,463
Are you okay?

414
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,357
I'm fine.

415
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,365
You seem like lost in
own world in here.

416
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,272
I was not lost in the ..

417
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:45,326
Children? Listen, you have to
I provide special assistance
This day, I have an appointment with a client.

418
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:49,389
I will need you to
far away from my office, ok?

419
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,424
Ok, dad.

420
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,334
Well, I love you guys.

421
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,392
You want to come in?

422
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,521
Go and see what's inside.

423
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,496
Damn ..

424
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,382
Why we should not get in?
There must be something inside.

425
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:49,257
-- Hey, kids, why do you .. -- We must
do something about the damn dogs.

426
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,325
Well, a hello would be nice.

427
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,388
He was barking all day, I
should be locked in the office.

428
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,357
Reassure him.

429
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,407
Where is he?

430
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,324
-- Well, that's just it, you
one to remember. -- Not.

431
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,293
-- I'm not one to remember.
-- You're wrong ..

432
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,490
I still remember it
well, I can not be wrong.

433
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,397
-- Maybe you. -- Do you
Mason remembered until the end?

434
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,331
Munta throwing around the house.

435
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,429
I've merisetnya and
was due to a virus.

436
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:42,378
-- Oh my God. -- The virus that causes nausea--
nausea and eventually kills the plant.

437
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,310
Mason illness.

438
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,341
All right, I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow.

439
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,317
Bad news, I think we
both will not be back.

440
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,254
Mom, where Mason?

441
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,254
Ah, he is punished.

442
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,318
Are you sure remember it like it was?

443
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,454
Did you really say that?

444
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,428
Why not?

445
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,420
You are wrong.

446
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:05,526
I saw the mother put it in
office, and I sat in front of him all day and
no one in or out.

447
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,338
Have you ever studied human psychology?

448
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,273
No, I never heard of it.

449
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,300
I once read an article about it.

450
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,502
Our brain is actually a
code that captures and tracks.

451
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,311
More like, the ability
in receiving information ..

452
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:23,275
-- This is bullshit.
-- And save it to memory.

453
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,287
You see the mother enter the dog
us into the office a few times.

454
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,381
Oh my God, what are they doing to you.

455
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:32,226
Long before the father forbid entry to anyone
in the office, there are traces of it in your mind.

456
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,285
I feel sorry for you.

457
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,423
Ok, more like what exactly?

458
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:38,296
Remember something that you're wrong
which occurred eleven years ago?

459
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,268
Or about our dogs?

460
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,341
Oh look, it's Dog.

461
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,341
It's almost time.

462
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,375
Time is short.

463
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,387
You're late, you're not okay?

464
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,264
I'm not lying, I hear you
talk to someone.

465
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,269
Do you hear yourself,
I can hear you through the door?

466
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,498
Admit it!

467
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,369
I'm not crazy.

468
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,500
Then why are you fears, and
said there was a thief?

469
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,306
You've lost your senses!

470
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,210
Children.

471
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,380
I'm sorry I woke you.

472
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:37,489
Why do you continue to fight?

473
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,198
You know how the state
mother, you can see it.

474
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,325
I convinced myself I own
if I melhat many things.

475
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,397
But what do we see?

476
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,273
Mother yelling at dad in the middle of the night?

477
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,469
Mom says she heard
a voice from inside the office.

478
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,372
As I explain to myself I
itself, it is the sound of a window.

479
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,508
Why did you meet him?

480
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,477
First of all, we played in the park.

481
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,250
Does mother know?

482
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,517
Dad was always there at home.

483
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,289
Are you sure about that?

484
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,484
Because, I do not.

485
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,430
Quick, get out!

486
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,411
He had an affair, it is a wedding
bad, see how it ends.

487
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:30,380
No.

488
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,247
Our father was a carpenter
mother cheating and it makes us mad.

489
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:36,252
-- Stop it. -- He is not a person
holy as you remember.

490
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,345
Bad marriage.

491
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,447
Our mother is a good mother.

492
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:45,484
-- Shit .. -- A marriage
bad, we both see what
occur in the home that night.

493
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,293
She has a secret, a sign
of an illicit relationship.

494
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:56,228
Dad never showed signs of
if he had illicit relations.

495
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,467
He's smart and does not leave a trace.

496
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,474
Silence!

497
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,504
And he saw a
another woman, she's a ghost.

498
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,276
And yes I agree, it's strange and
many secrets. I'll find it.

499
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:08,375
I'll find him,
she is not like her!

500
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,286
What has happened to him?

501
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,359
I guess you do not understand what
we are debating.

502
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,262
Do you know the temperature decreased by 3 degrees here?

503
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,357
3 degrees.

504
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,266
In this small room, it bisasa
happens if there is electrical shorting.

505
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,328
Then why do not you just check it?

506
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,498
Okay, will check.

507
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,340
Is there anyone at home?

508
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,431
Nothing.

509
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,379
You can deal with this, I can.

510
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,382
Do you want to overcome this,
Do not betritahukan father and mother.

511
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:44,218
You're doing this for yourself.

512
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,516
Is not it a relief for you?

513
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,256
You are a person who does not have feelings.

514
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,365
I have to go back, go.

515
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,524
Shut up you basic, stupid dog!

516
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,298
Stop it! I'm done!

517
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,397
I know this house like you too.

518
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,464
I'm not going to say anything because
you torture a dog!

519
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,237
-- Stop it!
-- I'm going to release it.

520
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,211
Stop it, stop it!

521
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,310
No, no, wait!

522
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,518
What?

523
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,518
-- You do not know what you're doing.
-- Oh, Kelly, you're sick!

524
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,223
Nothing happened,
What you do not realize it?

525
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:30,324
The dog was still alive, the glass was not
pick it up. You're just imagining it!

526
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,497
And it's not your fault.

527
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,432
You're just scared.

528
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,467
I assisted and you're just alone.

529
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,446
This is not something that should be avoided.

530
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,512
It is in our family.

531
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,319
Kaylie, I'm sorry.

532
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,431
Listen ...

533
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,427
let's get out of here.

534
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:10,304
Go somewhere else and talk about it.

535
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:31,327
Where should we go?

536
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,362
Oh, Kaylie ...

537
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,300
Let's go to a place
to calm yourself.

538
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,295
Where no one will disturb.

539
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,278
We will overcome them.

540
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,509
There must be people who will help you.

541
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,335
Kaylie?

542
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,307
Finally ...

543
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,379
Finally.

544
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,505
Yes!

545
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,212
Yes, yes!

546
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,482
Yes, yes!

547
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,357
And what would you say again?

548
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,336
He had an affair, that's what actually happened.

549
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:25,307
And you believe all
crazy things he says.

550
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,471
-- You are my son.
-- Yes, and I would never do that.

551
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,276
I never doubted it.

552
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:35,479
Yes, he can not be trusted,
but how can you like it?

553
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,216
Do you believe it now, is not it?

554
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:43,486
Great, now we'll keep an eye on
temperature changes occur.

555
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,484
We'll find him.

556
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,259
We never learn in school.

557
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,257
We must gather enough evidence.

558
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,359
Do not do this.

559
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:56,361
Team, we talked about this.

560
00:52:56,373 --> 00:53:00,207
I know this is difficult for you to do.

561
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:05,403
Hello?

562
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:09,249
Hi, yes. I'll be there now.

563
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:13,218
I'm sorry about it
it, I'll see you soon.

564
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,417
He asked how the results.

565
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,395
We have to leave this room for a while.

566
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,299
We have to do much else.

567
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,274
Where do these things?

568
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,308
30 feet in length.

569
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:39,339
We have to measure it from here to the garage.

570
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:44,251
From the master bedroom to the yard,
and back. It was very long.

571
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,313
Tim ...

572
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,515
Team!

573
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:56,494
Your call is being transferred,
please try again.

574
00:53:56,499 --> 00:54:01,493
Your call is being transferred,
please try again.

575
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,473
Your call is being transferred,

576
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:07,305
Tim ...

577
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,346
Team.

578
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,253
How did I get here?

579
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,288
What are you talking about? You
out here and you're sitting.

580
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,451
-- I was outside.
-- Not.

581
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:26,451
Are you really out there?
Let's say in front of the camera.

582
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,228
Hey, hey!

583
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,465
If it is true, I want to know when.

584
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,235
Do you hear me?

585
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,401
Do you understand?

586
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,486
Where father, mother?

587
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,488
I do not know.

588
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,252
You do not know where my father is?

589
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,488
I do not know where he is.

590
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,320
I just know where he
be appropriate to say.

591
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,240
Kaylie ...

592
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,508
What is he doing there?

593
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,487
I did not meet him.

594
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,329
I see him.

595
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,356
Be quiet.

596
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,269
When?

597
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,375
Overnight.

598
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:28,508
He is in a healthy state.

599
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,454
He's not crazy.

600
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,356
What did he do?

601
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:39,260
I do not know.

602
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,525
It was weird.

603
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:46,334
Maybe he does not realize it.

604
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,239
He wants to stay here.

605
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,474
He's not welcome here.

606
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,399
Mother?

607
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,402
Mom!

608
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,310
Release him!

609
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,308
Not!

610
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,315
Run!

611
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,353
Quick, quick!

612
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,359
Mom, stop it!

613
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,321
Marrie?

614
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,293
Hey, hey!

615
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,297
What are you doing?

616
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,361
You did nothing?

617
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,308
You guys have done it.

618
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,437
-- Whether the mother is okay?
-- Mom is okay.

619
01:01:56,512 --> 01:02:02,246
In just fainted she does nothing,
you go in and close the door.

620
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,427
Yes, if you can come here?

621
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,273
-- Please do not go.
-- You're not anything.

622
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,261
You're not anything.

623
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,194
We'll be fine.

624
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,454
Team.

625
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,392
Wake up!

626
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,294
AKu here.

627
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:29,463
Are you all right?

628
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,242
Okay ..

629
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,257
Your mother is quite ill.

630
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:04,337
And now we have to
soon forget it.

631
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:08,400
When he recovered later,
he could catch up with us.

632
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,304
Why?

633
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,513
So, Tim, Kaylie ..

634
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:23,414
We should always stay away from the room
it, do you understand?

635
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,295
What's in there?

636
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,268
Yes ..

637
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:39,407
You do not want to harm us all right.

638
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,399
But I need your cooperation.

639
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:45,413
Does no one
that help us?

640
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:56,413
Here you are.

641
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,229
I saved it under.

642
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,255
Team!

643
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,392
Tim, realized!

644
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,251
Team!

645
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,274
Can anyone help me?

646
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,367
What?

647
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,300
No nothing.

648
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,253
Clearly there is something wrong here.

649
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,267
Come on, Kaylie ..

650
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:43,213
There is no food anywhere, yeah.

651
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,445
What is the problem?

652
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,447
-- We have not eaten.
-- Later.

653
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,326
We were already hungry.

654
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,293
What is the importance?

655
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,327
We need to call for help for mom!

656
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,446
This is stupid.

657
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,323
We will break down the door.

658
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,449
-- But dad ..
-- I do not care what the father said.

659
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,281
Mother?

660
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,388
He had to be taken away.

661
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:40,328
-- You told me he ..
-- That's your problem if you do not think!

662
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:45,432
I told you not to go into
the room, but you still get in, why?!

663
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,275
You shut your mouth.

664
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:55,309
You stop scaring discouraged
brother and close your mouth.

665
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,318
You're not anything.
Are you okay?

666
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,226
Dah!

667
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,363
What did he say?

668
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,296
He said we had to call for help.

669
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:23,273
We will ask for the help of anyone?

670
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,442
I also do not know.

671
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,419
I do not know.

672
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,306
Hi, how are you?

673
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:02,306
I'm really sorry,
but your son ask me here.

674
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:07,288
Did you know? It all brings
we're here, I mean, he ..

675
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,224
You know, this is the feeling of a mother ..

676
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,487
As a mother.

677
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,428
Well, this is nothing.

678
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:18,233
Well, I'm sorry
what happened to you.

679
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,292
I hope everything will be better soon.

680
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,360
Thank you.

681
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:26,502
And what do you know? How
with plans next week?

682
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,204
Nice! Do it.

683
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:30,472
-- See you later!
-- Be careful.

684
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,304
Come on ..

685
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:03,344
We have to be really ready.

686
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,255
That's it ..

687
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,416
Team!

688
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,329
Marie?

689
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:44,278
How do we counteract this?

690
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,473
But this is okay.

691
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,522
This is it.

692
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,366
Dad?

693
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,313
Fix the lamp.

694
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:40,257
The trick is this?

695
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:05,411
What the hell?

696
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,291
I killed him ..

697
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:40,479
Hello?

698
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:43,423
How is she?

699
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:49,423
I'm fine.

700
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:54,198
Okay. I'll see one
hours. I'm talking.

701
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,465
That's the trick.

702
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,444
I did not kill him, I
not possible to do it.

703
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,446
Plate, it's not real.

704
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:09,281
I did not kill him, because
plate instead of a real plate!

705
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:34,399
Not!

706
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,320
Michael!

707
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:49,482
What to do?

708
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,322
Oh no ..

709
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:59,232
Let's get out of here.

710
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,303
Hello?

711
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:15,339
I need the police to come to my house.

712
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:17,478
Okay. Alright.

713
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,287
The police are on their way.
They will solve this problem.

714
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,381
Kaylie!

715
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,221
We did nothing!

716
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,385
We did nothing!

717
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,362
-- Come on!
-- All right, all right.

718
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:31,264
-- But we should go back inside.
-- No. ..

719
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,268
-- No. ..
-- The mechanism, we can not leave it.

720
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:37,237
All you have to do is
wait, no more than half an hour.

721
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:38,399
Pemicumu Tool!

722
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,499
-- We have to take it.
-- Yes!

723
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,477
We're done. It's over.

724
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:46,345
We have to stay here and
watch the thing die.

725
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:12,272
Did you see them?

726
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,532
Did you see them there?

727
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,444
-- Let us seek the help!
-- Wait a minute!

728
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:33,255
-- Did you call for help?
-- Yes, I waited in front of my house.

729
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,320
You came out and now you're calling.

730
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:41,394
But that is not useful, but it
useless, but it's useless.

731
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,427
Pity you.

732
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:51,472
We have to do it.

733
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,443
We can not do anything.

734
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,511
-- Wait for it.
-- But it's no use.

735
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:03,247
But we face is very .. very strange.

736
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,456
You will continue here? We have to get out.

737
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,431
Yes, we must destroy it.

738
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,461
Now what?

739
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:26,440
I already told
you to go from here.

740
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,305
What?

741
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,528
Shh!

742
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:32,355
Kylie?

743
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,361
What happened?

744
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,371
You still have not noticed?

745
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,302
There is a figure being up there.

746
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,472
You're acting weird and scary outside.

747
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:52,216
That's our target creature,
we should get out of here.

748
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,244
I do not know where to go anymore.

749
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:56,348
We will, I promise.

750
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:57,449
And you have to ..

751
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:03,328
Team.

752
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,366
What should we do now?

753
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:40,494
He's down there.

754
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:44,336
-- Is he going to kill us?
-- We have to get out of here.

755
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:47,535
-- How do I?
-- We had to go without his knowledge.

756
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:51,239
Do you want to continue to be up here?

757
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,315
-- What can we do?
-- We run alone.

758
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,314
Are you ready?

759
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:06,293
-- Not.
-- We have to get out of here.

760
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:08,429
We ran down there.

761
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,333
We have to get out of here.

762
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:17,303
Yes, I think you're right.

763
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,206
Are you ready?

764
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:26,407
I promise you we can definitely do this.

765
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,438
You should be able to do it.

766
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,263
What will we do now?

767
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,470
I will not give up.

768
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,248
You want me to leave you like that?

769
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:15,379
No.

770
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:37,470
Do you hear me?

771
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,496
Team.

772
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,423
Stay away, stay away from me.

773
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:33,324
No, do not come any closer!

774
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:14,468
Kaylie.

775
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:18,504
Hurry.

776
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:24,511
Run!

777
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,432
Open the door!

778
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:51,496
See!

779
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:56,503
The whole place is

780
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,274
It will not end.

781
01:31:58,379 --> 01:32:01,246
I think I've said
you not to be here.

782
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:16,296
Please, it's not you.

783
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:18,457
This is me.

784
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,435
I consciously do this.

785
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:26,433
I do not want you here.

786
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:29,402
She is me.

787
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,323
Release him!

788
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,232
Run.

789
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:34,340
No, no!

790
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:37,240
Father.

791
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,412
Run! Quickly run!

792
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:15,379
Kaylie!

793
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:19,377
Kaylie.

794
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,459
Kaylie.

795
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,209
Mother.

796
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:50,502
Tim, is that you?

797
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,280
I want you to promise
me you will stay strong.

798
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:58,417
Do not ever be afraid.

799
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,417
You have to get through this.

800
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:12,228
For mom and dad.

801
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,303
I promise.

802
01:36:28,315 --> 01:36:31,375
Kaylie. This is me.

803
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:34,312
No.

804
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:40,259
Kaylie! Kaylie up! Kaylie!

805
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:44,260
Kaylie! Help me!

806
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:46,266
Hear me!

807
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:22,265
-- He who contacted us?
-- Yes, he called 911.

808
01:37:22,403 --> 01:37:24,462
And this is what happened.

809
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:32,472
You'll take me where?

810
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:36,249
Kaylie, this is not my fault.

811
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:38,382
Do not take it, stop it!

812
01:37:38,385 --> 01:37:40,285
Stop it!

813
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:43,347
I did not do!
I did not do!

814
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:45,221
I did not do!

815
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:47,250
Do not take me, not me who did it.

816
01:37:47,328 --> 01:37:50,229
Not me! I did not do!

817
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,234
It was not my fault!

818
01:37:55,269 --> 01:37:56,429
I did not do!

819
01:37:56,503 --> 01:38:00,371
Do not be afraid, do not forget your promise.

820
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:05,278
Do not forget your promise.
