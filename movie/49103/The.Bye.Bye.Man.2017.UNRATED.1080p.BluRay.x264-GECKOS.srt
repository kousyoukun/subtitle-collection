tell anyone that.

about you, though.

laughed at you before,
but that's not funny.

to protect you now.

one by one,
away from this wall?

you'd say it's still a wall.

I know your husband
killed a lot of people.

01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,121
ButldonW

I need your help,
whatever you remember.

973
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,886
There's a train, gold coins...

974
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,641
A hound...

975
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,446
He came to Larry.

(SIGHS) With the hound.

977
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,481
What Larry told me
gave me nightmares.

978
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,971
I made him stop.

979
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,841
I understand.

980
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,762
But I need you to tell me
everything Larry said.

981
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,606
Please.

982
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,124
Larry was on
a story of a teenager
who killed his family.

983
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,846
Poked around like
a good nosy reporter
and heard rumors...

984
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,486
Whispers about an evil,

985
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,167
some kind of a reaper
that drove the teenager mad.

986
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,811
Larry had to go nosing around
and writing it down.

987
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,891
<i>And then it
came to Larry, too,</i>

988

That's what I do.
I track down the story.

See...

1006
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,846
Once you know his name,
you can't escape him.

1007
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,491
You see,
he gets in your head and...

1008
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,561
He makes you do
horrible things.

1009
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,210
Okay. Okay. (SHUSHING)

1010
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,362
What horrible things?

1011
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,647
Who makes you do this?
What are you talking about?

1012

Let's get you to bed,
okay, sweetheart?

1013
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,808
Listen. Listen, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.

1014
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,525
And then the hound...

1015
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,011
That's how you
know he's coming.

1016
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,367
When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,

1017
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,204
that's when you
know he's close by.

I don't know what's happened,
but I'm trying...

1021
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,605
He listens for his name.

1022
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,842
Anyone could say it.
It could be you.

1023
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,081
Or it could be me.

1024
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,121
And it's just dumb luck
like the flip of a coin.

1025
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,242
And I heard the name
and I told Janey the name.

Don't say it."

The more scared we are,
the more real he gets.

We make him more powerful.

Yeah, we give him the power
