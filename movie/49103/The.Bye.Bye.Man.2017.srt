2
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,990
Jane!

3
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,990
Jane!

4
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,600
Jane, it's me! Open up.

5
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,450
Did you tell anyone?

6
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,630
Did I...

7
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,680
About the name.
The name?

8
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,280
Yeah, I told Rick.
He thought it was funny.

9
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,240
Just Rick and nobody else?

10
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,600
No.

11
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,080
Why, what's the matter?

12
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,960
Larry, what's wrong?

13
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,640
You have no idea how sorry I am.

15
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,880
Larry, you're scaring me.

16
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,600
What are you doing?

17
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,400
Rick!

18
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,720
Ricky!

19
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,040
Rick, the name!

20
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,520
Janey!

21
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,200
Did you tell
anyone? Anyone!

22
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,070
Larry, please,
please! I...

23
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,200
Rick, he's coming!

24
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,560
The name!

25
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,960
Giselle. I told Giselle!

26
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,960
I'm going to stop you!

27
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,080
Giselle!

28
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,400
- Larry...
- Mom!

29
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,960
Who did you tell?

30
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,520
He killed them!

31
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,680
Don't think it.

32
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,220
- Mom, come on!
- Don't say it.

33
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:08,440
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

34
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,270
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

35
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,040
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

36
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,520
Giselle! Did you say the name?

37
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,880
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

38
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,590
Don't say it.

39
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,030
Don't say it.

40
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,640
Who did you say
the name to, Giselle?

41
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,040
What the hell are you...

42
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,240
Larry!

43
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,520
What's up, playboy?

44
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,920
How's it going?
Good.

45
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,880
Today is a good day.

46
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,310
You got the key?
No, it's under the mat.

47
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,410
Oh! Come on.

48
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,840
It's only 20 minutes.

49
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,000
This is the first time he's rented the
place. The guy says it's fantastic.

50
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,980
What else would he say,
"It's a dog house"?

51
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,820
No, I'm trying to convince her,
let's go. Come on, man, work with me.

52
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,880
- Sash?
- Yeah. I'm up for it.

53
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,720
It's a little creepy. Right?

54
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,320
Nah, it's just cold.

55
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,230
Heat's off.

56
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,440
I've got to piss
like a race horse.

57
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,760
Cute.

58
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,560
Dude, this place is sweet, bro.

59
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,230
Hey.

60
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,070
Right?

61
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,850
We could put
the desk over there.

62
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,200
We could put the bed here.

63
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,160
Well, maybe if there was a bed.

64
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,480
I know, the landlord said
it was fully furnished.

65
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,360
Yo, El, come and check this out, man.
This is crazy.

66
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,480
Come on down.

67
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,760
Yo, El, come in here, man.

68
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,920
See, you can't get this
in the dorms, right?

69
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,080
Now, that's classic.

70
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,520
John, you really think Sasha
wants to see that, or that?

71
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,320
You got the whole upstairs
to make girly, okay?

72
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,550
I've definitely seen bigger.
See? You're awesome.

73
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,560
Bro, she's awesome, man.

74
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,510
Oh, yeah, you guys must've
been hilarious when you were young.

75
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,280
"Must've been"? Are.

76
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,040
Tier 1.

77
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,960
Hey, he made me look smart,
and I made him look ugly.

78
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,000
But after the crash,
he took care of me.

79
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,320
Talk shit about my
boy's folks, you're done.

80
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,320
Okay, when
the Tier 1 s are both ready

81
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,680
to cook and clean and help me
do this place up right.

82
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,600
'Cause I'm not going
to be your guys' maid.

83
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,320
Of course not.
I told him. Right?

84
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,250
Well, I never cooked you
my butter pasta-nette.

85
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,200
That is not a thing.

86
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,480
That's 'cause I invented it.
Okay.

87
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,840
And I clean, too.

88
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,280
I promise.

89
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,550
Yo, what does this do?

90
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,680
Yeah, you cook.

91
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,200
Yes, I cook, okay?
I don't bake.

92
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,490
Found the furniture.

93
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,600
I've heard about
you and all the girls.

94
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,150
And that's exactly why we
need to get out of the dorms.

95
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,270
This is perfect.

96
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,200
Whoa. Easy.

97
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,720
You all right?

98
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,800
Yeah, thanks.

99
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,400
So, it looks like
the landlord wasn't lying.

100
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,880
Wow.

101
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,120
Damn, son.

102
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,400
Hey, I like this.

103
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,090
Ow. Fuck.

104
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,480
So?

105
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,790
Don't you want to?

106
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,680
Well, yeah, yeah.
I do. Now I know you...

107
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,120
Yo, all the dishes in here,
they're white.

108
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,450
Just saying.

109
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,080
He touches everything.

110
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,390
It's up to you, Bear.

111
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,060
I can't afford it without him.
I know you can, but I don't...

112
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,360
Elliot. Elliot.

113
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,840
Yeah?
We're doing it. Obviously.

114
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,440
Yeah?
Yeah.

115
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,240
I see she approves, huh?

116
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,920
Hey, you need a hand?
No, I got this.

117
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,800
Okay, don't break yourself.
Better than going to the gym, right?

118
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,200
Hey, Elliot?
Yeah?

119
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,880
Hey, did you hear that banging?
Yeah.

120
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,680
The radiators sound worse.

121
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,480
Okay, Bear, here it is.

122
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,240
Rilke says, "Coins symbolize the
wonder and terror of fortune.

123
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,080
"Do you land face up
or face down in the dirt?

127
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm wiped.

128
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,990
Hmm.

129
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,680
Thanks for
finding me that quote.

130
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,960
You wanna watch
something stupid?

131
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,530
Mmm-hmm.

132
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,960
Just us, yeah.

133
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

134
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,720
Hey, what's on the bed?

135
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,920
"You look like
a model from the '70s.

Elliot?

148
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,070
Hey.

149
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,000
What's wrong?

150
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,440
Hey!

151
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,110
What's up, man?

152
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,540
Oh, Little brother!
How's it going?

153
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,770
Look at this place. Fantastic.

154
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,000
Hi, darling.
Hey.

155
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,040
Hi, Uncle Elliot!

156
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,040
Hey, Niece Alice!
Hey, hey.

157
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,210
Hey, there.
Hey.

158
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,750
Sorry we're so early,
your brother's pathological.

159
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,800
It's called being
prompt and professional.

160
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,480
Virgil's awesome.
Thank you.

161
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,880
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

162

Here's your
housewarming present.

163
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,760
You going to help me drink it?

No!

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,080
Look at this.

166
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,110
So, a house off-campus with John
Henry and a live-in girlfriend.

167
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,270
You ready for this?

168
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,080
She's the one, Virgil.

169
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,760
She did all this herself.

170
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,840
That's great, it's just,
you know... Be smart.

171
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,480
Be a student, man.

172
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,480
It's the last time to have no
responsibilities. Enjoy it.

173
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,400
I don't want that.
I want what you have.

174
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,950
An amazing wife,
an amazing daughter.

175
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,320
Well, just don't rush it.

176
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,960
That's all out
there waiting for you.

177
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,960
Believe me,
what I have is great. It is.

178
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,880
But I missed out on all this.

179
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,000
I mean, what a college edu-ma-cation
could have done for me.

180
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,680
You have a scholarship, man.

181
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,520
You should be
upstairs studying right now.

182
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,720
Jesus. It's a good
thing you're not jealous.

183
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,810
It is good.

184
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,540
Come on, man,
you got this. You got this!

185
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,580
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

186
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,800
All right, all right.

187
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,590
Baby!

188
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,400
Bam!
Thank you! Thank you!

189
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,720
An oldy-old
gold coin, huh?

190
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,840
Yeah, I put it back on the
little table next to the bed.

191
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,070
I didn't want to keep it.

192
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,840
It's 'cause you're the best,
most honest,

193
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,520
smartest, cutest, heaviest,
oldest person here.

194
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,070
I'm not the heaviest,
or the oldest.

195
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,780
Dad's the oldest
and he's the heaviest.

196
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,950
What?

197
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,920
She ratted me out.

198
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,680
Here.

199
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,040
Head-bump.

200
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,880
Fist-bump.

201
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,880
That's John's room,
we're upstairs.

202
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,410
All right, we're out of here.

203
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,600
Buddy, great party.

204
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,800
Be good.

205
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,720
Bye, guys. Bye, Alice.

206
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,280
Kim? She's in my Lit class.

207
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,120
Girls who wear hats inside are crazy,
you know that, right?

208
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,570
She's going to do a psychic
cleansing after everyone leaves.

209
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,720
Cool, can I leave, too?
No.

210
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,480
She's just gonna burn some sage,
and you are going to be nice.

211
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,920
Maybe you need a hat.

212
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,110
It's a twist-off.

213
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,560
Oh, thank you.

214
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,640
John, do you think
this house is creepy?

215
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,040
Mmm.
Yup.

216
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,080
I don't, but I'm not a girl.

217
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,160
And I think you should get dressed,
'cause we're playing baseball.

218
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,560
Why do jocks always have to
play games, even at a party?

219
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,800
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

220
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,000
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

221
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,200
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

222
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,400
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

223
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,880
"Don't say it.
Don't think it."

224
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,880
Miss Sasha steps
up to the plate.

225
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,920
She's going long!
She's going long!

226
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,040
Okay, all right, all right.
You got this?

227
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,160
All right.

228
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,560
Oh! Yes!

229
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,720
Oh, you all right?
Yeah.

230
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,870
You're drunk.

231
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,520
So, you thought
there were sounds and what?

232
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,560
"Bad vibrations"?
Yeah.

233
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,000
And now if they're gone,
then what's the big deal?

234
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,160
We burned all that
bad shit away, right?

235
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,360
That's tight.

236
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,040
You're actually psychic?

237
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,560
Sensitive, my mother says.

238
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,650
Oh, "Sensitive," huh?

239
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,480
So, what, your mom locked you under
the stairs when you were a kid?

240
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,710
You shoot knives at her.

241
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,520
Yeah. No.

242
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,840
But I could find stuff.

243
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,130
I always knew when people were
coming over to the house.

244
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,080
You know what I'm thinking?

245
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,800
Yes. I might just do that.

246
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,000
Damn, you are psychic.

247
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,320
Sensitive there, for sure.

248
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,360
Elliot...
It's okay, Sasha.

249
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,600
People have
doubted me my whole life.

250
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,000
Elliot, you can go ahead

251
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,120
and live a sheltered, shallow,
physical existence.

252
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,840
Well, a non-physical existence
would be kind of tough.

253
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,230
What Aristotle is
trying to say is...

254
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,560
Well, he needs proof.

255
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,240
Yeah, is that crazy?

256
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,560
Okay, let's just
take some deep breaths.

257
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,650
Okay.

258
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,440
So, if nothing happens,
I should believe, 'cause it means

259
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,750
you got rid of the spirit.

260
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,240
Elliot, come on.
What?

261
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,290
We all know you don't believe
in this stuff, okay?

262
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,320
But can you just
please let her do it?

263
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,520
Right. Sorry.
No being rational.

264
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,750
I give over. I do.

265
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,230
Yo, El, just loosen up
the grip a little bit,

266
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm trying to
concentrate on my breathing.

267
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,840
Are you ready, ladies?

268
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,680
Okay, let's do
this thing. Come on.

269
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,680
Now, I have no ego about it,
but I do know this stuff.

270
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,320
Okay, cool.
Well, what do you know?

271
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,560
Okay.

272
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,200
I know your
parents died in a crash.

273
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,950
Dude...

274
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,640
He didn't tell me.

275
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,730
They did.

276
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,360
Bro, I didn't say anything.
Swear.

277
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,730
I would never tell anyone that.

278
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,880
They're worried
about you, though.

279
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,280
All right, I'm sorry I laughed at
you before, but that's not funny.

280
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm not being funny, Elliot.
This is just what I'm getting.

281
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,360
Okay, how did they die?

282
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,000
What kind of accident was it?

283
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,400
Your brother will do anything in
his power to protect you now.

284
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,040
But they worry that
he's taking on too much.

285
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,720
All right. So, you talked
to my brother tonight.

286
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,430
Sasha, your...

287
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,240
Your grandmother has some
biscuits or rolls or something.

288
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,790
Gam's Rolls?

289
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,800
Come on, everybody's grandma
bakes biscuits.

290
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,160
Yeah.
He's not wrong about that.

291
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,550
This is...
This is... You know what?

292
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,920
You want to blindfold me, too?

293
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,090
Just hang on.

294
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,840
I'll take you up
on that, though.

295
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,180
I'm all down for
the blindfolding,

296
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,880
whatever you got...
Of course.

297
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,080
Okay, what'd I hide?
Where'd I hide it?

298
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,640
Oh, come on. That's crazy.
Elliot...

299
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,000
Shh.

300
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,960
You know what? I...

301
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,560
I don't like this.

302
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,520
Yeah, I don't want
to do this anymore.

303
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,600
Maybe this was a bad idea.

304
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,910
Nah, come on.

305
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,520
You're a good faker, I admit it.

306
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,680
You put the keys in
a pot on the stove.

307
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,490
Did you?

308
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,010
You heard.

309
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,330
You were listening
for it, weren't you?

310
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,720
Well,
I didn't hear that, did you?

311
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,840
No.

312
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,280
- Something's coming.
- What?

313
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,200
They're saying,

314
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,200
"Don't...

315
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,480
"Don't think it.

316
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,550
"Don't say it.

317
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,320
"Don't say it. Don't think it.

318
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,800
"Don't say it. Don't think it.

319
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,880
"Don't say it! Don't think it!

320
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,870
"Don't say it! Don't think it!
Don't say it! Don't think it!

321
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,190
"Don't say it!
Don't think it!"

322
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,560
Don't say or think what?

323
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,360
The Bye Bye Man.

324
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,760
Jesus! What the fuck?

325
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,200
Kim! Oh, my God.

326
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,290
Hey...

327
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,190
What happened, Kim?
Kim?

328
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,640
Are you all right?

329
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,520
Sorry.
What are you doing?

330
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,880
Nothing. Nothing. Sorry.

331
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,440
Are you sick?

332
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,440
Good night. Love you.

333
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,960
I love you, John.

334
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,390
What?

335
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,840
Hey. You're joking, right?

336
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,240
Sasha, you're kidding, right?

337
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,080
What?

338
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,760
What the hell is that?

339
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,170
Come on!

340
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,920
John, let's go!

341
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,760
Look, I'm trying...

342
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,880
Like this?

343
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,730
Hey.

344
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,270
Shh.

345
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,920
What are you doing?
Do you hear that?

346
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,400
What the hell is that?

347
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,000
You ready?

348
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,710
Thanks for being
nice to me last night.

349
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,870
That was pretty crazy.

350
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,640
It was. Definitely.

351
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,680
You want to go inside?

352
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,720
My roommate's car isn't here.

353
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,800
We could try again.

354
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,160
These things happen, right?

355
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,720
Actually, not to me, they don't.

356
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,550
Yeah.

357
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,080
Actually, not to me, either.

358
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,320
A guy not finishing up, I've
never had that happen before.

359
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,410
Come on.

360
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,880
I'm hungry.

361
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,520
Jesus.

362
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,690
What?

363
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,410
Nothing.

364
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,480
Nothing, okay?

365
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,290
Kim, I need to go.

366
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,040
Now.

367
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,200
Fuck.

368
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,080
Dude, check this out.

369
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,800
They were already there, right?

370
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,010
No.

371
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,560
It was Colin or one of
those douches from last night.

372
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,280
No, listen, I heard it.

373
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,400
I heard something after the
party outside, scratching.

374
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,920
What do you mean,
you heard something?

375
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,830
Morning.

376
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,040
See, you are
clean and beautiful.

377
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,200
That's nice.

378
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,510
What was that?

379
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,640
John, you drive Kim home?
Yeah.

380
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,240
And now I gotta wash her off.

381
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,320
The girl's gross, man.
Total pig.

382
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,450
Come on, man, that's not cool.
Don't say that.

383
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,220
Oh, sure, yeah,
it's easy for you to say.

384
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,080
Your girlfriend is perfect.

385
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,480
Oh, God.

386
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,920
You okay?

387
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,000
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't
be playing baseball in the cold.

388
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,810
That's the problem
with being an alcoholic.

389
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,640
Oh, shut up, I didn't
even drink that much.

390
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,440
Maybe that was the mistake.

391
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,240
I'll make you some tea.

392
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,010
Come on.

393
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,520
Fuck him.

394
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,520
Bear, you went away
there for a second.

395
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,470
I did?

396
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,280
Yeah. Where'd you go?

397
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,430
God, you're shivering.

398
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,200
I was just thinking.

399
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,350
About John?

400
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,220
No, little brother, it's cool.

401
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,840
You can call me any time,
you know that.

402
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,490
Are you really
taking on too much?

403
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,240
Are you worried
about protecting me?

404
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,960
What is going on?

405
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,190
Is it Sasha?

406
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,160
Yeah, she's been
really sick and scared.

407
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,560
And John's been acting weird.

408
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,600
You guys seemed
like you were great.

409
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,040
Were we? You saw
them dancing together.

410
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,720
Talk to me,
buddy, what's going on?

411
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,640
Elliot?

412
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,670
What?

413
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,530
You wanna go get lunch
tomorrow or something,

414
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,880
we'll talk about this then?

415
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,320
You know what,
listen, I gotta go.

416
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,720
There's something I gotta...

417
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,800
I gotta deal with something.

418
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,470
El...

419
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,000
Guys?

420
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,080
Guys,
what are you doing up there?

421
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,680
Hello? Anyone down there?

422
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,350
Hello?

423
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,230
Hello?

424
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,880
Guys! Help!

425
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,600
No!

426
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,750
Guys!

427
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,320
What are you doing, Elliot?

428
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,070
You were here the whole time?
Yes.

429
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,230
That's bullshit.

430
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,720
But we were, Elliot.

431
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,080
You didn't answer me.

432
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,550
We didn't hear you!
What were you doing?

433
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,920
Studying, talking...

434
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,890
You didn't hear me? You didn't hear me?
We weren't doing anything.

435
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,840
Elliot, for the last time, bro,
we wouldn't do that to you!

436
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,070
Why are you lying to me?

437
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,230
We're not!
Jesus Christ.

438
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,490
Then what just happened, huh?

439
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,430
And there were sounds...
I mean, come on!

440
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,480
I told you there was
something happening.

441
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,080
Now do you believe me?

442
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,720
Hey, don't worry, okay?

443
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,130
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

444
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,230
Don't do what?
Don't...

445
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,700
Elliot... No, no, no.
Don't touch her.

446
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,760
What?
Don't touch her!

447
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,440
You are a crazy paranoid, bro!

448
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,240
Yeah, you're a little warm.

449
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,350
Okay, so you weren't with John.

450
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,400
Am I hearing things?
Am I seeing things?

451
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:19,550
Tonight you thought the house
was empty when we were here.

452
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,040
You went away, Elliot.

453
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,920
I kind of went away, too.

454
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,720
What?

455
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,640
I sat down to study...

456
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,200
I don't remember
doing any of that.

457
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,920
It's like now
that I know his name,

458
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,200
he's coming for me.

459
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,360
And the more I try to get rid
of it, the bigger it gets.

460
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,430
It's horrible.

461
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,800
Hey, babe.

462
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,360
Bye Bye Man's not real.

463
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,720
It's just something
that's in our heads.

464
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,960
That's real.

465
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,920
Ideas are real.

466
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,280
If it's not,

467
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,360
then, Elliot, we're all losing
our minds at the same time.

468
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,950
And what are
the chances of that?

469
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,110
What the hell is that?
What is it?

470
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,510
What...

471
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,960
Elliot, there's nothing here.

472
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,200
So, you're not
going to be late, right?

473
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:56,320
No, I'll meet you at 2:00 sharp,
right where we parked.

474
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,360
I'm going to find out how real
this thing is. The name...

475
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,020
You're going to talk to the
landlord about the furniture?

476
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,440
And the house.

477
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,960
Maybe he can
find somewhere else.

478
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,640
You're feeling better, though?

479
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:11,920
I guess.

480
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,720
It's hard to be scared
in the middle of the day.

481
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,160
I'm going to take care of you.

482
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,200
Oh, my God.

483
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,320
You're shivering.

484
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,600
I'm going to figure
this out, I promise.

485
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,280
I'll see you at 2:00.

486
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,800
I love you.

487
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:38,280
"Register Archive.
Dead File 69. Redmon."

488
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,160
Here, put these on.

489
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,240
- Really?
- Yeah.

490
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,040
They're originals
and we don't want

491
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,440
your sweaty palms messing up
the documents in the box.

492
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,040
Now, the dead file
has dead articles,

493
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,440
material that got
killed before going to press,

494
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,070
but still saved for posterity.
And it was written by Redmon.

495
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,840
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

496
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,160
Thank you, Dennis.

497
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,760
Mr. Daizy?
Yes, how are you doing?

498
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,640
Not so great, actually.

499
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,080
Uh, me and my friends

500
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,520
are renting your place

501
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,880
out in Sun Prairie.
37 Oakdale.

502
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,960
Oh, yeah, the two handsome guys.

503
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,110
Are you with them?

504
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,890
You have a weird house,
Mr. Daizy.

505
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,320
Really, it's awful.

506
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,520
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that
way, but they did sign a lease.

507
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:58,960
Bless you.

508
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,190
Sorry.

509
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,360
You okay?
It's really cold in here.

510
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,880
It's a hothouse. It's actually
not cold at all, honey.

511
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,440
Maybe you should be home in bed?

512
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,440
Look, Mr. Daizy.

513
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,600
There was an old nightstand
in the basement.

514
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,600
And it has this
writing inside it.

515
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,200
Where did it come from?

516
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,880
A nightstand?

517
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,400
Let's begin by
considering this wall...

518
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,400
Now, we can all agree
that the sentence...

519
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,280
Sorry.
Yeah, have a seat.

520
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,120
Now, we can all
agree that this sentence,

521
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,910
"This is a wall,"
is a truth claim.

522
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,950
This wall is real.
I see it, you see it.

523
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,440
We can touch it.

524
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:52,390
Likewise, if I were to brush
a few atoms from this wall,

525
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,870
it would still be here.
It would still be here before us.

526
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,120
It would still be "the wall."

527
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,640
But what if I continued

528
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,720
to slowly brush the atoms,
one by one, away from this wall?

529
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,760
Well, at first,
you'd say it's still a wall.

530
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,470
I brush a few more,
well, it's still a wall.

531
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:19,200
But what if I remove every single
atom from this wall except for one?

532
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,720
And you've seen me brush every
single atom from this wall

533
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,680
except for that one atom,

534
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,840
and I point to it, and I say,
"There, that's what's left."

535
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,510
That's the wall.

536
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,120
Now, is it?

537
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,000
Is that the wall?

538
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,570
What the...

539
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,080
All right, John?

540
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,080
Welcome back.

541
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,120
Language and reality

542
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,840
inform each other
as we construct...

543
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,360
Okay, I'm looking up
The Bye Bye Man, right?

544
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,820
There's nothing online,
so I type in,

545
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,120
"Don't say it, don't think it,"

546
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,040
and it led me here,
the dead archives and Redmon.

547
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,480
Here's what was in his folder.

548
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,880
I think you write it and repeat
it to try and keep from saying...

549
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,000
The Bye Bye Man.

550
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,000
Okay, but why is
that in the dead files?

551
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,200
"October 18,
1969, byline, Larry Redmon.

552
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,640
"Deerfield, Iowa.

553
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:22,120
"A teenager,
accused of murdering

554
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,320
"his own family and
four other youths.

555
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,080
"When asked by this reporter why he
would do such a thing, he replied,

556
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,720
"'The Bye Bye Man
made me do it."'

557
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,840
It's an article about
a kid who went crazy.

558
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,120
But it was never published.

559
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,120
And Larry Redmon, the writer...

560
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,280
He was pretty infamous locally.

561
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,040
After he killed this piece
about the kid in Deerfield,

562
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,760
Larry Redmon took a shotgun

563
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:46,080
and murdered eight friends
and family members

564
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,560
right here in Madison.

565
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,040
- Don't say it. Don't think it.
- Mom!

566
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,510
Don't say it. Don't think it.
Mom!

567
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:53,990
Don't say it.

568
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,080
Mom, shut the door!

569
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,770
Giselle! Who did you tell?

570
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,080
No one!
We didn't tell anyone, Larry!

571
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,730
Mommy!

572
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:10,970
Stop!

573
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,150
We didn't tell anyone!

574
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,800
I swear we didn't say anything!

575
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,440
Get back! Please!

576
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:24,120
Maybe he got inspired by
what he was writing about.

577
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:30,920
You won't win.

578
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,080
I won't let you.

579
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:09,680
There are no other mentions
of these cases anywhere else.

580
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:13,720
It's like someone redacted the whole
story, so no one else could read it.

581
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,800
Why would anyone do that?

582
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,120
Well, obviously he
was bat-shit crazy.

583
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,880
But, if you
remove all references

584
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,800
to something in the past,

585
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,960
that past no longer exists.

586
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,560
Even the idea of it is gone.

587
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,560
Maybe somebody wanted to make this
Bye Bye Man disappear permanently.

588
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,950
And you've got the
last record of it right there.

589
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,030
I'll be back.

590
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,720
Good, I have time.

591
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,480
Don't write it either, idiot.

592
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,310
What are you doing, boy?

593
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,290
Are you out of your mind?

594
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:45,610
I, um...

595
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,470
What is wrong with you, Elliot, huh?
What the...

596
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,480
I'm sorry,
I need to go. I'm late.

597
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,790
Elliot!

598
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,520
Oh, my God.

599
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:39,480
Sasha!

600
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,070
Hey, John!

601
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,360
Sasha!

602
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:49,890
Hey.

603
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:30,650
Hello.

604
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,400
Kim, it's Elliot.

605
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,600
Elliot... God, I was just
thinking about you guys.

606
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,480
You wanna come up?
Listen. Listen.

607
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:38,570
Um, what are you doing?

608
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,190
You mean, right now?
Or since the party?

609
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:44,920
Isn't that why you're here?
Kim, can you come down?

610
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,130
I want to do another séance.

611
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,440
Right now, with all
four of us, at the house.

612
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,760
Listen, you were right.

613
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,240
I was wrong.

614
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,680
Sure.

615
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,160
I'll be down in a sec.

616
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:20,530
The Bye Bye Man doesn't exist
anywhere else that I could find.

617
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,560
You don't have to
look for him, Elliot.

618
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,600
He's found us.

619
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,600
You can't help
thinking about him.

620
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,830
And the more you think about him,
the closer he gets.

621
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,230
You see things
that aren't there.

622
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,680
You don't see
things that are there.

623
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,270
Or hear things.

624
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,160
Like a coin rolling.
Yeah.

625
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,210
Like a train.

626
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,840
Some people catch
it and it spreads.

627
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,000
Some go crazy sooner,
but they all die in the end.

628
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,320
The word spreads
and he comes to you with...

629
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,320
With that thing.

630
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,440
I told Katie.

631
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,320
I didn't want to.

632
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,000
What can you do with
cancer but cut it out?

633
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:26,520
You have to stop it before it
spreads and every cell dies.

634
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:33,200
This could spread everywhere
if we don't cut it out.

635
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,150
Did you tell anyone?

636
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,760
Ms. Watkins, the librarian.

637
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,720
We have to get to her, too.

638
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,410
What do you mean,
you have to get to her?

639
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,840
Stop!

640
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:48,990
Oh, my God!

641
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,920
Stop! Elliot, stop!

642
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,870
Let me help you!

643
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,080
Kim! Wait!

644
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,170
Kim!

645
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,640
Kim! Kim!

646
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,480
No!

647
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:12,910
We have to help them!

648
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,920
What do you see?
It's a family!

649
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,360
It's in your head!

650
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,800
No, Kim! There's a train,
a real train!

651
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,400
No!

652
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,760
Kim! Move! It's in your head!

653
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,040
Kim! No!

654
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:43,120
Elliot, what happened?

655
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,600
Kim, she's dead.

656
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:47,280
Shit. Jesus.

657
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,080
Oh, my God. It was him.
He killed her.

658
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,120
You were right,
he's trying to get inside us.

659
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,970
He got in her. He's going to drive
us crazy and he's going to kill us.

660
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,000
You mean the...
Yeah.

661
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,600
He's why I was late to get you.

662
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,000
He's why you're feeling sick.

663
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,260
Have you said
the name to anyone?

664
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,000
The name... No. No.

665
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,160
Have you?

666
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:08,640
No, I haven't said...

667
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:10,930
Good. Don't. We can't say the
name to anyone else, ever.

668
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:12,820
You going to tell
me what to do now?

669
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,700
Swear you won't say the name
so we don't spread it.

670
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,280
- No...
- John, please.

671
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,480
Please.

672
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,400
Bro, swear it. You just
need to cut this shit.

673
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,710
You swear!

674
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,160
Swear!
No.

675
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,920
Swear!
Elliot, stop it!

676
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,600
Swear!
What's wrong with you, Elliot?

677
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,820
What's wrong with you?
Elliot, stop it!

678
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:29,760
Hey, guys!
Hey, break it up!

679
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:31,320
I said break it up right now!

680
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,570
Back up.

681
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,500
He got to you, didn't he?
No one got to me, all right?

682
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:38,910
Admit it.
He's making you feel angry.

683
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,360
- He's making you sick.
- Yeah?

684
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,450
He's making you crazy.

685
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,530
You on something?

686
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:43,920
No, I'm upset.

687
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,340
We're just having
a little argument.

688
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,720
You call that
a "little argument"?

689
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,880
John, please.

690
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,190
Please don't say it.

691
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,640
Don't say what?

692
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,000
Sasha?
I won't.

693
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,720
J, you can't.

694
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,400
This name of some stupid shit
Elliot thinks is dangerous.

695
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,560
Yes. I was talking about Kim.

696
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,360
There was a hammer in her bag.

697
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,760
It was covered with blood.

698
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:13,960
Oh, my God.

699
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:18,040
Train's engineer said
that you were chasing Kim,

700
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,400
with the hammer.

701
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,230
He said she was crying for help,

702
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:25,360
and that she jumped out of
your car to get away from you.

703
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,640
Jesus Christ.
Elliot?

704
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,830
That's not what happened.

705
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:33,080
No? They found Kim's roommate,
Katie Williams.

706
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,440
She was killed by a hammer,
too, but...

707
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,160
You knew that, didn't you?

708
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,760
I... Sasha,
no! I was at the library.

709
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,520
He made me lose track of time.
You have...

710
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:44,610
Sasha?

711
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,660
Do you want to talk to me here?

712
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:47,820
You want to tell
me what's going on?

713
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,260
Don't say it. Don't
think it. You were right!

714
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,290
Quiet.

715
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:53,740
Sasha, what doesn't
he want you to say?

716
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,800
Yeah, Sash.
You! Shut it!

717
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:08,770
It just happened, John.

718
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,560
You see that? It's him.

719
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:11,890
No.

720
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,250
Sasha.

721
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:17,800
What? What is it?

722
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,090
Blood.

723
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:27,810
Blood?

724
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,610
Where?

725
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,720
What do you see?
He makes you see things.

726
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,680
Fuck.

727
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:45,400
Oh, my God.
Hey! Hey! Hey!

728
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,400
Back away.
I need you over here.

729
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,840
She's fine. Stay back.

730
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,240
Wait, there he is!

731
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,090
Hey!

732
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:06,480
Hey, bud. Somethin' wrong?

733
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,840
I'm sorry. I thought...
What?

734
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,430
Hey, are you all right?

735
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,120
Wait! Wait! Sasha!

736
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,560
He's gonna take her home

737
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,980
and she's going to
lie down for a bit.

738
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,560
I'm her boyfriend.
She needs me.

739
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:24,920
Maybe. Maybe later.

740
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,700
But right now,
you're going to come with me.

741
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,200
We're going to
talk a little bit.

742
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,800
Did you say the name to anyone?

743
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,480
She didn't, man.

744
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,560
Neither of us did.

745
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,720
It's gonna be all right.

746
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,180
Don't say it. Don't think it.

747
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,220
Don't say it. Don't think it.

748
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,840
Don't think it.
Don't think it.

749
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,400
Good news for you. Maybe.

750
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,990
Kim Hines wrote a suicide note,

751
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,480
taking responsibility
for her roommate

752
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:34,560
and for the deaths of you and the
other two living at your house.

753
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,440
So, I guess she was
planning on killing you, too.

754
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,440
Is that what happened, Elliot?

755
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,960
You found out
and you chased her?

756
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,200
I don't think that's murder.

757
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:50,960
Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

758
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,560
You want to write it?

759
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:56,200
No.

760
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:58,860
You're going to
tell me, you know that.

761
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,160
I hope not.

762
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,190
Why did you chase Kim?

763
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,040
I told you,
I was trying to help her.

764
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,480
So you chased her into a train?

765
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,390
What are you doing?

766
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:11,710
You could lose everything.

767
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,040
Your scholarship,
that pretty girl.

768
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,680
You are a smart kid.

769
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,480
Talk to me and I can help you.

770
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,880
Otherwise,
it'll be out of my hands

771
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,480
and you'll be
wishing that you had.

772
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:26,470
You might find
yourself wishing I hadn't.

773
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,360
Well, you let me
worry about that.

774
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,000
You really want to know?

775
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,920
You really think the truth,
honesty, is the best policy?

776
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,920
I do.
Always?

777
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:40,040
When wouldn't it be?

778
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,600
You have kids?

779
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:45,880
Maybe.

780
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,430
You have kids.

781
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,560
Don't think it. Don't say it.

782
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:58,320
What if you saw
the worst crime scene ever?

783
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:02,400
A mass murder at a school.

784
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,910
With dead bodies and
brains and students

785
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,430
and sneakers with blood on them.

786
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:14,880
And you go home,
and your kids say,

787
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,530
"Tell us about
your day, Mommy."

788
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:21,360
You could be honest.

789
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,520
You could tell the truth.

790
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:27,960
You could describe every
awful nightmare thing you saw,

791
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,040
and what was
burned into your head

792
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,200
would be burned into
their heads forever.

793
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:36,550
Or...

794
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,400
You could hug them tight,

795
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,410
and spare them
your honest truth.

796
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,240
What would you do?

797
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:55,720
I'd hug them.

798
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,160
Please don't make me say it.

799
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,080
I haven't hurt anyone.

800
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,240
But I'm afraid of
putting this into your head.

801
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:15,760
All I have to do is talk to you,
and you and your kids...

802
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,400
You're all dead.

803
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,240
Hey! Elliot!

804
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:25,360
Your friend died?

805
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,760
What the hell is going on, man?

806
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,260
Thanks for coming to
get me, but I gotta go.

807
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,350
Was it Sasha and John...

808
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:30,920
Hey, talk to me.
Let me help you.

809
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,680
Whatever is going on,
there's nothing you can do, okay?

810
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:36,840
I literally can't tell you.

811
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,730
I'm not going to let it
happen to you, Virgil.

812
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:40,000
Especially not you.

813
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,840
What are you talking about?

814
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:46,000
You've got a family.
Go take care of them.

815
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,550
Elliot, hey!
You are my family. Elliot!

816
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,040
Shit!

817
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:21,830
Fuck!

818
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:30,830
Yeah!

819
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,080
Oh, my God.

820
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:46,830
What are you doing, Elliot?

821
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:52,680
What's... What's wrong
with you, Elliot?

822
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,200
What the...

823
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,720
I'm so sorry.

824
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:23,880
Elliot?

825
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,640
Hi, Ms. Watkins.
Hi. Elliot?

826
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,560
I've been having
some really strange thoughts

827
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:34,000
about that Bye Bye Man
since we talked.

828
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:35,720
Ms. Watkins...

829
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:39,000
Ms. Watkins, you can't
talk to anyone about it.

830
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:41,360
Well, maybe I can
come over to your house later.

831
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,200
I'm so sorry.

832
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:45,080
I'm sorry, too.

833
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:49,880
Believe me, but I've just been
having the most vivid thoughts. I...

834
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,170
Elliot?

835
01:08:58,530 --> 01:08:59,530
Elliot?

836
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,930
Redmon...

837
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,840
Larry Redmon.

838
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:09,360
The writer.

839
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,120
It was his nightstand.

840
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,760
Ms. Watkins.

841
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,290
Okay, maybe I'll see you later,

842
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,500
maybe I'll have a fix for this.

843
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,960
I gotta go. Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome...

844
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,080
I'll be there soon.

845
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,520
He almost got us, man.

846
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:39,120
Oh, fuck! I almost killed you with a bat,
but, fuck, he's not going to get us.

847
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,210
He's not going to get us.

848
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:41,950
I'll figure this out.

849
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,400
I'm really sorry, but...

850
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:46,200
I'm sorry, I can't call an ambulance,
'cause you're gonna say it.

851
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,040
You will. You will.
'Cause I messed you up.

852
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,040
I'll be back as soon as I can.

853
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,160
I'm taking this.

854
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:29,480
You found her and now
I'm going to go talk to her.

855
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,360
I love you.

856
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,200
And don't touch him.

857
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:42,960
Bye-bye, happiness

858
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:46,040
Hello, loneliness

859
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,550
I think I'm gonna cry

860
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:51,190
Bye-bye, love

861
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,830
Bye-bye, sweet caress

862
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,440
Hello, emptiness

863
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:59,030
I feel like I'm gonna die

864
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,280
Bye-bye, my love, goodbye

865
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,070
Hello?

866
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:30,480
Mrs. Redmon?

867
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,870
Leave.

868
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,040
Ms. Redmon?

869
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:48,400
I said, leave! Are you deaf,
or just defective?

870
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:51,920
Ms. Redmon, did your husband write
for The Register a long time ago?

871
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:54,790
You're too young
to remember that.

872
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,320
Ms. Redmon.
You're still alive.

873
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,880
I know your husband
killed a lot of people.

874
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,210
But I don't think he was crazy.

875
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:11,240
I need your help,
whatever you remember.

876
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:13,920
There's a train, gold coins...

877
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:15,690
A hound...

878
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:17,480
He came to Larry.

879
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,800
With the hound.

880
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,510
What Larry told me
gave me nightmares.

881
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,000
I made him stop.

882
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,890
I understand.

883
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:30,800
But I need you to tell me
everything Larry said.

884
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,640
Please.

885
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,160
Larry was on a story of a
teenager who killed his family.

886
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:42,880
Poked around like a good nosy
reporter and heard rumors...

887
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:45,520
Whispers about an evil,

888
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:49,200
some kind of a reaper
that drove the teenager mad.

889
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:52,850
Larry had to go nosing around
and writing it down.

890
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,930
And then it came to Larry, too,

891
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,760
this nightmare, this name
we must not think or say.

892
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:06,200
But just three days after
Larry got back from Iowa,

893
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,120
I came home from work.

894
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:11,280
October 20th, 1969.

895
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:14,880
The day my life
went turn-turn-turn...

896
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,480
Don't say it. Don't think it.

897
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:21,320
Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

898
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,960
Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

899
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,160
Don't say it. Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

900
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,960
Don't say it. Don't think it.

901
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,920
Oh, my God.

902
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,360
Don't say it.

903
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:43,000
Larry... Oh, my God.

904
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,630
I was just doing my job.

905
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:53,120
That's what I do.
I track down the story.

906
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:55,000
And that's what I was doing.

907
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:57,830
See...

908
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,880
Once you know his name,
you can't escape him.

909
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:07,520
You see,
he gets in your head and...

910
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,590
He makes you do horrible things.

911
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,240
Okay. Okay.

912
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:15,400
What horrible things?

913
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:17,680
Who makes you do this?
What are you talking about?

914
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,140
Let's get you to bed,
okay, sweetheart?

915
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:23,840
Listen. Listen, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.

916
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,560
And then the hound...

917
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:27,040
That's how you know he's coming.

918
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,400
When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,

919
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:31,240
that's when you
know he's close by.

920
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,280
- You understand?
- No, I...

921
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:35,830
Larry...

922
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,080
I don't know what's happened,
but I'm trying...

923
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,640
He listens for his name.

924
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,880
Anyone could say it.
It could be you.

925
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,110
Or it could be me.

926
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:47,150
And it's just dumb luck
like the flip of a coin.

927
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:52,280
And I heard the name
and I told Janey the name.

928
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:54,400
"Don't think it.
Don't say it."

929
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,000
What does this mean?
What did you write?

930
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:58,560
I don't understand.

931
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,200
He makes you see things.

932
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,680
And he makes you do things.

933
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:08,240
Who knows how many good people he's
made do horrible things like this.

934
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:10,630
No! Oh, God, no! Please.

935
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:12,000
Please, don't.

936
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,800
Please put it down.

937
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,680
You think it's me?

938
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,560
You think I did this?

939
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:23,000
This is what happens.

940
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:26,040
They say people snap.
They say people go crazy.

941
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:27,440
No, it's him.

942
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,120
It's him that's doing it!

943
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,520
Just put it...
Put it down. Okay?

944
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:33,670
No.

945
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:35,890
I love you.

946
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,600
But in the end,
Larry was a hero.

947
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:40,240
You tell people that.

948
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,240
Larry erased him, you see.

949
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:45,950
He did away with everyone who'd heard
it before they could pass it on.

950
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,440
But not you.

951
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:48,880
You're here.

952
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,760
How did you
survive all this time?

953
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,120
Survive?
Yes.

954
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:54,750
How did you beat it?

955
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,040
I didn't beat it.

956
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,480
I never knew it.

957
01:15:58,570 --> 01:15:59,710
What?

958
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,200
If my husband had
told me the name,

959
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,740
he'd have had to
kill me with the rest.

960
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,400
My husband controlled himself.

961
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:08,440
Your fucking husband wrote the name in
the nightstand you sold and I read it.

962
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:11,240
He typed it in a dead article
and I read that, too!

963
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,330
Don't you say it!

964
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:14,360
Your husband spared
you and he got me.

965
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,200
He's in me now.
He's in my friends.

966
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,840
You want my help?
Yes.

967
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,130
Here.

968
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:26,600
Kill all of the ones you told
first and then kill yourself.

969
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,960
It's the only way.

970
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:39,120
No!
There has to be another way.

971
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,840
"Don't say it.
Don't think it." It's a clue.

972
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:44,080
Look.

973
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,320
Oh, my God. He's coming!

974
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,840
What are you talking about?
You didn't bring him here.

975
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,520
Don't you see it?
See what?

976
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:54,200
The light... Hear the name...
He's in your head.

977
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,990
He makes us see things,
hear things, tricks to make us afraid.

978
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:01,320
He makes us afraid.
Then he grows.

979
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,640
The more scared we are,
the more real he gets.

980
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,320
We make him real with our fear.

981
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,440
We make him more powerful.

982
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,160
Yeah, we give him the power

983
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,450
and he gets closer and he hears
us when we think of him.

984
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,920
But maybe, if we're not afraid,
we take his power.

985
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,280
Maybe, if we're not afraid,
he's nothing!

986
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:27,230
How could you figure it out
and my Larry not?

987
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:30,630
Help me!

988
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,120
Shoot me!

989
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:39,830
Shoot me now!

990
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,320
No, no! It's not real!

991
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,390
No, it's not real.

992
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,000
Help me!

993
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:01,120
I have you now, don't I?

994
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,680
Come on, try another trick.
Come on, try it!

995
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:08,950
Where are you?

996
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,280
Where are you?

997
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:15,310
Oh, my God.

998
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:17,350
Sasha!

999
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,110
Pick up.

1000
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,560
Sasha?

1001
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:28,980
Hey. It's Sasha.
Leave a message...

1002
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,250
You better not fuckin' hurt her!

1003
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:31,330
Thanks.

1004
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:34,000
Sasha. I'm coming.

1005
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:37,120
I know it's hard,
but don't be afraid.

1006
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,800
And don't believe
anything you see.

1007
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,120
Whoa, what the...

1008
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:54,930
What?

1009
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:00,120
No, you're not real.

1010
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:03,930
Not real!

1011
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:07,510
Ha! I knew it!

1012
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,000
Okay. Tricks.

1013
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:54,800
You want to play tricks?

1014
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,550
Okay. I'm ready.

1015
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:48,160
Elliot!

1016
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,870
John!

1017
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,360
Where are you guys?

1018
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,480
Elliot?

1019
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:10,310
Sasha!

1020
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:18,910
Elliot!

1021
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,170
Sasha?

1022
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:27,120
I'm in here.

1023
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:32,920
Oh, God.

1024
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:41,920
You look like hell.

1025
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:43,190
Jesus.

1026
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,840
There you are.

1027
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:54,040
Elliot...
Thank God. You're back.

1028
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:56,720
I'm not...

1029
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:01,870
Oh, my God.

1030
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,320
Hey, what's the matter?

1031
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:09,720
Elliot, what are you doing?

1032
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,010
Shit.

1033
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:14,570
Get away.

1034
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:16,480
Hey, come on,
it's all going to be okay.

1035
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:18,640
We're going to be okay.
I feel better.

1036
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:19,870
Get away!

1037
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,280
Elliot! It's me!

1038
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:30,400
What the hell?

1039
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:33,000
Elliot, I don't understand.
What are you doing?

1040
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,150
Help!

1041
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,680
Elliot! Come on.

1042
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,360
Come here, John.

1043
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:38,960
Please, Elliot!
Help!

1044
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:46,640
I don't understand.
Please.

1045
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,090
No.

1046
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,240
Come on.
No!

1047
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:53,400
Please.

1048
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:58,400
Stop. Elliot, please stop!
Will you just stop?

1049
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:03,560
Get away from me!

1050
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,130
Get away!

1051
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,950
Guys!

1052
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:27,760
Sasha, John, it's a trick.
It's not real.

1053
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,160
Listen to me!

1054
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:35,470
Sasha, John.
Listen to me, it's not real.

1055
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:41,690
John, no!

1056
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,840
Elliot! Shoot! Shoot!

1057
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,250
No!

1058
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:52,240
Go ahead. Kill me.

1059
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,350
You win.

1060
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:10,960
No.

1061
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:12,790
You leave them alone!

1062
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:26,720
Come on, guys.
It's freezing out here.

1063
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:27,950
Hey, man. Anybody home?

1064
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:31,440
I've got Alice here.
She's here to cheer you up, buddy.

1065
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:33,200
Elliot!
No!

1066
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,040
Hey! Anybody home?

1067
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,650
Guys, come on!
We know you're in there.

1068
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:48,000
I hear something. Hello!

1069
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:50,300
Open the door, you guys.
We're turning into popsicles out here.

1070
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,080
Go away!
Elliot?

1071
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:54,270
Go away!

1072
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,320
No, no. We're not
going anywhere, Elliot.

1073
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:58,240
Uncle, open up!

1074
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:00,500
Please, get her out of here.
Both of you, you need to go!

1075
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:02,660
Elliot, open the goddamn door
or I'm calling the police.

1076
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:04,080
Good. Do it!

1077
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,960
Honey, why don't you
go wait in the truck?

1078
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:08,080
No! Daddy, I got to pee!

1079
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:09,640
Go to the truck, please.

1080
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,000
Open the door, man, come on.

1081
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:12,440
Go. Go.

1082
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:14,000
Elliot!
Bye... Bye...

1083
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:21,930
No!

1084
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,040
Elliot,
what the hell is going on?

1085
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:25,530
Virgil,
please, get her out of here.

1086
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:27,760
Uncle Elliot!

1087
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,160
Okay, Peanut, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

1088
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,640
I need you to go to the truck.

1089
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:38,240
No, Daddy, I got to go!

1090
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:40,610
Go someplace close where I can
see ya, and be quick, okay?

1091
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:41,650
Outside?

1092
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,100
No one is going to see you,
baby. It's okay.

1093
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,560
Go. Go. Go.

1094
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:50,960
Elliot. Elliot,
what is going on in there?

1095
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,690
Don't think it. Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

1096
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:56,280
Elliot, what are
you saying? What?

1097
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:57,880
I have to do this.
I'm not crazy.

1098
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,040
Let me help you.

1099
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:02,040
No, you can't. But I
can help you, if you go!

1100
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:03,680
But I'm not going
to let you catch it!

1101
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,560
Bye...
Don't say it! Don't think it!

1102
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,480
What? Don't say what?
Just go!

1103
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:15,380
Jesus Christ, what was that?
Elliot, what was that?

1104
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:29,440
The Bye Bye Man. Bye Bye...

1105
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,600
Bye Bye?
What is that? Bye Bye?

1106
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:36,960
What is it, what are you saying?

1107
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:03,480
Bye Bye what?

1108
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:08,560
What is that?
Elliot? Bye Bye what?

1109
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,320
I love you so much.

1110
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:15,920
Elliot!

1111
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,200
Alice.

1112
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:38,800
Alice? Alice!

1113
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:40,830
Alice?

1114
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:42,390
Alice?

1115
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:44,320
Where are you, baby?

1116
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:46,640
Alice!

1117
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:54,760
Alice? Alice?

1118
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,200
Honey?

1119
01:29:58,850 --> 01:29:59,990
Alice?

1120
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:07,510
Alice?

1121
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:12,360
Alice!

1122
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:22,240
Honey! Come here!

1123
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:23,440
I was cold!

1124
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:26,320
Oh, I know, honey,
but you scared me so much!

1125
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:32,240
Oh, no! Look!

1126
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,120
Uncle Elliot!

1127
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,280
It's okay.

1128
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:37,910
It's okay.

1129
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:42,200
The fire can't hurt him anymore.

1130
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,720
So, this
boy ran a librarian over,

1131
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:55,000
mutilated and
murdered her children,

1132
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:57,470
and then killed his
roommates and himself

1133
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:00,840
and you had him in custody
today, but you let him go?

1134
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:05,760
Yes. But this is not some creepy
kid pulling a Columbine, okay?

1135
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,200
I talked to him.

1136
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:09,800
Something is going on here.
I can feel it.

1137
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:37,240
I wanted to say goodbye.

1138
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,760
I know, baby. Me, too.

1139
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:48,920
At least he gave me the coins.

1140
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:52,920
What are you talking about?

1141
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:56,160
He must've left them
out there for me to find.

1142
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,480
Left them out where, honey?

1143
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:03,480
In the little table.

1144
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:07,080
Outside, next to the trash cans.

1145
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:12,960
Well, was there
anything else in this table?

1146
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:14,720
No.

1147
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:17,480
Just some writing.

1148
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:18,840
Writing?

1149
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:21,400
What did this writing say?

1150
01:32:23,730 --> 01:32:26,920
Daddy. You know I
can't read in the dark.

1151
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:31,000
What do you think I am?
A flashlight?

1152
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,040
We got one alive!

1153
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:57,770
Get me a tool,
a line and morphine!

1154
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:59,520
Wait, wait!
He's trying to say something!

1155
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:01,910
Hey, I'm listening, go ahead.

1156
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,170
It won't matter.

1157
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,320
It does matter.

1158
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,680
Okay, take your time.

1159
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:09,310
It's okay. I'm here.

1160
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:11,160
And I want to know.

1161
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,550
Please. Please tell me.

1162
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,520
Bye Bye Man...
