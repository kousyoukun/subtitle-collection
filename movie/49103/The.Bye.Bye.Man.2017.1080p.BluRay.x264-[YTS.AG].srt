1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,961
Jane!

2
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,961
Jane!

3
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,563
Jane, it's me! Open up.

4
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,401
Did you tell anyone?

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,601
Did I...

6
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,643
About the name. The name?

7
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,246
Yeah, I told Rick.
He thought it was funny.

8
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,211
Just Rick and nobody else?

9
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,566
No.

10
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,042
Why, what's the matter?

11
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,929
Larry, what's wrong?

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,731
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,608
You have no idea how sorry I am.

14
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,842
Larry, you're scaring me.

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,564
What are you doing?

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,365
Rick!

17
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,686
Ricky!

18
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,004
Rick, the name!

19
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,491
Janey!

20
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,161
Did you tell anyone? Anyone!

21
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,041
Larry, please, please! I...

22
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,168
Rick, he's coming!

23
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,526
The name!

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,929
Giselle. I told Giselle!

25
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,929
I'm going to stop you!

26
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,046
Giselle!

27
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,370
- Larry...
- Mom!

28
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,930
Who did you tell?

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,490
He killed them!

30
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,645
Don't think it.

31
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,131
- Mom, come on!
- Don't say it.

32
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,402
Don't think it. Don't say it.

33
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,241
Don't think it. Don't say it.

34
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,007
Don't think it. Don't say it.

35
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,490
Giselle! Did you say the name?

36
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,847
Don't think it. Don't say it.

37
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,560
Don't say it.

38
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,001
Don't say it.

39
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,607
Who did you say the name to, Giselle?

40
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,001
What the hell are you...

41
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,206
Larry!

42
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,485
What's up, playboy?

43
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,891
- How's it going?
- Good.

44
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,850
Today is a good day.

45
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
- You got the key?
- No, it's under the mat.

46
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,361
Oh! Come on.

47
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,805
It's only 20 minutes.

48
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,963
This is the first time he's rented the place.
The guy says it's fantastic.

49
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,889
What else would he say,
"It's a dog house"?

50
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,725
No, I'm trying to convince her, let's go.
Come on, man, work with me.

51
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,848
- Sash?
- Yeah. I'm up for it.

52
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,681
It's a little creepy. Right?

53
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,285
Nah, it's just cold.

54
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,200
Heat's off.

55
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,409
I've got to piss like a race horse.

56
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,727
Cute.

57
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,531
Dude, this place is sweet, bro.

58
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,201
Hey.

59
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,041
Right?

60
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,681
We could put the desk over there.

61
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,169
We could put the bed here.

62
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,128
Well, maybe if there was a bed.

63
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,444
I know, the landlord said
it was fully furnished.

64
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,321
Yo, El, come and check
this out, man. This is crazy.

65
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,448
Come on down.

66
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,731
Yo, El, come in here, man.

67
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,883
See, you can't get this
in the dorms, right?

68
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,042
Now, that's classic.

69
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,489
John, you really think Sasha
wants to see that, or that?

70
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,289
You got the whole upstairs
to make girly, okay?

71
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,520
- I've definitely seen bigger.
- See? You're awesome.

72
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,523
Bro, she's awesome, man.

73
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,480
Oh, yeah, you guys must've been
hilarious when you were young.

74
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,244
"Must've been"? Are.

75
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,004
Tier 1.

76
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,924
Hey, he made me look smart,
and I made him look ugly.

77
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,968
But after the crash, he took care of me.

78
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,285
Talk shit about my
boy's folks, you're done.

79
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,287
Okay, when the Tier 1s are both ready

80
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,647
to cook and clean and help me
do this place up right.

81
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,566
'Cause I'm not going
to be your guys' maid.

82
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,291
Of course not. I told him. Right?

83
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,089
Well, I never cooked you
my butter pasta-nette.

84
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,164
That is not a thing.

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,444
- That's 'cause I invented it.
- Okay.

86
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,806
And I clean, too.

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,245
I promise.

88
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,520
Yo, what does this do?

89
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,647
Yeah, you cook.

90
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,166
Yes, I cook, okay? I don't bake.

91
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,401
Found the furniture.

92
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,562
I've heard about you and all the girls.

93
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,121
And that's exactly why we need
to get out of the dorms.

94
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,240
This is perfect.

95
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,163
Whoa. Easy.

96
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,691
You all right?

97
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,769
Yeah, thanks.

98
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,367
So, it looks like
the landlord wasn't lying.

99
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,851
Wow.

100
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,091
Damn, son.

101
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,365
Hey, I like this.

102
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,041
Ow. Fuck.

103
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,447
So?

104
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,761
Don't you want to?

105
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,646
Well, yeah, yeah. I do. Now I know you...

106
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,087
Yo, all the dishes in here, they're white.

107
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,401
Just saying.

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,050
He touches everything.

109
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,361
It's up to you, Bear.

110
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,968
I can't afford it without him.
I know you can, but I don't...

111
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,326
Elliot. Elliot.

112
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,804
- Yeah?
- We're doing it. Obviously.

113
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,405
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

114
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,204
I see she approves, huh?

115
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,885
- Hey, you need a hand?
- No, I got this.

116
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,766
- Okay, don't break yourself.
- Better than going to the gym, right?

117
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,162
- Hey, Elliot?
- Yeah?

118
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,847
- Hey, did you hear that banging?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,647
The radiators sound worse.

120
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,444
Okay, Bear, here it is.

121
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,202
Rilke says, "Coins symbolize
the wonder and terror of fortune.

122
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,046
"Do you land face up

126
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,451
I'm wiped.

127
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,961
Hmm.

128
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,643
Thanks for finding me that quote.

129
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,927
You wanna watch something stupid?

130
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,481
Mmm-hmm.

131
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,926
Just us, yeah.

132
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,884
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

133
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,690
Hey, what's on the bed?

134
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,890
"You look like a model from the '70s.

135

"The personal pilot of

Hey, Elliot, that's not funny!

146
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,640
Elliot?

147
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,041
Hey.

148
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,965
What's wrong?

149
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,407
Hey!

150
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,080
What's up, man?

151
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,446
- Oh, Little brother!
- How's it going?

152
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,726
Look at this place. Fantastic.

153
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,966
- Hi, darling.
- Hey.

154
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,005
Hi, Uncle Elliot!

155
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,003
- Hey, Niece Alice!
- Hey, hey.

156
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,161
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

157
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
Sorry we're so early,
your brother's pathological.

158
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,768
It's called being prompt and professional.

159
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,444
- Virgil's awesome.
- Thank you.

160
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,843
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

161
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,848
Here's your housewarming present.

162
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,731
You going to help me drink it?

163
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,847
No!

164
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,051
Look at this.

165
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,081
So, a house off-campus with
John Henry and a live-in girlfriend.

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,241
You ready for this?

167
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,049
She's the one, Virgil.

168
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,724
She did all this herself.

169
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,804
That's great, it's just,
you know... Be smart.

170
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,450
Be a student, man.

171
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,444
It's the last time to have
no responsibilities. Enjoy it.

172
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,363
I don't want that. I want what you have.

173
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
An amazing wife, an amazing daughter.

174
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,291
Well, just don't rush it.

175
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,930
That's all out there waiting for you.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,924
Believe me, what I have is great. It is.

177
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,841
But I missed out on all this.

178
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,969
I mean, what a college edu-ma-cation
could have done for me.

179
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,646
You have a scholarship, man.

180
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,484
You should be upstairs studying right now.

181
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,690
Jesus. It's a good
thing you're not jealous.

182
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,761
It is good.

183
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,446
Come on, man, you got this. You got this!

184
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,487
Come on, come on, come on. Come on.

185
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,766
All right, all right.

186
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,561
Baby!

187
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,364
Bam! Thank you! Thank you!

188
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,682
An oldy-old gold coin, huh?

189
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,806
Yeah, I put it back on the little table
next to the bed.

190
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,041
I didn't want to keep it.

191
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,804
It's 'cause you're the best, most honest,

192
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,486
smartest, cutest, heaviest,
oldest person here.

193
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm not the heaviest, or the oldest.

194
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,685
Dad's the oldest and he's the heaviest.

195
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,921
What?

196
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,886
She ratted me out.

197
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,646
Here.

198
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,006
Head-bump.

199
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,846
Fist-bump.

200
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,847
That's John's room, we're upstairs.

201
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,365
All right, we're out of here.

202
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,568
Buddy, great party.

203
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,766
Be good.

204
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,686
Bye, guys. Bye, Alice.

205
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,242
Kim? She's in my Lit class.

206
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,090
Girls who wear hats inside
are crazy, you know that, right?

207
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,527
She's going to do a psychic
cleansing after everyone leaves.

208
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,682
- Cool, can I leave, too?
- No.

209
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,445
She's just gonna burn some sage,
and you are going to be nice.

210
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,883
Maybe you need a hat.

211
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,081
It's a twist-off.

212
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,525
Oh, thank you.

213
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,602
John, do you think this house is creepy?

214
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,011
- Mmm.
- Yup.

215
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,048
I don't, but I'm not a girl.

216
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,124
And I think you should get dressed,
'cause we're playing baseball.

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,527
Why do jocks always have
to play games, even at a party?

218
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,761
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

219
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,962
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

220
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,164
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

221
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,363
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

222
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,847
"Don't say it. Don't think it."

223
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,848
Miss Sasha steps up to the plate.

224
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,886
She's going long! She's going long!

225
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,008
Okay, all right, all right. You got this?

226
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,127
All right.

227
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,527
Oh! Yes!

228
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,684
- Oh, you all right?
- Yeah.

229
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,841
You're drunk.

230
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,484
So, you thought
there were sounds and what?

231
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,528
- "Bad vibrations"?
- Yeah.

232
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,962
And now if they're gone,
then what's the big deal?

233
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,122
We burned all that bad shit away, right?

234
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,326
That's tight.

235
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,004
You're actually psychic?

236
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,525
Sensitive, my mother says.

237
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,601
Oh, "Sensitive," huh?

238
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,451
So, what, your mom locked you under
the stairs when you were a kid?

239
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,681
You shoot knives at her.

240
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,489
Yeah. No.

241
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,806
But I could find stuff.

242
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,689
I always knew when people were
coming over to the house.

243
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,045
You know what I'm thinking?

244
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,766
Yes. I might just do that.

245
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,963
Damn, you are psychic.

246
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,285
Sensitive there, for sure.

247
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,323
- Elliot...
- It's okay, Sasha.

248
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,562
People have doubted me my whole life.

249
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,971
Elliot, you can go ahead

250
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,089
and live a sheltered, shallow,
physical existence.

251
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,806
Well, a non-physical existence
would be kind of tough.

252
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,201
What Aristotle is trying to say is...

253
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,526
Well, he needs proof.

254
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,211
Yeah, is that crazy?

255
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,529
Okay, let's just take some deep breaths.

256
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,601
Okay.

257
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,404
So, if nothing happens,
I should believe, 'cause it means

258
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,720
you got rid of the spirit.

259
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,205
- Elliot, come on.
- What?

260
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,203
We all know you don't believe
in this stuff, okay?

261
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,282
But can you just please let her do it?

262
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,488
Right. Sorry. No being rational.

263
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,721
I give over. I do.

264
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,201
Yo, El, just loosen up
the grip a little bit,

265
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,408
I'm trying to concentrate on my breathing.

266
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,809
Are you ready, ladies?

267
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,644
Okay, let's do this thing. Come on.

268
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,645
Now, I have no ego about it,
but I do know this stuff.

269
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,287
Okay, cool. Well, what do you know?

270
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,530
Okay.

271
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,169
I know your parents died in a crash.

272
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,920
Dude...

273
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,604
He didn't tell me.

274
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,681
They did.

275
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,329
Bro, I didn't say anything. Swear.

276
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,686
I would never tell anyone that.

277
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,845
They're worried about you, though.

278
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,242
All right, I'm sorry I laughed at you
before, but that's not funny.

279
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,006
I'm not being funny, Elliot.
This is just what I'm getting.

280
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,325
Okay, how did they die?

281
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,966
What kind of accident was it?

282
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,370
Your brother will do anything
in his power to protect you now.

283
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,010
But they worry that
he's taking on too much.

284
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,686
All right. So, you talked
to my brother tonight.

285
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,401
Sasha, your...

286
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,202
Your grandmother has some
biscuits or rolls or something.

287
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,761
Gam's Rolls?

288
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,771
Come on, everybody's grandma
bakes biscuits.

289
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,128
Yeah. He's not wrong about that.

290
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,521
This is... This is... You know what?

291
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,886
You want to blindfold me, too?

292
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,041
Just hang on.

293
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,811
I'll take you up on that, though.

294
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,041
I'm all down for the blindfolding,

295
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,844
- whatever you got...
- Of course.

296
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,044
Okay, what'd I hide? Where'd I hide it?

297
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,610
- Oh, come on. That's crazy.
- Elliot...

298
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,966
Shh.

299
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,929
You know what? I...

300
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,524
I don't like this.

301
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,485
Yeah, I don't want to do this anymore.

302
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,564
Maybe this was a bad idea.

303
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
Nah, come on.

304
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,491
You're a good faker, I admit it.

305
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,648
You put the keys in a pot on the stove.

306
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,441
Did you?

307
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,961
You heard.

308
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,091
You were listening for it, weren't you?

309
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,684
Well, I didn't hear that, did you?

310
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,807
No.

311
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,248
- Something's coming.
- What?

312
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,164
They're saying,

313
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,166
"Don't...

314
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,450
"Don't think it.

315
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,521
"Don't say it.

316
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,288
"Don't say it. Don't think it.

317
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,769
"Don't say it. Don't think it.

318
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,844
"Don't say it! Don't think it!

319
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,841
"Don't say it! Don't think it!
Don't say it! Don't think it!

320
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,160
"Don't say it! Don't think it!"

321
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,529
Don't say or think what?

322
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,326
The Bye Bye Man.

323
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,728
Jesus! What the fuck?

324
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,162
Kim! Oh, my God.

325
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,241
Hey...

326
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,160
- What happened, Kim?
- Kim?

327
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,605
Are you all right?

328
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,490
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

329
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,847
Nothing. Nothing. Sorry.

330
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,405
Are you sick?

331
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,409
Good night. Love you.

332
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,924
I love you, John.

333
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,361
What?

334
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,807
Hey. You're joking, right?

335
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,207
Sasha, you're kidding, right?

336
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,046
What?

337
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,729
What the hell is that?

338
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,121
Come on!

339
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,884
John, let's go!

340
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,724
Look, I'm trying...

341
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,846
Like this?

342
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,681
Hey.

343
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,241
Shh.

344
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,885
- What are you doing?
- Do you hear that?

345
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,369
What the hell is that?

346
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,971
You ready?

347
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,681
Thanks for being nice to me last night.

348
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,841
That was pretty crazy.

349
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,605
It was. Definitely.

350
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,643
You want to go inside?

351
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,688
My roommate's car isn't here.

352
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,765
We could try again.

353
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,122
These things happen, right?

354
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,685
Actually, not to me, they don't.

355
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,521
Yeah.

356
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,047
Actually, not to me, either.

357
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,286
A guy not finishing up,
I've never had that happen before.

358
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,361
Come on.

359
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,850
I'm hungry.

360
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,486
Jesus.

361
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,641
What?

362
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,361
Nothing.

363
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,446
Nothing, okay?

364
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,251
Kim, I need to go.

365
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,006
Now.

366
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,169
Fuck.

367
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,050
Dude, check this out.

368
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,765
They were already there, right?

369
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,961
No.

370
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,530
It was Colin or one of
those douches from last night.

371
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,250
No, listen, I heard it.

372
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,371
I heard something after
the party outside, scratching.

373
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,882
What do you mean, you heard something?

374
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,800
Morning.

375
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,002
See, you are clean and beautiful.

376
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,166
That's nice.

377
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,481
What was that?

378
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,602
- John, you drive Kim home?
- Yeah.

379
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,205
And now I gotta wash her off.

380
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,283
The girl's gross, man. Total pig.

381
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,409
Come on, man, that's not cool.
Don't say that.

382
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,130
Oh, sure, yeah, it's easy for you to say.

383
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,043
Your girlfriend is perfect.

384
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,448
Oh, God.

385
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,886
You okay?

386
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,970
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't be
playing baseball in the cold.

387
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,525
That's the problem
with being an alcoholic.

388
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,609
Oh, shut up, I didn't
even drink that much.

389
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,409
Maybe that was the mistake.

390
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,204
I'll make you some tea.

391
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,961
Come on.

392
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,484
Fuck him.

393
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,491
Bear, you went away there for a second.

394
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,440
I did?

395
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,244
Yeah. Where'd you go?

396
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,400
God, you're shivering.

397
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,163
I was just thinking.

398
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,321
About John?

399
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,125
No, little brother, it's cool.

400
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,806
You can call me any time, you know that.

401
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,451
Are you really taking on too much?

402
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,204
Are you worried about protecting me?

403
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,930
What is going on?

404
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,161
Is it Sasha?

405
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,131
Yeah, she's been really sick and scared.

406
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,525
And John's been acting weird.

407
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,570
You guys seemed like you were great.

408
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,005
Were we? You saw them dancing together.

409
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,688
Talk to me, buddy, what's going on?

410
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,606
Elliot?

411
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,641
What?

412
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,449
You wanna go get lunch
tomorrow or something,

413
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,851
we'll talk about this then?

414
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,289
You know what, listen, I gotta go.

415
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,684
There's something I gotta...

416
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,762
I gotta deal with something.

417
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,441
El...

418
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,966
Guys?

419
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,046
Guys, what are you doing up there?

420
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,650
Hello? Anyone down there?

421
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,321
Hello?

422
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,201
Hello?

423
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,847
Guys! Help!

424
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,567
No!

425
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,720
Guys!

426
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,289
What are you doing, Elliot?

427
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,041
- You were here the whole time?
- Yes.

428
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,201
That's bullshit.

429
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,691
But we were, Elliot.

430
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,046
You didn't answer me.

431
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,521
- We didn't hear you!
- What were you doing?

432
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,888
Studying, talking...

433
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,811
- You didn't hear me? You didn't hear me?
- We weren't doing anything.

434
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,804
Elliot, for the last time, bro,
we wouldn't do that to you!

435
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,041
Why are you lying to me?

436
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,201
- We're not!
- Jesus Christ.

437
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,361
Then what just happened, huh?

438
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,400
And there were sounds... I mean, come on!

439
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,450
I told you there was something happening.

440
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,045
Now do you believe me?

441
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,689
Hey, don't worry, okay?

442
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,046
What are you doing? Don't do that.

443
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,201
- Don't do what?
- Don't...

444
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,611
- Elliot...
- No, no, no. Don't touch her.

445
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,727
- What?
- Don't touch her!

446
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,404
You are a crazy paranoid, bro!

447
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,204
Yeah, you're a little warm.

448
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,321
Okay, so you weren't with John.

449
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,362
Am I hearing things? Am I seeing things?

450
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,521
Tonight you thought the house
was empty when we were here.

451
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,002
You went away, Elliot.

452
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,882
I kind of went away, too.

453
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,686
What?

454
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,610
I sat down to study...

455
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,161
I don't remember doing any of that.

456
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,890
It's like now that I know his name,

457
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,166
he's coming for me.

458
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,324
And the more I try to get rid of it,
the bigger it gets.

459
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,401
It's horrible.

460
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,764
Hey, babe.

461
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,329
Bye Bye Man's not real.

462
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,687
It's just something that's in our heads.

463
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,930
That's real.

464
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,889
Ideas are real.

465
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,248
If it's not,

466
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,328
then, Elliot, we're all losing
our minds at the same time.

467
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,921
And what are the chances of that?

468
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,080
- What the hell is that?
- What is it?

469
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,481
What...

470
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,925
Elliot, there's nothing here.

471
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,168
So, you're not going to be late, right?

472
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,289
No, I'll meet you at 2:00 sharp,
right where we parked.

473
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,331
I'm going to find out how real
this thing is. The name...

474
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,922
You're going to talk to the landlord
about the furniture?

475
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,411
And the house.

476
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,926
Maybe he can find somewhere else.

477
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,607
You're feeling better, though?

478
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,886
I guess.

479
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,683
It's hard to be scared
in the middle of the day.

480
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,128
I'm going to take care of you.

481
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,165
Oh, my God.

482
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,285
You're shivering.

483
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,567
I'm going to figure this out, I promise.

484
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,244
I'll see you at 2:00.

485
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,766
I love you.

486
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,247
"Register Archive. Dead File 69. Redmon."

487
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,131
Here, put these on.

488
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

489
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,011
They're originals and we don't want

490
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,408
your sweaty palms messing up
the documents in the box.

491
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,008
Now, the dead file has dead articles,

492
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,402
material that got
killed before going to press,

493
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,041
but still saved for posterity.
And it was written by Redmon.

494
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,806
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

495
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,130
Thank you, Dennis.

496
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,726
- Mr. Daizy?
- Yes, how are you doing?

497
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,605
Not so great, actually.

498
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,050
Uh, me and my friends

499
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,485
are renting your place

500
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,847
out in Sun Prairie. 37 Oakdale.

501
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,922
Oh, yeah, the two handsome guys.

502
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,081
Are you with them?

503
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,851
You have a weird house, Mr. Daizy.

504
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,291
Really, it's awful.

505
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,483
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way,
but they did sign a lease.

506
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,926
Bless you.

507
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,161
Sorry.

508
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,330
- You okay?
- It's really cold in here.

509
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,846
It's a hothouse.
It's actually not cold at all, honey.

510
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,410
Maybe you should be home in bed?

511
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,402
Look, Mr. Daizy.

512
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,563
There was an old nightstand
in the basement.

513
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,563
And it has this writing inside it.

514
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,171
Where did it come from?

515
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,846
A nightstand?

516
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,365
Let's begin by considering this wall...

517
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,370
Now, we can all agree that the sentence...

518
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,249
- Sorry.
- Yeah, have a seat.

519
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,090
Now, we can all agree that this sentence,

520
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,881
"This is a wall," is a truth claim.

521
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,921
This wall is real. I see it, you see it.

522
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,411
We can touch it.

523
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,361
Likewise, if I were to brush
a few atoms from this wall,

524
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,841
it would still be here.
It would still be here before us.

525
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,082
It would still be "the wall."

526
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,607
But what if I continued

527
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,688
to slowly brush the atoms,
one by one, away from this wall?

528
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,726
Well, at first,
you'd say it's still a wall.

529
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,441
I brush a few more,
well, it's still a wall.

530
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,163
But what if I remove every single atom
from this wall except for one?

531
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,684
And you've seen me brush
every single atom from this wall

532
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,649
except for that one atom,

533
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,805
and I point to it, and I say,
"There, that's what's left."

534
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,480
That's the wall.

535
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,088
Now, is it?

536
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,967
Is that the wall?

537
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,521
What the...

538
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,047
All right, John?

539
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,045
Welcome back.

540
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,090
Language and reality

541
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,806
inform each other as we construct...

542
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,321
Okay, I'm looking up
The Bye Bye Man, right?

543
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,086
There's nothing online, so I type in,
"Don't say it, don't think it,"

544
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,004
and it led me here,
the dead archives and Redmon.

545
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,444
Here's what was in his folder.

546
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,843
I think you write it and repeat it
to try and keep from saying...

547
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,967
The Bye Bye Man.

548
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,969
Okay, but why is that in the dead files?

549
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,170
"October 18, 1969, byline, Larry Redmon.

550
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,605
"Deerfield, Iowa.

551
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,082
"A teenager, accused of murdering

552
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,282
"his own family and four other youths.

553
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,046
"When asked by this reporter why he
would do such a thing, he replied,

554
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,690
"'The Bye Bye Man made me do it."'

555
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,809
It's an article about
a kid who went crazy.

556
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,083
But it was never published.

557
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,083
And Larry Redmon, the writer...

558
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,242
He was pretty infamous locally.

559
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,006
After he killed this piece
about the kid in Deerfield,

560
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,731
Larry Redmon took a shotgun

561
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,041
and murdered eight friends
and family members

562
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,531
right here in Madison.

563
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,002
- Don't say it. Don't think it.
- Mom!

564
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,481
- Don't say it. Don't think it.
- Mom!

565
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,960
Don't say it.

566
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,046
Mom, shut the door!

567
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,731
Giselle! Who did you tell?

568
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,046
No one! We didn't tell anyone, Larry!

569
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,681
Mommy!

570
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,921
Stop!

571
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,121
We didn't tell anyone!

572
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,770
I swear we didn't say anything!

573
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,410
Get back! Please!

574
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,084
Maybe he got inspired by
what he was writing about.

575
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,890
You won't win.

576
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,050
I won't let you.

577
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,644
There are no other mentions
of these cases anywhere else.

578
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,691
It's like someone redacted the whole story,
so no one else could read it.

579
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,770
Why would anyone do that?

580
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,083
Well, obviously he was bat-shit crazy.

581
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,844
But, if you remove all references

582
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,763
to something in the past,

583
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,922
that past no longer exists.

584
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,527
Even the idea of it is gone.

585
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,529
Maybe somebody wanted to make this
Bye Bye Man disappear permanently.

586
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,921
And you've got the
last record of it right there.

587
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,000
I'll be back.

588
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,684
Good, I have time.

589
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,450
Don't write it either, idiot.

590
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,281
What are you doing, boy?

591
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,241
Are you out of your mind?

592
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,561
I, um...

593
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,441
- What is wrong with you, Elliot, huh?
- What the...

594
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,442
I'm sorry, I need to go. I'm late.

595
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,761
Elliot!

596
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,486
Oh, my God.

597
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,446
Sasha!

598
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,041
Hey, John!

599
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,326
Sasha!

600
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,841
Hey.

601
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,601
Hello.

602
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,366
Kim, it's Elliot.

603
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,569
Elliot... God, I was just
thinking about you guys.

604
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,445
- You wanna come up?
- Listen. Listen.

605
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,521
Um, what are you doing?

606
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,161
You mean, right now? Or since the party?

607
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,884
- Isn't that why you're here?
- Kim, can you come down?

608
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,086
I want to do another séance.

609
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,404
Right now, with all
four of us, at the house.

610
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,724
Listen, you were right.

611
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,211
I was wrong.

612
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,646
Sure.

613
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,129
I'll be down in a sec.

614
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,200
The Bye Bye Man doesn't exist
anywhere else that I could find.

615
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,523
You don't have to look for him, Elliot.

616
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,570
He's found us.

617
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,567
You can't help thinking about him.

618
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,801
And the more you think about him,
the closer he gets.

619
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,201
You see things that aren't there.

620
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,642
You don't see things that are there.

621
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,241
Or hear things.

622
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,122
- Like a coin rolling.
- Yeah.

623
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,161
Like a train.

624
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,804
Some people catch it and it spreads.

625
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,969
Some go crazy sooner,
but they all die in the end.

626
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,287
The word spreads
and he comes to you with...

627
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,282
With that thing.

628
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,410
I told Katie.

629
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,290
I didn't want to.

630
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,962
What can you do with
cancer but cut it out?

631
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,482
You have to stop it before it
spreads and every cell dies.

632
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,168
This could spread everywhere
if we don't cut it out.

633
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,121
Did you tell anyone?

634
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,726
Ms. Watkins, the librarian.

635
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,684
We have to get to her, too.

636
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,285
What do you mean, you have to get to her?

637
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,806
Stop!

638
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,961
Oh, my God!

639
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,881
Stop! Elliot, stop!

640
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,840
Let me help you!

641
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,051
Kim! Wait!

642
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,121
Kim!

643
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,602
Kim! Kim!

644
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,447
No!

645
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,881
We have to help them!

646
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,883
- What do you see?
- It's a family!

647
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,325
It's in your head!

648
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,770
No, Kim! There's a train, a real train!

649
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,367
No!

650
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,723
Kim! Move! It's in your head!

651
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,004
Kim! No!

652
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,082
Elliot, what happened?

653
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,571
Kim, she's dead.

654
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,245
Shit. Jesus.

655
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,045
- Oh, my God.
- It was him. He killed her.

656
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,089
You were right,
he's trying to get inside us.

657
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,891
He got in her. He's going to
drive us crazy and he's going to kill us.

658
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,962
- You mean the...
- Yeah.

659
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,566
He's why I was late to get you.

660
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,966
He's why you're feeling sick.

661
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,166
Have you said the name to anyone?

662
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,969
The name... No. No.

663
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,127
Have you?

664
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,606
No, I haven't said...

665
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,489
Good. Don't. We can't say
the name to anyone else, ever.

666
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,686
You going to tell me what to do now?

667
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,609
Swear you won't say the name
so we don't spread it.

668
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,250
- No...
- John, please.

669
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,446
Please.

670
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,369
- Bro, swear it.
- You just need to cut this shit.

671
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,680
You swear!

672
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,126
- Swear!
- No.

673
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,884
- Swear!
- Elliot, stop it!

674
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,564
- Swear!
- What's wrong with you, Elliot?

675
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,721
- What's wrong with you?
- Elliot, stop it!

676
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,723
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, break it up!

677
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,290
I said break it up right now!

678
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,521
Back up.

679
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,403
- He got to you, didn't he?
- No one got to me, all right?

680
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,881
Admit it. He's making you feel angry.

681
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,325
- He's making you sick.
- Yeah?

682
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,401
He's making you crazy.

683
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,481
You on something?

684
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,886
No, I'm upset.

685
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,246
We're just having a little argument.

686
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,685
You call that a "little argument"?

687
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,844
John, please.

688
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,160
Please don't say it.

689
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,606
Don't say what?

690
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,967
- Sasha?
- I won't.

691
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,683
J, you can't.

692
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,367
This name of some stupid shit
Elliot thinks is dangerous.

693
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,526
Yes. I was talking about Kim.

694
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,331
There was a hammer in her bag.

695
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,731
It was covered with blood.

696
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,926
Oh, my God.

697
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,006
Train's engineer said
that you were chasing Kim,

698
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,366
with the hammer.

699
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,201
He said she was crying for help,

700
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,329
and that she jumped out of your car
to get away from you.

701
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,606
Jesus Christ. Elliot?

702
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,801
That's not what happened.

703
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,043
No? They found Kim's roommate,
Katie Williams.

704
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,403
She was killed by a hammer, too, but...

705
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,130
You knew that, didn't you?

706
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,726
I... Sasha, no! I was at the library.

707
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,485
He made me lose track of time. You have...

708
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,561
Sasha?

709
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,561
Do you want to talk to me here?

710
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,721
You want to tell me what's going on?

711
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,165
Don't say it. Don't
think it. You were right!

712
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,241
Quiet.

713
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,651
Sasha, what doesn't he want you to say?

714
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,768
- Yeah, Sash.
- You! Shut it!

715
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,601
It just happened, John.

716
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,526
You see that? It's him.

717
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,841
No.

718
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,201
Sasha.

719
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,762
What? What is it?

720
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,041
Blood.

721
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,761
Blood?

722
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,561
Where?

723
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,682
What do you see? He makes you see things.

724
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,645
Fuck.

725
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,364
- Oh, my God.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

726
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,363
Back away. I need you over here.

727
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,805
She's fine. Stay back.

728
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,210
Wait, there he is!

729
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,041
Hey!

730
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,446
Hey, bud. Somethin' wrong?

731
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,807
- I'm sorry. I thought...
- What?

732
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,400
Hey, are you all right?

733
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,084
Wait! Wait! Sasha!

734
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,886
He's gonna take her home
and she's going to lie down for a bit.

735
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,530
I'm her boyfriend. She needs me.

736
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,886
Maybe. Maybe later.

737
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,564
But right now,
you're going to come with me.

738
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,170
We're going to talk a little bit.

739
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,768
Did you say the name to anyone?

740
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,444
She didn't, man.

741
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,529
Neither of us did.

742
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,682
It's gonna be all right.

743
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,086
Don't say it. Don't think it.

744
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,127
Don't say it. Don't think it.

745
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,804
Don't think it. Don't think it.

746
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,362
Good news for you. Maybe.

747
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,961
Kim Hines wrote a suicide note,

748
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,447
taking responsibility for her roommate

749
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,525
and for the deaths of you
and the other two living at your house.

750
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,403
So, I guess she was
planning on killing you, too.

751
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,407
Is that what happened, Elliot?

752
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,926
You found out and you chased her?

753
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,166
I don't think that's murder.

754
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,925
Don't think it. Don't say it. Don't think it.

755
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,531
You want to write it?

756
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,167
No.

757
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,761
You're going to tell me, you know that.

758
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,126
I hope not.

759
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,160
Why did you chase Kim?

760
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,004
I told you, I was trying to help her.

761
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,445
So you chased her into a train?

762
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,361
What are you doing?

763
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,680
You could lose everything.

764
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,001
Your scholarship, that pretty girl.

765
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,650
You are a smart kid.

766
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,451
Talk to me and I can help you.

767
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,845
Otherwise, it'll be out of my hands

768
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,445
and you'll be wishing that you had.

769
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,440
You might find yourself wishing I hadn't.

770
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,324
Well, you let me worry about that.

771
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,965
You really want to know?

772
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,882
You really think the truth,
honesty, is the best policy?

773
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,890
- I do.
- Always?

774
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,006
When wouldn't it be?

775
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,566
You have kids?

776
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,847
Maybe.

777
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,401
You have kids.

778
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,530
Don't think it. Don't say it.

779
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,282
What if you saw
the worst crime scene ever?

780
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,368
A mass murder at a school.

781
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,881
With dead bodies and brains and students

782
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,401
and sneakers with blood on them.

783
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,846
And you go home, and your kids say,

784
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,491
"Tell us about your day, Mommy."

785
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,322
You could be honest.

786
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,482
You could tell the truth.

787
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,929
You could describe every
awful nightmare thing you saw,

788
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,002
and what was burned into your head

789
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,162
would be burned into their heads forever.

790
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,521
Or...

791
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,365
You could hug them tight,

792
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,371
and spare them your honest truth.

793
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,209
What would you do?

794
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,685
I'd hug them.

795
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,122
Please don't make me say it.

796
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,043
I haven't hurt anyone.

797
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,209
But I'm afraid of
putting this into your head.

798
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,722
All I have to do is talk to you,
and you and your kids...

799
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,370
You're all dead.

800
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,206
Hey! Elliot!

801
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,327
Your friend died?

802
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,731
What the hell is going on, man?

803
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,165
Thanks for coming to
get me, but I gotta go.

804
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,321
Was it Sasha and John...

805
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,890
Hey, talk to me. Let me help you.

806
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,651
Whatever is going on,
there's nothing you can do, okay?

807
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,808
I literally can't tell you.

808
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,689
I'm not going to let it
happen to you, Virgil.

809
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,966
Especially not you.

810
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,804
What are you talking about?

811
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,968
You've got a family. Go take care of them.

812
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,520
Elliot, hey! You are my family. Elliot!

813
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,002
Shit!

814
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,801
Fuck!

815
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,801
Yeah!

816
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,051
Oh, my God.

817
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,801
What are you doing, Elliot?

818
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,645
What's... What's wrong with you, Elliot?

819
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,165
What the...

820
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,690
I'm so sorry.

821
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,846
Elliot?

822
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,603
- Hi, Ms. Watkins.
- Hi. Elliot?

823
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,524
I've been having
some really strange thoughts

824
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,967
about that Bye Bye Man since we talked.

825
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,687
Ms. Watkins...

826
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,963
Ms. Watkins, you can't
talk to anyone about it.

827
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,327
Well, maybe I can
come over to your house later.

828
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,164
I'm so sorry.

829
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,050
I'm sorry, too.

830
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,842
Believe me, but I've just been
having the most vivid thoughts. I...

831
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,121
Elliot?

832
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,481
Elliot?

833
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,881
Redmon...

834
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,805
Larry Redmon.

835
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,326
The writer.

836
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,084
It was his nightstand.

837
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,726
Ms. Watkins.

838
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,406
Okay, maybe I'll see you later,
maybe I'll have a fix for this.

839
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,926
- I gotta go. Thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome...

840
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,044
I'll be there soon.

841
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,490
He almost got us, man.

842
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,087
Oh, fuck! I almost killed you with a bat,
but, fuck, he's not going to get us.

843
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,161
He's not going to get us.

844
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,921
I'll figure this out.

845
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,365
I'm really sorry, but...

846
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,171
I'm sorry, I can't call an ambulance,
'cause you're gonna say it.

847
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,004
You will. You will.
'Cause I messed you up.

848
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,007
I'll be back as soon as I can.

849
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,130
I'm taking this.

850
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,450
You found her and now
I'm going to go talk to her.

851
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,326
I love you.

852
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,164
And don't touch him.

853
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,928
Bye-bye, happiness

854
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,008
Hello, loneliness

855
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,521
I think I'm gonna cry

856
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,160
Bye-bye, love

857
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,800
Bye-bye, sweet caress

858
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,402
Hello, emptiness

859
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,000
I feel like I'm gonna die

860
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,242
Bye-bye, my love, goodbye

861
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,041
Hello?

862
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,451
Mrs. Redmon?

863
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,841
Leave.

864
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,005
Ms. Redmon?

865
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,365
I said, leave! Are you deaf,
or just defective?

866
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,887
Ms. Redmon, did your husband write
for The Register a long time ago?

867
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,760
You're too young to remember that.

868
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,286
Ms. Redmon. You're still alive.

869
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,845
I know your husband
killed a lot of people.

870
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,121
But I don't think he was crazy.

871
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,204
I need your help, whatever you remember.

872
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,886
There's a train, gold coins...

873
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,641
A hound...

874
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,446
He came to Larry.

875
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,767
With the hound.

876
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,481
What Larry told me gave me nightmares.

877
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,971
I made him stop.

878
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,841
I understand.

879
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,762
But I need you to tell me
everything Larry said.

880
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,606
Please.

881
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,124
Larry was on a story of a teenager
who killed his family.

882
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,846
Poked around like a good nosy
reporter and heard rumors...

883
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,486
Whispers about an evil,

884
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,167
some kind of a reaper
that drove the teenager mad.

885
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,811
Larry had to go nosing around
and writing it down.

886
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,891
And then it came to Larry, too,

887
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,727
this nightmare, this name
we must not think or say.

888
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,165
But just three days
after Larry got back from Iowa,

889
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,083
I came home from work.

890
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,243
October 20th, 1969.

891
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,847
The day my life went turn-turn-turn...

892
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,449
Don't say it. Don't think it.

893
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,285
Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

894
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,924
Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

895
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,129
Don't say it. Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

896
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,929
Don't say it. Don't think it.

897
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,885
Oh, my God.

898
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,326
Don't say it.

899
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,969
Larry... Oh, my God.

900
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,600
I was just doing my job.

901
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,082
That's what I do. I track down the story.

902
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,969
And that's what I was doing.

903
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,801
See...

904
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,846
Once you know his name,
you can't escape him.

905
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,491
You see, he gets in your head and...

906
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,561
He makes you do horrible things.

907
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,210
Okay. Okay.

908
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,362
What horrible things?

909
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,647
Who makes you do this?
What are you talking about?

910
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,051
Let's get you to bed, okay, sweetheart?

911
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,808
Listen. Listen, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.

912
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,525
And then the hound...

913
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,011
That's how you know he's coming.

914
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,367
When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,

915
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,204
that's when you know he's close by.

916
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,248
- You understand?
- No, I...

917
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,801
Larry...

918
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,042
I don't know what's happened,
but I'm trying...

919
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,605
He listens for his name.

920
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,842
Anyone could say it. It could be you.

921
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,081
Or it could be me.

922
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,121
And it's just dumb luck
like the flip of a coin.

923
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,242
And I heard the name
and I told Janey the name.

924
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,366
"Don't think it. Don't say it."

925
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,966
What does this mean? What did you write?

926
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,530
I don't understand.

927
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,162
He makes you see things.

928
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,643
And he makes you do things.

929
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:08,202
Who knows how many good people
he's made do horrible things like this.

930
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,601
No! Oh, God, no! Please.

931
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,966
Please, don't.

932
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,769
Please put it down.

933
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,642
You think it's me?

934
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,529
You think I did this?

935
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,965
This is what happens.

936
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,004
They say people snap.
They say people go crazy.

937
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,411
No, it's him.

938
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,086
It's him that's doing it!

939
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,485
Just put it... Put it down. Okay?

940
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,641
No.

941
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,841
I love you.

942
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,571
But in the end, Larry was a hero.

943
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,210
You tell people that.

944
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,203
Larry erased him, you see.

945
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,921
He did away with everyone who'd
heard it before they could pass it on.

946
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,411
But not you.

947
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,846
You're here.

948
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,728
How did you survive all this time?

949
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,086
- Survive?
- Yes.

950
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,721
How did you beat it?

951
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,005
I didn't beat it.

952
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,445
I never knew it.

953
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,681
What?

954
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,651
If my husband had told me the name,
he'd have had to kill me with the rest.

955
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,370
My husband controlled himself.

956
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,411
Your fucking husband wrote the name
in the nightstand you sold and I read it.

957
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,211
He typed it in a dead article
and I read that, too!

958
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,247
Don't you say it!

959
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,322
Your husband spared you and he got me.

960
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,164
He's in me now. He's in my friends.

961
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,809
- You want my help?
- Yes.

962
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,081
Here.

963
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,563
Kill all of the ones you told first
and then kill yourself.

964
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,926
It's the only way.

965
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,086
No! There has to be another way.

966
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,811
"Don't say it.
Don't think it." It's a clue.

967
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,045
Look.

968
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,289
Oh, my God. He's coming!

969
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,806
What are you talking about?
You didn't bring him here.

970
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,484
- Don't you see it?
- See what?

971
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,167
The light... Hear the name...
He's in your head.

972
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,961
He makes us see things, hear things,
tricks to make us afraid.

973
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,281
He makes us afraid. Then he grows.

974
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,601
The more scared we are,
the more real he gets.

975
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,290
We make him real with our fear.

976
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,408
We make him more powerful.

977
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,124
Yeah, we give him the power

978
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,328
and he gets closer and he hears us
when we think of him.

979
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,886
But maybe, if we're not afraid,
we take his power.

980
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,247
Maybe, if we're not afraid, he's nothing!

981
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,201
How could you figure it out
and my Larry not?

982
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,601
Help me!

983
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,087
Shoot me!

984
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,800
Shoot me now!

985
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,287
No, no! It's not real!

986
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,361
No, it's not real.

987
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,965
Help me!

988
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,082
I have you now, don't I?

989
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,644
Come on, try another trick.
Come on, try it!

990
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,920
Where are you?

991
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,247
Where are you?

992
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,281
Oh, my God.

993
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,321
Sasha!

994
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,080
Pick up.

995
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,525
Sasha?

996
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,880
Hey. It's Sasha. Leave a message...

997
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,200
You better not fuckin' hurt her!

998
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,281
Thanks.

999
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,966
Sasha. I'm coming.

1000
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,086
I know it's hard, but don't be afraid.

1001
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,764
And don't believe anything you see.

1002
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,090
Whoa, what the...

1003
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,881
What?

1004
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,085
No, you're not real.

1005
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,881
Not real!

1006
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,481
Ha! I knew it!

1007
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,964
Okay. Tricks.

1008
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,769
You want to play tricks?

1009
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,521
Okay. I'm ready.

1010
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,126
Elliot!

1011
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,841
John!

1012
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,325
Where are you guys?

1013
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,446
Elliot?

1014
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,281
Sasha!

1015
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,881
Elliot!

1016
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,121
Sasha?

1017
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,091
I'm in here.

1018
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,891
Oh, God.

1019
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,886
You look like hell.

1020
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,161
Jesus.

1021
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,810
There you are.

1022
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,007
Elliot... Thank God. You're back.

1023
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,685
I'm not...

1024
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,841
Oh, my God.

1025
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,288
Hey, what's the matter?

1026
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,691
Elliot, what are you doing?

1027
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,961
Shit.

1028
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,521
Get away.

1029
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,443
Hey, come on, it's all going to be okay.

1030
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,602
We're going to be okay. I feel better.

1031
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,841
Get away!

1032
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,244
Elliot! It's me!

1033
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,365
What the hell?

1034
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,966
Elliot, I don't understand.
What are you doing?

1035
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,121
Help!

1036
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,645
Elliot! Come on.

1037
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,325
Come here, John.

1038
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,930
- Please, Elliot!
- Help!

1039
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,608
I don't understand. Please.

1040
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,041
No.

1041
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,210
- Come on.
- No!

1042
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,367
Please.

1043
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,367
Stop. Elliot, please stop!
Will you just stop?

1044
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,529
Get away from me!

1045
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,081
Get away!

1046
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,921
Guys!

1047
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,727
Sasha, John, it's a trick. It's not real.

1048
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,131
Listen to me!

1049
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,440
Sasha, John. Listen to me, it's not real.

1050
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,641
John, no!

1051
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,804
Elliot! Shoot! Shoot!

1052
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,201
No!

1053
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,205
Go ahead. Kill me.

1054
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,320
You win.

1055
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:10,927
No.

1056
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,761
You leave them alone!

1057
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,684
Come on, guys. It's freezing out here.

1058
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,921
Hey, man. Anybody home?

1059
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,405
I've got Alice here.
She's here to cheer you up, buddy.

1060
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,166
- Elliot!
- No!

1061
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,003
Hey! Anybody home?

1062
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,525
Guys, come on! We know you're in there.

1063
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,962
I hear something. Hello!

1064
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,963
Open the door, you guys.
We're turning into popsicles out here.

1065
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,044
- Go away!
- Elliot?

1066
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,241
Go away!

1067
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,289
No, no. We're not going anywhere, Elliot.

1068
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,203
Uncle, open up!

1069
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,408
Please, get her out of here.
Both of you, you need to go!

1070
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,562
Elliot, open the goddamn door
or I'm calling the police.

1071
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,051
Good. Do it!

1072
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,929
Honey, why don't you go wait in the truck?

1073
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,049
No! Daddy, I got to pee!

1074
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,605
Go to the truck, please.

1075
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,966
Open the door, man, come on.

1076
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,406
Go. Go.

1077
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,970
- Elliot!
- Bye... Bye...

1078
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,881
No!

1079
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,011
Elliot, what the hell is going on?

1080
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,491
Virgil, please, get her out of here.

1081
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,725
Uncle Elliot!

1082
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,129
Okay, Peanut, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

1083
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,611
I need you to go to the truck.

1084
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,205
No, Daddy, I got to go!

1085
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,521
Go someplace close where I can
see ya, and be quick, okay?

1086
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,601
Outside?

1087
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,011
No one is going to see you,
baby. It's okay.

1088
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,525
Go. Go. Go.

1089
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,926
Elliot. Elliot, what is going on in there?

1090
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,480
Don't think it. Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

1091
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,243
Elliot, what are you saying? What?

1092
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,845
I have to do this. I'm not crazy.

1093
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,007
Let me help you.

1094
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,004
No, you can't. But I
can help you, if you go!

1095
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,650
But I'm not going to let you catch it!

1096
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,530
Bye... Don't say it! Don't think it!

1097
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,450
- What? Don't say what?
- Just go!

1098
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,044
Jesus Christ, what was that?
Elliot, what was that?

1099
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,405
The Bye Bye Man. Bye Bye...

1100
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,564
Bye Bye? What is that? Bye Bye?

1101
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,926
What is it, what are you saying?

1102
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,446
Bye Bye what?

1103
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,527
What is that? Elliot? Bye Bye what?

1104
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,284
I love you so much.

1105
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:15,886
Elliot!

1106
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,166
Alice.

1107
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,768
Alice? Alice!

1108
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,801
Alice?

1109
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,361
Alice?

1110
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,289
Where are you, baby?

1111
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,606
Alice!

1112
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,723
Alice? Alice?

1113
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,166
Honey?

1114
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,961
Alice?

1115
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,481
Alice?

1116
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,324
Alice!

1117
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,209
Honey! Come here!

1118
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,406
I was cold!

1119
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,285
Oh, I know, honey,
but you scared me so much!

1120
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,203
Oh, no! Look!

1121
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,090
Uncle Elliot!

1122
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,247
It's okay.

1123
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,880
It's okay.

1124
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,167
The fire can't hurt him anymore.

1125
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,686
So, this boy ran a librarian over,

1126
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,962
mutilated and murdered her children,

1127
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,441
and then killed his roommates and himself

1128
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,808
and you had him in custody today,
but you let him go?

1129
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:05,722
Yes. But this is not some creepy kid
pulling a Columbine, okay?

1130
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,165
I talked to him.

1131
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,766
Something is going on here. I can feel it.

1132
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,201
I wanted to say goodbye.

1133
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,731
I know, baby. Me, too.

1134
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,882
At least he gave me the coins.

1135
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,890
What are you talking about?

1136
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,124
He must've left them
out there for me to find.

1137
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,442
Left them out where, honey?

1138
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,443
In the little table.

1139
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,050
Outside, next to the trash cans.

1140
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,930
Well, was there
anything else in this table?

1141
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,687
No.

1142
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,449
Just some writing.

1143
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,806
Writing?

1144
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,362
What did this writing say?

1145
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,889
Daddy. You know I can't read in the dark.

1146
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,965
What do you think I am? A flashlight?

1147
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,006
We got one alive!

1148
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,684
Get me a tool, a line and morphine!

1149
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,484
Wait, wait! He's trying to say something!

1150
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,881
Hey, I'm listening, go ahead.

1151
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,086
It won't matter.

1152
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,286
It does matter.

1153
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,643
Okay, take your time.

1154
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,281
It's okay. I'm here.

1155
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,124
And I want to know.

1156
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,521
Please. Please tell me.

1157
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,483
Bye Bye Man...
