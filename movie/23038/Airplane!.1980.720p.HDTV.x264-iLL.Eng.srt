18
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,260
Listen, Betty, don't start up

21

Would you put all your metal objects
into this dish, please?

22
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,980
There'sjust no stopping
in a white zone,

23
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,020
Really, Vernon, why pretend?

We both know
what you're talking about,

25
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,990
You want me to have an abortion,

26
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,430
lt's the only sensible thing to do,
lf it's done properly,

therapeutically,
there's no danger involved,

32
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,170
- Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?
- Forklift?

33
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,250
lt's over there
by the baggage loader.

34
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,950
Look out!

35
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,600
- Elaine.
- Ted!

36
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,400
l came home early
and found your note.

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,510
l guess you meant for me
to read it later. l've got to talk to you.

38
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,010
l don't want to go over it any more.

39
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,840
Things haven't been right
for a long time,

40
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,050
but it'll be different,
like in the beginning.

41
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,150
Just be patient
and l'll work things out.

42
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,520
l have been patient
and l've tried to help,

43
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,560
but you wouldn't even let me do that.

44
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,790
Don't you feel anything for me
any more?

45
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,200
lt takes so many things
to make love last.

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
Most of all, it takes respect.

47
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,040
l can't live with a man
l don't respect!

48
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,140
What a pisser.

49
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,930
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone,

50
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,500
Captain Clarence Oveur,
white courtesy phone,

51
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,870
No, the white phone!

52
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
This is Captain Oveur.

53
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,010
One moment for your call
from the Mayo Clinic,

54
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,750
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone,

55
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,420
- l've got it!
- Thank you,

56
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,160
Go ahead with your call,

57
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,360
This is Dr Brody at the Mayo Clinic,

58
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,120
There's a passenger
on your Chicago flight,

59
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,390
a little girl named Lisa Davis,
en route to Minneapolis.

60
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,660
She's scheduled
for a heart transplant.

61
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,100
Tell her mother we found a donor.

62
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,200
The heart is ready for surgery,

63
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,810
We must have the recipient on
the operating table within six hours,

64
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,140
Make sure she's kept
in a reclined position,

65
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,410
and that a continuous watch
is kept on her lV.

66
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,620
lt's very important she remain calm,,,

67
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,910
Excuse me, this is the operator,

68
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,050
l have an emergency call on line five
from a Mr Hamm,

69
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,350
Give me Hamm on five, hold the Mayo.

70
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,150
You'll be back tomorrow night.
We'll have dinner. We'll talk things over.

71
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,150
l won't be back.
l've requested the Atlanta run.

72
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,860
Elaine... l promise l can change.

73
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,330
Then why didn't you take the job
that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

74
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,130
l haven't been able to get
near a plane since the war.

75
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,600
And they wouldn't hire me
because of my war record.

76
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,170
War record? You're the only one
keeping that alive.

77
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,710
For everyone else,
it's ancient history.

78
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,180
- You expect me to believe that?
- lt's the truth.

79
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,180
What's hurt you the most
is your record since the war -

80
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,950
different cities, different jobs -

81
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,520
and not one of them shows you
can accept any real responsibility.

82
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,630
- Elaine, just give me one more...
- lt's too late, Ted.

83
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,890
When l get back to Chicago,

84
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,830
l'm going to start my life
all over again. l'm sorry.

85
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,970
Excuse me, take this flower
from the Church of Religious...

86
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,850
Hi! Well, good evening.

87
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,650
There you go.
Just follow them to the back.

88
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,430
Any word on that storm lifting
over Salt Lake, Clarence?

89
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,500
No, not likely, Victor.

90
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,360
l just reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

91
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,570
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas,

92
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,930
backed up all the way to Utah.

93
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,200
lf she decides to push over the Great
Lakes, it could get plenty soupy.

94
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,210
What about that southern route
around Tulsa?

95
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,780
l double-checked
the terminal forecast,

96
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,920
and the wind's aloft
and lFR ceilings all the way.

97
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,710
Where do they top out?

98
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,720
Light scattered cover at 20,000,
icing around 18.

99
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,460
- Looks like over Denver is best.
- Denver it is.

100
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,890
Sorry, Clarence.

101
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,260
Latest report shows everything's
socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

102
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,130
Hi, Roger. Glad to have you aboard.

103
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,200
Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Victor Basta.

104
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,410
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

105
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,240
l was telling Victor
l reviewed the area report

106
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,140
for 1600 hours through 2400.

107
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,520
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas.

108
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,220
There you go. Thank you.

109
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,730
ls Elaine Dickinson on this flight?

110
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,600
The whole flight crew has boarded.
Let me see.

111
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,540
Oh, yes. She is on board.

112
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,440
l'd like one ticket to Chicago.
No baggage.

113
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Smoking, please.

114
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,360
There. Have a nice trip.

115
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,810
Striker, this is Red Leader Four,

116
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,280
Primary target covered by fog,

117
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,780
Decision to proceed is yours,

118
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,550
The decision is yours,,,

119
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,660
is yours,,, is yours,,,

120
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,900
Nervous?

121
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,730
Yes.

122
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,440
First time?

123
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,200
No. l've been nervous lots of times.

124
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,520
Hi. We'll be taking off real soon,
so l better fasten you in tight.

125
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,520
Thank you.
Oh, Mother, this is so exciting!

126
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,560
l know, but remember,
you must get some rest.

127
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,530
That's good advice. You relax,
and l'll be back after we take off.

128
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,990
Thank you.

129
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,530
- l'm going to miss you so much.
- l'm going to miss you, too.

130
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,970
Promise you'll write?

131
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,140
Every day.

132
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,880
Bill!

133
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,650
Better get on board, son.

134
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,050
All aboard!

135
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,380
209er to ground control.
We're ready to taxi.

136

00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,070
OK. Here, hurry.

142
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,550
lt's your watch. You shouldn't.
You're going to need this.

143
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,040
lt's all right. lt doesn't work.

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,420
Oh, l haven't flown for a long time.

158
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,660
Good evening.
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

159
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,930
We'll be cruising
at 36,000 feet this evening,,,

160
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,270
Relax and enjoy your flight,

161
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,140
Would you like something to read?

162
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,820
Do you have anything light?

163
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,410
How about this leaflet,
''Famous Jewish Sports Legends''?

164
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,850
Yes. Thank you.

165
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,050
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- l've got to talk to you.

166
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,730
You shouldn't have come.
l don't have time now.

167
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,900
- Stewardess?
- Excuse me.

168
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,810
No wonder you're upset. She's lovely.

169
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,590
And a darling figure.

170
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,230
Supple, pouting breasts, firm thighs.

171
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,890
lt's a shame you two
don't get along.

172
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,330
Yes, l know.

173
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,130
Things used to be different.

174
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,170
l remember when we first met.

175
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,040
lt was during the war.

176
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,080
l was in the air force, stationed in
Drambuie, off the Barbary Coast.

177
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,720
l used to hang out
at the Magumba Bar,

178
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,150
lt was a rough place,
The seediest dive on the wharf,

179
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,990
populated with every reject and
cut-throat from Bombay to Calcutta,

180
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,560
lt was worse than Detroit,

181
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,570
The mood in the place was ugly,

182
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,610
You wouldn't be there unless
you knew how to use your fists,

183
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,610
Afight broke out almost every night,

184
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,350
l didn't go there that night to fall in love,
l just wanted a couple of drinks,

185
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,460
And suddenly, there she was,

186
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,230
l was captivated, entranced,
lt hit me like a thunderboit,

187
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,540
l had to ask this guy to pinch me
to make sure l wasn't dreaming,

188
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,280
l was afraid to approach her,

189
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,180
but that night, fate was on my side,

190
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,850
We laughed, we talked, we danced,

191
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,680
l never wanted it to end.
l guess l still don't.

192
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,750
Enough about me. l hope
this hasn't been boring for you.

193
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,860
But whenever l talk about Elaine, l get
so carried away. l lose all track of time.

194
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,160
Would you like to order dinner?

195
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,730
- Joey will have steak. We'll have fish.
- When can l see the cockpit?

196
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,770
The pilots are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

197
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,240
Aw, gee whizz!

198
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,310
l'll talk to the captain
and see what l can arrange.

199
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,770
Gee, that'd be swell!

200
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,540
Would you care to order your dinners?

201
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,700
Excuse me, l happened to be passing.

202
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,240
l thought you might like some coffee.

203
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,070
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

204
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,170
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

205
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,290
- Cream?
- No, l take it black.

206
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,720
Like my men.

207
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,090
Ted, l never knew
l could be so happy.

208
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,630
These past few months
have been wonderful.

209
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,630
Tomorrow, why don't we drive
to that little seafood place and...

210
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,010
- What's the matter?
- My orders came through.

211
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,940
My squadron ships out tomorrow.

212
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,580
We're bombing the storage depots
at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

213
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,580
We're coming in from the north,
below their radar.

214
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,290
- When will you be back?.
- l can't tell you that. lt's classified.

215
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,130
Oh, Ted, please be careful.
l worry about you so much.

216
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,720
l love you, Elaine.

217
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,000
l love you.

218
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,450
Flight 209er,
this is Denver flight control,

219
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,250
You're approaching rough weather,
Please climb to 42,000 feet,

220
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,270
- Roger, Denver.
- We have a visitor.

221
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,690
Hello.

222
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,940
Captain Oveur, Mr Murdock,
and Mr Basta, this is Joey Hammen.

223
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,140
- Hi, Joey.
- Come up here.

224
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,140
This is for special visitors.
Would you like to have it?

225
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,780
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- Sure. Ever been in a cockpit?

226
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,320
No, l've never been up
in a plane before.

227
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,680
Have you ever seen
a grown man naked?

228
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,760
- Shall l check the weather?
- No, why don't you take care of it?

229
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,930
Joey, do you ever hang around
the gymnasium?

230
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,720
- We'd better get back.
- No, Joey can stay for a while.

231
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,130
- Could l?
- OK, if you don't get in the way.

232
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,470
Flight 209er to Denver,
climbing to cruise at 42,000.

233
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,940
We'll report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

234
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,050
Wait a minute, l know you.
You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

235
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,150
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

236
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,650
Sorry, you have me confused
with someone else.

237
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,550
My name's Roger Murdock.
l'm the co-pilot.

238
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,420
You are Kareem! l've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

239
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,460
You should go back to your seat now.
Right, Clarence?

240
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,670
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

241
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,870
All right, but just remember
my name is Roger Murdock.

242
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,600
l'm an airline pilot.

243
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,400
l think you're the greatest,

244
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,240
but my dad says you don't work
hard enough on defence.

245
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,110
And he says lots of times
you don't even run downcourt.

246
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,450
And you don't try,
except during the play-offs.

247
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,420
The hell l don't!

248
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,990
Listen, kid, l've been hearing that crap
ever since l was at UCLA.

249
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,600
l'm out there busting my buns
every night.

250
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,740
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

251
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,770
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

252
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,720
Joey... Do you like movies
about gladiators?

253
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,360
Elaine, just hear me out.

254
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,290
Things haven't been right
for a long time, but it'll be different,

255
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,330
like in the beginning, remember?

256
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,070
l remember everything.

257
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,170
All l have is memories.

258
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,640
Mostly, l remember the nights
we were together.

259
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,180
l remember how you used to hold me,

260
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,540
how l used to sit on your face
and wriggle, and...

261
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,310
afterwards, how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

262
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,890
When it did, it was almost like...

263
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,250
like each new day was created
only for us.

264
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,190
That's the way
l've always wanted it to be.

265
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,060
But it won't be.

266
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,530
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past!

267
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,110
You're too low, Ted!

268
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,990
The mind plays tricks on you.

269
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,600
He looks so happy today, doesn't he?

270
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,530
You look so happy today.

271
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,110
OK, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

272
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,970
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

273
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,580
Headquarters? What is it?

274
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,810
A big building where generals meet,
but that's not important.

275
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,550
They've cleared you of any blame
for what happened on that raid.

276
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,810
- lsn't that good news?
- ls it?

277
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,120
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

278
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,920
Seven. Lieutenant Zip
died this morning.

279
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,860
But Dr Sandler says you'll be out
in a week. lsn't that wonderful?

280
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,970
l wish l could say the same
for George Zip.

281
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:10,010
Be patient, Ted. Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

282
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,410
Hey, Striker, how about a break?.
l'm getting tired.

283
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,280
Yeah, all right. Take five.

284
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,490
Thanks.

285
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,180
l found a wonderful apartment for us.
lt has a brick fireplace

286
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,230
and a cute bedroom
with mirrors on the ceiling and...

287
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,560
Red Leader, l'm going down!

288
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,170
Captain Geline. He thinks he's a pilot,
still fighting the war.

289
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,570
l've found the tunnel, Johnson!
lt's this way!

290
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,510
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

291
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,610
- What's his problem?
- lt's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

292
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,550
Severe shell shock.
He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

293
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,740
War is hell.

294
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,790
Excuse me, sir. Would you like
some coffee before dinner?

295
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,050
No. No, thank you.

296
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,630
- Would you like another cup?
- l will, but Jim won't.

297
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,730
l think l will have
another cup of coffee.

298
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,360
Jim never has a second
cup of coffee at home,

299
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,930
- Excuse me, Sister.
- Yes?

300
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,780
- There's a little girl on board who's ill.
- Oh, yes, l saw. Poor child.

301
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,020
Could l borrow your guitar?
l thought l'd cheer her up.

302
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,620
- Of course.
- Thank you.

303
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

304
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,260
Do you mind if l talk
to your daughter?

305
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,870
l think that'd be nice.

306
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,540
- Hi, l'm Randy.
- l'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!

307
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,740
l thought maybe you'd
like to hear a song.

308
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,450
l'd love to.

309
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,620
OK. Let's see...

310
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,380
This is one of my favorites.

311
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,670
You're late. We've been waiting.

312
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,970
- Who's first?
- Go ahead, Clarence.

313
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,870
How's the weather?

314
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,410
We got some heavy stuff ahead of us.
We've got to climb on top.

315
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,380
Yeah, after the war, l wanted
to get as far away as possible,

316
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,650
so Elaine and l
joined the Peace Corps.

317
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,160
We were assigned
to an isolated tribe, the Molombos.

318
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,260
They'd never seen Americans before.

319
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,580
lt was really a challenge, introducing
them to our Western cuiture,

320
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,590
At first, they didn't know
what to think of us,

321
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,160
But soon, we gained their trust,

322
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,310
lt'll help you better
prepare storing foods

323
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,810
for the up and coming
monsoon months.

324
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,780
Also, Supperware products
are ideal for storing leftovers

325
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,920
to help stretch your food dollar.

326
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,620
This two-quart
''Seals-M-Rite'' container

327
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,690
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

328
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,160
These people had been completely
isolated from civilization,

329
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,770
No one had outlined a physical
fitness program for them,

330
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,940
and they had no athletic equipment,

331
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,870
l started them on simple calisthenics,
worked up to rudimentary game skills,

332
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,910
and finally,
advanced competitive theory,

333
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,250
l was patient,
and they were eager to learn,

334
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,750
They seemed to enjoy themselves,

335
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,490
Probably due to advanced
American teaching techniques,

336
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,250
we bridged the generations
of isolation,

337
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,790
and communicated successfully
with the Molombos,

338
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,830
They're getting the hang of it. When we
re-enlist, l'll teach them baseball.

339
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,900
Ted, l don't want to stay here.

340
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,270
lt's time to go home to the plans
we made before the war.

341
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,450
A lot of people made plans
before the war. Like George Zip.

342
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,490
At that moment, l realised Elaine
had doubts about our relationship,

343
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,200
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem,

344
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,890
We did come back to the States.
l tried a number of jobs.

345
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,370
l could go on,
but l'd probably bore you.

346
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,240
l really couldn't blame Elaine.
She wanted a career.

347
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,940
- l can't stand it.
- What is it?

348
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,150
- Yes?
- lt's my stomach.

349
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,560
l haven't felt this awful since we saw
that Ronald Reagan film.

350
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,490
l'll see if l can find some Dramamine.

351
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,700
Captain, a woman passenger
is very sick.

352
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,110
- Airsick?.
- l think so, l've never seen it so acute,

353
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,580
Find out if there's a doctor on board,
as quietly as you can.

354
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,150
Joey, have you ever been
in a Turkish prison?

355
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,560
l shouldn't have had
that second cup of coffee.

356
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,340
Jim never vomits at home,

357
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,710
Sorry to wake you. l'm looking for a
doctor. There's nothing to worry about.

358
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,750
Stewardess, l think
the man next to me is a doctor.

359
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,820
Sir, excuse me. Sorry to wake you,
are you a doctor?

360
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,860
- That's right.
- We have sick passengers.

361
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,320
- Could you take a look at them?
- Yes, of course.

362
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,410
Let me see your tongue.

363
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,600
l'll be back in a minute.

364
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:08,770
Tell the captain to land.
She must go to a hospital.

365
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,780
A hospital! What is it?

366
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,680
lt's a big building with patients,
but that's not important.

367
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,690
- l must speak to the captain.
- Certainly.

368
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,920
Victor, we're running into heavy...

369
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,430
Roger, take over!

370
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,390
- Captain, how soon can you land?
- l can't tell.

371
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,530
- You can tell me. l'm a doctor.
- No, l'm not sure.

372
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:02,570
- Can't you take a guess?
- Not for another two hours.

373
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,810
You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

374
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,040
No, we can't land.
Fog has closed down everything.

375
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,440
We've got to get through to Chicago.

376
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,450
Get him out of there!

377
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,510
- What is it, Doctor? What's going on?
- l'm not sure.

378
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,280
Haven't seen anything like this
since the Anita Bryant concert.

379
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,030
- What did we have for dinner?
- We had a choice - steak or fish.

380
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,990
Yes, l remember. l had lasagna.

381
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,530
- What did he have?
- He had fish.

382
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,630
Doctor, two more are sick.
The other passengers are worried.

383
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,930
l'll handle the passengers.

384
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,900
Find out what the sick people had for
dinner. This is Captain Oveur speaking.

385
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,580
lt's bumpy, but we'll be past it
in a few minutes,

386
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,580
We're now flying over Hoover Dam,

387
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,840
and later we'll pass
south of the Grand Canyon,

388
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,820
Meanwhile, relax
and enjoy your flight, OK?

389
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,890
Chicago, this is flight 209er.
We're in trouble.

390
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,900
Have all traffic below us cleared.
l want a priority landing in Chicago.

391
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,200
Yes?

392
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,970
My husband's very sick.
Can you do something?

393
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,740
The doctor will be with you
in just a moment.

394
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,450
- Do you know what he had for dinner?
- Yes, we both had fish. Why?.

395
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,150
lt's nothing to be alarmed about.
We'll be back to you very quickly.

396
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,090
Doctor, Mr Hammen ate fish,

397
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,820
and Randy said there are five
more cases, and they all had fish.

398
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,590
The co-pilot had fish.
What did the navigator have?

399
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,240
He had fish.

400
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,100
All right, now we know
what we're up against.

401
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,820
Every passenger who had fish for
dinner will soon become violently ill.

402
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,920
- Just how serious is it?
- Extremely serious.

403
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,450
lt starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

404
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,920
When the virus penetrates,
the victim becomes dizzy,

405
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,490
and begins to experience
an itching rash.

406
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,390
From there, the poison works
on the central nervous system,

407
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,970
causing severe muscle spasms,
followed by the inevitable drooling.

408
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,900
At this point,
the digestive system collapses,

409
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,670
accompanied
by uncontrollable flatulence.

410
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,710
Until the poor bastard is reduced to
a quivering, wasted piece of jelly.

411
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,470
Put it on... automatic pilot.

412
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,400
Automatic pilot, automatic pilot...
There it is!

413
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,890
l'll go back to the passengers.

414
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,820
Come in, 209er, This is Chicago,

415
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,360
Flight 209er, come in,

416
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,960
This is Elaine Dickinson,
the stewardess.

417
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,030
Captain Oveurs passed out. We've
lost the co-pilot and navigator, too.

418
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,290
- We're in trouble.
- Roger,

419
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,940
l'm Steve McCroskey,
Chicago air control,

420
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,010
l'll be back in a minute.
Hold all takeoffs.

421
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,580
When 508 reports, bring it straight in.

422
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,370
Suspend all meal service
on flights out of Los Angeles.

423
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,480
Tell all dispatchers
to remain at their posts.

424
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,240
- How about coffee?
- No, thanks.

425
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,920
l want the weather
on every available landing field.

426
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,630
You understand?

427
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,950
Any place available
to land that plane!

428
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,690
Go to the tower
and get a runway diagram.

429
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,100
Check down the field
for emergency equipment.

430
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,470
Chief, we got fog every place
east of the Rockies.

431
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,510
They'll have
to come through to Chicago.

432
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,170
Looks like l picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

433
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,440
Get the best available man
who won't crack under pressure.

434
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,810
How about Mr Rogers?

435
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,500
Next to the throttle
is the airspeed gauge,

436
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,320
What speed does it indicate?

437
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,360
520 miles per hour.

438
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,430
Good. Very good.
Now, check your altitude.

439
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,330
That's the dial below and right
of the airspeed indicator.

440
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,810
35,000 feet.

441
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,510
No, wait. 34,000 feet.

442
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,770
No. lt's dropping!
lt's dropping fast!

443
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,920
Why is it doing that?

444
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:35,450
Oh, my God! The automatic pilot,
it's deflating!

445
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,030
Elaine, don't panic.

446
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,960
On his belt line
there's a hollow tube.

447
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,260
That's the manual inflation nozzle,
Pull it out and blow on it,

448
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,370
What the hell's going on up there?

449
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,660
- Elaine.
- Yes, Doctor.

450
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,600
You're a member of this crew.

451
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,640
- Can you face some unpleasant facts?
- No.

452
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,240
Unless we hospitalise
those people quickly,

453
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,310
l can't be sure of saving their lives.

454
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,040
ls there anyone on board
who can land this plane?

455
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,780
No one l know of.

456
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:19,760
You ought to know our chances.
Our lives depend on just one thing -

457
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,630
finding someone to fly this plane
who didn't have fish for dinner.

458
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,910
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your stewardess speaking.

459
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,210
We regret any inconvenience
the sudden cabin movement caused.

460
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,650
This is due to periodic air pockets,

461
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,660
There's no reason to become alarmed,
We hope you enjoy your flight,

462
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,600
By the way, is there anyone on board
who can fly a plane?

463
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,430
Hello. l'm Paul Carey from the airline.
l'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

464
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,030
Yes. Come in, Paul.
Rex will be right out.

465
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,940
Shep, sit. Sit!

466
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,740
l understand there's an emergency.

467
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,920
Something like that. There wasn't time
to tell me very much...

468
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,750
Shep, no!

469
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,010
l'll bet exciting things happen
all the time down there.

470
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,020
The airline business
does have its moments.

471
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,490
After a while, you get used to it.

472
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,060
Shep! Come!

473
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,160
He gets so excited
when new people are here.

474
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,240
- Are you a pilot?
- No, l'm in...

475
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,600
a training program.

476
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,540
lt's unbelievable.
lt's just unbelievable.

477
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,210
How many times have l warned
about food inspection?

478
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,110
You'd think
someone would listen to you.

479
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,590
Well, airport management,
the FAA, and the airlines...

480
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,820
they're all cheats and liars.

481
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,490
All right. Let's get out of here.

482
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,370
l'm sorry, l was just looking
for someone with flying experience.

483
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,770
When they built those roads,
they didn't think about drainage,

484
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,780
so we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

485
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,780
We were lucky to get a jeep,
since, just the day before,

486
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,510
the only one we had broke down.
lt had a bad axle...

487
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,820
Excuse me, sir.
There's a problem in the cockpit.

488
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,720
The cockpit? What is it?

489
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,520
The little room where the pilot sits.
That's not important.

490
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:15,300
The first officer is ill. The captain needs
someone to help him with the radio.

491
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,300
Do you know anything about planes?

492
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,370
l flew in the war years ago.

493
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,750
- l wouldn't know anything about it.
- Would you go up, please?

494
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:46,100
The stewardess said...

495
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,000
- Both pilots?
- Can you fly this plane and land it?

496
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,270
- Surely, you can't be serious.
- l am serious, and don't call me Shirley.

497
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,210
Doctor, l've checked everyone.
Mr Strikers the only one.

498
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,350
- What's your flying experience?
- l flew single-engine fighters.

499
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,290
This plane has four engines.
lt's an entirely different kind of flying.

500
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,690
lt's an entirely different
kind of flying.

501
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,960
l haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

502
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,600
Mr Striker,
l know nothing about flying.

503
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:27,970
But l do know that you're the only one
on this plane who can possibly fly it.

504
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,140
You're the only chance we've got.

505
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:15,060
That's right. That's what l said.
You heard me.

506
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,380
Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

507
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,220
Every piece of emergency equipment
you can reach.

508
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,800
Alert every rescue unit
from here to the Rockies.

509
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,900
Chief!

510
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,000
- We'll need a free-landing flight check.
- lt's your wife.

511
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,470
l want the kids in bed by nine, the dog
fed, the yard watered, the gate locked.

512
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,300
Get a note to the milkman -
''No more cheese.''

513
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,980
Where the hell is Kramer?

514
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,390
No, he can't do that.
The risk of a flame-out's too great.

515
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,690
Keep him at 24,000... No, feet.

516
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,660
A passenger is
going to land that plane.

517
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,000
- ls that possible?
- lt's a hundred to one shot.

518
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,570
- l know this guy.
- You do? Who is it?

519
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,950
Ted Striker. l flew with him during
the war. lt won't make my job easier.

520
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,980
Ted Striker was a crack
flight leader, up to a point.

521
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:29,100
He was one of those men who...
felt too much inside.

522
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,200
Maybe you know that kind.

523
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,830
He went all to pieces
on a particular mission.

524
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,300
Let's just hope
that doesn't happen tonight.

525
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,940
Let's see... Altitude, 24,000 feet.

526
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,650
Level flight. Speed, 520 knots.

527
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,590
Course Zero Niner Zero.

528
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,490
Trim, mixture.
Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

529
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,230
Ted! What are you doing here?
You can't fly this plane!

530
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,510
That's what l'm trying to tell them.

531
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,970
Elaine. l don't have time to be gentle,
so l'll be very direct.

532
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,770
Everyone is in a desperate situation.

533
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,550
Mr Striker is the only hope we got.

534
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,520
Those are the flaps.
This is the thrust.

535
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,520
This must turn on the landing lights.

536
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,540
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Mayday?. What the hell is that?

537
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,220
May Day's the Russian new year.
We'll have a big parade and serve...

538
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,800
l can't stand it any more.

539
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,490
l've got to get out of here!

540
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:15,970
- Calm down! Get ahold of yourself!
- Please let me handle this.

541
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,710
Calm down. Get back to your seat.
l'll take care of this.

542
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,840
Calm down. Get ahold of yourself.

543
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,340
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

544
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:31,610
- Everything will be all right.
- Sister, l can handle this.

545
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,020
Got to get out of here!

546
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,030
We'd like you to have this flower.

547
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,960
Excuse me, sir, would you...

548
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:46,530
Donations for Reverend Moon?

549
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,600
Jews for Jesus?

550
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,810
Read about Jehovah's Witnesses?

551
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,510
How about Buddhism?

552
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,780
Help Jerry's kids?

553
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,510
- Scientology?.
- For nuclear power?

554
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,130
Your attention, please,
No-frills passengers now arriving,

555
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,860
Please have your baggage
claim checks ready to show

556
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,190
upon leaving the terminal,

557
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,330
This guy has no airline experience.

558
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,900
He's a menace to everything in the air.
Yes, birds, too.

559
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,440
OK, he's a terrible risk,
but what other choice have we got?

560
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,940
That's the whole story, Rex.
Everything we know.

561
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:37,990
Let's face a few facts.
l flew with Striker during the war.

562
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:42,120
He can't afford to worry about those
times when... things weren't so good.

563
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:46,020
- Right now things aren't so good.
- Let me tell you something.

564
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,750
Striker was a top-notch
squadron leader long ago.

565
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:53,770
Get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

566
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,100
Let him get the feel
of that airplane,

567
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:01,240
then you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground.

568
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,840
- Very well. Put Striker on the speaker.
- Use my radio.

569
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,410
l picked the wrong week
to quit drinking.

570
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,050
You can work them direct
from here, Captain.

571
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,230
Striker? Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

572
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,230
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

573
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,770
All right.
lt's obvious you remember me.

574
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,580
What do you say we forget about
everything, except what we must do?

575
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,520
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

576
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,950
You know l've never flown a bucket
like this. l'll need all the luck there is.

577
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,560
Stand by, Striker.

578
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:57,600
Our one hope is to build this man up.
l've got to give him confidence.

579
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:02,240
- You ever flown a multi-engine plane?
- No, never,

580
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,970
Shit! lt's a goddamn waste of time.

581
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:09,440
- There's no way he can land it!
- You got to talk him down!

582
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,810
Route him into Lake Michigan,
At least avoid killing innocent people,

583
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,610
You're the only chance they've got.

584
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,620
All right.

585
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,860
Striker, you listen,
and you listen close.

586
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,860
Flying a plane
is like riding a bicycle.

587
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:32,620
lt'sjust harder to put baseball cards
in the spokes, Get the feel of the plane,

588
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,700
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

589
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,470
All right.
Disengage the automatic pilot.

590
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:47,240
Make no violent control movements
like you did in the fighter planes.

591
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,210
All right.
l'll unlock the automatic pilot.

592
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,460
The controls will feel very heavy
compared to a fighter,

593
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,870
Don't worry about that,
lt's perfectly normal,

594
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,280
Now, one more thing,

595
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,140
Can somebody work the radio
and leave you free for flying?

596
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,250
- The stewardess is here with me.
- Have her sit in the co-pilot seat,

597
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,560
Elaine, he wants you
to sit in the co-pilot seat.

598
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,170
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

599
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,940
All right, l'll level with you all.

600
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:51,200
The most important thing
is that you remain calm.

601
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,510
There's no reason to panic.

602
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,910
lt's true one of the crew members is ill.

603
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,950
Slightly ill.

604
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,620
The other two pilots are fine.

605
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:06,330
They're flying the plane, free to pursue
a life of religious fulfilment.

606
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:11,590
The radio is all yours. Keep an eye
on number three engine gauge.

607
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,270
lt's running a little hot.

608
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,680
Striker, first l'd like to say something,

609
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,510
l know things must look
pretty rough up there.

610
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,370
lf you do what l tell you
when l tell you,

611
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,170
there's no reason
you should lack confidence

612
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,940
in your chances of coming out
alive and in one piece,

613
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,490
What weather are you in?

614
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:38,960
- Rain.
- And a little ice.

615
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,750
And a little ice.

616
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:46,990
- How's it handling?
- Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

617
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,670
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

618
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,700
All right, Striker.
You're doing just fine.

619
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,110
lt's damn good
he doesn't know l hate his guts.

620
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,870
lt's damn good
you don't know he hates your guts.

621
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,220
Can l get you something?

622
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,800
l'm sorry. l don't understand.

623
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,330
- Stewardess. l speak jive.
- Good.

624
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,200
He said he's in great pain, and he
wants to know if you can help him?

625
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,710
Tell him to relax.
l'll be back with some medicine.

626
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:39,190
Just hang loose, blood.
She'll get some medicine.

627
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,950
My Mama didn't raise no dummies,
that's obvious.

628
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,960
Cut me some slack, Jack.

629
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:51,590
Chump don't want no help,
chump don't get the help.

630
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,960
That dude's got no brains, anyhow.

631
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:04,640
Let Captain Oveurs wife
know what's going on.

632
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,410
This weather bulletin
just came off the wire.

633
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,820
- What can you make out of this?
- This?

634
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:17,050
l can make a hat or a brooch
or pterodactyl...

635
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,860
- Hello?
- Mrs Oveur?

636
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,900
Yes, this is Mrs Oveur.

637
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:35,800
This is Ed Macias at the airport,
There's trouble on your husband's flight,

638
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,100
We don't know how serious it is,

639
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:41,280
but Steve McCroskey thought
you'd want to come over,

640
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,850
Yes. l'll be right down.

641
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,620
l've got to go to the airport. You can
let yourself out the back door.

642
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,160
There's juice in the refrigerator.

643
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:07,440
Doctor says the sick people are getting
worse. We're running out of time.

644
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,180
l've got to concentrate,

645
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,080
l've got to concentrate,

646
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,650
Hello?

647
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,120
Echo!

648
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,450
Pinch hitting for Pedro Bourbone,

649
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,760
Manny Mota,

650
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,100
- How you doing, honey?.
- Jack, l'm so hot, l'm burning up.

651
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,360
l'll turn on some air.

652
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:48,710
- What's going on?
- Close the window!

653
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,550
Chicago, the passengers
are panicking. When do we start down?

654
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,990
Not yet. You'll be in radar range
any second now.

655
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,990
They should have been in range
10 minutes ago.

656
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:05,630
Gunderson, check the radar range.
Anything yet?

657
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,100
About two more minutes, chief.

658
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:16,040
- They could be miles off course.
- lmpossible! They're on instruments.

659
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,420
This is going to be a real sweat.

660
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,650
Gunderson,
let me know when you get anything.

661
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,090
- Got a cigarette, Nels?
- l can't take much more of this.

662
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,560
Looks like l picked the wrong week
to quit amphetamines.

663
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:39,400
- How about some more coffee?
- No, thanks.

664
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:42,040
These reporters want a statement.

665
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:45,870
- How much longer can they hold out?
- 30, 45 minutes.

666
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,510
- Who's flying the plane?
- A passenger.

667
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:53,210
He's an experienced air-force pilot.
No cause for alarm. Take over.

668
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,880
- What kind of plane?
- lt's a big, pretty white plane

669
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:02,390
with red stripes, curtains
and wheels. lt looks like a big Tylenol.

670
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,730
OK, boys. Let's get some pictures.

671
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,590
This bulletinjust handed to me,
Stricken airliner approaching Chicago,

672
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:55,980
Shana, they bought their tickets.

673
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,910
They knew what
they were getting into.

674
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,220
l say, let them crash!

675
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,660
- Would you like some whisky, ma'am?
- Certainly not!

676
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,080
How are the passengers?

677
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:40,150
l won't deceive you, Mr Striker.
We're running out of time.

678
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,380
- Surely, there's something you can do.
- l'm doing everything l can...

679
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,750
and stop calling me Shirley.

680
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,410
Randy, are you all right?

681
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,750
Oh, Dr Rumack.

682
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,460
l'm scared. l've never been so scared...

683
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,890
And besides,
l'm 26 and l'm not married.

684
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:28,600
We're going to make it.
You've got to believe that.

685
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:31,900
Dr Rumack, do you have any idea
when we'll be landing?

686
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,840
Pretty soon. How are you bearing up?

687
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:37,940
To be honest,
l've never been so scared,

688
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,610
but at least l have a husband.

689
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,860
Stay in formation,
Target'sjust ahead,

690
01:06:57,070 --> 01:07:00,040
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough,

691
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,860
You'll have to decide,
You'll have to decide,

692
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,200
You'll have to decide,

693
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:09,840
Stay in formation,
Target'sjust ahead,

694
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,050
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough,

695
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:16,680
You'll have to decide,
You'll have to decide,

696
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,320
You'll have to decide,

697
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:26,960
Oh, rats! Lost number four.

698
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,490
What happened? What went wrong?

699
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,600
l forgot to check the oil pressure.

700
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,670
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's going to hit the fan.

701
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,970
l told him to watch that
oil temperature. What's he doing?

702
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:45,150
Stiker, that plane can't land itself.

703
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:48,980
Ease off. lt's not his fault.
lt could happen to any pilot.

704
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:50,480
lt happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

705
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,050
Can't push him too hard. Might break.
Remember who you're dealing with.

706
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,290
Nick, Pete, Jerry,
there's a fire in the barn.

707
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:01,760
He's right.
l can't take the pressure.

708
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,630
l was crazy to think
l could land this plane.

709
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:10,740
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- l don't care. l don't have what it takes.

710
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:14,640
They'd be better off with someone
who's never flown before.

711
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,880
Bad news. Fog's getting thicker.

712
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,250
And Leon's getting larger.

713
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,750
l know what you're going to say,
so save your breath.

714
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:03,560
Well, l don't have a thing to say.

715
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,560
You've done the best you could.

716
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,260
You really have. The best you could.

717
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,870
We can't expect to win them all.

718
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:19,270
l want to tell you something l've
kept to myself through these years.

719
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,380
l was in the war. Medical corps.

720
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:28,480
One night, they brought in
a badly wounded pilot from a raid.

721
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,840
He could barely talk.

722
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,180
He looked up at me, he said,

723
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:38,480
'"The odds were against us up there,
but we went in anyway.

724
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,560
''l'm glad.
Captain made the right decision.''

725
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,630
The pilot's name was George Zip.

726
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,470
George Zip said that?

727
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:57,170
The last thing he said to me,
''Doc,'' he said, ''Sometime...

728
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,880
''..the crew is up against it.

729
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:03,180
'"The breaks are beating the boys.

730
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,620
'"Tell them to give it all they've got

731
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,320
''and win just one for the Zipper.

732
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,900
''l don't know
where l'll be then,'' he said...

733
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,200
''but l won't smell too good,
that's for sure.''

734
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,570
Excuse me, Doc.

735
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,670
l've got a plane to land.

736
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:40,610
You'd better stay up there a bit,
When the fog lifts, we'll bring you in,

737
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:42,880
l'll take it, Elaine.

738
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:55,030
Listen, Dr Rumack says the sick
people are in critical condition.

739
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:58,200
Every minute counts.
We've got to land now.

740
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:02,530
Don't be a fool, Striker. You know
what a landing like this means.

741
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,540
l'm ordering you to stay up there!

742
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,580
No dice, Chicago.

743
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:09,550
l'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.

744
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,620
l guess the foot's
on the other hand now.

745
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,580
He'll never make it in this soup.

746
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,350
But it's his ship now. He's in charge.

747
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,500
He's the boss, head man, top dog,

748
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,930
- big cheese, head honcho...
- Captain, look at this!

749
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:31,770
''Passengers certain to die.''

750
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:34,100
''Airline negligent.''

751
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,380
There's a sale at Penny's!

752
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,580
l'll need three men up in the tower.
You, Neubauer, you, Macias.

753
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,790
Me John. Big tree.

754
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:48,650
Striker, we're going to the tower.
Good luck.

755
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:52,720
- We're going to the tower.
- The tower! The tower!

756
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,290
Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

757
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:02,360
Stewardess, how soon till we land?

758
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,400
lt won't be long now.
Try not to worry.

759
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,820
We're all ready, sir. Captain
McCroskey, this is Captain Roberts.

760
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:26,890
Captain Kramer, Captain Colosimo.
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Gantz.

761
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,890
Captain Kramer, Captain Gantz.
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

762
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:33,000
Colosimo, you work the relay.

763
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,290
Roberts, check air traffic.

764
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:38,730
Get that finger out of your ear.
You don't know where it's been.

765
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,840
- Steve!
- Got a cigarette, Nels?

766
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,910
Linda, your husband and the others
are alive but unconscious.

767
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,150
Just like Gerald Ford.

768
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:54,520
There's a chance we can save them
if Striker lands that plane in time.

769
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:57,520
- That isn't much of a chance, is it?
- l don't know.

770
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,460
We're doing everything we can.
Now excuse me.

771
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,960
Where did you get that dress?
lt's awful!

772
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,170
And those shoes and that coat! Geez!

773
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,070
8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

774
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:23,410
We're now at 2,000 feet
beginning our descent,

775
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:28,150
- Pour every light onto that field.
- lt's being done.

776
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:35,890
Tower to all emergency vehicles,
runway is niner.

777
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,530
Airport vehicles,
take positions one and two,

778
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,900
Civilian equipment, number three.

779
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,630
Air force, positions four and five,

780
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,210
All ambulances go to number three,

781
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,470
Air lsrael, please clear the runway,

782
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:01,410
ln a moment, we'll ask you
to assume crash positions.

783
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:04,450
Life jackets are under your seat.

784
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:09,820
Place it over your head. When l give the
word, pull the cord on the right side flap.

785
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:15,170
Your seat cushions are also equipped
with a flotation device.

786
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,570
WZAZ in Chicago,
where disco lives forever,

787
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:26,780
Your altitude's too erratic.

788
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,490
You can't come straight in.
You've got enough fuel for two hours.

789
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,790
l'll take it, Elaine.
Listen to me, Kramer.

790
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,860
We have people up here who will die
in less than an hour.

791
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,430
l may bend your airplane,
but l'll get it down.

792
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,930
l'm putting the landing gear down.

793
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,070
- The passengers are ready.
- Thanks, Randy.

794
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,400
You better leave, sweetheart.
You might get hurt up here.

795
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:04,610
- Ted...
- Yes?

796
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:08,990
l wanted you to know... now...

797
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,280
l'm very proud.

798
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,820
Tell them the gear is down
and we're ready to land.

799
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,670
The gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

800
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,410
All right. He's on final now. Put out
all runway lights except niner.

801
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:36,350
Captain, maybe we ought
to turn on the searchlights now.

802
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,950
No.

803
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,850
That's just what they'll
be expecting us to do.

804
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,260
l want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

805
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,930
Now listen carefully. You'll see
the runway at 300 feet.

806
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:03,270
Aim to touch down a third of the way.
A slight cross wind, so be ready.

807
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:08,810
lf you land too fast, use your emergency
brakes. Red handle's right in front.

808
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,280
lf that doesn't stop you...

809
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:20,190
lf that doesn't stop you,
cut the four ignition switches.

810
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,160
Can you see us now?. You should
be able to see the field.

811
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,680
- Sure is quiet out there.
- Yeah, too quiet.

812
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,950
Looks like l picked the wrong week
to quit sniffing glue.

813
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,900
There it is.

814
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,700
There he is!

815
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:08,000
- You're coming in too fast.
- l know, l know!

816
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,040
He knows, he knows!

817
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,280
Below 700 now. Still going down.

818
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:21,050
675, 650, 625, he's holding.
No, he's down, he's down.

819
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,290
Sound your alarm now.

820
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:27,960
Now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

821
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,230
Put down 30 degrees of flap.

822
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:44,100
Listen to me. Remember your brakes
and switches. Get ready to flare it out!

823
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,080
He's all over the place.
900 up to 1 ,300 feet. What an asshole.

824
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:52,980
More left rudder, Put down more flap,

825
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,320
Just kidding!

826
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,430
Striker, lift your nose,
Straighten your wings,

827
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,570
Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

828
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,930
He's coming right at us!

829
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:17,370
Coming in too hot.
Ease up on the throttle.

830
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:22,340
Watch out for that cross wind,
Level it out, Dip your left wing,

831
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:29,560
You're drifting, Keep your eyes
on the far end of the runway,

832
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,720
You're too low, damn it!

833
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:37,230
Watch your stall speed,

834
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,130
Flare it out!

835
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:46,770
Ease her down. Down!

836
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,970
The brake! Pull the red handle!

837
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,990
l want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

838
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:12,730
Flight 209 now arriving at gate eight,

839
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:15,700
Gate nine,

840
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:17,340
Gate ten,

841
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,170
Pull out of it! Push that button!

842
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,320
Gate 13,,, Gate 1 4,

843
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,880
Gate 15,,,

844
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,860
Auntie Em! Toto! lt's a twister!

845
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:51,060
Gate 23, 24, 25,,,

846
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:17,960
l want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

847
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:25,100
Striker?

848
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:29,500
- Striker, are you all right?
- Yeah. We're OK.

849
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:34,640
That was probably the lousiest landing
in the history of this airport.

850
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,550
But some of us, particularly me,

851
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:41,920
would like to buy you a drink
and shake your hand,

852
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,800
And, Ted, when the going got rough,,,

853
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:55,260
Have a nice day. OK.

854
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:58,600
Have a nice day and thank you
for flying TransAmerican.

855
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:04,340
Loneliness, that's the bottom line,
l was never happy as a child,

856
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,980
Christmas, what does that mean
to you? Mine was a living hell,

857
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:12,680
Do you know what it's like to fall
in the mud and get kicked in the head

858
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:15,120
by an iron boot?

859
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:19,920
Of course not. lt never happens. Sorry.
That's a dumb question. Skip that.

860
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:27,560
There you go. Have a nice day.

861
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:46,180
Municipal bonds, Ted.
l'm talking double ''A'' rating.

862
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,550
Best investment in America.

863
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,350
Well, l'll give him
another 20 minutes, but that's it.

864
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:26,020
ENGLlSH

865
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


866
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
