130
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,152
别那么天真了，雅瑟

131
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:37,947
我们每人都有道德选择

132
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:40,700
早睡早起

133

Yes. Thank you.

I remember when we first met.

194
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,935
It was during the war.
是战时的事

you knew how to use your fists.</i>

203
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:05,585
<i>I didn't go there that night to fall in love.
I just wanted a couple of drinks.</i>
我并非往那里找情人
只想喝几杯

204
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,587
<i>And suddenly, there she was.</i>

to make sure I wasn't dreaming.</i>
我得叫这厮捏我

我们谈天、说笑和跳舞

210

I guess I still don't.
我不想那晚结束，现在亦然

211
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:44,679
Enough about me. I hope
this hasn't been boring for you.
我说够了，希望没把你闷坏

212
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,559
But whenever I talk about Elaine, I get
so carried away. I lose all track of time.
但每当说起绮莲，我都很投入
浑然忘记了时间

213
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:53,688
Would you like to order dinner?

-祖儿吃牛扒，我们则吃鱼
-我何时可以参观驾驶舱？

The pilots are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.
机师现在很忙

216
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:03,364
Aw, gee whizz!

Like my men.

I could be so happy.

to that little seafood place and...
不如明天我们去吃海鲜

-你何时回来？
-我不能说，是机密

236
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:30,970

I worry about you so much.

但爸说你在防守方面做得不够

他经常说你甚至不回防

自从我在大学开始

Elaine, just hear me out.
绮莲，请听我说

283
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:38,700
When it did, it was almost like...

like each new day was created
only for us.

The mind plays tricks on you.

但沉医生说你一周后可以出院

for George Zip.
但愿我能这样跟薛佐治说

耐心一点吧！
没有人预期你会立即忘记此事

304
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:06,496

00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,160
How many times have I warned
about food inspection?
已警告过你多少遍要检查食物

502
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,880
You'd think
someone would listen to you.
还以为有人会听你说

503
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,200
Well, airport management,
the FAA, and the airlines...
机场管理层、飞管局
和航空公司…

504
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,320
they're all cheats and liars.
他们都是骗子

505
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,880
All right. Let's get out of here.
好，走吧

506
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,280
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for someone with flying experience.
抱歉，我想找懂驾驶飞机的人

507
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,520
When they built those roads,
they didn't think about drainage,
他们筑路时，没考虑去水问题

508
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,320
so we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.
故我们要乘特制吉普车往大路

509
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,160
We were lucky to get a jeep,
since, just the day before,
很幸运我们找来吉普车

510

It had a bad axle...
之前一天
我们那辆吉普车坏了

Excuse me, sir.
There's a problem in the cockpit.

513
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,400
The little room where the pilot sits.
That's not important.
即机师坐的小房子，算了

514
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,960
The first officer is ill. The captain needs
someone to help him with the radio.
副机师病倒了
机长想找人帮忙

515
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,840

I flew in the war years ago.

-我不懂得驾驶飞机
-可否跟我来？拜托

518
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,520
The stewardess said...

- Both pilots?
- Can you fly this plane and land it?
-两名机师？
-你能否令这飞机降落？

520
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,280
- Surely, you can't be serious.
- I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.
-你说笑吧？
-我是认真的，请别推辞

521
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,000
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr Striker's the only one.
医生，我问过所有人
只有史先生合适

522

- I flew single-engine fighters.
-你有什么飞行经验？
-我驾驶过单引擎战机

523
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,720

It's an entirely different kind of flying.
这飞机有四个引擎

It's an entirely different
kind of flying.
是截然不同的飞行经验

any kind of plane in six years.
我已有六年没接触任何飞机

526
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,520
Mr Striker,
I know nothing about flying.
史先生，我并不懂得驾驶飞机

527
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,680
But I do know that you're the only one
on this plane who can possibly fly it.
但我知道你是飞机上
唯一可能驾驶它的人

528
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,760
You're the only chance we've got.
你是我们唯一的希望

529
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,840

Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

- We'll need a free-landing flight check.
- It's your wife.
-我们要检查自动降落航机
-是你的太太

535

fed, the yard watered, the gate locked.
我要孩子九时上床、喂好狗儿
替院子洒水、锁上大闸

No, he can't do that.
The risk of a flame-out's too great.
不，他做不来，起火机会太大

-有可能吗？
-机会微乎其微

-我认识这人
-真的？他是何方神圣？

the war. It won't make my job easier.

但他越帮越忙

flight leader, up to a point.

felt too much inside.

Maybe you know that kind.

on a particular mission.

Let's just hope
that doesn't happen tonight.

泰德，你在此做什么？

That's what I'm trying to tell them.
我正努力告诉他们这一点

绮莲，我没时间转弯抹角

Everyone is in a desperate situation.

Mr Striker is the only hope we got.

Those are the flaps.
This is the thrust.

but what other choice have we got?

Let's face a few facts.
I flew with Striker during the war.
告诉你，我曾在战时与史合作

588

Let him get the feel
of that airplane,
让他有信心驾驶飞机

593

right down to the ground.
然后令他安全着陆吧！

to quit drinking.

You can work them direct
from here, Captain.
上尉，你由此直接跟他们说吧

597
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,320

Captain Rex Kramer speaking.
史泰德，我是祈力斯上尉

All right.
It's obvious you remember me.
很好，你仍记得我

600
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,960
What do you say we forget about
everything, except what we must do?
不如我们忘记一切，放眼现在

601
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,800
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.
少来这套了

602
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,040
You know I've never flown a bucket
like this. I'll need all the luck there is.
你也知我从没驾驶过这种飞机
一切唯有靠运气

Stand by, Striker.
准备好，史泰德

Our one hope is to build this man up.
I've got to give him confidence.
我们要令他有自信
觉得自己可以胜任

- No, never.</i>
-驾驶过多引擎飞机吗？

Shit! It's a goddamn waste of time.
岂有此理！这简直浪费时间

你是他们唯一的希望

610
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,440
All right.
好吧

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,560
Striker, you listen,
and you listen close.
史，你好好听着

612
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,440
Flying a plane
is like riding a bicycle.
驾驶飞机就像骑单车一样

613
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,960

in the spokes. Get the feel of the plane.</i>
只不过是较复杂一些

Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

All right.
Disengage the automatic pilot.
好，先拆去自动机师

616
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,000
Make no violent control movements
like you did in the fighter planes.
就像你驾驶战机时般
别令飞机强烈摆动

All right.
I'll unlock the automatic pilot.
好，我会放走自动机师

compared to a fighter.</i>

It's perfectly normal.</i>
别担心，这是正常的

and leave you free for flying?</i>
可否找人来负责无线电通讯？

01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,120
You really have. The best you could.
真的，你已尽了力

748
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,600
We can't expect to win them all.
凡事岂能尽如人意

749
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,720
I want to tell you something I've
kept to myself through these years.
告诉你我保守了多年的秘密

750
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,720
I was in the war. Medical corps.
我在战时是军医

751
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,560
One night, they brought in
a badly wounded pilot from a raid.
有一晚他们送来一名重伤机师

752
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,840
He could barely talk.

753
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,040
He looked up at me, he said,
但他望着我说

754
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,160
"The odds were against us up there,
but we went in anyway.
“我们形势不利
但还是勇往直前”

"I'm glad.
Captain made the right decision."
“我很高兴
上尉作出正确决定”

756
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,920
The pilot's name was George Zip.
那机师的名字叫做薛佐治

757
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,600
George Zip said that?
薛佐治说的？

758
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,080
The last thing he said to me,
"Doc," he said, "Sometime...
他最后对我说： “医生…”

759
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,640
"...the crew is up against it.
“队员都全力以赴”

760
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,840
"The breaks are beating the boys.
“我们虽然受到挫折”

761
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19,120
"Tell them to give it all they've got
“但告诉他们要倾尽全力”

762
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,640
"and win just one for the Zipper.
“为部队胜出一仗”

763
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,040
"I don't know
where I'll be then," he said...
“到时我不知道
自己会身在何处”

764
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,120
"but I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."
“但肯定已全身发臭”

765
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,320
Excuse me, Doc.
医生，失陪

766
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,280
I've got a plane to land.
我要令飞机着陆

767
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,760
<i>You'd better stay up there a bit.
When the fog lifts, we'll bring you in.</i>
留在上空，待大雾消散才降落

768
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,920
I'll take it, Elaine.
绮莲，让我来

769
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,560
Listen, Dr Rumack says the sick
people are in critical condition.
听着，雷医生说病人情况危殆

770
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,600
Every minute counts.
We've got to land now.
每分每秒都很重要
要现在降落了

771
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,760
Don't be a fool, Striker. You know
what a landing like this means.
别傻了
你也知道这样降落结果会如何

772
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,680
I'm ordering you to stay up there!
我命令你继续在上空

773
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,640
No dice, Chicago.
不行

774
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,480
I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.
现在由我话事，我们要降落了

775
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,440
I guess the foot's
on the other hand now.
现在他反客为主了

776
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,200
He'll never make it in this soup.
这样大雾，他是不会成功的

777
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,800
But it's his ship now. He's in charge.
但现在由他话事了

778

01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,160
Stewardess, how soon till we land?
小姐，尚有多久才降落？

789

It won't be long now.
Try not to worry.
快了，别担心

We're all ready, sir. Captain
McCroskey, this is Captain Roberts.

Roberts, check air traffic.
罗，看看航空交通

795
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,040
Get that finger out of your ear.
You don't know where it's been.

796
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,920
- Steve!

-史堤
-尼斯，有香烟吗？

莲黛，你的丈夫

Just like Gerald Ford.
就像福特

There's a chance we can save them
if Striker lands that plane in time.
若史及时降落
我们便有机会救他们

800

- I don't know.
-但机会不大吧？

Now excuse me.
我们已尽了力，失陪

好，已进入最后阶段
只亮起九号跑道的灯

to turn on the searchlights now.
上尉，我们或许该亮起搜索灯

833

be expecting us to do.

小心听着，在三百英尺高度
你便会见到跑道

在跑道三分一位置时着陆
有微风，准备好

brakes. Red handle's right in front.
若着陆得太快，用紧急煞掣
即右前方的红色手掣

839
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,880
If that doesn't stop you...

If that doesn't stop you,
cut the four ignition switches.
就熄掉四个引擎

be able to see the field.
看到我们没有？

to quit sniffing glue.

844

Below 700 now. Still going down.

849
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:15,800

Sound your alarm now.

Now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

Put down 30 degrees of flap.

and switches. Get ready to flare it out!
听着，煞掣，按钮，准备

854
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,640
He's all over the place.
900 up to 1,300 feet. What an asshole.
他一时在九百英尺
一时在一千三百英尺，真是笨蛋

855
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,440

靠左，风门翼更加偏侧

856
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,480
Just kidding!

Straighten your wings.</i>

He's coming right at us!
他向我们冲来！

860
