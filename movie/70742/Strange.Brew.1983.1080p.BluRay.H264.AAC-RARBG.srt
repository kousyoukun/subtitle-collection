1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,637
- Hey, growl, will you, lion?
- Come on. Make some noise, you knob.

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,265
- Yeah, we got to start the movie.
- You need to keep growling.

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,643
I think he's bummed out.

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,939
- Stick a pin in his bum, eh?
- No way.

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,733
- What are you on, Valium?
- Maybe I ought to crank his tail?

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,318
- Great.
- That'd start him up.

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,533
Start up. Come on, eh? Start up.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,863
Maybe we ought to call Marlin Perkins, eh?

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,949
Get Wild Kingdom here, eh?
Come on. He's getting mad.

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,235
- Yeah.
- Oh, jeez. We better get going.

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,827
Okay, do the theme, eh?

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,881
- Good day. Oh, do our new movie theme, eh?
- Yeah, okay.

13
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,631
Beauty, eh?

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,799
Okay. Good day. I'm Bob McKenzie.
This is my brother Doug.

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,969
- How's it going, eh?
- Welcome to our movie, eh? Okay.

16
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,179
- Our topic is movies.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,639
Okay, first off,
the difference between movies and TV, eh?

18
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,482
Okay. Go to TV.

19
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,976
This is the difference
between TV and movies, eh?

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,530
- So?
- Okay, go back to movies.

21
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,072
- Now that hoser's growling.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,568
Take off, will you? We're doing our movie.

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,662
Don't wreck our show, you hoser.

24
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,834
- Okay, another topic. Zoom out, eh?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,705
We'll show them how big the screen is, eh?
Zoom out. Go.

26
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,673
- Look how huge it is, eh?
- Okay.

27
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,923
Like, normally, we just have
"Great White North," eh?

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,496
But look, we got--
What's that over there?

29
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,261
Okay, like,
England and Ireland and France, eh?

30
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,969
He's a genius, eh? He knows the atlas.
Okay, and over here we have--

31
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:41,136
- Uh, Russia and Hawaii.
- Okay. All hosers in Russia and Hawaii...

32
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:45,019
- ...and England, welcome to our movie.
- How's it going, comrades?

33
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,688
We made-- Zoom back in, eh?

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,608
Okay, so we made a movie, eh?
So we're going to show that now.

35
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,033
- Yeah.
- Okay.

36
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,699
Wait. First they got to--
You got to interview me, the director.

37
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,156
- I've got to put up the screen, too, eh?
- Don't forget.

38
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,037
Okay, zoom in on me, the director.
Come on.

39
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,866
I directed, too, eh?

40
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,711
Yeah, well, I have to give them
my theory on movies, eh?

41
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,007
Okay. Here's my theory on movies.
You want to know how to wreck a movie, eh?

42
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,264
Take a jar of moths into the theater, eh,
and, like--

43
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,427
Sorry.

44
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,934
And then, like,
release them at a point in the movie

45
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,679
when you know what happens, eh?

46
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,601
And all the moths will fly up to the
projection booth window, cloud it up...

47
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,401
...and you can demand your money back.

48
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,065
- Okay, zoom out, eh?
- Beauty idea.

49
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,033
This movie was shot in 3-B,
three beers, and it looks good, eh?

50
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,025
- Get it?
- Hoserama. Call it Hoserama.

51
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,407
Okay, so we made a movie.

52
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,994
So sit back, get some corn,
and let's have-- It's movie time.

53
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,202
- Okay, turn it on.
- Okay.

54
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,629
Give them enough time
just to see, okay.

55
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,424
Okay, then,
"10 years after World War Four."

56
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,049
- "2051." No. More.
- What? No.

57
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,586
- 2051, the future.
- They saw it already.

58
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,140
- Take off.
- The next century.

59
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,564
I was the only one left on the planet
after the holocaust, eh?

60
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,891
Hey, Hoser, go.

61
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,190
The Earth had been, like, devastated
by nuclear war.

62
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,980
Like, Russia blew up the U.S.,
and the U.S. blew up Russia, eh?

63
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,896
- The Statue of Liberty.
- Psst, act!

64
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:18,408
Lucky for me, I'd been off planet
on vacation at the time of the war, eh?

65
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,366
There wasn't much to do.
All the bowling alleys had been wrecked.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,000
So I spent most of my time
looking for beer.

67
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,461
One day, I was out
looking for a nice place

68
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,587
to build a city for my children,

69
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,634
when I spotted a mutant
in the forbidden zone.

70
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,301
I landed my vehicle to pursue
and destroy this genetic freak

71
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,850
before he could warn other mutants
in the underground caves.

72
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:48,142
I was kind of like a one-man force, eh?
Like Charlton Heston in Omega Man.

73
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,101
Did you see it? It was a beauty.

74
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,651
Fleshy-headed mutant, are you friendly?

75
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,938
No way, eh?

76
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,451
Radiation has made me
an enemy of civilization.

77
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,701
Alpha Base, this is Bob McKenzie.

78
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,748
I've spotted a fleshy-headed mutant
in Sector 16B.

79
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,330
Ow! Take off, you hoser.

80
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,000
Dude, what happened? Film broke.

81
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,418
Got to fix it, eh? Sorry, film--

82
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,128
- Sorry.
- I can't see, eh?

83
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,508
- Turn the lights on.
- It was his fault. He wrecked it.

84
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,926
- It was not. We had a lot of popcorn, too.
- Oh.

85
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,215
Okay, you cover, I'll fix the film, eh?

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,850
Oh, I'm getting whiplash
from my burps, eh?

87
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,057
Okay.

88
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,604
Aw, nice going, you knob.

89
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:38,152
- Hey! What kind of movie is this?
- Okay. Here's how to get--

90
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,738
Zoom in on me.

91
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,534
Zoom in on this.
Okay, here's how to get free beer, eh?

92
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,871
Get a baby mouse,

93
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,664
and, like, put it in a bottle...

94
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,328
...and when it's so small,
it'll fit in, like, this hole, eh?

95
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,498
And then--

96
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,456
Hey! They did this on their album.
Rip-off.

97
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,627
- Will you shut up?
- Ah, you shut up.

98
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,220
- Maybe with some spit--
- We won't be able to fix the film, eh?

99
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,053
Here's what happened in the film, eh?
After I was chased-- Take off.

100
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,679
After I chased the van, eh,
he took me back to his--

101
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,347
Don't tell them the film, eh?
You're supposed to show it.

102
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,426
But we can't show it, eh,
'cause it's wrecked.

103
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,231
Just show it like this, eh?
Just hold it up.

104
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,685
Zoom in on this, eh? Zoom in.

105
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,726
- Oh, jeez, that's a good idea, eh?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,529
That's it. We're leaving, kids. Come on.

107
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,074
- Okay.
- Hey, sit down.

108
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,987
- We're getting out of here.
- No way.

109
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,066
- Oh, come on.
- How come everybody's going, eh?

110
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,621
I don't know. It gets better, eh?

111
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,044
What a waste of money.

112
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,122
Where's the manager?
Get me the manager.

113
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,908
I hope you're proud of yourselves.

114
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,581
- Take off, eh?
- How come everybody's so ticked, eh?

115
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,091
I don't know, eh, but we may as well
really wreck this movie now.

116
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,594
- Your moths?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,471
Here we go, eh?

118
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,723
Oh, boy.

119
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,484
You take the beer and--

120
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,277
A six-pack.

121
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,105
Oh, my God! Why don't you fry--

122
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,374
Well, then how about
a couple of passes to a real movie?

123
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,288
Can you believe this?

124
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,456
- Let's get out of here, okay?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,826
You hoser.

126
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,252
Not that way. We'll get killed. This way.

127
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,466
They've been saving their allowance
for weeks to see this movie.

128
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,809
What am I supposed to tell them?
What the heck am I supposed to tell them?

129
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,976
We're real sorry.
Here's some money back, eh?

130
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,845
It's only $15. Take it. It's yours.

131
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,772
Take off. That's Dad's beer money, eh?

132
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,442
Hey, look!
They're giving refunds in the alley.

133
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,069
Get 'em!

134
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,674
- Uh-oh. Watch out. Cops!
- What?

135
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,670
- Cops!
- This is the police.

136
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,432
I'll come back for you.

137
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,473
Good thing
I'm still wearing that jock, eh?

138
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,182
- Wait up, eh?
- You hurry, you hoser.

139
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,176
That's them. Get them!

140
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,265
- Who's driving?
- You drive.

141
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,610
There's a lot of cops around.

142
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,284
Okay. Thanks.

143
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,487
- It's $20.
- Beauty.

144
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,623
- Why are you going this way?
- There's a shortcut.

145
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,495
Roadblock. Go that way.

146
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,833
- I told him to go the other way.
- I'm sorry.

147
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,249
Let's move it.

148
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,498
We know. We're moving.
My brother's drunk.

149
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,380
- I am not, eh?
- Yeah, you are, too.

150
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,917
Come on. Let's go.

151
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,952
First come, first served.

152
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,963
Come on. Give me one.

153
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,424
- No way.
- Give me one.

154
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,884
Take one, then that's it for you.

155
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,184
Give me the church key. Beauty.

156
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,930
Here. Come on.

157
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,355
Here, boy.

158
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,663
Save one of those beers for me, eh?

159
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,804
He's guarding the beer.
What are we gonna do?

160
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,719
- Bribe him.
- Give him a doughnut.

161
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,928
He likes jelly.

162
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,059
- Jelly doughnut coming.
- Okay, Hosehead.

163
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,311
- You'll like this.
- It's a jelly doughnut.

164
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,847
- Get it over there.
- Okay. Beauty.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,060
Quick, get a glass. Beauty.

166
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,402
What the hell's going on in there?

167
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,687
Just getting your beer.

168
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,288
- You take it to him.
- No way.

169
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,083
- You take it to him.
- No, you.

170
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,330
No.

171
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,578
- You take it.
- I'm letting go.

172
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,040
I'm letting go of the beer.

173
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,210
- You're taking it.
- No.

174
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,458
- I'm letting go.
- I'm letting go.

175
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,754
- Let it go.
- Okay, fine.

176
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,130
Now what?

177
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,878
- Dad, Bob broke your beer.
- No, I didn't. Doug broke it.

178
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,933
- It was you.
- Clean up the mess, boys.

179
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,465
I want you hosers to get me
a fresh case of beer

180
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,059
first thing in the morning.

181
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,059
We're going to need some money.

182
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,234
Use the money
I gave you today, you idiot.

183
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,983
Way to go.
You gave away the money.

184
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,237
What's going to happen
if this plan don't work, eh?

185
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,203
The old man'll boot us out,
and we'll have no place to sleep.

186
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,664
I could live in the van, eh?
I don't need a place to sleep.

187
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,775
You need money to live
or you'll starve.

188
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,582
This plan sucks. I ain't going in.

189
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,245
You are, too, or I'll tell
the old man you gave away his money.

190
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,285
Okay. You boss me around.

191
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,794
- 'Morning, George.
- How are you, Paddy?

192
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,802
Give me 12 fresh
Yukon Gold, please.

193
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,474
$7.90, please.

194
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,764
That horse ran like a bum yesterday.
See you tomorrow.

195
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,559
Okay, take it easy.

196
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,016
Well?

197
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,774
- Elsinore.
- Twelve.

198
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,976
- Twenty-four.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

199
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,516
Twenty-four Elsinore beers.

200
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,939
- Twenty-four.
- Yeah.

201
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,691
$14.70.

202
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,990
I believe there'll be no charge
on this two-four of beer, thank you.

203
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,584
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

204
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,329
We found this mouse
in a bottle of Elsinore beer...

205
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,365
...that we bought at your beer store, eh?

206
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,999
And we heard, like, when that happens
that you get your beer free.

207
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,003
It's in the
Canadian Criminal Code, eh?

208
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,920
Like there's legal precedent set
in cases in law.

209
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,837
- So, like, give us our free beer.
- You want free beer? Go to the brewery.

210
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,391
Now get out of here
before I put the two of you in a bottle.

211
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,885
Are you sure
you don't want to think this over?

212
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,433
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

213
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,601
- We're going.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,769
See you.

215
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:21,217
Jeez, there's a lot of arrows, eh?
"Elsinore Castle. Elsinore Brewery.

216
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,085
"Royal Canadian Institute
for the Mentally Insane."

217
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,313
- Hey, that's the loony bin, eh?
- Yeah, it sure looks spooky up there.

218
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,925
I don't like it at all.

219
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,349
Where should we go? Loony bin or brewery?

220
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,229
I'm taking you to the loony bin.

221
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,895
I'm going to the brewery.

222
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,824
- No way. Go to the brewery.
- All right.

223
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,692
Then I'm taking you to the loony bin.

224
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,331
Holy jeez! Look at that.

225
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,083
Help!

226
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,710
Holy jeez!

227
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,085
Jeez! What should we do, eh?

228
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,417
- Get me out of here.
- Hold it, hold it.

229
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,592
Her tires are insulators.

230
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,220
Don't get out of the car
or you'll get electrocuted.

231
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,598
- He hooked up our stereo, eh?
- I can't get out. The doors are stuck.

232
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,386
- You know what we got to do, eh?
- What?

233
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
- Ram her from behind. Come on.
- What?

234
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,864
- Who's driving?
- You are.

235
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,362
In case she sues for whiplash,

236
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,734
I don't know you.
I'm just a hitchhiker, eh?

237
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,491
- You won't sue for whiplash?
- Hurry.

238
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,304
- Hey, thanks a lot.
- Okay.

239
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,257
- See her looking at me?
- She thought you were some kind of freak.

240
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,849
- Let's go.
- Take off. She likes me, eh?

241
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,055
No way.

242
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,395
What happened?

243
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,766
There's a power surge
at the main gate.

244
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,822
We lost picture, but we have it back.

245
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,026
Is she here?

246
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,657
Yes. She's not alone.
She's got two guys with her.

247
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,033
Lawyers.

248
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,619
I knew this would happen.
Don't let them in.

249
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,325
They're already in.

250
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,655
Damn distortion. What is it? That's twice.

251
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,871
- Where is he?
- Oh, he's back in the thing.

252
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,764
- Yes?
- She's here.

253
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,520
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I--

254
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,185
Ted just said she had lawyers with her.
I thought we should discuss it.

255
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,856
I did not say they were lawyers.
You said they were lawyers.

256
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,074
They don't look like lawyers to me.

257
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,371
- You have the check?
- Yes, it's right here.

258
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,200
- Did her mother sign it?
- Yes, she did.

259
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,116
- And you know what to do?
- Yes, yes, I know.

260
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,836
- It's real big, eh?
- Yeah.

261
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,216
Now don't get scared.

262
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,473
Just think of all the free beers
we're going to get. Come on.

263
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,733
- Good morning. May I help you?
- Yeah.

264
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,281
We have an appointment
with that guy there, eh?

265
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:34,238
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Elsinore passed away recently.

266
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,365
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

267
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,084
Yes, well,

268
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,827
we made the appointment
with the deceased quite some time ago, eh?

269
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,171
We were away on business.

270
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,835
- How long ago was it?
- When did he die?

271
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,761
- I beg your pardon?
- Wait.

272
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,053
Okay. You know his replacement, eh,
like, the new boss?

273
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,255
We made the appointment with him, eh?
What's his name again?

274
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,100
I'm afraid that's
private company business.

275
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,557
I see. Well,

276
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,356
perhaps one of these
would refresh your memory, eh?

277
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,526
Well, the day after he died

278
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,118
his brother Claude married his wife
and took over the entire brewery.

279
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,950
But there is a daughter.

280
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,251
- Go, eh?
- It's my last one.

281
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,667
Go.

282
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,298
It's a jelly.

283
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,966
She just turned 21
and legally inherits the whole brewery.

284
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,967
So she's the new boss?

285
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,056
However, today I've asked Pamela
to drop by so that we could present her

286
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:47,017
with this honorarium and
the temporary share transfer agreement.

287
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,649
In other words, you're buying her out.

288
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,855
Nobody's buying anybody out, Henry.

289
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,486
This is a temporary arrangement,
to relieve her of the burden of ownership

290
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,700
so she can continue with her studies.

291
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,751
Do you want to be relieved
of the burden of ownership?

292
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,503
Well, I don't know.

293
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,171
$5 million is an awful lot of money.

294
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,670
My mother might have accepted
your proposals, but I don't.

295
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,762
Forget it, Uncle.
I'm taking over the company.

296
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,603
There's a legal question to consider here.
Excuse me.

297
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,390
Essentially, this is a vote of trust.

298
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,017
- Come on. We're lost.
- Shh.

299
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,439
- We're lost.
- It's a big brewery.

300
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,188
- Keep quiet.
- Give me my hat.

301
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,492
You're not going to get it back.

302
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,617
Keep quiet.

303
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,414
Who are you?

304
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,541
Yes, we have an appointment
with the president, the new president,

305
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,878
not the one who died, eh, of the brewery.

306
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,045
Mr. Claude Elsinore.
Perhaps you've heard of him?

307
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,013
Come on. I'll show you.

308
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,721
Do you know who that is?

309
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,887
- Who?
- It's Jean LaRose.

310
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,215
Montreal Canadien Rookie of the Year
two years ago.

311
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,231
- He doesn't play hockey no more.
- He's a cop.

312
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,353
He knows you're lying about the mouse.

313
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,100
He'll arrest you. I'll be a witness.

314
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,612
I got that guy's hockey card at home.
I'll show it to you.

315
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,066
Looks like LaRose picked up
those two hicks.

316
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,740
But you don't know how to run a brewery.
Who'll handle the day-to-day operations?

317
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,332
Henry ran it for my father.
He can run it for me.

318
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,418
I'll help all I can. Excuse me.

319
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,004
I just don't want to step on Smith's toes.

320
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,210
Who?

321
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,419
What? We're having a meeting.

322
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,716
These gentlemen here say
they have a meeting with you, eh?

323
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,264
When? What meeting?

324
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,967
- Hey, whiplash. How's it going?
- Just fine, thanks.

325
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,638
- What's the reason for this?
- Are you Claude Elsinore?

326
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,057
Yes.

327
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,225
Well, we found this mouse
in a bottle of your beer, eh?

328
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:52,855
We were at a party, and a friend of ours,
a cop, had some and he puked.

329
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,610
And he said, come here and get free beer
or he'll press charges.

330
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,697
Henry, could this have happened?

331
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,366
Well, not so long ago when there were men
on the bottling lines,

332
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,906
this sort of thing didn't happen.

333
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,711
So let's get some men
on the bottling line.

334
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,715
Welcome to 1984,
the age of automation and unemployment.

335
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,470
The rise of the machine
and the fall of man.

336
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,808
The end of the human era.

337
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,354
You don't know what I'm talking about.

338
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,437
What? We can't hear you.
We got these things in our ears, eh?

339
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,364
Big Brother is watching you.

340
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,323
Here, put these on. Safety requirements.

341
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,235
Your job is to watch
the bottles on this line.

342
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,275
Watch them for mice.

343
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,487
- What's my job?
- Help him.

344
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,876
- You got an opener?
- Yeah. I stole this.

345
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,140
- It's open.
- Two at a time.

346
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,425
- Beauty.
- Cheers.

347
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,348
- To our new jobs.
- Yeah, beauty.

348
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,108
Let me see what you've got.

349
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,694
Okay.

350
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,321
Good. Now, bring the lunatics
from the institute.

351
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,330
I want to see how the drug
in the beer is affecting them.

352
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,913
They're responding to the sounds.
Watch this.

353
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,079
Okay, basically it's the same system
with a new addition.

354
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,001
Specific tones...

355
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,962
...are still linked to motivation,
but now we've added color distinction.

356
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,087
So, object A will attack object B,
or black will attack white, or vice versa.

357
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,916
I'll try the whole thing out tomorrow.

358
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,341
- Same concentration of formula?
- Mmm-hmm.

359
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,221
That means we are right on schedule.

360
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,849
Just one more test,
and then we are ready for the world.

361
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,057
Light them up.

362
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Thank you.

363
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,000
You know, Pamela, I don't want you
to think that your mother and I

364
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,248
don't understand how you feel
about losing your father.

365
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,219
If it had been me who died,
you'd be over it by now.

366
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,797
It's easy to wallow in self-pity.
The hard thing is to go on living.

367
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,643
We'll always have our memories.

368
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,927
The Colonel's dead.
Here we are still enjoying his chicken.

369
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,647
Don't you think it's a little unusual
to get married so soon after the funeral?

370
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,243
More bean medley, dear?

371
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,662
Where did you boys get all this beer?

372
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,038
You stole it, didn't you?

373
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,874
- I'm calling the police.
- No way. We got jobs.

374
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,380
This was free beer, Dad.
There's more outside.

375
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,503
- How much more?
- Oh, about 10 or 12 cases.

376
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,380
We got jobs at Elsinore Brewery.
We work there now, eh?

377
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,126
Do you hear that, honey? They got jobs.

378
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,881
They got free beer.

379
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,314
We're in his good books now, eh?

380
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,524
Yeah, well, let's not blow it

381
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,394
by sleeping in and being late
for our first day at work, eh?

382
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,864
- Why don't we stay up all night?
- Beauty idea.

383
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,355
Honey, phone the neighbors.

384
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,323
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

385
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,358
Hey, George, the boys got jobs.

386
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,412
- Are you crazy?
- Shut up.

387
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:17,496
- What's going on out there?
- Damn it, McKenzie, shut up.

388
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,540
Good morning, Elsinore Brewery.

389
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,669
I'm sorry, he doesn't work here anymore.
Thank you.

390
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,430
They were here when I got here.

391
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,426
- Guys.
- Shut up, Ma.

392
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,722
Oh, jeez.

393
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,944
Good day. We got here too early, eh?
We were just waiting.

394
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,984
Where's Henry Green?
Weren't you supposed to meet him here?

395
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,769
Jeez, I just got up, eh? I don't know.

396
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,742
Okay. Come along now.
You can't leave this mess here,

397
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,244
so I'll show you the way to the cafeteria

398
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,906
and then we'll try
and find Henry Green, okay?

399
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,872
- Get up. Jeez, you hoser.
- Take off.

400
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,781
Well, if there's no staff,
there's no reason to have a cafeteria.

401
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,161
Jeez, I told you we brought too many
doughnuts, eh? This is spooky in here.

402
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,539
- It's like a ghost town, isn't it?
- Yeah.

403
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,504
- You hoser.
- Take off.

404
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,877
Look out, eh?

405
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,128
And the lights don't work.

406
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,675
Hey, check this out. There's sandwiches
and smokes in these machines, eh?

407
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,013
Here's an old Galactic Border Patrol game.

408
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,389
Jeez, you got Joe Louis,
and, jeez, is that tuna or what?

409
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,718
Plugs don't work.

410
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,136
Hey, give me some quarters.
I'm gonna have chocolate milk.

411
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,521
- Forget it, hoser, the power's turned off.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

412
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,650
There's a door here. It's locked.

413
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,937
Do you have a credit card?

414
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,321
- Yeah, but I--
- She's got a credit card.

415
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,698
- Give it to me. I need it.
- He needs the credit card, eh?

416
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,025
- Okay, here.
- Okay, coming, credit card.

417
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,788
- Jeez, travel, eh? Here you go.
- Beauty.

418
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,285
He once got our dead battery going
by mixing birds' feces

419
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,088
and spit, 'cause there's acid in it, eh?

420
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,837
So, do you travel quite a bit?

421
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,924
Beauty.

422
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,223
Bingo. Lunch break.

423
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,511
Holy jeez. Jackpot.

424
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,523
How did you do that?

425
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,733
Oh, I know some stuff
about electricity, eh?

426
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Hey, here's a chocolate.

427
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,524
Cheers.

428
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,698
Hoser, this is four months old.

429
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,533
What is it?

430
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,080
The power's on in the old cafeteria.

431
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,924
- Our nosey little friends?
- It must be them.

432
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,417
I think it's time
the little lady and I had a chat.

433
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,181
Sorry I ralphed, Pam.

434
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,271
You shouldn't have had
that chocolate milk.

435
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:28,353
I know. Sorry about your sweater.
You can take it out of my pay if you want.

436
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,567
- That's okay.
- Jeez, you're real nice.

437
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,282
If I didn't have puke breath,
I'd kiss you.

438
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,737
Hey, Pam.

439
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,655
- Your name's on this machine.
- What?

440
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,123
You got to level six,
I only got to level five. Beauty playing.

441
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,785
- I never played that game before.
- Well, your name's right here.

442
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,919
- Not a bad score either.
21-10-59.

443
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:55,384
- That's right.
- That's my birth date. October 21, 1959.

444
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,005
My name is gone.

445
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,256
- Who's John Elsinore?
- My father.

446
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,058
Fresh as a daisy. Hey, can I play?

447
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,143
Sure, go ahead. Ow! This thing's hot.

448
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,942
Jeez, you better check this thing.
Look, the plug's glowing.

449
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,900
- Miss Elsinore?
- Hey, Rosie.

450
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,278
- Mr. Smith is waiting for you.
- Where is he?

451
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,414
In the brewery room.
I can show you the way.

452
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,202
No, thanks. It's okay.
I can find my way myself.

453
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,867
- Okay, see you guys later.
- Hey, thanks for the jobs, eh?

454
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,446
Yeah, we'll work real hard.

455
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,711
Hey, Rosie, will you sign a hockey card?
I brought it from home.

456
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,083
- Where'd you get that?
- I collect them.

457
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,302
But I already had the gum, eh?
Sign it, "To Bob McKenzie, my good pal."

458
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,513
Put "Rosie the Rose."
I know you like being called Rosie, eh?

459
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,965
- How did Pam's dad die?
- He was electrocuted.

460
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,097
Take off. He's signing my card.

461
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,224
Hey, that was a great hat trick
you got against Czechoslovakia, eh?

462
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,642
Sorry about that nervous breakdown
you had.

463
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,851
I guess it kind of screwed up your career.

464
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,941
You had a nervous breakdown, eh?
Me, too, when he was born.

465
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,490
- Take off, you hoser.
- You take off, you knob.

466
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,988
Okay.

467
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,697
Good morning, Miss Elsinore.
I'm Brewmeister Smith.

468
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,331
My condolences to you
on the loss of your father.

469
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,251
I appreciate your sympathy,

470
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,498
but I came here
to talk about my plans for the brewery.

471
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,598
It's really your brewery now, isn't it?

472
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,942
Oh, well, I'm very flattered
that you think I'm that important.

473
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,864
But of course it's not true.
I'm just an employee.

474
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,070
Really?

475
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,243
Well, who employed you
to install surveillance cameras?

476
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,825
You see, the brewery business
has become very competitive these days.

477
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
So security is extremely important.

478
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:57,039
What made this brewery great is that
my father ran it as a family business.

479
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,592
I'm afraid you have two weeks notice,
Mr. Smith.

480
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,632
You must be out of your mind, young lady.

481
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,675
It takes experience to run a brewery.
You have none.

482
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,966
I don't plan on doing it alone.

483
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,449
Henry, I want to talk to you.

484
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,204
All right, let's not get excited.

485
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,498
I'm the president of the company.
I'll just hire you back. She has no--

486
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,333
She has the right. She has 51 percent.
That's all the right she needs.

487
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,629
You're right.
Well, what are we going to do?

488
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,088
I have a plan.

489
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,429
Oh, no. No, I want no rough stuff.

490
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,097
Remember, that was our deal. I--

491
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,727
I mean, we had a deal.

492
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,190
- I don't have the stomach for it.
- You stinking hypocrite.

493
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,278
You murdered your own brother.
You had the stomach for that.

494
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,242
The second time. You murdered him first.

495
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,114
He was already dead when I killed him.

496
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,371
I can't go through with that again.
There'll be police, questions.

497
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,834
- I'll crack. I know I will.
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

498
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,906
We are not going to kill anybody.

499
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,041
Excuse me,
we're ready for the exercises.

500
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,208
Good.

501
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,246
You're going to conduct those experiments
with her walking through the brewery?

502
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,051
Suppose she sees something?

503
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,132
- Where are the fools with the mouse?
- They're with Henry Green.

504
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,473
Put them in the game.
Take it to level five.

505
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,469
- Level five?
- Level five.

506
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,809
Do it.

507
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,639
Take this. We've got work to do.

508
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,363
I have to go along with this.

509
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,869
But don't worry, you won't get hurt.
Your equipment should protect you.

510
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,333
Being on the same team as you
is all the padding I need, Rosie.

511
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,997
- Are you okay?
- You okay, hoser?

512
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,124
I am your father, Luke.

513
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,171
Give in to the dark side
of the Force, you knob.

514
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,665
He saw Jedi 17 times, eh? Beauty.

515
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,723
Better go to your goals.

516
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,307
Have a good game, eh?

517
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,012
Where's the puck?

518
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Oh!

519
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,138
The power of the Force stopped you,
you hosers.

520
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,441
Cover your shorts. Don't get deep.

521
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,649
Stick on the ice.

522
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,455
That was no goal, you know.
They were in the crease.

523
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,961
Come back and fight, you hosers.
Come on, eh?

524
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,801
Get off.

525
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,428
My left nut.

526
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,058
Careful.

527
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,765
It's all right. It did that before.

528
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,437
Now, I think he just pressed
one of these buttons here.

529
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,110
- What are you doing?
- It'll just take a moment.

530
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,409
There. You see that?
You see that number? April 4.

531
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,333
That's the day he died.

532
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,792
Wait, look.

533
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,456
That's the tape
they showed at the inquest.

534
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,219
Look.

535
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,362
They killed him.

536
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,449
It looks that way.

537
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,633
Yeah, well, yours are sucky white skates
like a figure skater, eh?

538
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,875
Well, yours are like referee skates.

539
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,007
At least figure skaters
know how to skate, eh?

540
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,343
Hey.

541
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,143
Somebody horked our clothes.

542
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,273
Jeez, who'd want to hork our clothes, eh?

543
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,475
Maybe a couple of these guys got sick
and tired of wearing their pajamas, eh?

544
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,016
- No, they're all on the ice.
- We'd better report this to our boss.

545
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,281
No. Hey, let's go see
if there's a lost and found, eh?

546
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,823
- No, let's report it to our boss.
- No, lost and found's a better idea.

547
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,831
Oh, wow.

548
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,174
- Have you ever been in here before?
- Yeah.

549
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,508
But I've never seen this stuff before.

550
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,470
You certainly don't need
any of this kind of hardware to make beer.

551
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,312
You aren't going to find
the lost and found here.

552
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,558
- I told you that was a mistake.
- I'm skating there, you know.

553
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,606
It's faster.

554
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,775
Ow!

555
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,647
Jeez, those things hurt.

556
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,702
- Who's that?
- Smith's assistant.

557
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,833
Look at this. Every camera on the place
is tied into this console.

558
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,962
- That's us.
- Yeah.

559
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,134
They don't even trust themselves.

560
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,930
It's the guys.

561
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,180
- Are you sure we didn't kill them?
- Just shut up. I have this all worked out.

562
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,148
Ted.

563
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,028
You stupid idiot.
Now he'll be asleep for two hours.

564
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,789
- Beer shower.
- Don't waste it.

565
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,455
Here.

566
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,753
- You asked for it.
- Take off. You hoser.

567
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,298
I told you.

568
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,343
We take them to the loading dock
and put them in beer kegs.

569
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,550
Hurry.

570
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,847
Oh, jeez, look at this place.

571
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,110
- Jeez, what is this, eh?
- It's a nuclear bomb shelter. Come on.

572
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,898
Let's get bombed.

573
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,736
There's probably
beer here somewhere.

574
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,454
Holy jeez! There's a guy over there.

575
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,962
There's the game we were in.
Hey, what's with this guy, eh?

576
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,124
Hey, you.

577
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,495
- You killed him. He's dead.
- I just--

578
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,051
- I'm a witness. Police!
- I didn't do nothing.

579
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,005
- My brother's a murderer.
- Take off.

580
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,013
He's not dead.
Look, his stomach's moving.

581
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,258
Maybe he's just sleeping, eh?

582
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,560
Maybe he's gonna puke.
He had too many beers.

583
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,684
- Where are the beers?
- I'll find them.

584
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,097
Jeez, here's the organ
they were using, eh?

585
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,867
Hey.

586
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,329
Hey, look. Bootlegs.

587
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,035
No wonder everything's secret here.

588
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,615
They're cutting pirates.

589
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,922
Hey, this piano's got a computer, eh?

590
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,297
I don't know how to work it, eh?

591
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,927
Figures you wouldn't know
if it's got a computer.

592
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,354
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Wizard. You know it.
- Let me try. I'm a genius.

593
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,266
Okay, watch this.

594
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,814
These hosers
are skating around in a circle.

595
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,438
Hey, beauty.

596
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,817
- That song's making them fight, eh?
- Yeah. Do it again.

597
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,501
Delvecchio's hurt Gretzky.
They're in the dressing room,

598
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,955
finding out what's to be done.

599
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,085
Pulford and Holman
have been fighting terribly.

600
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,002
Frank Mahovlich's one
of the strongest guys in the league.

601
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,882
He made out okay. What a fight.

602
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,179
Oh, now somebody's thrown
an octopus on the ice

603
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,513
and Litzenberger and Salming are--

604
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,676
How are the brakes?

605
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,346
They got two stops, then no brakes.

606
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,188
Good work.

607
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,029
Listen, about that shooting business.

608
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:52,617
- I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean it.
- Yeah, okay. Right.

609
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,014
- You boys have a nice nap? Well--
- How's it going?

610
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:12,094
You're doing a great job for me here,
but I have a special assignment for you.

611
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,470
My daughter, you know, Pamela,

612
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,888
she's having her birthday,
and I want to deliver a couple of kegs.

613
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,638
Very special kegs, for the party.

614
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,980
Jeez, these got beer in them,
these big kegs?

615
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,816
Beer? Oh, yes, beer for the party.
Now, look.

616
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,033
Here's a map, and you must
follow this route precisely

617
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,276
because otherwise you'll get lost,
and she'll be disappointed.

618
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,948
- Where are you guys going, eh?
- What? Get out of here.

619
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,237
Hey, Rosie. We're going to Pam's birthday.
You coming?

620
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,081
It's a business trip.
They're going on a business trip.

621
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,417
So we just go down
to Lakeside Park here, eh?

622
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,753
Yes. It's right at the bottom of the hill.
You can't miss it.

623
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,880
It's right at the bottom of the big hill.

624
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,757
You'd better get started
or you'll be late.

625
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,344
- Okay, eh?
- I'll go with you, eh?

626
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,932
No, you open the door.

627
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,013
- Open the door.
- We're going to get loaded.

628
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,139
Open the door. Come ahead, boys.

629
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,852
Hurry.

630
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,749
Oh, look, everything's under control.
Don't worry, I took care of it.

631
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,999
- So I heard.
- Yes.

632
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,045
Do you mind?
You're a little crowded here.

633
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,764
Just let me out, please.

634
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,804
Send those lunatics back to the institute.

635
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,468
We have to follow the van.

636
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,756
- Back to the institute!
- Do as I say. Hurry.

637
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,560
We have to follow the van. Go back.

638
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,939
Follow the van?

639
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,694
Oh, just to make sure.
That's a great idea.

640
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,856
Get in.

641
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,693
I'll drive.

642
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:01,742
- Did you feed Hosehead this morning?
- No. I forgot. He was sleeping, eh?

643
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,162
- Well, make up your mind, eh?
- Yeah, he was sleeping.

644
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,329
Well, maybe we ought to go home
and feed him, eh?

645
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,009
- In case the party goes all night?
- We got two kegs.

646
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,762
What are you doing?

647
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,680
Just testing the brakes, eh?
They felt a little soft.

648
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,493
- Where are they going?
- I don't understand it.

649
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,863
I gave them a map. It was all very clear.

650
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,031
Follow them.

651
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,374
Don't be a hog.
We just have time for one quick one.

652
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,712
Okay.

653
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,959
- Last one in the house is a big idiot.
- Take off.

654
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,643
I win, eh?

655
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,221
Nice going.

656
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,057
Oh, jeez.

657
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,347
Take a look at this.
Dad really got into the beers, eh?

658
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,560
Where are they?

659
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,900
Mom? Dad?

660
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,439
- Let's see if they're in their room.
- Don't push.

661
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,240
Come on. Mom! Dad!

662
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,068
- Take off, eh?
- Get out.

663
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,409
Sorry.

664
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,829
I didn't know they were in there.

665
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,366
Can you believe it?

666
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,794
Get his bowl quick,
or he'll kill us.

667
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,419
Yeah, he's got
a funny look in his eye, eh?

668
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,795
What the stink are they doing in there?

669
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,813
Would you like me to tilt your chair back?

670
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,097
Shut up.

671
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,274
Twenty cans ought to be enough, eh?

672
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,267
We're going to a party.
Don't eat the furniture.

673
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,534
- I got to get some new underwear.
- Jeez, bootlegs.

674
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,944
Remember where we got this?

675
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,202
It was where they were running off
them pirates, eh?

676
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,447
Was that a dream?

677
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,117
It was no dream. It was in your underwear.

678
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,947
- Okay, let's see.
- What are you going to do?

679
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,619
It's one of them new square records, eh,
that goes, like, on a--

680
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,671
On a record player that's, like,
on its side, eh?

681
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,544
No way. That's an EP
from some British New Wave band.

682
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,342
Take off. You don't know.

683
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,835
Yeah, they bootleg those, eh?

684
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,916
What do you think?

685
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,094
- Sounds like a British New Wave band.
- Yeah. Beauty sound.

686
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,433
- Beauty.
- Not my style of music, eh?

687
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,234
Hey, Hosehead. Here's another one
for your collection, eh?

688
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,444
Beauty. Hank Aaron. Wonder if he can hit.

689
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,732
There they are.

690
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,568
- Hey, who's driving?
- I am because you're too loaded to drive.

691
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,448
Take off. I am not.
Just getting warmed up for the party, eh?

692
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,325
You can't drink and drive
at the same time, hoser.

693
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,032
It's nice to get away
from the brewery once in a while.

694
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,403
Take a little drive, you know?

695
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,865
Hey, did you ever notice that in movies

696
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,583
when they're driving, they don't look
at the road for a long time?

697
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,826
- Jeez, no, I'd never noticed that.
- Yeah.

698
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,038
That's because they're being towed, eh?

699
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,882
- Really?
- By a rig.

700
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,398
- We have them now.
- Just like I told you.

701
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,624
What's going on? Will you stop this thing?

702
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,453
The brakes aren't working.

703
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,046
- Try the parking brake, eh?
- Take off. The parking brake never worked.

704
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,005
These cops are going to arrest us.

705
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,599
- No point in steering now.
- Take off. You steer this thing.

706
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,775
The wharf. The end of the wharf.

707
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:19,914
Help!

708
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,713
You'd better call an ambulance.

709
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,055
- All right now. Come on.
- Careful now.

710
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,238
- Easy.
- Come on, get the rope off her.

711
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,906
They're down at the end of the wharf, sir.

712
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,243
All right. You better follow us there.

713
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,084
Hey, you guys, follow him.

714
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,957
I'll call an ambulance.

715
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,013
- Put her down right over here.
- Let me get a blanket.

716
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,006
- We got a cover.
- She's all right.

717
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,521
Back off. Let's have a look here.

718
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,894
You all right?

719
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,110
- Okay, she's fainted. Call an ambulance.
- It's on its way, sir.

720
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:43,076
Down there ten minutes?
Nobody can last that long.

721
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,793
Not Houdini, not nobody.

722
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,791
- Hey, hoser.
- What?

723
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,840
Okay, that's it. That's enough.

724
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,916
Those big cons are going to love you, eh?

725
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,181
- What do you mean?
- You're a cute little guy.

726
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,973
They're going to be loving you
from dawn until dusk.

727
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,177
Turn!

728
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,430
- Where are you going to be?
- I'll be in the cafeteria selling smokes.

729
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,016
All right, single file.
Down here. Step it up. Move it.

730
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,558
- They're going to kill us all.
- Hands in your pockets.

731
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,072
Back against the wall.

732
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,185
Feet together. Come on, straighten up.
Look straight ahead.

733
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,111
- Straighten up, I said.
- Okay, eh?

734
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,777
That's it. Okay.

735
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,240
Try to pick out the men who kidnapped you.

736
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,039
- That's her.
- Hey, how you doing?

737
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,703
- Come on. Get back there.
- That's her. She was--

738
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,912
- Quiet.
- Okay.

739
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,791
- He can't get any further back--
- Shut up.

740
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,945
- What did the doctor say?
- Catatonic schizophrenia.

741
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,201
What?

742
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,660
Schizophrenia marked by an excessive
and sometimes violent motor activity

743
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,713
or by generalized inhibition.

744
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,459
Sounds like you just picked that out
of the dictionary.

745
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,339
No, that's exactly
what the doctor told us.

746
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,257
I have a photographic memory, you know?

747
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,545
- Really?
- Oh, yes, I never forget a thing.

748
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,811
Well, that might be useful
in my investigation of this case.

749
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,183
Well, feel free
to call upon me at any time.

750
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,024
My compliments on the many fine things
you have in your home.

751
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,860
- Well, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

752
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,823
- Bonaparte.
- Uh, Napoleon, actually.

753
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,028
Yeah.

754
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,910
- What would a thing like that cost?
- Oh, $4,000 or $5,000. I don't remember.

755
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,450
Who chiseled this?

756
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:57,126
It was some sculptor, I think.
I'm terrible on names.

757
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,054
I thought you said
you have a photographic memory.

758
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,340
Oh, well, normally I would, but--

759
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,089
- Darling?
- Ah, my wife.

760
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:10,061
- You didn't tell me we had company.
- I think you know the Inspector, dear.

761
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,723
- Hello.
- My wife.

762
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,312
- How is she?
- She's about the same, I'm afraid.

763
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:18,187
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She hasn't said a word since the accident.

764
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,526
- I hope it's not something that I've done.
- No, of course not.

765
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,153
Well, the Inspector has to leave.

766
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,280
Oh, wouldn't you like
a drink or something?

767
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,857
No, he wouldn't, he'd love to,

768
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,782
- but he has to run.
- Oh.

769
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,910
- Good night.
- Thank you, Inspector.

770
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,584
I hope she'll be able to testify
tomorrow morning.

771
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,959
Who? Oh, yes, we hope so.

772
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,209
- Good night.
- 'Bye.

773
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,933
Chimp here does the killing.
I don't like to kill.

774
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,431
I'm the brains, eh?

775
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,887
We got over $5 billion in our hideout.

776
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,726
Only some of the money's marked, eh,
so we're not spending it.

777
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,113
We're just waiting.

778
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,944
- You guys like a smoke?
- No, eh?

779
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,695
We want our lungs
to be pink when they fry us.

780
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,080
We told them we didn't want a lawyer.

781
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,953
Chimp here would probably
just kill him anyway.

782
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,623
Lawyers are for sucks.

783
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,707
McKenzie brothers. Your lawyer's here.

784
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,307
- You can talk in here.
- Okay.

785
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,558
- Hi, I'm Jack Hawkland, your lawyer.
- How's it going, eh?

786
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,768
How's it going, Mr. Hawkland?
I remember you from the office, eh?

787
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,191
You're very observant.
I'll make this as simple as possible.

788
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,070
The two of you have been charged
with kidnapping

789
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,779
under Section 2471 of the Criminal Code.

790
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,580
The offense of kidnapping
is comprised of two elements.

791
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,544
Both of which must be satisfied
before a conviction may lie.

792
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,995
The first element, actus reus,
which was satisfied on October 10, 1983,

793
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,998
when you, Robert and Douglas McKenzie,
did kidnap one Pamela Elsinore.

794
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:10,132
- Wait a sec. We didn't do it.
- Yeah, that's right. We's innocent, eh?

795
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,011
If you're innocent
then you have nothing to fear.

796
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,063
- Beauty.
- We'll get off, eh?

797
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,527
Exhibit A.
It's an open-and-shut case.

798
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,192
- Shall I time-code it?
- Yes.

799
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,910
Now what about that missing disc?

800
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:41,366
- How did he get the code?
- Random chance.

801
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,285
That's impossible.

802
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,210
Play it back.

803
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,337
Give me magnification on the code pad.

804
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:58,929
That's not our code.
Get me the John Elsinore disc.

805
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,204
Look at this.

806
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,287
What the hell was that?

807
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,684
There's no scientific explanation for it.

808
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,926
It's pointless to worry.

809
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,521
Let me see.

810
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,225
There's 11, 12, 13.

811
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,989
They knew exactly what they were doing.

812
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,119
They took the one disc
that would incriminate me.

813
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,951
What are we going to do now?

814
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,875
We will move towards Oktoberfest
as planned,

815
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,590
and I will not underestimate
our little friends again.

816
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,836
Do you want me to light it up?

817
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,595
No.

818
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:28,563
- Hey, there's Hawkland.
- It's the press. I'll handle them.

819
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:32,231
Mr. Hawkland,
can we just get one quick shot of you?

820
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,362
Mr. Hawkland.

821
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,322
Mr. Hawkland, what--

822
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,002
That's how you handle the press. Come on.

823
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,759
- We're late. Let's go.
- Remind me to pay his bill on time, eh?

824
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,021
- Yeah, Chuck Norris for the defense, eh?
- Beauties.

825
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,896
Your Worship, I wish to plead
my clients guilty to statutes

826
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,689
125 and 233 of the Criminal Code

827
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,531
and not guilty to all other charges
due to mental incompetence.

828
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,828
Objection.
You cannot split pleas like that.

829
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,405
Two bowls of split plea soup to go, eh?

830
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,620
- Is your nose bleeding?
- Yeah.

831
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,420
Your Honor? Mr. Judge?

832
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,254
My brother's got a bleeding--

833
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,959
My brother's got a bleeding nose.
We need some Kleenex.

834
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,590
- Clerk, please.
- Clerk is gonna give you some Kleenex.

835
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,153
And this, sir, is the same tape
that your engineer retrieved

836
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:59,197
from the television cameras
that monitor the activity in your brewery?

837
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,949
Oh, yes. And I'd like to point out

838
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:06,866
that this tape has not been
tampered with or edited in any way.

839
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:12,080
It even has a time-code on it,
and those are very difficult to fake.

840
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:17,344
For the benefit of the court,
would you please explain "time-code"?

841
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,931
Just because I don't know what it is,
doesn't mean I'm lying.

842
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,854
- It usually stops bleeding by now, eh?
- This isn't working.

843
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,767
Give me something quick.
A couple of bullets.

844
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,266
Maybe we should call
the Red Cross or something.

845
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,478
- Here. Try these.
- Good idea. Beauty, clerk.

846
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,491
Beauty.

847
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,069
May I remind you two idiots
that this is a court of law?

848
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,491
He's the one with the bleeding nose.
I didn't do nothing.

849
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,910
Proceed, Counselor.

850
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,250
Would you state your name
and occupation, please?

851
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,460
Doctor B.M. Smith,
Resident Head of Psychiatry

852
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,666
at the Royal Canadian Institute
for the Mentally Insane.

853
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,298
Now, Dr. Smith, we know
you are familiar with this case.

854
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,640
The victim, Pamela Elsinore,
is currently in your care at the RCIMI.

855
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,352
That is correct.

856
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:11,437
Dr. Smith, would you say
that you are sufficiently familiar

857
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,982
with the defendants
to give us a preliminary diagnosis?

858
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:20,490
I am. I would say, without a doubt, that
they suffer from paranoid schizophrenia.

859
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,816
Would you kindly explain to the court
what that means?

860
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:30,832
That is schizophrenia marked by excessive
and sometimes violent motor activity

861
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,286
or by generalized inhibition.

862
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,126
- I do.
- I do.

863
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,214
I guess we're married, clerk.

864
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,759
- Where's the honeymoon?
- Order. Order.

865
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,053
Give me a toasted back bacon,
hold the toast.

866
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,257
Don't make me laugh, eh?

867
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,637
I must instruct you
not to speak unless you are spoken to.

868
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:52,055
He's starting to sound like the old man.
Pretty soon he'll send me out for beers.

869
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,770
All right!

870
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,403
Order! Order!

871
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,567
Until the victim is
mentally fit for trial,

872
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,621
I want these two lunatics

873
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,164
confined under the psychiatric care

874
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,039
of Dr. Smith

875
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:18,496
at the Royal Canadian Institute
for the Mentally Insane.

876
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:22,013
This hearing is adjourned.

877
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,560
- Take off.
- If you put--

878
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,570
- It's my side. Don't go over that line.
- What line? Where?

879
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,733
- There is a line.
- If you put your mouth--

880
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:43,992
Take off. I'm going to do the steamroller.

881
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,993
Take off! No way!

882
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,992
- Steamroller. I'm steamrolling you.
- Take off.

883
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,039
Steamroller!

884
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:05,665
Hi, fellows. My name's Ted,
and I'm happy to be working with you.

885
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,102
Somebody help us, please!

886
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,100
I'll reconnect this.

887
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,599
Forget it. Dr. Smith is doing the lobotomy
in the morning.

888
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,142
Doctor, thank God you're here!

889
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:07,992
We lost him.

890
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,656
What did you give him?

891
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:14,454
This is just the thing,
a hypodermic needle.

892
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:15,994
Excuse me.

893
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,497
Help! Stop that man! Stop him!

894
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:38,064
- $6.50.
- Here. This ought to be worth $6.50.

895
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:40,975
No, I don't want it! $6.50! Hey!

896
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:44,685
I got your license number.
You rich bum! $6.50.

897
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,605
Hey, you! $6.50!

898
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,698
Hey, you! Let me see your ticket! $6.50!

899
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,331
All I've got is two fives.

900
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,788
- Who was in this bed?
- Jean LaRose.

901
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,212
Jean LaRose, the hockey player?

902
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:04,674
- I don't know. Yes, I guess so.
- Is this the available bed?

903
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,745
No, I don't know where he is.
This is the one. He's dead.

904
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,802
- Well, get him out of that bed.
- That's not my job, I'm sorry.

905
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,007
Not your job?
Do you want him to mummify?

906
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,927
You're asking me to do
all sorts of crazy things.

907
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,216
Get the man out of the bed!

908
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,929
It isn't my business anymore.
I won't listen to you--

909
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,056
What have you done with the disc?

910
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,727
What are you looking at me for?
I don't got it.

911
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,150
Maybe it's out of gas, eh?

912
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,406
- You farted!
- No, it wasn't me. It was the chair, eh?

913
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:36,912
- He's lying! Check the machine.
- No. I'm not lying.

914
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:39,743
He's lying, all right.

915
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,752
I don't need no machine
to tell me that, eh?

916
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,924
- I didn't do it, I swear.
- Don't slice cheese in here, will you?

917
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,084
Take off!

918
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:50,421
- All right, come on. Down the hall.
- All right, don't be a bully, eh?

919
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,255
There's those guys who horked our clothes.

920
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,218
How come you're
not playing hockey, eh?

921
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:00,518
- Okay, I know my rights.
- Hey, who's in this room?

922
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,849
- Get away!
- Pam's in there.

923
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,939
- Get away from there!
- Pam is in there. Ow!

924
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,654
All right, don't touch anything.
I'll be right back.

925
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,545
What was that?

926
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,931
Let's get out of here.

927
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,024
- How's that?
- Beauty. Take it up to 30 this time.

928
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,482
No way! My turn! I want to--

929
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:53,901
Okay, eh?

930
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,660
- I'll just disconnect these.
- Hello? No, he went out, eh?

931
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,663
Like he went to get a pizza.

932
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,451
Who is this?

933
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,246
Jeez. The guy hung up. Okay!

934
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,083
Put this in your mouth
so you don't bite your tongue off.

935
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,169
- Beauty.
- Hey, let's try the head this time.

936
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,665
Beauty. Okay.

937
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,915
If you'd stick to your 12-point
maintenance program, eh,

938
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,720
then we wouldn't have
to jump-start you like this.

939
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,934
But, oh, no, you had to do it your way.
You think you know everything, eh?

940
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:25,427
Okay. There we go.
I'm going to take it up to 90 this time.

941
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,385
Hey, get away from there!
Don't touch those things!

942
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,692
No, no! You're always touching things!

943
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,396
- Take off, eh?
- He's party-pooping.

944
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,526
Hey, some guy called for you
while you was out, eh?

945
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,527
- A call for me?
- Yeah.

946
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,655
- Okay, do it now.
- No, no! He'll get mad.

947
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,373
- Oh, come on. What about my turn?
- We're going to do this instead.

948
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,700
- How's it going, eh?
- Shh!

949
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,581
- It's going pretty good.
- Shh!

950
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:56,209
- He doesn't like him much.
- Where's Pam? I got to find Pam.

951
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,972
Jeez, I saw her down the hall before,
but she was dozing off, eh?

952
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,175
Come on!

953
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,427
Come on!

954
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,425
Oh, jeez,
but we have to come back for my turn, eh?

955
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:07,388
One guy just drove away with the car
from here and he gave me this.

956
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,560
Maybe he's a doctor.
And one guy stole the car from over there.

957
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:11,979
My coat, too.

958
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,226
- Okay, let's take a look, sir.
- He was not wearing any clothes.

959
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,241
He was wearing pajamas.
He stole my coat and hit me.

960
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,414
Hey!

961
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:30,673
Pursue him!

962
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:34,167
- But I saw you drown.
- They saved my life.

963
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,341
You saved my life.

964
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,589
What are you doing in here?

965
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,850
Oh, uh, we're from the Department of
Justice, and we're adjusting the beds.

966
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,965
This is Mr. Roy, our consultant.

967
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:52,098
- Two minutes for elbowing.
- Let's get out of here!

968
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,452
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

969
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,963
Where are all these hosers going, eh?

970
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:17,457
- There's a tunnel to the brewery.
- Let's go!

971
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:20,876
- Jeez, I ain't playing hockey again.
- Tunnel to the brewery. Take off!

972
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,050
How convenient!

973
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,361
What is it you want?

974
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,737
What's going on?
Didn't we pay our electric bill?

975
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:43,905
The circuits are fusing.

976
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:47,204
The computers, the surveillance system,
everything seems to be overloading.

977
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,828
- And I think Ted is dead.
- Ted?

978
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,124
- Yes.
- Oh, my God! Look.

979
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:56,039
It's him! It's my brother!
Oh, no, John! He wants revenge!

980
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,090
I know it! He's going to kill us!
I didn't do it! It wasn't me!

981
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,875
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!
Turn this thing off!

982
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:04,129
I should never have listened to you!

983
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,008
Shut up!

984
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,178
I could crush your head like a nut.

985
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:15,521
But I won't

986
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,768
because I need you!

987
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,687
Now, go to the loading dock.

988
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,360
Make sure the trucks leave
for Oktoberfest as planned.

989
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,204
Do as I say.

990
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:43,761
They put some stuff in the beer.
And they make us drink it every day.

991
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,723
My father must have found out about that.

992
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,804
That's why they killed him.

993
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:53,930
- Come on! This way!
- How long is this tunnel, eh?

994
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,482
I'm having a heart attack.

995
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,936
Wait! I want to go to the cafeteria.

996
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,150
You go with her. You come with me.

997
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:07,236
Be careful.

998
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,081
- Don't worry, I will.
- Come on!

999
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,422
See you, eh?

1000
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:19,709
Yeah.

1001
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:21,878
Good day, eh?

1002
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:30,603
Jeez, I'm sure glad we got rid of them.
They were really starting to bug me, eh?

1003
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,603
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah, okay.

1004
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,430
You mean you've never been apart?

1005
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:39,191
No, never. We always stick together.

1006
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,435
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.

1007
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,395
- Where's the other one?
- He's dead, Smith. You killed him.

1008
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,610
Oh, good.

1009
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,700
There's one less to worry about then.
Now come this way.

1010
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,162
Now hurry up!

1011
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:02,786
Hurry up! Come on, let's go! I saw that!

1012
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,179
- This the one stolen from the hospital?
- That's it.

1013
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,190
- Japanese, eh?
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,228
Guess the whole world's made in Japan.

1015
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,807
Could be, sir.

1016
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:41,206
How ironic!
You came here with a mouse in a bottle.

1017
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,920
Now you are the mouse.

1018
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:46,545
- As for you, my dear--
- Don't worry about me, Smith.

1019
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:50,013
I wrote everything I know in a letter
and mailed it to the newspapers.

1020
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,585
When did you do that?

1021
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,010
Very good, my dear.
Cunning, right to the end.

1022
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,181
But, unfortunately,
we find the mail system unreliable here

1023
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,021
so we use private couriers.

1024
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:02,727
Nice try.

1025
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,729
It's really too bad you won't be around
to see the whole world

1026
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,900
become addicted to Elsinore beer.

1027
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:11,991
In a few hours
I will introduce my special formula

1028
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,366
to the public at Oktoberfest.

1029
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,954
When they drink enough
they'll do whatever I tell them.

1030
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,200
You know, people can tell
what's in beer, eh?

1031
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:24,042
My brother can tell the difference between
beers by what his burps taste like.

1032
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,709
Your brother is dead.

1033
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:31,799
But he's not really dead.
I just told him that when you fainted.

1034
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:37,721
Can I buy you a beer?

1035
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,396
Let's run it all again.

1036
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,574
- It's a lot to remember.
- You know what to do?

1037
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,403
- I think so.
- Okay. See you later.

1038
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:50,818
Okay. See you.

1039
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:56,320
My brother and I used to say
that drowning in beer was like heaven, eh?

1040
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:00,449
Now he's not here, and I got two soakers.

1041
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,331
- This isn't heaven. This sucks.
- Don't talk.

1042
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,999
Try and use as little oxygen as possible,
and maybe when the level rises,

1043
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,209
we can get up to that porthole.

1044
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:38,316
I think it's getting warmer in here.

1045
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:42,288
I didn't notice anything.

1046
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,263
No, fellows. No exercises today.

1047
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,983
No, fellows. Forget about it.

1048
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,187
No, look, can we talk this over, fellows?

1049
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,858
No, wait, fellows!

1050
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:16,612
Let me alone! Wait!
You can't do this to me!

1051
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,950
I'm in charge here!

1052
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:09,426
Come on, Doug!
They're in the vat room. Let's go!

1053
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,868
Stand back. This is really going to blow.

1054
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:31,826
Didn't blow. Anybody home?

1055
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,497
I can't believe it. He drank it all!
Help me out.

1056
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:44,465
You've got to help him.
You've got to get him out of there.

1057
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,933
Thanks.

1058
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:51,433
Oh, no! Geez, I have to take a leak
so bad I can taste it.

1059
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:00,188
What are you doing walking around?
I thought you were sick.

1060
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,990
There's a guy back there trapped in a vat.

1061
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,914
- Somebody tried to kill him.
- You stay here. Come on.

1062
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:10,834
Out of the way. Come on.

1063
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,536
- Cops!
- Clear out, clear out.

1064
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:15,666
Holy shit!

1065
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:17,844
- How did he get in there?
- I didn't do it!

1066
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,253
How do we get him out?

1067
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,921
Let's try to cut him out
with a blow torch.

1068
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,669
You couldn't cut that with a torch.

1069
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,681
I don't know.
We need an explosives expert.

1070
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,803
No, don't blow him up!
He's my brother. Please don't hurt him!

1071
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,971
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1072
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,520
He's going to take a leak.
Get out of the way!

1073
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:43,613
Hey, get me out of here, will you?
I got a wiz to throw!

1074
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,534
Boy, that was some belch!

1075
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,697
We thought you were going to take a leak.

1076
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,446
What do you mean?
Just get me out of here, eh?

1077
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,123
- Come on, eh, you hoser.
- I'll get you out.

1078
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:56,078
I would have saved you some,
but I had to save everyone's life, eh.

1079
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:58,129
Yeah, well.
Gee, I don't know how to do this.

1080
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,883
Oh! Not there.

1081
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:02,335
- Okay, how about here?
- Ooh, that feels good.

1082
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,175
I think I'd better go.

1083
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,871
- What the hell was that?
- It wasn't me.

1084
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:15,164
The roof just blew off the institute.
It's on fire.

1085
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:19,293
On fire? Geez!
Hey, can you hold on for a minute?

1086
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:21,877
Yeah, okay.
But hurry, will you, I got to go.

1087
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,923
Yeah. Help me get him out of here.
I've got an idea.

1088
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,465
- Are you done yet?
- Yeah.

1089
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:34,638
Beauty.

1090
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,271
Hey, you did a fine job, son.

1091
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,144
What took you two minutes
would have taken us two hours.

1092
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:43,192
You ever want a job with
the Fire Department, come and see me.

1093
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:44,396
You got it, eh.

1094
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,066
What about my brother?
Can he get a job?

1095
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,494
- You boys want to come with us?
- Where are you going?

1096
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:50,993
- Oktoberfest.
- Geez, I've had enough beer for a while.

1097
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,406
Two trucks full of bad beer
went there this morning.

1098
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,365
We have to stop the people drinking it.

1099
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:57,785
That's a thirsty crowd. It won't be easy.

1100
01:21:57,954 --> 01:22:00,544
Okay, I got an idea,
but we got to go home first, okay?

1101
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,207
- Come on.
- You guys, go with them.

1102
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:05,415
- How come we're going home?
- Don't worry about it.

1103
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,497
Put these clothes on.
I'll tell you about it on the way.

1104
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:08,762
Okay.

1105
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:23,727
Here.

1106
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,567
Elsinore beer,
will go right over there.

1107
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,443
- Okay.
- Right over there, please.

1108
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:29,855
You got it.

1109
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,701
Okay, eh, all cops, eh,
get out of your cars.

1110
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:39,366
Okay. I want to take a head count, uh,
like maybe we'll have some breakfast, eh.

1111
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,037
Some back bacon sandwiches
while we're waiting.

1112
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,287
Okay, another thing. Um...

1113
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,498
You all went through the "Stop" sign
over there.

1114
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,249
And that's a moving violation.

1115
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,260
And my brother and I, uh,
we have a lot of parking tickets.

1116
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:51,723
- Hey, hoser!
- What?

1117
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:56,553
My brother's coming in now,
so, all cops, come on up here now.

1118
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,349
Sit. Okay.

1119
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:00,976
- Got a map?
- Map.

1120
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:02,522
Yeah, right here.

1121
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:06,807
Okay, this is like an aerial view.
Okay, take the 401.

1122
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:11,362
Take the 401 to Kitchener here,
and then take Highway 6 north.

1123
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,988
Because it goes right up here.
That's the off-ramp.

1124
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:15,775
No. Right there's the off-ramp.

1125
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,659
Don't forget to make a right
at Highway 6, eh.

1126
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,826
Yeah. Okay?

1127
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:22,287
When you get there, you can have all
the free beer and sausages you can eat.

1128
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,851
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

1129
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:51,404
We are very happy to announce
that today all the beer is free.

1130
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:58,533
Courtesy from our good friends
at Elsinore Brewery.

1131
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:41,988
Skunk!

1132
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,182
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1133
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:14,823
I wouldn't go in there.
There's a big skunk in there.

1134
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:17,784
We know that.
It's a Toronto skunk. My jurisdiction.

1135
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,196
Right.

1136
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:29,578
It's okay, it's okay.

1137
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,708
Well, boys, it worked.

1138
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:35,126
Worked! I can't thank you enough.
I really can't.

1139
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:39,302
That's, uh, some dog of yours, too.
He's really hungry, isn't he?

1140
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,927
Yeah, he's always hungry, eh.

1141
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,894
We couldn't feed him, eh,
because we was in jail.

1142
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:47,055
- You put us there. Thanks a lot!
- Yeah, we was innocent, too.

1143
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,515
She told you we were innocent.

1144
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,515
- Just a second, boys.
- Okay, Inspector.

1145
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:53,107
Now, maybe,
we can drop the criminal charges,

1146
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:55,153
but, believe me,
that mental incompetence bit

1147
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,316
will be, ahem, tough to beat.

1148
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:58,685
I'll take care of them.

1149
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:02,702
From now on they're working full time
at the brewery for me and Rosie.

1150
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,575
- Beauty.
- Come on.

1151
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:07,083
- Let's go, dear.
- Beauty, eh?

1152
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,245
- Let's go, dear.
- See you, Inspector.

1153
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,667
Pam?

1154
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:15,250
Oh, sorry, eh.

1155
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,085
We was wondering, eh, like, uh,

1156
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:20,512
just exactly
what is wrong with the beer, eh?

1157
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,344
- Is it poison? Like, could it kill you?
- No, no.

1158
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,221
It's not a poison.
It's, uh, more like a drug.

1159
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:28,849
It can wear off in time
like it did with me, eh.

1160
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:32,810
Oh. We was thinking since we're employees
of the brewery now, eh,

1161
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:36,769
like, perhaps
it would be, uh, a good idea for us

1162
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:40,441
to take, like, all the contaminated beer
back to the brewery

1163
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,652
where it can be properly disposed of, eh?

1164
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,992
You know how to handle
one of those big rigs?

1165
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,448
- Geez, a ten-speed!
- Yeah, sure, of course.

1166
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,829
- Like, uh, we drive them all the time, eh.
- Well, take off, eh.

1167
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,497
- Beauty! Come on!
- You're lying.

1168
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:54,882
It's okay, don't worry.
Trust me. Come here.

1169
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,593
- You're lying.
- I want to talk to you.

1170
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,133
- You're tricking me.
- Come here.

1171
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,166
If you're sucking me in--
I knew you would.

1172
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,590
- You're lying!
- Take off!

1173
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,928
- You don't know how to drive this.
- I do.

1174
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:05,843
It's a 10-speed. A five-speed times two.

1175
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,762
We're going to crash.
We'll be in the water again.

1176
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,971
Take off! We are not going to crash, eh!

1177
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:13,103
There's no way I'll crash this.
This is a beer truck, eh.

1178
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:03,485
Oh, jeez!

1179
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:05,856
Good day.
Welcome to the end of the movie, eh.

1180
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,700
- Yeah. How'd you like it?
- Yeah. I'm Bob McKenzie.

1181
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:11,986
- This is my brother, Doug.
- Oh, excuse me. How's it going?

1182
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,037
I was drinking during the beer
because I had such--

1183
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,710
- During the movie, I mean.
- He's loaded, eh. He's gone.

1184
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,165
- Okay, I've had a couple. So?
- Okay. Time for the movie review, eh.

1185
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:23,709
At least I don't have a voice
like Jiminy Cricket.

1186
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,381
Okay. Movie review. Okay.
I thought it was beauty.

1187
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,011
What did you think, Doug?

1188
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:31,887
Well, I thought there were
a couple of, uh, minor, uh, story flaws,

1189
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:36,846
but, all in all, it was a good $5's
worth for me and my whole family.

1190
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:43,858
Okay, I'd like to thank The Academy
for this beer, eh.

1191
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:47,859
It's beauty.
I'll put it on my mantel and, um,

1192
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:52,082
- you know, try to keep it cold. Okay.
- Try and keep dust off it, too.

1193
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:55,833
How 'bout all those people who left early,
eh, when the movie was ending, eh?

1194
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:59,084
They got their cars out now
and you got to see this, eh.

1195
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,420
Beauty.
It's like leaving a ballgame early, eh.

1196
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:05,546
They thought they were going to get out,
instead they missed all this great stuff.

1197
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:06,715
Yeah, beauty.

1198
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:10,183
All these names that are going by,
these guys worked on the movie, eh.

1199
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,795
Like, uh, this guy here. He was beauty.

1200
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:16,599
Mind you, he ate a lot at mealtime, eh.
He was always late.

1201
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:17,768
Here goes another one.

1202
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,185
It's great to do a movie and get to learn

1203
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,605
what all the stuff means,
eh, like "grip," eh.

1204
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,073
I never knew what grips were, eh.
You know what they are, eh?

1205
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:26,113
Guys that wear tools on their belts.

1206
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:28,067
And they live, like,
up in the rafters, eh.

1207
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:30,447
They come early in the morning
and go up there,

1208
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,115
and you don't see them all day.
Then they go out.

1209
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:34,914
They're sort of like
a different breed, eh.

1210
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,159
Or gaffers?

1211
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,959
- You know what a "gaffer" is, eh?
- Living proof of evolution.

1212
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:42,253
He's the guy that, like, you know,
he gaffs. Gaff for us.

1213
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:45,633
That's what a gaffer does.

1214
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:47,964
Okay.

1215
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,796
What? Two minutes is up?

1216
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,469
- Two minutes and holding.
- Okay.

1217
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,468
He's going to blast off in a minute.
You ever seen him do that?

1218
01:29:56,641 --> 01:30:00,061
You ever see at the end of movies,
uh, when they, like, freeze frame?

1219
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,518
Okay, freeze the frame.

1220
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:03,814
Okay.

1221
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:07,528
You ever see in the movies
cowboys ride off into the sunset?

1222
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:11,986
When you heard the whistle blow,
they ride off, ride off.

1223
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,664
Happy trails. See you.

1224
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,696
'Bye now.

1225
