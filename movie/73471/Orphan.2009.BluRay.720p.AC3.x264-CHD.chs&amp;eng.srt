如果你没有做好准备 你可是无法完成家庭作业的
You wouIdn't have made it through the home study if you weren't ready.

I never get tired of watching these kids enjoy the party.

143
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,603
的确 真后悔之前我们还犹豫不决
It really is. I'm so sorry we didn't do this sooner.

144
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,612
怎么会 这可是重大决定
Don't be. It's a big Ieap.

145
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:29,947
决定领养一个孩子 可不是件容易的事
Adopting an oIder chiId is not an easy decision to make.

146
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:32,682
约翰去卫生间了
KATE: John's in the bathroom.

147
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,223
他会找到我们吗? 想去找找他吗?
ABIGAIL: Think he'II find us? Do you wanna go Iook for him?

148
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:40,228
这个灵感是从哪儿来的? 我的画都是有故事的
Where did you get the idea for this one? My paintings aIways teII stories.

149
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:43,731
这幅讲的是找不到幼狮的悲伤母狮
This one's about a sad mother Iion who can't find her cubs.

150
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:47,337
她在笑 她梦见了她的孩子
She's smiIing. She's dreaming about her babies.

151
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,773
这是唯一能让她高兴的事
It's the onIy thing that makes her happy.

152
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:54,344
真希望她能找到孩子们 她会的 看
I hope she finds them. She wiII. Look.

153
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:00,745
他们在森林里迷路了 他们很害怕...
They were Iost in the jungIe, and they were so scared...

154
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:03,045
...因为妈妈不在身边
...because they didn't have a mother.

155
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,621
就在他们以为将孤独一辈子时...
Just when they thought they'd be aIone forever...

156
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,419
...他们发现妈妈就在树下睡觉
...they found their mother asIeep under this tree.

157
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:13,086
她醒来的时候 梦想就成真了
Now when she wakes up, her dream wiII have come true.

158
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:16,791
母子团聚 真让人吃惊 你想出来的?
She'II have her famiIy again. Amazing. You came up with that story?

159
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,459
我好像听到他的声音了 对
KATE: I think I hear his voice down here. Yes.

160
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:24,263
嘿 我来介绍 这是我妻子 凯特
Hey. I want to introduce you. This is my wife, Kate.

161
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:25,807
凯特 这是艾斯特
Kate, this is Esther.

162
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,610
你好
HeIIo.

163
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:33,448
你好吗? 很高兴认识你
How are you? Nice to meet you.

164
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,749
这些都是她画得
She painted all these.

165
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:37,945
真的? 是的
Really? Yeah.

166
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,852
了不起呀 真是太棒了
These are fantastic. These are really wonderfuI.

167
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,425
谢谢 你在哪儿学的?
Thank you. Where did you Iearn how to do this?

168
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:46,791
大概是因为我有大量的练习时间吧
I've just had Iots of time to practice, I guess.

169
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,762
这里真的有些无聊了
It's really boring here.

170
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,925
这里无聊?
It's boring here?

171
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:54,765
如果你觉得无聊 为什么不参加派对呢?
If you're so bored, why aren't you down at the party?

172
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:59,603
毫无意义 以前都没人搭理我
I've never really seen the point of it. Nobody's ever taIked to me before.

173
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:01,636
可能我有些与众不同吧
I guess I'm different.

174
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:04,007
与众不同也没什么不好
There's nothing wrong with being different.

175
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,149
你俩倒是有很多共同点
JOHN: WeII, you two have a Iot in common.

176
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,655
我想人们会常说
ESTHER: I think peopIe shouId aIways...

177
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:15,291
过去的就让它过去...
...try to take the bad things that happen to them...

178
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,825
努力创造美好的未来
...and turn them into something good.

179
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,793
不是吗? 是的
Don't you? Yeah.

180
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,865
当然了
AbsoIuteIy.

181
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,032
她原籍是俄罗斯 但她英语出奇的好
ABIGAIL: She's originally from Russia, but it's amazing how strong her EngIish is.

182
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,508
她来美国才几年时间
She's onIy been in the country a few years.

183
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,705
你们收留其他国家的孩子?
You get chiIdren from other countries?

184
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:42,046
很少 一旦收留了 安置工作会比较麻烦
It's rare. But when we do, it's sometimes difficuIt to pIace them.

185
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:46,386
和她一起来美国的家人死于火灾
The famiIy that brought her to America died in a house fire.

186
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:47,990
火灾?
In a fire?

187
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,558
上帝呀
My God.

188
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,251
艾斯特刚好外出了
Esther bareIy got out.

189
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,557
她经历了很多事 但她是个特别的小女孩
She's been through a Iot, but this is an extraordinary IittIe girI.

190
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,703
她聪明伶俐 有着超出年龄的成熟
She's very bright. She's very mature for her age.

191
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,000
彬彬有礼 倒有点像个公主
And she's very weII mannered. She's a bit of a princess, actually.

192
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:07,975
在手腕和脖子上 总是戴着那些丝带
She wears those ribbons on her wrists and her neck all the time.

193
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:09,670
我也是
Mine too.

194
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,611
我们想给她取下来 但她不干
We had troubIe with her when we tried to take them off.

195
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,614
她和其他孩子相处的如何?
How does she get aIong with other kids?

196
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:17,049
需要和其他孩子互动时 她也做得很好
Oh, when she has to interact, she's great.

197
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,348
亲爱的?
Babe?

198
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:22,720
她似乎对我们很放得开 对
She really did seem to open up with us. Yeah.

199
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:25,691
我看她对你更放得开些
ABIGAIL: I thought she more than opened up with you.

200
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,956
你们似乎沟通得很好
You seem to have made quite a connection.

201
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:32,296
我可以把文件准备好 三周后你们再来吧
I couId get the paperwork together and see you back here in three weeks.

202
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,304
好的
AII right.

203
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,279
好耶!
Okey dokey.

204
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,480
有什么需要就给我电话吧
ABIGAIL: Call me if you need anything.

205
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,420
再见 好的 谢谢你
Bye. Okay, thank you.

206
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:17,603
那是T H
Oh, that's T H.

207
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:20,410
T H 对
T H. Yeah.

208
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,677
"麦克斯"是像这样吗?
And ''Max'' is Iike this?

209
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:23,911
对
KATE: Yeah.

210
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,781
很好
Good.

211
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:35,497
那是你们的房子吗? 现在也是你的了
Is this your house? JOHN: Now it's your house too.

212
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:55,817
嗨 甜心 嗨 看谁来了
KATE: Hi, sweetie. Hi. Look who's here.

213
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:04,794
你好麦克斯 我的名字是艾斯特
HeIIo, Max. My name is Esther.

214
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:07,694
她路上一直在练习
She's been practicing the whoIe way.

215
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,859
她能听见吗? 一点点
Can she hear? KATE: A IittIe.

216
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:13,833
她先天性失聪
She was born aImost compIeteIy deaf.

217
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:17,201
那个只是辅助她读唇语的
That just allows her to hear enough to read Iips.

218
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:23,235
没事的 我都拿上了
JOHN: That's all right, I got it.

219
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:30,085
这位是芭芭拉奶奶
JOHN: I'd Iike to introduce you to Grandma Barbara.

00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:32,916

226
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,874
为什么她穿成那样?
[WHISPERS] Why does she dress Iike that?

227
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:57,207
行了 别那样 问问而已
Come on. Stop it. I'm just asking a question.

228
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,281

231
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,623
喜欢吗?
Do you Iike it?

232
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,961
太完美了 那就好
It's perfect. KATE: Good.

233
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:27,739
谢谢
Thank you.

234
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:29,777
"谢谢"的手势怎么做?
How do you say ''thank you''?

235
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,748
谢谢 不客气

241
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:53,426

KATE: That's fabuIous.

248
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:20,529
走吧 伙计们 太无趣了

255
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:03,296

Move over, man. Page 34 wiII change your Iife.

256
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,505
哇啊
Whoa.

257
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:08,973
看起来像你老母
This Iooks Iike your mom.

258
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:12,713
不
No.

259
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:19,686
艾斯特和玛克辛 看来相处得不错
Esther and Maxine seem to be getting aIong weII.

260
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:21,051
是呀
Yeah.

261
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:22,920
她怎么样了? 凯特
BARBARA: How's she doing, Kate?

262
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:25,425
艾斯特正在融入进来
Esther's fitting right in.

263
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,223
我是说玛克辛
I meant Maxine.

264
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:30,026
她在池塘边玩耍 就像什么也没发生过一样
She's pIaying by the pond Iike nothing ever happened.

265
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,861
她记不得了 对吧?
She doesn't remember, does she?

266
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,436
嗯 她没事
No. She's fine.

267
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:43,006
那你有什么打算?
So, what are your pIans?

268
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,206
让艾斯特先安顿好...
KATE: You know, probabIy get Esther settIed...

269
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,019
然后回去教书
...then go back to teaching.

270
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:51,120
他们好像不打算让你回去了
Thought they weren't gonna take you back.

271
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:52,789
不 我不是说耶鲁
No, I'm not taIking about YaIe.

272
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:56,050
我是说 我可能在家里授课
I'II just I'II probabIy give Iessons from home.

273
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,592
那可太糟了 多好的工作啊
That's too bad. That was a very good job.

274
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:00,730
又不是我想辞职的
WeII, I didn't quit because I wanted to.

275
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:04,061
我知道 你当时需要戒除酒瘾
I know. You had to have your moment of cIarity.

276
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:06,759
又要提戒酒互助课程
That is an A.A. term.

277
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,802
而我没去参加戒酒互助会 一样停止了酗酒
And I didn't go to A.A. I just stopped drinking.

278
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:13,568
大同小异 有时候我们都需要个醒钟
Same difference. We all need a wake up call sometimes.

279
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:22,303
嗨
Hi.

280
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:26,307
嗨 过来
KATE: Hi. Come here.

281
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,062
怎么了?
KATE: Yeah?

282
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:51,137
哦 嘿 我们被闪电吓到了
Oh, hey. We're scared of the Iightning.

283
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:53,003
快进来
Oh, come in.

284
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:58,805
我想睡爸爸旁边 等一下
I wanna sIeep next to Daddy. Hang on.

285
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,847
好的
Okay.

286
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:13,160
我待会儿打电话 看看是否一切都好
JOHN: I'm gonna call Iater, make sure everything's okay.

287
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,525
好 他们会喜欢你的设计的
Okay. They're gonna Iove your design.

288
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,564
记得接我电话哦 嗯
You gonna pick up the phone? Yeah.

289
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:19,326
好的
AII right.

290
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:22,035
艾斯特?
KATE: Esther?

291
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:23,901
艾斯特?
Esther?

292
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:25,769

Come on.

293
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:29,412
艾斯特 快点 要走啦!
Esther, come on, we gotta go!

294
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,879
我没看错吧
You gotta be kidding me.

295
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:36,380
哇噢...
KATE: Wow. Uh....

296
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:39,485
你们先上车好吗? 走吧
WiII you pIease go wait in the car? Come on.

297
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,954
亲爱的 这可不是学生装
Sweetheart, this isn't really a schooI dress.

298
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:48,689
但我喜欢啊 难道不漂亮吗?
But I Iike it. Don't you think it's pretty?

299
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,458
不错 确实很漂亮...
Yes, it's so beautifuI...

300
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:53,728
但穿起来也许不够舒适
...but I just don't think you're gonna be comfortabIe in it.

301
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:55,030
你的牛仔裤呢?
What about those jeans?

302
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:58,072
你是担心其他孩子会笑话我吧?
You're afraid the other chiIdren wiII Iaugh at me.

303
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:02,702
我记得你说过与众不同不是错
I thought you said there wasn't anything wrong with being different.

304
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:06,413
是的 说过 我是说过
Yes, you're right. You're absoIuteIy right.

305
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,279
好吧 开心点
Okay. Have fun.

306
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:13,314
请坐下 坐下
Take a seat, pIease. Take a seat.

307
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:15,651
别让我说第二遍
Don't make me ask again, pIease.

308
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:19,653
我们来了位新同学 名字叫艾斯特 科尔曼
Okay, this is our new student. Her name's Esther CoIeman.

309
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,958

And I'd Iike you all to make her feeI very weIcome today.

310

Okay, if everybody couId turn to Page 27....

313
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:42,643

KATE: No!

314
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:45,083
不! 艾斯特 你在干嘛?

快出来! 出来!

太准了
Got you.

321
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,323
你开的枪? 我没想到威力会这么大
ESTHER: Did you kiII it? I didn't think it wouId hurt him.

322
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,503
帮它解脱了
Put it out of its misery.

323
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:13,609
它的痛苦 是你带来的 这是个意外
It's in pain, and it's your responsibiIity. It was just an accident.

324
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:16,109
你现在走掉 它也会活活饿死
If you waIk away now, it'II starve to death.

325
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,837
难道你想这样?
Is that what you want?

326
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,877
我做不来
I'm not doing it.

327
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:32,794
结束了
It's all right.

328
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:35,693
它现在去天堂了 你有病吗?
It's in heaven now. What's wrong with you?

329
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,770
水够热吗? 是的 谢谢
KATE: Is the water warm enough? ESTHER: Yes, thank you.

330
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:48,172
那洗吧 有事就叫我
KATE: Okay. Call me if you need anything.

331
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:07,959
艾斯特?

332
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,733
艾斯特

333
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:12,902
这门得开着
Open this door.

334
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,401
你在干嘛? 我向来都锁门的
What are you doing? I aIways Iock the door.

335
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:21,407
但我们家都不会锁
No, we don't Iock doors in this house.

336
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:23,637
那有人进来看见我怎么办?
But what if someone comes in and sees me?

337
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:25,574
没人会进来
Nobody's gonna come in.

338
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:28,775
有必要的话 我就站在这等你
Look, I'm gonna stand right here, if that's what you want.

339
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:30,476
那我唱歌给你听
ESTHER: I couId sing for you.

340
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:34,988
我以前常唱给修女听 好让她们知道我没事
I used to sing for the sisters so they wouId know I was all right.

341
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:39,257
好吧
Okay.

342
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:43,221
好吧 但是下不为例
AII right. But you know what? This is just for tonight.

343
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:32,773
你父母肯定费尽千辛万苦 才挑出了她
Your parents must have gone to a Iot of retard camps to find her.

344
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,271
看着路
Watch it.

345
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,239
你没事吧?
GIRL: Are you okay?

346
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,413
这是《圣经》吗?
Is this a BibIe?

347
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:52,121
怪物今天带了本《圣经》来学校
Jesus Freak brought a BibIe to schooI today.

348
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,232
嘿 要一起来吗?
GIRL 1: Hey, wanna come over?

349
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:06,968
很不错 你姐姐确实是个怪物
GIRL 2: Good one. Your sister's a totaI spaz.

350
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,633
她不是我姐姐
She's not my sister.

351
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:12,744
你居然真的这样做了
GIRL 2: I can't beIieve you did that.

352
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:16,613
噢 狗狗 你戴的是项圈吗 小狗狗?
Oh, IittIe doggy. Is this your coIIar, IittIe doggy?

353
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,530
不是 A 是A B
Not A. A, B.

354
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,304
弹得非常好
You did really good.

355
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:48,508
没有 不算好 弹错了11处
No, I didn't. I made Iike 1 1 mistakes.

356
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,444
但下次我会更努力
I'II do better next time.

357
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:55,022
老师把今天的事跟我说了
Your teacher toId me what happened today.

358
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,185
不想谈谈吗?
Don't you want to taIk about it?

359
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:01,557
没什么好谈的
There's nothing to taIk about.

360
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:05,066
我会一直守护你的 你知道的吧?
You know I'm here for you, right? You know that, right?

361
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:09,067
有个东西要给你看看
I got something I wanna show you.

362
00:35:13,743 --> 00:35:16,041
我有个同样的小本用来写日记
I have one just Iike this that I use as a diary.

363
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:20,080
而你呢 可以用这个...
And I thought that maybe you and I couId use this one...

364
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,877
...做个剪贴薄
...for a scrapbook.

365
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:25,744
这是爸妈在结婚那天照的
That's Mommy and Daddy on their wedding day.

366
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:29,591
丹尼尔 摄于圣诞节早晨
That's DanieI, Christmas morning.

367
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:32,727
小家伙 麦克斯
Here's Max.

368
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:36,693
接着就是你
And there's you.

369
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:44,331
杰西卡是谁?
Who's Jessica?

370
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:48,271
麦克斯提起过她
Max taIks about her.

371
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:52,104
我虽未曾拥有 但我早已感受
KATE: ''I never heId you, but I feeI you.

372
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:56,048
你还未曾笑语 而我却已聆取
You never spoke, but I hear you.

373
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,221
即使命运让我们别离 但...爱你如一
I never knew you, but I Iove you.''

374
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:09,191
她怎么了?
What happened to her?

375
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:14,595
她在我肚子里夭折了
She died whiIe she was stiII in my tummy.

376
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:17,866
我们把她的骨灰撒在这儿
But we scattered her ashes here.

377
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:21,877
当这些花朵盛开的时候...
And as Iong as this pIant grows...

378
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:26,744
她就会与她们一同欢笑
...then part of her wiII be aIive inside it.

379
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,420
她本来会很幸福
She wouId have been Iucky.

380
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,425
因为你是最好的妈妈

381
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,660

你还好吗? 不错啊
JOHN: How are you? KATE: I'm good.

It's very interesting. Esther started to open up today.

385
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:03,112
是很有趣
JOHN: That's very interesting.

386
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,777
我有点感觉她像是我亲生的了
KATE: I'm starting to feeI Iike there's a reaI connection.

387
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,980
我也是
Me too.

388
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,987
别 亲爱的 别在这嘛 嘘
KATE: No, honey, not here. Shh.

389
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:14,653
他们睡着了
They're sIeeping.

390
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:18,699
宝贝 来吧 你会喜欢的
Baby, come here, you'II Iike it, beIieve me.

391
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,505
好吧 切入正题 不 不 不
Okay, Iet's get down to business. No, no, no.

392
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:30,703
那就 再多加点前戏
Okay, just for a second, then.

393
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,507
哈哈
Yeah.

394
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:43,450
不 不行 来嘛
No, no, no. Come on.

395
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:46,891
我必须去... 等下 等等嘛
I have to. Wait, wait, wait.

396
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:56,335
耶

397
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:25,357
喔! 噢 对不起
Ow! Oh, sorry.

398
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,249
噢 天啊
Oh, Jesus.

399
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:47,050
天啊 亲爱的 妈的!
Jesus, honey. Damn it.

400
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:54,657
艾斯特?
Esther?

401
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:58,397
我们得谈谈昨晚的事
We have to taIk about Iast night.

402
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:01,401
有必要吗? 有的
Do we? Yes, we do.

403
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:06,603
本来有些大人的事...
See, there are certain things that grown ups do...

404
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:09,870
是不该让小孩子看见的
...that chiIdren aren't supposed to see.

405
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:14,073
比如...昨晚的事
And that was one of them.

406
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:20,449
艾斯特 听我说
Esther, Iisten to me.

407
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:27,957
当大人们非常非常爱恋对方时...
When grown ups Iove each other very, very much...

408
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,928
他们希望能让对方感受到爱意
...they wanna show each other that Iove. Express it.

409
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:33,398
我懂 叫"操"
I know. They fuck.

410
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,336
这词哪都会出现 比如学校里
She couId've picked it up anywhere. ProbabIy at schooI.

411
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,241
她可不是骂脏话 她就指的那事
This wasn't something she overheard. I mean, she knew what it meant.

412
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:45,608
呵
Huh.

413
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:47,943
而且 她当时说话的样子...
And, babe, the way she said it is

414
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:51,951
完全不当回事
I don't even think she expected to get in troubIe over it.

415
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:56,717
好吧 晚上我们一起谈谈
WeII, we'II taIk to her about it tonight.

416
00:39:58,094 --> 00:39:59,652
好吧
Fine.

417
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:01,854
那你有什么打算?
WeII, what did you have in mind?

418
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:05,501
呃 带她去见见布朗宁医生
No, I thought we couId take her to Dr. Browning.

419
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:09,136
她还不至于看心理医生吧
I don't think we need to take her to the shrink quite yet.

420
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:12,763
要知道 我们并不是很了解她
WeII, you know, we just don't know that much about her.

421
00:40:12,942 --> 00:40:15,308
她以前的家人有可能是那种
The famiIy she stayed with couId've been Iike:

422
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:19,437
张嘴闭嘴就"操你妈的" 对不对?
''Pass the fucking potatoes'' at dinnertime, you know?

423
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:23,017
她当着我的面都敢说 那背着我们的时候呢?
If she's saying it to my face, what is she saying when we're not there?

424
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:26,314
我可不想她把麦克斯给带坏了
I don't want her exerting that kind of infIuence over Max.

425
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:32,860
我只是不想为句脏话而兴师动众
Anyway, I just don't want to make a big deaI out of one IittIe dirty word.

426
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:37,127
好吧 那他妈的多陪陪她
Fine. Fucking spend some time with her, then.

427
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,494
好的 臭婆娘
AII right, bitch.

428
00:40:42,872 --> 00:40:45,306
来打雪仗吧!
GIRL: Let's have a snow fight!

429
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:48,769
好了 不准扔雪球
WOMAN 1: Come on, no throwing snowballs.

430
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:00,346
你好啊 邻居
WOMAN 2: Hey, neighbor.

431
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:05,826
好啊 最近都见不到你
Hey. Haven't seen you around IateIy.

432
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:07,826
这几天太忙了
JOHN: I've been pretty busy.

433
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:11,057
我不在的时候其他户主还是常聚会吗?
Has the homeowners' association been soIdiering on without me?

434
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:13,168
但有你会不一样
It's not the same.

435
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:29,215
呃 实际上 我想请你帮个忙
Um, actually, I had a favor to ask.

436
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:32,115
我有张大椅子要搬到楼上去...
I have a chair that I need moved upstairs...

437
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:37,350
...不知你能否抽空过来帮下我
...and I was hoping you couId come by and heIp me with that sometime.

438
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:39,594
行
Yeah.

439
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:41,559
行 没问题 谢谢
Yeah, sure. Good.

440
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:44,700
凯特和我说不定能帮上忙 告诉我们一声就行
Maybe Kate and I couId heIp you out. Just Iet us know.

441
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:46,459
那到时候叫你
I'II call you.

442
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:48,570
走吧 宝贝
Let's go, honey.

443
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:53,467
好的 我来看着你
MAN: Okay, I'm watching you.

444
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:11,240
布伦达爸爸说是你推的她
Brenda's father says that you pushed her.

445
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:12,904
不是的
That's not true.

446
00:44:13,082 --> 00:44:14,572
我们只是在玩
We were just pIaying.

447
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,911
我发誓
I swear.

448
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:20,518
好吧 你知道怎么回事吗?
Okay. And did you see what happened?

449
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:23,719
她滑倒了
[SIGNING]

450
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:57,488
什么? 妈妈 她说的什么?
What? Mom, what's she saying?

451
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,288
她要你把面包和黄油递给她
She wants you to pass the bread and butter.

452
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:04,893
又没问你 嘿 别吵架哈
Wasn't asking you. JOHN: Hey, now.

453
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,936
你就不能正常的吃饭吗?
Can you eat normaI?

454
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:19,604
正常人就像我这样吃饭
I am eating normaI.

455
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:22,774
估计只在你以前住的特兰西瓦尼亚 还是什么国家才算正常吧
Yeah, maybe in TransyIvania, or whatever country you're from.

456
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:24,977
那我顺便说一声 我来自俄罗斯
Incidentally, I'm from Russia.

457
00:45:25,154 --> 00:45:29,614
而且特兰西瓦尼亚不是个国家 早并入罗马尼亚了
TransyIvania isn't even a country. It's a part of Romania.

458
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:31,157
你真是个变态
You are such a freak.

459
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:33,192
嘿 嘿 丹尼
Hey. Hey, Danny.

460
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:35,193
不准再说这事了 明白吗?
I don't want any more taIk Iike that.

461
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:37,832
她非得那个样子吗?
But why does she have to act Iike that?

462
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,161
我朋友全都因为她而取笑我
AII my friends make fun of me because of her.

463
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:42,099
那也许你该换朋友了
Maybe you need different friends.

464
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,206
又也许你该把她送回孤儿院了
Maybe you shouId send her back to the retard camp.

465
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:47,001
丹尼尔 丹尼尔
DanieI. DanieI.

466
00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:48,700
向你姐姐道歉
ApoIogize to your sister.

467
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:52,609
她不是我"他妈的"姐姐
She's not my fucking sister.

468
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:56,581
我明白了
JOHN: I got it.

469
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,383
明白了
Okay.

470
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:03,983
让我来管
That's me.

471
00:46:22,044 --> 00:46:24,308
道完歉才还你钥匙
You get the key back when you say you're sorry.

472
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:33,712
今晚想吃点什么特别的吗?
Is there anything speciaI you want me to make tonight?

473
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:35,379
有没有什么特别爱吃的?
You have any favorites?

474
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:40,659
喂
HeIIo.

475
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,197
哈哈 你们好吗? 嗨 我们很开心 过的很好
WeII, how are you? Hi, we're great. We're doing good.

476
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:46,198
她怎么样? 她就在这的 等等
How is she? KATE: She's here, hold on.

477
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:49,099
嘿 是阿比盖尔修女 要打个招呼吗?
Hey, Sister AbigaiI. Do you wanna say heIIo?

478
00:46:49,271 --> 00:46:53,264
快点 艾斯特 随便打个招呼 我说了 不打
Come on. Esther, just quickIy say hi. I said, no.

479
00:46:56,912 --> 00:47:02,043
呃 宝贝 能帮我挑5个苹果吗?
You know what, do you mind, darIing, can you get five appIes for me?

480
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:05,381
对不起 她突然有点害羞
Sorry, she got shy all of a sudden.

481
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:07,954
没事的 我打来是想告诉你...
It's all right. I'm just calling to remind you...

482
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:10,387
我需要她的病理记录...
...that I'm gonna need her medicaI...

483
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,255
和护牙记录来完成我的监护报告
...and dentaI charts for my supervision report.

484
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,255
她在说啥?

485
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,967
她不怕看牙医
She's not thriIIed about the dentist.

486
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:21,967
在说你呢

487
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:26,030
你们相处得如何? 熟悉彼此了吗?
How is everyone doing? Is she opening up to you?

488
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:29,666
算是吧 几周前她还冲我吐脏话呢
I guess you can say that. She dropped the F bomb on me a few weeks ago.

489
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,541
什么是脏话?
[SIGNING]

490
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:34,410
可能她开始彻底放开了吧
I guess she's finally coming out of her sheII.

491
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:37,646
也许吧
Yeah.

492
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,583
她还有犯其他错误吗?
Any other gIitches I shouId know of?

493
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:41,279
最近出了个大事
We had a big one recently.

494
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:43,482
是关于她同学布伦达的
It's a girI named Brenda at schooI.

495
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:45,529
她们在说布伦达

496
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:49,229
她们在玩操场的滑梯 结果那姑娘摔下来了
They were at the pIayground, there was a sIide, weII, she feII off.

497
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:52,663
有人说是艾斯特推的
Esther may have pushed her down.

498
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:55,429
但我没亲眼看到 那姑娘受伤了
I'm not getting the story straight, but she got hurt.

499
00:47:55,604 --> 00:47:56,628
严重吗?
Is she all right?

500
00:47:56,806 --> 00:48:00,003
很幸运 伤了脚踝 其他地方还缝了六针
LuckiIy. She broke her ankIe and had something Iike six stitches.

501
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:01,801
那可不算幸运
That doesn't sound too Iucky.

502
00:48:01,977 --> 00:48:04,309
很幸运她没摔断脖子
WeII, she's Iucky she didn't break her neck.

503
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:36,705
你以前说你不会弹钢琴的
You toId me you didn't know how to pIay.

504
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:39,473
没 我没说过 有 你说过
No, I didn't. Yes, you did.

505
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:42,549
是你想教我 我跟着学而已
You offered to teach me and I accepted.

506
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:48,156
好吧 那你就一直假装不会弹吗?
Okay. So then you were just pretending this whoIe time?

507
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:50,292
我觉得你很想找个人教
I thought you wouId enjoy teaching me.

508
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:54,361
对你这样热爱音乐的人来说 一个不懂音乐的儿子...
It must be frustrating for someone who Ioves music as much as you...

509
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:58,364
和一个丧失听力的女儿 肯定让你沮丧至极
...to have a son who isn't interested and a daughter who can't even hear.

510
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:05,799
等下 等等
Wait, wait, wait.

511
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,838
我进屋的时候 她正熟练的弹着柴可夫斯基的曲子
I waIk in on her pIaying Tchaikovsky without a mistake.

512
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:13,311
那意味着她一直在骗我
I mean, she's been Iying to me this whoIe time.

513
00:49:13,482 --> 00:49:16,349
她只是想多和你相处吧 不算欺骗
JOHN: She just wants to spend time with you. It's hardIy a Iie.

514
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:17,543
你不了解
KATE: You wouIdn't know.

515
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,314
她在你面前一直都很乖
You wouIdn't. She's on her best behavior with you.

516
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:23,549
而在我面前却好似另外一个人
She's compIeteIy different with me.

517
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:25,489
那你有什么看法?
So, what are you saying?

518
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:28,027
不知道 她在教室里大声尖叫
I don't know. She threw a fit at schooI.

519
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:29,994
在操场上推布伦达
She pushed Brenda at the pIayground.

520
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:34,068
你是想说都是她的错? 不知道 亲爱的 不知道了
Now you're saying that was her fauIt? I don't know. Honey, I don't know.

521
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:36,534
我不在场 当时是你看着她的
I wasn't there. You were watching them.

522
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:40,266
噢 算了吧 那只是个意外
Oh, come on. It was an accident.

523
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:43,673
好吧 那我们不去责备她了
Okay, Iet's not bIame her for anything, fine.

524
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:45,507
我也去相信她说的每件事
I'II take her word for everything.

525
00:49:45,681 --> 00:49:48,775
也包括你和乔伊斯的事吗?
ShouId I just beIieve what she said about you and Joyce too?

526
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:50,885
她怎么说的?
What did she say?

527
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:55,622
她说你和她搞暧昧 什么?
She says that you were hitting on her. What?

528
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:59,420
噢 她肯定误会了 那只是...
Oh, come on. She must've misunderstood. It was, Iike....

529
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:00,926
她有叫你去她家吗?
Did she invite you over?

530
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:04,259
她让我去她家帮忙搬椅子
She asked me to heIp her move a chair.

531
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:08,460
她说过? 是的 但我婉拒了
She did? Yeah. I bIew her off.

532
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:11,037
噢 天啊
Oh, God.

533
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:12,401
为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you teII me?

534
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:14,406
因为... 我们本可一笑置之
I We couId've Iaughed about it.

535
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:16,374
不 我担心... 而你却瞒着我
No, I knew how You were hiding it.

536
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,945
我担心你会像现在这样
Honey, I knew how you'd react.

537
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:21,309
凯特 凯特
Kate. Kate.

538
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:24,316
你不能对我交谈的每个女生 都那么敏感
You can't get jeaIous of every woman that I taIk to, right?

539
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:26,818
八百年前的事儿了 你这话什么意思?
It's been Iike 1 0 years. What does that mean?

540
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,150
说得好像是我的错
You say that Iike it actually means something.

541
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:31,724
我是最近两年才知道那事的
It's onIy been two years since you toId me.

542
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:36,763
你知道我有多抱歉 而我现在觉得压根不信任我
You know how sorry I am. I just feeI Iike I've earned a IittIe trust here.

543
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:40,629
我也给过你机会 不公平 太不公平了
I gave you a second chance. That's not fair. That's not fair.

544
00:50:40,803 --> 00:50:44,000
说清楚点 是不是只能说我的错 而不准提你的?
Let me get this straight. We can taIk about my mistakes, not yours?

545
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:47,665
我那是病! 你这个想操别人的混蛋!
I was sick! You were an asshoIe who wanted to fuck somebody eIse!

546
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:50,175
你让我们的孩子命悬一线
You put our chiId's Iife in danger.

547
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:53,348
我几个月前就可以离开你 而且不会有人怪我
I couId've waIked away months ago. Nobody wouId've bIamed me.

548
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:57,975
噢 过分了 你过分了 是你妈妈教你这样说的?
Oh, that's sharp. That's sharp. Where did you get that from, your mother?

549
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,363
丹尼 别玩那垃圾了 我得做事
Danny. Turn that crap down, pIease, I gotta work.

550
00:51:15,537 --> 00:51:16,595
好吧 谢谢
Fine. Thank you.

551
00:51:21,477 --> 00:51:23,172
我去吧
ESTHER: I'II get it.

552
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:32,211
你好 艾斯特 你来这干嘛?
HeIIo, Esther. What are you doing here?

553
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,480
我能进去吗?
May I come in?

554
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:38,024
我可能搞错了一件事
I'm afraid I may have made a mistake.

555
00:51:38,193 --> 00:51:40,320
艾斯特好像有点问题
There couId be something wrong with Esther.

556
00:51:40,496 --> 00:51:41,690
什么?
What?

557
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:44,958
什么意思? 你说过她从来不惹麻烦
What? You toId us that you'd never had any troubIe with her.

558
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:48,399
是的 但麻烦总找上她
I didn't. But troubIe does have a way of finding her.

559
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,628
什么样的麻烦?
What kind of troubIe?

560
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,335
有一次两个女孩打架 她在场
Two girIs get into a fight, there she is.

561
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:56,171
有人偷东西被抓 她又在场
Someone gets caught steaIing, there she is again.

562
00:51:56,345 --> 00:51:58,540
那又怎样? 难道...? 先让她说完
So? Does that mean ? Just Iet her finish.

563
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:02,980
你告诉我滑梯事件后 我打去她以前的学校
After you toId me about the girI in the pIayground, I called her oId schooI.

564
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:05,586
得知有次一个男孩...
WhiIe she was there, there was a boy...

565
00:52:05,754 --> 00:52:07,722
手握剪刀摔了一跤...
...who feII with scissors in his hand...

566
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,518
不小心把手给扎了个大口子
...and accidentally stabbed himseIf through the jaw.

567
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:12,183
艾斯特同样在场
And Esther was there again.

568
00:52:12,361 --> 00:52:15,728
我不明白了 你都说了是不小心
I don't understand. He accidentally stabbed himseIf.

569
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:19,334
但最大的麻烦还是沙利文家房屋被烧
But the most troubIing thing is the SuIIivan house fire.

570
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:22,527
我深入了解了一下 那是纵火案
I checked into it further. It was arson.

571
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:25,938
犯人一直没找到
They have never found the person who did it.

572
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:28,099
你到底想说什么呢?
JOHN: What are you suggesting here?

573
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:30,609
这些事她都有份参与?
That she had anything to do with any of this?

574
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:32,076
太荒谬了
It's ridicuIous.

575
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:34,238
我也不愿相信这些事...
ABIGAIL: That a chiId couId commit such crimes...

576
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:36,281
会出自一个孩子之手
...it fIies in the face of everything I beIieve.

577
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:37,918
是啊 不会的
WeII, yeah.

578
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:47,428
家里来了个刻薄的女人 她想带我走
There's a mean Iady here. She's come to take me away.

579
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:49,564
你能帮帮我吗?
WiII you heIp me?

580
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:53,361
她有些行为是不好 但...
We've had some behavioraI probIems, but....

581
00:52:53,535 --> 00:52:56,197
但还不至于到那种地步 对吧?
Yeah, nothing Iike that. I mean, right?

582
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:59,068
有 有的 真的吗 再想想
Yes, we have. JOHN: Really, hon, think about it.

583
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:02,938
我有试过联系她在俄罗斯的孤儿院
ABIGAIL: I've tried to reach the Russian orphanage where she was raised.

584
00:53:03,112 --> 00:53:05,706
我觉得有必要搞清楚她的背景
I think we need to know what we're deaIing with.

585
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:08,372
好吧 我来告诉你
WeII, I'II teII you what we're deaIing with.

586
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,609
等一下 别说话 听着
KATE: No, you know what? Stop it. Listen.

587
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:13,949
她就只是一个九岁大的 父母双亡的小女孩
We're deaIing with a 9 year oId girI who's an orphan, okay?

588
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:18,150
我们得带她去见见布朗宁医生 那就带她去见见布朗宁医生
We're taking her to Dr. Browning. We can take her to Dr. Browning.

589
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:24,563
去找树屋的钥匙

591
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,122

592
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:29,856
好的 您保重 好的 非常感谢
JOHN: Right. Take care. KATE: Okay. Thank you very much.

593
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:31,693
晚点再玩
Maybe Iater.

594
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:53,678
不会有事的
It's going to be fine.

595
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:57,189
我们只是吓吓她好让她别再来了
We'II scare her so bad she'II never come back here.

596
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,525
她来了
Here she comes.

597
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:08,727
去招手让她停车
Wave your arms and make her stop.

598
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:10,132
麦克斯 去吧
Max, go.

599
00:55:39,768 --> 00:55:42,464
你没事吧? 麦克斯?
You all right? Max?

00:55:42,671 --> 00:55:44,400
麦克斯?
Max?

抓住脚 帮我把她弄到路边去
Grab a foot and heIp me get her off the road.

00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:03,870
就因为你帮我藏尸体 他们也会把你关进监狱
They'II send you to jaiI just for heIping me hide her.

609
00:58:04,046 --> 00:58:07,880

I had to kiII her because she was going to teII on me.

610
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:14,378
你不会告发我的 对吧?
You're not going to teII on me. Are you?

你在干嘛? 你看见些什么?
What are you doing? What did you see?

617
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:50,444
我看见你和麦克斯在树屋里
I saw you and Max in the tree house.

00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:52,018
其他呢?

听懂了吗? 懂了
Do you understand me? Yes.

你尿床了

We'II be right out, honey. You can come on in.

631
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:50,534
我的第一直觉是...
My initiaI instinct is that...

632
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:54,511
艾斯特的过去没什么 根深蒂固的大问题
...there's not a deepIy rooted probIem in Esther's past.

633
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:59,243
那她现在没问题? 也不是
So there's nothing wrong with her? No.

634
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:05,290
问题还是有 我们需要去关注一下...
It's not all good news. I think what needs to be examined...

635
01:01:05,493 --> 01:01:09,020
艾斯特和她周围人之间的关系
...is Esther's reIationship with those around her.

636
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:10,794
特别是和你 凯特
Specifically with you, Kate.

637
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:14,767
你们之间的关系似乎很紧张
It seems she feeIs there's been some reaI tension between the two of you.

638
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:18,101
是么 她已经尽力讨好你...
Okay. She's doing her best to pIease you...

639
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,708
你却不领情
...but you're bIocking her attempts to bond.

640
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:26,512
不是那样的 根本不是那么回事 该做的我都做了

641
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,379
是吧? 让她说完
Right? Just Iet her finish.

642
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:32,453
有些事导致她产生这样的感觉
Something's happening to cause Esther to feeI this way.

643
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:36,991
也许是你对酗酒或对麦克斯感到内疚
Perhaps it's your guiIt about drinking or what happened to Max.

644
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,856
也许是你自认不是个合格的母亲的情绪...
Maybe some of your feeIings of inadequacy as a mother...

645
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,362
在与艾斯特相处时不自觉的流露
...are manifesting themseIves in your reIationship with Esther.

646
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,694
我不认为我不合适啊
I don't feeI inadequate.

647
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,733
她跟你说了什么啊?
What did she tell you?

648
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,034
她没察觉 她没发现
She didn't see. She doesn't know.

649
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,304
她很白痴
She's so stupid.

650
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,143
艾斯特是个很害羞 缄默...
Esther's a very shy, reserved...

651
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:04,946
和敏感的小女孩 她正处于最困难的时期
...sensitive IittIe girI going through an extremeIy difficuIt time.

652
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:15,153
她特别的聪明 善于表达
She's exceptionally bright and highIy articuIate.

653
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,601
只需要多点耐心 多点理解
She just needs a IittIe patience and understanding.

654
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,715
多谢你的"支持"
Thanks for your support back there.

That was your idea.

凯特 等等
Kate, wait, wait, wait.

657
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:53,699
虽然我不是心理医师 但我觉得她说得有些道理
I'm not a psychiatrist, but a Iot of what she said made sense.

658
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,770
要接么?
Do you wanna get that?

她从昨天就一直没回来...
She hasn't returned since yesterday...

666

...this kind of thing. Who wouId do this? It's....

671
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,191
恐怖了
AwfuI.

672
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:01,667
如果你们有其它线索 电话我们
You think of anything eIse, you give us a call.

673
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,328
嗯 一定
KATE: Yes. AbsoIuteIy.

674
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,799
走了
Let's go.

675
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,528
这些正是阿比盖尔修女说的 看
This is what Sister AbigaiI was taIking about. Look.

676
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:09,399
"性格障碍儿童" 看这些症状
''Character disturbed chiIdren.'' Look at the symptoms.

677
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:14,669
"看起来可爱 难交朋友以及维系友谊"
''Superficially charming. DifficuIty at making and keeping friends.''

678
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,174
我觉得修女未必是这个意思
I'm not sure this is what she meant.

679
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:21,283
她可以拣布朗宁医生想听的说
She couId've toId Dr. Browning whatever she wanted to hear. Look.

680
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,945
"他们善于操纵...
They ''are adroit manipuIators...

681
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:29,955
常常挑拨他人敌对达到自己目的"
...oftentimes pIaying peopIe off one another to get what they want.''

682
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,389
你打算让布朗宁医生也看看?
Well, you gonna show this to Dr. Browning?

683
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:34,894
我不打算给她看这些
I'm not showing her anything.

684
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,092
我以后都不见她了
I'm not seeing her anymore.

685
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,235
你什么时候决定的? 你觉得呢?
When did you decide that? When do you think?

686
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:42,268
你不信任布朗宁医生了?
You're gonna discount Dr. Browning?

687
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:46,238
为什么你不怀疑其他人有问题 单单只怀疑我呢?
Why does everyone get the benefit of the doubt from you except for me?

688
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:59,245
如果需要帮手照顾孩子们 我们可以找一位
If you need heIp with the kids, we can arrange that.

689
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,686
我不需要
I don't need heIp.

690
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,497
只是想了解她多一点
I just wanna know more about her.

691
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,638
她从哪来 她是谁
I wanna know where she came from, and I wanna know who she is.

692
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,001
假如阿比盖尔修女是对的?
What if Sister AbigaiI was right?

693
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,972
如果有人身处危险 我们自己的孩子...
I mean, if someone was in danger, our own chiIdren...

694
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,841
难道你不想搞清楚? 我当然想
...wouIdn't you wanna know? Of course I wouId.

695
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:28,780
我会和她以前的俄罗斯孤儿院联系
I'll contact the orphanage she came from in Russia. All right?

696
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,475
这是初步打算
I mean, it's a start.

697
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,491
怎么了? 嘿
What? JOHN: Hey.

698
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,429
好吧
Fine.

699
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:54,940
我想知道你是否有收到来自 Sludyanka孤儿院的消息
I was wondering if you'd heard from anyone at the SIudyanka SheIter.

700
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,807
阿比盖尔修女曾提过 她要...
Sister AbigaiI had mentioned that she wouId

701
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,541
你查了
Oh, you did.

702
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,882
我不明白 为什么没有她在那的记录呢?
I don't understand. How can they have no record of her being there?

703
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:08,954
好的 谢谢
Yes, pIease.

704
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:13,255
如果你一有消息请马上电话我 谢谢
CouId you just call me as soon as you know anything, pIease? Thank you.

705
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,820
艾斯特 该走了
JOHN: Esther, we gotta go.

706
01:07:53,503 --> 01:07:55,198
艾斯特?
Esther?

707
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,937
艾斯特?
Esther?

708
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,709
被你吓到了
You got me.

709
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:09,414
怎么了? 我不想去看牙医
What? I don't want to go to the dentist.

710
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,213
为什么呢? 就是不想去
Why not? I just don't want to go.

711
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,618
害怕了? 不是
What, are you scared? No.

712
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,391
那就下次吧
We're gonna rescheduIe, though.

713
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:22,793
如果你乖乖的和我一起画画 你今天就可以翘课了
Tell you what, I'll Iet you pIay hooky if you want to come and draw with me.

714
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:24,899
好吧
All right.

715
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,266
等会 丹尼尔
KATE: Wait, DanieI.

716
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,897
你们和艾斯特处得如何?
How are you two getting aIong with Esther?

717
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,572
还不错
Fine, I guess.

718
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:39,078
是么? 嗯 妈妈
KATE: Yeah? DANIEL: Yeah, Mom.

719
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:45,411
她有没有让你们感到不安...
But has she ever made you feeI, I don't know, uncomfortabIe...

720
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:48,580
...或者有没有做什么不该做的事?
...or has she done anything that she's not supposed to do?

721
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:53,722
没有 比如 有没有伤害过你们?
No. Like, has she ever hurt any of you?

722
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,456
没有
DANIEL: No.

723
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,401
确定?
You sure?

724
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,968
好吧
Okay. All right.

725
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:12,173
只有我们俩真好
ESTHER: I Iike it when it's just the two of us.

726
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:16,442
你都想不到我等了多久才等到 像你这样的父亲
You don't know how Iong I've waited for a daddy just Iike you.

727
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,086
还有母亲 对不?
Mommy too, right?

728
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,954
我觉得妈妈不太喜欢我
I don't think Mommy Iikes me very much.

729
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:26,253
错了 妈妈爱你的 没什么的
That is not true. Mommy Ioves you. It's all right.

730
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:29,523
爱领养孩子当然不可能像 爱自己孩子一样多
It must be hard to Iove an adopted chiId as much as your own.

731
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:34,159
宝贝 你同丹尼和麦克斯一样 都是这个家的一部分 明白么?
Sweetheart, you're just as much a part of this famiIy as Danny and Max. Okay?

732
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,502
为妈妈做点什么 让她知道你爱她
Do something nice for Mommy. Show her how much you Iove her.

733
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,199
真是个好主意
That's a wonderfuI idea.

734
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,991
我有个惊喜要送给你 妈妈
I have a speciaI surprise for you, Mommy.

735
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,365
真的?
You do?

736
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:09,733
我为你摘了这些花
I picked these fIowers just for you.

737
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:18,669
艾斯特 你做了什么呀? 天哪 我的胳膊!
Esther, what did you do? God. ESTHER: My arm!

738
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:20,213
你为什么要这样做? 爸爸 我的胳膊!
KATE: Why did you do this? Daddy, my arm!

739
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,077
约翰! 嘿
KATE: John! Hey.

740
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:26,244
为什么要这样做? 嘿 停手 停手
KATE: What did you do? JOHN: Hey. Stop, stop.

741
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,513
为什么要这样做?
Why did you do this?

742
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,750
天呐 她故意的 不是
Oh, God. God, she did this on purpose. No, no, no.

743
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,393
就是的 亲爱的 不是
Yes, she did. Hey. Honey, no.

744
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,995
她明明清楚这些玫瑰对我意味着什么
She knew what these roses meant to me.

745
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:38,497
我的错 亲爱的 不该让她讨好你
It's my fauIt, hon. I toId her to do something nice for you.

746
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:40,363
真不敢相信
I can't beIieve this.

747
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,835
爸爸!
ESTHER: Daddy!

748
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,838
爸爸!
Daddy!

749
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:31,469
爸爸 爸爸!
Daddy, Daddy!

750
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:32,705
怎么了 宝贝?
What is it, honey?

751
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,510
我的手好痛啊
My arm still hurts.

752
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,892
看看好吗? 你会没事的
Can I have a Iook at it? You're okay.

753
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,527
我会轻轻的 没事的 宝贝
I'll be gentIe. It's all right, honey.

754
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,458
天呀
Oh, my God.

755
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,823
得马上送你去医院
We need to take you to the hospitaI.

756
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,840
你是个非常勇敢的女孩 知道么?
JOHN: You're a brave IittIe girI, you know that?

757
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:02,807
医生说你很快就能痊愈了
Doctor said you're gonna heaI reaI fast, okay?

758
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,522
你拉断了她的胳膊
You broke her arm.

759
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,760
不可能 我根本没用力拉她
KATE: It's impossibIe. I didn't grab her that hard.

760
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:32,033
她今晚想睡这 也许你该谁楼下去
She wants to sIeep in here tonight. Maybe you shouId sIeep downstairs.

761
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:54,395
今晚来客人了
I'm having guests for dinner.

762
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,230
不用找了 谢谢
You know, you can have it. Thanks.

763
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,863
过得开心
KATE: Have a good day.

764
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:16,369
丹尼尔
DanieI.

765
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,274
你的书
Your books.

766
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:25,049
怎么回事? 让我看看你的书包 我也不知道
What happened? Let me see your bag. I don't know.

767
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:30,815
才买的啊 把书捡起来 要不都湿了
We just bought this. Pick it up, it's gonna get wet.

768
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,060
妈妈!
Mom!

769
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,501
麦克斯! 不! 救命!
KATE: Max! No! HeIp!

770
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,805
麦克斯!
Max!

771
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,136
麦克斯!
Max!

772
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,050
麦克斯!
Max!

773
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,433
麦克斯!
Max!

774
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:16,366
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

775
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,905
我在这 妈妈在这 没事了 宝贝
I'm here. Mommy's here. You're okay, honey. Come on.

776
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:25,035
抱着你了 宝贝 没事了 对不起
I got you. Yeah. Oh, baby, it's okay. I'm so sorry.

777
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,573
我明明挂在停车档 还拉了手闸
I remember I put it in park and I set the brake.

778
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,448
麦克斯没说艾斯特做了什么
Max didn't indicate that Esther did anything.

779
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:37,718
麦克斯在 包庇她 而且不止这一次
Well, Max is covering for her. And I don't think it's the first time.

780
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:41,420
这也不是第一次你把自己犯的错 推到艾斯特头上
It aIso wouIdn't be the first time you bIamed Esther for your own mistake.

781
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,435
我不希望她继续待在这里
You know what? I want her out of this house.

782
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,867
你打算让人把她领走了?
You're ready for somebody to come and take her?

783
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:52,473
是的 我不在乎
I am. I don't care.

784
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:56,475
我会不惜一切代价保护我的孩子
I will do whatever it takes to protect my chiIdren.

785
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,340
女孩们早上发现了这个
The girIs found this this morning.

786
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,977
女孩们发现 你是说艾斯特发现的吧
The girIs found it. You mean Esther found it.

787
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,779
是艾斯特 有区别么? 她说谎了?
Yes, Esther. Does it make any difference? Is she Iying?

788
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,079
你需要帮助
BROWNING: You need heIp.

789
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:09,281
我们在康复中心为你做了预定...
We've reserved a pIace for you in a rehabiIitation faciIity...

790
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,790
离这仅45分钟路程
...about 45 minutes from here.

791
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,325
我没喝
KATE: I didn't drink it.

792
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:16,931
买了两瓶 往水池子里倒了一瓶
I bought two bottIes. I poured one of them down the sink.

793
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,828
不是这个? 不是
But not this one? No.

794
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:22,801
约翰 我快一年滴酒未沾了
John, I haven't had a drink in aImost a year.

795
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,439
我们是想帮你 如果你还在欺骗自己...
We wanna heIp you, but there's nothing we can do...

796
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:29,668
我们就没办法了 我没说谎 我是想喝
...untiI you stop Iying to yourseIf. KATE: I'm not Iying. I wanted to drink it.

797
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:33,439
你都不知道我他妈的多想喝 但我没喝
You have no fucking idea how badIy I wanted to drink it, but I didn't.

798
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,981
我没喝 假如麦克斯受伤了....
I didn't drink it. If Max had gotten hurt....

799
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:39,746
今天早上的事跟这个没有一点关系
What happened this morning has nothing to do with this.

800
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:41,514
没法信你
I find that hard to beIieve.

801
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:46,455
我滴酒不沾的唯一原因就是为了麦克斯和丹尼尔
The onIy reason that I'm sober is because of Max and DanieI.

802
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:51,090
一想到你若因我酗酒而离开 且酿成大祸...
I think about what wouId have happened had you not been there...

803
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:53,291
我会杀了我自己的
...and it makes me wanna kill myseIf.

804
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:55,198
我不会做任何事...
I wouId never do anything...

805
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:58,464
让这种情况发生 不会
...to Iet something Iike that ever happen again. I wouIdn't.

806
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,938
太煽情了
That is so manipuIative.

807
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:04,477
我知道没有理由让你相信我
I know I haven't given you reason to beIieve me, I know I haven't.

808
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,978
我对你说谎了 我该告诉你的
I Iied to you. I shouId have toId you about this.

809
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:10,482
我会接受治疗 我会去该死的戒酒互助会 如果这是你希望的...
I'll go to therapy, I'll go to fucking A.A. if that's what you want...

810
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:13,018
但你一定要相信我 我不信
...but you have to beIieve me. I don't.

811
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,021
你必须相信我 约翰 这事你必须信我
You have to beIieve me. John, you have to trust me on this.

812
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,625
你有一周的时间考虑是去康复中心...
I'll give you a week to go to rehab...

813
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:21,319
还是我带孩子们走
...or I'm Ieaving and I'm taking the kids with me.

814
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:23,692
这样很公平 是吧?
I think that's fair, okay?

815
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:26,391
我会尽力帮你 让你尽快恢复
I'll heIp you as much as I can, make it really easy.

816
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,365
妈妈下午会过来
Mom's gonna come in the afternoon.

817
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:33,497
好吗? 我很愿意 愿意帮你度过难关
All right? I'm willing to do this. I'm willing to try and figure this out.

818
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:37,475
都看你了 如果你敢讲出去我就枪毙了你妈妈
But it's up to you. I'll shoot Mommy if you tell.

819
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,096
麦克斯 麦克斯 你没事吧?
Max. Max, are you okay?

820
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:05,763
她做了什么? 是她动了手脚导致车祸的?
What did she do? Did she do something to make the car crash?

821
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:11,879
你看见了 就要帮我 这样爸妈才可以保护我们
If you saw her, you have to heIp me, so Mom and Dad can protect us.

822
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,837
他们无能为力的
[SIGNING]

823
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,077
为什么?
Why not?

824
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,353
这是阿比盖尔修女?
Is that Sister AbigaiI?

825
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:37,404
麦克斯 她在我树屋里干嘛?
Max. What did she do in my tree house?

826
01:19:38,303 --> 01:19:40,104
她把不好的东西放进去了

827
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,937
那些不好的东西还在么?
Are the bad things still there?

828
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,248
一切都会没事的
Everything's gonna be okay.

829
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:52,149
我会把那些东西从树屋取出来 这样他们就会信我们了
I'll get the stuff from the tree house. Then they'll have to beIieve us.

830
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,532
要去哪啊 凯特? 你在这做什么?
Going somewhere, Kate? What are you doing here?

831
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,195
她很好 别吵醒她
She's fine. Let's not wake her.

832
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:46,534
回你自己房间去
Go to your room.

833
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:50,269
不用再假扮了 对么?
HonestIy, we're past that now. Aren't we?

834
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,504
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're doing.

835
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,547
我不会让你伤害我孩子一丝一毫的
I will not Iet you hurt my chiIdren.

836
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:56,945
我?
Me?

837
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,714
我又不是那个喝得醉醺醺的 害麦克斯在池塘溺水的人
I'm not the one who passed out drunk and Iet Max aImost drown in the pond.

838
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,322
要不是约翰...
If it wasn't for John...

839
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:06,291
她就死了 而你也该在牢里待着了
...she'd be dead, and you'd probabIy still be in jaiI.

840
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,322
谁告诉你的?
Who toId you that?

841
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,228
非常隐私
It's very intimate.

842
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:15,830
让我了解了很多 还给我
I Iearned so much. Give it to me.

843
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:19,531
杰西卡 还有背叛你的丈夫 艾斯特 还给我
Jessica. Your cheating husband. Esther, give it to me.

844
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,505
酒瓶藏在哪了
Where you hide your wine bottIes.

845
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:24,009
我... 我警告你
I'm I'm warning you right now.

846
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,511
"医生宣布噩耗时 她还在踢我...
''She was still kicking when the doctor toId me...

847
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:29,378
而那只是幻觉...
...it was something called phantom...

848
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,018
胎动的幻觉
...fetaI movement.

849
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:34,849
16天来 我怀着已经夭折的孩子'' 住嘴 艾斯特
For 1 6 days, I carried my dead baby.'' Stop it. Esther.

850
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,254
''是我能想象到的最残忍的折磨''
''It was the crueIest torture I couId imagine.''

851
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:40,861
闭嘴 你给我闭嘴
Stop it. You stop it.

852
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,156
你到底怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

853
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:46,096
凯特 太晚了 都是你的错
Kate, it's too Iate. It's your own fauIt.

854
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:47,929
你把这个家庭当成 理所当然的
You took your famiIy for granted.

855
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:51,665
你什么意思? 你想干吗?
What do you mean? What are you going to do?

856
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:55,037
打我?
Hit me?

857
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:03,842
我们是从你们那领养的 你居然说你们完全不了解她?
We adopted her from you. How couId you not know anything?

858
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,283
沙利文有可能是非法收养她
The Sullivans couId have adopted her illegally.

859
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:09,424
她记不起任何对我们有帮助的事情了?
She doesn't remember anything that could help us?

860
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:12,783
我会再打的
I'm gonna call you back.

861
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:31,377
''Saarne机构''
''Saarne Institute.''

862
01:23:31,427 --> 01:23:32,689
谢谢

863
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:55,994
你好 你会说英语吗?
Hello. Do you speak EngIish?

864
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,527
你会说英语吗?
Do you speak EngIish?

865
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,692
不好意思 有没有人会说英语?
Is there anyone who speaks EngIish there?

866
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,838
事情紧急
This is very important.

867
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,274
不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're saying.

868
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:24,922
喂? 是Saarne机构吗?
Hello? Is this the Saarne Institute?

869
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:26,650
是的
Yes.

870
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:30,263
我想询问你们机构一个孩子的情况
Yes. I need to taIk to somebody about one of your chiIdren.

871
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:33,059
她被一户美国家庭所收养 是女孩
She was adopted by an American famiIy. It's a girI.

872
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:36,362
她不可能是这儿的
She is not come from here.

873
01:24:36,537 --> 01:24:38,664
我还没说她的名字呢
Well, I haven't even toId you her name yet.

874
01:24:38,839 --> 01:24:41,706
你不明白 Saarne机构不是孤儿院
You do not understand. Saarne Institute is not an orphanage.

875
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,241
而是精神病院
It is a mentaI hospitaI.

876
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,240
你是在找这个吗?
Are you Iooking for this?

877
01:25:15,442 --> 01:25:16,841
可怜的阿比盖尔修女
Poor Sister AbigaiI.

878
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:22,812
这种事儿我一个人可做不来 麦克斯和我一样有罪
I couIdn't have done it myseIf, you know. Max is just as guiIty as I am.

879
01:25:22,983 --> 01:25:26,646
不管麦克斯做了什么 都是你逼她的 想想看
Whatever Max did, you made her do it. Think about it.

880
01:25:26,854 --> 01:25:29,345
她怎么可能知道东西藏在这里?
How did she even know what was up here?

881
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:33,120
证据还是烧了好
It's aIways better to burn the evidence.

882
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:38,163
如果被找到 他们不仅会追究我
If they find these things, they won't just be coming for me.

883
01:25:38,365 --> 01:25:40,094
也会追究麦克斯
They'll be coming for Max too.

884
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,469
你真想这样? 等等
Is that really what you want? Wait.

885
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:46,603
你做什么啊?
What are you doing?

886
01:25:47,808 --> 01:25:49,400
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

887
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,414
放我出去!
Let me out!

888
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:59,416
放我出去!
Let me out of here!

889
01:26:09,763 --> 01:26:12,755
妈妈!
Mom!

890
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:18,295
是Saarne机构 S A A R N E Saarne
It's called the Saarne Institute. S A A R N E, Saarne.

891
01:26:18,472 --> 01:26:19,700
在爱沙尼亚
It's in Estonia.

892
01:26:19,907 --> 01:26:24,469
爱沙尼亚? 不可能 她的资料都来自于俄国
Estonia? No, this can't be right. All of her paperwork is from Russia.

893
01:26:24,645 --> 01:26:27,045
我正给他们传照片
I'm sending them a picture of her right now.

894
01:26:27,214 --> 01:26:29,978
或许她的生母是那儿的病人
Maybe her birth mother was a patient there.

895
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:32,710
或许她还出生在那儿
I don't know. Maybe she was even born there.

896
01:26:38,058 --> 01:26:40,117
妈妈!
Mom!

897
01:26:40,928 --> 01:26:43,795
救命!
HeIp!

898
01:26:59,947 --> 01:27:02,177
妈妈! 爸爸!
Mom! Dad!

899
01:27:09,556 --> 01:27:11,046
天哪!
Oh, God!

900
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:22,495
天哪 打911!
Oh, God. Call 91 1 !

901
01:27:34,381 --> 01:27:36,906
别担心 你要上天堂了
Don't worry. You're going to heaven.

902
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,383
天哪!
KATE: Oh, God!

903
01:27:43,724 --> 01:27:48,184
天哪! 丹尼尔!
Oh, my God! DanieI!

904
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:51,230
快走开! 别靠近大火!
Move away! Move away from the fire!

905
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:52,456
丹尼尔?
DanieI?

906
01:27:52,633 --> 01:27:56,933
上帝啊 丹尼尔? 妈妈来了 你能听见吗?
Oh, God, no. DanieI? Mommy's right here. Can you hear me?

907
01:27:57,104 --> 01:28:00,096
快醒醒 亲爱的 妈妈就在这儿
PIease wake up. Honey, Mommy's right here, okay?

908
01:28:00,274 --> 01:28:02,504
你会没事的
You're gonna be all right.

909
01:28:12,886 --> 01:28:17,152
腹部出血已止住 但他颈部受伤严重
We stopped the abdominaI bIeeding, but he has a very serious neck injury.

910
01:28:17,324 --> 01:28:21,385
目前情况稳定 你们很幸运
He's stabiIized for now. You shouId consider yourseIves very Iucky.

911
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:23,928
我们能见见他吗? 再过会儿
Can we see him? DOCTOR: In a IittIe whiIe.

912
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,066
他正在重症监护室
He's resting in the ICU.

913
01:28:26,233 --> 01:28:29,669
他能告诉我们事情经过吗?
Okay. And will he be abIe to tell us what happened?

914
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,395
有可能
DOCTOR: It's possibIe.

915
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:34,666
要等他醒来才能知道他是否 记得发生的事情
No way of knowing for sure what he'll remember untiI he wakes up.

916
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:37,034
失陪
Excuse me.

917
01:28:39,813 --> 01:28:41,644
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

918
01:28:45,419 --> 01:28:49,515
我知道你心力交瘁 我也是
JOHN: I know you're exhausted and upset, and so am I.

919
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:53,490
肯定有其他什么解释 她不会来自精神病院
There has to be some other expIanation. She didn't come from an insane asyIum.

920
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:57,994
你所认为的孤儿院对她一无所知
The orphanage you thought she came from has never heard of her.

921
01:28:58,165 --> 01:28:59,928
她的一切可能就是个谎言
Everything about her couId be a Iie.

922
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,092
一切 我们有她的护照 出生证明 学校档案
We have her passport. We have schooI records, medicaI records.

923
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:05,363
医疗档案 她来自于半个地球以外的国家
These are papers from around the worId.

924
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:07,597
这是什么? 就是一张纸
What is this? It's a piece of paper.

925
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:12,007
这次你妈也在场 不是我胡乱猜测
Your own mother was there this time. It wasn't just me. Your mother was there.

926
01:29:12,646 --> 01:29:15,547
纵火的要么是艾斯特要么是丹尼尔
It's either Esther or DanieI who started the fire.

927
01:29:15,716 --> 01:29:18,480
你认为是谁? 我不知道
Who do you think it was? I don't know.

928
01:29:18,652 --> 01:29:21,314
我受够了 不会再帮你串接这些疑点
I'm so done. I'm done connecting these dots for you.

929
01:29:21,488 --> 01:29:23,956
你爱怎么想我怎么想
You know, you can think whatever you want about me.

930
01:29:24,124 --> 01:29:27,457
如果你想 我今晚就可以离开
