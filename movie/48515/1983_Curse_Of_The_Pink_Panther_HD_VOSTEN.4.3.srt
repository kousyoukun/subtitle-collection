1
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,961
- How much?
- Six million.

2
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:41,362
- But that's ridiculous.
- It's worth 30.

3
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:44,122
It'll have to be split up.
We'll lose at least 40% of it.

4
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,605
Enough!

5
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,605
What?

6
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:47,922
I am Clouseau,

7
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,879
and justice will be done
in the name of the "lew."

8
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,591
One year ago today,
Inspector Jacques Clouseau,

9
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,795
the Police Academy's most
illustrious graduate, disappeared.

10
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:12,036
We felt it appropriate to broadcast
this commemorative program

11
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:15,471
from the Academy, where
a new generation of police officers

12
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,635
are about to receive their shields.

13
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:20,199
The question
on every Frenchman's mind is,

14
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:23,993
"What has happened to
France's greatest detective?

15
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,353
"Why haven't the authorities
been able to solve the mystery?"

16
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:30,593
Tell the police commissioner
I want to see him.

17
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,113
Oui, Monsieur Président.

18
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,913
The president himself gave the order!

19
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:40,874
And at 3:00 this morning,
the commissioner woke me up

20
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,758
to say he was putting me in charge. Me!

21
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:48,403
And I've got one month
to make Operation Paragon a success.

22
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:50,558
Otherwise, I'll be back on the vice squad

23
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:53,559
staking out pissoirs
for what is left of my career.

24
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:54,803
Operation Paragon?

25
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:57,123
Yes. The President's idea.

26
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:59,715
If France's greatest detective is missing,

27
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:02,240
then get the world's greatest detective
to find him.

28
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:04,684
And how do you find
the world's greatest detective?

29
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:07,680
By computer. The Commissioner's idea.

30
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:09,920
Interpol has computer files

31
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,561
on every law enforcement agency
in the world,

32
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:16,882
and I am supposed to program
the computer to select Clouseau's clone.

33
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,245
But Clouseau...

34
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,837
You know he was an idiot,
and I know he was an idiot,

35
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:24,125
but the rest of the world sees him
as a fearless deductive genius,

36
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,442
another Sherlock Holmes,

37
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,286
and that's the type of man
we are now looking for.

38
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:28,526
Then you have a problem.

39
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,959
Yes, because a man like this
might find Clouseau...

40
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,719
A horrible thought.

41
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:36,523
What's the alternative?

42
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,560
I don't know.

43
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,921
I'm damned if I do,
and I'm damned if I don't.

44
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,849
A series 600 Huxley computer.

45
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:04,047
You can program it by
voice command, you know.

46
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:06,686
Ouais. Observe this. Activate.

47
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,283
- Aldous.
- Ready, Dave.

48
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,768
Aldous can even recognize people's voices.

49
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,764
- Amazing.
- Elementary.

50
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:21,051
Chief Inspector Dreyfus, Sûreté,
vital statistics, please.

51
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,691
Coming up, Dave.

52
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:28,208
- What's the delay?
- Lots of material.

53
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,006
Well, just give me
an abbreviated version then.

54
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:34,370
All right. Charles Larousse Dreyfus.

55
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:38,526
Born Marseilles, April 1, 19...

56
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,493
Skip that. Skip that.

57
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:43,327
What is the subject's present occupation?

58
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,567
Subject's present occupation...

59
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:48,931
Chief Inspector, Criminal Division, Sûreté.

60
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:51,170
How's his health?

61
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:54,128
Last complete physical examination...

62
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:56,771
January 7th, this year.

63
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:58,768
Chronic hypertension.

64
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:02,611
May, 1978, suffered nervous breakdown

65
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,292
and was committed to the state mental...

66
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:05,972
- Skip!
- Sorry.

67
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,336
Do you want to ask him anything?

68
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,372
Yes.

69
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,490
What are the odds

70
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:17,250
that the greatest detective in the world
will find Clouseau?

71
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,534
Even money. Take your pick.

72
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,611
Well, aren't you being slightly optimistic?

73
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,131
Not at all.

74
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:29,255
Why? Are you afraid
he'll drive you crazy again?

75
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,131
Cool it, Aldous.

76
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:34,375
Just responding with
an obvious observation.

77
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:38,053
I hope I didn't offend you,
Inspector Dreyfus.

78
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:39,452
Not at all.

79
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:42,860
By the way, it's Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

80
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:45,816
Shame on you, Aldous.

81
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,620
Nobody's perfect. Have a happy day.

82
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:51,173
Yes?

83
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,461
Prisoner Steiger has arrived.

84
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:55,896
Show him in.

85
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,097
Come in.

86
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,694
Wait outside.

87
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,778
Sit down.

88
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:15,340
Maurice Steiger...
15 years for bank robbery.

89
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:18,259
How much was it?

90
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:21,897
About 150 million,
give or take a few francs.

91
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,536
And it's never been recovered.

92
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,301
It must be hell, sitting in prison,

93
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:34,585
dreaming about what
you could do with all that money.

94
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,785
It's not so bad.

95
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:40,023
I'm a model prisoner.
I come up for parole in six months.

96
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:44,582
Yes, but there's always the chance
that the Parole Board will turn you down.

97
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:46,818
I see.

98
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,099
I tell you where the money is,

99
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:51,263
you put in a good word
with the Parole Board.

100
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:52,859
No.

101
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,227
Listen...

102
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:58,824
It took a computer genius to embezzle

103
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,108
150 million francs from the Bank of France,

104
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,061
and I have a problem

105
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:07,301
that requires a computer genius.

106
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,701
You help me solve that problem,

107
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,061
and in 6 months' time, you'll be a free man,

108
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:14,950
living out 150 million dreams,

109
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,746
give or take a few dreams.

110
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,022
What's your problem?

111
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:22,910
Can you rig a computer

112
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,103
so that no matter what I program into it,

113
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:29,390
it will select the exact opposite?

114
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:31,230
Black is white? Day is night?

115
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:32,591
Exactly.

116
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:34,950
What sort of computer?

117
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,344
A Huxley 600.

118
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,628
There is only one of those in this country.

119
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:45,585
How are you going to get me into Interpol?

120
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:46,985
I can't.

121
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:49,225
Then how do you expect me to rig it?

122
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,546
I don't. I expect you to tell me how to rig it.

123
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:06,194
The President has just arrived,

124
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,831
and is being greeted by
Sergeant Duval of the Sûreté

125
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:11,111
and Secretary General Dulong of Interpol.

126
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,834
And now we switch to Michelle Chauvin,

127
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,308
who is about to interview
the star of these proceedings.

128
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:16,588
Good morning, Michelle.

129
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:20,076
This is Chief Inspector Dreyfus
of the Sûreté.

130
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:22,189
You are the one who is
going to program Aldous

131
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:23,828
to select Clouseau's successor?

132
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:24,868
Yes.

133
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,669
No.

134
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,510
He is not going to be Clouseau's successor.

135
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,269
Why not a she?

136
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,550
What?

137
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,713
Well, couldn't it just as easily be a woman,

138
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,431
or are you purposely
programming it to be a man?

139
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,471
No, no. We are just trying to find
the best, the most qualified...

140
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,558
The most like Clouseau?

141
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,590
Yes.

142
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:49,235
To paraphrase an old saying,

143
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:52,115
set a great detective
to find a great detective.

144
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:56,393
Exactly. But he or she
will not be Clouseau's successor.

145
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:59,517
I mean, they won't be
going to work for the Sûreté...

146
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:00,835
I hope.

147
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,200
Excuse me.

148
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,880
The President has just arrived.

149
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:07,641
In a few moments, Aldous the computer

150
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,033
will select from the files

151
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:11,754
of all the law enforcement
agencies in the world

152
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:13,677
the one man or woman

153
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:16,001
most qualified to solve the disappearance

154
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:17,437
of France's greatest detective.

155
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,238
And screw up my entire life.

156
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:20,482
Just over a year ago,

157
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:22,114
while investigating yet another theft

158
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:24,322
of the famous diamond, the Pink Panther,

159
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:27,318
Inspector Clouseau seemed to
vanish from the face of the earth,

160
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:30,559
leaving behind one of France's
greatest unsolved mysteries.

161
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,916
Not to mention
the 4,000 francs he owes me.

162
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,084
And now, working on the theory
that the best person to find Clouseau

163
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,644
is someone almost exactly like Clouseau,

164
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:42,317
Chief Inspector Dreyfus
will program Aldous the computer

165
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,917
with a character profile
of Inspector Clouseau.

166
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:47,681
That's going to put a hell of a strain
on poor old Aldous.

167
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,644
Obviously, Mr. President,

168
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:52,238
so as not to limit our choice,

169
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:56,159
I will omit sex, height, weight,

170
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:58,366
race, and nationality.

171
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,526
- Ready, Aldous?
- Ready, Charles.

172
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:08,923
Age... 61.

173
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,763
Senior officer.

174
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,487
I.Q...

175
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:22,408
Genius.

176
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,562
Specialities...

177
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:32,169
Judo, kung fu, Okinawan weaponry,

178
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,808
karate expert...

179
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:39,565
Black belt.

180
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:47,251
Expert ma... Ma...

181
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:49,890
Marksman.

182
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,683
Fearless.

183
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,084
Courageous.

184
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,528
A born leader.

185
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,088
Sir.

186
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:05,292
Is that it, Chief?

187
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:08,406
Select.

188
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:10,253
Coming right up.

189
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:20,207
What is he humming?

190
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:23,210
It sounds like Moon River...

191
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:24,695
Backwards!

192
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:29,687
Chief Inspector Dreyfus
is obviously nervous.

193
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,534
The President and the Commissioner

194
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,855
are waiting tensely
as the moment draws near.

195
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:35,575
Ladies and gentlemen,

196
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:37,895
after thoroughly searching the records

197
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:43,097
of 13,623,055 candidates,

198
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:46,570
I have come up with your man.

199
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,892
It's a man.

200
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,453
From the 11th Precinct

201
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,929
of the New York City Police Department,

202
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,294
I give you... A little drum roll, please...

203
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:06,899
Got a light, big boy?

204
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:11,859
Cliff, broads don't call
guys "big boy" anymore.

205
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:15,735
Right, Charlie.

206
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:19,500
I thought you didn't smoke.

207
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:22,060
I think it kinda goes with the look.

208
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,300
Thanks.

209
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:33,497
I don't believe it!
He's gonna blow their cover!

210
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:37,098
That's a nasty cough you got there, lady.

211
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:39,622
You shouldn't oughtta be smoking.

212
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:40,938
I lost a contact lens.

213
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,018
What?

214
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,415
I lost a lens.

215
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:46,535
I'll look for it later.
Can we just do with one?

216
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,776
I can't see without it,
and it cost me 85 bucks!

217
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,623
I'll lend you the money, for God's sake.

218
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:52,179
Oh, my... I found it.

219
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,016
Get it. Come on, let's go.

220
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:06,377
Well...

221
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,265
See you later.

222
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:23,299
He's gonna blow it.

223
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,099
He's gonna blow it.

224
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,347
Stay with him.

225
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:27,947
Don't forget the guys we're after

226
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,180
put a little old lady in the hospital.

227
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,704
I can't believe the lieutenant
would let a screw-up like Sleigh

228
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,187
work this kind of stakeout.

229
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,464
The lieutenant's been
under a lot of pressure lately.

230
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,461
Yeah? What kind of pressure?

231
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,620
Sleigh.

232
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:41,784
He's been driving the lieutenant bananas.

233
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,385
Maybe he hopes Sleigh will
end up like the little old lady.

234
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:46,705
Come on.

235
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,262
To tell you the truth, that thought
has passed through my mind.

236
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:56,343
Stop! Stop! Back up, back up, back up!

237
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:03,543
Stop! Stop! Go forward. Go forward.

238
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:06,026
Now, stop!

239
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,151
Hi there, beautiful.

240
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:12,431
Pardon me, I...

241
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:15,632
I feel that I know you.

242
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:17,471
Are you by any chance...

243
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:21,785
Sheila Swanhill from Petoskey, Michigan?

244
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,025
Well, if not...

245
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:28,429
Are you her sister,

246
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:31,386
or in any way related
to the Swanhill family?

247
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:35,470
Obviously not. If you were,
you would have recognized me by now.

248
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:39,387
Allow me to introduce myself.
Harley Hamilcar Ill.

249
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,870
I'm in cement.

250
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:47,628
Did you know that Petoskey
is the cement capital of the world?

251
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,427
Some drunk's trying to pick him up.

252
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:55,832
She had a cousin named...

253
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,592
Lindtrude.

254
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,989
My name's Derina.

255
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,350
Derina!

256
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,557
You have a lovely voice.

257
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,554
You do

258
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,834
Something to me

259
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,351
Something that

260
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,431
Simply mystifies me

261
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,475
Tell me

262
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:25,515
Why should it be

263
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:28,952
You have the power to hypnotize me?

264
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:32,275
It's getting out of hand.

265
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:34,076
...live 'neath your spell

266
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:37,633
Do do that voodoo that you do so well

267
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:40,120
What are you doing to me?

268
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:42,680
A real hooker's just joined the party.

269
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:46,837
What's all this dancing around?

270
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:57,799
I'm going in.

271
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:19,364
Not only did you screw up the stakeout,

272
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,640
but another little old lady was mugged.

273
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,125
To make matters worse,

274
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:25,477
we're the laughing stock
of the whole 28th Precinct,

275
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:28,122
and by the time those crumbs
get through spreading it around town,

276
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:29,244
we'll be the laughing stock

277
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:31,238
of the whole goddamn
New York City police force!

278
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:33,566
- With all due respect...
- What respect?

279
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:36,606
What do you know about respect?
You sure as hell don't respect me!

280
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,359
Oh, yes, I do.

281
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,447
I got an ulcer, I'm losing my hair,

282
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,680
and you're driving me
straight to the funny farm!

283
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,603
You call that respect?

284
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:47,647
What happened tonight
was not entirely my fault.

285
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,287
Three years on the police force,

286
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,520
you don't know
how to handle a common drunk?

287
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,964
You had to be there.

288
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,524
Sleigh...

289
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:01,405
If it wasn't for the fact...

290
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:05,450
That you're
a third-generation police officer,

291
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:08,085
and that your father
was not only my captain

292
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:09,809
but my daughter's godfather

293
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:13,090
and a close personal friend
of nearly 20 years,

294
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:16,327
I'd have you back doing guard duty
at the public library!

295
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,963
I request no special attention
because of my family.

296
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:22,050
Don't tell me what you request!

297
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:24,484
I owe your old man!

298
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:27,772
Your grandfather talked me
into being a cop!

299
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:29,852
He used to walk
the toughest beat in Boston.

300
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,931
All he carried was a rolled-up newspaper!

301
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:33,328
He still carries it.

302
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:39,208
Until this came, I was a desperate man

303
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,764
faced with two choices...

304
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:44,005
Retirement or murdering you.

305
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:46,293
Gee, I don't know what to say.

306
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,853
Fortunately, you don't
have to say anything.

307
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:52,166
The Police Commissioner
said it for both of us.

308
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,330
Congratulations, Sleigh.

309
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,330
You're assigned to
special duty with Sûreté.

310
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,611
Sûreté? Me?

311
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,088
Paris, France?

312
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:12,212
There must be some mistake.

313
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:14,568
Oh, undoubtedly.

314
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:19,016
I trust you'll bring this error
to the Commissioner's attention.

315
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:23,897
I considered it.

316
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:27,057
But then I remembered
the immortal words of Theodore Doppler,

317
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,257
the Goose Bay Strangler,
whose death sentence

318
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,777
was commuted two minutes
before they pulled the switch.

319
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:36,091
"Never look a gift horse in the mouth."

320
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:39,895
Bon voyage, Sleigh.

321
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:48,099
My bag.

322
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:14,298
Hey, business is booming
since Clouseau disappeared, huh?

323
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:17,419
Yeah. My books show
an increase of 18% since February.

324
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:19,339
Gambling accounted for half a billion.

325
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,735
Nearly double last year.

326
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,298
You think that's good?

327
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,896
Wait'll you hear the rundown
on drugs and prostitution.

328
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:27,420
Hold it a second.
It don't take a genius to know

329
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:29,656
that when Clouseau isn't around,
business flourishes.

330
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:32,104
Still hard to believe.
You ever meet the guy?

331
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,744
Yeah, I met him once.
He acted like a real idiot.

332
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:36,104
Facts are facts.

333
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:39,265
If this American detective
is as good as they say he is,

334
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,497
we're gonna have Clouseau
right back in our laps.

335
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,145
Maybe Clouseau isn't just missing.

336
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:45,941
Yeah. Maybe he's dead.

337
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,218
Can't take that chance.

338
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:49,946
So what do we do?

339
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:51,785
We get rid of the American.

340
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:55,427
I'll call Galucci in Chicago,
have him put out a contract.

341
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:04,580
Trans World Airlines
StarStream, Flight 24...

342
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,943
For Chicago and Dayton...

343
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,428
Will depart from Gate 39.

344
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,941
Passengers may proceed to the gate area
for check-in.

345
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:34,984
Trans World Airlines
StarStream, Flight 24...

346
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,346
For Chicago and Dayton...

347
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:40,831
Will depart from Gate 39.

348
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:45,343
Passengers may proceed to the gate area
for check-in.

349
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,426
Excuse me, please, but where I check in?

350
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:16,394
- Check in?
- Check in.

351
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:17,994
Right over there.

352
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,157
How did it happen?

353
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,794
We don't know. He fell from a balcony.

354
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,669
Never got a shot at him.

355
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,598
When does this Sergeant Sleigh land?

356
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,277
11:20 tomorrow morning. TWA.

357
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,111
- You want us to hit him at the airport?
- Right.

358
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,198
Ray, this time no slip-ups.

359
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:29,554
It's very nice to see you.

360
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:31,914
We've been waiting for you.

361
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,322
Yes, Commissioner?

362
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:15,439
Yes, quite remarkable.

363
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:20,927
It seems the computer certainly picked
the right man for the job.

364
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:26,323
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

365
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,200
Yes?

366
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,529
Detective Sleigh has arrived.

367
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,205
Show him in.

368
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:44,961
Detective Sergeant Clifton Sleigh.

369
00:28:57,893 --> 00:28:59,247
How is he, Doctor?

370
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,767
He'll be here for a few weeks,
but he's very lucky.

371
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:03,087
We just got him in time.

372
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:05,007
He could have choked to death
on that goldfish.

373
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,327
Can I see him?

374
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:09,525
Yes, but don't stay too long.
He's very tired.

375
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:17,089
Hello.

376
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:21,489
I won't stay long.

377
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:23,606
I wish I could say the same.

378
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:26,326
Is there anything I can do for you?

379
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:29,694
Are you in much pain?

380
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:33,771
My leg hurts, but my throat is killing me.

381
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,291
You nearly choked to death on a goldfish.

382
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:38,727
Where is he?

383
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,454
I don't know. I don't think they kept it.

384
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:44,932
Not the fish! Detective Sleigh!

385
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:48,172
He waited around
until he heard you were all right,

386
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,256
then he went over to
Clouseau's apartment.

387
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:52,488
But he said he'd be back
to see you this evening.

388
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:53,615
Wonderful.

389
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:55,413
He said he wanted to make it up to you

390
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:58,053
by solving the case as quickly as possible.

391
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,373
You know, François,

392
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:03,934
I have a horrible feeling
we are seeing history repeat itself.

393
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,609
What do you mean?

394
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,570
When they were pulling out the goldfish,

395
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,210
I remember thinking,

396
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,772
"Did Clouseau have
any relatives in the States?"

397
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:17,179
You mean... Oh, but that's impossible.

398
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:19,619
You programmed the computer yourself.

399
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:24,336
Compared to me, I'm afraid,

400
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,140
Baron Frankenstein was a quack.

401
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:43,040
Oh, God! Oh, God!

402
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:38,477
Inspector Clouseau Museum.

403
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,162
This is Balls. Is this Cato?

404
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:42,922
No. This is Sumo the night janitor.

405
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:44,842
Mr. Cato is in South America.

406
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,122
- Merde!
- I am not giving you any merde.

407
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,366
Where's the money?

408
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,763
I don't know anything
about any money he owes you.

409
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,606
If you want to get in touch with him,

410
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:54,162
he can be reached at the Rio Hilton.

411
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,440
More merde!

412
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:57,079
And the same to you, Professor.

413
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,847
Allow me to introduce myself.

414
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,920
I am Cato.

415
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,960
I thought you said your name was Sumo

416
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:09,961
and that Cato was in South America.

417
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,244
Only where Professor Balls is concerned.

418
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:16,643
Inspector Clouseau disappeared
owing the Professor 4,000 francs.

419
00:35:16,732 --> 00:35:19,209
And he keeps threatening
to close down the museum

420
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:20,962
and take back all his disguises.

421
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:23,361
I'd give him something on account,

422
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:26,890
but I only make enough to pay the utilities
and keep myself in Ying Gow San.

423
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,403
I don't believe I know the dish.

424
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,043
It's my girlfriend.

425
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:32,083
I'm sorry I attacked you.

426
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:36,011
You thought I was from
the collection agency.

427
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,451
No. I know who you are.

428
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:40,608
I was hoping I could beat you up so badly

429
00:35:40,694 --> 00:35:43,128
you might give up trying
to find Inspector Clouseau.

430
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:46,604
Why don't you want me to find him?

431
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:50,689
Because he used to beat me up so badly
I kept wishing he would disappear.

432
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:53,929
There's an old Chinese saying...

433
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:02,054
You speak Chinese?

434
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:04,526
No.

435
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,687
Well, the nearest English
equivalent would be,

436
00:36:07,777 --> 00:36:09,808
"Never look a gift horse in the mouth."

437
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:12,370
Would you like some tea?

438
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:15,851
No. I've got to crack this case,
and I'm on a tight schedule.

439
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:18,535
Tell me about this Professor Balls.

440
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:21,936
He used to make all of
the Inspector's disguises.

441
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:23,688
As a matter of fact,

442
00:36:24,338 --> 00:36:27,416
he was the last one
to see the Inspector alive.

443
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,929
You don't say.

444
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,578
That's him.

445
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:16,301
Can I help you?

446
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:19,658
Yes. I'd like to see Professor Balls.

447
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:37,576
There is someone here
to see the Professor.

448
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:06,226
Professor Balls?

449
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:10,147
Do we know each other?

450
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:12,143
I'm...

451
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:17,780
I'm a police officer.

452
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,701
I was in Zagreb visiting
my half-brother at the monastery.

453
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,745
I only want to ask you a few questions.

454
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:29,221
Nevertheless, I have a perfect alibi.

455
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:30,502
For what?

456
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:31,901
For practically anything.

457
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:34,469
I am a law-abiding citizen. Right, Cunny?

458
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:36,221
My little friend here will back me up.

459
00:38:36,312 --> 00:38:38,462
Right, Cunny?
All right, Cunny, that's enough.

460
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:39,982
All right, all right! Down!

461
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:43,623
He's been with me for 20 years.

462
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:45,906
Sometimes he thinks I'm his girlfriend.

463
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:48,863
He is also the best fitter in Paris, monsieur.

464
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,742
In all of France, for that matter.

465
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:54,305
He can whip you up a very nice suit
with two pair of pants while you wait.

466
00:38:54,394 --> 00:38:56,587
- What do you say?
- No, you see, I'm investigating...

467
00:38:56,674 --> 00:38:58,671
Of course you are investigating.

468
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,227
You are a policeman!

469
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:02,989
I knew that the moment
you walked into my emporium...

470
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,632
Your courage, your alertness,
the way your eyes take in everything.

471
00:39:06,715 --> 00:39:08,068
I immediately said to myself,

472
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:11,429
"Balls, this is a policeman's policeman."

473
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,666
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

474
00:39:13,756 --> 00:39:15,906
- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-two.

475
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:20,470
Six... Four... Twelve.

476
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:23,711
Yes, well, I have been servicing
the police all of my life, monsieur.

477
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:26,274
Some of my best customers
have been the police.

478
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:28,268
Chief Inspector Clouseau himself

479
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:30,791
used to come into my shop here
three or four nights a week

480
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:34,915
just browsing, finding an odd nose,
a unique goiter, a carbuncle,

481
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,515
perhaps something in a nice hump.

482
00:39:36,598 --> 00:39:41,389
Yes, I personally designed und executed
all of his famous disguises.

483
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:45,473
Take, for example,
his last and greatest disguise.

484
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:49,030
He was due to pick it up
on the day he disappeared.

485
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,117
It probably would have saved his life.

486
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,758
Behold, the Instant Companion Kit.

487
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,558
How many times have you been on a case

488
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,310
and discovered you were being followed?

489
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,391
How many times have you wished
that you had just one diversion

490
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,755
that would confuse your pursuer,
allowing you time to escape?

491
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,871
Well, here we have the perfect diversion.

492
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:11,799
Life-size, und instantly inflatable.

493
00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:13,192
One switch of the valve,

494
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:15,759
and you are checking into a hotel
as man and wife.

495
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:18,473
Two twists, ménage à trois, ja?

496
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,600
As Chief Inspector Clouseau,
the king of disguises,

497
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:23,800
said to me when we tested the prototype,

498
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:27,593
"Balls, as disguises go,
the Instant Companion Kit

499
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:29,397
"is without peers."

500
00:40:30,403 --> 00:40:33,001
I can let you have it for... 6,000 francs.

501
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,556
6,000?

502
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:36,793
Four. Get the doggy.

503
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:38,641
And to round out the ensemble,

504
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:42,358
I throw in the Instant Companion Pet
for All Seasons.

505
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:43,394
Observe.

506
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:46,759
Behold, here are little wheels
concealed in his paws.

507
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,716
Every 30 feet, he barks and goes ca-ca.

508
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:52,519
4,000?

509
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:57,037
All right, 3,000, including the leash
and two extra cans of ca-ca.

510
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:01,724
How about 1,500 for the entire ensemble
and all the ca-ca?

511
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,077
I've got to get this stuff off my hands.

512
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:28,759
That makes three attempts
on my life in two days.

513
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:31,447
I am lucky. I have only had one.

514
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,244
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

515
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,803
That makes us even.

516
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,723
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

517
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,648
I guess I was just too gung-ho.

518
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,520
Gung who?

519
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,444
It's an American expression.

520
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:49,605
It means... "All fired up,"
full of spirit and determination.

521
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:52,410
Do you know what this opportunity
means to me?

522
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:54,926
I'm a third-generation police officer.

523
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,402
My grandfather and my father
were captains.

524
00:41:57,812 --> 00:42:00,366
Your family must be very proud of you.

525
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:02,209
They still can't believe it.

526
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:03,603
Neither can I.

527
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,604
Me, out of all those millions.

528
00:42:06,613 --> 00:42:09,287
My grandfather tells everyone
it's a practical joke.

529
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,571
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

530
00:42:12,653 --> 00:42:14,367
This is my chance.

531
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:16,931
If I succeed,
then I've proved once and for all

532
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:19,611
that I'm a credit to the force,
that I'm a Sleigh.

533
00:42:19,694 --> 00:42:22,969
Well, credit to the force,
where do you go from here?

534
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:25,324
Well, since Inspector Clouseau disappeared

535
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:27,532
while investigating
the theft of the Pink Panther,

536
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:29,613
I thought I'd visit the scene of the crime.

537
00:42:29,695 --> 00:42:32,205
- Then you're off to Lugash?
- I leave on the next plane.

538
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:35,046
You leave? Good. I mean, good luck.

539
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:37,854
Thank you.

540
00:42:41,216 --> 00:42:43,694
You know, I just want to tell you
how grateful I am...

541
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:02,295
What time does he arrive?

542
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,649
The 1:30 plane from Paris.

543
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:09,777
You realize what happens
if he finds that cursed diamond?

544
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,533
You'll have to return the money
to the insurance company.

545
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,930
And I've already spent it.

546
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,614
What's the alternative?

547
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,331
Make sure he doesn't find the diamond.

548
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:34,136
Well, obviously the first thing to do
is to figure out how the thief got in.

549
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:44,297
I don't think we've got
a thing to worry about.

550
00:43:44,382 --> 00:43:47,220
That's what they thought about Clouseau.

551
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:50,697
He suspects Sir Charles Litton,
the notorious Phantom.

552
00:43:50,784 --> 00:43:54,221
He's booked the evening flight
for the south of France.

553
00:43:54,304 --> 00:43:58,658
The south of France
should be beautiful this time of year.

554
00:43:58,745 --> 00:44:01,779
Unless you happen to
fall off the Grande Corniche.

555
00:44:16,426 --> 00:44:19,144
I just had word that
he's arrived in the south of France.

556
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:21,060
When he left Nice airport,

557
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:25,021
he was followed by two members
of the Lugash secret police.

558
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:26,941
It appears that President Haleesh

559
00:44:27,028 --> 00:44:30,105
would rather have the insurance money
than the diamond.

560
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:36,022
When you take into account that the mob
has already tried to kill him three times

561
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,826
to stop him from finding
Inspector Clouseau...

562
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,426
Chief Inspector.

563
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:43,226
I don't think that we've got
anything to worry about.

564
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:48,307
Still, all things considered,
I'm glad you had the surgery.

565
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,660
Even though you're
temporarily incapacitated,

566
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:55,548
in the long run, I'm sure
it will be more than worth the time.

567
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:15,389
Sure, pal.

568
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:56,349
Tell him he's here.

569
00:45:56,436 --> 00:45:57,473
He's here.

570
00:45:58,036 --> 00:45:59,586
- Sergeant Sleigh.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:01,587
Let me introduce you
to my nephew George.

572
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:02,713
- George.
- How do you do?

573
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:04,914
- Hugo, chair.
- Mr. Chair.

574
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:06,547
And my wife.

575
00:46:06,637 --> 00:46:08,394
Hello. How do you do?

576
00:46:11,878 --> 00:46:12,795
Hello.

577
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:16,076
So... You're investigating
the Clouseau case.

578
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:17,108
Yes.

579
00:46:19,238 --> 00:46:20,832
- Allow me, sir.
- Thank you.

580
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:25,273
You wouldn't by any chance be related?

581
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,634
To Inspector Clouseau? No, but...

582
00:46:30,919 --> 00:46:33,277
But it's funny you should ask me that.

583
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,630
The president of Lugash
asked me the same thing.

584
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,833
Really?

585
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,673
What about a drink, Sergeant?

586
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:42,314
Oh, no, thank you.

587
00:46:42,401 --> 00:46:44,039
Darling, the Sergeant's on duty.

588
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:45,399
It's not that.

589
00:46:46,121 --> 00:46:48,435
Then what about a nice cup of tea?

590
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:50,279
Actually, it's a lot better
for you than coffee.

591
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:52,436
It's got about
half the amount of caffeine in it.

592
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:56,560
I'm sure that's true, but I'd simply die
without my morning cup of coffee.

593
00:46:56,643 --> 00:46:59,120
Anyway, what were you saying, Sergeant?

594
00:47:00,843 --> 00:47:01,836
I...

595
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:06,473
You were saying about the investigation
of Inspector Clouseau.

596
00:47:06,563 --> 00:47:07,512
Yes.

597
00:47:13,684 --> 00:47:15,157
Allow me, sir.

598
00:47:34,366 --> 00:47:36,921
You wanted to know
if Clouseau questioned me

599
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:38,917
about the theft of the Pink Panther.

600
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

601
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:42,645
He questioned me.

602
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:43,798
He did?

603
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:46,845
Oh, yes. He questioned me
three days after the robbery,

604
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:50,245
on the third of August,
to be precise, at 1:15.

605
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:51,605
He stayed for lunch.

606
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:52,845
And fell in the pool.

607
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:54,445
But why in the world would he think

608
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:57,083
that you would know anything
about the theft of the Pink Panther?

609
00:47:57,168 --> 00:47:58,882
Oh, come on, George.

610
00:47:58,968 --> 00:48:01,926
I mean, I'm sure the sergeant
is totally up-to-date

611
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:03,723
on my somewhat checkered career.

612
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:04,759
Right, Sergeant?

613
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:09,684
I mean, after all,
a man who for almost 30 years

614
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,968
has been thought to be
the notorious Phantom,

615
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,201
the cleverest jewel thief in all of Europe.

616
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:19,044
But Uncle Charles, it was never proven
that you were the Phantom.

617
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,881
No, nor that you took over where I left off.

618
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:24,929
But, George, you can understand
why he was suspicious

619
00:48:25,011 --> 00:48:26,725
and why he wanted to question me.

620
00:48:26,811 --> 00:48:28,121
Oh, sure.

621
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:31,322
And then, when he was satisfied
that I was completely innocent

622
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:34,250
and couldn't possibly have had
anything to do with it...

623
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:37,170
Because we were in Barbados
with George at the time of the robbery.

624
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:40,690
...then Inspector Clouseau
took off for Valencia.

625
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:41,931
Valencia?

626
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:47,411
Well, that leaves me
with just one question.

627
00:48:55,254 --> 00:48:56,608
You said Valencia?

628
00:48:56,694 --> 00:48:58,047
It's in Spain.

629
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:00,372
That Valencia!

630
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:03,805
Thank you very much.

631
00:49:05,335 --> 00:49:06,252
Good-bye.

632
00:49:06,335 --> 00:49:07,853
- Good-bye.
- Sir Charles.

633
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:09,325
Lady Litton.

634
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,890
He fell in the pool!

635
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:18,970
You're kidding.

636
00:49:29,978 --> 00:49:32,096
You're sure you don't want
a bathrobe or something?

637
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,055
Oh, no. I've been enough trouble.

638
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,412
It's a warm day.
I can dry off on my way to Spain.

639
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:39,256
Well, good-bye, Sergeant.

640
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:40,617
Good-bye.

641
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:42,456
- Bye-bye, Sergeant.
- Bye-bye.

642
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,730
What do you think he'll find in Valencia?

643
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:58,051
Not very much,
unless he gets his glasses fixed.

644
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:08,535
Take me to the nearest hotel.

645
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:11,736
I thought you spoke English.

646
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:24,181
Check.

647
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:34,614
Don't get too close.

648
00:50:40,465 --> 00:50:41,775
That's him.

649
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:00,540
Holy merde!

650
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:08,502
I'm allez-ing as fast as I can, man!

651
00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:10,499
You said you didn't speak any English!

652
00:51:10,588 --> 00:51:13,262
Don't you know that French cab drivers
are notoriously unreliable?

653
00:51:13,348 --> 00:51:14,985
You sound like an American to me.

654
00:51:15,069 --> 00:51:16,379
Pick, pick, pick.

655
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:22,219
Damn! Who the hell's trying to kill you?

656
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:23,739
I don't know!

657
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,061
Maybe they're trying to kill me!
Who do I know that wants to kill me?

658
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,464
No, it couldn't be my wife.
She doesn't drive.

659
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,549
Well, whoever it is,
you've got to try and lose 'em!

660
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:41,829
When somebody's shooting at you,
you gotta do better than try!

661
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,113
Come on, come on, come on...

662
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:00,081
Yes.

663
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:03,202
Something to eat?

664
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:04,241
No.

665
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:07,601
Beer, please.

666
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:09,406
Deux beers, s'il vous plaît.

667
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:25,044
Lovely here, isn't it?

668
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,091
It's a filthy habit.

669
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:39,904
Another?

670
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,537
No. Let's go.

671
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:52,179
Let's go, Shirley. Come on.

672
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,186
No, I can't.

673
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:55,823
Come on. Let's go.

674
00:58:01,389 --> 00:58:02,743
Say good-bye.

675
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,108
Bye-bye.

676
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,588
What? You want to get a room here?

677
00:58:12,671 --> 00:58:13,981
You do?

678
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:42,952
- I speak English.
- Good. Do you have a room?

679
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:44,703
For how many persons?

680
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:47,032
Just me and the little woman.

681
00:58:48,434 --> 00:58:50,148
How long are you planning to stay?

682
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,592
Just... One night.

683
00:58:54,554 --> 00:58:57,785
200 francs. Checkout time is 10:00 a.m.

684
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:04,226
Told you not to mix your drinks.

685
00:59:05,196 --> 00:59:06,713
The bridal suite.

686
00:59:07,957 --> 00:59:10,587
- Do we have a bridal suite?
- We have now.

687
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,707
Have a pleasant stay...

688
00:59:18,437 --> 00:59:19,627
Mr. Smith.

689
00:59:19,717 --> 00:59:20,995
Thank you.

690
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:09,036
Shirley! I'm sorry.

691
01:00:57,207 --> 01:00:59,325
Yes, this is Monsieur Smith.

692
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:02,642
I would like to make a call to Paris.
St. Mary's Hospital.

693
01:01:02,728 --> 01:01:04,005
- Paris?
- Yes.

694
01:01:04,088 --> 01:01:06,326
- St. Mary's Hospital.
- Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

695
01:01:06,408 --> 01:01:09,399
- Chief Inspector Dreyfus.
- And it's important!

696
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,362
Oui, Monsieur Smith.

697
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:13,566
- Hurry!
- Right away.

698
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:15,359
Excuse me.

699
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:19,527
I'm interested in Monsieur Smith.

700
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:24,479
Yes?

701
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,120
Hello, this is Sergeant Sleigh.

702
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:29,889
Oh, yes. Where the devil are you?

703
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,360
I don't know the name of the hotel...

704
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:34,481
But somebody's following me.

705
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:37,290
They tried to shoot me on the way to Nice.

706
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:41,090
Oh, my God. Hold on, I'll be right with you.

707
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,807
Hold on a sec. I've got to put the cork in.

708
01:02:02,894 --> 01:02:04,771
What cork?

709
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:07,364
What do you mean? Hello?

710
01:02:07,454 --> 01:02:09,648
Hello? Are you there?

711
01:02:09,734 --> 01:02:10,892
Hello!

712
01:02:15,495 --> 01:02:17,252
Why don't you answer?

713
01:02:18,856 --> 01:02:21,366
I'm sorry, but things are
getting a little out of hand.

714
01:02:21,456 --> 01:02:22,929
Now, where were we?

715
01:02:23,496 --> 01:02:25,253
Yes, the location of the hotel.

716
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,614
Well, it's in the...

717
01:02:28,097 --> 01:02:29,375
South of France...

718
01:02:30,176 --> 01:02:32,774
And it's on a small street...

719
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:39,375
Look, I don't know what the point of this is,

720
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:40,691
because even if I knew where I was,

721
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:42,612
you're there, and I'm...

722
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:46,376
- I'm dizzy.
- Dizzy?

723
01:02:46,459 --> 01:02:48,936
- I'm really dizzy.
- Why are you dizzy?

724
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:52,253
Must be the gas.

725
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:56,093
Gas? Why don't you open the window?

726
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,849
That's a good idea.

727
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,050
That's better.

728
01:03:13,461 --> 01:03:15,535
Hello?

729
01:03:18,902 --> 01:03:20,015
Are you there?

730
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:23,932
The explosion severely
traumatized your left eardrum,

731
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:27,253
but if you are careful
and avoid all loud noises,

732
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:30,257
partial hearing should be
restored in a few days.

733
01:03:30,343 --> 01:03:31,696
What about the ringing?

734
01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:34,053
I'm afraid that might take longer.

735
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,221
It's very loud.
I keep wanting to answer the telephone.

736
01:03:37,304 --> 01:03:40,621
Just take the medicine I prescribe
and plenty of rest.

737
01:03:40,704 --> 01:03:42,614
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

738
01:03:44,664 --> 01:03:46,814
What if I can't distinguish the difference

739
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:49,219
between the ringing in my ear
and the phone?

740
01:03:49,304 --> 01:03:50,614
That could be a problem.

741
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:51,654
What?

742
01:03:52,225 --> 01:03:54,015
It may not last much longer.

743
01:03:54,105 --> 01:03:55,982
I couldn't stand it if it did.

744
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,136
Where is Sleigh?

745
01:03:58,225 --> 01:04:00,059
On his way to Valencia.

746
01:04:00,145 --> 01:04:01,182
Valencia?

747
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:03,459
A tip, from Sir Charles.

748
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,740
There! It's getting worse!

749
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:19,864
He just checked in.

750
01:04:19,948 --> 01:04:22,425
Very convenient. Right down the hall. 311.

751
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:24,262
Not in the hotel.

752
01:04:24,348 --> 01:04:26,663
When he goes out tonight,
all those fireworks out there,

753
01:04:26,748 --> 01:04:28,298
nobody's gonna notice a little shooting.

754
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:29,579
We can't miss.

755
01:04:29,669 --> 01:04:32,986
Yeah. But just to make sure,
I've hired a backup.

756
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,626
Mr. Chong.

757
01:04:34,709 --> 01:04:36,902
Who the hell is Mr. Chong?

758
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:38,343
He's a ninja,

759
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:41,268
the most powerful human
killing machine in the world.

760
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:47,225
Visualize energy as a gathering storm.

761
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:50,068
It flows to the hand.

762
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:54,545
The hand consigns it to the primary object.

763
01:04:55,912 --> 01:04:58,826
As the primary object is destroyed,

764
01:04:58,912 --> 01:05:02,306
it is consigned to the secondary object,

765
01:05:02,393 --> 01:05:03,987
and so on...

766
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:07,346
Like an atomic chain reaction.

767
01:05:07,873 --> 01:05:09,663
I will demonstrate.

768
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:47,787
We have a problem.

769
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,114
Sergeant Sleigh has arrived in Valencia.

770
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:08,516
I understand.

771
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:10,510
One moment.

772
01:06:11,439 --> 01:06:14,070
Sergeant Sleigh wishes to speak with you.

773
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:15,109
He's here?

774
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,630
No, he's on the other line.

775
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,631
Tell him I'll be right with him.

776
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,918
Listen, he's just called.
I've got him holding on the other line.

777
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,834
- Not a word!
- Of course.

778
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:27,639
Hello.

779
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,634
Chief Vigila here.
What can I do for you, Sergeant?

780
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:34,193
I'm investigating
the disappearance of Inspector Clouseau.

781
01:06:34,601 --> 01:06:35,551
What?

782
01:06:35,642 --> 01:06:38,752
Wait a minute. I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I'm gonna close the window.

783
01:06:38,842 --> 01:06:40,075
What?

784
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,919
I'm going to close the window.

785
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:42,951
What?

786
01:06:43,443 --> 01:06:45,112
What are you talking about?

787
01:06:57,124 --> 01:06:58,521
Okay, I closed it.

788
01:06:58,604 --> 01:07:01,114
Thank you for your cooperation.
I'll be right over.

789
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:17,409
Will you hold him, please?

790
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:30,607
You should be ashamed of yourself,
young man.

791
01:08:57,016 --> 01:08:58,533
Where's the police station?

792
01:08:58,616 --> 01:09:00,286
Over there, by the palazzo.

793
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:01,653
Thank you!

794
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:07,654
Don't lose him!

795
01:09:08,217 --> 01:09:09,931
Go around that way!

796
01:09:10,457 --> 01:09:11,451
Come on!

797
01:10:58,348 --> 01:10:59,385
Hi.

798
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:02,099
Hi. Hey, you're the girl from the elevator.

799
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:03,706
Yeah.

800
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:05,623
What are you doing?

801
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,020
Nothing.

802
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:09,659
Is anything the matter?

803
01:11:09,749 --> 01:11:11,867
Look, you're not gonna believe this,

804
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:13,587
but some men are trying to kill me.

805
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,068
- You're right.
- I am?

806
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,503
I'm not gonna believe you.

807
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:19,100
No, seriously.
They were just shooting at me outside.

808
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:22,584
- Look, are you alone?
- Yes.

809
01:11:22,671 --> 01:11:24,265
- Have you got a table?
- Yes.

810
01:11:24,351 --> 01:11:26,065
Would you mind being
my Instant Companion?

811
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:27,505
Your instant what?

812
01:11:27,591 --> 01:11:30,188
Look, normally I wouldn't impose,
but my other one blew up.

813
01:11:31,311 --> 01:11:33,866
I'll explain everything to you on the way.
Where's your table?

814
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:50,987
- Do you see them?
- No.

815
01:11:52,194 --> 01:11:54,432
Well, if you see them, kiss me.

816
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:55,864
Kiss you?

817
01:11:55,954 --> 01:11:57,788
Well, they're not looking for a couple.

818
01:11:58,395 --> 01:12:00,752
That's the Instant Companion theory.

819
01:12:00,835 --> 01:12:02,352
Do you know Professor Balls?

820
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:03,384
Who?

821
01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:07,670
Professor Balls.

822
01:12:07,755 --> 01:12:09,545
- Do you see them?
- One of 'em.

823
01:12:09,636 --> 01:12:11,393
- Where?
- Over by the door.

824
01:12:15,396 --> 01:12:16,826
Don't see him now.

825
01:12:18,516 --> 01:12:20,470
Strange. He's gone.

826
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:27,035
Are you sure you saw them?

827
01:12:27,117 --> 01:12:28,514
Of course. That's why I kissed you.

828
01:12:29,118 --> 01:12:30,111
Of course.

829
01:12:30,758 --> 01:12:32,231
Wait a minute.

830
01:12:32,317 --> 01:12:35,548
You don't think I pretended
to see that guy just so I could kiss you!

831
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:38,432
The thought did occur to me.

832
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:42,632
There he is again!

833
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:50,477
- Do you see him?
- He's gone.

834
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,118
I don't believe it.

835
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,274
I saw him both times.

836
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:02,114
You don't believe me, do you?

837
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:05,795
Does it matter?

838
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,676
Well, whether you saw the man or not,

839
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:10,235
I quite enjoyed it.

840
01:13:10,802 --> 01:13:12,592
- You did?
- Didn't you?

841
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:16,476
Well, now that you mention it, I guess I did.

842
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:17,753
Well?

843
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,112
Think I see him again.

844
01:13:22,642 --> 01:13:23,592
Good.

845
01:13:33,484 --> 01:13:35,034
See what I mean?

846
01:13:37,444 --> 01:13:38,917
I certainly do.

847
01:13:39,004 --> 01:13:41,275
I'm kissing you,
and I don't even know your name.

848
01:13:41,365 --> 01:13:45,119
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
You're kissing a dead duck.

849
01:14:12,808 --> 01:14:13,999
Garbage!

850
01:14:28,769 --> 01:14:32,000
Look, she doesn't have
anything to do with this.

851
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,039
That's a shame.

852
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,363
Excuse me.

853
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:36,207
Listen, I still don't know your name.

854
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:37,239
Clifton.

855
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:41,284
Catch me, I'm gonna faint.

856
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:21,208
I'm coming!

857
01:15:21,295 --> 01:15:23,368
I'm going!

858
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:59,136
Don't worry about a thing.
I've got these guys just where I want 'em.

859
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:00,289
Look out!

860
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:03,572
Oh, no!

861
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,290
Now I'm mad!

862
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:11,293
Now I'm hurt!

863
01:17:22,147 --> 01:17:24,177
Sweetheart, are you all right?

864
01:17:25,827 --> 01:17:27,344
Come on, let's get out of here.

865
01:17:27,428 --> 01:17:29,022
Clifton!

866
01:17:34,468 --> 01:17:35,701
Oh, boy.

867
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:15,422
Oh, no!

868
01:18:39,555 --> 01:18:40,908
Wait. This way.

869
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:43,145
- Why?
- I have to see the chief of police.

870
01:18:43,235 --> 01:18:44,785
- No!
- Why not?

871
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,109
I can't explain.

872
01:18:50,276 --> 01:18:51,870
Good-bye, Clifton.

873
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,789
Hello?

874
01:19:30,881 --> 01:19:32,311
He hasn't shown up yet.

875
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,398
He just went into the hotel.

876
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,237
I'll be there. Ten minutes.

877
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:37,270
Good.

878
01:20:05,363 --> 01:20:07,874
Yes, this is Sergeant Sleigh in Room 311.

879
01:20:07,964 --> 01:20:10,518
Can you tell me the name of
the young lady in Room 310?

880
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,115
- Juleta Shane.
- Thank you very much.

881
01:20:18,685 --> 01:20:20,596
I knocked on your door.

882
01:20:20,685 --> 01:20:22,715
I told the bellboy I was your sister.

883
01:20:22,805 --> 01:20:25,163
I don't think he believed me.

884
01:20:25,765 --> 01:20:27,119
Did I wake you?

885
01:20:27,606 --> 01:20:28,676
No, why?

886
01:20:29,726 --> 01:20:31,483
Well, you're wearing my pajamas.

887
01:20:33,086 --> 01:20:34,440
Only the top.

888
01:20:37,247 --> 01:20:38,645
Does it bother you?

889
01:20:39,287 --> 01:20:40,237
No.

890
01:20:44,727 --> 01:20:47,085
I charged the champagne to your room.
I hope you don't mind.

891
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:49,001
I don't mind at all.

892
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:58,447
Here's to the rest of the night
with an option on tomorrow.

893
01:21:05,529 --> 01:21:07,047
I can't stay.

894
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:11,525
See, I had a very important meeting
with the chief of police...

895
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:15,808
I couldn't let you just run off like that.
I had to find you.

896
01:21:15,891 --> 01:21:20,125
But... Now that I have found you,
I have to keep that meeting.

897
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:22,482
I'm a...

898
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:26,850
I'm a police officer.

899
01:21:27,852 --> 01:21:29,086
Police.

900
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:32,207
And I'm working on a case,

901
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:35,010
a very important case,

902
01:21:35,693 --> 01:21:38,247
and I think I'm getting close to the answer.

903
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,243
I think that's why those men were...

904
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:42,768
Were trying to kill me tonight.

905
01:21:42,853 --> 01:21:46,651
By the way, where did you
learn to fight like that?

906
01:21:47,454 --> 01:21:50,609
I was raised in the East End of London,

907
01:21:50,694 --> 01:21:54,492
where you had to learn how to fight
if you wanted to keep your integrity.

908
01:21:56,294 --> 01:21:59,449
I'll be back as soon as I can.

909
01:21:59,895 --> 01:22:01,205
I won't be here.

910
01:22:01,736 --> 01:22:02,926
Why not?

911
01:22:03,175 --> 01:22:04,486
Because I won't.

912
01:22:04,576 --> 01:22:08,646
I'm touchy about throwing myself
at a man and then being rejected.

913
01:22:08,736 --> 01:22:10,374
But I'm not rejecting you.

914
01:22:10,456 --> 01:22:12,333
- Then stay.
- I can't.

915
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:13,607
But I want you.

916
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:14,930
Oh, God.

917
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:16,327
Now.

918
01:22:16,417 --> 01:22:19,495
Couldn't you just hold out for
maybe half an hour?

919
01:22:19,578 --> 01:22:20,494
No.

920
01:22:20,577 --> 01:22:22,094
Twenty-five minutes. I'll run.

921
01:22:22,178 --> 01:22:23,368
I can't wait.

922
01:22:23,457 --> 01:22:25,935
But you don't understand.
This is my big chance.

923
01:22:26,018 --> 01:22:27,089
Don't blow it.

924
01:22:27,178 --> 01:22:30,812
No, I mean to prove once and for all
that I'm a good cop.

925
01:22:30,898 --> 01:22:32,896
And I want you to prove it too.

926
01:22:33,858 --> 01:22:35,769
I mean, to my family...

927
01:22:36,259 --> 01:22:40,254
To Lieutenant Palmyra
and the 28th Precinct...

928
01:22:40,339 --> 01:22:42,816
My goofy grandfather
and his rolled-up newspaper,

929
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,971
and my father's medals,

930
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:51,338
and his citation from the governor
for bravery.

931
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,297
You don't understand.

932
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:56,338
Oh, my God, I sound like Stan Laurel.

933
01:22:58,341 --> 01:22:59,814
I've got to go.

934
01:23:01,061 --> 01:23:03,015
I hope you're here when I get back.

935
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:13,856
What?

936
01:23:15,303 --> 01:23:18,173
Here's to being here when you get back.

937
01:23:24,264 --> 01:23:25,574
I'll drink to that.

938
01:23:37,225 --> 01:23:38,982
What's wrong? Juleta?

939
01:23:41,826 --> 01:23:43,136
Oh, my God.

940
01:23:52,267 --> 01:23:54,537
Get a doctor! It's an emergency!

941
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:57,345
Room 311. And send the police!

942
01:24:28,911 --> 01:24:30,788
Probably a powerful tranquilizer.

943
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:33,621
She'll recover,
but she'll be unconscious for hours.

944
01:24:33,711 --> 01:24:35,064
I recognize her.

945
01:24:35,151 --> 01:24:37,344
She's the Countess Chandra's
personal secretary.

946
01:24:37,431 --> 01:24:38,588
Her name's Juleta Shane.

947
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:40,188
Her name is Julie Morgan.

948
01:24:40,272 --> 01:24:41,941
She has been with the Countess
for seven years.

949
01:24:42,032 --> 01:24:45,349
- Who's this Countess...
- I ask the questions, señor Sleigh.

950
01:24:45,432 --> 01:24:46,742
Sergeant Sleigh.

951
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,906
Is that "Slay," as in "kill"?

952
01:24:48,992 --> 01:24:51,589
No, it's "Sleigh," as in "one-horse open."

953
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:53,623
Why did you shoot her?

954
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:57,031
I didn't. I'm a New York City
police officer working with the Sûreté.

955
01:24:57,113 --> 01:24:58,947
Yes, investigating the Clouseau case.

956
01:24:59,033 --> 01:25:00,627
Yes, they said you would say this.

957
01:25:00,714 --> 01:25:03,224
- You have my identification.
- Excellent forgeries.

958
01:25:03,314 --> 01:25:05,148
Look, I can clear this up
with one phone call.

959
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:06,991
After you have answered some questions.

960
01:25:07,074 --> 01:25:08,984
I've told you everything.

961
01:25:09,074 --> 01:25:10,385
Bring him along.

962
01:25:14,915 --> 01:25:16,792
What kind of tranquilizer is it?

963
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:17,946
I don't know.

964
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:18,984
Come on.

965
01:25:29,276 --> 01:25:30,706
Get out of the way!

966
01:25:30,796 --> 01:25:32,673
Hey, come on! Move, move!

967
01:25:32,757 --> 01:25:35,267
I'm a police officer! I'm a police officer!

968
01:25:35,357 --> 01:25:37,234
Hey, come on! Move! Move it!

969
01:25:46,678 --> 01:25:48,436
Hey, what are you doing?

970
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:53,672
After him! After him!

971
01:25:53,759 --> 01:25:54,872
Move!

972
01:26:30,963 --> 01:26:33,036
Fool, you've lost him! This way!

973
01:26:37,403 --> 01:26:38,834
Good evening, Sergeant.

974
01:26:39,604 --> 01:26:41,034
Hello, Mr. Litton.

975
01:26:41,124 --> 01:26:42,674
Can I give you a lift?

976
01:26:43,924 --> 01:26:45,474
As a matter of fact, yes.

977
01:26:45,564 --> 01:26:46,797
Hop in.

978
01:27:14,927 --> 01:27:16,400
Good morning, George.

979
01:27:17,407 --> 01:27:18,565
Look what I found.

980
01:27:19,528 --> 01:27:21,318
Sergeant, you're up early.

981
01:27:21,408 --> 01:27:23,002
I haven't been to bed yet.

982
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,685
Come aboard.

983
01:27:32,089 --> 01:27:34,763
Well. You look like
you need some breakfast.

984
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:38,047
Have a little pineapple or something.
Darling, you remember Sergeant Sleigh.

985
01:27:38,129 --> 01:27:39,407
Of course I do.

986
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:40,919
- Hello, do sit down.
- Thank you.

987
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,920
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

988
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:43,926
- I'll get that.
- Thank you.

989
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:46,247
Obviously, those are not your handcuffs,
so you don't have a key.

990
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,044
Darling, may I borrow your manicure set?

991
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:49,724
- Oh, yes, darling.
- Thank you so much.

992
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:51,164
I'll time you on that, Uncle Charles.

993
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:52,528
All right. This should do it.

994
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:54,040
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

995
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:58,245
I feel I owe you an explanation.

996
01:27:58,332 --> 01:28:01,366
You see, there was this young lady
who said her name was Juleta Shane.

997
01:28:01,452 --> 01:28:03,122
Juleta. What a pretty name.

998
01:28:03,212 --> 01:28:05,285
Yes, but her real name was Julie Morgan.

999
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:08,330
- I know a Julie Morgan.
- Didn't she work for Countess Chandra?

1000
01:28:08,412 --> 01:28:09,362
Yes.

1001
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:11,406
Twelve seconds, Uncle Charles.

1002
01:28:11,493 --> 01:28:13,807
Oh, stop, George. That's not fair.
You're rushing him.

1003
01:28:13,893 --> 01:28:15,443
Yes. Don't rattle me, George.

1004
01:28:15,973 --> 01:28:17,326
Anyway, somebody shot her.

1005
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:18,363
No.

1006
01:28:18,453 --> 01:28:20,211
- With a dart.
- With a dart?

1007
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:21,811
- A tranquilizer.
- Imagine.

1008
01:28:21,894 --> 01:28:23,324
Oh, my God, it's beyond me.

1009
01:28:23,414 --> 01:28:26,285
Yes. It was somebody
in one of those big heads.

1010
01:28:26,374 --> 01:28:27,324
Big heads?

1011
01:28:27,415 --> 01:28:29,009
Yes, they had an air gun,

1012
01:28:29,094 --> 01:28:31,244
and just as we were about to
drink some champagne...

1013
01:28:31,335 --> 01:28:33,005
Pop! Right in the back of the neck.

1014
01:28:33,095 --> 01:28:34,612
- Right.
- There we are.

1015
01:28:34,695 --> 01:28:37,010
28 seconds, Uncle Charles.
You're getting a little rusty.

1016
01:28:37,095 --> 01:28:39,573
Well, all right, George.
You try the other one.

1017
01:28:39,655 --> 01:28:41,325
- All right.
- I'll time you.

1018
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,370
- Terrific.
- Ready? Go.

1019
01:28:46,376 --> 01:28:47,893
I really appreciate this.

1020
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,807
And you're not aiding
and abetting a criminal.

1021
01:28:50,896 --> 01:28:52,010
Thank God for that.

1022
01:28:52,097 --> 01:28:54,335
- You see, I was falsely accused.
- Of course.

1023
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:57,211
And now it's imperative
I find this Countess Chandra.

1024
01:28:58,057 --> 01:29:00,491
Didn't she own an exclusive
health spa in Majorca?

1025
01:29:00,578 --> 01:29:02,335
- Still does.
- Ten seconds, George.

1026
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:03,651
Don't rattle me.

1027
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,053
Majorca. I've got to get to Majorca.

1028
01:29:07,138 --> 01:29:09,015
We're going there, on our way.

1029
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:11,217
And we'll be very happy to give you a lift.

1030
01:29:11,299 --> 01:29:12,489
- Really?
- Yes.

1031
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:14,729
- Gosh, that's terrific!
- I go there every year.

1032
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:18,049
Charles won't try it. He was
in the infantry... You know, all that mud.

1033
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:19,089
Mud?

1034
01:29:19,179 --> 01:29:20,849
Well, how'd I do?

1035
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,897
Not bad. I just beat you.
Sure you won't have a pineapple?

1036
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:25,410
Okay.

1037
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,618
Thank you, Countess. I'm very grateful.

1038
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,131
It's been my pleasure.

1039
01:29:37,421 --> 01:29:38,851
We have a problem.

1040
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:40,295
Julie's in the hospital.

1041
01:29:40,862 --> 01:29:44,900
The man who Chief Vigila says shot her
with the tranquilizing dart has escaped.

1042
01:29:44,982 --> 01:29:48,453
Chief Vigila claims the man
was impersonating Sergeant Sleigh.

1043
01:29:48,542 --> 01:29:51,052
Doesn't make sense.
Julie knew what Sleigh looked like.

1044
01:29:51,143 --> 01:29:53,577
Sometimes it is possible
to look like one person,

1045
01:29:53,663 --> 01:29:55,333
but actually be another.

1046
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,453
My God!

1047
01:29:59,184 --> 01:30:00,537
It's fantastic!

1048
01:30:00,944 --> 01:30:02,222
Oh, darling!

1049
01:30:03,544 --> 01:30:05,979
Don't kiss him too hard.
His lips might fall off.

1050
01:30:06,064 --> 01:30:06,981
What?

1051
01:30:07,064 --> 01:30:09,062
Just a little surgical humor.

1052
01:30:09,745 --> 01:30:11,339
Here, have a look.

1053
01:30:12,305 --> 01:30:13,583
Happy?

1054
01:30:25,466 --> 01:30:26,864
Is that the Litton yacht?

1055
01:30:34,947 --> 01:30:38,942
You can't see the spa from here.
It's about a quarter of a mile inland.

1056
01:30:39,028 --> 01:30:40,938
Sure would like to case the layout.

1057
01:30:41,028 --> 01:30:42,622
That won't be easy.

1058
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:26,626
Have you tried that?

1059
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:28,743
No. It looks like fun.

1060
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:30,951
No, looks like suicide.

1061
01:32:07,557 --> 01:32:08,867
Oh, no!

1062
01:32:24,559 --> 01:32:25,672
Are you all right?

1063
01:32:26,398 --> 01:32:29,269
Yes. Yes, I think I am, thank you.

1064
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:30,669
I'm Countess Chandra.

1065
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:32,189
Sergeant Sleigh.

1066
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,391
- Lucky you landed in the mud.
- Yes. It's hot mud.

1067
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,270
Volcanic. It's good for the skin.

1068
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,074
Doesn't do much for the clothes, I'm afraid.

1069
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,354
- Would you like to rinse off?
- Yes, I think I would.

1070
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,389
This way.

1071
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,038
Straight ahead. To your left.

1072
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,070
Big step.

1073
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:50,394
I'll get you a towel.

1074
01:32:54,322 --> 01:32:58,076
I'm investigating
the disappearance of Inspector Clouseau.

1075
01:32:58,162 --> 01:32:59,919
You just missed Chief Vigila.

1076
01:33:00,002 --> 01:33:01,475
He says you're an imposter.

1077
01:33:01,562 --> 01:33:04,160
Oh, he does, does he? Well, I'm not.

1078
01:33:04,242 --> 01:33:06,316
And I want some answers.

1079
01:33:10,163 --> 01:33:13,677
Julie Morgan, also known as
Juleta Shane, knows who I am.

1080
01:33:13,763 --> 01:33:15,794
I'm so glad Julie's going to be all right.

1081
01:33:15,883 --> 01:33:18,273
How bizarre! A tranquilizing dart!

1082
01:33:18,363 --> 01:33:20,121
Who do you think shot her?

1083
01:33:20,204 --> 01:33:21,798
I thought you might know.

1084
01:33:21,884 --> 01:33:23,838
- Why me?
- She works for you.

1085
01:33:23,924 --> 01:33:25,355
Lots of people work for me.

1086
01:33:25,445 --> 01:33:27,638
What Julie does in her own time
is her own business.

1087
01:33:31,445 --> 01:33:32,395
My God.

1088
01:33:32,485 --> 01:33:34,242
Yes... I know that.

1089
01:33:34,325 --> 01:33:35,483
You!

1090
01:33:35,566 --> 01:33:38,076
Yes, it is me.

1091
01:33:38,726 --> 01:33:42,764
I'm just checking the bar
for the bar fleas, you know.

1092
01:33:45,126 --> 01:33:46,404
Swine step!

1093
01:33:47,846 --> 01:33:50,324
You really should do something
about your architect,

1094
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:51,641
you know, my darling.

1095
01:33:56,328 --> 01:33:58,598
- Darling?
- Yes, my darling?

1096
01:33:58,687 --> 01:34:00,325
You're smoking the wrong end.

1097
01:34:01,768 --> 01:34:03,558
Yes, I know that.

1098
01:34:03,648 --> 01:34:06,966
You don't have to tell me
I'm smoking the wrong end.

1099
01:34:07,048 --> 01:34:09,363
Do you know why
I am smoking the wrong end?

1100
01:34:09,449 --> 01:34:11,839
No, darling, but I'm sure
you've got a very good reason.

1101
01:34:11,929 --> 01:34:13,000
Right.

1102
01:34:13,089 --> 01:34:17,368
I am smoking the wrong end
because I have a very good reason.

1103
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:22,680
Are you all right?

1104
01:34:24,171 --> 01:34:28,362
Yes, of course I'm all right.
I'm examining the roof.

1105
01:34:28,451 --> 01:34:30,164
Can I give you a hand?

1106
01:34:30,251 --> 01:34:31,200
Thank you.

1107
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:34,201
Obviously you are not a smoker.

1108
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:35,569
I'm sorry.

1109
01:34:44,613 --> 01:34:47,723
Do you realize you are
wearing my ice bucket?

1110
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:50,006
I'm sorry. It's stuck.

1111
01:34:50,093 --> 01:34:52,932
Yes, well, that is no problem.
I am an expert in these matters.

1112
01:34:53,013 --> 01:34:54,050
Bend down.

1113
01:34:54,693 --> 01:34:55,927
Bend over.

1114
01:35:00,935 --> 01:35:02,168
Here, let me help.

1115
01:35:02,254 --> 01:35:04,732
Yes, it is a question of leverage.

1116
01:35:23,257 --> 01:35:25,134
Yes, that is better.

1117
01:35:26,217 --> 01:35:28,214
It goes with the suit, you know.

1118
01:35:29,097 --> 01:35:32,011
Oh, by the way, we have not
been properly introduced.

1119
01:35:32,137 --> 01:35:34,014
You of course know who I am?

1120
01:35:34,098 --> 01:35:35,331
Sergeant Sleigh.

1121
01:35:35,418 --> 01:35:37,415
No, I am not Sergeant Sleigh.

1122
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:38,851
No, I am Sergeant Sleigh.

1123
01:35:38,938 --> 01:35:41,896
Oh, yes. Now we are getting somewhere.

1124
01:35:41,978 --> 01:35:44,849
- Shall we all have a drink?
- An excellent idea.

1125
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:46,576
I will have my usual.

1126
01:35:47,299 --> 01:35:49,417
A Kahlúa and root beer.

1127
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,614
I'll just have the root beer.

1128
01:35:52,139 --> 01:35:54,573
You do not know what you are missing.

1129
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:58,251
It is a combination
that makes a real thirst-quencher.

1130
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:59,857
I'm a teetotaler.

1131
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,375
You total the tea.
I thought you were a police sergeant.

1132
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:08,455
I am. Before I left New York,
I read you were making another movie.

1133
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:10,179
He had two weeks off.

1134
01:36:10,261 --> 01:36:13,536
Yes, I have two weeks off, you know,

1135
01:36:13,622 --> 01:36:17,901
and when I have the time,
I come here to take the waters.

1136
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:19,260
Very cleansing.

1137
01:36:20,102 --> 01:36:21,772
I enjoy a good cleanse.

1138
01:36:21,863 --> 01:36:23,500
I'm afraid there's no more ice.

1139
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:24,532
That's okay.

1140
01:36:24,622 --> 01:36:27,176
Well, here's to
your investigation, Sergeant.

1141
01:36:27,263 --> 01:36:28,453
To Inspector Clouseau.

1142
01:36:28,543 --> 01:36:29,897
Chief Inspector.

1143
01:36:35,384 --> 01:36:36,497
That felt good.

1144
01:36:38,424 --> 01:36:40,094
Have you ever seen this man before?

1145
01:36:40,184 --> 01:36:43,175
No, I have never seen this man
before in my life. Never.

1146
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,015
- It's Inspector Clouseau.
- Chief Inspector.

1147
01:36:46,105 --> 01:36:48,419
- That's Inspector Clouseau?
- Chief Inspector!

1148
01:36:48,505 --> 01:36:49,542
Do you know him?

1149
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:50,695
- Yes!
- What?

1150
01:36:50,786 --> 01:36:53,504
Well, he came here about a year ago,
but he said his name was Gino Rossi.

1151
01:36:53,585 --> 01:36:55,703
He wanted the name
of a good plastic surgeon,

1152
01:36:55,786 --> 01:36:58,536
so I recommended
Dr. Prosper Stang, of Madrid.

1153
01:37:00,026 --> 01:37:00,976
Well...

1154
01:37:01,627 --> 01:37:03,024
Guess that just about does it.

1155
01:37:03,107 --> 01:37:04,056
It does?

1156
01:37:04,146 --> 01:37:07,224
Yes. There is one more thing, though.

1157
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:10,261
Could I have your autograph?

1158
01:37:11,068 --> 01:37:12,618
It's for my grandfather.

1159
01:37:14,588 --> 01:37:16,585
- Hello, oui.
- Hello, François.

1160
01:37:16,668 --> 01:37:17,738
Oh, it's you!

1161
01:37:18,588 --> 01:37:20,345
Good afternoon. Where are you?

1162
01:37:20,429 --> 01:37:22,427
I am in agony.

1163
01:37:23,188 --> 01:37:26,179
I want you to arrange for a hospital plane

1164
01:37:26,269 --> 01:37:28,779
to carry me back to Paris immediately!

1165
01:37:28,869 --> 01:37:31,467
And ask my psychiatrist

1166
01:37:31,549 --> 01:37:35,227
if he can see me five days a week,
twice a day!

1167
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:39,344
Have you heard from Sergeant Sleigh?

1168
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:42,901
He called about five minutes ago
from a health spa.

1169
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:43,984
Health spa?

1170
01:37:44,071 --> 01:37:48,021
Oui. He asked me to check on
a man named Gino Rossi,

1171
01:37:48,111 --> 01:37:50,666
then he said he was leaving for Madrid,

1172
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:54,309
to question a plastic surgeon named Stang.

1173
01:37:54,392 --> 01:37:56,662
Yes, well, good-bye, Sergeant,

1174
01:37:56,752 --> 01:37:59,110
and don't be a stranger, huh?

1175
01:37:59,633 --> 01:38:01,630
- Thank you.
- See you at the movies, huh?

1176
01:38:01,713 --> 01:38:02,662
Yes.

1177
01:38:03,633 --> 01:38:04,583
Cheerio.

1178
01:38:16,434 --> 01:38:20,352
Did that swine architect of yours
move that door by any chance?

1179
01:38:23,075 --> 01:38:24,745
There goes the last of our problems.

1180
01:38:24,835 --> 01:38:26,265
- Yes.
- Come on.

1181
01:38:26,355 --> 01:38:27,545
Where are we going?

1182
01:38:27,636 --> 01:38:30,190
Let's celebrate.
I haven't seen it for such a long time.

1183
01:38:30,275 --> 01:38:32,425
Well, I have not been too well, you know?

1184
01:38:32,516 --> 01:38:35,310
Not that! The Pink Panther!

1185
01:38:35,396 --> 01:38:37,033
I was just checking.

1186
01:38:38,716 --> 01:38:40,027
Oh, my God!

1187
01:38:43,077 --> 01:38:44,474
It's gone!

1188
01:38:48,837 --> 01:38:50,911
Swine Phantom!

1189
01:38:51,718 --> 01:38:53,387
I interrogated Dr. Stang,

1190
01:38:53,478 --> 01:38:56,032
who admitted that he had operated
on Clouseau's face.

1191
01:38:57,478 --> 01:38:59,793
This is what he looked like
after the operation.

1192
01:39:00,718 --> 01:39:04,277
He stole the Pink Panther,
had his face changed,

1193
01:39:04,359 --> 01:39:06,357
and then called himself Gino Rossi.

1194
01:39:06,439 --> 01:39:08,109
And you are sure he's dead?

1195
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:09,957
- Well, according to...
- The Valencia...

1196
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:11,389
Go ahead.

1197
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,074
- You wanted to say something?
- No, no. After you.

1198
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,590
- You're sure?
- Yes, please.

1199
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,717
All I wanted to say is that
the Valencia police

1200
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,677
identified the man in the photograph

1201
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,998
as a John Doe who had been shot,

1202
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:25,039
and whose corpse was found
washed up on the beach.

1203
01:39:25,121 --> 01:39:27,314
Obviously killed for the diamond.

1204
01:39:27,401 --> 01:39:28,351
Obviously.

1205
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:31,552
Should we have the body exhumed,
just to make sure?

1206
01:39:31,642 --> 01:39:32,591
No.

1207
01:39:33,122 --> 01:39:36,156
I have compared Clouseau's fingerprints
with those of the dead man,

1208
01:39:36,242 --> 01:39:38,676
and they are identical.

1209
01:39:38,762 --> 01:39:41,720
Oh, yes. There is no doubt
that Clouseau is dead.

1210
01:39:41,803 --> 01:39:43,560
A good cop gone bad.

1211
01:39:43,642 --> 01:39:45,192
Yes, well...

1212
01:39:46,243 --> 01:39:48,720
You've certainly proved
that you are a good cop, Sergeant,

1213
01:39:48,804 --> 01:39:50,114
a credit to the profession.

1214
01:39:50,204 --> 01:39:52,561
On behalf of the President
and the people of France,

1215
01:39:52,644 --> 01:39:54,117
I congratulate you. Good-bye.

1216
01:39:54,204 --> 01:39:55,394
Thank you, sir.

1217
01:39:56,164 --> 01:39:57,354
Good-bye.

1218
01:40:10,245 --> 01:40:16,117
Good-bye, Mr. Rossi,
alias Chief Inspector Clouseau.

1219
01:40:42,809 --> 01:40:44,403
Peace at last!

1220
01:40:48,929 --> 01:40:51,199
Well, bon voyage, Sergeant. Well done.

1221
01:40:51,289 --> 01:40:53,243
- You should come again sometime.
- Thank you.

1222
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:55,360
Help! Help!

1223
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:57,840
I'm burning! Hurry up!

1224
01:40:58,410 --> 01:40:59,763
Get the hose!

1225
01:40:59,851 --> 01:41:01,128
The hose!

1226
01:41:01,211 --> 01:41:02,160
There!

1227
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:05,728
Hurry up! Pull!

1228
01:41:05,811 --> 01:41:06,760
Help!

1229
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:11,402
Help! Hurry up!

1230
01:41:11,492 --> 01:41:12,802
Hit the water!

1231
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:14,881
Help!

1232
01:41:27,613 --> 01:41:28,563
Check.

1233
01:41:30,934 --> 01:41:31,970
Mate!

1234
01:41:35,734 --> 01:41:36,684
Beautiful.

1235
01:41:38,135 --> 01:41:40,886
Do you recommend Countess Chandra's?

1236
01:41:40,975 --> 01:41:44,970
Definitely. In fact, I'd love to
go back there and spend more time.

1237
01:41:46,135 --> 01:41:48,973
By the way, I seem to be missing a glove.

1238
01:41:49,535 --> 01:41:52,690
"Always leave something
for something," is my motto.

1239
01:41:52,776 --> 01:41:53,813
What's yours?

1240
01:41:54,856 --> 01:41:57,007
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

1241
01:42:00,017 --> 01:42:01,130
I'll drink to that.
