1
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,516
- How much?
- Six million.

2
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,019
- But that's ridiculous.
- It's worth 30.

3
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,896
It'll have to be split up.
We'll lose at least 40% of it.

4
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,443
Enough!

5
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,485
What?

6
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,858
I am Clouseau,

7
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,941
and justice will be done
in the name of the "lew."

8
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,018
One year ago today,
Inspector Jacques Clouseau,

9
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,401
the Police Academy's most
illustrious graduate, disappeared.

10
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,780
We felt it appropriate to broadcast
this commemorative program

11
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,362
from the Academy, where
a new generation of police officers

12
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,618
are about to receive their shields.

13
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,291
The question
on every Frenchman's mind is,

14
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,247
"What has happened to
France's greatest detective?

15
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,707
"Why haven't the authorities
been able to solve the mystery?"

16
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,128
Tell the police commissioner
I want to see him.

17
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,713
Oui, Monsieur Président.

18
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,760
The president himself gave the order!

19
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,847
And at 3:00 this morning,
the commissioner woke me up

20
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,854
to say he was putting me in charge. Me!

21
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,697
And I've got one month
to make Operation Paragon a success.

22
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,944
Otherwise, I'll be back on the vice squad

23
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,072
staking out pissoirs
for what is left of my career.

24
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,369
Operation Paragon?

25
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,788
Yes. The President's idea.

26
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,491
If France's greatest detective is missing,

27
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,123
then get the world's greatest detective
to find him.

28
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,671
And how do you find
the world's greatest detective?

29
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,795
By computer. The Commissioner's idea.

30
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,131
Interpol has computer files

31
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,884
on every law enforcement agency
in the world,

32
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:40,389
and I am supposed to program
the computer to select Clouseau's clone.

33
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,810
But Clouseau...

34
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,513
You know he was an idiot,
and I know he was an idiot,

35
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,941
but the rest of the world sees him
as a fearless deductive genius,

36
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,314
another Sherlock Holmes,

37
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,236
and that's the type of man
we are now looking for.

38
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,529
Then you have a problem.

39
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,108
Yes, because a man like this
might find Clouseau...

40
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,943
A horrible thought.

41
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,867
What's the alternative?

42
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,991
I don't know.

43
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,537
I'm damned if I do,
and I'm damned if I don't.

44
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,187
A series 600 Huxley computer.

45
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,563
You can program it by
voice command, you know.

46
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,315
Ouais. Observe this. Activate.

47
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,108
- Aldous.
- Ready, Dave.

48
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,741
Aldous can even recognize people's voices.

49
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,822
- Amazing.
- Elementary.

50
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,292
Chief Inspector Dreyfus, Sûreté,
vital statistics, please.

51
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,002
Coming up, Dave.

52
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,754
- What's the delay?
- Lots of material.

53
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,671
Well, just give me
an abbreviated version then.

54
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,178
All right. Charles Larousse Dreyfus.

55
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,511
Born Marseilles, April 1, 19...

56
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,562
Skip that. Skip that.

57
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,517
What is the subject's present occupation?

58
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,852
Subject's present occupation...

59
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,360
Chief Inspector, Criminal Division, Sûreté.

60
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,694
How's his health?

61
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,778
Last complete physical examination...

62
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,534
January 7th, this year.

63
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,616
Chronic hypertension.

64
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,623
May, 1978, suffered nervous breakdown

65
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,375
and was committed to the state mental...

66
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,127
- Skip!
- Sorry.

67
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,549
Do you want to ask him anything?

68
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,672
Yes.

69
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,922
What are the odds

70
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,885
that the greatest detective in the world
will find Clouseau?

71
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,266
Even money. Take your pick.

72
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,560
Well, aren't you being slightly optimistic?

73
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,144
Not at all.

74
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,402
Why? Are you afraid
he'll drive you crazy again?

75
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,357
Cool it, Aldous.

76
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,740
Just responding with
an obvious observation.

77
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,574
I hope I didn't offend you,
Inspector Dreyfus.

78
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,033
Not at all.

79
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,586
By the way, it's Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

80
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,668
Shame on you, Aldous.

81
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,592
Nobody's perfect. Have a happy day.

82
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,253
Yes?

83
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,681
Prisoner Steiger has arrived.

84
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,178
Show him in.

85
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,430
Come in.

86
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,265
Wait outside.

87
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,481
Sit down.

88
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,450
Maurice Steiger...
15 years for bank robbery.

89
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,493
How much was it?

90
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,286
About 150 million,
give or take a few francs.

91
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,123
And it's never been recovered.

92
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,091
It must be hell, sitting in prison,

93
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,515
dreaming about what
you could do with all that money.

94
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,809
It's not so bad.

95
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,184
I'm a model prisoner.
I come up for parole in six months.

96
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,938
Yes, but there's always the chance
that the Parole Board will turn you down.

97
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,269
I see.

98
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,647
I tell you where the money is,

99
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,903
you put in a good word
with the Parole Board.

100
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,567
No.

101
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,994
Listen...

102
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,786
It took a computer genius to embezzle

103
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,210
150 million francs from the Bank of France,

104
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,289
and I have a problem

105
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,625
that requires a computer genius.

106
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,084
You help me solve that problem,

107
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,545
and in 6 months' time, you'll be a free man,

108
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,599
living out 150 million dreams,

109
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,472
give or take a few dreams.

110
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,845
What's your problem?

111
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,899
Can you rig a computer

112
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,228
so that no matter what I program into it,

113
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,655
it will select the exact opposite?

114
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,573
Black is white? Day is night?

115
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,992
Exactly.

116
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,452
What sort of computer?

117
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,033
A Huxley 600.

118
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,457
There is only one of those in this country.

119
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,540
How are you going to get me into Interpol?

120
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,999
I can't.

121
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,335
Then how do you expect me to rig it?

122
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,797
I don't. I expect you to tell me how to rig it.

123
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,027
The President has just arrived,

124
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,776
and is being greeted by
Sergeant Duval of the Sûreté

125
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,153
and Secretary General Dulong of Interpol.

126
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,950
And now we switch to Michelle Chauvin,

127
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,529
who is about to interview
the star of these proceedings.

128
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,863
Good morning, Michelle.

129
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,500
This is Chief Inspector Dreyfus
of the Sûreté.

130
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,703
You are the one who is
going to program Aldous

131
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,412
to select Clouseau's successor?

132
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,496
Yes.

133
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,374
No.

134
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,336
He is not going to be Clouseau's successor.

135
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,170
Why not a she?

136
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,505
What?

137
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,761
Well, couldn't it just as easily be a woman,

138
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,594
or are you purposely
programming it to be a man?

139
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,849
No, no. We are just trying to find
the best, the most qualified...

140
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,025
The most like Clouseau?

141
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,101
Yes.

142
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,901
To paraphrase an old saying,

143
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,904
set a great detective
to find a great detective.

144
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,364
Exactly. But he or she
will not be Clouseau's successor.

145
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,621
I mean, they won't be
going to work for the Sûreté...

146
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,996
I hope.

147
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,419
Excuse me.

148
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,213
The President has just arrived.

149
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,091
In a few moments, Aldous the computer

150
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,543
will select from the files

151
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,380
of all the law enforcement
agencies in the world

152
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,385
the one man or woman

153
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,808
most qualified to solve the disappearance

154
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,305
of France's greatest detective.

155
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,183
And screw up my entire life.

156
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,479
Just over a year ago,

157
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,181
while investigating yet another theft

158
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,483
of the famous diamond, the Pink Panther,

159
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,607
Inspector Clouseau seemed to
vanish from the face of the earth,

160
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,986
leaving behind one of France's
greatest unsolved mysteries.

161
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,443
Not to mention
the 4,000 francs he owes me.

162
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,746
And now, working on the theory
that the best person to find Clouseau

163
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,415
is someone almost exactly like Clouseau,

164
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,245
Chief Inspector Dreyfus
will program Aldous the computer

165
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,955
with a character profile
of Inspector Clouseau.

166
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,837
That's going to put a hell of a strain
on poor old Aldous.

167
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,884
Obviously, Mr. President,

168
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,588
so as not to limit our choice,

169
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,676
I will omit sex, height, weight,

170
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,977
race, and nationality.

171
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,357
- Ready, Aldous?
- Ready, Charles.

172
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,984
Age... 61.

173
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,988
Senior officer.

174
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,871
I.Q...

175
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,044
Genius.

176
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,417
Specialities...

177
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,221
Judo, kung fu, Okinawan weaponry,

178
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,015
karate expert...

179
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,932
Black belt.

180
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,945
Expert ma... Ma...

181
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,697
Marksman.

182
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,609
Fearless.

183
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,112
Courageous.

184
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,745
A born leader.

185
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,457
Sir.

186
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,755
Is that it, Chief?

187
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,001
Select.

188
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,927
Coming right up.

189
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,305
What is he humming?

190
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,436
It sounds like Moon River...

191
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,984
Backwards!

192
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,189
Chief Inspector Dreyfus
is obviously nervous.

193
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,115
The President and the Commissioner

194
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,535
are waiting tensely
as the moment draws near.

195
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,328
Ladies and gentlemen,

196
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,747
after thoroughly searching the records

197
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:28,170
of 13,623,055 candidates,

198
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,791
I have come up with your man.

199
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,170
It's a man.

200
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,797
From the 11th Precinct

201
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,379
of the New York City Police Department,

202
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,887
I give you... A little drum roll, please...

203
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,986
Got a light, big boy?

204
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:58,158
Cliff, broads don't call
guys "big boy" anymore.

205
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,199
Right, Charlie.

206
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,124
I thought you didn't smoke.

207
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,793
I think it kinda goes with the look.

208
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,086
Thanks.

209
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,718
I don't believe it!
He's gonna blow their cover!

210
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,472
That's a nasty cough you got there, lady.

211
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,103
You shouldn't oughtta be smoking.

212
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,475
I lost a contact lens.

213
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,602
What?

214
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,058
I lost a lens.

215
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,311
I'll look for it later.
Can we just do with one?

216
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,647
I can't see without it,
and it cost me 85 bucks!

217
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,573
I'll lend you the money, for God's sake.

218
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,195
Oh, my... I found it.

219
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,153
Get it. Come on, let's go.

220
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:54,998
Well...

221
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,052
See you later.

222
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,641
He's gonna blow it.

223
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,518
He's gonna blow it.

224
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,819
Stay with him.

225
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,487
Don't forget the guys we're after

226
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,815
put a little old lady in the hospital.

227
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,447
I can't believe the lieutenant
would let a screw-up like Sleigh

228
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,993
work this kind of stakeout.

229
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,367
The lieutenant's been
under a lot of pressure lately.

230
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,449
Yeah? What kind of pressure?

231
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,658
Sleigh.

232
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,914
He's been driving the lieutenant bananas.

233
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,668
Maybe he hopes Sleigh will
end up like the little old lady.

234
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,044
Come on.

235
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,753
To tell you the truth, that thought
has passed through my mind.

236
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,093
Stop! Stop! Back up, back up, back up!

237
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,600
Stop! Stop! Go forward. Go forward.

238
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,189
Now, stop!

239
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,489
Hi there, beautiful.

240
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,866
Pardon me, I...

241
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,204
I feel that I know you.

242
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,121
Are you by any chance...

243
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,619
Sheila Swanhill from Petoskey, Michigan?

244
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,954
Well, if not...

245
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,546
Are you her sister,

246
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,629
or in any way related
to the Swanhill family?

247
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,887
Obviously not. If you were,
you would have recognized me by now.

248
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,971
Allow me to introduce myself.
Harley Hamilcar Ill.

249
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,602
I'm in cement.

250
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:40,563
Did you know that Petoskey
is the cement capital of the world?

251
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,524
Some drunk's trying to pick him up.

252
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,116
She had a cousin named...

253
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,079
Lindtrude.

254
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,578
My name's Derina.

255
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,168
Derina!

256
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,469
You have a lovely voice.

257
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,593
You do

258
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,970
Something to me

259
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,595
Something that

260
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,806
Simply mystifies me

261
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,937
Tell me

262
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,064
Why should it be

263
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,647
You have the power to hypnotize me?

264
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,112
It's getting out of hand.

265
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,990
...live 'neath your spell

266
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,698
Do do that voodoo that you do so well

267
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,291
What are you doing to me?

268
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,960
A real hooker's just joined the party.

269
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,294
What's all this dancing around?

270
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,723
I'm going in.

271
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,207
Not only did you screw up the stakeout,

272
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,580
but another little old lady was mugged.

273
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,128
To make matters worse,

274
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,581
we're the laughing stock
of the whole 28th Precinct,

275
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,338
and by the time those crumbs
get through spreading it around town,

276
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,508
we'll be the laughing stock

277
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,587
of the whole goddamn
New York City police force!

278
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,014
- With all due respect...
- What respect?

279
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,184
What do you know about respect?
You sure as hell don't respect me!

280
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,011
Oh, yes, I do.

281
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,188
I got an ulcer, I'm losing my hair,

282
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,516
and you're driving me
straight to the funny farm!

283
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,521
You call that respect?

284
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,695
What happened tonight
was not entirely my fault.

285
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,405
Three years on the police force,

286
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,733
you don't know
how to handle a common drunk?

287
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,324
You had to be there.

288
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,950
Sleigh...

289
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,039
If it wasn't for the fact...

290
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,256
That you're
a third-generation police officer,

291
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,004
and that your father
was not only my captain

292
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,801
but my daughter's godfather

293
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,222
and a close personal friend
of nearly 20 years,

294
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,597
I'd have you back doing guard duty
at the public library!

295
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,388
I request no special attention
because of my family.

296
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,564
Don't tell me what you request!

297
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,101
I owe your old man!

298
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,529
Your grandfather talked me
into being a cop!

299
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,698
He used to walk
the toughest beat in Boston.

300
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,866
All he carried was a rolled-up newspaper!

301
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,322
He still carries it.

302
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,453
Until this came, I was a desperate man

303
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,118
faced with two choices...

304
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,454
Retirement or murdering you.

305
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,839
Gee, I don't know what to say.

306
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,509
Fortunately, you don't
have to say anything.

307
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,963
The Police Commissioner
said it for both of us.

308
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,219
Congratulations, Sleigh.

309
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,347
You're assigned to
special duty with Sûreté.

310
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,895
Sûreté? Me?

311
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,520
Paris, France?

312
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,863
There must be some mistake.

313
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,319
Oh, undoubtedly.

314
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,957
I trust you'll bring this error
to the Commissioner's attention.

315
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,045
I considered it.

316
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,340
But then I remembered
the immortal words of Theodore Doppler,

317
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,634
the Goose Bay Strangler,
whose death sentence

318
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,304
was commuted two minutes
before they pulled the switch.

319
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,759
"Never look a gift horse in the mouth."

320
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,725
Bon voyage, Sleigh.

321
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,279
My bag.

322
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,594
Hey, business is booming
since Clouseau disappeared, huh?

323
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,848
Yeah. My books show
an increase of 18% since February.

324
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,849
Gambling accounted for half a billion.

325
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,305
Nearly double last year.

326
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,935
You think that's good?

327
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,643
Wait'll you hear the rundown
on drugs and prostitution.

328
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,275
Hold it a second.
It don't take a genius to know

329
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,606
that when Clouseau isn't around,
business flourishes.

330
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,158
Still hard to believe.
You ever meet the guy?

331
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,911
Yeah, I met him once.
He acted like a real idiot.

332
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,329
Facts are facts.

333
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,624
If this American detective
is as good as they say he is,

334
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,952
we're gonna have Clouseau
right back in our laps.

335
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,712
Maybe Clouseau isn't just missing.

336
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,585
Yeah. Maybe he's dead.

337
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,959
Can't take that chance.

338
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,760
So what do we do?

339
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,678
We get rid of the American.

340
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,475
I'll call Galucci in Chicago,
have him put out a contract.

341
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,018
Trans World Airlines
StarStream, Flight 24...

342
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,482
For Chicago and Dayton...

343
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,115
Will depart from Gate 39.

344
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,820
Passengers may proceed to the gate area
for check-in.

345
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,717
Trans World Airlines
StarStream, Flight 24...

346
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,180
For Chicago and Dayton...

347
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,813
Will depart from Gate 39.

348
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,518
Passengers may proceed to the gate area
for check-in.

349
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,840
Excuse me, please, but where I check in?

350
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,891
- Check in?
- Check in.

351
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,560
Right over there.

352
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,624
How did it happen?

353
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,373
We don't know. He fell from a balcony.

354
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,328
Never got a shot at him.

355
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,382
When does this Sergeant Sleigh land?

356
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,175
11:20 tomorrow morning. TWA.

357
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,130
- You want us to hit him at the airport?
- Right.

358
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,306
Ray, this time no slip-ups.

359
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,168
It's very nice to see you.

360
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,629
We've been waiting for you.

361
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,801
Yes, Commissioner?

362
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,008
Yes, quite remarkable.

363
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:35,730
It seems the computer certainly picked
the right man for the job.

364
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,356
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

365
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,568
Yes?

366
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,996
Detective Sleigh has arrived.

367
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,744
Show him in.

368
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,788
Detective Sergeant Clifton Sleigh.

369
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,682
How is he, Doctor?

370
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,310
He'll be here for a few weeks,
but he's very lucky.

371
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,686
We just got him in time.

372
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,688
He could have choked to death
on that goldfish.

373
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,064
Can I see him?

374
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,398
Yes, but don't stay too long.
He's very tired.

375
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,284
Hello.

376
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,872
I won't stay long.

377
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,079
I wish I could say the same.

378
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,915
Is there anything I can do for you?

379
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,426
Are you in much pain?

380
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,677
My leg hurts, but my throat is killing me.

381
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,305
You nearly choked to death on a goldfish.

382
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,844
Where is he?

383
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,688
I don't know. I don't think they kept it.

384
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:03,314
Not the fish! Detective Sleigh!

385
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,692
He waited around
until he heard you were all right,

386
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,865
then he went over to
Clouseau's apartment.

387
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,192
But he said he'd be back
to see you this evening.

388
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,367
Wonderful.

389
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,241
He said he wanted to make it up to you

390
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,994
by solving the case as quickly as possible.

391
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,370
You know, François,

392
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,125
I have a horrible feeling
we are seeing history repeat itself.

393
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,872
What do you mean?

394
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,959
When they were pulling out the goldfish,

395
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,669
I remember thinking,

396
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,382
"Did Clouseau have
any relatives in the States?"

397
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,934
You mean... Oh, but that's impossible.

398
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,478
You programmed the computer yourself.

399
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,396
Compared to me, I'm afraid,

400
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,320
Baron Frankenstein was a quack.

401
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,566
Oh, God! Oh, God!

402
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,365
Inspector Clouseau Museum.

403
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,121
This is Balls. Is this Cato?

404
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,999
No. This is Sumo the night janitor.

405
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,001
Mr. Cato is in South America.

406
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,378
- Merde!
- I am not giving you any merde.

407
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,675
Where's the money?

408
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,174
I don't know anything
about any money he owes you.

409
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,095
If you want to get in touch with him,

410
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,718
he can be reached at the Rio Hilton.

411
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,050
More merde!

412
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,759
And the same to you, Professor.

413
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,773
Allow me to introduce myself.

414
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,934
I am Cato.

415
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,104
I thought you said your name was Sumo

416
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,190
and that Cato was in South America.

417
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,570
Only where Professor Balls is concerned.

418
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:49,156
Inspector Clouseau disappeared
owing the Professor 4,000 francs.

419
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,832
And he keeps threatening
to close down the museum

420
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,659
and take back all his disguises.

421
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,161
I'd give him something on account,

422
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,840
but I only make enough to pay the utilities
and keep myself in Ying Gow San.

423
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,417
I don't believe I know the dish.

424
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,127
It's my girlfriend.

425
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,254
I'm sorry I attacked you.

426
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,350
You thought I was from
the collection agency.

427
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,894
No. I know who you are.

428
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,142
I was hoping I could beat you up so badly

429
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,770
you might give up trying
to find Inspector Clouseau.

430
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,394
Why don't you want me to find him?

431
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,653
Because he used to beat me up so badly
I kept wishing he would disappear.

432
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,031
There's an old Chinese saying...

433
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,502
You speak Chinese?

434
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,079
No.

435
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,375
Well, the nearest English
equivalent would be,

436
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,586
"Never look a gift horse in the mouth."

437
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,258
Would you like some tea?

438
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,887
No. I've got to crack this case,
and I'm on a tight schedule.

439
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,685
Tell me about this Professor Balls.

440
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,231
He used to make all of
the Inspector's disguises.

441
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,058
As a matter of fact,

442
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,945
he was the last one
to see the Inspector alive.

443
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,565
You don't say.

444
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,795
That's him.

445
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,912
Can I help you?

446
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,412
Yes. I'd like to see Professor Balls.

447
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,094
There is someone here
to see the Professor.

448
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,964
Professor Balls?

449
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,052
Do we know each other?

450
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,133
I'm...

451
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,010
I'm a police officer.

452
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:02,098
I was in Zagreb visiting
my half-brother at the monastery.

453
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,357
I only want to ask you a few questions.

454
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,939
Nevertheless, I have a perfect alibi.

455
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,274
For what?

456
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,733
For practically anything.

457
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,410
I am a law-abiding citizen. Right, Cunny?

458
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,237
My little friend here will back me up.

459
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,574
Right, Cunny?
All right, Cunny, that's enough.

460
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,158
All right, all right! Down!

461
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,954
He's been with me for 20 years.

462
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,335
Sometimes he thinks I'm his girlfriend.

463
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,418
He is also the best fitter in Paris, monsieur.

464
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,377
In all of France, for that matter.

465
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:36,091
He can whip you up a very nice suit
with two pair of pants while you wait.

466
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,471
- What do you say?
- No, you see, I'm investigating...

467
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,644
Of course you are investigating.

468
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,266
You are a policeman!

469
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,145
I knew that the moment
you walked into my emporium...

470
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,944
Your courage, your alertness,
the way your eyes take in everything.

471
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,441
I immediately said to myself,

472
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,945
"Balls, this is a policeman's policeman."

473
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,277
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

474
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,613
- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-two.

475
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,371
Six... Four... Twelve.

476
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,750
Yes, well, I have been servicing
the police all of my life, monsieur.

477
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,422
Some of my best customers
have been the police.

478
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,501
Chief Inspector Clouseau himself

479
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,132
used to come into my shop here
three or four nights a week

480
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:18,432
just browsing, finding an odd nose,
a unique goiter, a carbuncle,

481
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,100
perhaps something in a nice hump.

482
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:25,181
Yes, I personally designed und executed
all of his famous disguises.

483
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:29,439
Take, for example,
his last and greatest disguise.

484
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,148
He was due to pick it up
on the day he disappeared.

485
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,324
It probably would have saved his life.

486
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,120
Behold, the Instant Companion Kit.

487
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,039
How many times have you been on a case

488
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,866
and discovered you were being followed?

489
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,078
How many times have you wished
that you had just one diversion

490
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,585
that would confuse your pursuer,
allowing you time to escape?

491
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,834
Well, here we have the perfect diversion.

492
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,887
Life-size, und instantly inflatable.

493
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,339
One switch of the valve,

494
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,016
and you are checking into a hotel
as man and wife.

495
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,845
Two twists, ménage à trois, ja?

496
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,106
As Chief Inspector Clouseau,
the king of disguises,

497
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,399
said to me when we tested the prototype,

498
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,354
"Balls, as disguises go,
the Instant Companion Kit

499
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,235
"is without peers."

500
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,992
I can let you have it for... 6,000 francs.

501
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,614
6,000?

502
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,946
Four. Get the doggy.

503
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,873
And to round out the ensemble,

504
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,748
I throw in the Instant Companion Pet
for All Seasons.

505
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,828
Observe.

506
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,336
Behold, here are little wheels
concealed in his paws.

507
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,419
Every 30 feet, he barks and goes ca-ca.

508
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,342
4,000?

509
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:44,052
All right, 3,000, including the leash
and two extra cans of ca-ca.

510
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,939
How about 1,500 for the entire ensemble
and all the ca-ca?

511
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,392
I've got to get this stuff off my hands.

512
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,126
That makes three attempts
on my life in two days.

513
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,928
I am lucky. I have only had one.

514
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,844
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

515
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,470
That makes us even.

516
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,472
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

517
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,521
I guess I was just too gung-ho.

518
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,473
Gung who?

519
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,479
It's an American expression.

520
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:38,860
It means... "All fired up,"
full of spirit and determination.

521
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,784
Do you know what this opportunity
means to me?

522
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,407
I'm a third-generation police officer.

523
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,989
My grandfather and my father
were captains.

524
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,079
Your family must be very proud of you.

525
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,001
They still can't believe it.

526
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,454
Neither can I.

527
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,540
Me, out of all those millions.

528
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,380
My grandfather tells everyone
it's a practical joke.

529
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,804
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

530
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,677
This is my chance.

531
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,350
If I succeed,
then I've proved once and for all

532
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,144
that I'm a credit to the force,
that I'm a Sleigh.

533
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,645
Well, credit to the force,
where do you go from here?

534
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,101
Well, since Inspector Clouseau disappeared

535
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,403
while investigating
the theft of the Pink Panther,

536
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,572
I thought I'd visit the scene of the crime.

537
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,275
- Then you're off to Lugash?
- I leave on the next plane.

538
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,237
You leave? Good. I mean, good luck.

539
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,164
Thank you.

540
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,253
You know, I just want to tell you
how grateful I am...

541
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,647
What time does he arrive?

542
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,101
The 1:30 plane from Paris.

543
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:02,447
You realize what happens
if he finds that cursed diamond?

544
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,321
You'll have to return the money
to the insurance company.

545
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,777
And I've already spent it.

546
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,533
What's the alternative?

547
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,366
Make sure he doesn't find the diamond.

548
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,844
Well, obviously the first thing to do
is to figure out how the thief got in.

549
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,438
I don't think we've got
a thing to worry about.

550
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,486
That's what they thought about Clouseau.

551
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:45,111
He suspects Sir Charles Litton,
the notorious Phantom.

552
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,785
He's booked the evening flight
for the south of France.

553
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:53,411
The south of France
should be beautiful this time of year.

554
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,665
Unless you happen to
fall off the Grande Corniche.

555
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,770
I just had word that
he's arrived in the south of France.

556
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,767
When he left Nice airport,

557
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,897
he was followed by two members
of the Lugash secret police.

558
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,899
It appears that President Haleesh

559
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,198
would rather have the insurance money
than the diamond.

560
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:32,367
When you take into account that the mob
has already tried to kill him three times

561
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,290
to stop him from finding
Inspector Clouseau...

562
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,958
Chief Inspector.

563
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,878
I don't think that we've got
anything to worry about.

564
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:45,175
Still, all things considered,
I'm glad you had the surgery.

565
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,671
Even though you're
temporarily incapacitated,

566
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:52,724
in the long run, I'm sure
it will be more than worth the time.

567
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,411
Sure, pal.

568
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,116
Tell him he's here.

569
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,288
He's here.

570
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,491
- Sergeant Sleigh.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,577
Let me introduce you
to my nephew George.

572
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,751
- George.
- How do you do?

573
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,046
- Hugo, chair.
- Mr. Chair.

574
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,748
And my wife.

575
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,674
Hello. How do you do?

576
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,262
Hello.

577
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,683
So... You're investigating
the Clouseau case.

578
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,759
Yes.

579
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,642
- Allow me, sir.
- Thank you.

580
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,272
You wouldn't by any chance be related?

581
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,776
To Inspector Clouseau? No, but...

582
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,617
But it's funny you should ask me that.

583
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,070
The president of Lugash
asked me the same thing.

584
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,325
Really?

585
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,286
What about a drink, Sergeant?

586
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,039
Oh, no, thank you.

587
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,837
Darling, the Sergeant's on duty.

588
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,255
It's not that.

589
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,421
Then what about a nice cup of tea?

590
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,343
Actually, it's a lot better
for you than coffee.

591
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,592
It's got about
half the amount of caffeine in it.

592
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:58,892
I'm sure that's true, but I'd simply die
without my morning cup of coffee.

593
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,561
Anyway, what were you saying, Sergeant?

594
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,393
I...

595
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:09,227
You were saying about the investigation
of Inspector Clouseau.

596
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,311
Yes.

597
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,281
Allow me, sir.

598
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,972
You wanted to know
if Clouseau questioned me

599
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,053
about the theft of the Pink Panther.

600
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,309
- Yes.
- Yes.

601
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:46,940
He questioned me.

602
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,142
He did?

603
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,319
Oh, yes. He questioned me
three days after the robbery,

604
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,864
on the third of August,
to be precise, at 1:15.

605
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,282
He stayed for lunch.

606
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,575
And fell in the pool.

607
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,243
But why in the world would he think

608
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,993
that you would know anything
about the theft of the Pink Panther?

609
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,869
Oh, come on, George.

610
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,043
I mean, I'm sure the sergeant
is totally up-to-date

611
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,916
on my somewhat checkered career.

612
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,996
Right, Sergeant?

613
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:15,131
I mean, after all,
a man who for almost 30 years

614
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,555
has been thought to be
the notorious Phantom,

615
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,883
the cleverest jewel thief in all of Europe.

616
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,890
But Uncle Charles, it was never proven
that you were the Phantom.

617
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,848
No, nor that you took over where I left off.

618
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:31,026
But, George, you can understand
why he was suspicious

619
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,898
and why he wanted to question me.

620
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,354
Oh, sure.

621
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,691
And then, when he was satisfied
that I was completely innocent

622
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,744
and couldn't possibly have had
anything to do with it...

623
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,788
Because we were in Barbados
with George at the time of the robbery.

624
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,458
...then Inspector Clouseau
took off for Valencia.

625
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,752
Valencia?

626
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:54,466
Well, that leaves me
with just one question.

627
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,054
You said Valencia?

628
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,555
It's in Spain.

629
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,979
That Valencia!

630
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,558
Thank you very much.

631
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,109
Good-bye.

632
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,778
- Good-bye.
- Sir Charles.

633
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,313
Lady Litton.

634
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,243
He fell in the pool!

635
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,369
You're kidding.

636
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,054
You're sure you don't want
a bathrobe or something?

637
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,097
Oh, no. I've been enough trouble.

638
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,597
It's a warm day.
I can dry off on my way to Spain.

639
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,519
Well, good-bye, Sergeant.

640
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,938
Good-bye.

641
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,856
- Bye-bye, Sergeant.
- Bye-bye.

642
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,653
What do you think he'll find in Valencia?

643
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:08,115
Not very much,
unless he gets his glasses fixed.

644
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,046
Take me to the nearest hotel.

645
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,383
I thought you spoke English.

646
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,358
Check.

647
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,236
Don't get too close.

648
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,702
That's him.

649
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,266
Holy merde!

650
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,567
I'm allez-ing as fast as I can, man!

651
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,649
You said you didn't speak any English!

652
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,530
Don't you know that French cab drivers
are notoriously unreliable?

653
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,327
You sound like an American to me.

654
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,780
Pick, pick, pick.

655
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,869
Damn! Who the hell's trying to kill you?

656
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,454
I don't know!

657
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,215
Maybe they're trying to kill me!
Who do I know that wants to kill me?

658
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,721
No, it couldn't be my wife.
She doesn't drive.

659
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,894
Well, whoever it is,
you've got to try and lose 'em!

660
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,314
When somebody's shooting at you,
you gotta do better than try!

661
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,680
Come on, come on, come on...

662
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,012
Yes.

663
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,266
Something to eat?

664
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,350
No.

665
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,853
Beer, please.

666
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,735
Deux beers, s'il vous plaît.

667
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,039
Lovely here, isn't it?

668
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,814
It's a filthy habit.

669
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,644
Another?

670
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,347
No. Let's go.

671
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,442
Let's go, Shirley. Come on.

672
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,492
No, I can't.

673
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,241
Come on. Let's go.

674
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,456
Say good-bye.

675
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:34,879
Bye-bye.

676
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,721
What? You want to get a room here?

677
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,173
You do?

678
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,378
- I speak English.
- Good. Do you have a room?

679
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,204
For how many persons?

680
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,632
Just me and the little woman.

681
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,881
How long are you planning to stay?

682
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,429
Just... One night.

683
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,843
200 francs. Checkout time is 10:00 a.m.

684
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,559
Told you not to mix your drinks.

685
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,152
The bridal suite.

686
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:44,191
- Do we have a bridal suite?
- We have now.

687
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,614
Have a pleasant stay...

688
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,616
Mr. Smith.

689
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,042
Thank you.

690
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,130
Shirley! I'm sorry.

691
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,561
Yes, this is Monsieur Smith.

692
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,019
I would like to make a call to Paris.
St. Mary's Hospital.

693
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,441
- Paris?
- Yes.

694
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,860
- St. Mary's Hospital.
- Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

695
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,064
- Chief Inspector Dreyfus.
- And it's important!

696
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,111
Oui, Monsieur Smith.

697
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,409
- Hurry!
- Right away.

698
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,278
Excuse me.

699
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,624
I'm interested in Monsieur Smith.

700
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:03,787
Yes?

701
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,498
Hello, this is Sergeant Sleigh.

702
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:09,427
Oh, yes. Where the devil are you?

703
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,004
I don't know the name of the hotel...

704
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,215
But somebody's following me.

705
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:17,143
They tried to shoot me on the way to Nice.

706
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:21,105
Oh, my God. Hold on, I'll be right with you.

707
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,748
Hold on a sec. I've got to put the cork in.

708
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,795
What cork?

709
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,499
What do you mean? Hello?

710
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,880
Hello? Are you there?

711
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,177
Hello!

712
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,808
Why don't you answer?

713
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,097
I'm sorry, but things are
getting a little out of hand.

714
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,727
Now, where were we?

715
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,150
Yes, the location of the hotel.

716
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,611
Well, it's in the...

717
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,447
South of France...

718
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,991
And it's on a small street...

719
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,873
Look, I don't know what the point of this is,

720
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,246
because even if I knew where I was,

721
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,248
you're there, and I'm...

722
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,173
- I'm dizzy.
- Dizzy?

723
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,842
- I'm really dizzy.
- Why are you dizzy?

724
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,300
Must be the gas.

725
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:39,304
Gas? Why don't you open the window?

726
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,135
That's a good idea.

727
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,728
That's better.

728
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,574
Hello?

729
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,245
Are you there?

730
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:08,329
The explosion severely
traumatized your left eardrum,

731
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,791
but if you are careful
and avoid all loud noises,

732
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,923
partial hearing should be
restored in a few days.

733
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,424
What about the ringing?

734
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,881
I'm afraid that might take longer.

735
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,184
It's very loud.
I keep wanting to answer the telephone.

736
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,729
Just take the medicine I prescribe
and plenty of rest.

737
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,807
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

738
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,186
What if I can't distinguish the difference

739
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,693
between the ringing in my ear
and the phone?

740
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,148
That could be a problem.

741
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,232
What?

742
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,693
It may not last much longer.

743
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,744
I couldn't stand it if it did.

744
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:43,990
Where is Sleigh?

745
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,995
On his way to Valencia.

746
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,166
Valencia?

747
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,540
A tip, from Sir Charles.

748
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,918
There! It's getting worse!

749
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,644
He just checked in.

750
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,314
Very convenient. Right down the hall. 311.

751
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,229
Not in the hotel.

752
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,732
When he goes out tonight,
all those fireworks out there,

753
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,437
nobody's gonna notice a little shooting.

754
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:16,773
We can't miss.

755
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:20,325
Yeah. But just to make sure,
I've hired a backup.

756
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,035
Mr. Chong.

757
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,408
Who the hell is Mr. Chong?

758
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,910
He's a ninja,

759
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,959
the most powerful human
killing machine in the world.

760
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:35,170
Visualize energy as a gathering storm.

761
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,134
It flows to the hand.

762
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:42,802
The hand consigns it to the primary object.

763
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:47,265
As the primary object is destroyed,

764
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:50,894
it is consigned to the secondary object,

765
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,646
and so on...

766
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,149
Like an atomic chain reaction.

767
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,564
I will demonstrate.

768
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,312
We have a problem.

769
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,739
Sergeant Sleigh has arrived in Valencia.

770
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,925
I understand.

771
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,003
One moment.

772
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,715
Sergeant Sleigh wishes to speak with you.

773
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,798
He's here?

774
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:08,384
No, he's on the other line.

775
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,470
Tell him I'll be right with him.

776
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,897
Listen, he's just called.
I've got him holding on the other line.

777
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,895
- Not a word!
- Of course.

778
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,862
Hello.

779
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,985
Chief Vigila here.
What can I do for you, Sergeant?

780
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:26,695
I'm investigating
the disappearance of Inspector Clouseau.

781
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,111
What?

782
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:31,449
Wait a minute. I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I'm gonna close the window.

783
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,828
What?

784
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,751
I'm going to close the window.

785
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,827
What?

786
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,080
What are you talking about?

787
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,060
Okay, I closed it.

788
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,763
Thank you for your cooperation.
I'll be right over.

789
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,309
Will you hold him, please?

790
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:28,069
You should be ashamed of yourself,
young man.

791
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,185
Where's the police station?

792
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,012
Over there, by the palazzo.

793
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,438
Thank you!

794
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,694
Don't lose him!

795
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,068
Go around that way!

796
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:10,653
Come on!

797
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,185
Hi.

798
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,015
Hi. Hey, you're the girl from the elevator.

799
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,690
Yeah.

800
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,689
What are you doing?

801
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,188
Nothing.

802
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,897
Is anything the matter?

803
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,199
Look, you're not gonna believe this,

804
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,992
but some men are trying to kill me.

805
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,536
- You're right.
- I am?

806
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,033
I'm not gonna believe you.

807
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,740
No, seriously.
They were just shooting at me outside.

808
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,373
- Look, are you alone?
- Yes.

809
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,125
- Have you got a table?
- Yes.

810
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,002
Would you mind being
my Instant Companion?

811
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:32,503
Your instant what?

812
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,301
Look, normally I wouldn't impose,
but my other one blew up.

813
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,135
I'll explain everything to you on the way.
Where's your table?

814
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,986
- Do you see them?
- No.

815
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,577
Well, if you see them, kiss me.

816
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,070
Kiss you?

817
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,076
Well, they're not looking for a couple.

818
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,167
That's the Instant Companion theory.

819
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,835
Do you know Professor Balls?

820
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:09,911
Who?

821
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,379
Professor Balls.

822
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,334
- Do you see them?
- One of 'em.

823
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,261
- Where?
- Over by the door.

824
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,926
Don't see him now.

825
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,725
Strange. He's gone.

826
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,569
Are you sure you saw them?

827
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,112
Of course. That's why I kissed you.

828
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:37,777
Of course.

829
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,987
Wait a minute.

830
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,445
You don't think I pretended
to see that guy just so I could kiss you!

831
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,452
The thought did occur to me.

832
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,831
There he is again!

833
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:59,010
- Do you see him?
- He's gone.

834
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:04,891
I don't believe it.

835
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,139
I saw him both times.

836
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,143
You don't believe me, do you?

837
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,981
Does it matter?

838
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,984
Well, whether you saw the man or not,

839
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,610
I quite enjoyed it.

840
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,067
- You did?
- Didn't you?

841
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,117
Well, now that you mention it, I guess I did.

842
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:27,448
Well?

843
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,993
Think I see him again.

844
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:33,536
Good.

845
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,465
See what I mean?

846
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,514
I certainly do.

847
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,972
I'm kissing you,
and I don't even know your name.

848
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:55,980
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
You're kissing a dead duck.

849
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,090
Garbage!

850
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,858
Look, she doesn't have
anything to do with this.

851
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:45,942
That's a shame.

852
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,322
Excuse me.

853
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,245
Listen, I still don't know your name.

854
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,321
Clifton.

855
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,538
Catch me, I'm gonna faint.

856
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,163
I'm coming!

857
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,415
I'm going!

858
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:15,707
Don't worry about a thing.
I've got these guys just where I want 'em.

859
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:16,909
Look out!

860
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,332
Oh, no!

861
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,165
Now I'm mad!

862
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,381
Now I'm hurt!

863
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,371
Sweetheart, are you all right?

864
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,673
Come on, let's get out of here.

865
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,422
Clifton!

866
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,386
Oh, boy.

867
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,799
Oh, no!

868
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,371
Wait. This way.

869
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,703
- Why?
- I have to see the chief of police.

870
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,413
- No!
- Why not?

871
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:09,793
I can't explain.

872
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:15,800
Good-bye, Clifton.

873
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:56,377
Hello?

874
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:57,963
He hasn't shown up yet.

875
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,139
He just went into the hotel.

876
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,057
I'll be there. Ten minutes.

877
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,134
Good.

878
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:35,041
Yes, this is Sergeant Sleigh in Room 311.

879
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,798
Can you tell me the name of
the young lady in Room 310?

880
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,548
- Juleta Shane.
- Thank you very much.

881
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,305
I knocked on your door.

882
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,515
I told the bellboy I was your sister.

883
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:53,067
I don't think he believed me.

884
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,106
Did I wake you?

885
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,730
No, why?

886
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,656
Well, you're wearing my pajamas.

887
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:02,739
Only the top.

888
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,123
Does it bother you?

889
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:08,783
No.

890
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,923
I charged the champagne to your room.
I hope you don't mind.

891
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,921
I don't mind at all.

892
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:27,769
Here's to the rest of the night
with an option on tomorrow.

893
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,735
I can't stay.

894
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,404
See, I had a very important meeting
with the chief of police...

895
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,870
I couldn't let you just run off like that.
I had to find you.

896
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:50,371
But... Now that I have found you,
I have to keep that meeting.

897
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:52,828
I'm a...

898
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:57,382
I'm a police officer.

899
01:24:58,427 --> 01:24:59,713
Police.

900
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,967
And I'm working on a case,

901
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,890
a very important case,

902
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:09,265
and I think I'm getting close to the answer.

903
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,346
I think that's why those men were...

904
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,978
Were trying to kill me tonight.

905
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:18,027
By the way, where did you
learn to fight like that?

906
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:22,153
I was raised in the East End of London,

907
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:26,202
where you had to learn how to fight
if you wanted to keep your integrity.

908
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:31,370
I'll be back as soon as I can.

909
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:33,201
I won't be here.

910
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:34,995
Why not?

911
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,621
Because I won't.

912
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:40,959
I'm touchy about throwing myself
at a man and then being rejected.

913
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:42,760
But I'm not rejecting you.

914
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,803
- Then stay.
- I can't.

915
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,131
But I want you.

916
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,510
Oh, God.

917
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:48,967
Now.

918
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:52,270
Couldn't you just hold out for
maybe half an hour?

919
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:53,312
No.

920
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:54,980
Twenty-five minutes. I'll run.

921
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,308
I can't wait.

922
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,984
But you don't understand.
This is my big chance.

923
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,187
Don't blow it.

924
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,069
No, I mean to prove once and for all
that I'm a good cop.

925
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,242
And I want you to prove it too.

926
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,237
I mean, to my family...

927
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:13,913
To Lieutenant Palmyra
and the 28th Precinct...

928
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,585
My goofy grandfather
and his rolled-up newspaper,

929
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:20,916
and my father's medals,

930
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:25,470
and his citation from the governor
for bravery.

931
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:27,512
You don't understand.

932
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,683
Oh, my God, I sound like Stan Laurel.

933
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,307
I've got to go.

934
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,644
I hope you're here when I get back.

935
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:48,947
What?

936
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,448
Here's to being here when you get back.

937
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,164
I'll drink to that.

938
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:15,143
What's wrong? Juleta?

939
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:19,474
Oh, my God.

940
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:31,361
Get a doctor! It's an emergency!

941
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:34,289
Room 311. And send the police!

942
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,156
Probably a powerful tranquilizer.

943
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:12,110
She'll recover,
but she'll be unconscious for hours.

944
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,615
I recognize her.

945
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,992
She's the Countess Chandra's
personal secretary.

946
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,289
Her name's Juleta Shane.

947
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,957
Her name is Julie Morgan.

948
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,785
She has been with the Countess
for seven years.

949
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:24,338
- Who's this Countess...
- I ask the questions, señor Sleigh.

950
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:25,790
Sergeant Sleigh.

951
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,046
Is that "Slay," as in "kill"?

952
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,844
No, it's "Sleigh," as in "one-horse open."

953
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:32,964
Why did you shoot her?

954
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:36,517
I didn't. I'm a New York City
police officer working with the Sûreté.

955
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,515
Yes, investigating the Clouseau case.

956
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,267
Yes, they said you would say this.

957
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,974
- You have my identification.
- Excellent forgeries.

958
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,980
Look, I can clear this up
with one phone call.

959
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,902
After you have answered some questions.

960
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,980
I've told you everything.

961
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,440
Bring him along.

962
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,120
What kind of tranquilizer is it?

963
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:58,323
I don't know.

964
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,406
Come on.

965
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:11,627
Get out of the way!

966
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,678
Hey, come on! Move, move!

967
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:16,382
I'm a police officer! I'm a police officer!

968
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,433
Hey, come on! Move! Move it!

969
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,112
Hey, what are you doing?

970
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,572
After him! After him!

971
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,823
Move!

972
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:16,613
Fool, you've lost him! This way!

973
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,657
Good evening, Sergeant.

974
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,951
Hello, Mr. Litton.

975
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,661
Can I give you a lift?

976
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,580
As a matter of fact, yes.

977
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:30,960
Hop in.

978
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,824
Good morning, George.

979
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,081
Look what I found.

980
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:06,951
Sergeant, you're up early.

981
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:08,707
I haven't been to bed yet.

982
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,462
Come aboard.

983
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:20,969
Well. You look like
you need some breakfast.

984
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:24,393
Have a little pineapple or something.
Darling, you remember Sergeant Sleigh.

985
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:25,811
Of course I do.

986
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,388
- Hello, do sit down.
- Thank you.

987
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,474
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

988
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:30,523
- I'll get that.
- Thank you.

989
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,943
Obviously, those are not your handcuffs,
so you don't have a key.

990
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:34,816
Darling, may I borrow your manicure set?

991
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:36,568
- Oh, yes, darling.
- Thank you so much.

992
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,069
I'll time you on that, Uncle Charles.

993
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,491
All right. This should do it.

994
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,068
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

995
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:45,452
I feel I owe you an explanation.

996
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,706
You see, there was this young lady
who said her name was Juleta Shane.

997
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,536
Juleta. What a pretty name.

998
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,792
Yes, but her real name was Julie Morgan.

999
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:55,966
- I know a Julie Morgan.
- Didn't she work for Countess Chandra?

1000
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,042
Yes.

1001
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,173
Twelve seconds, Uncle Charles.

1002
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,677
Oh, stop, George. That's not fair.
You're rushing him.

1003
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,382
Yes. Don't rattle me, George.

1004
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:05,346
Anyway, somebody shot her.

1005
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:06,427
No.

1006
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,353
- With a dart.
- With a dart?

1007
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,022
- A tranquilizer.
- Imagine.

1008
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:11,599
Oh, my God, it's beyond me.

1009
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:14,686
Yes. It was somebody
in one of those big heads.

1010
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,769
Big heads?

1011
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,526
Yes, they had an air gun,

1012
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,857
and just as we were about to
drink some champagne...

1013
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,692
Pop! Right in the back of the neck.

1014
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:23,368
- Right.
- There we are.

1015
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,868
28 seconds, Uncle Charles.
You're getting a little rusty.

1016
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:28,540
Well, all right, George.
You try the other one.

1017
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,367
- All right.
- I'll time you.

1018
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,499
- Terrific.
- Ready? Go.

1019
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:37,215
I really appreciate this.

1020
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,253
And you're not aiding
and abetting a criminal.

1021
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,507
Thank God for that.

1022
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:43,931
- You see, I was falsely accused.
- Of course.

1023
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:46,930
And now it's imperative
I find this Countess Chandra.

1024
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:50,350
Didn't she own an exclusive
health spa in Majorca?

1025
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,272
- Still does.
- Ten seconds, George.

1026
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:53,644
Don't rattle me.

1027
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:57,191
Majorca. I've got to get to Majorca.

1028
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,237
We're going there, on our way.

1029
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:01,532
And we'll be very happy to give you a lift.

1030
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:02,859
- Really?
- Yes.

1031
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,194
- Gosh, that's terrific!
- I go there every year.

1032
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:08,656
Charles won't try it. He was
in the infantry... You know, all that mud.

1033
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:09,740
Mud?

1034
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,575
Well, how'd I do?

1035
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:14,753
Not bad. I just beat you.
Sure you won't have a pineapple?

1036
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,330
Okay.

1037
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,760
Thank you, Countess. I'm very grateful.

1038
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,337
It's been my pleasure.

1039
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,344
We have a problem.

1040
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:31,849
Julie's in the hospital.

1041
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:36,650
The man who Chief Vigila says shot her
with the tranquilizing dart has escaped.

1042
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:40,355
Chief Vigila claims the man
was impersonating Sergeant Sleigh.

1043
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,065
Doesn't make sense.
Julie knew what Sleigh looked like.

1044
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:45,697
Sometimes it is possible
to look like one person,

1045
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,528
but actually be another.

1046
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:50,781
My God!

1047
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:52,954
It's fantastic!

1048
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:54,710
Oh, darling!

1049
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,627
Don't kiss him too hard.
His lips might fall off.

1050
01:33:58,716 --> 01:33:59,672
What?

1051
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,842
Just a little surgical humor.

1052
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,216
Here, have a look.

1053
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,555
Happy?

1054
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:20,402
Is that the Litton yacht?

1055
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:32,995
You can't see the spa from here.
It's about a quarter of a mile inland.

1056
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,076
Sure would like to case the layout.

1057
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,832
That won't be easy.

1058
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,710
Have you tried that?

1059
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,917
No. It looks like fun.

1060
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:27,219
No, looks like suicide.

1061
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:06,751
Oh, no!

1062
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:24,272
Are you all right?

1063
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:28,022
Yes. Yes, I think I am, thank you.

1064
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:29,482
I'm Countess Chandra.

1065
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:31,066
Sergeant Sleigh.

1066
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:35,447
- Lucky you landed in the mud.
- Yes. It's hot mud.

1067
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,406
Volcanic. It's good for the skin.

1068
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,287
Doesn't do much for the clothes, I'm afraid.

1069
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,664
- Would you like to rinse off?
- Yes, I think I would.

1070
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:42,744
This way.

1071
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,548
Straight ahead. To your left.

1072
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:47,624
Big step.

1073
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,047
I'll get you a towel.

1074
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:58,056
I'm investigating
the disappearance of Inspector Clouseau.

1075
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,978
You just missed Chief Vigila.

1076
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:01,600
He says you're an imposter.

1077
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:04,399
Oh, he does, does he? Well, I'm not.

1078
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:06,647
And I want some answers.

1079
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:14,322
Julie Morgan, also known as
Juleta Shane, knows who I am.

1080
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,529
I'm so glad Julie's going to be all right.

1081
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:19,114
How bizarre! A tranquilizing dart!

1082
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,040
Who do you think shot her?

1083
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:22,789
I thought you might know.

1084
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,916
- Why me?
- She works for you.

1085
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,497
Lots of people work for me.

1086
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:28,878
What Julie does in her own time
is her own business.

1087
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:33,837
My God.

1088
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,763
Yes... I know that.

1089
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,057
You!

1090
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:39,760
Yes, it is me.

1091
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:44,648
I'm just checking the bar
for the bar fleas, you know.

1092
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:48,443
Swine step!

1093
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:52,530
You really should do something
about your architect,

1094
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:53,903
you know, my darling.

1095
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,157
- Darling?
- Yes, my darling?

1096
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,957
You're smoking the wrong end.

1097
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:06,328
Yes, I know that.

1098
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:09,881
You don't have to tell me
I'm smoking the wrong end.

1099
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:12,380
Do you know why
I am smoking the wrong end?

1100
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:14,962
No, darling, but I'm sure
you've got a very good reason.

1101
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:16,172
Right.

1102
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:20,726
I am smoking the wrong end
because I have a very good reason.

1103
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,265
Are you all right?

1104
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:32,189
Yes, of course I'm all right.
I'm examining the roof.

1105
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:34,068
Can I give you a hand?

1106
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:35,148
Thank you.

1107
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,277
Obviously you are not a smoker.

1108
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:39,703
I'm sorry.

1109
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:52,375
Do you realize you are
wearing my ice bucket?

1110
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:54,755
I'm sorry. It's stuck.

1111
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:57,805
Yes, well, that is no problem.
I am an expert in these matters.

1112
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:58,971
Bend down.

1113
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:00,928
Bend over.

1114
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:07,435
Here, let me help.

1115
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:10,108
Yes, it is a question of leverage.

1116
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:31,379
Yes, that is better.

1117
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:34,591
It goes with the suit, you know.

1118
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:38,549
Oh, by the way, we have not
been properly introduced.

1119
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:40,638
You of course know who I am?

1120
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,011
Sergeant Sleigh.

1121
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:44,184
No, I am not Sergeant Sleigh.

1122
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:45,681
No, I am Sergeant Sleigh.

1123
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:48,855
Oh, yes. Now we are getting somewhere.

1124
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,934
- Shall we all have a drink?
- An excellent idea.

1125
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:53,735
I will have my usual.

1126
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,697
A Kahlúa and root beer.

1127
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,987
I'll just have the root beer.

1128
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:02,073
You do not know what you are missing.

1129
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:05,907
It is a combination
that makes a real thirst-quencher.

1130
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,582
I'm a teetotaler.

1131
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:12,292
You total the tea.
I thought you were a police sergeant.

1132
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:16,546
I am. Before I left New York,
I read you were making another movie.

1133
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:18,343
He had two weeks off.

1134
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:21,843
Yes, I have two weeks off, you know,

1135
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:26,394
and when I have the time,
I come here to take the waters.

1136
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:27,811
Very cleansing.

1137
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,430
I enjoy a good cleanse.

1138
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:32,232
I'm afraid there's no more ice.

1139
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:33,308
That's okay.

1140
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:36,065
Well, here's to
your investigation, Sergeant.

1141
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:37,396
To Inspector Clouseau.

1142
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:38,901
Chief Inspector.

1143
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:45,783
That felt good.

1144
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:49,533
Have you ever seen this man before?

1145
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:52,745
No, I have never seen this man
before in my life. Never.

1146
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:55,706
- It's Inspector Clouseau.
- Chief Inspector.

1147
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,213
- That's Inspector Clouseau?
- Chief Inspector!

1148
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,383
Do you know him?

1149
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,586
- Yes!
- What?

1150
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:03,514
Well, he came here about a year ago,
but he said his name was Gino Rossi.

1151
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,807
He wanted the name
of a good plastic surgeon,

1152
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,761
so I recommended
Dr. Prosper Stang, of Madrid.

1153
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:11,304
Well...

1154
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,440
Guess that just about does it.

1155
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:14,516
It does?

1156
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,819
Yes. There is one more thing, though.

1157
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:20,985
Could I have your autograph?

1158
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,442
It's for my grandfather.

1159
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:27,579
- Hello, oui.
- Hello, François.

1160
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:28,781
Oh, it's you!

1161
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:31,499
Good afternoon. Where are you?

1162
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,669
I am in agony.

1163
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:37,581
I want you to arrange for a hospital plane

1164
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:40,292
to carry me back to Paris immediately!

1165
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:43,094
And ask my psychiatrist

1166
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:47,015
if he can see me five days a week,
twice a day!

1167
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:51,307
Have you heard from Sergeant Sleigh?

1168
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:55,016
He called about five minutes ago
from a health spa.

1169
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:56,145
Health spa?

1170
01:41:56,235 --> 01:42:00,354
Oui. He asked me to check on
a man named Gino Rossi,

1171
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:03,111
then he said he was leaving for Madrid,

1172
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,910
to question a plastic surgeon named Stang.

1173
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:09,363
Yes, well, good-bye, Sergeant,

1174
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,915
and don't be a stranger, huh?

1175
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,543
- Thank you.
- See you at the movies, huh?

1176
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:15,619
Yes.

1177
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:17,621
Cheerio.

1178
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:34,062
Did that swine architect of yours
move that door by any chance?

1179
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:38,642
There goes the last of our problems.

1180
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:40,227
- Yes.
- Come on.

1181
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,562
Where are we going?

1182
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,319
Let's celebrate.
I haven't seen it for such a long time.

1183
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:46,650
Well, I have not been too well, you know?

1184
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,657
Not that! The Pink Panther!

1185
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:51,454
I was just checking.

1186
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:54,575
Oh, my God!

1187
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,212
It's gone!

1188
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:05,923
Swine Phantom!

1189
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:08,505
I interrogated Dr. Stang,

1190
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:11,262
who admitted that he had operated
on Clouseau's face.

1191
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,183
This is what he looked like
after the operation.

1192
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:19,858
He stole the Pink Panther,
had his face changed,

1193
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:22,027
and then called himself Gino Rossi.

1194
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,854
And you are sure he's dead?

1195
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:25,780
- Well, according to...
- The Valencia...

1196
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:27,273
Go ahead.

1197
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:29,030
- You wanted to say something?
- No, no. After you.

1198
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,611
- You're sure?
- Yes, please.

1199
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:33,871
All I wanted to say is that
the Valencia police

1200
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:35,915
identified the man in the photograph

1201
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:38,334
as a John Doe who had been shot,

1202
01:43:38,421 --> 01:43:41,505
and whose corpse was found
washed up on the beach.

1203
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,877
Obviously killed for the diamond.

1204
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:44,958
Obviously.

1205
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:48,295
Should we have the body exhumed,
just to make sure?

1206
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:49,379
No.

1207
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:53,096
I have compared Clouseau's fingerprints
with those of the dead man,

1208
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:55,723
and they are identical.

1209
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:58,897
Oh, yes. There is no doubt
that Clouseau is dead.

1210
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:00,815
A good cop gone bad.

1211
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:02,517
Yes, well...

1212
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:06,195
You've certainly proved
that you are a good cop, Sergeant,

1213
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:07,648
a credit to the profession.

1214
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,200
On behalf of the President
and the people of France,

1215
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:11,822
I congratulate you. Good-bye.

1216
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:13,153
Thank you, sir.

1217
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,197
Good-bye.

1218
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:34,759
Good-bye, Mr. Rossi,
alias Chief Inspector Clouseau.

1219
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:04,250
Peace at last!

1220
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:11,336
Well, bon voyage, Sergeant. Well done.

1221
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:13,467
- You should come again sometime.
- Thank you.

1222
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:15,674
Help! Help!

1223
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,260
I'm burning! Hurry up!

1224
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:20,265
Get the hose!

1225
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:21,688
The hose!

1226
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:22,764
There!

1227
01:45:24,777 --> 01:45:26,484
Hurry up! Pull!

1228
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:27,560
Help!

1229
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:32,399
Help! Hurry up!

1230
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:33,859
Hit the water!

1231
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,027
Help!

1232
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:50,291
Check.

1233
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:53,844
Mate!

1234
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:58,758
Beautiful.

1235
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:03,139
Do you recommend Countess Chandra's?

1236
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:07,397
Definitely. In fact, I'd love to
go back there and spend more time.

1237
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:11,571
By the way, I seem to be missing a glove.

1238
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:15,446
"Always leave something
for something," is my motto.

1239
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:16,617
What's yours?

1240
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:19,947
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

1241
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:24,246
I'll drink to that.
