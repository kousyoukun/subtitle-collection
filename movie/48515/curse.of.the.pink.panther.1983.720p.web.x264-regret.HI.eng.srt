good-bye, sergeant,

1618
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:12,693
and, uh, don't be
a stranger, huh?

1619
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:14,194
Ha. Thank you.

1620
01:42:14,228 --> 01:42:15,863
See you at the movies, huh?

1621
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:17,698
Yes.
[CHUCKLES]

1622
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:18,899
Cheerio.

1623
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:32,546
Did that swine
architect of yours

1624
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:35,749
move that door by any chance?

1625
01:42:37,351 --> 01:42:39,319
There goes the last
of our problems.

1626
01:42:39,353 --> 01:42:41,321
Yes.
Come on.

1627
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:42,322
Where are we going?

1628
01:42:42,356 --> 01:42:43,724
Let's celebrate.

1629
01:42:43,757 --> 01:42:44,591
I haven't seen it
for such a long time.

1630
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:47,060
Well, I've not been
too well, you know?

1631
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:50,230
Not that.
The Pink Panther.

1632
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:51,999
I was just checking.

1633
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:54,334
[GASPS]

1634
01:42:54,368 --> 01:42:55,536
Oh, my god!

1635
01:42:58,372 --> 01:42:59,773
It's gone!

1636
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:07,014
Swine Phantom!

1637
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:08,849
I interrogated
Dr. Stang,

1638
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:13,086
who admitted that he had
operated on Clouseau's face.

1639
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:16,590
This is what he looked
like after the operation.

1640
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:18,759
He stole The Pink Panther,

1641
01:43:18,792 --> 01:43:22,529
had his face changed, and then
called himself Gino Rossi.

1642
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:24,431
And you are sure he's dead?

1643
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:25,866
The Valencia…

1644
01:43:25,899 --> 01:43:27,768
According to the… go ahead.

1645
01:43:27,801 --> 01:43:28,936
You wanted to say something?

1646
01:43:28,969 --> 01:43:30,037
No, no. After you.

1647
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:31,605
You're sure?
Yes, please.

1648
01:43:31,638 --> 01:43:34,107
All I wanted to say is
that the Valencia police

1649
01:43:34,141 --> 01:43:37,377
identified the man in the
photograph as a John dough

1650
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:39,279
who had been shot

1651
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:42,049
and whose corpse was found
washed up on the beach.

1652
01:43:42,082 --> 01:43:44,451
Obviously killed
for the diamond.

1653
01:43:44,484 --> 01:43:45,953
Obviously.

1654
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:48,889
Should we have the body
exhumed just to make sure?

1655
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,457
Uh, no.

1656
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:52,459
Ahem. I have compared
Clouseau's fingerprints

1657
01:43:52,492 --> 01:43:54,294
with those of the dead man,

1658
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:56,396
and, uh, they are identical.

1659
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:59,466
Oh, yes. There is no doubt
that Clouseau is dead.

1660
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:01,568
A good cop gone bad.

1661
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:03,403
Yes, well…
[CHUCKLES]

1662
01:44:03,437 --> 01:44:05,138
You've certainly proved

1663
01:44:05,172 --> 01:44:07,407
that you are a good cop,
sergeant,

1664
01:44:07,441 --> 01:44:08,475
a credit to the profession.

1665
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:10,811
On behalf of the President
and the people of France,

1666
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:12,479
I congratulate you.
Good-bye.

1667
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:13,814
Thank you, sir.

1668
01:44:13,847 --> 01:44:15,949
[LAUGHS]
Good-bye.

1669
01:44:28,962 --> 01:44:31,164
Good-bye, Mr. Rossi,

1670
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,836
alias chief inspector Clouseau.

1671
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:37,871
[CHUCKLES]

1672
01:44:56,723 --> 01:44:57,824
Ahh.

1673
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:05,532
Peace at last!

1674
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:07,467
Ahh!

1675
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:08,869
[CHUCKLING]

1676
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:10,704
Well, bon voyage, sergeant.

1677
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:11,805
Well done.

1678
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:13,640
You should come again sometime.

1679
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:14,641
Thank you.

1680
01:45:14,675 --> 01:45:15,876
DREYFUS: Help! Help!

1681
01:45:15,909 --> 01:45:18,378
I'm burning! Hurry up!

1682
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:20,380
Get the hose!

1683
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:22,849
The… the hose!
There!

1684
01:45:25,085 --> 01:45:26,987
DREYFUS: Hurry up!

1685
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,588
Help!

1686
01:45:30,857 --> 01:45:32,726
Help! Hurry up!

1687
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:33,994
Hit the water!

1688
01:45:34,027 --> 01:45:38,065
Help! Oh, help!

1689
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:40,033
Aah!

1690
01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:43,937
Aah!

1691
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:51,445
Check.

1692
01:45:52,946 --> 01:45:54,948
Mate!

1693
01:45:56,783 --> 01:45:58,085
Ah.

1694
01:45:58,118 --> 01:45:59,753
Beautiful.

1695
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:02,856
Do you, um, recommend
Countess Chandra's?

1696
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:04,858
Definitely.

1697
01:46:04,891 --> 01:46:07,861
In fact, I'd love to go back
there and spend more time.

1698
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:11,765
By the way, I seem
to be missing a glove.

1699
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:15,769
Always leave something,
for something is my motive.

1700
01:46:15,802 --> 01:46:16,870
What's yours?

1701
01:46:16,903 --> 01:46:19,973
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

1702
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:24,478
I'll drink to that.
