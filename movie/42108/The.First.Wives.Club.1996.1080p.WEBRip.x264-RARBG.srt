00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,154
OR THE FULL
ENCHILADA?

351
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,356
I WORK OUT EVERY DAY.

352
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,757
I WATCH MY DIET.

353
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,093
I HAVE NOT HAD
PLASTIC SURGERY.

354
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,361
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

355
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,362
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.

356
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,297
OH, COME ON.

357
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,366
ELISE, YOU'RE LYING
THROUGH YOUR CAPS.

358
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,168
OK. ALL RIGHT.

359
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,237
I HAVE BEEN
FRESHENED UP
A LITTLE BIT.

360
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,172
OH, GOD.
DOES IT HURT?

361
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,506
MMM. NO.

362
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,142
WHAT DO THEY DO
WITH THE STUFF
THEY TAKE OFF?

363
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,776
DO YOU GET
TO KEEP IT?

364
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,245
OH, COME ON, BRENDA.

365
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,313
IT'S THE NINETIES,
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

366
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:03,383
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
PLASTIC SURGERY'S
LIKE GOOD GROOMING.

367
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,385
IT'S LIKE BRUSHING
YOUR TEETH.

368
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,520
ELISE, LOOK AT YOU.

369
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,789
YOU HAVE BEEN
YANKED AND STITCHED

370
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,291
AND STUFFED AND PULLED.

371
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,425
YOU'RE A TURKEY.

372
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,660
A WHAT?

373
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,595
AND TO PLEASE WHO?
YOUR EX-HUSBAND?

374
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,597
NO. TO PLEASE EVERYBODY.

375
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,232
TO PLEASE EVERYBODY.

376
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,467
Brenda: EVERYBODY.

377
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,668
MEN, WOMEN...

378
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,669
EVERYONE.

379
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,171
STUDIO EXECUTIVES.

380
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,573
I MEAN, COME ON. I MEAN,
YOUTH AND BEAUTY, MAN.

381
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,341
I MEAN, THAT'S THE TICKET.

382
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,576
WHEN MEN--

383
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,612
NO, WHEN WOMEN GET
TO BE A CERTAIN AGE...

384
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,214
BYE-BYE, LOVE.

385
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,149
HELLO, POP-TARTS.

386
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:40,320
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.
IT'S A HOLOCAUST.

387
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,755
OH, GOD, I WISH
I HAD THE COURAGE

388
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,325
NO.
TO JUST GIVE IT
ALL UP, YOU KNOW?

389
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,194
TO SAY WHO
GIVES A RAT'S ASS?

390
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:51,231
AND JUST LET MYSELF GO
LIKE YOU TWO.

391
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,567
OH, NO.
NO OFFENSE.

392
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,668
NONE TAKEN.

393
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,305
OH, SPEAK FOR
YOURSELF, OK?

394
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,607
ELISE, YOU'RE GIFTED.
YOU'RE TALENTED...

395
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,608
THANK YOU.

396
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,343
AND SUCCESSFUL,
AND BRENDA,

397
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,877
YOU'RE WONDERFULLY
VERBAL,

398
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:09,249
AND I AM SEEING A VERY
TALENTED THERAPIST.

399
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,218
NOW, WE'RE IN OUR PRIME,

400
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,952
AND BY THE WAY,

401
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,888
MY MARRIAGE IS JUST FINE,
THANK YOU.

402
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,324
ANNIE,

403
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,525
YOU...

404
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,694
HAVE AN AMAZING
ATTITUDE.

405
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:22,762
YOU, YOU--

406
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:23,896
WELL--

407
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,798
YOU ARE SO CHEERFUL.

408
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,234
WELL, WE--

409
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,768
YOU ARE GEN--
LOOK AT ME.

410
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,802
WHAT?

411
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,272
YOU ARE
GENUINELY HAPPY.

412
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,673
IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL THING.

413
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,808
WELL, THANK YOU.

414
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,612
LITHIUM?

415
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,553
Annie: YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN SO PROUD
OF ME, LESLIE.

416
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,922
I MEAN, I WAS THE
ONLY POSITIVE THING
AT THAT TABLE.

417
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,659
I MEAN, OF COURSE,
THERE ARE STILL TRACES

418
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,661
OF THE SAME WONDERFUL
WITTY WOMEN

419
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,429
I KNEW ALL
THOSE YEARS AGO,

420
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,231
BUT, AHH, I DON'T KNOW.

421
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,667
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
THEY ARE JUST SO...

422
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,402
ANGRY, AND
THEY'RE SO CONFUSED.

423
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,804
I MEAN,
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG,
WE HAD SUCH SPIRIT.

424
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:05,805
SAY IT, ANNIE.

425
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,806
HUH? WHAT?

426
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,441
WORK FROM LOVE.

427
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,543
OK.

428
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,644
WORK FROM LOVE.

429
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,645
GOOD.

430
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,247
GROW FROM LOVE.

431
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,516
GROW FROM LOVE.

432
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,817
SCREW THE WORLD.

433
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,819
I CAN'T SAY THAT.
I'M SORRY, LESLIE.

434
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,454
HEY, ANNIE.
UH, WHAT?

435
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,956
ANNIE, YOU ARE
STILL DOING IT.
I KNOW.

436
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,958
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH UNEXPRESSED ANGER.

437
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,794
WELL, I KNOW.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

438
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,496
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY MOT--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

439
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,897
IT'S MY MOTHER.
IT'S CONNECTICUT.

440
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,366
IT'S ALL THESE
LOUD NOISES.
AND AARON?

441
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,701
NO, I KNOW
WE'RE SEPARATED,

442
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,303
BUT I THINK THIS
IS JUST REALLY--

443
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,571
IT'S LIKE
A REST PERIOD, LESLIE.

444
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,573
WE'RE JUST KIND OF
GETTING--AAH! OHH.

445
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,409
DO IT, ANNIE.
GET ANGRY.

446
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,744
I COULDN'T. I KNOW
THAT I SHOULD, LESLIE.
I REALLY DO.

447
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,878
IT'S JUST THAT--
HIT ME.

448
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,880
STAND UP, ANNIE,
AND HIT ME.

449
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,482
NO. I--
I CAN'T, LESLIE.

450
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,017
I'M SO SORRY.
COME ON.

451
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,485
IT'S JUST--YOU KNOW,

452
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,853
MAYBE--I KNOW WHAT.
MAYBE NEXT WEEK.

453
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,856
ANNIE, LET IT OUT.
I WANT YOU TO HIT ME.

454
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,825
TRUST ME. COME ON.
IT'S OK.

455
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,927
O-OK.

456
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,699
OH. RAMBO.

457
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,001
OOH. A REAL
TOUGH GUY.

458
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:12,004
COME ON, ANNIE,
HIT ME.

459
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,607
I LOVE THAT.

460
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,310
OOH. OOH. WHOO.

461
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,611
OH. OH, MY GOD.

462
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,612
THAT WAS BETTER.

463
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:20,813
I'M SO SORRY.

464
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,382
OH, PLEASE
DON'T TELL AARON.

465
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,383
[BUZZER]

466
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,384
TIME'S UP.

467
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,618
I'M SO SORRY.

468
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,019
TIME TO GO.
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

469
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:28,555
THANK YOU.
GOOD.

470
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,924
Elise: HE DOESN'T
HAVE THE GUTS

471
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,960
TO TELL ME HE WANTS
A DIVORCE IN PERSON.

472
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,428
I HAVE TO HEAR IT
ON TELEVISION.

473
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,696
ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT.
HARD COPY.

474
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,398
ELISE, BE COOL.
BE CALM.
I AM.

475
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,400
I ACTUALLY SAW
THAT SHOW. IT WAS
RATHER INTERESTING.

476
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,934
OH, TOM, I DON'T
WANNA HEAR ABOUT IT.

477
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,404
Woman: THE MARRIAGE
BETWEEN MY CLIENT
AND MS. ELIOT

478
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,739
RESULTED IN MANY
SUCCESSFUL FILMS,

479
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,808
INCLUDING INNER URGES,

480
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,042
HUMAN INSTINCT,

481
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,911
AND--MY PERSONAL
FAVORITE--

482
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,713
ANIMAL NATURE,

483
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,948
IN WHICH SHE PLAYED
AN EXTREMELY SENSUAL
VETERINARIAN.

484
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:56,949
THANK YOU.

485
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:57,950
MY IDEA.

486
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:58,951
WAS NOT.

487
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,387
WAS TOO.

488
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,355
UM, MY CLIENT
PRODUCED THESE FILMS,

489
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,890
WHICH ENHANCED
MS. ELIOT'S CAREER.

490
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,892
THEREFORE, SHE IS
INDEBTED TO HIM.

491
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,527
I PRODUCED THESE FILMS.

492
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,762
YOU KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT FILMS
WHEN I MET YOU.

493
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,063
I TAUGHT YOU EVERYTHING.

494
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,532
SHH SHH SHH.
WHAT?

495
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,368
THOSE WERE GOOD YEARS,
ELISE. YOUR BEST.

496
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,638
AND THEREFORE
WE REQUEST ONE HALF
OF MS. ELIOT'S ASSETS

497
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,441
AND A MONTHLY STIPEND.

498
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,075
HE WANTS ALIMONY?

499
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,944
AS FOR THE POSSESSIONS:
THE SCULPTURE, ART...

500
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:25,945
THE POSSESSIONS?

501
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,079
AND IMPORTANT OBJETS

502
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,715
COLLECTED DURING
THE MARRIAGE...

503
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:31,117
I WANT TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.
I BOUGHT EVERYTHING.

504
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,585
...DISPOSE
OF THE COLLECTION

505
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,987
AND DIVIDE THE PROCEEDS
IN AN EVEN SPLIT.

506
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,923
BECAUSE THAT--
THEY WERE ANNIVERSARY
PRESENTS.

507
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,558
THEY WERE
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.

508
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,660
I GAVE HIM
EVERYTHING HE HAS,
AND NOW HE WANTS MORE?

509
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,062
GO FASTER. WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE LUNCH--

510
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,665
NOW, LOOK AT THIS.
DUARTO, I ASK YOU.

511
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,100
PLEASE.
NOW, WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO WEAR THAT?

512
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,102
SOME ANOREXIC TEENAGER?
SOME FETUS?

513
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,104
IT'S A CONSPIRACY.
I KNOW IT IS.

514
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,173
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
I'M LEADING A PROTEST.

515
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,108
I AM NEVER BUYING
ANOTHER ITEM OF CLOTHING

516
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,110
UNTIL THESE DESIGNERS
COME TO THEIR SENSES.

517
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,812
WILL YOU SHUT UP?

518
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,981
Annie:
BRENDA WORKED FOR A MAN
NAMED DUARTO FELIZ,

519
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:06,719
ONE OF THE 10 WORST INTERIOR
DECORATORS IN NEW YORK CITY.

520
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:10,056
I THINK HIS REAL NAME
WAS DWAYNE HEMMELWITZ.

521
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,058

01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,459
I BOUGHT THE CAR

1602
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:23,460
IT WAS
ONLY 300 GRAND.

1603
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:25,195
IT WAS A GIFT!

1604
01:04:25,229 --> 01:04:27,064
WITH MY MONEY
YOU BOUGHT IT.
I BOUGHT ME THE GIFT.

1605
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:29,299
JESUS, MORTY,
ALL I WANT IS
A LIFESTYLE.

1606
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:33,303
WITH SOME AMBIANCE
AND--AND SOME CLASSIC,
ETERNAL GOOD TASTE.

1607
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:36,006
BUT NOT FOR $300,000,
SHELLY!

1608
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:48,052
WELL, I CAN LEAVE
IF YOU LIKE.

01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,453
IT'S NOT LIKE...

1610
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,089
YOU'VE ASKED ME
TO MARRY YOU.

1611
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,025
WOULD YOU...

1612
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,994

SHELL,
I--I LOST MY TEMPER.

1616
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:09,006
I'M SORRY.

1617
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,976
THE LAMBORGHINI
IS A VERY GOOD DEAL.

1618
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,081
Brenda: HI, JASE.

1619
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:18,282
HOW WAS THE GAME?

1620
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:19,984
THE KNICKS LOSE AGAIN.

1621
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:22,086
OH. EVERY PLAYER
ON THAT TEAM'S
A MILLIONAIRE.

1622
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,487
THEY CAN'T REALLY LOSE.

1623
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,488
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1624
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:26,090
THAT'S NOT NEW,
IS IT?

1625
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:28,158
IT'S BETTER THAN NEW!

1626
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:29,626
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET
INTO IT IN THREE YEARS!

1627
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,097
LOOK AT ME.
I HAVE A WAIST.
I HAVE LEGS. WHO KNEW?

1628
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,099
HOW'S YOUR FATHER?
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

1629
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,967
YEAH, BUT DON'T
LET THAT BOTHER YOU.

1630
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:38,635
WHAT AN EVIL THING
TO SAY.

1631
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,370
JASON, LOOK,

1632
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:43,073
I--I--I REMEMBER
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
WHEN WE WERE A FAMILY.

1633
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:44,508
IT WAS GREAT.

1634
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:45,742
BUT EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER
ANYMORE,

1635
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,677
YOU STILL HAVE
BOTH OF US.

1636
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:51,481
YOU GUYS CAN'T EVEN
PICK OUT MY BIRTHDAY CARD
WITHOUT A LAWYER.

1637
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:55,452
JASON, I KNOW YOU WORRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

1638
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:56,453
HE'S A...

1639
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:59,456
HE'S A VERY GOOD MAN.

1640
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:01,058
HE'S A VERY GOOD,

1641
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,460
VERY CONFUSED...

1642
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,462
MAN.

1643
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:08,332
AND--AND I KNOW
YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.

1644
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:10,734
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO BE FINE.

1645
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,336
I'M LIGHTENING UP--
LITERALLY.

1646
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:13,603
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

1647
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:16,473
YOUR FATHER AND I,
WE LOVE YOU
TO PIECES.

1648
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,242
OK?

1649
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:20,644
THERE. DID I
EMBARRASS YOU ENOUGH?

1650
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,446
ALMOST.

1651
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,448
WANNA GO TO A MOVIE?

1652
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,116
ME AND YOU?

1653
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,117
TOGETHER?

1654
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:28,118
IN PUBLIC?

1655
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:29,519
MOM, I'M SORRY.

1656
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:31,488
I GUESS I WAS JUST
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT

1657
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:34,991
ABOUT DAD GETTING
ENGAGED TO SHELLY.

1658
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,328
OH, WELL...

1659
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:43,433
YEAH, I--I CAN SEE
WHERE THAT WOULD
RIP YOUR HEART OUT.

1660
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,502
THANKS, MOM.

1661
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,058
WE GOTTA NAIL BILL.

1662
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:09,326
WE GOTTA...

1663
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,228
[SLURRED VOICE]
SLAUGHTER HIM.

1664
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:14,231
RIGHT OFF THE FACE
OF THE PLANET.

1665
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:17,634
HIM AND THAT TRAMP.
THAT INFANT.

1666
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,236
I NEED A DRINK.

1667
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:21,138
Brenda: OH, LORD,
SHE'S LOADED.

1668
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:24,474
BRENDA, I'M WORRIED.
SHE HAD ME LOOK AT
BILL'S RECORDS,

1669
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:25,475
AND THE GUY'S A SAINT.

1670
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:26,676
HE'S CLEAN.

1671
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,412
HE'S A SAINT
WITH A GREAT LAWYER.

1672
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,180
THAT'S ALL.
WHAT?

1673
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:31,748
WHAT? HUH?

1674
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:35,319
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
ON HIM?

1675
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,087
ELISE, I'M SORRY.
I'M GOING TO LOOK AGAIN.

1676
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:39,289
THIS ISN'T FAIR, MAN.

1677
01:07:39,323 --> 01:07:43,460
AARON'S GONNA BE MASSACRED,
MORTY'S NOT GONNA KNOW
WHAT HIT HIM,

1678
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,462
AND BILL'S JUST GONNA
WALK AWAY...

1679
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:46,830
WITH ALIMONY!

1680
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:48,765
WELL, WE'RE JUST GOING
TO KEEP TRYING, ELISE.

1681
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,334
YOU'D BETTER KEEP TRYING,

1682
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:53,137
BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE, OK,
AND MY MONEY!

1683
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,639
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
YOU DON'T GET IT.

1684
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:58,242
YOU'RE...CIVILIANS.
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST...

1685
01:07:58,275 --> 01:07:59,409
HOUSEWIVES.

1686
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,744
THAT'S IT.
NO, WAI--

1687
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:03,513
Elise:
YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

1688
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:04,514
GIMME THAT.

1689
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:05,649
EXCUSE ME.

1690
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,251
GIVE THAT BACK.

1691
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:08,485
I'M SAYING THIS TO YOU
WITH LOVE, COMPASSION,

1692
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:09,886
AND THE SPIRIT
OF TRUE SISTERHOOD.

1693
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,523
YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT!

1694
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:14,724
WHAT?

1695
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,693
SO, OK,
ALIMONY SUCKS.

1696
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,896
OK, YOU DIDN'T GET
TO PLAY A POLICEWOMAN
IN A WONDERBRA.

1697
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,531
BUT LOOK AT YOU!
YOU GREW UP GORGEOUS!

1698
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:23,267
AND THANKS TO CHER'S
PIONEERING EFFORTS,

1699
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,235
YOU STILL
HAVEN'T HIT PUBERTY!

1700
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:27,304
AND ONCE UPON A TIME,
YOU WERE A TERRIFIC ACTRESS!

1701
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,273
YOU'VE EVEN GOT AN OSCAR
TO PROVE IT!

1702
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:31,908
YOU SPENT YOUR WHOLE
LIFE WITH PEOPLE
SUCKING UP TO YOU!

1703
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,710
I'M SURE ANNIE
WILL AGREE WITH ME

1704
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:37,647
WHEN I SAY YOUR PERCEPTION
OF LIFE IS SOMEWHAT ALTERED!

1705
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:39,549
WHAT?
ANNIE, DO YOU
AGREE WITH HER?

1706
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:40,484
HUH?

01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:43,106
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

1875
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:44,708
WELL, ELISE,
IT'S YOUR LOFT,

1876
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,109
AND I'M JUST STORING
THESE THINGS,

1877
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:47,577
OR I'LL BURN THEM
IF YOU WANT.

1878
01:15:47,611 --> 01:15:48,578
B-B-BUT WHY?

1879
01:15:48,612 --> 01:15:50,246
WHY?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

1880
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,149
WE HAVE JUST COMPLETELY
EMBARRASSED OURSELVES.

1881
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:55,752
WE'VE BECOME EXACTLY
WHAT THE WORLD
THINKS WE ARE.

1882
01:15:55,785 --> 01:15:57,086
AND OUR EX-HUSBANDS!

1883
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,288
WE ARE THE THREE WITCHES!

1884
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:00,757
WITCHES?

1885
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,992
WELL--WELL, I'LL
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1886
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:04,694
WHAT?
WITCHES HAVE POWERS.

1887
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:07,096
WELL, THEY DO.
THEY HAVE POWERS
FOR GOOD AND FOR EVIL.

1888
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,865
ANNIE, BRENDA AND I
ARE OK NOW.

1889
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,867
WE'VE BEEN TALKING,
AND WE FIGURED OUT--

1890
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,702
AND WE THINK WE KNOW
WHAT WENT WRONG.

1891
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:14,103
OH, I KNOW WHAT
WENT WRONG!

1892
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:15,739
THIS WHOLE CRACKPOT
IDEA WENT WRONG!

1893
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:17,240
LOOK, REVENGE AND EGOS
AND ALL OF US

1894
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:18,808
THINKING WE COULD
FIX OUR SILLY LIVES!

1895
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:20,910
NO! EXACTLY! WE WERE
THINKING TOO SMALL.

1896
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:22,378
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1897
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,814
WE WERE JUST TRYING
TO GET BACK AT
OUR EX-HUSBANDS,

1898
01:16:24,848 --> 01:16:26,082
WHICH IS A START,
BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH.

1899
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:28,251
IT'S SO PETTY.
IT'S SO LIMITED.

1900
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:30,019
IT'S NO WONDER
WE'RE SNARLING
AT EACH OTHER.

1901
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,755
NO WONDER WE'RE
AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS!

1902
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:34,624
LISTEN! WE HAVE
TO TAKE OUR PLAN
AND EXPAND IT!

1903
01:16:34,658 --> 01:16:36,626
FIRST THING, WE TAKE
CARE OF OUR OWN GUYS

1904
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,027
BECAUSE THEY REALLY
HAVE IT COMING,

1905
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:40,229
AND THEN...
THEN WE GO GLOBAL!

1906
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,798
ARE YOU REALLY
INTERESTED?
HOW?

1907
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,166
'CAUSE IF YOU ARE,
I'LL TELL YOU.

1908
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,101
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M INTERESTED.

1909
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:46,836
WHAT IF WE ERUPT AGAIN?

1910
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,171
OH, ELISE, WHAT IF
YOU START DRINKING,

1911
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:49,906
AND BRENDA, YOU START
SNIPING AWAY?

1912
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:50,907
DONE THAT.
BEEN THERE.

1913
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,275
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR ME.

1914
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:54,778
ANNIE, TAKE
A GOOD LOOK
AT ELISE.

1915
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:56,245
LOOK AT HER!

1916
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,948
I'M SOBER,
AND I'M GONNA DO THE PLAY.

1917
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:00,784
REALLY?

1918
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,285
MM-HMM.
AND I'M GONNA BE
IN THE FRONT ROW
OPENING NIGHT.

1919
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:03,720
THANKS.

1920
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:04,821
FRIENDSHIP IS
EVERYTHING, ANNIE.

1921
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,122
DON'T LEAVE.

1922
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,791
I MEAN, WE CAN'T
FALL APART NOW!

1923
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:09,192
BUT EVEN IF WE WANT TO,

1924
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:10,794
WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH INFORMATION.

1925
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:13,963
OF COURSE,
WE DO HAVE STUFF
ON AARON AND MORTY,

1926
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:15,364
BUT WHAT ABOUT BILL?

1927
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:16,933
I MEAN, ELISE,
YOU'RE STILL
AT SQUARE ONE.

1928
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,401
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

1929
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,003
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I'LL ADMIT THAT SO FAR,

1930
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:22,138
EVERYTHING HE'S DONE HAS
BEEN COMPLETELY LEGAL.

1931
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:23,707
AS FAR AS HE KNOWS.
YEAH!

1932
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,274
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1933
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,411
WELL, IT'S ALL
A QUESTION OF ANGLES.

1934
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:29,713
ARE YOU IN?

1935
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:31,080
ARE YOU BACK?

1936
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:33,349
TALK.

1937
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,719
WELL...
WELL...

1938
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:36,820
THANK YOU.
AFTER YOU.

1939
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:38,121
SO, HERE'S
HOW IT GOES.

1940
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,323
THIS HAS TO BE
JUST BETWEEN US,

1941
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:43,226
BUT I AM
SERIOUSLY THINKING

1942
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:46,429
OF TAKING THE ROLE
OF MONIQUE'S MOM.

1943
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:48,331
OH!

1944
01:17:48,364 --> 01:17:51,735
AND I'VE JUST BEEN
THINKING ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, WHO SHE IS...

1945
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,803
WHAT SHE'S ALL ABOUT...
AND YOU KNOW,

1946
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:55,204
I'M SURE YOU'RE
DOING THE SAME THING
WITH MONIQUE.

1947
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:58,708
OH, SURE! I MEAN, I-I'VE
BEEN THINKING LIKE...

1948
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:00,977
STREAKS...
JUST AROUND MY FACE.

1949
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,346
OH. YEAH.

1950
01:18:03,379 --> 01:18:07,116
AND WHAT
A BEAUTIFUL FACE.

1951
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,417
THANKS.

1952
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,920
ANYWAY, THE REASON
I CALLED YOU

1953
01:18:10,954 --> 01:18:12,288
IS BECAUSE IF WE'RE
GONNA WORK TOGETHER,

1954
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,724
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER.

1955
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:17,226
IT'S IMPORTANT.

1956
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:20,196
BILL IS SO WRONG.

1957
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,131
YOU ARE NOT SATAN.

1958
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:25,068
OH, STOP.

1959
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:27,070
DO YOU NEED A TV?

1960
01:18:27,103 --> 01:18:28,972
OR A VCR?

1961
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:31,007
OR A PERSONAL COMPUTER?

1962
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,244
WHO IS THE FIRST NAME
IN TOP-QUALITY, LOW-COST
APPLIANCES?

1963
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:37,781
WHY, LET'S ASK
THIS BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG LADY HERE!

1964
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:39,415
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?

1965
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:40,416
WHY, HELLO.

1966
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,318
HI.
HELLO.

1967
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:46,489
I'M IN THE MARKET

TO REMAIN SILENT--

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
I'M SHOOTING A COMMERCIAL!

1976
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,335

WHAT IS THIS?

1977
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:00,904
HEY! I'M SHOOTING

HOW'S MY DAY
SHAPING UP?

1986

OHH, POOR DADDY.
IT'S GONNA BE HELL.

01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,291
THAT WAS A VERY
IMPORTANT PHONE CALL!

AND WHERE'S
MY FIRST CHECK?

2000
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,527
JUST SIT DOWN

WELCOME.

2005
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,208
THIS IS KIDNAPPING.

2006
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:47,143
I WILL CRUCIFY YOU.

BIG DEAL.

2010

LETTERS FROM
BRENDA'S FATHER

2011
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:00,523
ABOUT STOCKING
YOUR STORES WITH
STOLEN MERCHANDISE.

2012
01:21:00,556 --> 01:21:03,559
WHAT DO THEY CALL IT
IN THE TABLOIDS?

2013
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:04,560
HOT STUFF.

2014
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,896
YEAH.
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?

2015
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,032
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

2016
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:10,033
WAKE UP...

2017
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,035
AND SMELL THE AUDIT.

2018
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:16,305
AARON, I JUST HAD
A LITTLE TALK
WITH ERIC AND MARK,

2019
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:18,975
AND IT SEEMS THE BUSINESS
IS VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

2020
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:21,310
SORT OF LIKE OUR MARRIAGE.

2021
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:22,345
SO...

2022
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,447

01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:30,353
YEAH. I THINK
WE PROBABLY
OUGHT TO GO.

2025
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,354
WHAT DO YOU
THINK?

2026
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,688
THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

2027
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,690
GOOD-BYE, ERIC.
ANNIE, GOOD LUCK
TO YOU.

LOVE YOU.

2032
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,330
[CHUCKLES]
I DO LOVE
THAT SUIT.

2033
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:48,204
YOU--YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY PULL OFF
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

2034
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:50,273
WHERE WOULD YOU COME UP
WITH THIS KIND OF MONEY?

2035
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:51,474

OUR AGREEMENT,

I THOUGHT A DOLLAR
WAS TERRIBLY FAIR.

2041
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,089
OH, ALL RIGHT.

2042
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:09,558
TAKE IT ALL.

2043
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:10,960
SO, WHAT DO
YOU WANT? MONEY?

2044
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:11,961
EVERY CENT.

2045
01:22:11,995 --> 01:22:13,596
YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR MIND!

2046
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,498
WELL, YOU CAN HAND
IT OVER AND LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER,

2047
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:18,267
OR YOU CAN GIVE IT
TO THE GOVERNMENT
AND GET 10 TO 20.

2048
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:19,635
MAYBE DUARTO
CAN DO YOUR CELL.

2049
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:24,073
"I SEE...BARS."

2050
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:25,441
YOU CAN'T DO
THIS TO ME.

2051
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:27,310
OH, BUT I HAVE
DONE IT TO YOU.

2052
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:30,279
YOU WOULDN'T.
YOU...COULDN'T.

2053
01:22:30,313 --> 01:22:33,983
WELL, IT SEEMS
I COULD AND I DID.

2054
01:22:34,017 --> 01:22:35,484
OH, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT, AARON?

2055
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:37,620
I FORGOT HOW MUCH
FUN WORK CAN BE.

2056
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:40,289
LOOK, IF YOU TRY
TO TAKE MY AGENCY
FROM ME, I'LL WALK.

2057
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:42,258
I'LL TAKE ALL
MY CLIENTS WITH ME.

2058
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,259
BE MY GUEST.

2059
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,161
I'M NOT KIDDING,
ANNIE!

2060
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:47,096
I WILL TAKE EVERY
SINGLE ACCOUNT.

2061
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,066
THIS PLACE,
WITHOUT ME...

2062
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:51,267
WOULD BE WORTHLESS.

2063
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,401
OH, I DON'T
THINK SO, BABE.

2064
01:22:52,435 --> 01:22:54,170
OH, REALLY?

2065
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:59,142
NOT AFTER THE NEW
$45 MILLION ACCOUNT
I JUST LANDED.

2066
01:22:59,175 --> 01:23:01,310
NEW ACCOUNT?
WHAT ACCOUNT?

2067
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:03,512
MORTY'S ELECTRONICS
WILL BE UNDER
MY CONTROL.

2068
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:06,282
ADVERTISING,
MARKETING STRATEGIES,
EVERYTHING.

2069
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,151
YOU WILL STAY
ON AS PRESIDENT

2070
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:11,687
BECAUSE AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE MORTY.

2071
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,089
YOU WILL RECEIVE
A SALARY

2072
01:23:13,122 --> 01:23:15,091
WHICH WILL KEEP YOU
IN THE LIFESTYLE

2073
01:23:15,124 --> 01:23:18,761
TO WHICH I THINK
YOU SHOULD BECOME
ACCUSTOMED.

2074
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:20,563
MORTY, I DON'T SEE
WHAT ELSE YOU CAN DO.

2075
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:22,798
IT'S THIS...OR JAIL.

2076
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,401
SO I DUMPED YOU
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

2077
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:26,435
GET OVER IT.

2078
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:27,636
LIFT SOMETHING.
WAX SOMETHING.

2079
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,172
HAVE SOMETHING
PEELED.

2080
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:30,673
YOU'RE RIGHT...

2081
01:23:30,706 --> 01:23:32,675
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT I'M--I'M JEALOUS.

2082
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:35,478
MISS LaVELLE IS
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.

2083
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,280
SHE'S A BRIGHT
NEW STAR.

2084
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:38,581
INTERESTED, ELISE?

2085
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:40,483
WANT TO DRINK
HER BLOOD?

2086
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,451
HOW OLD IS SHE,
BILL?

2087
01:23:42,485 --> 01:23:44,353
25? 26?

2088
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:45,454
21.

2089
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:50,459
YEAH...
IN ABOUT 5 YEARS.

2090
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:52,328
SHE'S 16.

2091
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,130
WHAT?

2092
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:56,065
2 YEARS AGO,
SHE DROPPED OUT OF
A LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL

2093
01:23:56,099 --> 01:23:58,834
IN NEWKIRK, IDAHO.

2094
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,170
SHOULD HAVE DONE
YOUR HOMEWORK, BILL.

2095
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:02,305
I DID.

2096
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:05,574
OH, A COPY OF HER
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

2097
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,743
OH, GOD.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

2098
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:10,613
OH, MY GOD. WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

2099
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:13,216
OH...WHAT AM I
GONNA DO?

2100
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:16,485
WELL...RIGHT NOW,

2101
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:19,622
I'M JUST GOING TO
USE THE "F" WORD.

2102
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:21,424
FELONY.

2103
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:24,727
I THINK WE SHOULD
CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION
IN MY OFFICE.

2104
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,162
THAT'S RIGHT.
IN YOUR OFFICE?

2105
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:27,330
IS THAT ALL
YOU CAN DO?

2106
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:28,797
THINK OF YOURSELF,
YOURSELF, YOURSELF?

2107
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:31,334
IF YOU GO
THROUGH WITH THIS,
I'LL HAVE NOTHING.

2108
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:33,202
OHH.
LOOK, EVERYONE
IN TOWN IS LOOKING
FOR THE NEW GUY.

2109
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:35,371
HOW CAN I COMPETE?
WHO THE HELL'S
GONNA WANT ME?

2110
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:37,640
I'M 46 YEARS OLD.

2111
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:39,675
I'D HAVE TO START
FROM SCRATCH.

2112
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:42,478
I KNOW JUST
HOW YOU FEEL.

2113
01:24:44,147 --> 01:24:46,014
OH, AARON...

2114
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:52,121
GROW FROM LOVE.

2115
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:00,596
OH, I DON'T HATE YOU.

2116
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:02,465
I WISH I COULD,

2117
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:03,599
BUT YOU'RE STILL
KIND OF CUTE

2118
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:05,734
FOR AN OVERBEARING,
CRADLE-ROBBING,

2119
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:08,304
SPANDEX-SUCKING
CRIMINAL.

2120
01:25:08,337 --> 01:25:10,139
SO, I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY.

2121
01:25:10,173 --> 01:25:12,475
OH, DON'T MISUNDERSTAND.
I'M GOING TO TAKE PLENTY.

2122
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:16,779
AND I'M GONNA HANG
ONTO THESE 'CAUSE I'VE
GOT A FAVOR TO ASK.

2123
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:19,382
BE THERE IN 2 HOURS.

2124
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:22,585
WHILE WE WERE MARRIED,
I HELPED YOU.

2125
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,653
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO HELP OTHERS.

2126
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:25,754
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

2127
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,356
TO SEE
BARBARA WALTERS.

2128
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:28,557
OH, MY GOD!

2129
01:25:28,591 --> 01:25:30,159
SCARED?

2130
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:31,694
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS, ARE YOU?

2131
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:34,230
WELL, THAT
DEPENDS ON YOU.

2132
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:36,565
BE THERE AT THAT ADDRESS
IN 2 HOURS.

2133
01:25:36,599 --> 01:25:37,766
BABE.

2134
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,305
Annie: YOU SEE, WHAT BRENDA
MEANT BY THINKING GLOBALLY

2135
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:45,574
WAS THAT IT SIMPLY
WASN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE
OUR FORMER HUSBANDS SUFFER.

2136
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:49,178
TO DO THE TRULY
CHARITABLE, UNSELFISH THING,

2137
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:52,315
WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THEM
SUFFER OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

2138
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:53,716
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS IN FOR?

2139
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:54,717
GENTLEMEN...

2140
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,552
AND DADDY.

2141
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:07,830
HONEY?

2142
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:09,232
HMM?

2143
01:26:09,265 --> 01:26:10,899
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2144
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:12,701
I--I DON'T THINK
I CAN TAKE ANY MORE
SURPRISES TODAY.

2145
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:14,270
OHH.

2146
01:26:15,238 --> 01:26:16,539
OH, DADDY?

2147
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:21,410
I'M A LESBIAN...

2148
01:26:21,444 --> 01:26:22,911
A BIG ONE.

2149
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,318
GENTLEMEN,
WE'VE GATHERED
YOU HERE TODAY

2150
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:31,287
FOR A VERY
SPECIFIC REASON.

2151
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,289
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
RETALIATION,

2152
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:34,957
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
NEGOTIATION,

2153
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:38,727
AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT
MEN VERSUS WOMEN.

2154
01:26:38,761 --> 01:26:39,962
YEAH? WELL,
WHAT IS IT THEN?

2155
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:41,530
I'M GETTING SICK
OF THIS, OK?

2156
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:42,865
PLEASE DON'T
MAKE HER MAD.

2157
01:26:42,898 --> 01:26:45,701
Elise: NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS NOT A REVENGE THING.

2158
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:48,404
THIS IS
ABOUT JUSTICE.

2159
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:49,805
HALFWAY THROUGH
THIS OPERATION,

2160
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:52,408
WE REALIZED THAT
THE ONLY PEOPLE

2161
01:26:52,441 --> 01:26:54,977
THAT WOULD BE HELPED
BY REVENGE WOULD BE US.

2162
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:57,480
AND THEN WE'D BE
NO BETTER THAN YOU.

2163
01:26:57,513 --> 01:26:58,981
Brenda: HAPPIER,
BUT NO BETTER.

2164
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:00,583
EXHILARATED,
BUT NO BETTER.

2165
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:02,618
ECSTATIC,
BUT NO BETTER.

2166
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:03,986
SO WE THOUGHT AGAIN.

2167
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:07,390
A VERY DEAR
FRIEND OF OURS
DIED FROM NEGLECT.

2168
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:10,559
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP
US MAKE VERY SURE THAT
THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

2169
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:11,727
LIKE HELL
WE ARE!

2170
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,028
YOU CAN'T MAKE
US DO ANYTHING.

2171
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:16,732
NO...BUT VITO CAN.
AND JOEY CAN.

2172
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:18,567
AND UNCLE
CARMINE CAN!

2173
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,878
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO?

2174
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:31,714
YOU HAVE TO PAY.

2175
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:38,454
OH!
OH!

2176
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:40,423
OH, MY GOD!

2177
01:27:40,456 --> 01:27:41,624
HA HA!

2178
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,763
* NOW, THERE WAS A TIME

2179
01:27:47,796 --> 01:27:51,500
* WHEN THEY USED TO SAY

2180
01:27:51,534 --> 01:27:55,037
* THAT BEHIND
EVERY GREAT MAN *

2181
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:59,007
* THERE HAD
TO BE A GREAT WOMAN *

2182
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:02,378
* NOW THEN, THESE
TIMES HAVE CHANGED *

2183
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:06,315
* YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S NO LONGER TRUE *

2184
01:28:06,349 --> 01:28:09,652
* SO, WE'RE COMING
OUT OF THE KITCHEN *

2185
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:12,555
* 'CAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING
WE FORGOT TO SAY TO YOU *

2186
01:28:12,588 --> 01:28:19,795
* IT'S THAT SISTERS ARE
DOIN' IT FOR THEMSELVES *

2187
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:23,098
* STANDING ON
THEIR OWN TWO FEET *

2188
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:27,102
* AND RINGING ON
THEIR OWN BELLS *

2189
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:33,476
* IT'S THAT SISTERS ARE
DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES *

2190
01:28:33,509 --> 01:28:34,477
* YEAH!

2191
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,945
* THIS IS A SONG

2192
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:41,083
* TO CELEBRATE

2193
01:28:41,116 --> 01:28:44,753
* THE CONSCIOUS LIBERATION

2194
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:48,791
* OF THE FEMALE STATE

2195
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,593
* MOTHERS, DAUGHTERS

2196
01:28:50,626 --> 01:28:56,432
* AND THEIR DAUGHTERS,
TOO, YEAH! *

2197
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:58,901
* WOMAN TO WOMAN

2198
01:28:58,934 --> 01:29:02,771
* WE'RE SINGING WITH YOU

2199
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:05,508
* THE INTERIOR SEX

2200
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,643
* HAS GOT A NEW EXTERIOR

2201
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,412
* YEAH!

2202
01:29:09,445 --> 01:29:16,852
* WE GOT DOCTORS, LAWYERS,
POLITICIANS, TOO *

2203
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:19,722
* YEAH, YEAH

2204
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:23,726
* TAKE A LOOK AROUND

2205
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:26,429
* CAN YOU SEE?
CAN YOU SEE? CAN YOU SEE? *

2206
01:29:26,462 --> 01:29:29,465
* THERE'S A WOMAN
