1
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,300
<i>Middlebury College, 1969,</i>
<i>the year of walking on the moon -</i>

2
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,400
<i>- "Yellow Submarine"</i>
<i>and Woodstock.</i>

3
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,300
<i>Also the year that Pope Paul the VI</i>
<i>eliminated 200 saints. Amen.</i>

4
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,500
<i>And I, along wlth my three best</i>
<i>friends, graduated from college.</i>

5
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Where's Cynthia? We've got
to get going. I mean, shouldn't we?

6
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,400
Calm down, Annie.
She said she had a surprise.

7
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
How is this?
Is this heaven?

8
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,700
Elise, you are so gorgeous. Really!
Oh, my. It's lovely.

9
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,000
- It's solid.
- Oh, girls.

10
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,700
- Cynthia.
- Here. Open. Put them on.

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,700
Oh, my God!

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Oh, my God.
You shouldn't have done this.

13
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,500
- It's too much.
- I don't think so. It's just enough.

14
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,700
You'll all write me nice notes,
but now we need a toast.

15
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,100
- Got it.
- Pour, pour! It's picture time.

16
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,100
- Champagne!
- From my folks.

17
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,600
To Annie, Elise and Brenda.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
And Cynthia,
I mean our valedictorian.

19
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,700
All right. We're all bound together
forever by friendship and love.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,300
And jewelry!

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,400
And we're always going
to be there for each other.

22
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,300
- Oh, God! I'm gonna cry!
- Here! For the rest of our lives.

23
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
- One, two, three...
- How's my hair?

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,300
It's good.

25
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,400
Mrs. Cynthia?

26
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,000
Teresa...

27
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,100
- I want you to have these.
- No, no, no.

28
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,700
-Yes, yes, yes.
- I cannot take...

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,400
- You just think of it as a raise, OK?
- Thank you.

30
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Now, you take the rest of the day off.
Go on.

31
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,900
- Thank you.
- Would you mind mailing these?

32
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,700
<i>Of the four of us, Cynthia was</i>
<i>certainly the most likely to succeed.</i>

33
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,900
<i>When she decided to do something -</i>

34
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,700
<i>- she just went ahead and did it.</i>

35
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
Roachie. Come on, honey.
It's Mommy. Mommy's home.

36
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
Gosh, think we got any messages?

37
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,900
- What do you think, huh?
- Annie, dear, it's your mother.

38
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,500
<i>It's 6am. Please call me urgently.</i>

39
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,900
Chris!...Honey, I thought you
were going to campus yesterday.

40
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,200
My classes were cancelled.
I slept here. Where were you?!

41
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
I was... I was at a friend's.

42
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,700
You were with that man again.
Mother, I am so disappointed.

43
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,100
I'm sorry, but he <i>is</i> your father.

44
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,900
He's using you.
You shouldn't let him.

45
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not that simple.
The truth is I love your father.

46
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,000
- I'm sure he loves me.
- You're a doormat!

47
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,700
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so crabby today?

48
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,300
Is it school?.. I know what it is.

49
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,600
- It's a boy.
- I'm a lesbian, mom.

50
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm a lesbian.
But that's not the issue here.

51
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,600
- When you say "lesbian"...
- Don't tell Daddy.

52
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,200
I want to tell him myself when the time
is right. Like Father's Day.

53
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,800
- Or Christmas morning.
- Chris...

54
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,400
Thank God, you're all right.

55
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,400
Where were you?
Who saw you?

56
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,300
- Who saw me what?
- She was sleeping with Daddy.

57
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,200
Muffin, you've come
to your senses. I'm so happy.

58
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,600
Mother, I don't sleep with Aaron.
He has problems with his partners.

59
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,200
He's very conflicted, and he
needed somebody to talk to.

60
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,400
- Doormat!
- Lesbian.

61
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,400
Do it, Morris.
Do it to me now. I need it.

62
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
You're the only one who does it
the way I like it. You're the king.

63
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,900
Any more collagen, your lips will look
like they were stuck in a pool drain.

64
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,100
I haven't worked in 18 months.

65
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,300
I have a meeting with a director
for a part I would kill for.

66
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,200
- I have to look sexy.
- Elise, you are sexy!

67
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,700
Look at yourself. You're incredible.
You're my masterpiece.

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,300
- There's not one line on your face.
- Really? What do you call that?

69
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,300
- And these? What are these?
- You're 45.

70
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,800
One more facelift,
you'll be able to blink your lips.

71
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,000
- Don't you want to play your age?
- My own age?!

72
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,600
You don't understand. There are only
three ages for women in Hollywood:

73
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,400
Babe, district attorney
and "Driving Miss Daisy".

74
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,000
And right now, I want to be young.
Science Fiction "young"!

75
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,900
This is good. Maybe you should
also cut down on the booze.

76
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,000
I know you're upset about the divorce.

77
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,400
- Upset?
- You're upset about Bill's movie.

78
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,900
This isn't about him!
This is about my lips! Look at me.

79
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,600
I want Tina Turner. I want Jagger.

80
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,400
Fill 'em up.

81
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,600
Really? This is fabulous news.
Thank you. Bye... Jason!

82
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Jason! Honey!

83
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,200
Yoo-hoo! "Burning Sensation"
just confirmed.

84
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,200
Jason!

85
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,600
- What?
- "Burning Sensation" confirmed.

86
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
- I got the band you wanted.
- Cool!

87
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,200
Affection!

88
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,000
Gimme that!

89
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
- What is this?
- Hebrew!

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,100
Your Bar Mitzvah's in 3 weeks...
the one thing your father will pay for.

91
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,000
- Learn it!
- Mom!

92
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,600
Don't "but, Mom" me! Learn it.
Don't shame me in the synagogue.

93
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,100
The separation from Aaron is absurd.

94
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,600
How will you fix things
if you're not together?

95
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,600
We're practically together.
We're seeing the same therapist.

96
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,200
- What?
- Her name is Dr. Leslie Rosen.

97
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,300
She's incredible. She helps
Aaron with commitment issues.

98
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,100
We're working on my self-esteem.

99
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,900
You're married with a daughter.
You're happy. Who needs self-esteem!

100
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,800
Mother!

101
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,700
Dr. Rosen says that...

102
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,900
She says you're very controlling.

103
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,300
Me? Controlling?

104
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,400
That is ridiculous.

105
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,900
- Mother, I...
- Roach...

106
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Go!

107
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
What if I found somebody else,
mother? It's possible.

108
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,700
You're 46. You're more likely
to be slaughtered by a psycho.

109
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,700
<i>Cynthia Swann Griffin is dead. The</i>
<i>former wife of Wall Street wizard...</i>

110
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,500
Didn't you go to school with her?

111
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,500
<i>...jumped from her</i>
<i>fashionable penthouse apartment.</i>

112
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,500
<i>Mrs. Griffin had recently divorced</i>
<i>her longtime husband -</i>

113

<i>- Gilbert Griffin. The Wall Street</i>
<i>baron remarried only yesterday.</i>

114
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,900
- Morning, Mohammed.
- Morning, Miss Eliot.

115
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
Elise!

116
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,400
- Oh, God. What a tragedy!
- Poor Cynthia.

117
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
And your lips!

118
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,800
<i>Elise arrived with</i>
<i>Gunilla Garson-Goldberg.</i>

119
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,700
<i>The queen of New York society.</i>
<i>Nobody gets anywhere -</i>

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
<i>- in this town without</i>
<i>Gunilla's say-so.</i>

121
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,400
Hey, Elise!

122
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,600
She looks wonderful.
Has she had any work done?

123
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Honey, she's a quilt.

124
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,900
<i>Then came Cynthia's</i>
<i>former husband Gilbert Griffin.</i>

125
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,300
<i>A man made rich by</i>
<i>his first wife's connections and now -</i>

126
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,000
<i>- made happy by his</i>
<i>second wife's youthful good looks.</i>

127
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
The vampire Lestat. And Louis.

128
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,000
What a nerve!
He should be hanging his head.

129
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,700
You don't know
what he feels right now.

130
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,500
I knew you would be here.

131
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,100
Alice!

132
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,700
- No, Annie.
- Annie!

133
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,200
It's so wonderful to see you.
You're wearing our pearls.

134
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,200
Yeah.

135
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,400
- Hi. It's Brenda. Brenda Morang.
- Brenda!

136
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Annie. Remember me!

137
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,000
- You look wonderful.
- You do too. You look just...

138
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
- ...uncanny.
- Thank you.

139
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,500
Dear, sweet, funny, yearning Brenda.

140
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
What?

141
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,700
- She's such a bitch.
- I hate that guy.

142
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,300
This might sound horrible after
that but I would really...

143
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,700
- I'd love to...
- Lunch?

144
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,600
No, you're right. It's not right.

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,100
Why? We gotta eat. I have a car.

146
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,300
- A limo.
- Yeah.

147
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,600
It is so wonderful seeing you all.

148
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,200
- Elise.
- What?

149
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,800
You have not changed a bit in 20 years.

150
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,400
Not one little bit.

151
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,800
It's utterly bizarre.

152
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,500
- Brenda!
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

153
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,300
Ladies, would anyone like a drink?

154
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,100
- Yes, I would like a Virgin Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

155
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,900
- Vodka rocks, please.
- Now, I just want to...

156
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,500
...get this out of the way.
I'm the most terrible person.

157
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,000
I tried to stay in touch.
I should have written every month.

158
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,200
Annie you had a life to lead.

159
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,300
It must have been time-consuming,
churning out those newsletters.

160
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,400
It's a terrible excuse for a reunion -

161
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,500
- but here we all are.
How are you guys, huh?

162
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,900
Just fine. Couldn't be better.

163
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,300
- Things are rolling along for me.
- Same here. Knock wood.

164
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,500
Knock wood.

165
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,400
- It's great to see you guys again.
- Cheers.

166
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,700
Why'd she do it? I don't understand.
Could I have helped her?

167
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,100
What would make her want to?

168
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,600
She gave Gil the best years
of her life. Sacrificed her youth...

169
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,900
Always put herself last to bolster
his ego, his drive, his ambition.

170
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,900
Just as her dignity hung by a thread,
he ran off with a pre-schooler.

171
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,100
- I'm guessing.
- Elise...

172
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,200
You too?

173
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,900
You...Brenda?

174
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,600
- Brenda?
- Morty was a big shot on TV.

175
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He sold electronics. On our 20th
wedding anniversary, it hits...

176
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,500
...mid-life crisis...Major! He starts
working out, grows a mustache.

177
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,400
He gets an earring. I said:
"Morty, what are you...a pirate?"

178
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,100
"What's next? A parrot?"

179
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,500
Suddenly, I'm a drag. I'm holding
him back because I won't rollerblade.

180
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,900
- What's her name?
- Shelly.

181
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,500
Shelly the barracuda. She's 12.

182
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Bren... Elise.

183
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,100
I am so sorry about
both of your marriages.

184
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,200
I wish I could have helped or
been there in some way.

185
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,000
- What about your marriage?
- Everything's just fine.

186
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,000
Aaron is so terrific...

187
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,300
Now, let's think...we've been
married for 25 years...

188
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,900
Chris is perfect. I mean,
lesbians are great...nowadays!

189
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,300
The marriage is going...
It's going to be really fine.

190
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,600
Aaron and I...we're...

191
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,500
..temporarily sort of...
We're separated!

192
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,100
- Separated.
- Separated?

193
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,700
Separated.

194
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,900
OK, Elise, the time has come...

195
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Spill! Those lips...what's in 'em?

196
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,300
- Are they wax?
- Excuse me?

197
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,100
What else did you have done?
You can tell me.

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,000
The cheeks, the jawline...
Have just a little or the full enchilada?

199
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,900
I work out daily, watch my diet.

200
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
- I haven't had plastic surgery!
- Good for you!

201
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,300
- You look terrific.
- Come on!

202
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
You're lying through your caps!

203
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,100
OK, I have been refreshed a little.

204
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
- Oh, God, does it hurt?
- No.

205
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,600
The stuff they take off...
Can you keep it?

206
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,100
Come on, it's the 90s.

207
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,100
Plastic surgery is like good grooming.
It's like brushing your teeth.

208
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:11,200
Elise, you've been yanked, stitched,
stuffed and pulled. You're a turkey.

209
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,600
- And to please your ex-husband?
- No...

210
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,300
...to please everybody.
To please everybody!

211
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,000
Men, women, studio executives.
Come on, youth and beauty.

212
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,200
Men, that's the ticket!

213
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,500
When men... No, when women
get to be a certain age...

214
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,100
- ...bye, bye love. Hello, poptarts.
- That's right, baby.

215
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,700
It's a holocaust.

216
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,200
God, I wish I had the courage
to give it all up. To say...

217
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,800
...who gives a rat's ass.
Just let myself go like you two did.

218
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,500
No offense.

219
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,200
- None taken.
- Speak for yourself, OK!

220
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,200
Elise, you're gifted,
talented and successful.

221
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,500
Brenda, you're wonderfully verbal.

222
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,300
And I am seeing
a very talented therapist.

223
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,800
We're in our prime! By the way,
my marriage is fine, thank you.

224
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,600
Annie, you have an amazing attitude.

225
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,300
You are...so cheerful.

226
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,800
- You are...
- Look at me.

227
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
You are genuinely happy.

228
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,700
- It's a beautiful thing.
- Thank you.

229
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,600
Lithium?

230
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,000
You'd have been proud of me, Leslie.
I was the only positive one there.

231
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,300
There were traces of the wonderful,
witty women I knew before -

232
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,900
- but they're just so angry.They're so
confused. When we were young...

233
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,800
- ...we had such spirit.
- Say it, honey.

234
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,400
- Work from love.
- OK, work from love.

235
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,400
- Grow from love.
- Grow from love.

236
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,100
Screw the world.

237
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,300
- I can't say that. I'm sorry.
- Annie, you are still doing it.

238
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,900
- I know.
- You have a problem with anger.

239
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,500
You're absolutely right.

240
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,900
It's my... I don't know what it is!
It's my mother. It's Connecticut.

241
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,500
- It's all these loud noises.
- And Aaron.

242
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I know we're separated.
But I think this is really a rest period.

243
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
We're just getting our...

244
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,700
- Do it, Annie! Get angry.
- I couldn't. I know that I should...

245
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,300
- It's just...
- Hit me.

246
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,200
Stand up and hit me.

247
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,600
I can't. I'm so sorry. Maybe...

248
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Let it out. I want you to hit me.
Trust me. It's OK.

249
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,300
OK.

250
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,700
Rambo!

251
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,700
A real tough guy.
Come on, Annie...

252
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,500
- Hit me!
- I love that.

253
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,600
- My God.
- That was better.

254
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,200
- I'm sorry. Please don't tell Aaron.
- Time's up.

255
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,200
- Time to go. Do you feel better?
- Thank you.

256
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,800
He hasn't the guts to tell me he wants
a divorce. I have to hear it on TV.

257
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
- Elise, be cool. Be calm.
- I am!

258
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,800
- I saw that show. It was interesting.
- I don't want to hear it.

259
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,400
My client's and Miss Eliot's marriage
resulted in many successful films -

260
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,000
- including "Inner Urges",
"Human lnstinct" -

261
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,200
- and "Animal Nature" in which she
played a sensuous veterinarian.

262
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,100
- Thank you.
- My idea!

263
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,300
- Was not.
- Was too.

264
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,800
My client produced these films
which enhanced Miss Eliot's career.

265
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,400
- Therefore, she is indebted to him.
- I produced these films!

266
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,700
You knew nothing when I met you.

267
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,900
I taught you everything! What?

268
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Those were your best years, Elise.

269
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,300
Therefore, we request half of Miss
Eliot's assets and a monthly stipend.

270
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
He wants alimony?

271
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
As for the sculpture, art, Japanese
porcelain and <i>objets d'art-</i>

272
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,100
- collected during the marriage,
my client thinks it fair for Miss Eliot -

273
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,000
- to dispose of the items
and divide the proceeds evenly.

274
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,900
They were anniversary presents -

275
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,300
- Xmas presents. I gave him
everything. Now he wants more?!

276
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:49,000
Now, Duarto, I ask you: who's this
for? An anorexic teen? A fetus?

277
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
It's a conspiracy. I know it is. I've
had enough. I'm leading a protest.

278
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,100
I'm not buying any more clothes until
designers come to their senses.

279
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,600
<i>Brenda worked for a</i>
<i>man named Duarto Feliz -</i>

280
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,700
<i>- one of the ten worst</i>
<i>interior decorators in New York.</i>

281
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,200
<i>I think his real name</i>
<i>was Duane Hemelwitz.</i>

282
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,700
- It's electric. Look at this hideous...
- I can't afford it.

283
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,300
You've got to have it. Try it on.
You could sell a broach, your son...

284
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,500
Duarto...

285
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,100
- Morty! Look at you.
- Brenda, don't embarrass me.

286
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,300
Don't embarrass me.
Don't make a scene.

287
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,000
You've got nerve.
Know what's embarrassing?

288
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,000
Being hassled by Mr. Zaworsky
because I'm behind in the rent.

289
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,600
That's embarrassing. Worrying about
how to pay for my kid's college.

290
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,600
You know what? You never listened.
20 years and you never listened.

291
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,200
Here! Try this on in the fitting
room. It looks very nice.

292
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,300
I could use this. It's very
beautiful. I love the color...

293
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,000
But what can I use for money?
How am I gonna pay for it?

294
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,200
The company is expanding. Not me!
I'm a mere laborer.

295
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,300
- You're a liar and a fraud.
- I have no money. I'm not rich.

296
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,400
- Why don't you look in your purse?
- Very funny.

297
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,900
- They're stunning, Morton. I want 'em.
- Morton?

298
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,600
- Oh, God, make it go away.
- Shelly, look at you.

299
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,900
- The bulimia has paid off.
- Don't start.

300
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,500
What's the matter, Morty?
Can't you buy her a whole dress?

301
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Why don't you try these on
in your size?

302
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,200
- It was a delight running into you.
<i>- You've read the script.</i>

303
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,800
Yes, it is so original. It's so good.

304
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,100
You're so gifted, Brett.

305
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,700
And Monique... "Monique"...

306
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,600
She is a great character.

307
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,500
Thank you. Man, what a kick!

308
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,300
Elise Eliot in a Brett Artounian film.

309
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,100
So, tell me how do you see her?

310
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Well, uh, I think we go for...

311
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,600
- ...grotesque.
- What?

312
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,400
All the way. No make-up, overhead
lighting. Bring out every wrinkle...

313
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,500
Every crag.
With you in the part -

314
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,500
- Monique's mother won't be another
Jurassic fleshbag in a wheelchair.

315
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
She's epic.

316
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,200
Elise Eliot,
the crypt-keeper. Wow!

317
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,100
Mom, I'm spending the night
at Dad's. Don't worry, I'm studying.

318
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,200
<i>Baruch atta adonoy...</i>
Happy now?

319
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,500
Maurice?

320
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,500
I want another one.
They want me to play the mother.

321
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,400
- Sorry.
- The mother!

322
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Let me ask you something.

323
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
- Is this the face of a mother?
- No, ma'am.

324
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,400
Certainly not mine.

325
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,200
So I thought.

326
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Not to be critical,
but you've no feeling for noodles.

327
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,300
Thank you, Mom.

328
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,500
Hello.

329
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,400
Aaron... Nothing...
Just having pasta with mother.

330
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,700
No, you say... Sure!

331
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,500
That would be good. Bye.

332
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,100
We're going to have dinner!
Can you believe that? Oh my God!

333
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,100
Do you know what this means?
It means he's re-prioritized.

334
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,700
He's worked through his
relationship phobias -

335
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,100
- his fear of intimacy, his thing about
my poisoning his food.

336
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,100
He's ready to recommit.

337
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

338
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,300
Excuse me, so sorry.

339
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,500
<i>Una?</i>
By yourself?

340
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,100
<i>Si.</i>

341
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,500
- How are you?
- Hello. Allow me.

342
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,700
I'm not Monique's mother. Angela
Lansbury's Monique's mother.

343
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,500
- Shelley Winters is Unique's mother.
- Now, that's good.

344
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,400
- Sean Connery's Unique's mother.
- Perhaps some coffee now.

345
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:14,600
I take that back. Sean Connery
is Monique's boyfriend.

346
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,300
He's 300 years old,
but he's still a stud.

347
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,700
- I'm not happy, Maurice.
- I'm going to get you that coffee.

348
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,300
- Honey... I think I should go.
- I know.

349
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:51,500
Tomorrow, we could start moving
your things back in...if that's okay?

350
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,200
I hated seeing your side
of the closet all empty.

351
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,700
Dr. Rosen...she would be proud of us.
I wish she were here.

352
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Not literally. I can't wait to tell her
how we worked it all out.

353
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,300
We should get therapy gold stars.

354
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,800
Annie...

355
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,900
I love you.

356
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,200
Come here.

357
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

358
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
I love you.

359
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,800
I want a divorce.

360
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,100
- Stay calm.
- But we just made love!

361
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,000
You asked me out.

362
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,900
I asked you out to tell you,
but you looked so great.

363
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,700
I thought: "How romantic.
One last time."

364
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,100
- A goodbye kiss.
- But this wasn't just a kiss.

365
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't be childish.
You know how you manipulate me.

366
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,200
- What?! Manipulate?
- Don't.

367
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,000
What?.. Oh my God.

368
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,300
- Is there someone else?
- No. This is about us.

369
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,000
It's really not you.

370
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
Babe?

371
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,700
Oh my God!

372
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,600
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God.

373
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,500
- This is very awkward.
- No, Annie was just leaving.

374
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,100
- You told her?
- I was totally upfront.

375
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
What? Excuse me!

376
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,900
Annie, this is rough.
I know that.

377
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,300
Rough?! Wait a minute.
I don't understand. You're my therapist?

378
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,200
- I'm a woman.
- He is my husband.

379
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,000
We've been separated for months.
Let's not overdramatize, OK?

380
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,600
She's allowed to be angry.
- Annie, let's use this.

381
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,600
He's found someone new.
You're free! Closure!

382
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm sorry,
but that isn't what this is.

383
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
You're not helping us out here.

384
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,200
- Now, I'm sorry.
- So am I!

385
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:15,900
Very sorry I ever met you!
Sorry I loved you for all those years!

386
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,700
I'm sorry I was there
for you every minute -

387
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,900
- of every day and supported
you in your every move.

388
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,500
I'm sorry!

389
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,700
Oh, my God.

390
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,700
"I wish I had talent like Elise"-

391
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,300
- "Brenda's humor" -

392
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,100
- "or your strength, Annie."

393
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,000
"Most of all I wish
I still had our friendship."

394
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,900
"Perhaps Gil isn't the problem."
Oh, God...

395
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,200
"Perhaps loneliness is."

396
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,200
"Please take care of each other.
Love, Cynthia."

397
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,000
- And on such pretty stationery.
- I have to make some calls, Mom.

398
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,200
- God, poor Cynthia.
- If only she had called me.

399
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,800
If only I were listed.

400
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,300
You know what? She was right.
In college we were focused.

401
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,600
We were brave.
We couldn't wait.

402
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,300
It's all over. I'm alone.
I don't have anything.

403
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,300
I don't have anything!

404
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,200
You have a son who adores you.
I'm alone! I'm Monique's mother.

405
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,100
But Jason's off to college pretty
soon. I'll be even more alone.

406
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,400
Plus I'll be a lot older.

407
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,500
Any more plastic surgery,
I won't be able to sleep.

408
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,200
I'll have to work at McDonalds!

409
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,100
-I'll have to do ads for adult diapers.
- I'll have to wear them.

410
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,200
I just spent 25 years -

411
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,800
- with a self-absorbed man
who is marrying my therapist...

412
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,800
- ...who lectured me on self-esteem.
- You win!

413
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I won't be that woman anymore.
It's unacceptable.

414
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,200
It is unacceptable! I made
all those stupid movies with Bill.

415
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,000
I gave him a career
and he stole mine.

416
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,700
I worked behind the cash register
at his first store...in his first 15 stores!

417
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,800
I gave Aaron a home
and a daughter.

418
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,300
- I washed and ironed his shorts.
- You did?

419
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,700
Well, I supervised.

420
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,100
What do we want? Revenge?

421
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,900
No! We are not talking about revenge.
I am talking about justice.

422
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,600
I'm going to give Aaron so much
justice he won't see straight...

423
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,700
- ...if he thinks partners are trouble.
- Bill's always had it easy.

424
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,200
That's right. Bill's had it easy
every inch of the way.

425
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
He's always had a woman
look after him.

426
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,600
What would happen one day
if he didn't?

427
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,400
What do you think, Brenda?

428
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,600
I love Morty. Very deeply.

429
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,600
- I wouldn't want to see him harmed.
- You don't?

430
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,400
I want him dumped!
By Little Miss Midriff.

431
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,100
By that Stairmastered
L'Orealed crotch jockey.

432
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,700
In front of
the whole Western Hemisphere.

433
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:24,400
On the 6 o'clock news. Okay!
After that I want world peace.

434
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,300
Let's get serious. We helped them rise.
We can help them fall.

435
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,900
How are we going to do that.

436
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,400
We're has-beens, hanging on
by a thread. We're discards.

437
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,300
We're not hanging on by a thread.
Look, by being together - us - unity.

438
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,300
If all the first wives of the world
got together...

439
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,400
- ...what else do we need?
- Just one amazing attorney.

440
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,800
All we need is us.
Three women who aren't afraid to fight.

441
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Stand up for dignity and self-esteem!
Then we'll let 'em have it.

442
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,600
- See this?
- What?

443
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
- Wait, right here, OK?
- OK.

444
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,500
See this? Put it in there.

445
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,400
All right. First Wives Club,
come to order.

446
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,400
<i>Starting the club was easy.</i>

447
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,700
<i>Figuring out what to do next</i>
<i>was much harder.</i>

448
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,300
<i>We each decided to gather</i>
<i>information about our husbands.</i>

449
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,900
- Elise, Elise...
- Yeah...

450
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,100
<i>I went in search of a spy.</i>

451
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,500
Why can't we call Chris
and ask her to help us?

452
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,600
I want her to know I support
her lifestyle completely.

453
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,600
- I've never been to a gay bar!
- Here we go.

454
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,700
Hi, I think you're just terrific.

455
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,100
Look at this. My God!
Isn't this great? All these women.

456
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,900
Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky.

457
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,900
Elise Eliot, right?
You're from the movies.

458
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
- Yeah...
- I knew you were gay!

459
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,900
I said Elise Eliot is so hot!
You're like the most -

460
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
- amazing babe on this planet.

461
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,700
God bless you!

462
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,700
- You wanna dance?
- Uh, yeah.

463
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,400
Hi, Sweetie.

464
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,200
Mom! Hi...

465
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,700
We wanted to have a little...

466
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
What's the matter?

467
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,700
I thought we could have a little chat
about our plans.

468
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,300
Mom...

469
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,600
- You know you're in a gay bar.
- That's what's so great.

470
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,800
It's very women-identified and...
by the way...

471
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,800
I'm Chris' Mom.

472
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,000
Are you gay?

473
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,800
Sorry!

474
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,800
What's wrong?

475
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,100
My lover left mer after 18 years
for some teenager who weighs 12 lb.

476
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
What am I going to do?

477
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,100
- God! That's just like me and Morty.
- Who?

478
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,600
Morty.

479
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,700
She's butch.

480
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,500
Nail Daddy and those
other low-lifes?

481
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,800
I don't mean "nail 'em".
I mean, just teach and help them.

482
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,800
- Vaporize them!
- Yeah, sure.

483
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,300
Yes! Yes! Yes!

484
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm in. I'm really in.

485
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
Elise...

486
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,200
Elise, Chris is in!

487
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Can you believe it? Mission
accomplished. We'd better go.

488
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,000
She's staying!

489
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
She's with me, babe!
Come on, honey, my place.

490
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,700
Brenda, you're so possessive!

491
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,400
Something I was just
thinking about...my resume.

492
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Wouldn't interfere with school.
Something part-time until I graduate.

493
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,100
Come on, Dad.
How about a little nepotism?

494
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,800
I'll hire you.

495
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,700
I'm surprised. You've never
shown interest in advertising.

496
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,100
I know, Daddy.
I'm here to learn.

497
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,400
That's great.

498
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,800
<i>Elise decided to pull the rug</i>
<i>out from under Bill...literally.</i>

499
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,600
<i>After all, his lawyer told her</i>
<i>to dispose of their common property.</i>

500
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Miss Eliot, you know
he hates interruptions.

501
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,400
Please let me
tell him you're here. Please...

502
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,700
Elise...what a kick!
But I'm on with the Coast.

503
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,200
All the good stuff goes.
The Lampico, the Ming vase.

504
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,700
Amari horsemen, Faberg?eggs, the
Wingback chair, the green Tiffany lamp.

505
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Babe...what's going on?

506
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,600
As requested, I'm consolidating
the matrimonial assets for liquidation.

507
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,300
That includes these antiques
I bought for you.

508
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,600
- You are the best.
- Love tokens, anniversary gifts.

509
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,200
- Junk. Here, take that desk too.
- Elise, this hurts me.

510
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,300
I care about you...about us.
About the magic.

511
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,500
- What exactly is going on here?
- And this Japanese secretary.

512
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,000
- I want that to go.
- Back off, Jacko!

513
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,400
Elise, this isn't right. It's hormonal.
You can't do this.

514
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,300
- Watch me!
- But this is my stuff!

515
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,800
It's the 90s, Bill. Downsize!

516

<i>At Jason's Bar Mitzvah</i>
<i>2 weeks later-</i>

517
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,300
<i>- First Wives Club</i>
<i>got its first big break.</i>

518
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,000
<i>Thanks to Brenda's dear,</i>

519

Uncle Carmine. My father's side.

520
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,400
Morty and I have planned for this day
since Jason was born.

521
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,500
- But Morty's going to be here.
- But next to me.

522
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,100
We're not a family anymore.

523
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,100
It's OK. I'll be fine.

524
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,600
Excuse me.

525
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,400
He brought her...

526
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,900
...to my son's Bar Mitzvah!

527
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,400
Is she a gift?

528
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,200
- Brenda, can I speak freely?
- Sure. Annie's cool.

529
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,900
I speak for the entire family and your
late father - my beloved brother -

530
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:53,100
- when I say Morty is garbage.
I'd be honored to take him out.

531
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,300
No, don't you dare. Morty the
Garbage is my problem.

532
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,100
I'll work it out myself.
Thanks for the thought anyway.

533
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,800
My angel.

534
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,500
For Morty to treat you this way after
what your father did for him...

535
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,100
Where would he be?

536
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,000
The first year of his business,
all his merchandise -

537
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,200
- fell off one of our trucks.

538
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,100
You're not serious?

539
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,600
We were happy
to help you newlyweds.

540
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,800
My Morty a crook?

541
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,200
Check his books.
They're fiction. Bestsellers!

542
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,100
<i>- Ciao.</i>
<i>- Ciao. Grazie.</i>

543
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,900
Really liked your uncle.

544
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,100
- Mother! Mother! Where are you?
- Over here, bitch.

545
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,300
Mother, I met a man. He's an angel.

546
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,400
He's a God. He's a doctor.

547
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,700
It's perfect.

548
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,600
- Do I really have the part?
- Baby, you know it.

549
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,700
Pizza!

550
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,900
- Oh my God!
- Elise!

551
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
- There's the Lichtenstein.
- What the hell are you doing?

552
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,700
- The Dine. Take that.
- This is so cool.

553
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
- All the gym equipment.
- I'm getting a restraining order.

554
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,200
No, Bill, this is great.
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.

555
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,000
I've seen all your movies
and I want to be just like you, only me!

556
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,600
Phoebe, some advice...
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

557
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,400
- Pheebs, she's bitter.
- And take the cappuccino machine!

558
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,600
Bill, I have a great idea.

559
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,700
Wouldn't she be great
to play opposite me?

560
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,900
Bill is producing this new,
incredible movie -

561
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,700
- with this young, hot director.
I'm the star of it.

562
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,800
- I'm Monique.
- What?

563
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,200
And you can be my Mom!

564

<i>loft and house in the Hamptons -</i>

<i>Brenda and I looked for an office.</i>
<i>A base for the Club.</i>

566
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,300
Come in.

567
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,100
Look at this.
It's early everything, huh.

568
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,100
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.

569
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,500
You know what it says?
"I beat Meryl."

570
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,300
- It does not. Put that down.
- Is there chocolate inside?

571
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,600
- Put it down!
- OK, OK.

572
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,400
Put it gently down.
Look. Do you believe this stuff?

573
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,300
I don't know where to put it.
There's no room in my warehouse.

574
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,800
I could have put it in my
building downtown.

575
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,800
- You own a building?
- Yeah, I do.

576
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,000
I sublet it normally, but...

577
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,700
...now it's...vacant.

578
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,500
There's a lot of work to be done.
You have to see it.

579
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,000
Look at this.

580
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,800
All right, this is perfect.

581
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,900
All right, girls!
This is fabulous.

582

586
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,000
- This is a great play!
- I told her she had to do it.

587
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,600
I don't want to do theater!
I haven't done theater in years!

588
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,700
Bill always said theater
was bad for my career...

589
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,100
- ...which actually I agree with.
- Excuse me, but this is a great role.

590
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,000
This is about a bitter, unloved,
emotionally barren woman.

591
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,700
- That's not me!
- It's you!

592

I'll sue you. I'll break you.

597
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,500

<i>- That's my car, you piece of plastic!</i>
- Oh, darn.

599
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,800
Bill... Lamborghini.

600
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,700
The Lamborghini.

601
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,200
He's mad. Whoo!

602
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,500
Elise, can I ask you a question?

603
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,400
Aren't you frustrated? You climb
and climb and go nowhere.

604
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,600
I love it! Burns off the booze.
You want to know something?

605
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,100
- I get my best ideas when I work out.
- You get ideas?!

606
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,500
It clears out my head. I think straight.
Everything makes sense.

607
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,800
Better start thinking because
we need Morty's books to prove fraud.

608
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,900
I know where they are!
Morty just bought Shelly a penthouse.

609
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,500
- Now, figure out how to get in.
- Duarto.

610
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,900
Shelly has a new apartment
that needs to be decorated.

611
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,900
Gunilla, I'd adore it.

612
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,300
<i>Enchante. Au revoir, jolie!</i>

613
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,900
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg personally
invited me to her society luncheon.

614
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,100
Why?

615
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:44,400
<i>Gunilla Goldberg was happy helping</i>
<i>us, she being a first wife herself.</i>

616
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,700
<i>Indeed, Gunilla was a 1st, 2nd, 3rd -</i>

617
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,500
<i>- and 4th wife, which accounted for</i>
<i>her very comfortable surroundings.</i>

618
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,800
This is delicious!
Usually I bring my own dressing.

619
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,000
That fat-free ranch stuff,
but this is restaurant quality.

620
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,100
- Thank you.
- Can I tell you something?

621
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,500
When I first got your call,
I said to Morty...

622
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,300
"This just feels so right."
Me and Gunilla.

623
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,900
I used to work for Morty
as his executive assistant.

624
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,900
He was married to that
nightmare then...Brenda -

625
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,800
- a completely class-free
dumpster woman.

626
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,400
I said to him: "Morty, you' ve got to
move on and move up."

627
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,900
Now, here I am! Taste Central.

628
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,800
The moment I saw you...my first
impression was she's someone...

629
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,100
See, that's what I told him.
But he doesn't get it.

630
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,700
- He doesn't get a lot of things.
- Are you finished?

631
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,000
- Yeah, I'm done.
- Take the fork.

632
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,200
Fork!

633
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:01,300
All you need to enter society
is some advice and a guiding hand.

634
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,500
Like what?

635
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,800
The correct florist
and the utterly ideal chef.

636
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,400
Of course, a decorator...of death.

637
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,600
Your house is your calling card.
It has to be perfected -

638
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,500
- photographed, published.

639
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,300
Can you really help me?
I would kill for that.

640
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:29,000
That's unnecessary.
Just two words: Duarto Feliz.

641
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,900
He is a genius. A gem!

642
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,100
Of course, he's impossible to get.
He works all the time.

643
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,200
Oh, my God!

644
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,600
There she is! Princess Pelvis.

645
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,200
- Gunilla says she went for it.
- Fabulous!

646
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,300
Johnny, let's go.

647
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,400
So, Duarto makes his move
and Shelly falls for it.

648
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,600
- Let's synchronize our watches.
- Just like "Mission Impossible".

649
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,800
- These people are always late.
- Shut up, Morty, and stay shut up.

650
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,500
- Take it easy.
- What if he doesn't like us?

651
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,200
- What are you worried about?
Go on, answer the bell.

652
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,500
- Okay!
- Fine.

653
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Hello!
Please, do come in.

654
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,600
It's an honor and beyond.

655
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg informs me
you are my new best friend.

656
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,700
- I hope!
- Duarto Feliz...And may I?

657
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,600
Please!

658
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,900
Extraordinary!

659
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,300
Interesting little touches everywhere.

660
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,500
- What?
- That chair is agony.

661
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,800
- Morty, do something!
- What?

662
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,400
- Just cover it up. Get rid of it!
-Take it easy.

663
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,000
It's his chair.
I didn't want that chair.

664
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,700
- It's covered.
- Thanks ever so much.

665
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,500
Now, then...

666
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,500
I feel...

667
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,100
You feel...

668
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Light...

669
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,400
- Get out.
- What?!

670
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,000
I need to be alone
in this space for an hour, at least.

671
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,600
It is very delicate.
I must bond.

672
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,900
- We understand.
- I must have total access.

673
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,200
- What is upstairs?
- That's just the office.

674
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,800
<i>Le office.</i>

675
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,400
Stay out of
<i>le office!</i>

676
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,600
- Leave me one hour.
- We understand.

677
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
One hour!
Thank you.

678
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,900
Bye bye.

679
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,200
Girls... Girls!
Come on, hurry.

680
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,300
- Ow, my knee, damn it.
- We don't have much time.

681
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:18,500
- Where are we going?
- Honey, don't worry about it.

682
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,800
Let's go in here.

683
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,300
Here we go!
In here.

684
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,500
Brenda!

685
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,300
There's an office upstairs.

686
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,200
There's an office upstairs!

687
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,400
- Let's go upstairs.
- Good girl!

688
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,000
I feel dizzy.

689
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
Annie, check the computer.
I'll check the files.

690
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,400
I need the key.
Where's the key?

691
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,000
- Hello!
<i>- Ready.</i>

692
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,000
Come on, tax returns.

693
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,600
What is this stuff?

694
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,800
Got 'em!

695
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Come on, hustle, Morty.

696
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,400
Social climbers on the rise.

697
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,900
Oh, God!

698
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,200
- They're back! They're back!
- Stall them.

699
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,400
- With what?
- Make something up. lmprovise.

700
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,100
- What's the matter with you?
- I can't improvise.

701
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,400
I'm putting
the files right in here.

702
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,200
Keep them away from the front door.

703
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,100
- I'm clean. I'm clean. I'm clean.
- Slap her. Slap her.

704
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,200
Hello!

705
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,300
I know you said an hour, but it's cold
today and I couldn't stay away.

706
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,900
- Tell me everything!
- How much?

707
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,900
I'll tell you what. We're going to
look out the living room windows.

708
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,600
Why? Because I'll tell you why.

709
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,400
Windows are the eyes of a room.

710
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,000
-So?
- Oh, Duarto.

711
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,400
The valance...
The valance is our eyebrows.

712
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,700
- The drapes are...
- I gotta pee.

713
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,900
You can't, you can't!

714
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,800
Where was l?
Oh, the drapes...are the eyelashes.

715
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,600
You said windows were eyelashes.

716
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,800
What do we do?
Where do we go?

717
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,500
The window. Come on.

718
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,300
What do we do now?

719
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,500
We'll get into this window
washing thing and ride it down.

720
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,100
- Annie...
- You gotta go down, honey.

721
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,200
- It's the only way out!
- I have a fear of everything.

722
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,000
- Come on, you're the new Annie.
- Annie, watch!

723
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm going in first.
I do all my own stunts.

724
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,400
Gimme the controls!

725
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,900
I can't do this!
I can't stand this!

726
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,200
Gotham's my inspiration.

727
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,800
The white of the snow
pelting the trees of Central Park.

728
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,800
The yellow of the taxis.
The blue...

729
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:19,300
But who cares about blue?
No one feels blue with my design.

730
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,800
- Forget about that.
- What about those drapes?

731
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,800
The window meeting is over.
It's time to consider the stairs.

732
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,400
- What about that dumb fountain?
- I rather like it.

733
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,800
I'd rather look at the window.

734
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,000
Oh, my God!

735
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,700
-Is that Elise Eliot?
- Elise, you look great!

736
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,900
You look great! !

737
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,600
You want to go again?

738
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,900
- Oh, my God!
- I've never been so petrified.

739
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,200
No, really, really...except for
that one time.

740
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,500
- I'm not going to tell you.
- Why not? We won't judge you.

741
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,500
We're your buddies. We cherish you.

742
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,700
We would never ever make fun of you.
Ever! Would we, hon?

743
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,800
- No, no.
- OK.

744
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:44,400
All right. You remember
Cynthia's 21st birthday?

745
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,300
Her parents rented that big hall.

746
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,200
We wanted to do
something special for her.

747
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,300
Elise thought we should be
the entertainment.

748
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,500
We were supposed
to sing to her like a girl group.

749
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,500
We sang that Leslie Gore song.
Remember? We were a big hit.

750
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,100
I hated it. I can't sing.
I was terrified before all those people.

751
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,300
I'd ratherjump off that building.

752
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,200
- You were wonderful.
- But it was for Cynthia.

753
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,500
I remember that.
We were a group.

754
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,600
We are a group!
We should do it and sing again.

755
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,100
- Let's do it again. I wanna sing.
- Why?

756
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,600
Why not? We'll blend.
We'll sing with you.

757
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,200
- We'll blend!
- All of us altogether, real loud, OK?

758
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,300
You're gonna sing with me, all right?

759
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,200
To Cynthia.
Happy birthday wherever you are.

760
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,500
All right, I'm ready.

761
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,700
- Go!
- Pick a note!

762
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,100
You don't own me!

763
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,300
I'm not just one of your many toys

764
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,800
You don't own me!
Don't say I can't go with other boys

765
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,100
And don't tell me what to do!

766
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,700
And don't tell me what to say!

767
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,500
I sound horrible.
I hate you for this.

768
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:17,600
<i>Hi, Mom, it's your little spy</i>
<i>at the ad agency.</i>

769
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,200
<i>I can't talk now,</i>
<i>but have I got news for you!</i>

770
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,000
<i>I think it's time you got back</i>
<i>into the ad business. Call me.</i>

771
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,200
<i>Bren? It's Annie. Listen to this.</i>
<i>Aaron's partners want to sell-</i>

772
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,800
<i>- their share of the ad agency.</i>
<i>I could buy it if I had the money.</i>

773
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,500
<i>Can you imagine?</i>
<i>God, Aaron would die.</i>

774
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:48,200
<i>It's Brenda. Annie needs a</i>
<i>down payment for an ad agency.</i>

775
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,100
<i>Any idea where</i>
<i>she can get the money?</i>

776
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,600
<i>So, Elise sold me Bill's things</i>
<i>at a very reasonable price.</i>

777
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,200
<i>And I put it all up for auction.</i>

778
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,700
Your sale has generated
a great deal of excitement.

779
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,600
I want to raise funds
for my organization.

780
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,500
However, some lots
may fail to sell.

781
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,700
I wouldn't worry about that.

782
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,400
At $380,000
for the Lichtenstein.

783
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,100
$380,000, selling then.
Fair warning of $380,000.

784
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,200
Paddle 3-7-2.

785
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,900
$380,000 for that?

786
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,100
Lot 55 is the Louis <i>chaise canape</i>
showing here on my left....

787
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,300
And I have $45,000
on the telephone.

788
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,100
- It's gorgeous.
- Fabulous.

789
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,800
Absolutely sublime.

790
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,500
It doesn't look very comfy.
Morty likes his recliner.

791
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,800
...in place now at $ 48,000.
$50,000 at the desk now.

792
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,000
$50,000...$55,000.
The lady's bid up front now.

793
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,800
My God, did you see who bid?
That's Elise Eliot.

794
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,300
She has impeccable
taste...for an actress.

795
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,400
Fair warning then at $55,000.

796
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,400
- It's a fabulous <i>chaise.</i>
- I don't know.

797
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,100
That sofa? <i>Architectural Digest.</i>
The cover!

798
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,400
- Really?
- You? Guaranteed!

799
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,400
$60,000 this side!
New bidder now at $60,000.

800
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,200
Lot is yours, madam, at $60,000.

801
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,800
You, madam, $60,000.

802
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,800
- I got a <i>chaise.</i>
- Beautiful!

803
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,000
Lot 57, the fine Yung Che charger
showing here and $90,000 to start.

804
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,300
$90,000 is bid. Thank you, sir.
$90,000...$100,000!

01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,500
New bidder now, $110,000.
The lady's bid here now.

806
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,300
$115,000. Thank you, sir.
$115,000.

807
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,400
- It's cute.
- It's sublime.

808
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,300
- Essential!
- Oxygen!

809
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,500
$125,000.
The lady's bid now at 125.

810
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,900
Need a new face now.
$125,000 up front.

811
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,800
- $130,000. New bidder up front.
- Elise Eliot must be very rich.

812
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,100
- Show business.
- Teach her a lesson. Come on.

813
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,900
At $130,000. 130...
$135,000 at the back!

814
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,200
New bidder now.
$135,000.

815
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,300
$135,000.
Lady's bid at the back.

816
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,900
- Who is she? She looks familiar.
- Just someone glamorous.

817
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,800
Some Euro-trash. Shelly, you
can't let that plate leave the US.

818
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,700
- It's Japanese.
- Don't they have enough?

819
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:29,500
$135,000. The bidder's here
at the back at $135,000.

820
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,000
Lady's bid at the back at $135,000.

821
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,900
It's yours now at $135,000

822
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,300
Bidder's here at the back.

823
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,200
- Go ahead!
<i>- Aber gehen Sie!</i>

824
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,000
Jackie O had one just like it.

825
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,700
$140,000 up front now.
$140,000...

826
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,400
...against you at the back, madam.

827
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,700
$140,000...$140,000.

828
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,700
For you, madam, paddle 560.

829
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,300
Thank you, thank you.

830
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:12,600
Shelly, what happened here?
$140,000 for a plate?

831
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,300
$47,000 for a carpet?
A used carpet?

832
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,800
$300,000 for a Lamborghini?
Are you crazy?

833
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,900
I bought the car for you.
It was only 300 grand. It was a gift.

834
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,200
With my money you bought it!
I bought me the gift!

835
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,600
Jesus, I want a lifestyle!

836
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,000
With some ambiance and some
classic, eternal good taste.

837
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,200
But not for $300,000, Shelly!

838
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,500
I can leave if you like.

839
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,800
It's not like you've
asked me to marry you.

840
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,000
Would you...

841
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,100
...unzip me?

842
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Thank you.

843
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:09,700
Shel, I lost my temper. I'm sorry.
The Lamborghini is a very good deal.

844
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,900
- Hi, Jase. How was the game?
- Knicks lose again.

845
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,100
Every player on that team is
a millionaire. They can't really lose.

846
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,500
- What do you think?
- That's not new, is it?

847
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,200
It's better than new.
It's the first time it's fit me in 3 years.

848
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,700
Look at me!
I have a waist, legs... Who knew?

849
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,500
How's your father?
Did you have fun?

850
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,600
- Yeah, but don't let that bother you.
- What a thing to say!

851
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,700
Jason, look. I remember how great
it was when we were a family.

852
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,900
Even though we're not together now,
you still have both of us.

853
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,700
You guys can't even pick out
my birthday card without a lawyer.

854
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Jason, I know you worry
about your father.

855
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,000
He's a very good man.

856
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:04,300
He's a very good,
very confused man.

857
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,500
But you don't have to
worry about me -

858
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,200
- because I'm going to be fine.
I'm lightening up, literally.

859
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:17,300
And you know what?
Your father and I love you to pieces.

860
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,600
- There, did I embarrass you?
- Almost.

861
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,300
You want to go to a movie?
Me and you?

862
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,200
- Together...in public?
- Mom, I'm sorry.

863
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:34,000
I was a little freaked out
by Dad getting engaged to Shelly.

864
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,500
Oh, well... I can see how
that would rip your heart out.

865
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,800
Thanks, Mom.

866
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,700
We gotta nail Bill.

867
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,400
We gotta...slaughter him.

868
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,600
Right off the face of the planet.

869
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,800
Him and that tramp. That infant.

870
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,300
- I need a drink.
- Holy moly, she's loaded.

871
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,900
I know. I'm really worried.
She had me look at Bill's records -

872
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,100
- and the guy's a saint.
He's clean.

873
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,500
- He's a saint with a great lawyer.
- What?

874
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:34,500
Are you saying
you can't find anything on him?

875
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,400
- I'm really sorry. I'll look again.
- This isn't fair.

876
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,900
Aaron's going to be massacred.
Morty's won't know what hit him -

877
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,300
- and Bill's just gonna walk away.
With alimony!

878
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,200
We'll keep trying, Elise.

879
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:53,000
You'd better keep trying because
this is my life and my money!

880
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,500
What do you know?
You don't get it. You're civilians.

881
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,700
You're just housewives.

882
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
- That's it!
- No, wait.

883
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,900
You'll never understand.

884
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,000
Gimme that.
Excuse me. Give that back.

885
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,200
I say this with love compassion
and true sisterhood.

886
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,800
You are full of shit!

887
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,500
What?

888
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,100
OK, alimony sucks.

889
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,200
OK, you didn't get to play
a policewoman in a Wonderbra.

890
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,900
But you grew up gorgeous.

891
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,400
Thanks to Cher's pioneering efforts,
you still haven't hit puberty.

892
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,600
Once you were a terrific actress.

893
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,600
You even got an Oscar to prove it.

894
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,500
You spent your whole life
with people sucking up to you.

895
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:36,800
I'm sure Annie agrees with me that
your perception of life is a bit altered.

896
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,700
- Annie, do you agree with her?
- Come on!

897
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,900
Brenda, she's very upset.

898
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,700
- Two pinheads!
- Wait a minute.

899
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,900
You've got some nerve.

900
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,200
I drink because I'm a sensitive
and highly strung person.

901
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,600
No! That's why your co-stars drink!

902
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,600
I am not a drunk!

903
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,100
Really?
Let's examine the evidence.

904
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,800
Look, all bottles!

905
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,300
And gallon jugs.

906
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,300
- I had guests.
- Who? Guns 'N' Roses?

907
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,100
Come on, you two.

908
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,300
The enemy's out there, not in here,
and we are best friends!

909
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,100
After all those years,
you never called me.

910
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,200
- You were unlisted!
- You always gossip behind my back.

911
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,800
- You deserve it!
- You didn't invite me...

912
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,000
- ...to your son's Bar Mitzvah.
- You wouldn't have come.

913
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,000
- Yeah, it was in Hebrew.
- Oh, shut up!

914
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,000
You think a movie star
doesn't have feelings.

915
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,800
You're wrong!
I do have feelings.

916
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,600
I'm an actress!
I have all of them.

917
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:42,000
I wouldn't understand. I'm just a
housewife and a child to raise.

918
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,500
You were always jealous of me 'cause
I was blonde, beautiful and talented.

919
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:50,000
- And I could have any guy I wanted.
- And did! Every guy!

920
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,700
Most of the senior class
and half the faculty.

921
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,300
It was the 1960s.

922
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,200
Look at this place.
Is this where your fan club meets?

923
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,400
Do you have ritual sacrifices?

924
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,800
Put that down!

925
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,900
- I won that!
- I remember.

926
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,400
- Your first "talkie".
- What did you ever win?

927
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:10,200
A pie-eating contest?
Best Ingestion.

928
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,600
Oh, no...

929
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,500
Brenda!

930
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,700
This is a Golden Globe.

931
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,300
It's sacred!

932
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,800
It's...trademarked!

933
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,700
- Are you crazy?
- Stop it. Both of you!

934
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,200
Annie. You choose!
Who's your friend? Me or Brenda?

935
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,000
For once, make a decision.
Who's your buddy?

936
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,800
Some Beverly Hills science project...

937
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,200
...or a woman with her own aisle
at the supermarket.

938
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,900
I'm sorry,
but I'm not getting involved with this.

939
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,300
You both have severe
psychological problems.

940
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,300
I'm... I'm the nice one here.
I'm not like this.

941
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,000
- What?
- Yes.

942
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,100
- The nice one?
- Well, I mean I...

943
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,700
- You mean the rag mop, don't ya?
- Excuse me!

944
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,700
The one who can't manage
a simple declarative sentence!

945
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,100
The wimp! The wuss!

946
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,800
Well...I changed.
I'm much stronger than I used to be.

947
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,600
You are self-righteous!
You pipsqueek.

948
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,600
Shut up, you arthritic sex kitten.

949
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,200
- Shut up, Morty's girl.
- Monique's mom!

950
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,600
Stop it!
You're both selfish assholes.

951
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,600
- Oh, my face! Oh, my God.
- That is enough.

952
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,400
Have we forgotten
what we're doing here?

953
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,800
What has happened to us?

954
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:35,900
We're supposed to help each other,
not rip each other to shreds.

955
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,100
She's right.

956
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,500
You know, I gotta say
I always wondered -

957
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,800
- how drunk Cynthia was
when she decided -

958
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,000
- to do a jackknife onto Park Ave.

959
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,000
- Mom.
- What's wrong? I came right over.

960
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,200
Things are not working out
the way I planned.

961
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,600
And you called me?

962
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,700
Oh, my God!

963
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,700
I don't know.
It's just completely falling apart.

964
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,700
We're at each other's throats.

965
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,600
It's like it's all my fault.
I'm just useless.

966
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,100
- You are not!
- Honey, I am.

967
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:12,100
The past few weeks you've been
a totally different person.

968
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,500
You've stopped apologizing
for yourself all the time.

969
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,400
I know. I'm sorry, honey.

970
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,600
This First Wives Club thing
can't work and it never could.

971
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,900
You make it work. It can.
You can make it work.

972
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,000
Call Brenda and Elise.

973
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,000
I can't call them.
What will I say to them?

974
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,500
This is just...
I should have seen this.

975
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,200
I should've seen this coming.

976
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,300
I know.
Why not write each of them a note!

977
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,500
Or maybe send a hanging plant.

978
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,400
Just a suggestion.

979
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,500
No, Mom.

980
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,600
No, it's over. It's over.

981
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
Brenda?

982
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,800
I don't want to be like Cynthia.

983
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,600
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

984
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,500
Come on in.

985
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:31,200
- I've never been to your apartment.
- I know.

986
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,100
- Annie!
- Annie!

987
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,600
Annie, what are you doing?

988
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,200
Elise, it's your loft.

989
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,100
I'm storing some things
or I'll burn them if you want.

990
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,700
- But why?
- Why? Are you kidding?

991
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,700
We've completely
embarrassed ourselves.

992
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,200
We've become exactly what
the world thinks we are.

993
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,800
And our ex-husbands!
We are "The Three Witches".

994
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,500
Witches?
Well, I'll tell you something!

995
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,200
- Witches have powers.
- What?

996
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,800
They do!
They've powers for good <i>and</i> evil.

997
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,400
Brenda and I are OK now.

998
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:12,100
We've figured out what
we <i>think</i> we know what we want.

999
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,100
I know what went wrong.
The whole crackpot idea went wrong.

1000
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,700
Revenge and egos...
Thinking we could fix our silly lives.

1001
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,700
- Exactly! We were thinking too small.
- What are you talking about?

1002
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,800
We were trying to get back
at our ex's, which is a start -

1003
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,700
- but it isn't enough.
It's so petty and limited!

1004
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,300
No wonder
we're snarling at each other.

1005
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,700
No wonder we're
at each other's throats. Listen!

1006
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,100
We have to take our plan
and expand it.

1007
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,100
First thing, we take care of
our own guys -

1008
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,600
- because they really
have it coming. Then...we go global!

1009
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,300
How?

1010
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,000
Are you interested
because I'll tell you.

1011
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,600
I don't know if I'm interested.

1012
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,200
What if we erupt again?

1013
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,300
Or Elise, what if you start drinking,
and, Brenda, you start sniping?

1014
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,900
- Been there!
- Done that!

1015
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,800
- It's not enough for me.
- Annie...

1016
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,700
Take a good look at Elise.
Look at her!

1017
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,500
I'm sober.
And I'm going to do the play.

1018
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
- Really?
- I'll be there front row opening night.

1019
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,200
Our friendship is everything.
Don't leave.

1020
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,200
We can't fall apart now.

1021
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,100
But even if we want to,
we don't have enough information.

1022
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,300
Of course, we do have stuff
on Aaron and Morty.

1023
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,400
But what about Bill?
We're still on square one.

1024
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:21,700
No, not exactly.
I admit all he's done so far is legal...

1025
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,100
...as far as he knows.

1026
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,900
- What do you mean?
- It's all a question of angles.

1027
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,400
- Are you in?
- Are you back?

1028
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,000
- Talk.
- Well... After you.

1029
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:46,000
I'm seriously thinking of taking
the role of Monique's Mom.

1030
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,000
And I've been thinking
about who she is -

1031
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:55,100
- what she's about. I'm sure you're
doing the same thing with Monique.

1032
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,100
Sure. I've been thinking like,
streaks...

1033
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,000
...just around my face.

1034
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,800
Oh!

1035
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,900
And what a beautiful face.

1036
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,700
Anyway, the reason I called is
if we're going to work together -

1037
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,100
- I think we should get to
know one another.

1038
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,700
It's important.

1039
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,600
Bill is so wrong.

1040
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,200
- You are not Satan.
- Oh, stop!

1041
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,200
Do you need a TV or a VCR
or a personal computer?

1042
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,000
Who's the first name in top quality -

1043
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,800
- low-cost appliances?

1044
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,400
Let's ask this beautiful
young lady here.

1045
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,700
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Why, hello!

1046
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

1047
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:46,300
I'm in the market for a
low-quality, top-cost appliance.

1048
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,200
- Cut!
- Shelly.

1049
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,000
Top-quality, low-cost.

1050
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,600
- Morton Cushman.
- Yeah, why?

1051
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,200
You have the right to remain silent.

1052
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,000
What's going on here?
I'm shooting a commercial.

1053
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,600
Federal Marshals
acting on behalf of the IRS.

1054
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,200
Bobby, call my lawyer.

1055
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,900
<i>On November 28th,</i>
<i>at exactly 1400 hours -</i>

1056
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,400
<i>- Operation Hell's Fury</i>
<i>swung into action.</i>

1057
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,900
- Morning.
- Hi.

1058
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,800
- How's my day shaping up?
- Poor Daddy, it's going to be hell.

1059
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,400
Your 9 o'clock's waiting
in the conference room.

1060
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,900
Okie-dokie.

1061
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,200
So, where do I stand here now?

1062
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,100
We'll also bill the expenses
including but not limited to...

1063
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,400
What is this?

1064
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,500
Miss Eliot. Please...

1065
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,600
- I'm begging you. Please.
- Brett, we love the new draft...

1066
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,500
Phoebe's crazy about it.
She's going to read it.

1067
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,300
Elise, I'm trying
to make a movie here.

1068
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,700
- Hold your calls.
- That was an important phonecall.

1069
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,200
- Where's my first check?
- Just sit down and shut up! OK?

1070
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,400
Now, let's take a meeting.

1071
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,900
- Hello, Sunshine!
- Welcome.

1072
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,700
This is kidnaping.

1073
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,500
I will crucify you.

1074
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,700
You want to talk crucifixion?

1075
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,900
Happy Easter, Morty.

1076
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,900
- Big deal!
- Letters from Brenda's father...

1077
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,000
...about stocking your stores
with stolen merchandise.

1078
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,800
- What do they call it in the tabloids?
- "Hot stuff".

1079
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,400
Criminal activity.
You should be ashamed.

1080
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,300
Wake up and smell the audit.

1081
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,400
Aaron, I just had
a little talk with Erik and Marc.

1082
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,300
It seems the business
is very dysfunctional.

1083
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,800
Sort of like our marriage.

1084
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,700
So...

1085
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,500
I bought them out.

1086
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,600
What?

1087
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,100
- Yeah, I think we ought to go.
- That's a good idea.

1088
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,000
- Goodbye, Erik.
- Good luck to you.

1089
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,600
- Annie
- Oh, Marc.

1090
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,400
- Love ya.
- I do love that suit.

1091
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,300
You couldn't possibly pull off
something like this.

1092
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,900
Where did you get
this kind of money?

1093
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,300
As agreed, I sold our assets
to a friend of mine.

1094
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,600
Here's your half.

1095
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,100
Fifty cents?

1096
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,600
Considering our history together,
I thought a dollar was very fair.

1097
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:08,900
Oh, all right!
Take it all.

1098
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,200
- What do you want? Money?
- Every cent.

1099
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,000
You're out of your mind.

1100
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,000
You can hand it over and live
happily ever after.

1101
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,700
You can give it to the government
and get 10 to 20.

1102
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,700
Maybe Duarto can do your cell.

1103
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:23,300
I see...bars.

1104
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,300
You can't do this to me.

1105
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,500
- But I have done it.
- You wouldn't.

1106
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,800
You...couldn't.

1107
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,300
It seems I could and I did.

1108
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:37,100
You know what, Aaron?
I forgot how much fun work can be.

1109
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,800
If you take my agency from me,
I'll walk.

1110
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,700
- I'll take my clients with me.
- Be my guest.

1111
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,400
I'm not kidding!
I will take every single account.

1112
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,400
This place without me....

1113
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,100
- It would be worthless.
- I don't think so, babe.

1114
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,600
Not after the new
$45,000,000 account I just landed.

1115
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,800
New account?
What account?

1116
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,000
Morty's Electronics will be
under my control.

1117
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,800
Advertising, marketing strategy...
Everything!

1118
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:11,000
You will stay on as President,
because after all...you are Morty.

1119
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,600
You will receive a salary which will
keep you in the lifestyle -

1120
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,300
- to which <i>I</i> think <i>you</i> should
become accustomed.

1121
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:22,200
I don't see what else you can do.
It's this orjail.

1122
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,900
So I dumped you for another woman.
Get over it!

1123
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,600
Lift something. Wax something.
Have something peeled.

1124
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,100
You're right!
I hate to admit it, but I'm jealous.

1125
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,600
Miss Lavelle is absolutely gorgeous.
She's a bright new star.

1126
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,000
lnterested, Elise?
Want to drink her blood?

1127
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:43,700
How old is she, Bill? 25? 26?

1128
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,400
- 21.
- Yeah.

1129
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,600
In about five years!
She's 16.

1130
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,800
- What?
- Two years ago...

1131
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,300
...she left high school
in Newkirk, Idaho.

1132
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,700
Should've done your homework, Bill.
I did.

1133
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,200
- A copy of her birth certificate.
- Oh, God. I didn't know.

1134
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,200
My God!
What are you going to do?

1135
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,200
What am I going to do?

1136
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:20,300
Right now, I'm just using the "f" word.
Felony!

1137
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,200
I think we should continue
this discussion in my office.

1138
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,300
In your office?
Is that all you can do?

1139
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,000
Think of yourself, yourself, yourself!

1140
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,700
If you go through with this,
I'll have nothing.

1141
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,600
Everyone in town is looking
for the new guy.

1142
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,100
How can I compete?

1143
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,100
Who else is going to want me?
I'm 46 years old.

1144
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,100
I'd have to start from scratch.

1145
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,800
I know just how you feel.

1146
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,300
Oh, Aaron...

1147
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,400
Grow from love.

1148
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,300
Annie McDuggan
FIRST WIVES CLUB

1149
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,900
I don't hate you. I wish I could.
But you're still kind of cute -

1150
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:07,700
- for a overbearing, cradle-robbing
Spandex-sucking criminal.

1151
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,900
So, I'm not going to take
all your money.

1152
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,800
Don't misunderstand.
I'm going to take plenty.

1153
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,300
And I'm going to hang onto these
because I have a favor to ask.

1154
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,800
Be there in two hours!

1155
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,900
While we were married,
I helped you.

1156
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,200
Now it's your turn to help others.

1157
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,400
- Where are you going?
- To see Barbara Walters.

1158
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,300
- Oh, my God!
- Scared?

1159
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,200
You won't talk about this,
will you?

1160
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,700
That depends on you.

1161
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,300
Be there at that address
in two hours, babe!

1162
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,500
<i>What Brenda meant by</i>
<i>thinking globally-</i>

1163
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,400
<i>- was that it wasn't enough</i>
<i>to make our ex-husbands suffer.</i>

1164
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,800
<i>To do the truly charitable,</i>
<i>unselfish thing -</i>

1165
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,800
<i>- we'd have to make them</i>
<i>suffer over and over again.</i>

1166
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,100
- So, what are you guys in for?
- Gentlemen!

1167
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,900
And Daddy.

1168
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:11,700
Honey...what's going on?
I can't handle more surprises today.

1169
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,500
Oh, Daddy...

1170
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,900
I'm a lesbian...

1171
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,300
A big one.

1172
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,700
Gentlemen, we've brought you
here today for a specific reason.

1173
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,400
This is not about
retaliation or negotiation -

1174
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,200
- and this is not about
men versus women.

1175
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,700
What is it then?
I'm sick of this, OK.

1176
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:45,600
- Please don't make her mad.
- No, no, this is not a revenge thing.

1177
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
This is about justice.

1178
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,100
Halfway through this operation
we realized -

1179
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:55,100
- the only people who'd be
helped by revenge would be us.

1180
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,600
- We'd be no better than you.
- Happier but no better.

1181
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,100
Exhilarated but no better!
Ecstatic but no better!

1182
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,700
So we thought again.

1183
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,800
A very dear friend of ours
died from neglect.

1184
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:10,100
You're going to help us make
sure that never happens again.

1185
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,700
- Like hell we are.
- Can't make us.

1186
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,200
No... but Vito can. Joey can.

1187
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,800
And Uncle Carmine can.

1188
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,900
- What do we have to do?
- You have to pay.

1189
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,200
<i>The funny thing was when we finally</i>
<i>had our ex's just where we wanted -</i>

1190
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,000
<i>- revenge didn't seem so important.</i>

1191
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:10,500
<i>So, we came up</i>
<i>with something better.</i>

1192
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:19,200
It's an important day here
in New York City for all women -

1193
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,100
- at the opening of the Cynthia Griffin
Crisis Center for Women.

1194
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,900
It's an amazing facility and I'm
here talking to three amazing women.

1195
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,600
Please tell me about your facility.

1196
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:36,600
This center is dedicated in memory
to our very dear friend Cynthia Swann.

1197
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,600
We plan on offering counseling -

1198
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,900
- family therapy and, of course,
abuse intervention for all.

1199
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,800
So many women are
in need here in Manhattan.

1200
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:51,600
Can I ask whether it's true that the
idea for this center started because -

1201
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,300
- each of you had a husband
that left you for a younger woman?

1202
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,000
Yes, yes.

1203
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,300
They really are amazing women.
Good for you!

1204
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,600
Congratulations for all the great work.
New York thanks you.

1205
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,700
I'm asking you as a favor.
Come in for one minute with me.

1206
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:20,200
- We have to talk about the wedding.
- What are you talking about?

1207
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,200
- You won't even set a date.
- Exactly.

1208
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,300
Because this isn't working.
I am not feeling special.

1209
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,400
I am not feeling loved.
And now this place.

1210
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,600
Morty, I am not Brenda.

1211
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,800
- No, you're not!
- Duh!

1212
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,300
Ivana...

1213
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,900
I want to thank you
for coming so much.

1214
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,900
- You're an angel.
- Of course, Elise.

1215
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,600
Thank you so much again.

1216
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:17,100
Ladies, you have to be strong
and independent.

1217
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,200
- And remember?
- What?

1218
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,900
Don't get mad.
Get everything!

1219
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,600
- Mrs. Goldberg?
- Yes.

1220
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,500
Carmine Morelli...
Brenda's uncle.

1221
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,800
- Yes, of course.
- Nice to meet you.

1222
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:49,200
What a wonderful occasion!
Helping people through a buffet!

1223
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,900
- Mom, it's a great party.
- Thank you, sweetie.

1224
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:56,900
You know, Annie,
this place is terrific.

1225
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:01,100
I think you did the right thing,
divorcing Aaron.

1226
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,400
I salute you.

1227
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,100
I have something to add.

1228
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:09,500
Annie, you're not
getting any younger. Or thinner.

1229
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,600
- You know what I think you need?
- No.

1230
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,900
Absolutely nothing!

1231
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:22,300
Baby...
Sweetheart!

1232
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,700
Come on, Jason.
Just one time around the floor.

1233
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:36,600
- Come on. Get real.
- I'm your mother. I command you.

1234
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,600
You gotta have something
to tell your shrink.

1235
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,200
Look at this.
Isn't this fantastic? I'm so proud.

1236
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,800
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Morty.

1237
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,200
Dad, save me.
She's trying to dance with me.

1238
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,900
Leave him alone.
He's a good kid.

1239
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,900
- I know that.
- Not like his Dad.

1240
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,400
- What?
- I'm getting out of the line of fire.

1241
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,700
- You look good, Bren.
- You too.

1242
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,300
- Thank you.
- Where's Shel?

1243
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,100
- In the car.
- Glove compartment?

1244
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,800
Trunk.

1245
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,800
Let me ask you a question.

1246
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,400
Was I this old
when we were married?

1247
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,800
Yes. But I liked you this old.

1248
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,800
Me too.

1249
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,800
- Wanna?
- Sure.

1250
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:57,400
<i>It was clear that Brenda and Morty</i>
<i>were headed for a reconciliation.</i>

1251
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,400
<i>Elise was dating an actor</i>
<i>in her hit play.</i>

1252
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,100
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>Aaron and Dr. Rosen split up.</i>

1253
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,300
<i>He wants to come home again</i>
<i>and he feels emotionally ready-</i>

1254
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,800
<i>- to recommit to an equitable</i>
<i>and caring relationship.</i>

1255
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,500
<i>I told him to drop dead.</i>

1256
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,000
- Excuse me, got a light?
- Sure.

1257
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,400
- Nice car. Used to have one myself.
- Thanks.

1258
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:35,500
So, what's going on in there? Is it just
lot of battered women dancing?

1259
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,400
Yeah, sort of.
Not really my scene.

1260
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,400
Me, neither.

1261
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
So, you here with anybody?

1262
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,000
- Not really.
- How old are you?

1263
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:55,400
Look at this place.
It's just a total mess.

1264
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:59,600
- But a gorgeous mess.
- You know, I can't believe it.

1265
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,300
We actually did it.
We accomplished it together.

1266
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,800
I know. We did it.

1267
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:10,500
Oh, God,
I wish Cynthia was here.

1268
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,300
She is...
She is in a way.

1269
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,900
OK, we're 1990s women.
What is it we really, really need?

1270
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,700
- You are never going to change.
- And I hope not.

1271
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,900
I hope we never change
and we always stay the same...

1272
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:28,300
Tired and happy.

1273
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,600
- Maybe a little bit brave.
- Brave?

1274
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:34,900
- You mean, "brave".
- What do you mean?

1275
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,900
- You don't own me
-You're not funny!

1276
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:41,700
No way. I'm out.

1277
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,400
Stop it! No, I'm not gonna...

1278
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,700
- You don't own me
- Leave me alone.

1279
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,400
Don't say I can't go
with other boys

1280
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,800
And don't tell me what to do

1281
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,600
And don't tell me what to say

1282
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,600
And when I go out with you

1283
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,200
Don't put me on display

1284
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:13,000
- Pretty good!
- You remembered!

1285
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:18,300
You don't own me!
Don't try to change me in any way

1286
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,100
You don't own me

1287
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,400
Don't tie me down
'cause I'll never stay

1288
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,600
I don't tell you what to say

1289
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,500
I don't tell you what to do

1290
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,500
So just let me be myself

1291
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,200
That's all I ask of you

1292
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,900
I'm young and I love to be young

1293
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,800
I'm free and I love to be free

1294
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,600
To live my life the way that I want

1295
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,500
To say and do whatever I please
