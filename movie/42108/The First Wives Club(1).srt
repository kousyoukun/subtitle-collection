00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,462
Middlebury College, 1969,
the year of walking on the moon -

3
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,590
- "Yellow Submarine"
and Woodstock.

4
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,512
Also the year that Pope Paul the VI
eliminated 200 saints. Amen.

5
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:29,726
And I, along wlth my three best
friends, graduated from college.

6
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:34,105
Where's Cynthia? We've got
to get going. I mean, shouldn't we?

7
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:37,525
Calm down, Annie.
She said she had a surprise.

8
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,945
How is this?
Is this heaven?

9
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:45,993
Elise, you are so gorgeous. Really!
Oh, my. It's lovely.

10
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:49,121
- It's solid.
- Oh, girls.

11
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,832
- Cynthia.
- Here. Open. Put them on.

12
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,835
Oh, my God!

13
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:59,006
Oh, my God.
You shouldn't have done this.

14
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,676
- It's too much.
- I don't think so. It's just enough.

15
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:05,888
You'll all write me nice notes,
but now we need a toast.

16
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,224
- Got it.
- Pour, pour! It's picture time.

17
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:12,270
- Champagne!
- From my folks.

18
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:15,690
To Annie, Elise and Brenda.

19
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,401
And Cynthia,
I mean our valedictorian.

20
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,863
All right. We're all bound together
forever by friendship and love.

21
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:23,406
And jewelry!

22
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:27,577
And we're always going
to be there for each other.

23
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:32,499
- Oh, God! I'm gonna cry!
- Here! For the rest of our lives.

24
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,793
- One, two, three...
- How's my hair?

25
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:36,336
It's good.

26
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,473
Mrs. Cynthia?

27
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:30,059
Teresa...

28
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,230
- I want you to have these.
- No, no, no.

29
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,773
-Yes, yes, yes.
- I cannot take...

30
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:39,527
- You just think of it as a raise, OK?
- Thank you.

31
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:42,363
Now, you take the rest of the day off.
Go on.

32
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:47,160
- Thank you.
- Would you mind mailing these?

33
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,884
Of the four of us, Cynthia was
certainly the most likely to succeed.

34
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,013
When she decided to do something -

35
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,808
- she just went ahead and did it.

36
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:02,529
Roachie. Come on, honey.
It's Mommy. Mommy's home.

37
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,406
Gosh, think we got any messages?

38
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,076
- What do you think, huh?
- Annie, dear, it's your mother.

39
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:12,665
It's 6am. Please call me urgently.

40
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:16,085
Chris!...Honey, I thought you
were going to campus yesterday.

41
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:20,381
My classes were cancelled.
I slept here. Where were you?!

42
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,466
I was... I was at a friend's.

43
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:26,930
You were with that man again.
Mother, I am so disappointed.

44
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,224
I'm sorry, but he is your father.

45
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:32,060
He's using you.
You shouldn't let him.

46
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:38,316
It's not that simple.
The truth is I love your father.

47
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,111
- I'm sure he loves me.
- You're a doormat!

48
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,822
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so crabby today?

49
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,450
Is it school?.. I know what it is.

50
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:51,747
- It's a boy.
- I'm a lesbian, mom.

51
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:54,667
I'm a lesbian.
But that's not the issue here.

52
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:57,712
- When you say "lesbian"...
- Don't tell Daddy.

53
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,340
I want to tell him myself when the time
is right. Like Father's Day.

54
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:02,925
- Or Christmas morning.
- Chris...

55
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:05,511
Thank God, you're all right.

56
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,513
Where were you?
Who saw you?

57
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:10,433
- Who saw me what?
- She was sleeping with Daddy.

58
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,481
Muffin, you've come
to your senses. I'm so happy.

59
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,778
Mother, I don't sleep with Aaron.
He has problems with his partners.

60
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:25,323
He's very conflicted, and he
needed somebody to talk to.

61
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,534
- Doormat!
- Lesbian.

62
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:36,585
Do it, Morris.
Do it to me now. I need it.

63
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:40,964
You're the only one who does it
the way I like it. You're the king.

64
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:45,053
Any more collagen, your lips will look
like they were stuck in a pool drain.

65
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:48,264
I haven't worked in 18 months.

66
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,435
I have a meeting with a director
for a part I would kill for.

67
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:56,397
- I have to look sexy.
- Elise, you are sexy!

68
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:59,859
Look at yourself. You're incredible.
You're my masterpiece.

69
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:03,488
- There's not one line on your face.
- Really? What do you call that?

70
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:07,450
- And these? What are these?
- You're 45.

71
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,912
One more facelift,
you'll be able to blink your lips.

72
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:14,124
- Don't you want to play your age?
- My own age?!

73
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,837
You don't understand. There are only
three ages for women in Hollywood:

74
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:22,591
Babe, district attorney
and "Driving Miss Daisy".

75
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,179
And right now, I want to be young.
Science Fiction "young"!

76
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:32,059
This is good. Maybe you should
also cut down on the booze.

77
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,150
I know you're upset about the divorce.

78
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,444
- Upset?
- You're upset about Bill's movie.

79
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:46,032
This isn't about him!
This is about my lips! Look at me.

80
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:49,786
I want Tina Turner. I want Jagger.

81
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:52,497
Fill 'em up.

82
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:59,796
Really? This is fabulous news.
Thank you. Bye... Jason!

83
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,049
Jason! Honey!

84
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,304
Yoo-hoo! "Burning Sensation"
just confirmed.

85
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,306
Jason!

86
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,683
- What?
- "Burning Sensation" confirmed.

87
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,977
- I got the band you wanted.
- Cool!

88
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:16,271
Affection!

89
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,026
Gimme that!

90
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,781
- What is this?
- Hebrew!

91
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,201
Your Bar Mitzvah's in 3 weeks...
the one thing your father will pay for.

92
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,079
- Learn it!
- Mom!

93
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:34,748
Don't "but, Mom" me! Learn it.
Don't shame me in the synagogue.

94
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:40,255
The separation from Aaron is absurd.

95
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,674
How will you fix things
if you're not together?

96
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:46,720
We're practically together.
We're seeing the same therapist.

97
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,390
- What?
- Her name is Dr. Leslie Rosen.

98
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:55,479
She's incredible. She helps
Aaron with commitment issues.

99
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:58,190
We're working on my self-esteem.

100
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,112
You're married with a daughter.
You're happy. Who needs self-esteem!

101
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:05,907
Mother!

102
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,826
Dr. Rosen says that...

103
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:11,954
She says you're very controlling.

104
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,373
Me? Controlling?

105
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,458
That is ridiculous.

106
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:19,045
- Mother, I...
- Roach...

107
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:21,339
Go!

108
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,135
What if I found somebody else,
mother? It's possible.

109
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,935
You're 46. You're more likely
to be slaughtered by a psycho.

110
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:36,896
Cynthia Swann Griffin is dead. The
former wife of Wall Street wizard...

111
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,608
Didn't you go to school with her?

112
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,568
...jumped from her
fashionable penthouse apartment.

113
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:44,613
Mrs. Griffin had recently divorced
her longtime husband -

114
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:49,201
- Gilbert Griffin. The Wall Street
baron remarried only yesterday.

115
00:10:56,918 --> 00:11:00,046
- Morning, Mohammed.
- Morning, Miss Eliot.

116
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:27,783
Elise!

117
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,412
- Oh, God. What a tragedy!
- Poor Cynthia.

118
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,497
And your lips!

119
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,920
Elise arrived with
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg.

120
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:43,799
The queen of New York society.
Nobody gets anywhere -

121
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:46,093
- in this town without
Gunilla's say-so.

122
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:56,396
Hey, Elise!

123
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:07,657
She looks wonderful.
Has she had any work done?

124
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:09,325
Honey, she's a quilt.

125
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:17,042
Then came Cynthia's
former husband Gilbert Griffin.

126
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:20,379
A man made rich by
his first wife's connections and now -

127
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:24,133
- made happy by his
second wife's youthful good looks.

128
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:29,472
The vampire Lestat. And Louis.

129
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:44,153
What a nerve!
He should be hanging his head.

130
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,781
You don't know
what he feels right now.

131
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,548
I knew you would be here.

132
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,134
Alice!

133
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:07,719
- No, Annie.
- Annie!

134
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:12,307
It's so wonderful to see you.
You're wearing our pearls.

135
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:14,184
Yeah.

136
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,438
- Hi. It's Brenda. Brenda Morang.
- Brenda!

137
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,732
Annie. Remember me!

138
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,029
- You look wonderful.
- You do too. You look just...

139
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,532
- ...uncanny.
- Thank you.

140
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,619
Dear, sweet, funny, yearning Brenda.

141
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,708
What?

142
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,799
- She's such a bitch.
- I hate that guy.

143
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:49,429
This might sound horrible after
that but I would really...

144
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:51,723
- I'd love to...
- Lunch?

145
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:54,643
No, you're right. It's not right.

146
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:57,145
Why? We gotta eat. I have a car.

147
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,356
- A limo.
- Yeah.

148
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,653
It is so wonderful seeing you all.

149
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,198
- Elise.
- What?

150
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:11,869
You have not changed a bit in 20 years.

151
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,498
Not one little bit.

152
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,792
It's utterly bizarre.

153
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,460
- Brenda!
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

154
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:21,337
Ladies, would anyone like a drink?

155
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:25,216
- Yes, I would like a Virgin Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

156
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:27,927
- Vodka rocks, please.
- Now, I just want to...

157
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:32,598
...get this out of the way.
I'm the most terrible person.

158
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:37,104
I tried to stay in touch.
I should have written every month.

159
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,232
Annie you had a life to lead.

160
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:44,403
It must have been time-consuming,
churning out those newsletters.

161
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:47,406
It's a terrible excuse for a reunion -

162
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:51,577
- but here we all are.
How are you guys, huh?

163
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,996
Just fine. Couldn't be better.

164
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:57,416
- Things are rolling along for me.
- Same here. Knock wood.

165
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,501
Knock wood.

166
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:02,422
- It's great to see you guys again.
- Cheers.

167
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,844
Why'd she do it? I don't understand.
Could I have helped her?

168
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:11,181
What would make her want to?

169
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:16,728
She gave Gil the best years
of her life. Sacrificed her youth...

170
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:22,025
Always put herself last to bolster
his ego, his drive, his ambition.

171
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:29,116
Just as her dignity hung by a thread,
he ran off with a pre-schooler.

172
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:34,121
- I'm guessing.
- Elise...

173
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,206
You too?

174
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,917
You...Brenda?

175
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:41,629
- Brenda?
- Morty was a big shot on TV.

176
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:46,133
He sold electronics. On our 20th
wedding anniversary, it hits...

177
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:51,639
...mid-life crisis...Major! He starts
working out, grows a mustache.

178
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:55,518
He gets an earring. I said:
"Morty, what are you...a pirate?"

179
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:57,061
"What's next? A parrot?"

180
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,692
Suddenly, I'm a drag. I'm holding
him back because I won't rollerblade.

181
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,945
- What's her name?
- Shelly.

182
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:10,616
Shelly the barracuda. She's 12.

183
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,622
Bren... Elise.

184
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:19,167
I am so sorry about
both of your marriages.

185
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:23,339
I wish I could have helped or
been there in some way.

186
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:28,135
- What about your marriage?
- Everything's just fine.

187
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:31,055
Aaron is so terrific...

188
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,434
Now, let's think...we've been
married for 25 years...

189
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,025
Chris is perfect. I mean,
lesbians are great...nowadays!

190
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:46,403
The marriage is going...
It's going to be really fine.

191
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:49,616
Aaron and I...we're...

192
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:54,621
..temporarily sort of...
We're separated!

193
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,126
- Separated.
- Separated?

194
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,711
Separated.

195
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,937
OK, Elise, the time has come...

196
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:22,066
Spill! Those lips...what's in 'em?

197
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,403
- Are they wax?
- Excuse me?

198
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,114
What else did you have done?
You can tell me.

199
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:33,119
The cheeks, the jawline...
Have just a little or the full enchilada?

200
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:36,956
I work out daily, watch my diet.

201
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:40,293
- I haven't had plastic surgery!
- Good for you!

202
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:42,295
- You look terrific.
- Come on!

203
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,632
You're lying through your caps!

204
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:49,177
OK, I have been refreshed a little.

205
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:52,514
- Oh, God, does it hurt?
- No.

206
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:55,642
The stuff they take off...
Can you keep it?

207
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:58,145
Come on, it's the 90s.

208
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:04,276
Plastic surgery is like good grooming.
It's like brushing your teeth.

209
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:11,366
Elise, you've been yanked, stitched,
stuffed and pulled. You're a turkey.

210
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,620
- And to please your ex-husband?
- No...

211
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:19,417
...to please everybody.
To please everybody!

212
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:25,131
Men, women, studio executives.
Come on, youth and beauty.

213
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:27,216
Men, that's the ticket!

214
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:31,596
When men... No, when women
get to be a certain age...

215
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,184
- ...bye, bye love. Hello, poptarts.
- That's right, baby.

216
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,686
It's a holocaust.

217
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:44,318
God, I wish I had the courage
to give it all up. To say...

218
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:50,992
...who gives a rat's ass.
Just let myself go like you two did.

219
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,494
No offense.

220
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:57,248
- None taken.
- Speak for yourself, OK!

221
00:18:57,457 --> 00:19:01,336
Elise, you're gifted,
talented and successful.

222
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:04,547
Brenda, you're wonderfully verbal.

223
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:08,426
And I am seeing
a very talented therapist.

224
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:14,974
We're in our prime! By the way,
my marriage is fine, thank you.

225
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:20,730
Annie, you have an amazing attitude.

226
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:25,401
You are...so cheerful.

227
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:28,864
- You are...
- Look at me.

228
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:31,158
You are genuinely happy.

229
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,787
- It's a beautiful thing.
- Thank you.

230
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,583
Lithium?

231
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:49,177
You'd have been proud of me, Leslie.
I was the only positive one there.

232
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:55,433
There were traces of the wonderful,
witty women I knew before -

233
00:19:55,642 --> 00:20:03,149
- but they're just so angry.They're so
confused. When we were young...

234
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,860
- ...we had such spirit.
- Say it, honey.

235
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:11,616
- Work from love.
- OK, work from love.

236
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:15,453
- Grow from love.
- Grow from love.

237
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:17,122
Screw the world.

238
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:22,461
- I can't say that. I'm sorry.
- Annie, you are still doing it.

239
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,964
- I know.
- You have a problem with anger.

240
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,507
You're absolutely right.

241
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,969
It's my... I don't know what it is!
It's my mother. It's Connecticut.

242
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,555
- It's all these loud noises.
- And Aaron.

243
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,934
I know we're separated.
But I think this is really a rest period.

244
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,602
We're just getting our...

245
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,816
- Do it, Annie! Get angry.
- I couldn't. I know that I should...

246
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,276
- It's just...
- Hit me.

247
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,153
Stand up and hit me.

248
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:52,784
I can't. I'm so sorry. Maybe...

249
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,580
Let it out. I want you to hit me.
Trust me. It's OK.

250
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,292
OK.

251
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,714
Rambo!

252
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:09,802
A real tough guy.
Come on, Annie...

253
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:13,556
- Hit me!
- I love that.

254
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:19,604
- My God.
- That was better.

255
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:24,274
- I'm sorry. Please don't tell Aaron.
- Time's up.

256
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,152
- Time to go. Do you feel better?
- Thank you.

257
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:34,911
He hasn't the guts to tell me he wants
a divorce. I have to hear it on TV.

258
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,622
- Elise, be cool. Be calm.
- I am!

259
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:40,875
- I saw that show. It was interesting.
- I don't want to hear it.

260
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:45,546
My client's and Miss Eliot's marriage
resulted in many successful films -

261
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:49,092
- including "Inner Urges",
"Human lnstinct" -

262
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:55,348
- and "Animal Nature" in which she
played a sensuous veterinarian.

263
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:57,142
- Thank you.
- My idea!

264
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,311
- Was not.
- Was too.

265
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,856
My client produced these films
which enhanced Miss Eliot's career.

266
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,402
- Therefore, she is indebted to him.
- I produced these films!

267
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:08,696
You knew nothing when I met you.

268
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,949
I taught you everything! What?

269
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:14,243
Those were your best years, Elise.

270
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:20,499
Therefore, we request half of Miss
Eliot's assets and a monthly stipend.

271
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,168
He wants alimony?

272
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:26,547
As for the sculpture, art, Japanese
porcelain and objets d'art-

273
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:30,177
- collected during the marriage,
my client thinks it fair for Miss Eliot -

274
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:34,056
- to dispose of the items
and divide the proceeds evenly.

275
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,933
They were anniversary presents -

276
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:38,309
- Xmas presents. I gave him
everything. Now he wants more?!

277
00:22:42,815 --> 00:22:49,154
Now, Duarto, I ask you: who's this
for? An anorexic teen? A fetus?

278
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:53,242
It's a conspiracy. I know it is. I've
had enough. I'm leading a protest.

279
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:58,247
I'm not buying any more clothes until
designers come to their senses.

280
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:01,667
Brenda worked for a
man named Duarto Feliz -

281
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:05,755
- one of the ten worst
interior decorators in New York.

282
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:09,300
I think his real name
was Duane Hemelwitz.

283
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:12,720
- It's electric. Look at this hideous...
- I can't afford it.

284
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:17,434
You've got to have it. Try it on.
You could sell a broach, your son...

285
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:19,519
Duarto...

286
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:25,233
- Morty! Look at you.
- Brenda, don't embarrass me.

287
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:28,361
Don't embarrass me.
Don't make a scene.

288
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:32,032
You've got nerve.
Know what's embarrassing?

289
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:36,078
Being hassled by Mr. Zaworsky
because I'm behind in the rent.

290
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:40,666
That's embarrassing. Worrying about
how to pay for my kid's college.

291
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,628
You know what? You never listened.
20 years and you never listened.

292
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:48,299
Here! Try this on in the fitting
room. It looks very nice.

293
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:51,302
I could use this. It's very
beautiful. I love the color...

294
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:54,013
But what can I use for money?
How am I gonna pay for it?

295
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:59,352
The company is expanding. Not me!
I'm a mere laborer.

296
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:03,398
- You're a liar and a fraud.
- I have no money. I'm not rich.

297
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:05,400
- Why don't you look in your purse?
- Very funny.

298
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,945
- They're stunning, Morton. I want 'em.
- Morton?

299
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:13,617
- Oh, God, make it go away.
- Shelly, look at you.

300
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:17,996
- The bulimia has paid off.
- Don't start.

301
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:21,541
What's the matter, Morty?
Can't you buy her a whole dress?

302
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,296
Why don't you try these on
in your size?

303
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,221
- It was a delight running into you.
- You've read the script.

304
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:39,894
Yes, it is so original. It's so good.

305
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,147
You're so gifted, Brett.

306
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,778
And Monique... "Monique"...

307
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,659
She is a great character.

308
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,537
Thank you. Man, what a kick!

309
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,291
Elise Eliot in a Brett Artounian film.

310
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,129
So, tell me how do you see her?

311
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,508
Well, uh, I think we go for...

312
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,636
- ...grotesque.
- What?

313
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,558
All the way. No make-up, overhead
lighting. Bring out every wrinkle...

314
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,561
Every crag.
With you in the part -

315
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:24,523
- Monique's mother won't be another
Jurassic fleshbag in a wheelchair.

316
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,818
She's epic.

317
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:32,240
Elise Eliot,
the crypt-keeper. Wow!

318
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:02,187
Mom, I'm spending the night
at Dad's. Don't worry, I'm studying.

319
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:05,191
Baruch atta adonoy...
Happy now?

320
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:18,454
Maurice?

321
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,585
I want another one.
They want me to play the mother.

322
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,465
- Sorry.
- The mother!

323
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,342
Let me ask you something.

324
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,805
- Is this the face of a mother?
- No, ma'am.

325
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:37,433
Certainly not mine.

326
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:44,189
So I thought.

327
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:48,152
Not to be critical,
but you've no feeling for noodles.

328
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:50,237
Thank you, Mom.

329
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,494
Hello.

330
00:26:56,703 --> 00:27:02,542
Aaron... Nothing...
Just having pasta with mother.

331
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,627
No, you say... Sure!

332
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:07,547
That would be good. Bye.

333
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:13,177
We're going to have dinner!
Can you believe that? Oh my God!

334
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:17,140
Do you know what this means?
It means he's re-prioritized.

335
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,643
He's worked through his
relationship phobias -

336
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:24,148
- his fear of intimacy, his thing about
my poisoning his food.

337
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,107
He's ready to recommit.

338
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:31,029
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

339
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:34,241
Excuse me, so sorry.

340
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:46,545
Una?
By yourself?

341
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,048
Si.

342
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:25,545
- How are you?
- Hello. Allow me.

343
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:58,829
I'm not Monique's mother. Angela
Lansbury's Monique's mother.

344
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,583
- Shelley Winters is Unique's mother.
- Now, that's good.

345
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:08,506
- Sean Connery's Unique's mother.
- Perhaps some coffee now.

346
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,762
I take that back. Sean Connery
is Monique's boyfriend.

347
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:19,350
He's 300 years old,
but he's still a stud.

348
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:29,778
- I'm not happy, Maurice.
- I'm going to get you that coffee.

349
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:44,376
- Honey... I think I should go.
- I know.

350
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:51,675
Tomorrow, we could start moving
your things back in...if that's okay?

351
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:56,263
I hated seeing your side
of the closet all empty.

352
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:03,896
Dr. Rosen...she would be proud of us.
I wish she were here.

353
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:10,361
Not literally. I can't wait to tell her
how we worked it all out.

354
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,323
We should get therapy gold stars.

355
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,784
Annie...

356
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:19,788
I love you.

357
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:28,129
Come here.

358
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:32,968
Yes.

359
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,602
I love you.

360
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:46,690
I want a divorce.

361
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:53,990
- Stay calm.
- But we just made love!

362
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:56,910
You asked me out.

363
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:59,829
I asked you out to tell you,
but you looked so great.

364
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:02,665
I thought: "How romantic.
One last time."

365
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:07,128
- A goodbye kiss.
- But this wasn't just a kiss.

366
00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:10,381
Don't be childish.
You know how you manipulate me.

367
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:13,177
- What?! Manipulate?
- Don't.

368
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:16,012
What?.. Oh my God.

369
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:20,266
- Is there someone else?
- No. This is about us.

370
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:21,935
It's really not you.

371
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:24,145
Babe?

372
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:26,648
Oh my God!

373
00:31:26,857 --> 00:31:29,568
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God.

374
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:32,488
- This is very awkward.
- No, Annie was just leaving.

375
00:31:32,697 --> 00:31:35,074
- You told her?
- I was totally upfront.

376
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:37,368
What? Excuse me!

377
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:39,871
Annie, this is rough.
I know that.

378
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,332
Rough?! Wait a minute.
I don't understand. You're my therapist?

379
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:47,169
- I'm a woman.
- He is my husband.

380
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:52,092
We've been separated for months.
Let's not overdramatize, OK?

381
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,636
She's allowed to be angry.
- Annie, let's use this.

382
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:58,557
He's found someone new.
You're free! Closure!

383
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:03,019
I'm sorry,
but that isn't what this is.

384
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:06,356
You're not helping us out here.

385
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:09,192
- Now, I'm sorry.
- So am I!

386
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:16,074
Very sorry I ever met you!
Sorry I loved you for all those years!

387
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:19,704
I'm sorry I was there
for you every minute -

388
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:23,874
- of every day and supported
you in your every move.

389
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:27,419
I'm sorry!

390
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,559
Oh, my God.

391
00:33:38,535 --> 00:33:42,705
"I wish I had talent like Elise"-

392
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,208
- "Brenda's humor" -

393
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:50,005
- "or your strength, Annie."

394
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:55,010
"Most of all I wish
I still had our friendship."

395
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:59,932
"Perhaps Gil isn't the problem."
Oh, God...

396
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:03,144
"Perhaps loneliness is."

397
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:10,150
"Please take care of each other.
Love, Cynthia."

398
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:20,036
- And on such pretty stationery.
- I have to make some calls, Mom.

399
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:30,255
- God, poor Cynthia.
- If only she had called me.

400
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:31,715
If only I were listed.

401
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:35,260
You know what? She was right.
In college we were focused.

402
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,554
We were brave.
We couldn't wait.

403
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:41,308
It's all over. I'm alone.
I don't have anything.

404
00:34:41,642 --> 00:34:43,185
I don't have anything!

405
00:34:43,394 --> 00:34:49,233
You have a son who adores you.
I'm alone! I'm Monique's mother.

406
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:53,112
But Jason's off to college pretty
soon. I'll be even more alone.

407
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:55,281
Plus I'll be a lot older.

408
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,409
Any more plastic surgery,
I won't be able to sleep.

409
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,077
I'll have to work at McDonalds!

410
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:04,040
-I'll have to do ads for adult diapers.
- I'll have to wear them.

411
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:06,125
I just spent 25 years -

412
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:11,882
- with a self-absorbed man
who is marrying my therapist...

413
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,843
- ...who lectured me on self-esteem.
- You win!

414
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:19,181
I won't be that woman anymore.
It's unacceptable.

415
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,227
It is unacceptable! I made
all those stupid movies with Bill.

416
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:25,938
I gave him a career
and he stole mine.

417
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:29,692
I worked behind the cash register
at his first store...in his first 15 stores!

418
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:32,737
I gave Aaron a home
and a daughter.

419
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:36,281
- I washed and ironed his shorts.
- You did?

420
00:35:36,491 --> 00:35:38,659
Well, I supervised.

421
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:42,121
What do we want? Revenge?

422
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,875
No! We are not talking about revenge.
I am talking about justice.

423
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:48,586
I'm going to give Aaron so much
justice he won't see straight...

424
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:51,589
- ...if he thinks partners are trouble.
- Bill's always had it easy.

425
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:55,134
That's right. Bill's had it easy
every inch of the way.

426
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:57,137
He's always had a woman
look after him.

427
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,514
What would happen one day
if he didn't?

428
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,350
What do you think, Brenda?

429
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,562
I love Morty. Very deeply.

430
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:09,524
- I wouldn't want to see him harmed.
- You don't?

431
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:13,404
I want him dumped!
By Little Miss Midriff.

432
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:15,990
By that Stairmastered
L'Orealed crotch jockey.

433
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,575
In front of
the whole Western Hemisphere.

434
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:24,539
On the 6 o'clock news. Okay!
After that I want world peace.

435
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,294
Let's get serious. We helped them rise.
We can help them fall.

436
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,797
How are we going to do that.

437
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:34,342
We're has-beens, hanging on
by a thread. We're discards.

438
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:39,347
We're not hanging on by a thread.
Look, by being together - us - unity.

439
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:42,267
If all the first wives of the world
got together...

440
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:45,312
- ...what else do we need?
- Just one amazing attorney.

441
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:48,732
All we need is us.
Three women who aren't afraid to fight.

442
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:55,197
Stand up for dignity and self-esteem!
Then we'll let 'em have it.

443
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:58,450
- See this?
- What?

444
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:00,535
- Wait, right here, OK?
- OK.

445
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:03,456
See this? Put it in there.

446
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:10,337
All right. First Wives Club,
come to order.

447
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:12,297
Starting the club was easy.

448
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:15,635
Figuring out what to do next
was much harder.

449
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:19,305
We each decided to gather
information about our husbands.

450
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:22,850
- Elise, Elise...
- Yeah...

451
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:23,976
I went in search of a spy.

452
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:29,524
Why can't we call Chris
and ask her to help us?

453
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:33,570
I want her to know I support
her lifestyle completely.

454
00:37:33,904 --> 00:37:37,532
- I've never been to a gay bar!
- Here we go.

455
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:40,660
Hi, I think you're just terrific.

456
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:53,090
Look at this. My God!
Isn't this great? All these women.

457
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:54,758
Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky.

458
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:58,929
Elise Eliot, right?
You're from the movies.

459
00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:01,223
- Yeah...
- I knew you were gay!

460
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:05,894
I said Elise Eliot is so hot!
You're like the most -

461
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:08,314
- amazing babe on this planet.

462
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:11,651
God bless you!

463
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,697
- You wanna dance?
- Uh, yeah.

464
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:19,242
Hi, Sweetie.

465
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:23,204
Mom! Hi...

466
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,624
We wanted to have a little...

467
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,292
What's the matter?

468
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:30,629
I thought we could have a little chat
about our plans.

469
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:32,172
Mom...

470
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:35,509
- You know you're in a gay bar.
- That's what's so great.

471
00:38:35,718 --> 00:38:39,805
It's very women-identified and...
by the way...

472
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:42,725
I'm Chris' Mom.

473
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,894
Are you gay?

474
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:46,687
Sorry!

475
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:54,695
What's wrong?

476
00:38:55,447 --> 00:39:01,161
My lover left mer after 18 years
for some teenager who weighs 12 lb.

477
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:02,828
What am I going to do?

478
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:07,125
- God! That's just like me and Morty.
- Who?

479
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:09,502
Morty.

480
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:12,630
She's butch.

481
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:16,385
Nail Daddy and those
other low-lifes?

482
00:39:16,594 --> 00:39:20,764
I don't mean "nail 'em".
I mean, just teach and help them.

483
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:23,684
- Vaporize them!
- Yeah, sure.

484
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:26,187
Yes! Yes! Yes!

485
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:29,106
I'm in. I'm really in.

486
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:40,910
Elise...

487
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,122
Elise, Chris is in!

488
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:47,250
Can you believe it? Mission
accomplished. We'd better go.

489
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:48,835
She's staying!

490
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:52,172
She's with me, babe!
Come on, honey, my place.

491
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,594
Brenda, you're so possessive!

492
00:39:59,054 --> 00:40:02,390
Something I was just
thinking about...my resume.

493
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,856
Wouldn't interfere with school.
Something part-time until I graduate.

494
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:12,068
Come on, Dad.
How about a little nepotism?

495
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,652
I'll hire you.

496
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:19,783
I'm surprised. You've never
shown interest in advertising.

497
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,037
I know, Daddy.
I'm here to learn.

498
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:26,248
That's great.

499
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:35,758
Elise decided to pull the rug
out from under Bill...literally.

500
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:39,595
After all, his lawyer told her
to dispose of their common property.

501
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,890
Miss Eliot, you know
he hates interruptions.

502
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:45,352
Please let me
tell him you're here. Please...

503
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:50,566
Elise...what a kick!
But I'm on with the Coast.

504
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:54,110
All the good stuff goes.
The Lampico, the Ming vase.

505
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,742
Amari horsemen, Fabergé eggs, the
Wingback chair, the green Tiffany lamp.

506
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:02,036
Babe...what's going on?

507
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:06,624
As requested, I'm consolidating
the matrimonial assets for liquidation.

508
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:10,253
That includes these antiques
I bought for you.

509
00:41:10,587 --> 00:41:13,506
- You are the best.
- Love tokens, anniversary gifts.

510
00:41:13,715 --> 00:41:18,177
- Junk. Here, take that desk too.
- Elise, this hurts me.

511
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:21,222
I care about you...about us.
About the magic.

512
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:24,434
- What exactly is going on here?
- And this Japanese secretary.

513
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:26,937
- I want that to go.
- Back off, Jacko!

514
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,273
Elise, this isn't right. It's hormonal.
You can't do this.

515
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:33,193
- Watch me!
- But this is my stuff!

516
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:36,738
It's the 90s, Bill. Downsize!

517
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,788
At Jason's Bar Mitzvah
2 weeks later-

518
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:48,208
- First Wives Club
got its first big break.

519
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:53,004
Thanks to Brenda's dear,
dear Sicilian uncle.

520
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:59,261
Uncle Carmine. My father's side.

521
00:42:01,764 --> 00:42:05,309
Morty and I have planned for this day
since Jason was born.

522
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:09,480
- But Morty's going to be here.
- But next to me.

523
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:11,983
We're not a family anymore.

524
00:42:12,192 --> 00:42:15,028
It's OK. I'll be fine.

525
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,490
Excuse me.

526
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:28,250
He brought her...

527
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:31,795
...to my son's Bar Mitzvah!

528
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:33,255
Is she a gift?

529
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:41,179
- Brenda, can I speak freely?
- Sure. Annie's cool.

530
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:45,893
I speak for the entire family and your
late father - my beloved brother -

531
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:53,192
- when I say Morty is garbage.
I'd be honored to take him out.

532
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:59,324
No, don't you dare. Morty the
Garbage is my problem.

533
00:42:59,658 --> 00:43:03,078
I'll work it out myself.
Thanks for the thought anyway.

534
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:04,663
My angel.

535
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:08,416
For Morty to treat you this way after
what your father did for him...

536
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:11,002
Where would he be?

537
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:16,008
The first year of his business,
all his merchandise -

538
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:20,179
- fell off one of our trucks.

539
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:21,972
You're not serious?

540
00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:25,517
We were happy
to help you newlyweds.

541
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:28,729
My Morty a crook?

542
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:33,108
Check his books.
They're fiction. Bestsellers!

543
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:37,071
- Ciao.
- Ciao. Grazie.

544
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:41,784
Really liked your uncle.

545
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:50,126
- Mother! Mother! Where are you?
- Over here, bitch.

546
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:54,297
Mother, I met a man. He's an angel.

547
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,300
He's a God. He's a doctor.

548
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,594
It's perfect.

549
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,602
- Do I really have the part?
- Baby, you know it.

550
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,605
Pizza!

551
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,818
- Oh my God!
- Elise!

552
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,946
- There's the Lichtenstein.
- What the hell are you doing?

553
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,575
- The Dine. Take that.
- This is so cool.

554
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,868
- All the gym equipment.
- I'm getting a restraining order.

555
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:27,122
No, Bill, this is great.
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.

556
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:31,002
I've seen all your movies
and I want to be just like you, only me!

557
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:35,590
Phoebe, some advice...
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

558
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:39,344
- Pheebs, she's bitter.
- And take the cappuccino machine!

559
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:41,513
Bill, I have a great idea.

560
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:44,641
Wouldn't she be great
to play opposite me?

561
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,726
Bill is producing this new,
incredible movie -

562
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,646
- with this young, hot director.
I'm the star of it.

563
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,691
- I'm Monique.
- What?

564
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,068
And you can be my Mom!

565
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:04,578
While Elise cleaned out Bill's office,
loft and house in the Hamptons -

566
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:08,624
Brenda and I looked for an office.
A base for the Club.

567
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,215
Come in.

568
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:22,096
Look at this.
It's early everything, huh.

569
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:26,058
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.

570
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,438
You know what it says?
"I beat Meryl."

571
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:34,275
- It does not. Put that down.
- Is there chocolate inside?

572
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:36,487
- Put it down!
- OK, OK.

573
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:42,409
Put it gently down.
Look. Do you believe this stuff?

574
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,245
I don't know where to put it.
There's no room in my warehouse.

575
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:48,665
I could have put it in my
building downtown.

576
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:50,668
- You own a building?
- Yeah, I do.

577
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:52,837
I sublet it normally, but...

578
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:55,548
...now it's...vacant.

579
00:46:06,935 --> 00:46:10,480
There's a lot of work to be done.
You have to see it.

580
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:12,857
Look at this.

581
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:20,698
All right, this is perfect.

582
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:25,913
All right, girls!
This is fabulous.

583
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:33,921
While Brenda and I worked like crazy
gathering information -

584
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,049
- Elise spent most of her time
on the phone to her agent.

585
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,553
Dan Carlin, please.
Elise Eliot calling.

586
00:46:41,763 --> 00:46:45,600
- Elise Eliot!
- And finally it came through for her.

587
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:51,981
- This is a great play!
- I told her she had to do it.

588
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,526
I don't want to do theater!
I haven't done theater in years!

589
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:59,697
Bill always said theater
was bad for my career...

590
00:46:59,906 --> 00:47:03,034
- ...which actually I agree with.
- Excuse me, but this is a great role.

591
00:47:03,243 --> 00:47:06,996
This is about a bitter, unloved,
emotionally barren woman.

592
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:09,583
- That's not me!
- It's you!

593
00:47:10,334 --> 00:47:11,793
Thank you.

594
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:18,050
- Hello.
- It's Bill. Where's Elise?

595
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:20,970
- It's for you... Bill.
- Hello.

596
00:47:21,178 --> 00:47:24,306
- Listen to me, you piece of garbage.
- I can't hear you.

597
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:27,518
I'll sue you. I'll break you.

598
00:47:27,727 --> 00:47:30,354
You vindictive sack of silicone!

599
00:47:30,563 --> 00:47:35,151
- That's my car, you piece of plastic!
- Oh, darn.

600
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,654
Bill... Lamborghini.

601
00:47:37,862 --> 00:47:39,530
The Lamborghini.

602
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:41,073
He's mad. Whoo!

603
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:46,412
Elise, can I ask you a question?

604
00:47:46,621 --> 00:47:50,374
Aren't you frustrated? You climb
and climb and go nowhere.

605
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:55,589
I love it! Burns off the booze.
You want to know something?

606
00:47:55,798 --> 00:48:00,052
- I get my best ideas when I work out.
- You get ideas?!

607
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:03,389
It clears out my head. I think straight.
Everything makes sense.

608
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:06,725
Better start thinking because
we need Morty's books to prove fraud.

609
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:10,812
I know where they are!
Morty just bought Shelly a penthouse.

610
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:14,442
- Now, figure out how to get in.
- Duarto.

611
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,778
Shelly has a new apartment
that needs to be decorated.

612
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:23,826
Gunilla, I'd adore it.

613
00:48:24,577 --> 00:48:28,205
Enchantée. Au revoir, jolie!

614
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:35,005
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg personally
invited me to her society luncheon.

615
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:36,964
Why?

616
00:48:38,842 --> 00:48:44,389
Gunilla Goldberg was happy helping
us, she being a first wife herself.

617
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:48,643
Indeed, Gunilla was a 1st, 2nd, 3rd -

618
00:48:48,852 --> 00:48:53,440
- and 4th wife, which accounted for
her very comfortable surroundings.

619
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:56,693
This is delicious!
Usually I bring my own dressing.

620
00:48:56,902 --> 00:49:00,947
That fat-free ranch stuff,
but this is restaurant quality.

621
00:49:01,157 --> 00:49:03,993
- Thank you.
- Can I tell you something?

622
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,370
When I first got your call,
I said to Morty...

623
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:11,292
"This just feels so right."
Me and Gunilla.

624
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:15,880
I used to work for Morty
as his executive assistant.

625
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:18,800
He was married to that
nightmare then...Brenda -

626
00:49:19,009 --> 00:49:21,720
- a completely class-free
dumpster woman.

627
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:25,307
I said to him: "Morty, you' ve got to
move on and move up."

628
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:29,853
Now, here I am! Taste Central.

629
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:36,777
The moment I saw you...my first
impression was she's someone...

630
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:40,990
See, that's what I told him.
But he doesn't get it.

631
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:44,618
- He doesn't get a lot of things.
- Are you finished?

632
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:47,830
- Yeah, I'm done.
- Take the fork.

633
00:49:50,249 --> 00:49:52,000
Fork!

634
00:49:54,003 --> 00:50:01,302
All you need to enter society
is some advice and a guiding hand.

635
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:03,262
Like what?

636
00:50:03,597 --> 00:50:07,642
The correct florist
and the utterly ideal chef.

637
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:11,312
Of course, a decorator...of death.

638
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:16,526
Your house is your calling card.
It has to be perfected -

639
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:19,321
- photographed, published.

640
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,157
Can you really help me?
I would kill for that.

641
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:29,039
That's unnecessary.
Just two words: Duarto Feliz.

642
00:50:29,248 --> 00:50:32,793
He is a genius. A gem!

643
00:50:34,253 --> 00:50:38,006
Of course, he's impossible to get.
He works all the time.

644
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:44,972
Oh, my God!

645
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:48,434
There she is! Princess Pelvis.

646
00:50:48,643 --> 00:50:51,020
- Gunilla says she went for it.
- Fabulous!

647
00:50:51,229 --> 00:50:53,105
Johnny, let's go.

648
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:56,234
So, Duarto makes his move
and Shelly falls for it.

649
00:50:56,443 --> 00:50:59,487
- Let's synchronize our watches.
- Just like "Mission Impossible".

650
00:51:01,448 --> 00:51:04,701
- These people are always late.
- Shut up, Morty, and stay shut up.

651
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,330
- Take it easy.
- What if he doesn't like us?

652
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:12,084
- What are you worried about?
Go on, answer the bell.

653
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:19,300
- Okay!
- Fine.

654
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:30,853
Hello!
Please, do come in.

655
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,399
It's an honor and beyond.

656
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:37,861
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg informs me
you are my new best friend.

657
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:41,614
- I hope!
- Duarto Feliz...And may I?

658
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:43,366
Please!

659
00:51:44,826 --> 00:51:46,702
Extraordinary!

660
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:52,125
Interesting little touches everywhere.

661
00:51:53,293 --> 00:51:58,381
- What?
- That chair is agony.

662
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,593
- Morty, do something!
- What?

663
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:05,263
- Just cover it up. Get rid of it!
-Take it easy.

664
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:07,766
It's his chair.
I didn't want that chair.

665
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,477
- It's covered.
- Thanks ever so much.

666
00:52:10,686 --> 00:52:13,313
Now, then...

667
00:52:14,649 --> 00:52:16,317
I feel...

668
00:52:16,526 --> 00:52:17,902
You feel...

669
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:20,196
Light...

670
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:32,166
- Get out.
- What?!

671
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:35,836
I need to be alone
in this space for an hour, at least.

672
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:38,423
It is very delicate.
I must bond.

673
00:52:38,632 --> 00:52:41,760
- We understand.
- I must have total access.

674
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:45,013
- What is upstairs?
- That's just the office.

675
00:52:45,222 --> 00:52:46,556
Le office.

676
00:52:46,891 --> 00:52:49,185
Stay out of
le office!

677
00:52:49,393 --> 00:52:52,396
- Leave me one hour.
- We understand.

678
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,815
One hour!
Thank you.

679
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:02,740
Bye bye.

680
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:08,037
Girls... Girls!
Come on, hurry.

681
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:13,251
- Ow, my knee, damn it.
- We don't have much time.

682
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:18,381
- Where are we going?
- Honey, don't worry about it.

683
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,550
Let's go in here.

684
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:23,053
Here we go!
In here.

685
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,316
Brenda!

686
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:40,070
There's an office upstairs.

687
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,030
There's an office upstairs!

688
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:44,241
- Let's go upstairs.
- Good girl!

689
00:53:47,787 --> 00:53:49,747
I feel dizzy.

690
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:56,629
Annie, check the computer.
I'll check the files.

691
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:59,257
I need the key.
Where's the key?

692
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:06,764
- Hello!
- Ready.

693
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:12,812
Come on, tax returns.

694
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:32,416
What is this stuff?

695
00:54:42,302 --> 00:54:43,553
Got 'em!

696
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:48,141
Come on, hustle, Morty.

697
00:54:48,475 --> 00:54:50,226
Social climbers on the rise.

698
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:52,729
Oh, God!

699
00:54:52,938 --> 00:54:56,066
- They're back! They're back!
- Stall them.

700
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,194
- With what?
- Make something up. lmprovise.

701
00:54:59,403 --> 00:55:00,862
- What's the matter with you?
- I can't improvise.

702
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:03,156
I'm putting
the files right in here.

703
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:07,035
Keep them away from the front door.

704
00:55:07,244 --> 00:55:10,997
- I'm clean. I'm clean. I'm clean.
- Slap her. Slap her.

705
00:55:17,672 --> 00:55:19,006
Hello!

706
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:23,177
I know you said an hour, but it's cold
today and I couldn't stay away.

707
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:24,637
- Tell me everything!
- How much?

708
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:28,808
I'll tell you what. We're going to
look out the living room windows.

709
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:32,478
Why? Because I'll tell you why.

710
00:55:32,687 --> 00:55:37,275
Windows are the eyes of a room.

711
00:55:37,484 --> 00:55:39,778
-So?
- Oh, Duarto.

712
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:44,240
The valance...
The valance is our eyebrows.

713
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,450
- The drapes are...
- I gotta pee.

714
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,745
You can't, you can't!

715
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:54,668
Where was l?
Oh, the drapes...are the eyelashes.

716
00:55:54,877 --> 00:55:58,422
You said windows were eyelashes.

717
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:05,720
What do we do?
Where do we go?

718
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,349
The window. Come on.

719
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:17,107
What do we do now?

720
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:25,325
We'll get into this window
washing thing and ride it down.

721
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:34,000
- Annie...
- You gotta go down, honey.

722
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:38,046
- It's the only way out!
- I have a fear of everything.

723
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:42,843
- Come on, you're the new Annie.
- Annie, watch!

724
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:47,222
I'm going in first.
I do all my own stunts.

725
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:57,232
Gimme the controls!

726
00:56:58,818 --> 00:57:02,780
I can't do this!
I can't stand this!

727
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,949
Gotham's my inspiration.

728
00:57:05,158 --> 00:57:09,662
The white of the snow
pelting the trees of Central Park.

729
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:13,624
The yellow of the taxis.
The blue...

730
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:19,255
But who cares about blue?
No one feels blue with my design.

731
00:57:19,464 --> 00:57:22,675
- Forget about that.
- What about those drapes?

732
00:57:22,884 --> 00:57:25,595
The window meeting is over.
It's time to consider the stairs.

733
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:28,223
- What about that dumb fountain?
- I rather like it.

734
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:30,600
I'd rather look at the window.

735
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,731
Oh, my God!

736
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:42,612
-Is that Elise Eliot?
- Elise, you look great!

737
00:57:42,822 --> 00:57:45,741
You look great! !

738
00:58:13,979 --> 00:58:15,355
You want to go again?

739
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:21,820
- Oh, my God!
- I've never been so petrified.

740
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:26,074
No, really, really...except for
that one time.

741
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:30,370
- I'm not going to tell you.
- Why not? We won't judge you.

742
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,291
We're your buddies. We cherish you.

743
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:36,502
We would never ever make fun of you.
Ever! Would we, hon?

744
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:38,587
- No, no.
- OK.

745
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:44,343
All right. You remember
Cynthia's 21st birthday?

746
00:58:44,552 --> 00:58:48,180
Her parents rented that big hall.

747
00:58:48,515 --> 00:58:51,017
We wanted to do
something special for her.

748
00:58:51,226 --> 00:58:54,145
Elise thought we should be
the entertainment.

749
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:57,357
We were supposed
to sing to her like a girl group.

750
00:58:57,566 --> 00:59:01,319
We sang that Leslie Gore song.
Remember? We were a big hit.

751
00:59:01,528 --> 00:59:04,989
I hated it. I can't sing.
I was terrified before all those people.

752
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,118
I'd ratherjump off that building.

753
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:11,038
- You were wonderful.
- But it was for Cynthia.

754
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:14,375
I remember that.
We were a group.

755
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,377
We are a group!
We should do it and sing again.

756
00:59:17,712 --> 00:59:19,880
- Let's do it again. I wanna sing.
- Why?

757
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,383
Why not? We'll blend.
We'll sing with you.

758
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:26,053
- We'll blend!
- All of us altogether, real loud, OK?

759
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,056
You're gonna sing with me, all right?

760
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:34,061
To Cynthia.
Happy birthday wherever you are.

761
00:59:36,481 --> 00:59:38,232
All right, I'm ready.

762
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:43,446
- Go!
- Pick a note!

763
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,865
You don't own me!

764
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:50,120
I'm not just one of your many toys

765
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:55,751
You don't own me!
Don't say I can't go with other boys

766
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,881
And don't tell me what to do!

767
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:04,510
And don't tell me what to say!

768
01:00:07,346 --> 01:00:09,306
I sound horrible.
I hate you for this.

769
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:17,439
Hi, Mom, it's your little spy
at the ad agency.

770
01:00:17,649 --> 01:00:20,985
I can't talk now,
but have I got news for you!

771
01:00:21,194 --> 01:00:25,907
I think it's time you got back
into the ad business. Call me.

772
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:32,038
Bren? It's Annie. Listen to this.
Aaron's partners want to sell-

773
01:00:32,372 --> 01:00:36,626
- their share of the ad agency.
I could buy it if I had the money.

774
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,296
Can you imagine?
God, Aaron would die.

775
01:00:42,883 --> 01:00:48,096
It's Brenda. Annie needs a
down payment for an ad agency.

776
01:00:48,305 --> 01:00:50,932
Any idea where
she can get the money?

777
01:00:51,642 --> 01:00:56,438
So, Elise sold me Bill's things
at a very reasonable price.

778
01:00:56,647 --> 01:00:58,941
And I put it all up for auction.

779
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:02,486
Your sale has generated
a great deal of excitement.

780
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,406
I want to raise funds
for my organization.

781
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:08,326
However, some lots
may fail to sell.

782
01:01:08,535 --> 01:01:10,411
I wouldn't worry about that.

783
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,247
At $380,000
for the Lichtenstein.

784
01:01:13,456 --> 01:01:16,876
$380,000, selling then.
Fair warning of $380,000.

785
01:01:17,085 --> 01:01:18,961
Paddle 3-7-2.

786
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:23,759
$380,000 for that?

787
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:27,929
Lot 55 is the Louis chaise canape
showing here on my left....

788
01:01:28,138 --> 01:01:31,057
And I have $45,000
on the telephone.

789
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:32,851
- It's gorgeous.
- Fabulous.

790
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,519
Absolutely sublime.

791
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:37,314
It doesn't look very comfy.
Morty likes his recliner.

792
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:40,651
...in place now at $ 48,000.
$50,000 at the desk now.

793
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,779
$50,000...$55,000.
The lady's bid up front now.

794
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:47,658
My God, did you see who bid?
That's Elise Eliot.

795
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:51,078
She has impeccable
taste...for an actress.

796
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:55,249
Fair warning then at $55,000.

797
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:59,211
- It's a fabulous chaise.
- I don't know.

798
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:02,966
That sofa? Architectural Digest.
The cover!

799
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,219
- Really?
- You? Guaranteed!

800
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:10,265
$60,000 this side!
New bidder now at $60,000.

801
01:02:10,474 --> 01:02:12,976
Lot is yours, madam, at $60,000.

802
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:14,561
You, madam, $60,000.

803
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:19,566
- I got a chaise.
- Beautiful!

804
01:02:22,486 --> 01:02:26,865
Lot 57, the fine Yung Che charger
showing here and $90,000 to start.

805
01:02:27,074 --> 01:02:30,077
$90,000 is bid. Thank you, sir.
$90,000...$100,000!

806
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:33,330
New bidder now, $110,000.
The lady's bid here now.

807
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:37,167
$115,000. Thank you, sir.
$115,000.

808
01:02:38,127 --> 01:02:40,212
- It's cute.
- It's sublime.

809
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:44,174
- Essential!
- Oxygen!

810
01:02:44,384 --> 01:02:47,303
$125,000.
The lady's bid now at 125.

811
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:50,723
Need a new face now.
$125,000 up front.

812
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:54,602
- $130,000. New bidder up front.
- Elise Eliot must be very rich.

813
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:58,981
- Show business.
- Teach her a lesson. Come on.

814
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:03,779
At $130,000. 130...
$135,000 at the back!

815
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,948
New bidder now.
$135,000.

816
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:10,118
$135,000.
Lady's bid at the back.

817
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,664
- Who is she? She looks familiar.
- Just someone glamorous.

818
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:18,669
Some Euro-trash. Shelly, you
can't let that plate leave the US.

819
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:22,548
- It's Japanese.
- Don't they have enough?

820
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:29,430
$135,000. The bidder's here
at the back at $135,000.

821
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,767
Lady's bid at the back at $135,000.

822
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,687
It's yours now at $135,000

823
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,064
Bidder's here at the back.

824
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,984
- Go ahead!
- Aber gehen Sie!

825
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,782
Jackie O had one just like it.

826
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,496
$140,000 up front now.
$140,000...

827
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:55,165
...against you at the back, madam.

828
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:57,459
$140,000...$140,000.

829
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:01,546
For you, madam, paddle 560.

830
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:06,134
Thank you, thank you.

831
01:04:07,178 --> 01:04:12,475
Shelly, what happened here?
$140,000 for a plate?

832
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:16,145
$47,000 for a carpet?
A used carpet?

833
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:19,565
$300,000 for a Lamborghini?
Are you crazy?

834
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:23,736
I bought the car for you.
It was only 300 grand. It was a gift.

835
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:25,947
With my money you bought it!
I bought me the gift!

836
01:04:26,156 --> 01:04:28,324
Jesus, I want a lifestyle!

837
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:31,786
With some ambiance and some
classic, eternal good taste.

838
01:04:31,995 --> 01:04:34,998
But not for $300,000, Shelly!

839
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,303
I can leave if you like.

840
01:04:47,636 --> 01:04:51,681
It's not like you've
asked me to marry you.

841
01:04:53,142 --> 01:04:54,726
Would you...

842
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:57,855
...unzip me?

843
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:03,986
Thank you.

844
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,617
Shel, I lost my temper. I'm sorry.
The Lamborghini is a very good deal.

845
01:05:14,956 --> 01:05:18,709
- Hi, Jase. How was the game?
- Knicks lose again.

846
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:22,964
Every player on that team is
a millionaire. They can't really lose.

847
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:25,258
- What do you think?
- That's not new, is it?

848
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:29,012
It's better than new.
It's the first time it's fit me in 3 years.

849
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:32,474
Look at me!
I have a waist, legs... Who knew?

850
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:34,226
How's your father?
Did you have fun?

851
01:05:34,435 --> 01:05:38,397
- Yeah, but don't let that bother you.
- What a thing to say!

852
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:43,611
Jason, look. I remember how great
it was when we were a family.

853
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,656
Even though we're not together now,
you still have both of us.

854
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:50,492
You guys can't even pick out
my birthday card without a lawyer.

855
01:05:50,702 --> 01:05:54,872
Jason, I know you worry
about your father.

856
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:58,834
He's a very good man.

857
01:05:59,044 --> 01:06:04,174
He's a very good,
very confused man.

858
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:08,344
But you don't have to
worry about me -

859
01:06:08,554 --> 01:06:11,974
- because I'm going to be fine.
I'm lightening up, literally.

860
01:06:12,307 --> 01:06:17,187
And you know what?
Your father and I love you to pieces.

861
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:21,483
- There, did I embarrass you?
- Almost.

862
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:25,112
You want to go to a movie?
Me and you?

863
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:28,991
- Together...in public?
- Mom, I'm sorry.

864
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,871
I was a little freaked out
by Dad getting engaged to Shelly.

865
01:06:36,499 --> 01:06:42,421
Oh, well... I can see how
that would rip your heart out.

866
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,550
Thanks, Mom.

867
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:07,447
We gotta nail Bill.

868
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,158
We gotta...slaughter him.

869
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,369
Right off the face of the planet.

870
01:07:12,578 --> 01:07:16,623
Him and that tramp. That infant.

871
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:20,086
- I need a drink.
- Holy moly, she's loaded.

872
01:07:20,294 --> 01:07:23,714
I know. I'm really worried.
She had me look at Bill's records -

873
01:07:23,923 --> 01:07:25,799
- and the guy's a saint.
He's clean.

874
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:30,388
- He's a saint with a great lawyer.
- What?

875
01:07:30,597 --> 01:07:34,350
Are you saying
you can't find anything on him?

876
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,229
- I'm really sorry. I'll look again.
- This isn't fair.

877
01:07:38,438 --> 01:07:42,692
Aaron's going to be massacred.
Morty's won't know what hit him -

878
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:46,154
- and Bill's just gonna walk away.
With alimony!

879
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,906
We'll keep trying, Elise.

880
01:07:48,115 --> 01:07:52,828
You'd better keep trying because
this is my life and my money!

881
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:56,248
What do you know?
You don't get it. You're civilians.

882
01:07:56,457 --> 01:07:58,459
You're just housewives.

883
01:07:58,668 --> 01:08:00,753
- That's it!
- No, wait.

884
01:08:00,962 --> 01:08:02,630
You'll never understand.

885
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:05,715
Gimme that.
Excuse me. Give that back.

886
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:08,928
I say this with love compassion
and true sisterhood.

887
01:08:09,304 --> 01:08:11,598
You are full of shit!

888
01:08:12,849 --> 01:08:14,183
What?

889
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:15,851
OK, alimony sucks.

890
01:08:16,061 --> 01:08:18,938
OK, you didn't get to play
a policewoman in a Wonderbra.

891
01:08:19,272 --> 01:08:20,606
But you grew up gorgeous.

892
01:08:20,857 --> 01:08:24,193
Thanks to Cher's pioneering efforts,
you still haven't hit puberty.

893
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:26,363
Once you were a terrific actress.

894
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:28,323
You even got an Oscar to prove it.

895
01:08:28,657 --> 01:08:31,243
You spent your whole life
with people sucking up to you.

896
01:08:31,618 --> 01:08:36,664
I'm sure Annie agrees with me that
your perception of life is a bit altered.

897
01:08:36,874 --> 01:08:41,462
- Annie, do you agree with her?
- Come on!

898
01:08:42,087 --> 01:08:43,546
Brenda, she's very upset.

899
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:46,467
- Two pinheads!
- Wait a minute.

900
01:08:46,676 --> 01:08:48,552
You've got some nerve.

901
01:08:48,761 --> 01:08:52,014
I drink because I'm a sensitive
and highly strung person.

902
01:08:52,223 --> 01:08:54,308
No! That's why your co-stars drink!

903
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:56,268
I am not a drunk!

904
01:08:56,477 --> 01:08:59,813
Really?
Let's examine the evidence.

905
01:09:00,023 --> 01:09:02,525
Look, all bottles!

906
01:09:02,734 --> 01:09:05,028
And gallon jugs.

907
01:09:05,362 --> 01:09:08,073
- I had guests.
- Who? Guns 'N' Roses?

908
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:09,824
Come on, you two.

909
01:09:10,033 --> 01:09:14,120
The enemy's out there, not in here,
and we are best friends!

910
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:16,831
After all those years,
you never called me.

911
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,959
- You were unlisted!
- You always gossip behind my back.

912
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:21,503
- You deserve it!
- You didn't invite me...

913
01:09:21,712 --> 01:09:24,756
- ...to your son's Bar Mitzvah.
- You wouldn't have come.

914
01:09:24,965 --> 01:09:27,759
- Yeah, it was in Hebrew.
- Oh, shut up!

915
01:09:28,093 --> 01:09:30,679
You think a movie star
doesn't have feelings.

916
01:09:30,888 --> 01:09:33,515
You're wrong!
I do have feelings.

917
01:09:33,724 --> 01:09:36,310
I'm an actress!
I have all of them.

918
01:09:36,519 --> 01:09:41,857
I wouldn't understand. I'm just a
housewife and a child to raise.

919
01:09:42,066 --> 01:09:46,320
You were always jealous of me 'cause
I was blonde, beautiful and talented.

920
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:49,782
- And I could have any guy I wanted.
- And did! Every guy!

921
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:52,368
Most of the senior class
and half the faculty.

922
01:09:52,577 --> 01:09:53,953
It was the 1960s.

923
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:56,956
Look at this place.
Is this where your fan club meets?

924
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,041
Do you have ritual sacrifices?

925
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:00,502
Put that down!

926
01:10:01,545 --> 01:10:03,630
- I won that!
- I remember.

927
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:06,132
- Your first "talkie".
- What did you ever win?

928
01:10:06,341 --> 01:10:10,011
A pie-eating contest?
Best Ingestion.

929
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:14,266
Oh, no...

930
01:10:14,475 --> 01:10:16,143
Brenda!

931
01:10:16,477 --> 01:10:18,437
This is a Golden Globe.

932
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:20,022
It's sacred!

933
01:10:20,231 --> 01:10:22,525
It's...trademarked!

934
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:28,447
- Are you crazy?
- Stop it. Both of you!

935
01:10:28,656 --> 01:10:33,035
Annie. You choose!
Who's your friend? Me or Brenda?

936
01:10:33,244 --> 01:10:35,746
For once, make a decision.
Who's your buddy?

937
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:37,539
Some Beverly Hills science project...

938
01:10:37,749 --> 01:10:39,917
...or a woman with her own aisle
at the supermarket.

939
01:10:40,126 --> 01:10:42,628
I'm sorry,
but I'm not getting involved with this.

940
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:45,047
You both have severe
psychological problems.

941
01:10:45,257 --> 01:10:50,137
I'm... I'm the nice one here.
I'm not like this.

942
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:51,721
- What?
- Yes.

943
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:53,806
- The nice one?
- Well, I mean I...

944
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,393
- You mean the rag mop, don't ya?
- Excuse me!

945
01:10:56,602 --> 01:10:59,438
The one who can't manage
a simple declarative sentence!

946
01:10:59,646 --> 01:11:01,814
The wimp! The wuss!

947
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:05,569
Well...I changed.
I'm much stronger than I used to be.

948
01:11:05,778 --> 01:11:08,280
You are self-righteous!
You pipsqueek.

949
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:10,282
Shut up, you arthritic sex kitten.

950
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:12,868
- Shut up, Morty's girl.
- Monique's mom!

951
01:11:13,077 --> 01:11:16,330
Stop it!
You're both selfish assholes.

952
01:11:21,753 --> 01:11:25,381
- Oh, my face! Oh, my God.
- That is enough.

953
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,092
Have we forgotten
what we're doing here?

954
01:11:28,426 --> 01:11:29,468
What has happened to us?

955
01:11:29,678 --> 01:11:35,725
We're supposed to help each other,
not rip each other to shreds.

956
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:38,728
She's right.

957
01:11:40,188 --> 01:11:45,318
You know, I gotta say
I always wondered -

958
01:11:45,527 --> 01:11:48,530
- how drunk Cynthia was
when she decided -

959
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:51,783
- to do a jackknife onto Park Ave.

960
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:28,759
- Mom.
- What's wrong? I came right over.

961
01:13:28,968 --> 01:13:32,930
Things are not working out
the way I planned.

962
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:35,307
And you called me?

963
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:38,435
Oh, my God!

964
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:57,539
I don't know.
It's just completely falling apart.

965
01:13:57,747 --> 01:14:00,458
We're at each other's throats.

966
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:04,295
It's like it's all my fault.
I'm just useless.

967
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:07,841
- You are not!
- Honey, I am.

968
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:11,803
The past few weeks you've been
a totally different person.

969
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:15,265
You've stopped apologizing
for yourself all the time.

970
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:17,017
I know. I'm sorry, honey.

971
01:14:17,226 --> 01:14:21,396
This First Wives Club thing
can't work and it never could.

972
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,607
You make it work. It can.
You can make it work.

973
01:14:23,816 --> 01:14:25,692
Call Brenda and Elise.

974
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:28,696
I can't call them.
What will I say to them?

975
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:31,198
This is just...
I should have seen this.

976
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:32,866
I should've seen this coming.

977
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:37,038
I know.
Why not write each of them a note!

978
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,208
Or maybe send a hanging plant.

979
01:14:44,045 --> 01:14:46,130
Just a suggestion.

980
01:14:47,257 --> 01:14:49,133
No, Mom.

981
01:14:49,343 --> 01:14:52,262
No, it's over. It's over.

982
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,240
Brenda?

983
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:14,493
I don't want to be like Cynthia.

984
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,250
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

985
01:15:24,295 --> 01:15:26,171
Come on in.

986
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:30,969
- I've never been to your apartment.
- I know.

987
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:36,808
- Annie!
- Annie!

988
01:15:39,937 --> 01:15:42,314
Annie, what are you doing?

989
01:15:42,523 --> 01:15:43,899
Elise, it's your loft.

990
01:15:44,108 --> 01:15:46,819
I'm storing some things
or I'll burn them if you want.

991
01:15:47,027 --> 01:15:49,404
- But why?
- Why? Are you kidding?

992
01:15:49,613 --> 01:15:52,449
We've completely
embarrassed ourselves.

993
01:15:52,658 --> 01:15:54,826
We've become exactly what
the world thinks we are.

994
01:15:55,036 --> 01:15:58,581
And our ex-husbands!
We are "The Three Witches".

995
01:15:58,789 --> 01:16:02,250
Witches?
Well, I'll tell you something!

996
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,794
- Witches have powers.
- What?

997
01:16:04,003 --> 01:16:06,505
They do!
They've powers for good and evil.

998
01:16:06,714 --> 01:16:08,090
Brenda and I are OK now.

999
01:16:08,299 --> 01:16:11,844
We've figured out what
we think we know what we want.

1000
01:16:12,053 --> 01:16:14,847
I know what went wrong.
The whole crackpot idea went wrong.

1001
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:18,392
Revenge and egos...
Thinking we could fix our silly lives.

1002
01:16:18,602 --> 01:16:21,438
- Exactly! We were thinking too small.
- What are you talking about?

1003
01:16:21,646 --> 01:16:24,565
We were trying to get back
at our ex's, which is a start -

1004
01:16:24,775 --> 01:16:27,361
- but it isn't enough.
It's so petty and limited!

1005
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:28,945
No wonder
we're snarling at each other.

1006
01:16:29,154 --> 01:16:31,448
No wonder we're
at each other's throats. Listen!

1007
01:16:31,657 --> 01:16:33,742
We have to take our plan
and expand it.

1008
01:16:33,951 --> 01:16:35,827
First thing, we take care of
our own guys -

1009
01:16:36,036 --> 01:16:39,372
- because they really
have it coming. Then...we go global!

1010
01:16:39,582 --> 01:16:40,916
How?

1011
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:42,709
Are you interested
because I'll tell you.

1012
01:16:42,918 --> 01:16:44,252
I don't know if I'm interested.

1013
01:16:44,462 --> 01:16:45,838
What if we erupt again?

1014
01:16:46,047 --> 01:16:49,050
Or Elise, what if you start drinking,
and, Brenda, you start sniping?

1015
01:16:49,258 --> 01:16:50,509
- Been there!
- Done that!

1016
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:52,511
- It's not enough for me.
- Annie...

1017
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,431
Take a good look at Elise.
Look at her!

1018
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:59,268
I'm sober.
And I'm going to do the play.

1019
01:16:59,602 --> 01:17:02,730
- Really?
- I'll be there front row opening night.

1020
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:04,899
Our friendship is everything.
Don't leave.

1021
01:17:05,233 --> 01:17:06,901
We can't fall apart now.

1022
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:09,821
But even if we want to,
we don't have enough information.

1023
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:13,033
Of course, we do have stuff
on Aaron and Morty.

1024
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:16,077
But what about Bill?
We're still on square one.

1025
01:17:16,286 --> 01:17:21,499
No, not exactly.
I admit all he's done so far is legal...

1026
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:23,794
...as far as he knows.

1027
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:27,631
- What do you mean?
- It's all a question of angles.

1028
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,050
- Are you in?
- Are you back?

1029
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:35,764
- Talk.
- Well... After you.

1030
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:45,900
I'm seriously thinking of taking
the role of Monique's Mom.

1031
01:17:47,861 --> 01:17:50,697
And I've been thinking
about who she is -

1032
01:17:50,905 --> 01:17:54,867
- what she's about. I'm sure you're
doing the same thing with Monique.

1033
01:17:55,076 --> 01:17:58,829
Sure. I've been thinking like,
streaks...

1034
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:00,707
...just around my face.

1035
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:02,459
Oh!

1036
01:18:03,502 --> 01:18:06,630
And what a beautiful face.

1037
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:11,426
Anyway, the reason I called is
if we're going to work together -

1038
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,763
- I think we should get to
know one another.

1039
01:18:14,972 --> 01:18:16,348
It's important.

1040
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,268
Bill is so wrong.

1041
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:22,897
- You are not Satan.
- Oh, stop!

1042
01:18:24,774 --> 01:18:29,987
Do you need a TV or a VCR
or a personal computer?

1043
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:32,698
Who's the first name in top quality -

1044
01:18:32,907 --> 01:18:34,491
- low-cost appliances?

1045
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:37,078
Let's ask this beautiful
young lady here.

1046
01:18:37,287 --> 01:18:39,372
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Why, hello!

1047
01:18:39,706 --> 01:18:41,165
- Hello.
- Hi.

1048
01:18:41,374 --> 01:18:46,045
I'm in the market for a
low-quality, top-cost appliance.

1049
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,838
- Cut!
- Shelly.

1050
01:18:48,048 --> 01:18:50,634
Top-quality, low-cost.

1051
01:18:52,302 --> 01:18:54,304
- Morton Cushman.
- Yeah, why?

1052
01:18:54,513 --> 01:18:55,847
You have the right to remain silent.

1053
01:18:56,056 --> 01:18:59,726
What's going on here?
I'm shooting a commercial.

1054
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:02,312
Federal Marshals
acting on behalf of the IRS.

1055
01:19:02,521 --> 01:19:03,897
Bobby, call my lawyer.

1056
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:13,698
On November 28th,
at exactly 1400 hours -

1057
01:19:13,908 --> 01:19:18,162
- Operation Hell's Fury
swung into action.

1058
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:33,595
- Morning.
- Hi.

1059
01:19:33,804 --> 01:19:37,557
- How's my day shaping up?
- Poor Daddy, it's going to be hell.

1060
01:19:37,766 --> 01:19:40,060
Your 9 o'clock's waiting
in the conference room.

1061
01:19:40,269 --> 01:19:41,520
Okie-dokie.

1062
01:19:48,527 --> 01:19:49,861
So, where do I stand here now?

1063
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:53,823
We'll also bill the expenses
including but not limited to...

1064
01:19:56,244 --> 01:19:57,995
What is this?

1065
01:20:14,054 --> 01:20:16,139
Miss Eliot. Please...

1066
01:20:16,348 --> 01:20:20,310
- I'm begging you. Please.
- Brett, we love the new draft...

1067
01:20:20,519 --> 01:20:23,230
Phoebe's crazy about it.
She's going to read it.

1068
01:20:23,563 --> 01:20:24,897
Elise, I'm trying
to make a movie here.

1069
01:20:25,107 --> 01:20:27,401
- Hold your calls.
- That was an important phonecall.

1070
01:20:27,609 --> 01:20:31,988
- Where's my first check?
- Just sit down and shut up! OK?

1071
01:20:32,197 --> 01:20:35,116
Now, let's take a meeting.

1072
01:20:39,705 --> 01:20:42,624
- Hello, Sunshine!
- Welcome.

1073
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,292
This is kidnaping.

1074
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:46,170
I will crucify you.

1075
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:48,381
You want to talk crucifixion?

1076
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:50,549
Happy Easter, Morty.

1077
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,597
- Big deal!
- Letters from Brenda's father...

1078
01:20:56,806 --> 01:21:00,768
...about stocking your stores
with stolen merchandise.

1079
01:21:00,977 --> 01:21:04,522
- What do they call it in the tabloids?
- "Hot stuff".

1080
01:21:04,731 --> 01:21:08,067
Criminal activity.
You should be ashamed.

1081
01:21:08,276 --> 01:21:10,987
Wake up and smell the audit.

1082
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:15,158
Aaron, I just had
a little talk with Erik and Marc.

1083
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:17,994
It seems the business
is very dysfunctional.

1084
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:20,497
Sort of like our marriage.

1085
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:22,374
So...

1086
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:24,126
I bought them out.

1087
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:27,254
What?

1088
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:31,842
- Yeah, I think we ought to go.
- That's a good idea.

1089
01:21:32,176 --> 01:21:34,678
- Goodbye, Erik.
- Good luck to you.

1090
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:37,264
- Annie
- Oh, Marc.

1091
01:21:37,598 --> 01:21:40,100
- Love ya.
- I do love that suit.

1092
01:21:44,063 --> 01:21:48,025
You couldn't possibly pull off
something like this.

1093
01:21:48,234 --> 01:21:49,568
Where did you get
this kind of money?

1094
01:21:49,778 --> 01:21:53,031
As agreed, I sold our assets
to a friend of mine.

1095
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,200
Here's your half.

1096
01:21:56,451 --> 01:21:57,702
Fifty cents?

1097
01:21:58,036 --> 01:22:02,290
Considering our history together,
I thought a dollar was very fair.

1098
01:22:03,876 --> 01:22:08,672
Oh, all right!
Take it all.

1099
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:10,841
- What do you want? Money?
- Every cent.

1100
01:22:11,175 --> 01:22:12,634
You're out of your mind.

1101
01:22:12,843 --> 01:22:14,594
You can hand it over and live
happily ever after.

1102
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:17,431
You can give it to the government
and get 10 to 20.

1103
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,308
Maybe Duarto can do your cell.

1104
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:23,062
I see...bars.

1105
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,939
You can't do this to me.

1106
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:27,108
- But I have done it.
- You wouldn't.

1107
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,402
You...couldn't.

1108
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:33,072
It seems I could and I did.

1109
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,826
You know what, Aaron?
I forgot how much fun work can be.

1110
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,412
If you take my agency from me,
I'll walk.

1111
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:42,332
- I'll take my clients with me.
- Be my guest.

1112
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:46,086
I'm not kidding!
I will take every single account.

1113
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,131
This place without me....

1114
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:52,759
- It would be worthless.
- I don't think so, babe.

1115
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:57,347
Not after the new
$45,000,000 account I just landed.

1116
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,475
New account?
What account?

1117
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,686
Morty's Electronics will be
under my control.

1118
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,481
Advertising, marketing strategy...
Everything!

1119
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:10,820
You will stay on as President,
because after all...you are Morty.

1120
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:14,364
You will receive a salary which will
keep you in the lifestyle -

1121
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:17,994
- to which I think you should
become accustomed.

1122
01:23:18,328 --> 01:23:21,956
I don't see what else you can do.
It's this orjail.

1123
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:25,626
So I dumped you for another woman.
Get over it!

1124
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,212
Lift something. Wax something.
Have something peeled.

1125
01:23:28,547 --> 01:23:31,758
You're right!
I hate to admit it, but I'm jealous.

1126
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:36,346
Miss Lavelle is absolutely gorgeous.
She's a bright new star.

1127
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,683
lnterested, Elise?
Want to drink her blood?

1128
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:43,437
How old is she, Bill? 25? 26?

1129
01:23:43,646 --> 01:23:46,065
- 21.
- Yeah.

1130
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:51,361
In about five years!
She's 16.

1131
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:53,446
- What?
- Two years ago...

1132
01:23:53,656 --> 01:23:58,035
...she left high school
in Newkirk, Idaho.

1133
01:23:58,369 --> 01:24:01,372
Should've done your homework, Bill.
I did.

1134
01:24:01,581 --> 01:24:07,003
- A copy of her birth certificate.
- Oh, God. I didn't know.

1135
01:24:07,212 --> 01:24:09,839
My God!
What are you going to do?

1136
01:24:10,048 --> 01:24:13,885
What am I going to do?

1137
01:24:14,094 --> 01:24:20,141
Right now, I'm just using the "f" word.
Felony!

1138
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:23,895
I think we should continue
this discussion in my office.

1139
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:25,897
In your office?
Is that all you can do?

1140
01:24:26,106 --> 01:24:27,649
Think of yourself, yourself, yourself!

1141
01:24:27,983 --> 01:24:30,360
If you go through with this,
I'll have nothing.

1142
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:32,237
Everyone in town is looking
for the new guy.

1143
01:24:32,446 --> 01:24:33,697
How can I compete?

1144
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:36,742
Who else is going to want me?
I'm 46 years old.

1145
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:38,702
I'd have to start from scratch.

1146
01:24:39,036 --> 01:24:41,413
I know just how you feel.

1147
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:44,959
Oh, Aaron...

1148
01:24:49,255 --> 01:24:51,006
Grow from love.

1149
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,889
Annie McDuggan
FIRST WIVES CLUB

1150
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:02,686
I don't hate you. I wish I could.
But you're still kind of cute -

1151
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:07,482
- for a overbearing, cradle-robbing
Spandex-sucking criminal.

1152
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,567
So, I'm not going to take
all your money.

1153
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:11,444
Don't misunderstand.
I'm going to take plenty.

1154
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:16,032
And I'm going to hang onto these
because I have a favor to ask.

1155
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:18,451
Be there in two hours!

1156
01:25:18,661 --> 01:25:21,580
While we were married,
I helped you.

1157
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:23,874
Now it's your turn to help others.

1158
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,043
- Where are you going?
- To see Barbara Walters.

1159
01:25:26,252 --> 01:25:28,963
- Oh, my God!
- Scared?

1160
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:30,840
You won't talk about this,
will you?

1161
01:25:31,173 --> 01:25:33,341
That depends on you.

1162
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:37,012
Be there at that address
in two hours, babe!

1163
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:41,183
What Brenda meant by
thinking globally-

1164
01:25:41,392 --> 01:25:45,145
- was that it wasn't enough
to make our ex-husbands suffer.

1165
01:25:45,355 --> 01:25:48,483
To do the truly charitable,
unselfish thing -

1166
01:25:48,692 --> 01:25:51,486
- we'd have to make them
suffer over and over again.

1167
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:53,780
- So, what are you guys in for?
- Gentlemen!

1168
01:25:54,114 --> 01:25:56,616
And Daddy.

1169
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:11,507
Honey...what's going on?
I can't handle more surprises today.

1170
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:17,137
Oh, Daddy...

1171
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:20,599
I'm a lesbian...

1172
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:22,976
A big one.

1173
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:30,401
Gentlemen, we've brought you
here today for a specific reason.

1174
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:34,155
This is not about
retaliation or negotiation -

1175
01:26:34,364 --> 01:26:37,909
- and this is not about
men versus women.

1176
01:26:38,118 --> 01:26:41,329
What is it then?
I'm sick of this, OK.

1177
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:45,291
- Please don't make her mad.
- No, no, this is not a revenge thing.

1178
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,585
This is about justice.

1179
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,714
Halfway through this operation
we realized -

1180
01:26:51,048 --> 01:26:54,801
- the only people who'd be
helped by revenge would be us.

1181
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,346
- We'd be no better than you.
- Happier but no better.

1182
01:26:58,556 --> 01:27:01,767
Exhilarated but no better!
Ecstatic but no better!

1183
01:27:02,101 --> 01:27:03,352
So we thought again.

1184
01:27:03,561 --> 01:27:06,438
A very dear friend of ours
died from neglect.

1185
01:27:06,647 --> 01:27:09,816
You're going to help us make
sure that never happens again.

1186
01:27:10,026 --> 01:27:12,320
- Like hell we are.
- Can't make us.

1187
01:27:12,528 --> 01:27:15,864
No... but Vito can. Joey can.

1188
01:27:16,032 --> 01:27:18,451
And Uncle Carmine can.

1189
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,504
- What do we have to do?
- You have to pay.

1190
01:30:01,078 --> 01:30:03,789
The funny thing was when we finally
had our ex's just where we wanted -

1191
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:06,625
- revenge didn't seem so important.

1192
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:10,170
So, we came up
with something better.

1193
01:30:14,634 --> 01:30:18,930
It's an important day here
in New York City for all women -

1194
01:30:19,138 --> 01:30:23,809
- at the opening of the Cynthia Griffin
Crisis Center for Women.

1195
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:28,606
It's an amazing facility and I'm
here talking to three amazing women.

1196
01:30:28,815 --> 01:30:31,234
Please tell me about your facility.

1197
01:30:31,443 --> 01:30:36,323
This center is dedicated in memory
to our very dear friend Cynthia Swann.

1198
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:39,242
We plan on offering counseling -

1199
01:30:39,451 --> 01:30:43,538
- family therapy and, of course,
abuse intervention for all.

1200
01:30:43,747 --> 01:30:46,458
So many women are
in need here in Manhattan.

1201
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:51,255
Can I ask whether it's true that the
idea for this center started because -

1202
01:30:51,463 --> 01:30:54,883
- each of you had a husband
that left you for a younger woman?

1203
01:30:55,217 --> 01:30:56,551
Yes, yes.

1204
01:30:56,886 --> 01:30:59,889
They really are amazing women.
Good for you!

1205
01:31:00,097 --> 01:31:04,267
Congratulations for all the great work.
New York thanks you.

1206
01:31:12,527 --> 01:31:16,364
I'm asking you as a favor.
Come in for one minute with me.

1207
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:19,825
- We have to talk about the wedding.
- What are you talking about?

1208
01:31:20,035 --> 01:31:21,786
- You won't even set a date.
- Exactly.

1209
01:31:21,995 --> 01:31:24,914
Because this isn't working.
I am not feeling special.

1210
01:31:25,123 --> 01:31:29,085
I am not feeling loved.
And now this place.

1211
01:31:29,294 --> 01:31:32,213
Morty, I am not Brenda.

1212
01:31:33,382 --> 01:31:36,385
- No, you're not!
- Duh!

1213
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:06,833
Ivana...

1214
01:32:07,876 --> 01:32:10,503
I want to thank you
for coming so much.

1215
01:32:10,712 --> 01:32:12,463
- You're an angel.
- Of course, Elise.

1216
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,131
Thank you so much again.

1217
01:32:14,341 --> 01:32:16,635
Ladies, you have to be strong
and independent.

1218
01:32:16,843 --> 01:32:18,719
- And remember?
- What?

1219
01:32:18,929 --> 01:32:21,556
Don't get mad.
Get everything!

1220
01:32:26,145 --> 01:32:28,230
- Mrs. Goldberg?
- Yes.

1221
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:31,150
Carmine Morelli...
Brenda's uncle.

1222
01:32:32,067 --> 01:32:35,403
- Yes, of course.
- Nice to meet you.

1223
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:48,876
What a wonderful occasion!
Helping people through a buffet!

1224
01:32:49,085 --> 01:32:51,462
- Mom, it's a great party.
- Thank you, sweetie.

1225
01:32:51,671 --> 01:32:56,592
You know, Annie,
this place is terrific.

1226
01:32:56,801 --> 01:33:00,763
I think you did the right thing,
divorcing Aaron.

1227
01:33:00,972 --> 01:33:02,932
I salute you.

1228
01:33:03,141 --> 01:33:04,600
I have something to add.

1229
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:09,189
Annie, you're not
getting any younger. Or thinner.

1230
01:33:09,523 --> 01:33:13,276
- You know what I think you need?
- No.

1231
01:33:13,485 --> 01:33:15,445
Absolutely nothing!

1232
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,910
Baby...
Sweetheart!

1233
01:33:29,627 --> 01:33:32,338
Come on, Jason.
Just one time around the floor.

1234
01:33:32,547 --> 01:33:36,217
- Come on. Get real.
- I'm your mother. I command you.

1235
01:33:36,426 --> 01:33:39,220
You gotta have something
to tell your shrink.

1236
01:33:42,974 --> 01:33:45,810
Look at this.
Isn't this fantastic? I'm so proud.

1237
01:33:46,019 --> 01:33:47,353
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Morty.

1238
01:33:47,562 --> 01:33:50,815
Dad, save me.
She's trying to dance with me.

1239
01:33:51,024 --> 01:33:52,483
Leave him alone.
He's a good kid.

1240
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:55,487
- I know that.
- Not like his Dad.

1241
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:59,032
- What?
- I'm getting out of the line of fire.

1242
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:07,291
- You look good, Bren.
- You too.

1243
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,877
- Thank you.
- Where's Shel?

1244
01:34:10,086 --> 01:34:12,713
- In the car.
- Glove compartment?

1245
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:15,298
Trunk.

1246
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:19,386
Let me ask you a question.

1247
01:34:19,595 --> 01:34:20,929
Was I this old
when we were married?

1248
01:34:21,264 --> 01:34:24,392
Yes. But I liked you this old.

1249
01:34:24,601 --> 01:34:26,352
Me too.

1250
01:34:44,288 --> 01:34:46,373
- Wanna?
- Sure.

1251
01:34:51,921 --> 01:34:57,134
It was clear that Brenda and Morty
were headed for a reconciliation.

1252
01:34:57,343 --> 01:35:00,054
Elise was dating an actor
in her hit play.

1253
01:35:00,262 --> 01:35:03,682
As for me,
Aaron and Dr. Rosen split up.

1254
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:06,935
He wants to come home again
and he feels emotionally ready-

1255
01:35:07,145 --> 01:35:11,399
- to recommit to an equitable
and caring relationship.

1256
01:35:11,733 --> 01:35:14,110
I told him to drop dead.

1257
01:35:22,994 --> 01:35:26,622
- Excuse me, got a light?
- Sure.

1258
01:35:26,832 --> 01:35:31,002
- Nice car. Used to have one myself.
- Thanks.

1259
01:35:31,211 --> 01:35:35,173
So, what's going on in there? Is it just
lot of battered women dancing?

1260
01:35:35,507 --> 01:35:38,009
Yeah, sort of.
Not really my scene.

1261
01:35:38,218 --> 01:35:39,969
Me, neither.

1262
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:43,515
So, you here with anybody?

1263
01:35:44,892 --> 01:35:48,645
- Not really.
- How old are you?

1264
01:35:51,148 --> 01:35:54,985
Look at this place.
It's just a total mess.

1265
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:59,281
- But a gorgeous mess.
- You know, I can't believe it.

1266
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:03,952
We actually did it.
We accomplished it together.

1267
01:36:04,162 --> 01:36:06,372
I know. We did it.

1268
01:36:06,581 --> 01:36:10,126
Oh, God,
I wish Cynthia was here.

1269
01:36:10,335 --> 01:36:12,921
She is...
She is in a way.

1270
01:36:15,132 --> 01:36:18,552
OK, we're 1990s women.
What is it we really, really need?

1271
01:36:18,886 --> 01:36:22,306
- You are never going to change.
- And I hope not.

1272
01:36:22,514 --> 01:36:25,558
I hope we never change
and we always stay the same...

1273
01:36:25,768 --> 01:36:27,853
Tired and happy.

1274
01:36:28,062 --> 01:36:31,190
- Maybe a little bit brave.
- Brave?

1275
01:36:31,398 --> 01:36:34,526
- You mean, "brave".
- What do you mean?

1276
01:36:37,029 --> 01:36:39,531
- You don't own me
-You're not funny!

1277
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:41,199
No way. I'm out.

1278
01:36:42,243 --> 01:36:44,954
Stop it! No, I'm not gonna...

1279
01:36:45,246 --> 01:36:48,290
- You don't own me
- Leave me alone.

1280
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:52,045
Don't say I can't go
with other boys

1281
01:36:53,088 --> 01:36:56,216
