1
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:50,706
Charlie?

2
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:55,476
Charlie, come on.

3
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,993
Not going to the funeral?

4
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:03,594
No, didn't know her, really.

5
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:05,263
Is that on credit?

6
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:07,459
Unfortunately.

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,934
Makes you think, though.

8
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:12,737
Certainly does.
Wonder what he'll say at my funeral.

9
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:16,799
Something nice, I'm sure.

10
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,610
There you are.

11
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,305
Sorry.

12
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:27,351
Good boy.

13
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,453
That's it.

14
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,588
Good boy.

15
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:33,250
That's it.

16
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,623
Come on.

17
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:38,286
Here we go.

18
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,099
No! No! Charlie, no!

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,227
Oh, no.

20
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:48,204
Oh, you bloody bugger.

21
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,033
Want some juice?

22
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,114
How much did that cost?

23
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:58,082
I don't know.
A few bucks.

24
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,052
Yeah? Used every
fucking cent we got, Dale.

25
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:04,288
Well, I'll put it on my card, Ron.

26
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,990
No.

27
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:08,059
They can trace after us.

28
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,261
Give me the cash.

29
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:12,630
Let's do a runner.

30
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,265
They've seen the car, Ron.

31
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,601
Now give me the cash...

32
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,536
and I'll sort it out.

33
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:21,528
It's only a few bucks.

34
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,478
Listen, you either pay me
the right money...

35
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,579
or I'll call the cops.

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,747
<i>It's $4.50.</i>

37
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:31,949
Fine.

38
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,714
Look, I hate to put you
in this situation.

39
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,189
Is there anything I could do...

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,386
that might square things up?

41
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:49,934
You'd be all right until about nightfall.

42
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,732
Here we go.

43
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,262
Jesus, Ron!

44
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:20,631
Are you out of your fucking mind?

45
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:22,565
He was calling the cops!

46
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,231
You gave him a blow job?

47
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:17,555
What was that back there?

48
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,357
What the fuck were you thinking?

49
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,393
What is Joey doing
in the boot of the car?

50
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:23,794
What'd you want me to do with him...

51
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,796
leave him in the fucking car park, Dale?

52
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,865
I'm trying to get you
out of that life, Dale...

53
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,233
and the first chance you get,

54
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,435
<i>you're giving a blow
to some servo attendant for 4.50!</i>

55
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,070
It was a fucking handjob, Ron.

56
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,538
Pardon me.
Same difference.

57
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,307
It's a big fucking difference.

58
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:39,800
One's with the hand,
and one's with the mouth.

59
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,446
Shit. Shit, Ron.

60
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:45,283
- Fucking turn off! Turn off!
- Just sit still and stay calm, all right?

61
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,284
Don't shoot anybody, Ron.

62
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,979
- Don't fucking shoot any...
- Shut up!

63
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:57,191
All right, we're gonna dump the car.

64
00:04:58,163 --> 00:04:59,830
It's okay, baby.

65
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,593
It's okay.

66
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,342
That's nice.

67
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,744
We should be able to hot-wire it.

68
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,384
Maybe the keys are in the house.

69
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,648
Come on.

70
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,519
Hey, Ron.

71
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:11,896
What...

72
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:14,126
what are you doing here?

73
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,268
- No!
- Ron, no!

74
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,069
- Please don't hurt me.
- Shut up!

75
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,771
What's your name, asshole?

76
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,573
- Andrew.
- Andrew?

77
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:23,674
Asshole.

78
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:25,409
I was close, wasn't I?

79
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,610
Give me your wallet.

80
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:28,339
Get it out!

81
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,050
That's it?

82
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,719
Where are your car keys?

83
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,588
In the box on the table over there.

84
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,078
Get them, babe.

85
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,793
Here, hold that.

86
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:45,896
Get on your stomach.

87
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,331
Come on!

88
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,060
- You alone?
- Yes.

89
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:52,803
All right?

90
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,371
Look for some cash
or something.

91
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:56,134
All right.

92
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,433
Shit.

93
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:58,469
Oh, my God.

94
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,665
Yeah!

95
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,679
Yes.

96
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,240
Hurry up, Dale!

97
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,765
We're out of here!

98
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:43,981
Here's the plan, and...

99
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,116
You're gonna drive us up North.

100
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:49,286
Dale is going to be in the boot
until we get out of Bowral...

101
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,322
and I'm going to be
right behind you...

102
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:54,091
with my shotty sticking
straight up your ass.

103
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,126
When we get to Queensland...

104
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,228
you're going to pull
over to an auto teller...

105
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:00,731
and you're going to withdraw
up to your limit.

106
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,701
Now, I'm doing this
because, you see...

107
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:07,004
my girlfriend,
she's got a soft heart.

108
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:09,006
But if it was up to me...

109
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,872
you'd be dead already.

110
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,544
Am I getting through to you, Andy?

111
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,881
I can't.

112
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,950
No, really, you can.

113
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,819
No, you don't understand, I'm...

114
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,988
No, you don't understand.

115
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,717
So?

116
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,227
What do you think?

117
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,462
Women.

118
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,663
We need cash, Dale.

119
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,964
There isn't none.

120
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:37,229
God, you are fucking killing me.

121
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,675
No, please no!

122
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,176
I can't go outside! Please!

123
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,578
No! Please!

124
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,346
I'm afraid of open spaces.
I can't go outside!

125
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,015
Yeah? Well, I'm afraid...

126
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:52,416
of enclosed spaces, like jail!

127
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,617
Please!

128
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,086
No!

129
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:59,078
Get out!

130
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,725
Get up!

131
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:04,495
You're being
a very bad hostage.

132
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,597
Come on!
Get up now.

133
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:07,865
Fuck!

134
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:08,866
Coppers!

135
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:11,130
Get back.

136
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,833
Come back inside, Andy.

137
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,904
Come back
in the house, Andy!

138
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,716
Come in the house, Andy!

139
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,707
Come on, Andy.

140
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,149
Pills.

141
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,363
- My pills.
- What the fuck?

142
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,196
Bathroom... bathroom drawer.

143
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,862
Shit.

144
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,183
Servos, jumpers...

145
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,151
We've got it.

146
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,662
- What the fuck is the matter with him?
- He's agoraphobic.

147
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:12,996
Agora what?

148
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,362
I don't know,
he says he can't go outside.

149
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,406
No, no!

150
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:24,932
No!

151
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:35,619
Please!

152
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,954
He said he can't go outside.

153
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,422
He's outside now!

154
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,894
Bloody human boomerang.

155
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,839
Shit.

156
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:37,247
All right...

157
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:39,383
We just keep our heads down for a bit.

158
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:40,984
A day or so, they'll call it off...

159
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:44,045
and then we can get
the hell out of here.

160
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,348
Ron?

161
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,228
Where's the remote?

162
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,594
Where is it?

163
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:56,763
Fuck!

164
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,395
Fuck!

165
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:05,674
They got my face.

166
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,582
If we just done a runner,
when I said so...

167
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,250
we'd be halfway there...

168
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:15,185
but no, you got to sort it out.

169
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:17,221
Well, we're fucking sorted now,
aren't we?

170
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,923
Dead guy at the service station...

171
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,959
and our hostage is going
to go the same way.

172
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,260
No, he's not.

173
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,928
You're never killing him.

174
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,263
You're right.

175
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,298
It's about time you did
your own dirty work.

176
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,534
You know how I promised, remember?

177
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,870
I'm not doing that.

178
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:36,173
Bet you're not, you lazy bitch.

179
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,374
I'm not lazy.

180
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,878
I'm not the only one
that says so, all right?

181
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,846
I am not lazy.

182
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:47,584
Come on, stop it.

183
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,920
Don't touch me.

184
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,389
Oh, babe, come on.

185
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,358
Go then!

186
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,559
Fucking hell.

187
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,994
I won't forget this, you prick.

188
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:02,497
Dale!

189
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,512
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,344
I'm not fucking lazy, Ron.

191
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,918
I might be a pig, all right?

192
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,121
I'm a fucking pig...

193
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,622
that loves you.

194
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,681
I just like you the way you are.

195
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,033
Not dressed up like a champion.

196
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,502
Bitch.

197
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,971
You know?

198
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,578
I want to do some nasty,
nasty shit to you.

199
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,297
You're not wearing any undies.

200
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:10,733
You don't wear undies
in a dress like this.

201
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,715
You're bloody so fucking hot.

202
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,497
Yeah? Do you want me to fuck you?

203
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:41,965
Yeah.

204
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:05,922
You got a death wish?

205
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:07,691
Because I can grant it, dickhead.

206
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:11,061
No worries at all.

207
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:13,697
I've thought of a way...

208
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:16,223
I can get you $40,000.00.

209
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,471
Say that again.

210
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:24,908
I can get you $40,000.00...

211
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,603
in two days.

212
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:29,479
What are you doing?

213
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,880
Our friend Andy
just made a proposition.

214
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,887
This better be good.

215
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:41,091
It's a trust fund
that my mother set up.

216
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,292
That must be nice.

217
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:46,663
And this just tops up every fortnight.

218
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:47,931
Bullshit!

219
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:50,233
Look, all we have to do
is take the first check...

220
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,701
to the bank tomorrow...

221
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:55,205
and they will give you $20,000.00

222
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,774
Then when the account
is topped up overnight,

223
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:01,445
you take the second
check in on the Tuesday.

224
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,380
Look, the local bank
knows about my condition...

225
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,882
and they will call here
for a password.

226
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,652
Once I speak to them,
they will pay out in full...

227
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:13,190
and you will have
$40,000.00 in your hand.

228
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:14,991
Who does this for you normally?

229
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:17,119
Lilly, my housekeeper.

230
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:21,264
As if they're going
to give us 20 grand in cash!

231
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:24,427
They will if...

232
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,300
If you become my fiancée.

233
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,275
- I don't look nothing like her.
- Let him finish.

234
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:33,577
When I walked in that first time...

235
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:34,778
when I saw you standing there...

236
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:35,846
I'm not doing it.

237
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,948
You were so just like...

238
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:40,383
Look, Gabrielle's only been
to Bowral a couple of times.

239
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:42,052
If you were to dye
your hair blonde...

240
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,921
- Where is this fiancée?
- She's overseas.

241
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:45,922
- She's...
- Ron!

242
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:48,823
Babe!

243
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:52,961
Is your fiancée really
as pretty as my Dale here?

244
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,866
That dress is a perfect fit, isn't it?

245
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,201
I'm not doing it, I'll get caught!

246
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:01,638
Why am I the only one that
has to take a risk, huh?

247
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,369
This is typical of you.

248
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,443
Can't do a bloody thing.

249
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:08,378
Just take a look at me.

250
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,608
Now look around you.

251
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:16,182
I could never be her.

252
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:19,456
Ron, I really don't think...

253
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,822
that's the way to talk to her.

254
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,128
Andy, I really don't think...

255
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,119
that's the way to talk to Ron.

256
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:30,094
Dale?

257
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,767
Hey, you.

258
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,603
I'm scared.

259
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:45,182
I know you are, babe.

260
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,275
I'm scared, too.

261
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,004
Shit.

262
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,830
<i>Ferrari 360.</i>

263
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:10,198
<i>He's a fantastic character, too...</i>

264
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,405
Grow up, Andy.

265
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,246
So what's she like, this chick?

266
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:59,015
Does she talk like you?

267
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,778
I suppose so.

268
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:08,091
You can look at me, Andy.

269
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:09,526
You never been to a strip club?

270
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,194
No, I haven't.

271
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:14,264
So how long has she been away?

272
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:16,099
Six months.

273
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,500
You don't worry she got her legs...

274
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,536
wrapped around
some other guy by now?

275
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:21,905
- No. She's not like that.
- Like what?

276
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:24,067
Normal?

277
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:27,544
Like you.

278
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,337
Let me tell you something, Andy.

279
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:36,145
They're all like me.

280
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,924
<i>Well! What do you know?</i>

281
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,949
<i>Another rainbow!</i>

282
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:00,803
Where's my gun?

283
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,713
Fuck!

284
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,841
<i>I knew it!
Pot of gold!</i>

285
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:21,765
If you even wink at these pricks...

286
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,233
- you're fucked!
- What's going on?

287
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,034
Cops are at the door.

288
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,524
Oh, fuck!

289
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,342
Say anything you want.
Just get rid of him.

290
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,676
I've killed two people.

291
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:36,668
I got nothing to lose.

292
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,490
Mr. Shepard?

293
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:48,792
Yes?

294
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,093
How can I help you?

295
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:52,929
I'm Sergeant Widdens,
this is Constable Blarney.

296
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,331
We're with the Bowral Police.

297
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:58,701
Your housekeeper got in touch with us.

298
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,970
She reckons she hasn't
been able to raise you.

299
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,039
Oh...

300
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,308
- You all right, Mr. Shepard?
- Yes, I'm fine.

301
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,606
Would you prefer if we came inside?

302
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:18,455
I've been overdoing it a bit.

303
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:22,058
My fiancée rang a few days ago.

304
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,958
She's met someone else.

305
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:27,796
She's coming here
to pick up her things.

306
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,601
Yeah, well...

307
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,337
I know how these things
can get on top of you...

308
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:36,005
but if you could call her,
I'd appreciate it.

309
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,667
I'm really sorry to have troubled you.

310
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,452
You did it.

311
00:24:58,362 --> 00:24:59,954
The cop car hasn't started.

312
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:24,850
The boss reckons
they're up North by now.

313
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:28,418
Yeah.

314
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,353
Oh, well.

315
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:35,558
He's the boss.

316
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,238
<i>Hello?</i>

317
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,940
Yes, hello, Lilly?

318
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:45,241
It's Andrew.

319
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:47,977
Yes, I'm sorry,
but thanks for your concern.

320
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:50,680
No, I was actually really touched.

321
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:52,649
No, I should have called.

322
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,350
Listen.

323
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,052
I... If you...

324
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,922
I don't want you to come in tomorrow
if that's all right.

325
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,558
No, next Tuesday will be fine.

326
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,626
You know, the usual...

327
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:05,361
personal things, Lilly.

328
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:07,230
All right, then, well, next week.

329
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:08,331
Okay.

330
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:10,493
Thank you.
Bye-bye now. Bye!

331
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,440
You did good.

332
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:21,001
You know, you could make
a very good crim.

333
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,513
You have earned yourself a shower.

334
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,656
Frittata!

335
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:36,492
How are you going to live in Thailand
if you can't eat real food?

336
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:39,596
I've had Thai, okay?

337
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,365
This is just an omelet for wankers!

338
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,800
I reckon he's a poofter.

339
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,000
Haven't you noticed?
He likes it when I tie him up.

340
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,139
Take me hostage.

341
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,448
What?

342
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,117
You're so cute
when you're an idiot.

343
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:03,984
Don't call me cute all right?

344
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:08,246
Kittens are cute.

345
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,872
There's hair dye in the cabinet.

346
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,007
The bathroom is free now
if you need it.

347
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:01,443
I'm done.

348
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:07,144
Take out the belly button ring.

349
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,196
What?

350
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:24,333
You're beautiful.

351
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:26,131
Yeah?

352
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,433
Well, just keep
your hands to yourself.

353
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:49,618
You are perfect.

354
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:55,031
A spot-on upper-class bitch.

355
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:56,766
<i>...has been linked
to the abduction...</i>

356
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,325
Shit.

357
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,071
<i>He disappeared from
outside his club...</i>

358
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,673
<i>in the early hours
of Sunday morning.</i>

359
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:06,609
<i>Police believe
he has been wounded...</i>

360
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,611
<i>and may be in a serious condition.</i>

361
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:10,346
<i>In a tragic twist...</i>

362
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:11,547
<i>service station attendant
Terrance Gilmore...</i>

363
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:14,550
<i>was apparently murdered
yesterday afternoon.</i>

364
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,220
<i>Police have released
this photo of a man...</i>

365
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,489
<i>wanted for questioning
in relation to both matters.</i>

366
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,825
<i>He is 28-year-old
Ronald Jason Beron.</i>

367
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:25,628
<i>He is described
as armed and dangerous.</i>

368
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:28,030
<i>Beron is believed
to be traveling with a woman...</i>

369
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:31,400
<i>described as a brunette,
and in her early twenties.</i>

370
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:34,337
<i>Police believe the couple
may still be in the area.</i>

371
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:36,572
<i>In other news,
Prime Minister John Howard...</i>

372
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:38,938
<i>is meeting with cabinet today.</i>

373
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:41,410
They think your dickhead boss
is alive.

374
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:43,346
That's why the choppers.

375
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:44,814
I can't go out there.

376
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:49,652
All right, that didn't look like you,
you're fine.

377
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,120
They're looking for a blue ute...

378
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:53,756
that we are not driving anymore.

379
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:54,924
Don't make me do it.

380
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:56,759
Babe, they're looking
for a brunette...

381
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,728
and you have blonde hair.

382
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,530
They're looking for a couple.

383
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:01,931
You're going to be on your own.

384
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:04,000
It's just shit that they
put out just to rattle us.

385
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,601
That's all.

386
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:08,171
Can't I go tomorrow?

387
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,640
Listen, if you do not go today...

388
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,141
and tomorrow...

389
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,177
we have to stay here
for another two weeks.

390
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,838
I can't go out there.

391
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:25,417
Well, I can't do it, can I?

392
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:33,596
You're doing it.

393
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:34,764
If you don't do this...

394
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:36,499
you might as well kiss
our future good-bye.

395
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,024
And don't cry.

396
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:55,378
That's my father
and that's Heather.

397
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,122
<i>- Gold.
- Gold, Andy, gold!</i>

398
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:02,825
<i>You didn't tell anyone?</i>

399
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:05,394
<i>Not for a couple of years,
and when the list came up...</i>

400
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:06,762
<i>I bought it.</i>

401
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:09,432
<i>I never looked back.</i>

402
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:12,101
<i>- Your father, the rogue.
- Trust me...</i>

403
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:13,836
You don't want to see that.

404
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,738
Your dad's an Aussie?

405
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:18,341
What the bloody hell
happened to you?

406
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:20,901
Your father's a rogue.

407
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:24,847
Wasn't that it?

408
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,082
It was perfect.

409
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,817
Gabrielle doesn't smoke, though.

410
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:28,851
Yeah, well, I do.

411
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,512
Hey.

412
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,547
Say something else.

413
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:40,196
Would you please cash this for me?

414
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:41,664
Would you...
Open your mouth.

415
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,232
Try and make the words more discreet.

416
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,034
Fuck off!

417
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:48,037
No one's going to believe I went
to some posh-ass school anyway.

418
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:50,006
Class is an attitude.
It's not about you.

419
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,941
Why don't you imagine
that everybody you meet...

420
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,709
is younger than you are...

421
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,378
like they're 12.

422
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:59,482
Everyone you meet knows less
about the world than you do.

423
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:03,052
Would you please cash this for me?

424
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:04,253
Very good.

425
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:07,484
Good afternoon,
my name is Gabrielle Martin.

426
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,859
Good afternoon,
my name is Gabrielle Martin.

427
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,427
Perfect.

428
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:13,896
All right, school's over.

429
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,421
Let's go.

430
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,270
Good afternoon, I'm Miss Martin.

431
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:24,103
I have this check for you to cash.

432
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,375
Good afternoon,
I'm Gabrielle Martin.

433
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:29,674
I have this check for you to cash.

434
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:41,223
If you get stopped...

435
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:43,658
just tell them that you
picked up your old license.

436
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,156
It's just a fine.

437
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,335
Ronald, would you be a darling
and bring the car up for me?

438
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:53,836
Oh, sure, Miss...

439
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:56,237
Miss Martin.

440
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,907
Be right with you.

441
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:13,122
You know I wouldn't let you go...

442
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:15,024
if I didn't think you could do it.

443
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:16,826
You just want to live, that's all.

444
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,494
Yes.

445
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,587
I do.

446
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,728
That's why I'm not worried about you.

447
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,475
So.

448
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:35,011
How do I look?

449
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,501
Gum.

450
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:05,574
Don't, Ronnie.
My lipstick.

451
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:38,500
Did a good job, Andy.

452
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:41,433
I hardly recognized her.

453
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:43,512
Glad you approve.

454
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:46,277
Oh, I didn't say that, did I?

455
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:51,613
So you enjoy yourself up there?

456
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:55,424
Dressing her up?

457
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:57,586
Doing her hair?

458
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,830
Hey, And, you can admit it.

459
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,032
She's hot. Right?

460
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:04,266
She's very sweet.

461
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:05,534
Come on, And!

462
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:07,670
You've been checking her out
ever since we got here.

463
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,071
No, I haven't. I...

464
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:11,373
You sayin' she's a dog?

465
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:13,275
No, of course I'm not.

466
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:14,844
So you have been checking her out.

467
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,545
No. She's your girl, Ron...

468
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:18,214
That's right, And!

469
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:21,149
That's right.
She's my girl.

470
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,920
And you wanna fuck her.

471
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,155
No, no. It's not true.

472
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:28,691
You think she's hot?

473
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:31,093
- And you'd like to fuck her.
- No, Ron.

474
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:32,294
You think she's hot,
and you'd like...

475
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:33,596
- to fuck her.
- No!

476
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,297
You think she's hot,
and you'd like...

477
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:36,599
- to fuck her!
- No, Ron!

478
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,033
You wanna fuck her,
don't ya? Yeah, Andy!

479
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:39,135
Come on!
You wanna fuck her!

480
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,703
Yes! All right! Yes!

481
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:43,604
I'm only fucking with you, Andy.

482
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:49,738
But maybe I'm not.

483
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,934
Next, please.

484
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:26,672
Next, please!

485
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:31,519
I've got this check
for you to cash.

486
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:39,753
I... I've left...

487
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,333
Shit.

488
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:01,243
It's a lovely piece, that.

489
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,919
Dressed in porcelain in Amalou.

490
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,554
That's 1780.

491
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,524
It's quite unusual. Look.

492
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:10,226
It's lovely.

493
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,861
Are you after anything
in particular?

494
00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:15,164
No, just browsing.

495
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:17,266
Of course. Feel free.

496
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,791
Do you live locally?

497
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:23,038
Yes.

498
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,473
We're just out of town.

499
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:26,575
Well, look, let me get
you one of my cards.

500
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:29,078
I have contacts here
and overseas...

501
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,280
so often, if you're after
something specific...

502
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,215
I can source it for you.

503
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:36,082
But next time, you might want
to bring your partner in...

504
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:38,320
Or not.

505
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:46,362
I have this check
for you to cash.

506
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,262
Sure.

507
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:07,946
Now, your chick...

508
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:11,078
She's hot.

509
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:17,192
I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

510
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:18,494
- No.
- Good.

511
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:20,462
Because I'd really
like to fuck her.

512
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,191
I bet you she'd be
a goer, too. Huh?

513
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:30,306
She like it hard and fast?

514
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,831
Am I right?

515
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:36,377
She like a bit of dirty talk,
you know?

516
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:39,148
She like it when
you call her a slut?

517
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:42,551
Just when you're into it?
You know?

518
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:45,120
Just before she comes?

519
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:48,924
Give her a bit of, "You slut".

520
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,824
"You bitch".

521
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:53,887
She'd love that, wouldn't she?

522
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,964
What's she like
in the rumpy department, and?

523
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,505
She a moaner?

524
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:06,575
Or a screamer?

525
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:08,703
I bet you she's a screamer.

526
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,008
You're losing her, Ron.

527
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:18,854
- What?
- She's bored already.

528
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:20,989
- Haven't you noticed?
- Shut the fuck up.

529
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,720
She's slipping away.

530
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:29,928
How does that feel?

531
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:34,903
Knowing that you're...

532
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:38,307
not... quite...

533
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:39,775
adequate?

534
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:03,523
Come on!

535
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:29,289
If the phone rings out,
you're dead.

536
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,230
<i>- Hello?
- Andrew Shepard.</i>

537
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:36,432
Frank, yes.

538
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,767
<i>I need to verify some I.D.</i>

539
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,792
Gabrielle Elizabeth Martin.

540
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:43,839
Yes, it's my fiancée.

541
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,500
Okay. And password.

542
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,877
Restraint.

543
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:50,572
<i>All right.</i>

544
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:52,781
<i>- Good.
- Yes.</i>

545
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:54,283
Thank you. Yes.

546
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:55,551
We're gonna be doing
this again tomorrow.

547
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,585
Is that all right?

548
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:58,144
<i>Yes. That's fine.</i>

549
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:06,562
Want your license back?

550
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,430
We don't have anything larger.

551
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,922
So that's 10, 12, 14...

552
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:14,265
16, 18...

553
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,765
19, and 20,000.00

554
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:23,236
Thank you.

555
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:37,759
Miss?

556
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,522
Excuse me. Miss.

557
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:44,066
This your car?

558
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,535
It belongs to my fiancé.

559
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,569
The door was unlocked.

560
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:56,106
I wouldn't do that around here.

561
00:41:57,046 --> 00:41:59,741
Sorry.

562
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,988
Here's my money.

563
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:51,667
I did it. I actually did it, Andy.

564
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:54,636
It was extraordinary. They believed
everything that I was saying.

565
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,471
You know, they treated me
like I was someone special!

566
00:42:56,472 --> 00:42:58,407
That's what I'm talkin' about, Andy.

567
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:01,476
You feel alive, huh?
You did good, baby!

568
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:04,046
You did good!

569
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,248
I just felt so comfortable.

570
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,650
Just shows, when one makes
a little bit of effort...

571
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:10,152
with your appearance and whatnot...

572
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:12,054
and the attitude, darling...

573
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:14,189
the attitude of those around you
completely changes.

574
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,258
Yeah, well, you can
drop the attitude now.

575
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:18,093
She's amongst friends now,
isn't she, Andy?

576
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:20,596
Sorry, darling.
To what attitude do you refer?

577
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:22,030
The attitude, babe!

578
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,556
The accent, all right?
It's not funny!

579
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:26,768
I knew you could do it.

580
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:28,837
You could almost be her.

581
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,305
Gold!

582
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:33,805
We are celebrating tonight, my friends!

583
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,956
You ever order in, Andy?

584
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:54,691
- I'm sorry?
- You know.

585
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:56,532
Whores.

586
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,668
Hoochie mamas.

587
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,227
You getting me?

588
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,074
What?

589
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,676
Six months without a screw?

590
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:09,112
No wonder you're tropo, mate!

591
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,048
Come on, And. You gotta learn
to live a little, you know?

592
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,683
I mean, look at that.

593
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:14,817
Now that's a disgrace, man.

594
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,047
You've been on that all night.

595
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,023
No wonder.

596
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,187
Hang on.

597
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,025
I know what you need.

598
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,204
Now where's the ice cream?

599
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,140
In the chest freezer, on the side.

600
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,665
By the fridge.

601
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,985
Can I introduce you
to a titillating sensation?

602
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,633
That's a hundred dollars a bottle, Ron.

603
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,134
There's some cheap stuff
in the fridge...

604
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,330
Fuck the cheap stuff.
We're celebrating, mate!

605
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:21,045
I give you... the champagne spider.

606
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,860
It's like poetry.

607
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,829
Come on. Give your
Master Tom a good swipe.

608
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,996
I really don't think it's my...

609
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,158
Oh, and you haven't even tried it!

610
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,866
Come on.

611
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,542
Well, I'll be damned.

612
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,778
Isn't that some gourmet shit?

613
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,371
Drink up, lads!

614
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,655
So what's with all
the paintings, mate?

615
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,384
You an art dealer?

616
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,528
I used to be.
I'm more of a collector now.

617
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,529
Right.

618
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,532
With your private income.

619
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,466
That's right.

620
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,903
I was also a dealer.

621
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,466
Dad was a druggie.

622
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,209
Your old man's in mining, right?

623
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,344
Among other things.

624
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,445
Little tension between
you and the old man, is there?

625
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,393
How about your mum?

626
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:40,454
She died a few years ago.

627
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,335
Sorry to hear it.

628
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,437
Mine's still around.

629
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,839
She breeds dogs.

630
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,604
That's what I'm gonna do, too.

631
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,783
Back.

632
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,052
Now what sort, you reckon?

633
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,188
- I have no idea, Ron.
- Just have a guess.

634
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,689
- I don't know...
- Go on, have a guess!

635
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,055
- I really don't know.
- Have a guess! Play the game!

636
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,654
Play the game.

637
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,894
Rottweilers? Pit bulls?

638
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,602
Poodles, mate.

639
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,070
Miniatures.

640
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,139
That's what I'm using
your money for in Thailand.

641
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,707
I'm gonna start my own kennel.

642
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,743
Look anywhere in Asia now.
What do you see?

643
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,879
Gucci. McDonald's.
Coca-fucking-Cola.

644
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,914
You see, they get to a certain level...

645
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,144
and they all want to be white.

646
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,286
Jesus, Ron!

647
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,888
You shut up, babe! Look.

648
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,924
Mercedes Benz.
Little bloody poodles!

649
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,360
Every little yellow bastard
is gonna want one...

650
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,262
either as a pet...

651
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,788
or on the barbie.

652
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,701
What?

653
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,540
I like it, Ron.

654
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,208
I think it's a very good idea.

655
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,210
I knew you'd get it!

656
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,379
- What's this one?
- It's jazz.

657
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,814
New Orleans-style.

658
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,315
- How do you play it?
- You don't.

659
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,217
It's never been played.
It's a first edition.

660
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,220
What's the point of having a record
if not you're gonna play it?

661
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,382
I just don't think
it's your type of thing.

662
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,092
Put the fucking thing on.

663
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,470
You know nothing about me.

664
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,404
All right? Nothing.

665
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,516
See, I like that. Yeah!

666
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,820
<i>10 to 15 inches.</i>

667
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:47,123
See, that's your miniatures.

668
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,292
Anything under that is just a toy.

669
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,055
Good water dogs.

670
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,341
What are you laughing at?

671
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,210
- Come on. Get up here.
- Come on, Andy.

672
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,542
- Go on.
- Get up.

673
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,716
Shake your tail feather, Andy!

674
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,485
That's it. Go on.

675
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,886
There he goes.

676
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,113
Come on.

677
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,449
You, too.

678
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,467
Dyin' for a fag.

679
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,350
Never.
Listen to me.

680
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,085
You will never make it to Thailand.

681
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,253
You won't even get a passport.

682
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,821
Ron's got friends
that can help us.

683
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,323
But things are different now.
There's all sorts of security checks.

684
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,226
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Things have changed, Dale.

685
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:09,165
Ron has murdered two people.
They're gonna catch up with you.

686
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,566
Ron!

687
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,080
Dale, listen to me.

688
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,681
Listen.

689
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,548
You haven't done anything wrong.

690
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,388
Look at you. You're...

691
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,557
You're beautiful.

692
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,526
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

693
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:41,730
You could turn yourself in
tomorrow and walk.

694
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,800
Walk to what, Andy?

695
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,428
Back to stripping?

696
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:51,607
Ron... He loves me
just the way that I am.

697
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,442
But you don't love you...

698
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,377
the way you are.

699
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,213
Boo!

700
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,615
Found this outside, And.

701
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,717
I thought you might have lost it.

702
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,621
Now, you reckon
an art critic did this?

703
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,147
Or have you been up
to something naughty?

704
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,860
She left me.

705
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,828
Crap.

706
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,655
She left me, Ron, all right?

707
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,790
Bullshit!

708
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,037
She walked out
without any of her stuff...

709
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,573
her clothes, her makeup.

710
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,843
Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

711
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,778
you show me a broad
that would do such a thing.

712
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,685
She left me because my father...

713
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:40,178
paid her a great deal
of money to disappear.

714
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,890
And she did.

715
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,791
They met for lunch,
and I never saw her again.

716
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,170
Fuck me dead.

717
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,505
I thought my old man was harsh.

718
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,735
He always said
she was a gold digger.

719
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,076
I guess she was.

720
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,726
Well, this brought the night...

721
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,752
to a rewarding end, didn't it?

722
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,184
They way he keeps all her stuff...

723
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,485
it's fuckin' sicko.

724
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,955
I think it's romantic...

725
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,489
like Miss Havisham.

726
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,719
Miss who?

727
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,926
Forget it.

728
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,665
I shot your boss's
fucking head off, all right?

729
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,901
I fucked up my whole fucking life.

730
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,036
Dale, have you ever
asked yourself once why?

731
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,672
Because you owed him money, Ron!

732
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,374
I fucked him so you'd have
more time to pay.

733
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,509
Yeah, and I killed him
to get you out of that.

734
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,911
You want to get me out of it?

735
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,512
You could've just paid him.

736
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,777
Just paid him, Ron.

737
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,753
Is that right?

738
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,558
You see...

739
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,220
I seen you talking on, Dale.

740
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,128
And you know what?
I don't care.

741
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,832
Because I know you love me.

742
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:36,933
Don't you?

743
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:42,538
Do you love me, Dale?

744
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,815
What do you think?

745
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,620
I got to believe you love me...

746
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,955
because if I don't...

747
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,590
I might as well shoot my head off...

748
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,059
right fucking now.

749
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,719
Do you love me, Dale?

750
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,668
Yes.

751
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,333
Good.

752
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,153
Instead of gawking
at this poor bitch...

753
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,645
why don't you see what's
right in front of your eyes?

754
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,827
- What do you mean?
- What's around her neck?

755
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,091
<i>That must be 50 grand's worth.</i>

756
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,933
I reckon you could get him
to tell you where it is.

757
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,628
You know?

758
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,563
Turn him on a little.

759
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,711
- Make him think you're hot for him.
- Oh, Ron.

760
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,446
What? You did it tonight
and you enjoyed it.

761
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,414
We were just having a bit of fun.

762
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,782
Hey.

763
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,651
I'm not saying fuck him, Dale.

764
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,821
I'm just saying, you know...

765
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:02,257
do what you did
every night at the club.

766
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,695
Are you too good for that now?

767
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:10,097
Isn't that what you wanted?

768
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,303
Yeah.

769
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,738
You're right.

770
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,708
I'll just break his fucking legs...

771
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,443
and he's gonna
cough it up soon enough.

772
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:22,678
You fucking shit.

773
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,841
And that way, you can stay pure!

774
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,879
I'll do it.

775
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,954
That's my girl.

776
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,423
Why are you such an asshole?

777
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:43,398
We're not like him, Dale.

778
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,401
We're different.

779
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:06,185
Ron's going to break your legs if you
don't tell me where her jewelry is.

780
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,525
It's in the bank.

781
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,654
How do I get it?

782
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,335
I will tell you on one condition.

783
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:24,039
You get the money and the jewelry...

784
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,269
and then you call the police
and you disappear.

785
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,412
You must think I'm a bad person.

786
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,185
We've all done bad things
when we're desperate.

787
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,688
I'd be dead already
if it wasn't for you.

788
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,157
- How do I get it?
- Promise.

789
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:43,725
- Ron will get it out of you.
- Promise me

790
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:47,252
you'll take the money,
and you will go.

791
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,527
Then I promise.

792
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,679
It's in the safe deposit box
in the bank...

793
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,482
under Gabrielle's name.

794
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,610
The keys are in my pocket.

795
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,262
They're not here.

796
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,197
No.

797
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:27,530
They're in the music box
in the sunroom.

798
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,768
Fuck this.

799
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,823
Well?

800
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,024
Yep.

801
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,438
Your lipstick should be lighter.

802
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,706
It's fine.

803
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,008
It's not right.

804
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,342
It doesn't matter.

805
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,177
Gabrielle would never wear
that shade with that suit.

806
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:52,010
As if they care at the bank.

807
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,416
I'll change it.

808
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,851
Okay?

809
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:59,583
We might as well get it right.

810
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,729
Thank you, Ronald.

811
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,574
Don't forget who you are, Dale.

812
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,553
Bitch.

813
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,706
You think you could
possibly untie me...

814
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:04,076
so that I could give
Charlie some water?

815
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,837
No!

816
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,397
No, you... you fucker!

817
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,142
You bastard! You ape!

818
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,977
You stupid, dumb ape!

819
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,712
I guess I don't have
to untie you now.

820
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,380
You're never going
to get your money now!

821
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,549
It's just a bird, Andy.

822
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,018
God, I didn't cry that much
when my nana died.

823
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,679
Fuck you.

824
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,389
Sit down.

825
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,084
No.

826
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,863
- Sit down.
- No.

827
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,598
- Sit the fuck down.
- You're gonna kill me anyway.

828
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,932
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Sit down!

829
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,094
Fuck you!

830
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,793
<i>Hi, Mr. Shepard.
It's Frank Middleton.</i>

831
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,957
<i>Your fiancée's here
to cash a check.</i>

832
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,197
<i>Mr. Shepard?</i>

833
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:31,699
All right, Frank.

834
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,210
This will be the last time
that we do this.

835
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,646
<i>Yes, Mr. Shepard.</i>

836
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,414
<i>And your password, please?</i>

837
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,143
Restraint.

838
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,222
Game's over, And...

839
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,690
You don't have to kill me.

840
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,025
I got no choice.

841
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,394
You don't have to do it.

842
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,997
What about if I told you...

843
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,227
that I had done something?

844
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,532
I've done things...

845
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:08,934
things that I can't
tell the police.

846
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,141
So you have been naughty, have you?

847
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,351
It's about my father.

848
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,998
He fucked her.

849
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,166
What?

850
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,501
My father.

851
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:36,638
Your father tumbled your fiancée?

852
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,708
That's why he...

853
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,811
he paid her off.

854
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,080
He wouldn't let us get married.

855
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:48,414
They were having an affair.

856
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,657
That's bad.

857
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,660
I just don't know
if that's bad enough.

858
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,129
I killed him.

859
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,600
I killed my father.

860
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,709
I paid a man

861
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,512
$100,000 in cash.

862
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,776
They made it look like an accident...

863
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,613
on his boat.

864
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,881
He gave me a photograph.

865
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,251
There's proof.

866
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,032
You could take it with you...

867
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:40,068
and you wouldn't have to kill me.

868
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,231
You would always have it over me.

869
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:53,145
I'd like to see this photograph.

870
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,052
Miss Martin to see you.

871
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,289
Miss Martin.

872
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,779
Come in.

873
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,033
Just need you to sign here.

874
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,626
Sure.

875
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,867
We've met before, I think.

876
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:20,775
Have we?

877
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:23,712
Can't think where.

878
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,213
It'll come to me.

879
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,115
Always does.

880
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,584
Come through.

881
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:39,922
Let me know when you're ready.

882
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,958
Turn the light on.

883
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,707
This way.

884
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,224
The photo's behind those pipes,
under that brick.

885
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,726
Go get them.

886
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,354
Can you untie me, please?

887
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,298
You see...

888
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,528
I thought we were becoming friends.

889
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,534
But you fucked me over.

890
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,805
So that'll be a no.

891
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,678
Yeah?

892
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,239
Well, I've been fucked over
my whole life.

893
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,755
Shit!

894
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,314
Andy!

895
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:48,156
Andy! Let me out!

896
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:53,459
Let me out! Andy!

897
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,802
You having fun yet, Andy?

898
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:04,466
I know I am!

899
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,255
Right.

900
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,264
Okay, I forgive you.

901
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:20,745
You have been a bad, bad boy!

902
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,124
Come here!

903
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,174
Oh, Mr. Shepard.

904
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,575
Sergeant Widdens...

905
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,407
what a surprise.

906
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:51,946
You all right, Mr. Shepard?

907
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,982
Yes, sir.

908
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:56,747
I've just been... Sorry.

909
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,053
Been cleaning up out the back.

910
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,154
Can I help you?

911
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:03,491
Well... do you mind
if we come in, sir?

912
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,126
No, actually,
as I said to you yesterday...

913
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,362
I really think it's time
you let us inside, sir.

914
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:10,732
I appreciate that.
I would like to, but...

915
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,901
to be honest,
I can't have people in my home...

916
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,403
because of my condition.

917
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,971
All right.

918
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:19,707
We came by because
two very large checks...

919
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,776
have been drawn against your account
in the last two days.

920
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,544
You aware of that?

921
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:26,581
Yes.

922
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:27,882
$20,000.00.

923
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,647
Made out to cash.

924
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,447
Yes, that's right.

925
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,726
Are you saying you
came by because the...

926
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,262
the bank contacted you?

927
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,830
They routinely monitor these things...

928
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,528
and they couldn't raise you
on the phone.

929
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,570
Shit.

930
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,589
My fiancée, Gabrielle Martin.

931
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,291
Miss Martin.

932
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,960
Sergeant.

933
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,830
Look at the state of you.

934
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:52,300
Been cleaning up in the...

935
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,835
in the basement.

936
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:57,066
Getting ready for the painters.

937
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,440
This place is falling apart.

938
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,142
She's back for one day...

939
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:02,710
and she's running my life already.

940
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,445
I see.

941
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:07,849
Sometimes things work out,
don't they?

942
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,517
The cash withdrawals...

943
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:12,019
it's renovating money.

944
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,856
Just want to make sure
you're all right, sir.

945
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,291
Anyway...

946
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,158
happy renovating.

947
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,831
Me and my old man...

948
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:59,033
we saw this big fucking crash.

949
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:03,004
Big semi just went right
over the top of a little Jap job.

950
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,506
There's a girl stuck in the car.

951
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:08,134
<i>I would've been about 15, I guess.</i>

952
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,078
Car is so dead.
The ambos are on the way.

953
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,647
And my dad, he can't get in there.

954
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,115
So I says, "Hey, Dad.

955
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,650
I can fit, I can get in there".

956
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,819
There's this little gap, right?

957
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,921
I get in.

958
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,324
Fuck me dead, the girl's alive.

959
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:27,591
I can just see her head,
her body's trapped in the car.

960
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,498
<i>She'd be about 25...</i>

961
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:33,000
long, curly blonde hair...

962
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,837
pretty.

963
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,438
She's got blood on her forehead...

964
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,739
but she smiles, you know...

965
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,038
this big beautiful smile.

966
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,480
I said, "Are you okay"?

967
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,949
She's like, "Yeah, I'm fine".

968
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,852
So I keep her talking about
her dog and stuff, you know...

969
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,820
until finally, we hear the sirens...

970
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:56,090
and it's time for me to get out.

971
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,825
And she says to me...

972
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:58,960
she says...

973
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,295
"Well, Ronnie, my name's Sara".

974
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:02,730
"When I get out of here...

975
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:05,859
I'm going to give you
the best night you've ever had".

976
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,903
<i>Which to me, right,
I'm, like, 15...</i>

977
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:11,138
so that's big news.

978
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,941
So I get out feeling
pretty good, right?

979
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:17,178
Then finally, the firies...

980
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,679
they have the jaws of life...

981
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,749
and they open the doors...

982
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,584
and her body's not connected...

983
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,920
to her head.

984
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,455
Decapitated, right?

985
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:31,092
After that, no one
looks me in the eye.

986
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,495
My old man, he just pretends
like it never happened...

987
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,624
like I'm crazy or something.

988
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:43,304
Well, I knew her name
was really Sara.

989
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,636
Isn't that spooky?

990
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,144
Anyway, Andy,
I'm telling you this story...

991
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:53,414
because everything I ever had...

992
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,784
has never been quite real.

993
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,319
It's just disappeared, you know...

994
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,414
like steam off a grate.

995
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,460
Except for Dale.

996
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,724
You see, she's real.

997
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:22,072
I fucking love you.

998
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,912
We're on our way to Thailand, baby!

999
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,585
Tell you what, though,
you had me worried.

1000
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,187
I thought the cops
might have picked you up.

1001
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:36,020
Just took longer than I thought.

1002
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,492
Now, be careful with this, okay?

1003
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:39,760
It's loaded.

1004
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:43,059
You don't want
to lose me at this point.

1005
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,900
So you're just going
to leave him here?

1006
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:51,706
What are you doing, Ron?

1007
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:53,441
Listen, Dale,
it's not a bad way to go.

1008
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,343
And pass me the tape, will you?

1009
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,677
Ron, you promised.

1010
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:59,373
I know, but that was
more of a little white lie.

1011
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,049
You know that he had
his old man bumped?

1012
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,318
He's not just a babe
in the wood, Dale.

1013
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,020
Yeah, Gabrielle was
"writting" his old man...

1014
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,622
so he had him knocked off.

1015
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,557
How sick is that?
Now, the tape, Dale!

1016
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:10,825
No!

1017
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,059
Don't make me stand here.

1018
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,495
Let him go, Ron.

1019
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,700
Dale, we had no choice.

1020
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,403
We have no choice.
We never did.

1021
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,505
I don't want you to kill him.

1022
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,207
You'd better make
a fucking choice right now...

1023
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,242
because there's gonna be
one dead prick in this room.

1024
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,411
- Stop it!
- Him or me, Dale?

1025
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,545
Stop it, Ron!

1026
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,446
- Him or me, Dale?
- Stop it!

1027
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:17,692
Think of this
as Dr. Ron's instant phobia cure.

1028
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,927
Now she's been in there
about five minutes.

1029
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,396
You get out there
and you turn that engine off...

1030
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:26,534
or hell, we'll just pull her
to the house, won't we?

1031
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,102
But if not...

1032
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,337
well, you'll have to live
with that, won't you?

1033
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:33,774
The man who couldn't walk
across his own backyard...

1034
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:36,077
to save his girl.

1035
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,311
Go on, Andy.

1036
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,312
Come on, buddy!

1037
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:40,481
Come on, you pathetic prick!

1038
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,982
Giddyup there, Andy. Go on.

1039
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,178
Come on, Andy. Go on.

1040
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:45,986
That's it!

1041
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,715
Go on! That's it, Andy.

1042
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,981
Go on, that's it.
That's it.

1043
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,695
You're nearly there, Andy.

1044
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,664
Come on, And!

1045
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,466
Get up!

1046
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:01,162
Don't you quit on me,
Andy, come on!

1047
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,429
There we go!

1048
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,141
Oops!

1049
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,234
- Did I lock it?
- Dale! Dale!

1050
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,448
I'd make a bloody good shrink.
Don't you reckon, And?

1051
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,916
Dale!

1052
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,717
- At least you tried.
- Dale!

1053
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:26,220
Hey, hey.

1054
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,530
Fucking love this shit, Andy!

1055
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,243
How long you reckon
she's got, buddy?

1056
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,507
Three minutes or less?

1057
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,209
She's dying, Andy.

1058
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,984
You can run like
a bloody rabbit, Andy.

1059
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:34,161
Dr. Ron was spot on,
don't you reckon?

1060
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:51,537
That's because
we're the same, Andy.

1061
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,217
Except...

1062
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,743
I'm always one step ahead.

1063
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,430
Very good, Andy!
Very good!

1064
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,660
Come on, Andy!

1065
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,431
Is that all you got, Andy?
You can do better...

1066
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,286
Put your back into it, Andy.

1067
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:33,754
Do it.

1068
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,124
We're just the same, Andrew.

1069
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,280
Dale. Dale.

1070
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,455
Dale, come on!

1071
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,155
Here we go.

1072
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:06,974
You gonna ring the cops?

1073
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,310
I have to.

1074
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:13,075
I've got two dead bodies
on my property.

1075
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:16,116
What about me?

1076
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,287
I suppose you'll do some time.

1077
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:22,523
You fucking shit.

1078
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:24,291
It's not as if the police
aren't gonna...

1079
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,293
work out what happened, Dale.

1080
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:28,429
I mean, what are our options?

1081
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,165
I saved your life.

1082
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:33,634
Twice.

1083
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:43,599
Don't you mean three bodies?

1084
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:45,946
Sorry?

1085
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,248
What about your dad?

1086
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:51,752
Isn't he buried out here?

1087
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,555
Daddy's alive and well...

1088
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:57,524
and living in Melbourne.

1089
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:02,129
Wouldn't say we're exactly
on speaking terms, but...

1090
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:05,394
I didn't kill him.

1091
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,240
Say you love me...

1092
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:21,515
like Gabrielle would say it.

1093
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,381
"I love you".

1094
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:27,053
I love you.

1095
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:31,814
I don't believe you.

1096
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,457
I love you, Andrew.

1097
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,000
I love you.

1098
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:50,135
Say you want me, Gabrielle.

1099
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:53,780
I'm Dale, Andy.

1100
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:56,817
Call me Andrew, Gabrielle.

1101
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,119
Say you want me.

1102
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,787
I'm Dale.

1103
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:03,991
Yes, but say it like
Gabrielle would say it.

1104
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,893
Go on, say it.

1105
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:08,662
Yes?

1106
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,893
- I want you.
- Yes.

1107
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:39,425
Do you know where she is?

1108
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,563
No.

1109
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:44,429
Europe, I think.

1110
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,601
What if she comes back?

1111
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,330
She won't.

1112
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:52,072
Doesn't she have family?

1113
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:54,341
No, she lost touch with them.

1114
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,910
Do you know, I think she
even changed her name.

1115
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,912
Don't worry.

1116
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,507
She's gone.
