1
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,407
Charlie?

2
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,177
Charlie, come on.

3
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,094
Not going to the funeral?

4
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,685
No, didn't know her, really.

5
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,354
Is that on credit?

6
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,160
Unfortunately.

7
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,025
Makes you think, though.

8
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,832
Certainly does.
Wonder what he'll say at my funeral.

9
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,500
Something nice, I'm sure.

10
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,707
There you are.

11
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:21,006
Sorry.

12
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,444
Good boy.

13
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:28,542
That's it.

14
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,680
Good boy.

15
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,951
That's it.

16
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,324
Come on.

17
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,987
Here we go.

18
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,199
No! No! Charlie, no!

19
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,928
Oh, no.

20
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,905
Oh, you bloody bugger.

21
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,734
Want some juice?

22
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,206
How much did that cost?

23
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,181
I don't know.
A few bucks.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,151
Yeah? Used every
fucking cent we got, Dale.

25
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,382
Well, I'll put it on my card, Ron.

26
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,082
No.

27
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,160
They can trace after us.

28
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,354
Give me the cash.

29
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,727
Let's do a runner.

30
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,356
They've seen the car, Ron.

31
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,697
Now give me the cash,

32
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,634
and I'll sort it out.

33
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,229
It's only a few bucks.

34
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,572
Listen, you either pay me
the right money,

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,669
or I'll call the cops.

36
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,839
<i>It's $4.50.</i>

37
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,042
Fine.

38
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,415
Look, I hate to put you
in this situation.

39
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,283
Is there anything I could do

40
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,087
that might square things up?

41
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,025
You'd be all right until about nightfall.

42
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,433
Here we go.

43
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,353
Jesus, Ron!

44
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,728
Are you out of your fucking mind?

45
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,266
He was calling the cops!

46
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,932
You gave him a blow job?

47
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,649
What was that back there?

48
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,452
What the fuck were you thinking?

49
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,494
What is Joey doing
in the boot of the car?

50
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,892
What'd you want me to do with him,

51
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,896
leave him in the fucking car park, Dale?

52
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,966
I'm trying to get you
out of that life, Dale,

53
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,329
and the first chance you get,

54
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,528
<i>you're giving a blow
to some servo attendant for 4.50!</i>

55
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,161
It was a fucking handjob, Ron.

56
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,637
Pardon me.
Same difference.

57
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,401
It's a big fucking difference.

58
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,501
One's with the hand,
and one's with the mouth.

59
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,545
Shit. Shit, Ron.

60
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:45,378
- Fucking turn off! Turn off!
- Just sit still and stay calm, all right?

61
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,383
Don't shoot anybody, Ron.

62
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,680
- Don't fucking shoot any...
- Shut up!

63
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,892
All right, we're gonna dump the car.

64
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,922
It's okay, baby.

65
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,294
It's okay.

66
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,433
That's nice.

67
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,445
We should be able to hot-wire it.

68
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,085
Maybe the keys are in the house.

69
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,349
Come on.

70
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,220
Hey, Ron.

71
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,986
What...

72
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,827
what are you doing here?

73
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,368
- No!
- Ron, no!

74
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,165
- Please don't hurt me.
- Shut up!

75
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,863
What's your name, asshole?

76
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,668
- Andrew.
- Andrew?

77
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,764
Asshole.

78
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,503
I was close, wasn't I?

79
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,703
Give me your wallet.

80
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,040
Get it out!

81
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,142
That's it?

82
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,812
Where are your car keys?

83
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,684
In the box on the table over there.

84
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,779
Get them, babe.

85
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,494
Here, hold that.

86
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:45,986
Get on your stomach.

87
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,429
Come on!

88
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,761
- You alone?
- Yes.

89
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:52,904
All right?

90
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,472
Look for some cash
or something.

91
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:55,835
All right.

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,524
Shit.

93
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,569
Oh, my God.

94
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,366
Yeah!

95
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,380
Yes.

96
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,338
Hurry up, Dale!

97
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,466
We're out of here!

98
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,073
Here's the plan, And.

99
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,208
You're going to drive us up North.

100
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:49,378
Dale is going to be in the boot
until we get out of Bowral,

101
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,422
and I'm going to be
right behind you,

102
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,186
with my shotty sticking
straight up your ass.

103
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,227
When we get to Queensland,

104
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,319
you're going to pull
over to an auto teller,

105
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,830
and you're going to withdraw
up to your limit.

106
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,800
Now, I'm doing this
because, you see,

107
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,100
my girlfriend,
she's got a soft heart.

108
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,106
But if it was up to me,

109
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,573
you'd be dead already.

110
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,245
Am I getting through to you, Andy?

111
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,973
I can't.

112
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,051
No, really, you can.

113
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,915
No, you don't understand, I'm...

114
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,080
No, you don't understand.

115
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,418
So?

116
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,322
What do you think?

117
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,555
Women.

118
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,756
We need cash, Dale.

119
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,059
There isn't none.

120
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,930
God, you are fucking killing me.

121
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,774
No, please no!

122
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,276
I can't go outside! Please!

123
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,675
No! Please!

124
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,441
I'm afraid of open spaces.
I can't go outside!

125
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,106
Yeah? Well, I'm afraid

126
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,514
of enclosed spaces, like jail!

127
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,710
Please!

128
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,185
No!

129
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,779
Get out!

130
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,822
Get up!

131
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,589
You are being
a very bad hostage.

132
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,688
Come on!
Get up now.

133
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,959
Fuck!

134
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:08,965
Coppers!

135
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,831
Get back.

136
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,534
Come back inside, Andy.

137
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,605
Come back
in the house, Andy!

138
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,813
Come in the house, Andy!

139
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,408
Come on, Andy.

140
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,850
Pills.

141
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,458
- My pills.
- What the fuck?

142
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,897
Bathroom... bathroom drawer.

143
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,563
Shit.

144
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,282
Servos, jumpers...

145
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,852
We've got it.

146
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,756
- What the fuck is the matter with him?
- He's agoraphobic.

147
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,092
Agora what?

148
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:15,063
I don't know,
he says he can't go outside.

149
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,496
No, no!

150
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,633
No!

151
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,720
Please!

152
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,049
He said he can't go outside.

153
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,123
He's outside now!

154
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,595
Bloody human boomerang.

155
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,540
Shit.

156
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,347
All right...

157
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,474
We just keep our heads down for a bit.

158
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,075
A day or so, they'll call it off

159
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:43,746
and then we can get
the hell out of here.

160
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,049
Ron?

161
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,324
Where's the remote?

162
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,295
Where is it?

163
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,464
Fuck!

164
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,096
Fuck!

165
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,375
They got my face.

166
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,678
If we just done a runner,
when I said so,

167
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,342
we'd be halfway there,

168
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,283
but no, you got to sort it out.

169
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,321
Well, we're fucking sorted now,
aren't we?

170
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,017
Dead guy at the service station,

171
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,059
and our hostage is going
to go the same way.

172
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,355
No, he's not.

173
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,020
You're never killing him.

174
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,358
You're right.

175
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,399
It's about time you did
your own dirty work.

176
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,627
You know how I promised, remember?

177
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,966
I'm not doing that.

178
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,269
Bet you're not, you lazy bitch.

179
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,467
I'm not lazy.

180
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,977
I'm not the only one
that says so, all right?

181
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,547
I am not lazy.

182
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,675
Come on, stop it.

183
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,016
Don't touch me.

184
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,488
Oh, babe, come on.

185
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,456
Go then!

186
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,652
Fucking hell.

187
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,695
I won't forget this, you prick.

188
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,198
Dale!

189
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,609
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,045
I'm not fucking lazy, Ron.

191
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,015
I might be a pig, all right?

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,214
I'm a fucking pig...

193
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,722
that loves you.

194
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,382
I just like you the way you are.

195
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,126
Not dressed up like a champion.

196
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,601
Bitch.

197
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,672
You know?

198
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:48,279
I want to do some nasty,
nasty shit to you.

199
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,391
You're not wearing any undies.

200
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,434
You don't wear undies
in a dress like this.

201
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,416
You're bloody so fucking hot.

202
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,590
Yeah? Do you want me to fuck you?

203
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,666
Yeah.

204
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,018
You got a death wish?

205
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,785
Because I can grant it, dickhead.

206
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,158
No worries at all.

207
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,788
I've thought of a way...

208
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,924
I can get you $40,000.

209
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,571
Say that again.

210
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,006
I can get you $40,000

211
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,304
in two days.

212
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,573
What are you doing?

213
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,581
Our friend Andy
just made a proposition.

214
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,984
This better be good.

215
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,185
It's a trust fund
that my mother set up.

216
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,385
That must be nice.

217
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,760
And this just tops up every fortnight.

218
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,025
Bullshit!

219
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,328
Look, all we have to do
is take the first check

220
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,800
to the bank tomorrow,

221
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:55,304
and they will give you $20,000.

222
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,875
Then when the account
is topped up overnight,

223
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,537
you take the second
check in on the Tuesday.

224
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,478
Look, the local bank
knows about my condition

225
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,982
and they will call here
for a password.

226
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,746
Once I speak to them,
they will pay out in full,

227
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:13,291
and you will have
$40,000 in your hand.

228
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,087
Who does this for you normally?

229
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:16,820
Lilly, my housekeeper.

230
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,365
As if they're going
to give us 20 grand in cash!

231
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:24,128
They will if...

232
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,001
If you become my fiancée.

233
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,370
- I don't look nothing like her.
- Let him finish.

234
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:33,671
When I walked in that first time,

235
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,871
when I saw you standing there...

236
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,947
I'm not doing it.

237
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,039
You were so just like...

238
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,482
Look, Gabrielle's only been
to Bowral a couple of times.

239
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,143
If you were to dye
your hair blonde...

240
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,018
- Where is this fiancée?
- She's overseas.

241
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,021
- She's...
- Ron!

242
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,524
Babe!

243
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,662
Is your fiancée really
as pretty as my Dale here?

244
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,958
That dress is a perfect fit, isn't it?

245
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,298
I'm not doing it, I'll get caught!

246
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,736
Why am I the only one that
has to take a risk, huh?

247
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,070
This is typical of you.

248
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,543
Can't do a bloody thing.

249
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,476
Just take a look at me.

250
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,309
Now look around you.

251
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,883
I could never be her.

252
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,557
Ron, I really don't think

253
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,523
that's the way to talk to her.

254
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,223
Andy, I really don't think

255
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,820
that's the way to talk to Ron.

256
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:29,795
Dale?

257
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:34,468
Hey, you.

258
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,304
I'm scared.

259
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,278
I know you are, babe.

260
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,976
I'm scared, too.

261
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,705
Shit.

262
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,931
<i>Ferrari 360.</i>

263
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,899
<i>He's a fantastic character, too...</i>

264
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,106
Grow up, Andy.

265
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,343
So what's she like, this chick?

266
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,110
Does she talk like you?

267
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,479
I suppose so.

268
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:08,191
You can look at me, Andy.

269
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,624
You never been to a strip club?

270
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,286
No, I haven't.

271
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,365
So how long has she been away?

272
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,195
Six months.

273
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,598
You don't worry she got her legs

274
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,636
wrapped around
some other guy by now?

275
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,002
- No. She's not like that.
- Like what?

276
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,768
Normal?

277
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,245
Like you.

278
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,038
Let me tell you something, Andy.

279
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,846
They're all like me.

280
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,015
<i>Well! What do you know?</i>

281
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,650
<i>Another rainbow!</i>

282
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,504
Where's my gun?

283
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,813
Fuck!

284
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,542
<i>I knew it!
Pot of gold!</i>

285
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,863
If you even wink at these pricks,

286
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,332
- you're fucked!
- What's going on?

287
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,130
Cops are at the door.

288
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,225
Oh, fuck!

289
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,443
Say anything you want.
Just get rid of him.

290
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,772
I've killed two people.

291
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:36,369
I got nothing to lose.

292
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,587
Mr. Shepard?

293
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,886
Yes?

294
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,188
How can I help you?

295
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,025
I'm Sergeant Widdens,
this is Constable Blarney.

296
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,429
We're with the Bowral Police.

297
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,798
Your housekeeper got in touch with us.

298
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:01,064
She reckons she hasn't
been able to raise you.

299
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,140
Oh...

300
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,402
- You all right, Mr. Shepard?
- Yes, I'm fine.

301
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,307
Would you prefer if we came inside?

302
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,549
I've been overdoing it a bit.

303
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:22,149
My fiancée rang a few days ago.

304
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,659
She's met someone else.

305
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,497
She's coming here
to pick up her things.

306
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,693
Yeah, well...

307
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,431
I know how these things
can get on top of you,

308
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,097
but if you could call her,
I'd appreciate it.

309
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,368
I'm really sorry to have troubled you.

310
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,153
You did it.

311
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,655
The cop car hasn't started.

312
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,551
The boss reckons
they're up North by now.

313
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,119
Yeah.

314
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,054
Oh, well.

315
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,259
He's the boss.

316
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,339
<i>Hello?</i>

317
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,041
Yes, hello, Lilly?

318
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,336
It's Andrew.

319
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,071
Yes, I'm sorry,
but thanks for your concern.

320
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,773
No, I was actually really touched.

321
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,747
No, I should have called.

322
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,443
Listen.

323
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,144
I... If you...

324
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:59,018
I don't want you to come in tomorrow
if that's all right.

325
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,649
No, next Tuesday will be fine.

326
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,728
You know, the usual...

327
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,455
personal things, Lilly.

328
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,326
All right, then, well, next week.

329
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,421
Okay.

330
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,194
Thank you.
Bye-bye now. Bye!

331
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,534
You did good.

332
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,702
You know, you could make
a very good crim.

333
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,214
You have earned yourself a shower.

334
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,747
Frittata!

335
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,588
How are you going to live in Thailand
if you can't eat real food?

336
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:39,686
I've had Thai, okay?

337
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,460
This is just an omelet for wankers!

338
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,501
I reckon he's a poofter.

339
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,701
Haven't you noticed?
He likes it when I tie him up.

340
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,840
Take me hostage.

341
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,149
What?

342
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,212
You're so cute
when you're an idiot.

343
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,685
Don't call me cute all right?

344
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:07,947
Kittens are cute.

345
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,573
There's hair dye in the cabinet.

346
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,100
The bathroom is free now
if you need it.

347
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,144
I'm done.

348
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,845
Take out the belly button ring.

349
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,289
What?

350
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,425
You're beautiful.

351
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:25,832
Yeah?

352
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,134
Well, just keep
your hands to yourself.

353
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,319
You are perfect.

354
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,130
A spot-on upper-class bitch.

355
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,860
<i>...has been linked to the abduction...</i>

356
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,026
Shit.

357
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,165
<i>He disappeared from outside his club</i>

358
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,763
<i>in the early hours of Sunday morning.</i>

359
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,708
<i>Police believe he has been wounded</i>

360
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,711
<i>and may be in a serious condition.</i>

361
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,440
<i>In a tragic twist,</i>

362
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,640
<i>service station attendant
Terrance Gilmore</i>

363
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,650
<i>was apparently murdered
yesterday afternoon.</i>

364
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:17,312
<i>Police have released
this photo of a man</i>

365
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,583
<i>wanted for questioning
in relation to both matters.</i>

366
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,922
<i>He is 28-year-old
Ronald Jason Beron.</i>

367
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,723
<i>He is described
as armed and dangerous.</i>

368
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,128
<i>Beron is believed
to be traveling with a woman</i>

369
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:31,497
<i>described as a brunette,
and in her early twenties.</i>

370
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:34,435
<i>Police believe the couple
may still be in the area.</i>

371
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,666
<i>In other news,
Prime Minister John Howard</i>

372
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,639
<i>is meeting with cabinet today.</i>

373
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,508
They think your dickhead boss is alive.

374
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,443
That's why the choppers.

375
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,913
I can't go out there.

376
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:49,749
All right, that didn't look like you,
you're fine.

377
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,219
They're looking for a blue ute

378
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,847
that we are not driving anymore.

379
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,016
Don't make me do it.

380
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,855
Babe, they're looking for a brunette,

381
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,826
and you have blonde hair.

382
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,625
They're looking for a couple.

383
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,029
You're going to be on your own.

384
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,101
It's just shit that they
put out just to rattle us.

385
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,692
That's all.

386
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:08,271
Can't I go tomorrow?

387
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,739
Listen, if you do not go today,

388
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,241
and tomorrow,

389
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,277
we have to stay here
for another two weeks.

390
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,539
I can't go out there.

391
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,118
Well, I can't do it, can I?

392
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,694
You're doing it.

393
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,856
If you don't do this,

394
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,593
you might as well kiss
our future good-bye.

395
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,725
And don't cry.

396
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,079
That's my father
and that's Heather.

397
00:30:57,321 --> 00:31:00,222
<i>- Gold.
- Gold, Andy, gold!</i>

398
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:02,918
<i>You didn't tell anyone?</i>

399
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,495
<i>Not for a couple of years,
and when the list came up,</i>

400
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:06,858
<i>I bought it.</i>

401
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:09,524
<i>I never looked back.</i>

402
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,194
<i>- Your father, the rogue.
- Trust me...</i>

403
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,930
You don't want to see that.

404
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,835
Your dad's an Aussie?

405
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,431
What the bloody hell
happened to you?

406
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,602
Your father's a rogue.

407
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,948
Wasn't that it?

408
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,175
It was perfect.

409
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,911
Gabrielle doesn't smoke, though.

410
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:28,951
Yeah, well, I do.

411
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,213
Hey.

412
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,248
Say something else.

413
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,292
Would you please cash this for me?

414
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,763
Would you...
Open your mouth.

415
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,333
Try and make the words more discreet.

416
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,129
Fuck off!

417
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,137
No one's going to believe I went
to some posh-ass school anyway.

418
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,104
Class is an attitude.
It's not about you.

419
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,039
Why don't you imagine
that everybody you meet

420
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,804
is younger than you are,

421
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,469
like they're 12.

422
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,573
Everyone you meet knows less
about the world than you do.

423
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,142
Would you please cash this for me?

424
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,346
Very good.

425
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,185
Good afternoon,
my name is Gabrielle Martin.

426
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,953
Good afternoon,
my name is Gabrielle Martin.

427
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,528
Perfect.

428
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,995
All right, school's over.

429
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,122
Let's go.

430
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,361
Good afternoon, I'm Miss Martin.

431
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,804
I have this check for you to cash.

432
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,475
Good afternoon,
I'm Gabrielle Martin.

433
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,375
I have this check for you to cash.

434
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,320
If you get stopped,

435
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:43,359
just tell them that you
picked up your old license.

436
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,857
It's just a fine.

437
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,428
Ronald, would you be a darling
and bring the car up for me?

438
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,936
Oh, sure, Miss...

439
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,938
Miss Martin.

440
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,608
Be right with you.

441
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,214
You know I wouldn't let you go

442
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,121
if I didn't think you could do it.

443
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,921
You just want to live, that's all.

444
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,586
Yes.

445
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,288
I do.

446
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,429
That's why I'm not worried about you.

447
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,176
So.

448
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,107
How do I look?

449
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,202
Gum.

450
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,275
Don't, Ronnie.
My lipstick.

451
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,201
Did a good job, Andy.

452
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,134
I hardly recognized her.

453
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,605
Glad you approve.

454
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,978
Oh, I didn't say that, did I?

455
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,314
So you enjoy yourself up there?

456
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,517
Dressing her up?

457
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,287
Doing her hair?

458
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,925
Hey, And, you can admit it.

459
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,125
She's hot. Right?

460
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,360
She's very sweet.

461
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:05,628
Come on, And!

462
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,761
You've been checking her out
ever since we got here.

463
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,169
No, I haven't. I...

464
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,468
You sayin' she's a dog?

465
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:13,372
No, of course I'm not.

466
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:14,944
So you have been checking her out.

467
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,638
No. She's your girl, Ron...

468
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,305
That's right, And!

469
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,850
That's right.
She's my girl.

470
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,015
And you wanna fuck her.

471
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:26,248
No, no. It's not true.

472
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,791
You think she's hot?

473
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,191
- And you'd like to fuck her.
- No, Ron.

474
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,387
You think she's hot,
and you'd like

475
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:33,690
- to fuck her.
- No!

476
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,390
You think she's hot,
and you'd like

477
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:36,693
- to fuck her!
- No, Ron!

478
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,132
You wanna fuck her,
don't ya? Yeah, Andy!

479
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:39,224
Come on!
You wanna fuck her!

480
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,804
Yes! All right! Yes!

481
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,305
I'm only fucking with you, Andy.

482
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:49,439
But maybe I'm not.

483
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,635
Next, please.

484
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,373
Next, please!

485
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:31,220
I've got this check
for you to cash.

486
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,454
I... I've left...

487
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,034
Shit.

488
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,944
It's a lovely piece, that.

489
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,011
Dressed in porcelain in Amalou.

490
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,645
That's 1780.

491
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,623
It's quite unusual. Look.

492
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,318
It's lovely.

493
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,953
Are you after anything
in particular?

494
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,258
No, just browsing.

495
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,357
Of course. Feel free.

496
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,492
Do you live locally?

497
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:23,138
Yes.

498
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,571
We're just out of town.

499
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,666
Well, look, let me get
you one of my cards.

500
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,177
I have contacts here
and overseas,

501
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,373
so often, if you're after
something specific,

502
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,313
I can source it for you.

503
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,783
But next time, you might want
to bring your partner in...

504
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,021
Or not.

505
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,460
I have this check
for you to cash.

506
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,963
Sure.

507
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,647
Now, your chick...

508
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,779
She's hot.

509
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,288
I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

510
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:18,588
- No.
- Good.

511
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,163
Because I'd really
like to fuck her.

512
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,892
I bet you she'd be
a goer, too. Huh?

513
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,400
She like it hard and fast?

514
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:31,532
Am I right?

515
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,078
She like a bit of dirty talk,
you know?

516
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,244
She like it when
you call her a slut?

517
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,649
Just when you're into it?
You know?

518
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,221
Just before she comes?

519
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:49,019
Give her a bit of, "You slut. "

520
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,525
"You bitch. "

521
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,588
She'd love that, wouldn't she?

522
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,665
What's she like
in the rumpy department, And?

523
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,600
She a moaner?

524
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:06,676
Or a screamer?

525
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,404
I bet you she's a screamer.

526
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,709
You're losing her, Ron.

527
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,955
- What?
- She's bored already.

528
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,081
- Haven't you noticed?
- Shut the fuck up.

529
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,421
She's slipping away.

530
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,629
How does that feel?

531
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,004
Knowing that you're...

532
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:38,404
not... quite...

533
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,476
adequate?

534
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,224
Come on!

535
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,990
If the phone rings out,
you're dead.

536
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,325
<i>- Hello?
- Andrew Shepard.</i>

537
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:36,524
Frank, yes.

538
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,864
<i>I need to verify some I.D.</i>

539
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,493
Gabrielle Elizabeth Martin.

540
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,933
Yes, it's my fiancée.

541
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,201
Okay. And password.

542
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:48,971
Restraint.

543
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,273
<i>All right.</i>

544
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:52,873
<i>- Good.
- Yes.</i>

545
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,382
Thank you. Yes.

546
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,645
We're gonna be doing
this again tomorrow.

547
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:56,685
Is that all right?

548
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,845
<i>Yes. That's fine.</i>

549
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,654
Want your license back?

550
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,527
We don't have anything larger.

551
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,623
So that's 10, 12, 14,

552
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,966
16, 18,

553
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,466
19, and 20,000.

554
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:22,937
Thank you.

555
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,858
Miss?

556
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,223
Excuse me. Miss.

557
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,159
This your car?

558
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,236
It belongs to my fiancé.

559
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,270
The door was unlocked.

560
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,807
I wouldn't do that around here.

561
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,442
Sorry.

562
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,689
Here's my money.

563
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,765
I did it. I actually did it, Andy.

564
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,736
It was extraordinary.
They believed everything that I was saying.

565
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,567
You know, they treated me
like I was someone special!

566
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,504
That's what I'm talkin' about, Andy.

567
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,578
You feel alive, huh?
You did good, baby!

568
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:04,146
You did good!

569
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,341
I just felt so comfortable.

570
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,748
Just shows, when one makes
a little bit of effort

571
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,251
with your appearance and whatnot,

572
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,151
and the attitude, darling,

573
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,281
the attitude of those around you
completely changes.

574
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,359
Yeah, well, you can
drop the attitude now.

575
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,189
She's amongst friends now,
isn't she, Andy?

576
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,695
Sorry, darling.
To what attitude do you refer?

577
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,129
The attitude, babe!

578
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,257
The accent, all right?
It's not funny!

579
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:26,861
I knew you could do it.

580
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,938
You could almost be her.

581
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,006
Gold!

582
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,506
We are celebrating tonight, my friends!

583
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,657
You ever order in, Andy?

584
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,391
- I'm sorry?
- You know.

585
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:56,621
Whores.

586
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,758
Hoochie mamas.

587
00:43:58,869 --> 00:43:59,927
You getting me?

588
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,171
What?

589
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,765
Six months without a screw?

590
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,209
No wonder you're tropo, mate!

591
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,146
Come on, And. You gotta learn
to live a little, you know?

592
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,773
I mean, look at that.

593
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:14,908
Now that's a disgrace, man.

594
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:16,747
You've been on that all night.

595
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,723
No wonder.

596
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:28,887
Hang on.

597
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:31,725
I know what you need.

598
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,294
Now where's the ice cream?

599
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:37,236
In the chest freezer, on the side.

600
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,365
By the fridge.

601
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,685
Can I introduce you
to a titillating sensation?

602
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,722
That's a hundred dollars a bottle, Ron.

603
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,233
There's some cheap stuff
in the fridge...

604
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,030
Fuck the cheap stuff.
We're celebrating, mate!

605
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,745
I give you... the champagne spider.

606
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,952
It's like poetry.

607
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,926
Come on. Give your
Master Tom a good swipe.

608
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,088
I really don't think it's my...

609
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:35,858
Oh, and you haven't even tried it!

610
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,566
Come on.

611
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,634
Well, I'll be damned.

612
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,870
Isn't that some gourmet shit?

613
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,071
Drink up, lads!

614
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,752
So what's with all
the paintings, mate?

615
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:01,084
You an art dealer?

616
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:05,620
I used to be.
I'm more of a collector now.

617
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:06,627
Right.

618
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,631
With your private income.

619
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,166
That's right.

620
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:14,603
I was also a dealer.

621
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,166
Dad was a druggie.

622
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:23,909
Your old man's in mining, right?

623
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,044
Among other things.

624
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,145
Little tension between
you and the old man, is there?

625
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,493
How about your mum?

626
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,154
She died a few years ago.

627
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,426
Sorry to hear it.

628
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:48,527
Mine's still around.

629
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:49,935
She breeds dogs.

630
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,304
That's what I'm gonna do, too.

631
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,880
Back.

632
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,145
Now what sort, you reckon?

633
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,278
- I have no idea, Ron.
- Just have a guess.

634
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,788
- I don't know...
- Go on, have a guess!

635
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,755
- I really don't know.
- Have a guess! Play the game!

636
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,354
Play the game.

637
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:15,594
Rottweilers? Pit bulls?

638
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,692
Poodles, mate.

639
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,168
Miniatures.

640
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,239
That's what I'm using
your money for in Thailand.

641
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,807
I'm gonna start my own kennel.

642
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,843
Look anywhere in Asia now.
What do you see?

643
00:47:27,944 --> 00:47:29,969
Gucci. McDonald's.
Coca-fucking-Cola.

644
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,014
You see, they get to a certain level,

645
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,844
and they all want to be white.

646
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,383
Jesus, Ron!

647
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,977
You shut up, babe! Look.

648
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,024
Mercedes Benz.
Little bloody poodles!

649
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,457
Every little yellow bastard
is gonna want one,

650
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,358
either as a pet,

651
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,488
or on the barbie.

652
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,401
What?

653
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,635
I like it, Ron.

654
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,299
I think it's a very good idea.

655
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,309
I knew you'd get it!

656
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,470
- What's this one?
- It's jazz.

657
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,911
New Orleans-style.

658
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,414
- How do you play it?
- You don't.

659
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,313
It's never been played.
It's a first edition.

660
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,319
What's the point of having a record
if not you're gonna play it?

661
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,082
I just don't think
it's your type of thing.

662
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:16,792
Put the fucking thing on.

663
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,566
You know nothing about me.

664
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,104
All right? Nothing.

665
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:41,216
See, I like that. Yeah!

666
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,919
<i>10 to 15 inches.</i>

667
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,216
See, that's your miniatures.

668
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,383
Anything under that is just a toy.

669
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,755
Good water dogs.

670
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,441
What are you laughing at?

671
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,306
- Come on. Get up here.
- Come on, Andy.

672
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:10,242
- Go on.
- Get up.

673
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,809
Shake your tail feather, Andy!

674
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,579
That's it. Go on.

675
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:18,586
There he goes.

676
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:43,813
Come on.

677
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,149
You, too.

678
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,167
Dyin' for a fag.

679
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,440
Never.
Listen to me.

680
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,178
You will never make it to Thailand.

681
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:57,344
You won't even get a passport.

682
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,921
Ron's got friends
that can help us.

683
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,422
But things are different now.
There's all sorts of security checks.

684
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:04,322
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Things have changed, Dale.

685
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:09,262
Ron has murdered two people.
They're gonna catch up with you.

686
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,266
Ron!

687
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,179
Dale, listen to me.

688
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,771
Listen.

689
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,248
You haven't done anything wrong.

690
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,479
Look at you. You're...

691
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,648
You're beautiful.

692
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,625
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

693
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:41,823
You could turn yourself in
tomorrow and walk.

694
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:44,900
Walk to what, Andy?

695
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,128
Back to stripping?

696
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:51,704
Ron... He loves me
just the way that I am.

697
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,537
But you don't love you

698
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,474
the way you are.

699
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:57,307
Boo!

700
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,712
Found this outside, And.

701
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,807
I thought you might have lost it.

702
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:05,718
Now, you reckon
an art critic did this?

703
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,847
Or have you been up
to something naughty?

704
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,958
She left me.

705
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,528
Crap.

706
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,355
She left me, Ron, all right?

707
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,490
Bullshit!

708
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,132
She walked out
without any of her stuff...

709
00:52:22,238 --> 00:52:24,672
her clothes, her makeup.

710
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,937
Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

711
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,478
you show me a broad
that would do such a thing.

712
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,777
She left me because my father...

713
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:39,878
paid her a great deal
of money to disappear.

714
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,590
And she did.

715
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,491
They met for lunch,
and I never saw her again.

716
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,266
Fuck me dead.

717
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,601
I thought my old man was harsh.

718
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,435
He always said
she was a gold digger.

719
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,776
I guess she was.

720
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,819
Well, this brought the night

721
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,452
to a rewarding end, didn't it?

722
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:42,274
They way he keeps all her stuff,

723
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,579
it's fuckin' sicko.

724
00:53:43,686 --> 00:53:46,052
I think it's romantic,

725
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,589
like Miss Havisham.

726
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,419
Miss who?

727
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,626
Forget it.

728
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,755
I shot your boss's
fucking head off, all right?

729
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,993
I fucked up my whole fucking life.

730
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,127
Dale, have you ever
asked yourself once why?

731
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,762
Because you owed him money, Ron!

732
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,465
I fucked him so you'd have
more time to pay.

733
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,600
Yeah, and I killed him
to get you out of that.

734
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,007
You want to get me out of it?

735
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,602
You could've just paid him.

736
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:13,477
Just paid him, Ron.

737
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,453
Is that right?

738
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,648
You see,

739
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,920
I seen you talking on, Dale.

740
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,828
And you know what?
I don't care.

741
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,532
Because I know you love me.

742
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:36,633
Don't you?

743
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,238
Do you love me, Dale?

744
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,515
What do you think?

745
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,713
I got to believe you love me

746
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,049
because if I don't,

747
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,680
I might as well shoot my head off

748
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,759
right fucking now.

749
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,419
Do you love me, Dale?

750
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,368
Yes.

751
00:55:10,406 --> 00:55:12,033
Good.

752
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,243
Instead of gawking
at this poor bitch,

753
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,345
why don't you see what's
right in front of your eyes?

754
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,927
- What do you mean?
- What's around her neck?

755
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,791
<i>That must be 50 grand's worth.</i>

756
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,030
I reckon you could get him
to tell you where it is.

757
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,328
You know?

758
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,263
Turn him on a little.

759
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,807
- Make him think you're hot for him.
- Oh, Ron.

760
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,539
What? You did it tonight
and you enjoyed it.

761
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,512
We were just having a bit of fun.

762
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:53,877
Hey.

763
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,746
I'm not saying fuck him, Dale.

764
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,912
I'm just saying, you know,

765
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,957
do what you did
every night at the club.

766
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,791
Are you too good for that now?

767
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,797
Isn't that what you wanted?

768
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,394
Yeah.

769
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,438
You're right.

770
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:19,805
I'll just break his fucking legs

771
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,536
and he's gonna
cough it up soon enough.

772
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,770
You fucking shit.

773
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,541
And that way, you can stay pure!

774
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,579
I'll do it.

775
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,654
That's my girl.

776
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,123
Why are you such an asshole?

777
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:43,098
We're not like him, Dale.

778
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:46,101
We're different.

779
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,885
Ron's going to break your legs
if you don't tell me where her jewelry is.

780
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,618
It's in the bank.

781
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,354
How do I get it?

782
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,432
I will tell you on one condition.

783
00:57:20,536 --> 00:57:24,131
You get the money and the jewelry,

784
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,969
and then you call the police
and you disappear.

785
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,112
You must think I'm a bad person.

786
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,276
We've all done bad things
when we're desperate.

787
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,787
I'd be dead already
if it wasn't for you.

788
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,255
- How do I get it?
- Promise.

789
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,825
- Ron will get it out of you.
- Promise me

790
00:57:43,926 --> 00:57:46,952
you'll take the money,
and you will go.

791
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,227
Then I promise.

792
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:03,775
It's in the safe deposit box
in the bank,

793
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,576
under Gabrielle's name.

794
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,310
The keys are in my pocket.

795
00:58:18,227 --> 00:58:20,354
They're not here.

796
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,897
No.

797
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:27,230
They're in the music box
in the sunroom.

798
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:00,468
Fuck this.

799
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,523
Well?

800
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:36,724
Yep.

801
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:43,537
Your lipstick should be lighter.

802
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:44,799
It's fine.

803
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,101
It's not right.

804
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,437
It doesn't matter.

805
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,272
Gabrielle would never wear
that shade with that suit.

806
01:00:49,378 --> 01:00:51,710
As if they care at the bank.

807
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,507
I'll change it.

808
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,948
Okay?

809
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,283
We might as well get it right.

810
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:14,429
Thank you, Ronald.

811
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:22,274
Don't forget who you are, Dale.

812
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,253
Bitch.

813
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,406
You think you could
possibly untie me,

814
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:03,776
so that I could give
Charlie some water?

815
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:21,936
No!

816
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,097
No, you... you fucker!

817
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:27,232
You bastard! You ape!

818
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,072
You stupid, dumb ape!

819
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,805
I guess I don't have
to untie you now.

820
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,471
You're never going
to get your money now!

821
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:34,640
It's just a bird, Andy.

822
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,116
God, I didn't cry that much
when my nana died.

823
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:38,379
Fuck you.

824
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,489
Sit down.

825
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:42,784
No.

826
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,959
- Sit down.
- No.

827
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,691
- Sit the fuck down.
- You're gonna kill me anyway.

828
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,027
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Sit down!

829
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:52,794
Fuck you!

830
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,882
<i>Hi, Mr. Shepard.
It's Frank Middleton.</i>

831
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:21,657
<i>Your fiancée's here
to cash a check.</i>

832
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:24,897
<i>Mr. Shepard?</i>

833
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,399
All right, Frank.

834
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,303
This will be the last time
that we do this.

835
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,743
<i>Yes, Mr. Shepard.</i>

836
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,508
<i>And your password, please?</i>

837
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:40,843
Restraint.

838
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,317
Game's over, And.

839
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,788
You don't have to kill me.

840
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,119
I got no choice.

841
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,490
You don't have to do it.

842
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:56,087
What about if I told you

843
01:03:56,198 --> 01:03:57,927
that I had done something?

844
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:04,232
I've done things,

845
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,634
things that I can't
tell the police.

846
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,841
So you have been naughty, have you?

847
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,051
It's about my father.

848
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,098
He fucked her.

849
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,257
What?

850
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,597
My father.

851
01:04:33,702 --> 01:04:36,728
Your father tumbled your fiancée?

852
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,808
That's why he...

853
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,901
he paid her off.

854
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,173
He wouldn't let us get married.

855
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:48,114
They were having an affair.

856
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,752
That's bad.

857
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,759
I just don't know
if that's bad enough.

858
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,829
I killed him.

859
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,300
I killed my father.

860
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,808
I paid a man

861
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:17,606
$100,000 in cash.

862
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,476
They made it look like an accident...

863
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,313
on his boat.

864
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,581
He gave me a photograph.

865
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,951
There's proof.

866
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:37,131
You could take it with you,

867
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,168
and you wouldn't have to kill me.

868
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,931
You would always have it over me.

869
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,845
I'd like to see this photograph.

870
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,752
Miss Martin to see you.

871
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,387
Miss Martin.

872
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,479
Come in.

873
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,123
Just need you to sign here.

874
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,326
Sure.

875
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:17,567
We've met before, I think.

876
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,870
Have we?

877
01:06:20,976 --> 01:06:23,809
Can't think where.

878
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,312
It'll come to me.

879
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,211
Always does.

880
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,284
Come through.

881
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:39,622
Let me know when you're ready.

882
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,658
Turn the light on.

883
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,407
This way.

884
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,314
The photo's behind those pipes,
under that brick.

885
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,825
Go get them.

886
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,054
Can you untie me, please?

887
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,390
You see,

888
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,228
I thought we were becoming friends.

889
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,234
But you fucked me over.

890
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,505
So that'll be a no.

891
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,772
Yeah?

892
01:07:30,879 --> 01:07:33,939
Well, I've been fucked over
my whole life.

893
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,854
Shit!

894
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,014
Andy!

895
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,856
Andy! Let me out!

896
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:53,159
Let me out! Andy!

897
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,896
You having fun yet, Andy?

898
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:04,166
I know I am!

899
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:27,955
Right.

900
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:30,964
Okay, I forgive you.

901
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:20,445
You have been a bad, bad boy!

902
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:31,824
Come here!

903
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,269
Oh, Mr. Shepard.

904
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,672
Sergeant Widdens,

905
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,107
what a surprise.

906
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,041
You all right, Mr. Shepard?

907
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,081
Yes, sir.

908
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,447
I've just been... Sorry.

909
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,144
Been cleaning up out the back.

910
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:00,243
Can I help you?

911
01:11:00,355 --> 01:11:03,586
Well... do you mind
if we come in, sir?

912
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,216
No, actually,
as I said to you yesterday...

913
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,454
I really think it's time
you let us inside, sir.

914
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,828
I appreciate that.
I would like to, but...

915
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,993
to be honest,
I can't have people in my home

916
01:11:14,102 --> 01:11:15,501
because of my condition.

917
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,071
All right.

918
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,800
We came by because
two very large checks

919
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,876
have been drawn against your account
in the last two days.

920
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,638
You aware of that?

921
01:11:23,745 --> 01:11:26,680
Yes.

922
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:27,976
$20,000.

923
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,347
Made out to cash.

924
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,147
Yes, that's right.

925
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,824
Are you saying you
came by because the...

926
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:41,361
the bank contacted you?

927
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,930
They routinely monitor these things,

928
01:11:43,031 --> 01:11:46,228
and they couldn't raise you
on the phone.

929
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,270
Shit.

930
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,682
My fiancée, Gabrielle Martin.

931
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,382
Miss Martin.

932
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,052
Sergeant.

933
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,925
Look at the state of you.

934
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,398
Been cleaning up in the...

935
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:53,934
in the basement.

936
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,766
Getting ready for the painters.

937
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,532
This place is falling apart.

938
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,233
She's back for one day

939
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,810
and she's running my life already.

940
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:04,538
I see.

941
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,945
Sometimes things work out,
don't they?

942
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,608
The cash withdrawals,

943
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,118
it's renovating money.

944
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,950
Just want to make sure
you're all right, sir.

945
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,389
Anyway,

946
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:19,858
happy renovating.

947
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,927
Me and my old man,

948
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,125
we saw this big fucking crash.

949
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:03,102
Big semi just went right
over the top of a little Jap job.

950
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,605
There's a girl stuck in the car.

951
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,834
<i>I would've been about 15, I guess.</i>

952
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,175
Car is so dead.
The ambos are on the way.

953
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:12,746
And my dad, he can't get in there.

954
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,213
So I says, "Hey, Dad.

955
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,749
I can fit, I can get in there. "

956
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,910
There's this little gap, right?

957
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,011
I get in.

958
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,421
Fuck me dead, the girl's alive.

959
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:27,291
I can just see her head,
her body's trapped in the car.

960
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,592
<i>She'd be about 25,</i>

961
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,099
long, curly blonde hair,

962
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:35,931
pretty.

963
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:37,528
She's got blood on her forehead,

964
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:38,833
but she smiles, you know,

965
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,738
this big beautiful smile.

966
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,579
I said, "Are you okay?"

967
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:48,047
She's like, "Yeah, I'm fine. "

968
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,948
So I keep her talking about
her dog and stuff, you know,

969
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,918
until finally, we hear the sirens

970
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:56,184
and it's time for me to get out.

971
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,918
And she says to me,

972
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,050
she says,

973
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,391
"Well, Ronnie, my name's Sara.

974
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:02,827
"When I get out of here,

975
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,559
I'm going to give you
the best night you've ever had. "

976
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,994
<i>Which to me, right, I'm, like, 15,</i>

977
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,231
so that's big news.

978
01:15:11,339 --> 01:15:14,035
So I get out feeling
pretty good, right?

979
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:17,270
Then finally, the firies,

980
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:18,778
they have the jaws of life,

981
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,849
and they open the doors,

982
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,679
and her body's not connected

983
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:26,015
to her head.

984
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,554
Decapitated, right?

985
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,183
After that, no one looks me in the eye.

986
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,592
My old man,
he just pretends like it never happened,

987
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,324
like I'm crazy or something.

988
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,399
Well, I knew her name
was really Sara.

989
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,336
Isn't that spooky?

990
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:50,242
Anyway, Andy,
I'm telling you this story

991
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:53,508
because everything I ever had

992
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:56,880
has never been quite real.

993
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,418
It's just disappeared, you know,

994
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,114
like steam off a grate.

995
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:06,559
Except for Dale.

996
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:08,424
You see, she's real.

997
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,772
I fucking love you.

998
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,612
We're on our way to Thailand, baby!

999
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:30,682
Tell you what, though,
you had me worried.

1000
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:33,277
I thought the cops
might have picked you up.

1001
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,720
Just took longer than I thought.

1002
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:38,590
Now, be careful with this, okay?

1003
01:16:38,693 --> 01:16:39,853
It's loaded.

1004
01:16:39,961 --> 01:16:42,759
You don't want
to lose me at this point.

1005
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,600
So you're just going
to leave him here?

1006
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:51,806
What are you doing, Ron?

1007
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,534
Listen, Dale, it's not a bad way to go.

1008
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,439
And pass me the tape, will you?

1009
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:56,772
Ron, you promised.

1010
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:59,073
I know, but that was
more of a little white lie.

1011
01:17:00,348 --> 01:17:02,145
You know that he had
his old man bumped?

1012
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,411
He's not just a babe
in the wood, Dale.

1013
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:06,111
Yeah, Gabrielle was
"writting" his old man,

1014
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,711
so he had him knocked off.

1015
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:09,654
How sick is that?
Now, the tape, Dale!

1016
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:10,918
No!

1017
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,152
Don't make me stand here.

1018
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,195
Let him go, Ron.

1019
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,792
Dale, we had no choice.

1020
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,495
We have no choice.
We never did.

1021
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,595
I don't want you to kill him.

1022
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:26,298
You'd better make
a fucking choice right now

1023
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,342
because there's gonna be
one dead prick in this room.

1024
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,502
- Stop it!
- Him or me, Dale?

1025
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:31,636
Stop it, Ron!

1026
01:17:31,746 --> 01:17:34,146
- Him or me, Dale?
- Stop it!

1027
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:17,786
Think of this
as Dr. Ron's instant phobia cure.

1028
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:20,020
Now she's been in there
about five minutes.

1029
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:22,494
You get out there
and you turn that engine off,

1030
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:26,624
or hell, we'll just pull her
to the house, won't we?

1031
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,202
But if not,

1032
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,430
well, you'll have to live
with that, won't you?

1033
01:18:30,538 --> 01:18:33,871
The man who couldn't walk
across his own backyard

1034
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,170
to save his girl.

1035
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,404
Go on, Andy.

1036
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:38,410
Come on, buddy!

1037
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:40,572
Come on, you pathetic prick!

1038
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,081
Giddyup there, Andy. Go on.

1039
01:18:42,183 --> 01:18:43,878
Come on, Andy. Go on.

1040
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,077
That's it!

1041
01:18:46,187 --> 01:18:47,415
Go on! That's it, Andy.

1042
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:51,681
Go on, that's it.
That's it.

1043
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:54,786
You're nearly there, Andy.

1044
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,761
Come on, And!

1045
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,560
Get up!

1046
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,862
Don't you quit on me,
Andy, come on!

1047
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,129
There we go!

1048
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:07,236
Oops!

1049
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,934
- Did I lock it?
- Dale! Dale!

1050
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,541
I'd make a bloody good shrink.
Don't you reckon, And?

1051
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:15,616
Dale!

1052
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,417
- At least you tried.
- Dale!

1053
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,920
Hey, hey.

1054
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,230
Fucking love this shit, Andy!

1055
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:16,339
How long you reckon
she's got, buddy?

1056
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,207
Three minutes or less?

1057
01:20:19,647 --> 01:20:20,909
She's dying, Andy.

1058
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:25,684
You can run like
a bloody rabbit, Andy.

1059
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:33,861
Dr. Ron was spot on,
don't you reckon?

1060
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,237
That's because
we're the same, Andy.

1061
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,309
Except...

1062
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,443
I'm always one step ahead.

1063
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:09,524
Very good, Andy!
Very good!

1064
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,360
Come on, Andy!

1065
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,131
Is that all you got, Andy?
You can do better...

1066
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:32,379
Put your back into it, Andy.

1067
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,454
Do it.

1068
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,824
We're just the same, Andrew.

1069
01:21:58,513 --> 01:21:59,980
Dale. Dale.

1070
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,155
Dale, come on!

1071
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,855
Here we go.

1072
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,674
You gonna ring the cops?

1073
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,403
I have to.

1074
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:12,775
I've got two dead bodies
on my property.

1075
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,816
What about me?

1076
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:20,382
I suppose you'll do some time.

1077
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,615
You fucking shit.

1078
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,385
It's not as if the police aren't gonna

1079
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,392
work out what happened, Dale.

1080
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:28,519
I mean, what are our options?

1081
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,258
I saved your life.

1082
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,334
Twice.

1083
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:43,299
Don't you mean three bodies?

1084
01:24:44,812 --> 01:24:46,040
Sorry?

1085
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,342
What about your dad?

1086
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:51,850
Isn't he buried out here?

1087
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:54,649
Daddy's alive and well

1088
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,623
and living in Melbourne.

1089
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:02,219
Wouldn't say we're exactly
on speaking terms, but...

1090
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:05,094
I didn't kill him.

1091
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:13,940
Say you love me...

1092
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,608
like Gabrielle would say it.

1093
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:23,081
"I love you. "

1094
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,753
I love you.

1095
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:31,514
I don't believe you.

1096
01:25:34,495 --> 01:25:37,157
I love you, Andrew.

1097
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:39,700
I love you.

1098
01:25:47,241 --> 01:25:49,835
Say you want me, Gabrielle.

1099
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:53,873
I'm Dale, Andy.

1100
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:56,916
Call me Andrew, Gabrielle.

1101
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:59,213
Say you want me.

1102
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,878
I'm Dale.

1103
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:04,082
Yes, but say it like
Gabrielle would say it.

1104
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:05,989
Go on, say it.

1105
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:08,756
Yes?

1106
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:11,593
- I want you.
- Yes.

1107
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:39,125
Do you know where she is?

1108
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,659
No.

1109
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:44,129
Europe, I think.

1110
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,698
What if she comes back?

1111
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:49,030
She won't.

1112
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,171
Doesn't she have family?

1113
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,434
No, she lost touch with them.

1114
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:57,010
Do you know, I think she
even changed her name.

1115
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:59,011
Don't worry.

1116
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:01,207
She's
gone.
