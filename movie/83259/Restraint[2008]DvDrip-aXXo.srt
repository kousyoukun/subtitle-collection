1
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,207
Charlie?

2
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,977
Charlie, come on.

3
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,894
Not going to the funeral?

4
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,485
No, didn't know her, really.

5
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,154
Is that on credit?

6
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,960
Unfortunately.

7
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,825
Makes you think, though.

8
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,632
Certainly does.
Wonder what he'll say at my funeral.

9
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,300
Something nice, I'm sure.

10
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,507
There you are.

11
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,806
Sorry.

12
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,244
Good boy.

13
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,342
That's it.

14
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,480
Good boy.

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,751
That's it.

16
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,124
Come on.

17
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,787
Here we go.

18
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,999
No! No! Charlie, no!

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,728
Oh, no.

20
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,705
Oh, you bloody bugger.

21
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,534
Want some juice?

22
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,006
How much did that cost?

23
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,981
I don't know.
A few bucks.

24
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,951
Yeah? Used every
fucking cent we got, Dale.

25
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,182
Well, I'll put it on my card, Ron.

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,882
No.

27
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,960
They can trace after us.

28
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,154
Give me the cash.

29
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,527
Let's do a runner.

30
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,156
They've seen the car, Ron.

31
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,497
Now give me the cash,

32
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,434
and I'll sort it out.

33
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,029
It's only a few bucks.

34
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,372
Listen, you either pay me
the right money,

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,469
or I'll call the cops.

36
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,639
It's <i>$4.50.</i>

37
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,842
Fine.

38
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,215
Look, I hate to put you
in this situation.

39
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,083
Is there anything I could do

40
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,887
that might square things up?

41
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,825
You'd be all right until about nightfall.

42
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,233
Here we go.

43
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,153
Jesus, Ron!

44
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,528
Are you out of your fucking mind?

45
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,066
He was calling the cops!

46
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,732
You gave him a blow job?

47
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,449
What was that back there?

48
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,252
What the fuck were you thinking?

49
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,294
What is Joey doing
in the boot of the car?

50
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,692
What'd you want me to do with him,

51
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,696
leave him in the fucking car park, Dale?

52
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,766
I'm trying to get you
out of that life, Dale,

53
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,129
and the first chance you get,

54
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,328
you're giving a blow
to some servo attendant for <i>4.50!</i>

55
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,961
It was a fucking handjob, Ron.

56
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,437
Pardon me.
Same difference.

57
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,201
It's a big fucking difference.

58
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,301
One's with the hand,
and one's with the mouth.

59
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,345
Shit. Shit, Ron.

60
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,178
- Fucking turn off! Turn off!
- Just sit still and stay calm, all right?

61
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,183
Don't shoot anybody, Ron.

62
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,480
- Don't fucking shoot any...
- Shut up!

63
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,692
All right, we're gonna dump the car.

64
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,722
It's okay, baby.

65
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,094
It's okay.

66
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,233
That's nice.

67
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,245
We should be able to hot-wire it.

68
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,885
Maybe the keys are in the house.

69
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,149
Come on.

70
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,020
Hey, Ron.

71
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,786
What...

72
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,627
what are you doing here?

73
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,168
- No!
- Ron, no!

74
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,965
- Please don't hurt me.
- Shut up!

75
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,663
What's your name, asshole?

76
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,468
- Andrew.
- Andrew?

77
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,564
Asshole.

78
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,303
I was close, wasn't I?

79
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,503
Give me your wallet.

80
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,840
Get it out!

81
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,942
That's it?

82
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,612
Where are your car keys?

83
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,484
In the box on the table over there.

84
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,579
Get them, babe.

85
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,294
Here, hold that.

86
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,786
Get on your stomach.

87
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,229
Come on!

88
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,561
- You alone?
- Yes.

89
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,704
All right?

90
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,272
Look for some cash
or something.

91
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,635
All right.

92
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,324
Shit.

93
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,369
Oh, my God.

94
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,166
Yeah!

95
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,180
Yes.

96
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,138
Hurry up, Dale!

97
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,266
We're out of here!

98
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,873
Here's the plan, And.

99
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,008
You're going to drive us up North.

100
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,178
Dale is going to be in the boot
until we get out of Bowral,

101
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,222
and I'm going to be
right behind you,

102
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,986
with my shotty sticking
straight up your ass.

103
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,027
When we get to Queensland,

104
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,119
you're going to pull
over to an auto teller,

105
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,630
and you're going to withdraw
up to your limit.

106
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,600
Now, I'm doing this
because, you see,

107
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,900
my girlfriend,
she's got a soft heart.

108
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,906
But if it was up to me,

109
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,373
you'd be dead already.

110
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,045
Am I getting through to you, Andy?

111
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,773
I can't.

112
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,851
No, really, you can.

113
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,715
No, you don't understand, I'm...

114
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,880
No, you don't understand.

115
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,218
So?

116
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,122
What do you think?

117
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,355
Women.

118
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,556
We need cash, Dale.

119
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,859
There isn't none.

120
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,730
God, you are fucking killing me.

121
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,574
No, please no!

122
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,076
I can't go outside! Please!

123
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,475
No! Please!

124
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,241
I'm afraid of open spaces.
I can't go outside!

125
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,906
Yeah? Well, I'm afraid

126
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,314
of enclosed spaces, like jail!

127
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,510
Please!

128
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,985
No!

129
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,579
Get out!

130
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,622
Get up!

131
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,389
You are being
a very bad hostage.

132
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,488
Come on!
Get up now.

133
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,759
Fuck!

134
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,765
Coppers!

135
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,631
Get back.

136
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,334
Come back inside, Andy.

137
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,405
Come back
in the house, Andy!

138
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,613
Come in the house, Andy!

139
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,208
Come on, Andy.

140
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,650
Pills.

141
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,258
- My pills.
- What the fuck?

142
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,697
Bathroom... bathroom drawer.

143
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,363
Shit.

144
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,082
Servos, jumpers...

145
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,652
We've got it.

146
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,556
- What the fuck is the matter with him?
- He's agoraphobic.

147
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,892
Agora what?

148
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,863
I don't know,
he says he can't go outside.

149
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,296
No, no!

150
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,433
No!

151
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,520
Please!

152
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,849
He said he can't go outside.

153
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:37,923
He's outside now!

154
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,395
Bloody human boomerang.

155
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,340
Shit.

156
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,147
All right...

157
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,274
We just keep our heads down for a bit.

158
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,875
A day or so, they'll call it off

159
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,546
and then we can get
the hell out of here.

160
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,849
Ron?

161
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,124
Where's the remote?

162
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,095
Where is it?

163
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,264
Fuck!

164
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,896
Fuck!

165
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,175
They got my face.

166
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,478
If we just done a runner,
when I said so,

167
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,142
we'd be halfway there,

168
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,083
but no, you got to sort it out.

169
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,121
Well, we're fucking sorted now,
aren't we?

170
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,817
Dead guy at the service station,

171
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,859
and our hostage is going
to go the same way.

172
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,155
No, he's not.

173
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,820
You're never killing him.

174
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,158
You're right.

175
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,199
It's about time you did
your own dirty work.

176
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,427
You know how I promised, remember?

177
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,766
I'm not doing that.

178
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,069
Bet you're not, you lazy bitch.

179
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,267
I'm not lazy.

180
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,777
I'm not the only one
that says so, all right?

181
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,347
I am not lazy.

182
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,475
Come on, stop it.

183
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,816
Don't touch me.

184
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,288
Oh, babe, come on.

185
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,256
Go then!

186
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,452
Fucking hell.

187
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,495
I won't forget this, you prick.

188
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,998
Dale!

189
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,409
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,845
I'm not fucking lazy, Ron.

191
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,815
I might be a pig, all right?

192
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,014
I'm a fucking pig...

193
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,522
that loves you.

194
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,182
I just like you the way you are.

195
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,926
Not dressed up like a champion.

196
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,401
Bitch.

197
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,472
You know?

198
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:48,079
I want to do some nasty,
nasty shit to you.

199
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,191
You're not wearing any undies.

200
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,234
You don't wear undies
in a dress like this.

201
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,216
You're bloody so fucking hot.

202
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,390
Yeah? Do you want me to fuck you?

203
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,466
Yeah.

204
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,818
You got a death wish?

205
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,585
Because I can grant it, dickhead.

206
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,958
No worries at all.

207
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,588
I've thought of a way...

208
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,724
I can get you $40,000.

209
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,371
Say that again.

210
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,806
I can get you $40,000

211
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,104
in two days.

212
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,373
What are you doing?

213
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,381
Our friend Andy
just made a proposition.

214
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,784
This better be good.

215
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,985
It's a trust fund
that my mother set up.

216
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,185
That must be nice.

217
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,560
And this just tops up every fortnight.

218
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,825
Bullshit!

219
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,128
Look, all we have to do
is take the first check

220
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,600
to the bank tomorrow,

221
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,104
and they will give you $20,000.

222
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,675
Then when the account
is topped up overnight,

223
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,337
you take the second
check in on the Tuesday.

224
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,278
Look, the local bank
knows about my condition

225
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,782
and they will call here
for a password.

226
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,546
Once I speak to them,
they will pay out in full,

227
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:13,091
and you will have
$40,000 in your hand.

228
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,887
Who does this for you normally?

229
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,620
Lilly, my housekeeper.

230
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:21,165
As if they're going
to give us 20 grand in cash!

231
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,928
They will if...

232
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,801
If you become my fiancée.

233
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,170
- I don't look nothing like her.
- Let him finish.

234
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,471
When I walked in that first time,

235
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,671
when I saw you standing there...

236
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,747
I'm not doing it.

237
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,839
You were so just like...

238
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,282
Look, Gabrielle's only been
to Bowral a couple of times.

239
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,943
If you were to dye
your hair blonde...

240
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,818
- Where is this fiancée?
- She's overseas.

241
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:45,821
- She's...
- Ron!

242
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,324
Babe!

243
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,462
Is your fiancée really
as pretty as my Dale here?

244
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,758
That dress is a perfect fit, isn't it?

245
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,098
I'm not doing it, I'll get caught!

246
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,536
Why am I the only one that
has to take a risk, huh?

247
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,870
This is typical of you.

248
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,343
Can't do a bloody thing.

249
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,276
Just take a look at me.

250
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,109
Now look around you.

251
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,683
I could never be her.

252
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,357
Ron, I really don't think

253
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,323
that's the way to talk to her.

254
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,023
Andy, I really don't think

255
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,620
that's the way to talk to Ron.

256
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,595
Dale?

257
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,268
Hey, you.

258
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,104
I'm scared.

259
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,078
I know you are, babe.

260
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,776
I'm scared, too.

261
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,505
Shit.

262
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,731
<i>Ferrari 360.</i>

263
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,699
<i>He's a fantastic character, too...</i>

264
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,906
Grow up, Andy.

265
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,143
So what's she like, this chick?

266
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,910
Does she talk like you?

267
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,279
I suppose so.

268
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,991
You can look at me, Andy.

269
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,424
You never been to a strip club?

270
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,086
No, I haven't.

271
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,165
So how long has she been away?

272
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,995
Six months.

273
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,398
You don't worry she got her legs

274
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,436
wrapped around
some other guy by now?

275
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,802
- No. She's not like that.
- Like what?

276
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,568
Normal?

277
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,045
Like you.

278
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,838
Let me tell you something, Andy.

279
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,646
They're all like me.

280
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,815
<i>Well! What do you know?</i>

281
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,450
<i>Another rainbow!</i>

282
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,304
Where's my gun?

283
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,613
Fuck!

284
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,342
<i>I knew it!</i>
<i>Pot of gold!</i>

285
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,663
If you even wink at these pricks,

286
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,132
- you're fucked!
- What's going on?

287
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,930
Cops are at the door.

288
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,025
Oh, fuck!

289
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,243
Say anything you want.
Just get rid of him.

290
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,572
I've killed two people.

291
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,169
I got nothing to lose.

292
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,387
Mr. Shepard?

293
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,686
Yes?

294
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:49,988
How can I help you?

295
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,825
I'm Sergeant Widdens,
this is Constable Blarney.

296
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,229
We're with the Bowral Police.

297
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,598
Your housekeeper got in touch with us.

298
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,864
She reckons she hasn't
been able to raise you.

299
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,940
Oh...

300
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,202
- You all right, Mr. Shepard?
- Yes, I'm fine.

301
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,107
Would you prefer if we came inside?

302
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,349
I've been overdoing it a bit.

303
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,949
My fiancée rang a few days ago.

304
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,459
She's met someone else.

305
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,297
She's coming here
to pick up her things.

306
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,493
Yeah, well...

307
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,231
I know how these things
can get on top of you,

308
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,897
but if you could call her,
I'd appreciate it.

309
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,168
I'm really sorry to have troubled you.

310
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,953
You did it.

311
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,455
The cop car hasn't started.

312
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,351
The boss reckons
they're up North by now.

313
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,919
Yeah.

314
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,854
Oh, well.

315
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,059
He's the boss.

316
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,139
<i>Hello?</i>

317
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,841
Yes, hello, Lilly?

318
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,136
It's Andrew.

319
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,871
Yes, I'm sorry,
but thanks for your concern.

320
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,573
No, I was actually really touched.

321
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,547
No, I should have called.

322
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,243
Listen.

323
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,944
l... If you...

324
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,818
I don't want you to come in tomorrow
if that's all right.

325
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,449
No, next Tuesday will be fine.

326
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,528
You know, the usual...

327
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,255
personal things, Lilly.

328
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,126
All right, then, well, next week.

329
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,221
Okay.

330
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,994
Thank you.
Bye-bye now. Bye!

331
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,334
You did good.

332
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,502
You know, you could make
a very good crim.

333
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,014
You have earned yourself a shower.

334
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,547
Frittata!

335
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,388
How are you going to live in Thailand
if you can't eat real food?

336
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,486
I've had Thai, okay?

337
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,260
This is just an omelet for wankers!

338
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,301
I reckon he's a poofter.

339
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,501
Haven't you noticed?
He likes it when I tie him up.

340
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,640
Take me hostage.

341
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:57,949
What?

342
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,012
You're so cute
when you're an idiot.

343
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,485
Don't call me cute all right?

344
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,747
Kittens are cute.

345
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,373
There's hair dye in the cabinet.

346
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,900
The bathroom is free now
if you need it.

347
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,944
I'm done.

348
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,645
Take out the belly button ring.

349
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,089
What?

350
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,225
You're beautiful.

351
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,632
Yeah?

352
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,934
Well, just keep
your hands to yourself.

353
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,119
You are perfect.

354
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,930
A spot-on upper-class bitch.

355
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,660
<i>... has been linked to the abduction...</i>

356
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,826
Shit.

357
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,965
<i>He disappeared from outside his club</i>

358
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,563
<i>in the early hours of Sunday morning.</i>

359
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,508
<i>Police believe he has been wounded</i>

360
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,511
<i>and may be in a serious condition.</i>

361
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,240
<i>In a tragic twist,</i>

362
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,440
<i>service station attendant</i>
<i>Terrance Gilmore</i>

363
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,450
<i>was apparently murdered</i>
<i>yesterday afternoon.</i>

364
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,112
<i>Police have released</i>
<i>this photo of a man</i>

365
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,383
<i>wanted for questioning</i>
<i>in relation to both matters.</i>

366
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,722
<i>He is 28-year-old</i>
<i>Ronald Jason Beron.</i>

367
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,523
<i>He is described</i>
<i>as armed and dangerous.</i>

368
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,928
<i>Beron is believed</i>
<i>to be traveling with a woman</i>

369
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,297
<i>described as a brunette,</i>
<i>and in her early twenties.</i>

370
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,235
<i>Police believe the couple</i>
<i>may still be in the area.</i>

371
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,466
<i>In other news,</i>
<i>Prime Minister John Howard</i>

372
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,439
<i>is meeting with cabinet today.</i>

373
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,308
They think your dickhead boss is alive.

374
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,243
That's why the choppers.

375
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,713
I can't go out there.

376
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:49,549
All right, that didn't look like you,
you're fine.

377
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,019
They're looking for a blue ute

378
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,647
that we are not driving anymore.

379
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,816
Don't make me do it.

380
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,655
Babe, they're looking for a brunette,

381
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,626
and you have blonde hair.

382
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,425
They're looking for a couple.

383
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,829
You're going to be on your own.

384
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,901
It's just shit that they
put out just to rattle us.

385
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,492
That's all.

386
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,071
Can't I go tomorrow?

387
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,539
Listen, if you do not go today,

388
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,041
and tomorrow,

389
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,077
we have to stay here
for another two weeks.

390
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,339
I can't go out there.

391
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,918
Well, I can't do it, can I?

392
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,494
You're doing it.

393
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,656
If you don't do this,

394
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,393
you might as well kiss
our future good-bye.

395
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,525
And don't cry.

396
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,879
That's my father
and that's Heather.

397
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,022
- <i>Gold.</i>
- Gold, Andy, gold!

398
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,718
<i>You didn't tell anyone?</i>

399
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,295
<i>Not for a couple of years,</i>
<i>and when the list came up,</i>

400
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,658
<i>I bought it.</i>

401
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,324
<i>I never looked back.</i>

402
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,994
- <i>Your father, the rogue.</i>
- <i>Trust</i> me...

403
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,730
You don't want to see that.

404
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,635
Your dad's an Aussie?

405
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,231
What the bloody hell
happened to you?

406
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,402
Your father's a rogue.

407
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,748
Wasn't that it?

408
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:25,975
It was perfect.

409
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,711
Gabrielle doesn't smoke, though.

410
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,751
Yeah, well, I do.

411
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,013
Hey.

412
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,048
Say something else.

413
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,092
Would you please cash this for me?

414
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,563
Would you...
Open your mouth.

415
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,133
Try and make the words more discreet.

416
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,929
Fuck off!

417
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,937
No one's going to believe I went
to some posh-ass school anyway.

418
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,904
Class is an attitude.
It's not about you.

419
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,839
Why don't you imagine
that everybody you meet

420
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,604
is younger than you are,

421
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,269
like they're 12.

422
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,373
Everyone you meet knows less
about the world than you do.

423
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,942
Would you please cash this for me?

424
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,146
Very good.

425
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,985
Good afternoon,
my name is Gabrielle Martin.

426
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,753
Good afternoon,
my name is Gabrielle Martin.

427
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,328
Perfect.

428
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,795
All right, school's over.

429
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:14,922
Let's go.

430
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,161
Good afternoon, I'm Miss Martin.

431
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,604
I have this check for you to cash.

432
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,275
Good afternoon,
I'm Gabrielle Martin.

433
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,175
I have this check for you to cash.

434
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,120
If you get stopped,

435
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,159
just tell them that you
picked up your old license.

436
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,657
It's just a fine.

437
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,228
Ronald, would you be a darling
and bring the car up for me?

438
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,736
Oh, sure, Miss...

439
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,738
Miss Martin.

440
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,408
Be right with you.

441
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,014
You know I wouldn't let you go

442
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,921
if I didn't think you could do it.

443
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,721
You just want to live, that's all.

444
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,386
Yes.

445
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,088
I do.

446
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,229
That's why I'm not worried about you.

447
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,976
So.

448
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,907
How do I look?

449
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,002
Gum.

450
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,075
Don't, Ronnie.
My lipstick.

451
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,001
Did a good job, Andy.

452
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,934
I hardly recognized her.

453
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,405
Glad you approve.

454
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,778
Oh, I didn't say that, did I?

455
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,114
So you enjoy yourself up there?

456
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,317
Dressing her up?

457
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,087
Doing her hair?

458
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,725
Hey, And, you can admit it.

459
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,925
She's hot. Right?

460
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,160
She's very sweet.

461
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,428
Come on, And!

462
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,561
You've been checking her out
ever since we got here.

463
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,969
No, I haven't. l...

464
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,268
You sayin' she's a dog?

465
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,172
No, of course I'm not.

466
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,744
So you have been checking her out.

467
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,438
No. She's your girl, Ron...

468
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,105
That's right, And!

469
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,650
That's right.
She's my girl.

470
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,815
And you wanna fuck her.

471
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,048
No, no. It's not true.

472
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,591
You think she's hot?

473
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,991
- And you'd like to fuck her.
- No, Ron.

474
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,187
You think she's hot,
and you'd like

475
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,490
- to fuck her.
- No!

476
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,190
You think she's hot,
and you'd like

477
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,493
- to fuck her!
- No, Ron!

478
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,932
You wanna fuck her,
don't ya? Yeah, Andy!

479
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,024
Come on!
You wanna fuck her!

480
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,604
Yes! All right! Yes!

481
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,105
I'm only fucking with you, Andy.

482
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,239
But maybe I'm not.

483
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,435
Next, please.

484
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,173
Next, please!

485
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,020
I've got this check
for you to cash.

486
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,254
l... I've left...

487
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,834
Shit.

488
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,744
It's a lovely piece, that.

489
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,811
Dressed in porcelain in Amalou.

490
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,445
That's 1780.

491
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,423
It's quite unusual. Look.

492
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,118
It's lovely.

493
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,753
Are you after anything
in particular?

494
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,058
No, just browsing.

495
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,157
Of course. Feel free.

496
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,292
Do you live locally?

497
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,938
Yes.

498
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,371
We're just out of town.

499
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,466
Well, look, let me get
you one of my cards.

500
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,977
I have contacts here
and overseas,

501
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,173
so often, if you're after
something specific,

502
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,113
I can source it for you.

503
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,583
But next time, you might want
to bring your partner in...

504
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:37,821
Or not.

505
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,260
I have this check
for you to cash.

506
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,763
Sure.

507
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,447
Now, your chick...

508
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,579
She's hot.

509
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,088
I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

510
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,388
- No.
- Good.

511
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,963
Because I'd really
like to fuck her.

512
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,692
I bet you she'd be
a goer, too. Huh?

513
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,200
She like it hard and fast?

514
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,332
Am I right?

515
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,878
She like a bit of dirty talk,
you know?

516
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,044
She like it when
you call her a slut?

517
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,449
Just when you're into it?
You know?

518
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,021
Just before she comes?

519
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,819
Give her a bit of, "You slut."

520
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,325
"You bitch."

521
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,388
She'd love that, wouldn't she?

522
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,465
What's she like
in the rumpy department, And?

523
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,400
She a moaner?

524
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,476
Or a screamer?

525
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,204
I bet you she's a screamer.

526
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,509
You're losing her, Ron.

527
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,755
- What?
- She's bored already.

528
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,881
- Haven't you noticed?
- Shut the fuck up.

529
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,221
She's slipping away.

530
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,429
How does that feel?

531
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,804
Knowing that you're...

532
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,204
not... quite...

533
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,276
adequate?

534
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,024
Come on!

535
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,790
If the phone rings out,
you're dead.

536
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,125
- Hello?
- <i>Andrew Shepard.</i>

537
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,324
Frank, yes.

538
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,664
<i>I need to verify some I.D.</i>

539
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,293
Gabrielle Elizabeth Martin.

540
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,733
Yes, it's my fiancée.

541
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,001
Okay. And password.

542
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,771
Restraint.

543
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,073
<i>All right.</i>

544
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:52,673
- <i>Good.</i>
- Yes.

545
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,182
Thank you. Yes.

546
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,445
We're gonna be doing
this again tomorrow.

547
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,485
Is that all right?

548
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,645
<i>Yes. That's fine.</i>

549
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,454
Want your license back?

550
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,327
We don't have anything larger.

551
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,423
So that's 10, 12, 14,

552
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,766
16, 18,

553
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,266
19, and 20,000.

554
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,737
Thank you.

555
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,658
Miss?

556
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,023
Excuse me. Miss.

557
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,959
This your car?

558
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,036
It belongs to my fiancé.

559
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,070
The door was unlocked.

560
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,607
I wouldn't do that around here.

561
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,242
Sorry.

562
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,489
Here's my money.

563
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,565
I did it. I actually did it, Andy.

564
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,536
It was extraordinary.
They believed everything that I was saying.

565
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,367
You know, they treated me
like I was someone special!

566
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,304
That's what I'm talkin' about, Andy.

567
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,378
You feel alive, huh?
You did good, baby!

568
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,946
You did good!

569
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,141
I just felt so comfortable.

570
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,548
Just shows, when one makes
a little bit of effort

571
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,051
with your appearance and whatnot,

572
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,951
and the attitude, darling,

573
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,081
the attitude of those around you
completely changes.

574
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,159
Yeah, well, you can
drop the attitude now.

575
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,989
She's amongst friends now,
isn't she, Andy?

576
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,495
Sorry, darling.
To what attitude do you refer?

577
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,929
The attitude, babe!

578
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,057
The accent, all right?
It's not funny!

579
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,661
I knew you could do it.

580
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,738
You could almost be her.

581
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,806
Gold!

582
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,306
We are celebrating tonight, my friends!

583
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,457
You ever order in, Andy?

584
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,191
- I'm sorry?
- You know.

585
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:56,421
Whores.

586
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,558
Hoochie mamas.

587
00:43:58,669 --> 00:43:59,727
You getting me?

588
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:04,971
What?

589
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,565
Six months without a screw?

590
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:09,009
No wonder you're tropo, mate!

591
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,946
Come on, And. You gotta learn
to live a little, you know?

592
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,573
I mean, look at that.

593
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:14,708
Now that's a disgrace, man.

594
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,547
You've been on that all night.

595
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,523
No wonder.

596
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:28,687
Hang on.

597
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,525
I know what you need.

598
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,094
Now where's the ice cream?

599
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,036
In the chest freezer, on the side.

600
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,165
By the fridge.

601
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,485
Can I introduce you
to a titillating sensation?

602
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,522
That's a hundred dollars a bottle, Ron.

603
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,033
There's some cheap stuff
in the fridge...

604
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,830
Fuck the cheap stuff.
We're celebrating, mate!

605
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,545
I give you... the champagne spider.

606
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,752
It's like poetry.

607
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,726
Come on. Give your
Master Tom a good swipe.

608
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,888
I really don't think it's my...

609
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,658
Oh, and you haven't even tried it!

610
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,366
Come on.

611
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,434
Well, I'll be damned.

612
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,670
Isn't that some gourmet shit?

613
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:49,871
Drink up, lads!

614
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,552
So what's with all
the paintings, mate?

615
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:00,884
You an art dealer?

616
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,420
I used to be.
I'm more of a collector now.

617
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,427
Right.

618
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,431
With your private income.

619
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,966
That's right.

620
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,403
I was also a dealer.

621
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,966
Dad was a druggie.

622
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,709
Your old man's in mining, right?

623
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,844
Among other things.

624
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,945
Little tension between
you and the old man, is there?

625
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,293
How about your mum?

626
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,954
She died a few years ago.

627
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,226
Sorry to hear it.

628
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,327
Mine's still around.

629
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,735
She breeds dogs.

630
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,104
That's what I'm gonna do, too.

631
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,680
Back.

632
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,945
Now what sort, you reckon?

633
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,078
- I have no idea, Ron.
- Just have a guess.

634
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,588
- I don't know...
- Go on, have a guess!

635
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,555
- I really don't know.
- Have a guess! Play the game!

636
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,154
Play the game.

637
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,394
Rottweilers? Pit bulls?

638
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,492
Poodles, mate.

639
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,968
Miniatures.

640
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,039
That's what I'm using
your money for in Thailand.

641
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,607
I'm gonna start my own kennel.

642
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,643
Look anywhere in Asia now.
What do you see?

643
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,769
Gucci. McDonald's.
Coca-fucking-Cola.

644
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,814
You see, they get to a certain level,

645
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,644
and they all want to be white.

646
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,183
Jesus, Ron!

647
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,777
You shut up, babe! Look.

648
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,824
Mercedes Benz.
Little bloody poodles!

649
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,257
Every little yellow bastard
is gonna want one,

650
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,158
either as a pet,

651
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,288
or on the barbie.

652
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,201
What?

653
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,435
I like it, Ron.

654
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,099
I think it's a very good idea.

655
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,109
I knew you'd get it!

656
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,270
- What's this one?
- It's jazz.

657
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,711
New Orleans-style.

658
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,214
- How do you play it?
- You don't.

659
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,113
It's never been played.
It's a first edition.

660
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,119
What's the point of having a record
if not you're gonna play it?

661
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,882
I just don't think
it's your type of thing.

662
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,592
Put the fucking thing on.

663
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,366
You know nothing about me.

664
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:28,904
All right? Nothing.

665
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,016
See, I like that. Yeah!

666
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,719
10 to <i>15</i> inches.

667
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:47,016
See, that's your miniatures.

668
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,183
Anything under that is just a toy.

669
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:50,555
Good water dogs.

670
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,241
What are you laughing at?

671
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,106
- Come on. Get up here.
- Come on, Andy.

672
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,042
- Go on.
- Get up.

673
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,609
Shake your tail feather, Andy!

674
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,379
That's it. Go on.

675
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,386
There he goes.

676
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,613
Come on.

677
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,949
You, too.

678
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,967
Dyin' for a fag.

679
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,240
Never.
Listen to me.

680
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,978
You will never make it to Thailand.

681
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,144
You won't even get a passport.

682
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,721
Ron's got friends
that can help us.

683
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,222
But things are different now.
There's all sorts of security checks.

684
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,122
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Things have changed, Dale.

685
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:09,062
Ron has murdered two people.
They're gonna catch up with you.

686
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,066
Ron!

687
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,979
Dale, listen to me.

688
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,571
Listen.

689
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,048
You haven't done anything wrong.

690
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,279
Look at you. You're...

691
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,448
You're beautiful.

692
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,425
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

693
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:41,623
You could turn yourself in
tomorrow and walk.

694
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,700
Walk to what, Andy?

695
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,928
Back to stripping?

696
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:51,504
Ron... He loves me
just the way that I am.

697
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,337
But you don't love you

698
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,274
the way you are.

699
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,107
Boo!

700
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,512
Found this outside, And.

701
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,607
I thought you might have lost it.

702
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,518
Now, you reckon
an art critic did this?

703
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,647
Or have you been up
to something naughty?

704
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,758
She left me.

705
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,328
Crap.

706
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,155
She left me, Ron, all right?

707
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,290
Bullshit!

708
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,932
She walked out
without any of her stuff...

709
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,472
her clothes, her makeup.

710
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,737
Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

711
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,278
you show me a broad
that would do such a thing.

712
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,577
She left me because my father...

713
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,678
paid her a great deal
of money to disappear.

714
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,390
And she did.

715
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,291
They met for lunch,
and I never saw her again.

716
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,066
Fuck me dead.

717
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,401
I thought my old man was harsh.

718
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,235
He always said
she was a gold digger.

719
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,576
I guess she was.

720
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,619
Well, this brought the night

721
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,252
to a rewarding end, didn't it?

722
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,074
They way he keeps all her stuff,

723
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,379
it's fuckin' sicko.

724
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,852
I think it's romantic,

725
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,389
like Miss Havisham.

726
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,219
Miss who?

727
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,426
Forget it.

728
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,555
I shot your boss's
fucking head off, all right?

729
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,793
I fucked up my whole fucking life.

730
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,927
Dale, have you ever
asked yourself once why?

731
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,562
Because you owed him money, Ron!

732
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,265
I fucked him so you'd have
more time to pay.

733
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,400
Yeah, and I killed him
to get you out of that.

734
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,807
You want to get me out of it?

735
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,402
You could've just paid him.

736
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,277
Just paid him, Ron.

737
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,253
Is that right?

738
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,448
You see,

739
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,720
I seen you talking on, Dale.

740
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,628
And you know what?
I don't care.

741
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,332
Because I know you love me.

742
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:36,433
Don't you?

743
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:42,038
Do you love me, Dale?

744
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,315
What do you think?

745
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,513
I got to believe you love me

746
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,849
because if I don't,

747
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,480
I might as well shoot my head off

748
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,559
right fucking now.

749
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,219
Do you love me, Dale?

750
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,168
Yes.

751
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,833
Good.

752
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,043
Instead of gawking
at this poor bitch,

753
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,145
why don't you see what's
right in front of your eyes?

754
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,727
- What do you mean?
- What's around her neck?

755
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,591
That must be <i>50</i> grand's worth.

756
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,830
I reckon you could get him
to tell you where it is.

757
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,128
You know?

758
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,063
Turn him on a little.

759
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,607
- Make him think you're hot for him.
- Oh, Ron.

760
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,339
What? You did it tonight
and you enjoyed it.

761
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,312
We were just having a bit of fun.

762
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,677
Hey.

763
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,546
I'm not saying fuck him, Dale.

764
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,712
I'm just saying, you know,

765
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,757
do what you did
every night at the club.

766
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,591
Are you too good for that now?

767
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,597
Isn't that what you wanted?

768
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,194
Yeah.

769
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,238
You're right.

770
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,605
I'll just break his fucking legs

771
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,336
and he's gonna
cough it up soon enough.

772
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:22,570
You fucking shit.

773
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,341
And that way, you can stay pure!

774
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,379
I'll do it.

775
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,454
That's my girl.

776
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,923
Why are you such an asshole?

777
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:42,898
We're not like him, Dale.

778
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,901
We're different.

779
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,685
Ron's going to break your legs
if you don't tell me where her jewelry is.

780
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,418
It's in the bank.

781
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,154
How do I get it?

782
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,232
I will tell you on one condition.

783
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,931
You get the money and the jewelry,

784
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,769
and then you call the police
and you disappear.

785
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:32,912
You must think I'm a bad person.

786
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,076
We've all done bad things
when we're desperate.

787
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,587
I'd be dead already
if it wasn't for you.

788
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,055
- How do I get it?
- Promise.

789
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:43,625
- Ron will get it out of you.
- Promise me

790
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,752
you'll take the money,
and you will go.

791
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,027
Then I promise.

792
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,575
It's in the safe deposit box
in the bank,

793
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,376
under Gabrielle's name.

794
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,110
The keys are in my pocket.

795
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,154
They're not here.

796
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,697
No.

797
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:27,030
They're in the music box
in the sunroom.

798
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,268
Fuck this.

799
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,323
Well?

800
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,524
Yep.

801
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,337
Your lipstick should be lighter.

802
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,599
It's fine.

803
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:45,901
It's not right.

804
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,237
It doesn't matter.

805
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,072
Gabrielle would never wear
that shade with that suit.

806
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,510
As if they care at the bank.

807
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,307
I'll change it.

808
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,748
Okay?

809
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:59,083
We might as well get it right.

810
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,229
Thank you, Ronald.

811
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,074
Don't forget who you are, Dale.

812
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,053
Bitch.

813
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,206
You think you could
possibly untie me,

814
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,576
so that I could give
Charlie some water?

815
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,736
No!

816
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,897
No, you... you fucker!

817
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,032
You bastard! You ape!

818
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,872
You stupid, dumb ape!

819
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,605
I guess I don't have
to untie you now.

820
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,271
You're never going
to get your money now!

821
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,440
It's just a bird, Andy.

822
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,916
God, I didn't cry that much
when my nana died.

823
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,179
Fuck you.

824
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,289
Sit down.

825
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,584
No.

826
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,759
- Sit down.
- No.

827
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,491
- Sit the fuck down.
- You're gonna kill me anyway.

828
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,827
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Sit down!

829
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,594
Fuck you!

830
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,682
<i>Hi, Mr. Shepard.</i>
<i>It's Frank Middleton.</i>

831
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,457
<i>Your fiancée's here</i>
<i>to cash a check.</i>

832
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:24,697
<i>Mr. Shepard?</i>

833
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:31,199
All right, Frank.

834
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,103
This will be the last time
that we do this.

835
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,543
<i>Yes, Mr. Shepard.</i>

836
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,308
<i>And your password, please?</i>

837
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,643
Restraint.

838
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,117
Game's over, And.

839
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,588
You don't have to kill me.

840
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,919
I got no choice.

841
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,290
You don't have to do it.

842
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,887
What about if I told you

843
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,727
that I had done something?

844
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,032
I've done things,

845
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:08,434
things that I can't
tell the police.

846
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,641
So you have been naughty, have you?

847
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,851
It's about my father.

848
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,898
He fucked her.

849
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,057
What?

850
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,397
My father.

851
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:36,528
Your father tumbled your fiancée?

852
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,608
That's why he...

853
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,701
he paid her off.

854
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,973
He wouldn't let us get married.

855
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,914
They were having an affair.

856
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,552
That's bad.

857
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,559
I just don't know
if that's bad enough.

858
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,629
I killed him.

859
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,100
I killed my father.

860
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,608
I paid a man

861
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,406
$100,000 in cash.

862
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,276
They made it look like an accident...

863
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,113
on his boat.

864
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,381
He gave me a photograph.

865
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,751
There's proof.

866
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,931
You could take it with you,

867
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,968
and you wouldn't have to kill me.

868
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,731
You would always have it over me.

869
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,645
I'd like to see this photograph.

870
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,552
Miss Martin to see you.

871
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,187
Miss Martin.

872
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,279
Come in.

873
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,923
Just need you to sign here.

874
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,126
Sure.

875
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,367
We've met before, I think.

876
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:20,670
Have we?

877
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:23,609
Can't think where.

878
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,112
It'll come to me.

879
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,011
Always does.

880
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,084
Come through.

881
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:39,422
Let me know when you're ready.

882
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,458
Turn the light on.

883
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,207
This way.

884
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,114
The photo's behind those pipes,
under that brick.

885
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,625
Go get them.

886
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,854
Can you untie me, please?

887
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,190
You see,

888
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,028
I thought we were becoming friends.

889
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,034
But you fucked me over.

890
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,305
So that'll be a no.

891
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,572
Yeah?

892
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,739
Well, I've been fucked over
my whole life.

893
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,654
Shit!

894
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:41,814
Andy!

895
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,656
Andy! Let me out!

896
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,959
Let me out! Andy!

897
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,696
You having fun yet, Andy?

898
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,966
I know I am!

899
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:27,755
Right.

900
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:30,764
Okay, I forgive you.

901
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:20,245
You have been a bad, bad boy!

902
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,624
Come here!

903
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,069
Oh, Mr. Shepard.

904
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,472
Sergeant Widdens,

905
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,907
what a surprise.

906
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:51,841
You all right, Mr. Shepard?

907
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,881
Yes, sir.

908
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:56,247
I've just been... Sorry.

909
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,944
Been cleaning up out the back.

910
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,043
Can I help you?

911
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:03,386
Well... do you mind
if we come in, sir?

912
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,016
No, actually,
as I said to you yesterday...

913
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,254
I really think it's time
you let us inside, sir.

914
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:10,628
I appreciate that.
I would like to, but...

915
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,793
to be honest,
I can't have people in my home

916
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,301
because of my condition.

917
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,871
All right.

918
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:19,600
We came by because
two very large checks

919
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,676
have been drawn against your account
in the last two days.

920
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,438
You aware of that?

921
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:26,480
Yes.

922
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:27,776
$20,000.

923
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,147
Made out to cash.

924
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,947
Yes, that's right.

925
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,624
Are you saying you
came by because the...

926
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,161
the bank contacted you?

927
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,730
They routinely monitor these things,

928
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,028
and they couldn't raise you
on the phone.

929
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,070
Shit.

930
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,482
My fiancée, Gabrielle Martin.

931
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,182
Miss Martin.

932
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,852
Sergeant.

933
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,725
Look at the state of you.

934
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:52,198
Been cleaning up in the...

935
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,734
in the basement.

936
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,566
Getting ready for the painters.

937
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,332
This place is falling apart.

938
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,033
She's back for one day

939
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:02,610
and she's running my life already.

940
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,338
I see.

941
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:07,745
Sometimes things work out,
don't they?

942
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,408
The cash withdrawals,

943
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,918
it's renovating money.

944
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,750
Just want to make sure
you're all right, sir.

945
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,189
Anyway,

946
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:19,658
happy renovating.

947
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,727
Me and my old man,

948
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,925
we saw this big fucking crash.

949
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:02,902
Big semi just went right
over the top of a little Jap job.

950
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,405
There's a girl stuck in the car.

951
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,634
I would've been about <i>15,</i> I guess.

952
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,975
Car is so dead.
The ambos are on the way.

953
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,546
And my dad, he can't get in there.

954
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,013
So I says, "Hey, Dad.

955
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,549
I can fit, I can get in there."

956
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,710
There's this little gap, right?

957
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,811
I get in.

958
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,221
Fuck me dead, the girl's alive.

959
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:27,091
I can just see her head,
her body's trapped in the car.

960
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,392
She'd be about <i>25,</i>

961
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,899
long, curly blonde hair,

962
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,731
pretty.

963
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,328
She's got blood on her forehead,

964
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,633
but she smiles, you know,

965
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,538
this big beautiful smile.

966
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,379
I said, "Are you okay?"

967
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,847
She's like, "Yeah, I'm fine."

968
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,748
So I keep her talking about
her dog and stuff, you know,

969
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,718
until finally, we hear the sirens

970
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,984
and it's time for me to get out.

971
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,718
And she says to me,

972
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:58,850
she says,

973
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,191
"Well, Ronnie, my name's Sara.

974
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:02,627
"When I get out of here,

975
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:05,359
I'm going to give you
the best night you've ever had."

976
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,794
Which to me, right, I'm, like, <i>15,</i>

977
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:11,031
so that's big news.

978
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,835
So I get out feeling
pretty good, right?

979
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:17,070
Then finally, the firies,

980
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,578
they have the jaws of life,

981
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,649
and they open the doors,

982
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,479
and her body's not connected

983
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,815
to her head.

984
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,354
Decapitated, right?

985
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,983
After that, no one looks me in the eye.

986
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,392
My old man,
he just pretends like it never happened,

987
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,124
like I'm crazy or something.

988
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:43,199
Well, I knew her name
was really Sara.

989
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,136
Isn't that spooky?

990
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,042
Anyway, Andy,
I'm telling you this story

991
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:53,308
because everything I ever had

992
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,680
has never been quite real.

993
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,218
It's just disappeared, you know,

994
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,914
like steam off a grate.

995
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,359
Except for Dale.

996
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,224
You see, she's real.

997
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,572
I fucking love you.

998
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,412
We're on our way to Thailand, baby!

999
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,482
Tell you what, though,
you had me worried.

1000
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,077
I thought the cops
might have picked you up.

1001
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:35,520
Just took longer than I thought.

1002
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,390
Now, be careful with this, okay?

1003
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:39,653
It's loaded.

1004
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,559
You don't want
to lose me at this point.

1005
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,400
So you're just going
to leave him here?

1006
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:51,606
What are you doing, Ron?

1007
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:53,334
Listen, Dale, it's not a bad way to go.

1008
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,239
And pass me the tape, will you?

1009
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,572
Ron, you promised.

1010
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,873
I know, but that was
more of a little white lie.

1011
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,945
You know that he had
his old man bumped?

1012
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,211
He's not just a babe
in the wood, Dale.

1013
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:05,911
Yeah, Gabrielle was
"writting" his old man,

1014
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,511
so he had him knocked off.

1015
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,454
How sick is that?
Now, the tape, Dale!

1016
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:10,718
No!

1017
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:11,952
Don't make me stand here.

1018
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,995
Let him go, Ron.

1019
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,592
Dale, we had no choice.

1020
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,295
We have no choice.
We never did.

1021
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,395
I don't want you to kill him.

1022
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,098
You'd better make
a fucking choice right now

1023
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,142
because there's gonna be
one dead prick in this room.

1024
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,302
- Stop it!
- Him or me, Dale?

1025
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,436
Stop it, Ron!

1026
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,946
- Him or me, Dale?
- Stop it!

1027
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:17,586
Think of this
as Dr. Ron's instant phobia cure.

1028
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,820
Now she's been in there
about five minutes.

1029
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,294
You get out there
and you turn that engine off,

1030
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:26,424
or hell, we'll just pull her
to the house, won't we?

1031
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,002
But if not,

1032
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,230
well, you'll have to live
with that, won't you?

1033
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:33,671
The man who couldn't walk
across his own backyard

1034
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,970
to save his girl.

1035
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,204
Go on, Andy.

1036
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,210
Come on, buddy!

1037
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:40,372
Come on, you pathetic prick!

1038
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,881
Giddyup there, Andy. Go on.

1039
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,678
Come on, Andy. Go on.

1040
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:45,877
That's it!

1041
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,215
Go on! That's it, Andy.

1042
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,481
Go on, that's it.
That's it.

1043
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,586
You're nearly there, Andy.

1044
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,561
Come on, And!

1045
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,360
Get up!

1046
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,662
Don't you quit on me,
Andy, come on!

1047
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:02,929
There we go!

1048
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,036
Oops!

1049
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,734
- Did I lock it?
- Dale! Dale!

1050
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,341
I'd make a bloody good shrink.
Don't you reckon, And?

1051
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,416
Dale!

1052
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,217
- At least you tried.
- Dale!

1053
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,720
Hey, hey.

1054
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,030
Fucking love this shit, Andy!

1055
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,139
How long you reckon
she's got, buddy?

1056
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,007
Three minutes or less?

1057
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:20,709
She's dying, Andy.

1058
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,484
You can run like
a bloody rabbit, Andy.

1059
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:33,661
Dr. Ron was spot on,
don't you reckon?

1060
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:51,037
That's because
we're the same, Andy.

1061
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,109
Except...

1062
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,243
I'm always one step ahead.

1063
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,324
Very good, Andy!
Very good!

1064
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,160
Come on, Andy!

1065
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,931
Is that all you got, Andy?
You can do better...

1066
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,179
Put your back into it, Andy.

1067
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:33,254
Do it.

1068
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,624
We're just the same, Andrew.

1069
01:21:58,313 --> 01:21:59,780
Dale. Dale.

1070
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,955
Dale, come on!

1071
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,655
Here we go.

1072
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:06,474
You gonna ring the cops?

1073
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,203
I have to.

1074
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,575
I've got two dead bodies
on my property.

1075
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,616
What about me?

1076
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,182
I suppose you'll do some time.

1077
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:22,415
You fucking shit.

1078
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:24,185
It's not as if the police aren't gonna

1079
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,192
work out what happened, Dale.

1080
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:28,319
I mean, what are our options?

1081
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,058
I saved your life.

1082
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:33,134
Twice.

1083
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:43,099
Don't you mean three bodies?

1084
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:45,840
Sorry?

1085
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,142
What about your dad?

1086
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:51,650
Isn't he buried out here?

1087
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,449
Daddy's alive and well

1088
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:57,423
and living in Melbourne.

1089
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:02,019
Wouldn't say we're exactly
on speaking terms, but...

1090
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,894
I didn't kill him.

1091
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,740
Say you love me...

1092
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:21,408
like Gabrielle would say it.

1093
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:22,881
"I love you."

1094
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:26,553
I love you.

1095
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:31,314
I don't believe you.

1096
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,957
I love you, Andrew.

1097
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,500
I love you.

1098
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:49,635
Say you want me, Gabrielle.

1099
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:53,673
I'm Dale, Andy.

1100
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:56,716
Call me Andrew, Gabrielle.

1101
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,013
Say you want me.

1102
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,678
I'm Dale.

1103
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:03,882
Yes, but say it like
Gabrielle would say it.

1104
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,789
Go on, say it.

1105
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:08,556
Yes?

1106
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,393
- I want you.
- Yes.

1107
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:38,925
Do you know where she is?

1108
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,459
No.

1109
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:43,929
Europe, I think.

1110
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,498
What if she comes back?

1111
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:48,830
She won't.

1112
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:51,971
Doesn't she have family?

1113
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:54,234
No, she lost touch with them.

1114
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,810
Do you know, I think she
even changed her name.

1115
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,811
Don't worry.

1116
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,007
She's
gone.

1117
01:28:01,348 --> 01:28:02,349
