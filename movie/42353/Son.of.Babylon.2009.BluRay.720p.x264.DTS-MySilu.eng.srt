<i>Northern Iraq, April 2003.
Three weeks after Saddam's fall.</i>

4
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,219
Grandma, a truck! There's a truck!

5
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,383
Stop! Stop! Stop!

6
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,942
Grandma, you scared him.

7
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,579
Grandma?

8
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,537
Grandma, is it a long way?

9
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,985
Grandma.

10
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,984
Grandma!

11
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,102
Fine. I'm going home!
Don't talk to me!

12
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,421
What is this?

13
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,062
Where did you come from?

14
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,255
Cant you hear me?
Get out of the way!

15
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,422
- Hello, Sir.
Get out of the way!

16
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,499
Peace be with you!

17
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,697
What peace?
What's this crazy woman doing?

18
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,657
She's not crazy,
she's my grandmother!

19
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,659
Get her out of my way!

20
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,617
- She won't!
- What do you want?

21
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,974
Take us with you.

22
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,059
- Where are you going?
- Nasiriyah.

23
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,496
- Nasiriyah? Both of you?
- Yes, both of us.

24
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,458
Nasiriyah is 600 miles from here!

25
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,134
Why don't you walk?

26
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,939
OK... 500 dinars to take you
to Baghdad.

27
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,736
What?

28
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,299
Are you crazy?
- Get off then!

29
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,098
50 dinars, that's it!

30
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,818
Why are you cheating us?

31
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,459
- Thief!
Enough or I'll beat you.

32
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,818
Grandma, don't give him money!
- Your grandma's nice.

33
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,938
No, no, no! It's full here!
Get in the back!

34
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,979
Your grandma's really nice.
This woman pays good money.

35
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,819
Cheat!

36
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,461
OK, OK... call me what you want,
I've got the money now.

37
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,101
Cheat!

38
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,823
SON OF BABYLON

39
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,537
Enough! Enough!

40
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,174
Enough, my brain's about to explode!
Stop that whistling!

41
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,859
It's my father's flute!

42
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,699
I don't care!

43
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,455
Play something good,
like Michael Jackson!

44
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,459
- Who?
- Michael Jackson!

45
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,939
Who's that?
The Mayor of your town?

46
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,739
No, he isn't
the Mayor of my town.

47
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,936
He's the Mayor of America!

48
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,735
- What?
- America, America!

49
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,099
I don't care,
I'm playing my dad's flute.

50
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,899
Do whatever,
just don't blow my brains out!

51
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,144
Dad!

52
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,824
Dad, where are you?

53
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,017
The echo in this tunnel sounds
better than this flute!

54
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,104
Dad!

55
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,778
What are you doing?
You're wasting your time!

56
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,182
Damn! I can't fix it!

57
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,537
You want a smoke?

58
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,978
Where is your mother?

59
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,857
She's dead.

60
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,697
Your father too?

61
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,337
He's in Nasiriyah,
we're going to see him.

62
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,179
He's a brave man,
he saved his friends life.

63
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,500
A brave man? Alright!

64
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:19,059
Grandma promised to take me
to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

65
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,016
- What? The Gardens of Babylon?
- The Hanging Gardens of Babylon!

66
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,775
- What gardens?
- Didn't you study history at school?

67
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,853
Wherever you want to go, I don't care.
Babylon, Hanging Gardens or wherever.

68
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,137
I need the toilet,
I'm going to call Saddam.

69
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,494
What?

70
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,859
Hello?

71
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,099
How are you doing Mr. Saddam?

72
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,579
Damn you, you loser.

73
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,017
- Grandma, come! He's calling Saddam!
- What you did to us will happen to you.

74
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,024
Screw your mother,
you son of a bitch!

75
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,019
Saddam is a bastard
and the Americans are pigs!

76
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,624
What's this?

77
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,060
Hello, America!

78
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,779
What are you wearing?

79
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,139
What? What?

80
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,780
I said not to touch
your father's jacket!

81
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,737
Hello, Mister? Mister?

82
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,339
I'll be a soldier like Dad.

83
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,742
Your dad was forced,
he wanted to be a musician!

84
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,619
Son of a bitch!

85
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,376
Hold you already, you'll go to school
and become a doctor or an engineer!

86
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,101
We have to spend the night here.

87
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,101
Alright!

88
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,982
I'm sure American dogs
live better than us.

89
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,939
Aren't you ashamed to bring this child
to such a dangerous place?

90
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,615
I've waited 12 years for this day.
He needs his father.

91
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,976
You shouldn't have,
it's too dangerous.

92
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,656
What choice do I have? I have nobody!
He needs to see his father.

93
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,779
How do you know he's alive
and not in one of Saddam's mass graves?

94
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,456
What God are you talking about?

95
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,019
Why do you need your son
if your have faith?

96
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,899
Why not pray for these poor people
to get out of this miserable situation?

97
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,379
God is unquestionable,
it is the fault of men.

98
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,656
You have no right to question God.

99
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,379
I haven't seen my daughter in two years.
She married a man I didn't approve of.

100
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,939
I keep praying to God. "God! God!"

101
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,695
Yet I haven't seen her.
It's been so long, I keep waiting.

102
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,374
Why isn't she back yet?

103
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,339
When we lose a child
a part of us dies.

104
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,019
Maybe. Anyway, it's getting late.

105
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,456
You and the boy, sleep in the car.
I'll sleep outside.

106
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,419
Tomorrow, we'll see
what your God has planned.

107
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,058
Come on.

108
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,139
<i>Oh Kurdistan, oh Kurdistan.</i>

109
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,383
<i>You are my homeland.</i>

110
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:50,781
<i>There is no place like it
on Earth.</i>

111
00:12:51,420 --> 00:13:00,374
<i>Why do you hurt us?</i>

112
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,384
<i>Why do you hurt
the Kurds in Iraq?</i>

113
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,099
<i>Thousands of Arabs
have suffered.</i>

114
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,296
<i>Oh, and many more people.</i>

115
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,579
<i>Oh, many poor people....</i>

116
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,219
<i>Orphans, Anfal's victims
and the helpless.</i>

117
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,021
<i>Oh my God, oh my God.</i>

118
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,463
Grandma?

119
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,342
Grandma, what's Anfal?

120
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,859
Don't you know about Anfal?

121
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,819
Anfal was when Saddam the tyrant
wanted to destroy Iraq.

122
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,778
He started in Kurdistan
then went down South,

123
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,418
killing both Kurds and Arabs.

124
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,139
He destroyed every single house
and village on his way

125
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,258
and he killed everyone: children,
families and elderly people.

126
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,656
This is Anfal,
do you understand?

127
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,053
WELCOME TO BAGHDAD

128
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,904
Do what you want, you own the world.

129
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,858
While we stay down here and suffer.

130
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,137
Here it is, Alawi Bus Station.

131
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,177
Get out here,
but you better hurry up!

132
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,379
Madam, wait!

133
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,462
Madam! Excuse me, wait!

134
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,459
Here, this is yours.

135
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,657
Please take it.
I hope you find your son.

136
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,899
Goodbye.

137
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,302
Come here.

138
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:35,819
Son, take this.

139
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,573
Look after your grandma,
beware of dogs and wolves.

140
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,455
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!

141
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,659
Goodbye Uncle!

142
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,099
Grandma, there's no bus!

143
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,174
Can you see that man
near the cart?

144
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,857
Why can't you speak Arabic?

145
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,218
Why? Why? Learn Arabic!

146
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,185
What did he say?

147
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,822
He said my Arabic is good.

148
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,820
Ahmed!

149
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,899
He said there's no bus to Nasiriyah
but we should wait over there.

150
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,303
Cigarettes! Cigarettes!

151
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,902
Grandma, I'm hungry.

152
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,096
Read it again?
I've read it 100 times for you!

153
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,578
I'm sick of reading it
again and again!

154
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,576
<i>"In the name of God.</i>

155
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,138
<i>My name is Yousef Ali.</i>

156
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,019
<i>I was with your son Ibrahim
in the Kuwait war in 1991.</i>

157
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,584
<i>Our unit was attacked
by the American and coalition forces.</i>

158
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,014
<i>I wanted to write earlier.</i>

159
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,259
<i>I'm sorry to say that your son Ibrahim
was arrested by the Baathist party.</i>

160
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,774
<i>They took him to prison, to...</i>

161
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,418
<i>to Nasiriyah prison."</i>

162
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,016
Give me my money!

163
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,103
Fair is fair!

164
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,495
Give me my money!
It's only 50 dinars! I'm not begging!

165
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,896
Give me my money!

166
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,339
Five cigarettes for 250 dinars!

167
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,503
War is on, but I stay open!
Come on!

168
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,579
Nasiriyah! Nasiriyah!

169
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,537
Nasiriyah! Nasiriyah Prison!

170
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,979
Where's Ahmed?

171
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,742
Where is he? Excuse me?

172
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,779
Have you seen my grandson?

173
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,737
Sony, I don't speak Kurdish.

174
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,219
My son?

175
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,899
- What's wrong?
Did you see a small boy with big eyes?

176
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,815
For God's sake, have you seen him?

177
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,379
- Don't you want money?
- No, I'm no beggar!

178
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,541
I don't understand!

179
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,539
- Please. I'm looking for my little boy.
- Sorry, we don't speak Kurdish.

180
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,219
- Help me.
- We don't understand.

181
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:06,014
Has anyone seen my little boy?

182
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,979
He's gone! Ahmed, my son!
What's happened to him?

183
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,979
Five cigarettes for 250 dinars!

184
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,300
Here are five cigarettes.

185
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:18,895
What are you doing?
I said 100 times not to leave me!

186
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,982
Qasim, don't worry, it's my grandma!
Take the cigarettes!

187
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,014
- Qasim, Jasim? What's this about?
- You said that I should help people!

188
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,860
Thank you.

189
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,824
Take the bag.

190
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,179
Stop! There are no more seats.

191
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,741
Grandma! Grandma!

192
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,139
Grandma, come back!

193
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,416
Don't be afraid!

194
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,223
Grandma, don't leave me!

195
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,939
- Start collecting the bus fare!
- Driver, do something about that boy.

196
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,218
What's wrong with him?
- Driver, stop!

197
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,984
Sit down, stop screaming!

198
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,375
Stop!

199
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,539
Open the door!

200
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:43,419
Mister, his grandma's here!
Ahmed, your grandma's here!

201
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,698
An old woman's running after the bus
and he's asked you to stop!

202
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,456
What old woman?
I could have killed you!

203
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,378
Grandma, don't leave me again.

204
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,056
Thank God!

205
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,696
I don't speak Kurdish.
Is this midget with you?

206
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,862
- No, I'm not with her.
- Get off then!

207
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,696
Get on! We're in a hurry!

208
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,019
How could you take him
away from me?

209
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,181
See you later, Qasim!

210
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,977
Ahmed! Come back to Baghdad!

211
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,257
You know when people hurt us,
we have to learn how to forgive them.

212
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,264
Your dad will be proud of you
for looking after me.

213
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,543
I'll tell him how you were stuck

214
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,341
with your bottom out of the window!

215
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,739
You tool

216
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,543
I'll tell him how you ran after the bus
like a headless chicken screaming.

217
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,063
"Ahmed! Ahmed!"

218
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,337
NASIRIYAH 40 km

219
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,344
The road is blocked.

220
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,737
Everyone go to sleep, it's safe.

221
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,582
Ahmed, darling,
why don't you sleep?

222
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,779
Grandma, I'm scared.

223
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,942
What are you scared of, my son?

224
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,299
I'm scared of dying.

225
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,499
No, we won't die, my dear.
We will live forever.

226
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,979
Grandma, no one lives forever.

227
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,062
Let me tell you a story.

228
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,899
Once upon a time...

229
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,497
There was an old prophet
who God loved very much.

230
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,579
He asked God for a gift.

231
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,383
God blessed him with a son
who he adored.

232
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,819
One day, God ordered for the prophet
to sacrifice his son.

233
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,735
He told him: "Son, I need to sacrifice
you in the name of God".

234
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,737
The son replied:
"Father, blindfold me".

235
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,779
"This way, you won't see my eyes."

236
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:28,499
He blindfolded his son
and put the knife to his neck.

237
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,777
When all of a sudden, a ram
descended from Heaven

238
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,819
and a voice whispered
to the prophet.

239
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:47,582
"Slaughter the ram,
not your son."

240
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,935
Mister, I'm going to the toilet!

241
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,693
- What?
- I'm going to call Saddam!

242
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,103
I'm too busy for Saddam now,
I have my own problems.

243
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,098
Mr. Hasan, pass me a spanner,
please.

244
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,704
THE HOUSE OF PROPHET IBRAHIM

245
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,015
Grandma! Grandma!

246
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,216
Ibrahim! Ibrahim!

247
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,139
Your father?

248
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,939
Not Dad, Prophet Ibrahim!

249
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,817
Alright, alright.

250
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,339
Here we are, get off now.

251
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,899
- Take us to the prison!
How? I've run out of gas!

252
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,459
Ahmed, let's go.

253
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,704
I'm not going to Nasiriyah,
it's too dangerous.

254
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,662
Hurry up, get off the coach!

255
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,497
Where is the Nasiriyah prison?

256
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,903
What Nasiriyah?
I don't understand you, get off?

257
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,981
Ahmed, Ahmed.

258
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,301
- You're hurting me, I'm sleepy.
- Wake up!

259
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,379
We need to get to the prison,
everybody left.

260
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,619
How am I supposed
to know the way?

261
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,375
People talked about it on the bus,
lets follow them!

262
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,381
Fine, I'll lead.
You follow me.

263
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,179
Over there!

264
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,854
Dirty Baathist dog!

265
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,263
Ahmed.

266
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,782
Ahmed, don't be scared.
Don't go too far.

267
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,024
Where are we?

268
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,975
- Grandma, I think we're lost.
- No, were not.

269
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,295
Grandma...

270
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,577
I don't like this place.
I'm scared and hungry.

271
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,538
- Why are you scared?
- I'm really scared, Grandma.

272
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,816
Darling, don't be scared.

273
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,979
Can you see that high building
over there?

274
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,539
Go to the top, you'll see
where people are going.

275
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,293
Then, I'll follow you.

276
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,254
- No, I'm scared.
- Darling, don't be scared and go.

277
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,099
Police?

278
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,662
Police?

279
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,255
Hello!

280
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,861
Is anybody there?

281
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,742
Grandma!

282
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,459
Grandma I can see them!
They're going in that direction.

283
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,698
Ahmed.

284
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,659
Can't you see?
They're over there!

285
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,819
Ahmed.

286
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,779
Grandma, the prison is over there
That's where everyone is going!

287
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,182
I don't want your dad
to see you dirty like this.

288
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,778
Grandma, the water is too cold.

289
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,179
Are they nice?

290
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,898
- Yes, Grandma.
- They suit you.

291
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,784
Grandma, you're lovely.

292
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,780
What?

293
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,304
Grandma, please!

294
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,464
Come on, let's go inside.

295
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,176
If you're looking for missing relatives,
go to the information desk.

296
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:58,699
<i>Your beautiful face
is buried under the sands.</i>

297
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,024
<i>My heart is bleeding for you,
my boy.</i>

298
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,419
<i>Your beautiful face
is buried under the sands.</i>

299
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,059
<i>Eid has come
and my king's no longer here.</i>

300
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,699
<i>He is buried under the sands.</i>

301
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,900
<i>Eid has come, I lost my king.</i>

302
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,897
Grandma, come on.

303
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,183
- Hello, Sir.
- Hello.

304
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,697
We're looking for my father, Ibrahim.

305
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,499
- Ibrahim what?
- Ibrahim Khalil Sharhoh.

306
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,302
Check on your list
for Ibrahim Khalil Sharhoh.

307
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,938
- Ibrahim isn't on the list.
- Please check again.

308
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,261
What is he saying?

309
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,854
A new mass grave has been found.
Maybe you should try there.

310
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,454
No, you're lying!
You're a liar!

311
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,656
- What is he saying?
- You also lied!

312
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,301
What is he saying? Ahmed!

313
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,740
Dad!

314
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,779
Dad, where are you?

315
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,694
I haven't seen you in 12 years!
Where are you?

316
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,657
Dad!

317
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,097
Dad, where are you?

318
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,655
Dad, where are you?

319
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,383
Ibrahim, where are you,
my son?

320
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,102
My son, come here!

321
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,303
Ibrahim, my son,
your wife waited for you.

322
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,655
Ibrahim, my son, were you here?

323
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,654
Your son has grown up!

324
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,062
Your dad was here.

325
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,939
Baghdad, Baghdad!

326
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,459
Sit down here.

327
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,899
Are you alright?

328
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,224
- Madam, are you alright?
- Yes.

329
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,458
Do you understand me?

330
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,339
Can you speak Arabic?

331
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,184
You can? Good.

332
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,737
Can you play the flute?

333
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,544
It's a nice flute.

334
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,618
It's my dad's.

335
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,822
My grandma says that if I play well
like my dad, I'll become a musician.

336
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,254
Is your dad a musician?

337
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,698
I'll give you an orange.

338
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,302
Oranges are good when you travel.

339
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,659
Where are these oranges?
Here's one

340
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,298
Good, I have some left.

341
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,939
Take it.

342
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,216
One for you and one
for your grandma.

343
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,381
Playing the flute is your hobby,
isn't it?

344
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,379
Watch me, watch me.

345
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,337
I'll show you.

346
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,213
You want me to show you again?

347
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,623
Watch... I mean, show me.

348
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,339
I can't make them, its too windy.

349
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,499
- You have to get off.
- Try to fix it.

350
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,377
It's a long way to Baghdad.

351
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,499
The coach is broken.

352
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,659
The driver said it was broken.

353
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,178
- Come on, guys, make your own way.
- Where do we go now?

354
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,936
Madam, the coach is broken.
We have to get off.

355
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,939
Come on, Madam.

356
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,223
Come on, come on.

357
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,900
Come on, hurry up!

358
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,134
What?

359
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,178
- Give us our money back
What are you talking about?

360
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,979
You cheated us.
You didn't take us to Baghdad.

361
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,379
Is money all you care about?
- Give it back!

362
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,461
Fair is fair!

363
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,460
Oh my God!

364
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,456
For two people, my grandma and me.

365
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,703
You only care about money.
Here you go.

366
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,579
Actually, it's for three.

367
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,220
My Lord.

368
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,104
Give us our money back!

369
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,976
WELCOME TO BABYLON

370
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,378
I like wearing my father's army jacket.
I want to become a soldier.

371
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,654
- Really?
- Yes!

372
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,539
No, why do you want to be a soldier?

373
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,619
- I'm strong.
- But I'm stronger.

374
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,258
Come, let's run like soldiers.

375
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,983
I'll show you how they run in the army.
One, two, three, one, two, three...

376
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,138
You have a lovely boy.

377
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,858
I'm worried,
he wants to be a soldier.

378
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,296
When he grows up,
he'll forget about it.

379
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,940
Where did you learn
how to speak Kurdish?

380
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,579
I was 18.

381
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,983
The Baathists took me to the North
and forced me to work.

382
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,945
What kind of work?

383
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,381
What kind of work?

384
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,865
I was forced.

385
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,458
I had to attack villages.

386
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,975
I killed.

387
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,179
I killed women.

388
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,979
- You were part of the Anfal!
- No.

389
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,779
Believe me, I was forced.

390
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,057
I had been in the Republican Guard
for two months.

391
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,495
If I had run,
they'd have killed me.

392
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,776
You should have died,
you're a murderer!

393
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,218
Murderer! Don't speak!

394
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,536
Get away from us!

395
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,779
Getaway, now! Don't speak!

396
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,896
- You killed many of my relatives!
- Please, understand...

397
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,976
You're a murderer! Leave us now!

398
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,659
You're as bad as Saddam!

399
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,264
Enough! Stop!

400
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,456
Get away, you murderer!

401
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,777
- Grandma...
- Ibrahim, where are you?

402
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,619
Come and help me, my son!

403
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,213
Murderer!

404
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,982
Fine.

405
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,499
Get away, murderer!

406
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,778
- How do you know?
- He's a murderer!

407
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,181
I'll help you.

408
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,585
Ibrahim.

409
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,499
Where's Ahmed?

410
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,979
Ahmed!

411
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,418
Where did he go?

412
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,943
From here, you tum it off.

413
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,898
Grandma, what do you want?

414
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,499
Come here!

415
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,337
What's wrong, Grandma?
Musa's a nice man.

416
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,139
Why do you want him to leave?

417
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,139
Um-Ibrahim?

418
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,379
I can't leave you out here alone.

419
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,779
I've heard there's a prisoner
at the mosque near here.

420
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,943
I said. I heard there's a prisoner
at the mosque.

421
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,019
Musa, tell my grandma...

422
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,339
Ahmed!

423
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,580
Come here.

424
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,699
Grandma, you remember
when we were on the coach?

425
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,659
You told me when people hurt us,
we still need to forgive them.

426
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,499
Walk in front of me.

427
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,740
Fine.

428
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,257
- Hello, Sheikh.
- Hello.

429
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,898
- How are you?
- All good.

430
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,016
It's nice to have you here.

431
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,934
- How are you?
- She's asking how you are.

432
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,939
- Sheikh. I need your help.
- First, come in.

433
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,774
Thank you, but we're in a hurry.

434
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,535
She's from the North.
Her son's been missing since 1991.

435
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:59,099
Yesterday, I heard
that a prisoner was brought here

436
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,819
She'd like to check,
maybe it's her son.

437
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,778
- Who told you about him?
- Some good people.

438
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,818
I'm sure you understand.

439
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,255
Musa, this man is not for show.

440
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,458
He's ill and disfigured.

441
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,499
- He's almost dead.
- Yes, I know, but still...

442
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,139
We hope it might be her son.

443
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,017
Ahmed, what is he saying?

444
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:28,535
Um-Ibrahim, there's a man inside
but he is disfigured.

445
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,861
You can't see him.

446
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,145
Sheikh, please!

447
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,495
You know what children
mean to their mothers.

448
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,255
- I've been searching for 12 years.
- She's begging you.

449
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,179
I came a very long way.

450
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:49,139
I went from Baghdad
to Nasiriyah, then to Hilla.

451
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:53,099
I pray to God to find him here.
May God help!

452
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,137
May God bless you.

453
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,893
Do you know what a mother feels?

454
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,655
I have suffered so long,
I've counted the months and years.

455
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,819
Please, I beg you!

456
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,299
No, don't.

457
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,699
- She just wants to see him.
- Please, don't.

458
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,864
We really need your help,
she's alone.

459
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,614
Follow me.

460
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,264
Darling, stay here.

461
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,579
I'm going to see
if it's your father or not.

462
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,494
- But he's my father too!
- Um-Ibrahim, it's fine. I'll stay here.

463
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,264
Come with me.

464
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,733
Peace be with you.

465
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,304
Come in, Madam.

466
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,295
Madam, come in.

467
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,174
Ahmed?

468
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,823
Why don't you play your flute?

469
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,816
What do you think
about teaching me how to play?

470
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,822
I can play, of course,
but you're a little better.

471
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,814
Just a little?
I won't teach you then.

472
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,175
You're the master, of course!

473
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:13,579
I thought you could teach me here,
next to Nimrod's ruins where it's quiet.

474
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,139
What do you think?

475
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,619
OK, your first lesson is to stand up.

476
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,699
- Stand up?
- Yes, respect your teacher.

477
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,702
Of course.

478
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,700
I'm standing.

479
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,622
You're too tall,
I need to stand up too.

480
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:38,179
Second lesson,
straighten your back.

481
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,014
Like this?

482
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,418
OK, done.

483
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,415
Your mouth.

484
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,543
- My mouth too?
- Yes.

485
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,258
It's OK, Grandma.

486
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,377
Let's go home.

487
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,741
Sorry for bothering you.

488
00:59:19,742 --> 00:59:22,459
No, don't mention it.
Where are you going?

489
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,459
I don't know,
maybe to the coach station.

490
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,939
There are mass graves,
why don't you try there?

491
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,738
Musa, we're going home.

492
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,979
I'll take them to the station,
then we'll see.

493
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,383
- Goodbye.
- God bless you.

494
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,419
Musa?

495
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,499
- Where are the Hanging Gardens?
- Near here.

496
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,299
- What do they look like?
- Like stacked up platforms.

497
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,619
There were no pumps
to take the water up.

498
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,897
They took it up themselves
and it would come down.

499
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,540
Do you know the story
behind them?

500
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:17,539
Once upon a time,
a king married a queen.

501
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,419
She came from mountains
and greenlands.

502
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:26,177
She got bored of the desert,
so do you know what the king did?

503
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,979
He built the Hanging Gardens
because he loved her so much.

504
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,382
It's true. If we have time,
I'll take you there.

505
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:37,139
Grandma promised to take me too.

506
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,814
If we get near them,
I'll take you.

507
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,504
Who are they?

508
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,698
Pull over.

509
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,894
What's this?

510
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,462
These are bodies from mass graves
that have just been found.

511
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,018
Victims from 1991.

512
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,539
Grandma?

513
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,978
Grandma, what's wrong?

514
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,823
We have to take him back home
with us.

515
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,744
What do you mean?

516
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,824
We're not going home anymore?

517
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,294
Ahmed, stay here.

518
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,502
Don't go near the graves.
Razzak, look after him!

519
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,616
Tell me, how can I help
my grandma?

520
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,984
She's sick.

521
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,457
I don't know what to do.

522
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,257
Can you play the flute?

523
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,334
Can you?

524
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,456
- Ibrahim Khalil Sharhoh.
- He's not here.

525
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,699
I heard there was
another mass grave in Mahaweel.

526
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,019
- He's not here?
- No.

527
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,977
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

528
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,059
- Thank you.
- God help you.

529
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:36,143
- His name is Ibrahim Khalil Sharhoh.
- He's not here.

530
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:45,695
You keep saying that he's not here
without letting me ask.

531
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,614
Sit down there.

532
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,383
See what's happened to us.

533
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,615
I don't understand,
what are you saying?

534
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:25,459
We were only married for a year
when they took him away.

535
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,896
Ahmed grew up without his father.

536
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:33,337
He left Fattima, she's 12 now.
Everyday she asks about her father.

537
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:39,097
I've been looking in prisons,
now I'm looking among the graves.

538
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,858
Yet, I still can't find him.

539
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,098
Hello.

540
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,861
Here's some water.

541
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,974
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

542
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:54,619
I don't speak Kurdish
but I can feel her pain and sadness.

543
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,497
- You spoke to her?
- Yes.

544
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,264
She lost her son.

545
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,335
Um-Ibrahim.

546
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,979
Come on, let's go.

547
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,779
- I'll help her.
- Thank you. God bless you.

548
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:26,738
Grandma, don't cry.
I'll help you look for Dad.

549
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:30,301
That's her grandson, Ahmed.

550
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,576
Um-Fattima, it's OK,
we have a ride.

551
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:42,574
You can go, don't worry.

552
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,335
Thank you.
Razzak is waiting for us.

553
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,456
Come, Razzak is waiting for us.

554
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,415
Stop.

555
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,014
Ahmed, what's wrong?

556
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,218
Musa... I will go with my grandma.

557
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,143
- Yes, let's go.
- No, Musa.

558
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:17,059
Please, understand.
I need to take my grandma, alone.

559
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,414
Why?

560
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,937
You can't come with us,
you need to go home.

561
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,534
Ahmed, why?

562
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,497
Musa, my dear.

563
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,222
My son was forced to join the army.

564
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,102
This is what happened to him.

565
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,464
Thank you very much.

566
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,414
I forgive you.

567
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,339
Um-Ibrahim, I want to stay
and help you.

568
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:45,696
Musa, my dear,
you've done so much for us.

569
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,661
I forgive you.

570
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,175
Ahmed.

571
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,186
God bless you.

572
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,216
Stay close to your grandma.

573
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:11,424
If you have any problems,
go back to the Mosque.

574
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,304
Goodbye, Musa.

575
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,177
Goodbye, Musa.

576
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,265
Ahmed!

577
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,817
I'll take you to Babylon.

578
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,773
I'll show you the Hanging Gardens.

579
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:20,899
<i>Oh, injured brother,
oh, injured brother.</i>

580
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:24,859
<i>Wake up so that I may
treat your wounds.</i>

581
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:29,576
<i>Babylon and Aur miss you.</i>

582
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:35,219
<i>Even birds cry for you.</i>

583
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:39,619
<i>Oh mother, we look for
our lost loved ones.</i>

584
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:44,899
<i>Oh, our lost loved ones.</i>

585
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:52,619
<i>We sleep and stay near Babylon.</i>

586
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,863
<i>We sleep and stay.</i>

587
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:06,343
<i>Losing our sons is
like losing our souls.</i>

588
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:17,103
<i>We only want him to walk
with the other boys.</i>

589
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:23,703
<i>They put their jackets
over their shoulders.</i>

590
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,099
Grandma...

591
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,376
I don't want to be a soldier.

592
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,736
I want to become a musician,
like Dad.

593
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,181
Grandma?

594
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,305
Grandma?

595
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:34,739
Grandma, I'm going to ask
that man.

596
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:54,699
Ibrahim! My son, where are you?

597
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,819
He's not here.
Most bodies have no ID.

598
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,539
There's no equipment
to identify them.

599
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,459
New mass graves were found.
You should check there.

600
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,462
One minute.

601
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:23,100
Oh my son.
Oh my son, I miss you.

602
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:31,336
I looked everywhere for you.

603
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,936
The man said that he's not here.

604
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,421
They found another mass grave,
we should go there.

605
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,183
Grandma, please.

606
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,699
Please, Grandma...

607
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,779
Grandma, look at this.
His name is Omar.

608
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,020
Grandma!

609
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,743
Grandma, this one's called Salem.

610
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,974
Grandma!

611
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,497
Grandma, this one is called Jawad!

612
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:37,055
Grandma, this one isn't clear.
It has no name on it.

613
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,574
Oh my Lord.

614
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,776
Grandma, stop crying please.

615
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,182
Please, Grandma...

616
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,458
I've had enough!

617
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,499
Grandma, please!
Stop it, I beg you.

618
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:05,062
Ibrahim, my dear son.

619
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,975
Stop it.
Let's go, please.

620
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:31,862
Ibrahim.

621
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,658
What is it, Grandma?

622
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,854
I'm not Ibrahim.

623
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,136
I remember when he was a baby.

624
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,538
When he was a baby...

625
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,059
Um-Fattima, what's this?

626
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,221
The remains of Babylon.

627
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,575
Grandma!

628
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:08,616
Grandma, don't leave me alone!

629
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,698
Grandma, we are in Babylon!
