1
00:00:43,167 -> 00:00:47,558
Northern Iraq, April 2003
Three weeks after the fall of Saddam

2
00:02:15,607 -> 00:02:19,998
Grandma, there's a truck.

3
00:02:20,127 -> 00:02:21,526
Stop.

4
00:02:39,647 -> 00:02:41,877
Grandma, he was startled by you.

5
00:03:07,887 -> 00:03:09,400
Grandma?

6
00:03:11,047 -> 00:03:14,357
Grandma, it's far?

7
00:03:15,247 -> 00:03:16,839
Granny.

8
00:03:19,247 -> 00:03:21,317
Granny.

9
00:03:21,447 -> 00:03:24,962
Then I go home.
Say nothing more.

10
00:03:52,127 -> 00:03:56,359
What happens here?
Where are you from?

11
00:03:56,487 -> 00:04:00,002
Do you hear me?
On the side.

12
00:04:00,127 -> 00:04:02,243
Day, sir.
-Get out.

13
00:04:02,367 -> 00:04:04,244
Peace be with you

14
00:04:04,367 -> 00:04:09,361
What do you mean peace? What is this crazy?
-She is not crazy. It's my grandmother.

15
00:04:09,487 -> 00:04:12,240
Get her away.
-No.

16
00:04:12,367 -> 00:04:16,804
What do you want?
Take-us. Go to Nasiriyah.

17
00:04:16,927 -> 00:04:23,162
Nasiriyah? Both?
Nasiriyah is 1000 km away.

18
00:04:23,287 -> 00:04:25,960
Why are not you?

19
00:04:27,567 -> 00:04:30,684
For 500 dinars I'll take you
to Baghdad.

20
00:04:30,807 -> 00:04:35,835
Are you crazy?
50 dinars, nothing more.

21
00:04:35,967 -> 00:04:40,119
You're cheating us, thief.
-If you do not stop I'll hit you.

22
00:04:40,247 -> 00:04:45,082
Give him no money, Grandma.
Your grandmother-friendly.

23
00:04:45,207 -> 00:04:49,678
No, there is no space.
Go and sit in the back.

24
00:04:49,807 -> 00:04:54,278
Your grandmother is very friendly.
She is very generous.

25
00:04:54,407 -> 00:04:55,806
Deceiver.

26
00:04:55,927 -> 00:04:59,317
Rebuke me out,
I need the money now but al

27
00:05:00,727 -> 00:05:02,126
Deceiver.

28
00:05:36,207 -> 00:05:39,199
Son of Babylon

29
00:06:11,327 -> 00:06:13,841
Give me a break.

30
00:06:13,967 -> 00:06:18,882
I'm getting a headache from hell.
Stop whistling.

31
00:06:19,007 -> 00:06:20,599
It is the flute of my father.

32
00:06:20,727 -> 00:06:26,165
I do not care.
Play something fun, like Michael Jackson.

33
00:06:26,287 -> 00:06:29,165
Who?
-Michael Jackson.

34
00:06:29,287 -> 00:06:34,486
Is that the mayor of your city?
-No, he's not my mayor.

35
00:06:34,607 -> 00:06:36,677
He is the mayor of America.

36
00:06:36,807 -> 00:06:41,039
What?
America.

37
00:06:41,167 -> 00:06:46,241
I care, I keep playing.
-If you only dims.

38
00:07:02,087 -> 00:07:04,601
Dad.

39
00:07:05,967 -> 00:07:08,322
Daddy, where are you?

40
00:07:08,447 -> 00:07:13,396
The echo sounds better in this tunnel
then the flute.

41
00:07:13,527 -> 00:07:17,315
Dad.

42
00:07:18,447 -> 00:07:22,645
What are you doing?
You're wasting your time.

43
00:07:24,887 -> 00:07:27,003
I get him not to talk.

44
00:07:35,447 -> 00:07:37,358
Want a cigarette?

45
00:07:55,047 -> 00:07:59,359
Where is your mother?
-She is dead.

46
00:07:59,487 -> 00:08:05,676
And your father?
-We go to him in Nasiriyah.

47
00:08:05,807 -> 00:08:08,924
He is brave.
He saved the life of his friend.

48
00:08:09,047 -> 00:08:12,164
Brave you say?

49
00:08:12,287 -> 00:08:16,121
Grandma promised that we go
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon go.

50
00:08:16,247 -> 00:08:19,683
What? Babylon?
-The hanging gardens of Babylon.

51
00:08:19,807 -> 00:08:24,358
Which gardens?
-Did you not in school history?

52
00:08:24,487 -> 00:08:29,561
I do not care where you go
is. Hanging gardens, whatever.

53
00:08:29,687 -> 00:08:32,884
I gotta pee.
I'm going to call Saddam.

54
00:08:33,007 -> 00:08:34,406
What?

55
00:08:38,527 -> 00:08:41,837
Hello?
How are you, Mr. Saddam?

56
00:08:41,967 -> 00:08:43,366
Bastard you are.

57
00:08:43,487 -> 00:08:47,719
Look grandma, he calls Saddam.
-Bean comes to what you deserve.

58
00:08:47,847 -> 00:08:50,919
You can on my back, asshole.

59
00:09:56,127 -> 00:10:01,440
Saddam was a bastard and Americans
his pigs. What happens here?

60
00:10:09,207 -> 00:10:11,880
Hello. America.
.

61
00:10:20,007 -> 00:10:21,440
What are you wearing?

62
00:10:21,567 -> 00:10:25,606
What is it?
-I told you: keep your father's jacket off.

63
00:10:25,727 -> 00:10:28,605
George, check the vehicle.

64
00:10:29,527 -> 00:10:32,644
Sir?
-Reverse.

65
00:10:34,007 -> 00:10:36,077
I am a soldier, just like dad.

66
00:10:36,207 -> 00:10:39,802
Your father was forced.
He wanted to be a musician.

67
00:10:39,927 -> 00:10:44,205
Very good. Thank you.
-We have solved.

68
00:10:44,487 -> 00:10:46,284
Bastards.

69
00:10:46,407 -> 00:10:51,276
I want you to school
a doctor or engineer.

70
00:10:52,527 -> 00:10:55,678
We have to stay overnight.

71
00:10:55,807 -> 00:11:00,642
American dogs have
probably a better life than us.

72
00:11:09,447 -> 00:11:13,679
Shame on you that your child bring a
to such a dangerous place.

73
00:11:13,807 -> 00:11:17,322
I'll wait here for 12 years.
He has his father.

74
00:11:17,447 -> 00:11:20,644
Had it not done,
it's too dangerous.

75
00:11:20,767 -> 00:11:25,921
I have no choice, I have no one
other. He must be his father.

76
00:11:27,407 -> 00:11:32,527
How do you know he's alive and not in
one of Saddam's mass graves located?

77
00:11:32,647 -> 00:11:37,038
I am his mother, I believe in God.
-What do you mean God?

78
00:11:37,167 -> 00:11:40,716
Why do you need your son
if you have God?

79
00:11:40,847 -> 00:11:45,557
Why do not you pray for
all poor people in this misery?

80
00:11:45,687 -> 00:11:49,077
That is the fault of men,
not God.

81
00:11:49,207 -> 00:11:51,846
How dare you doubt God?

82
00:11:51,967 -> 00:11:57,121
I have not seen my daughter two years.
She did not marry the man I wanted.

83
00:11:57,247 -> 00:11:59,681
I prayed to God endlessly.

84
00:11:59,807 -> 00:12:06,042
Yet I never saw her again.
Why did not she come back?

85
00:12:06,167 -> 00:12:10,160
If we lose a child,
a part of us dies.

86
00:12:14,807 -> 00:12:16,763
Maybe.
It is getting late.

87
00:12:16,887 -> 00:12:20,243
If you and the boy sleep in the car,
I sleep outside.

88
00:12:20,367 -> 00:12:24,918
Tomorrow we see what God has for us
has in store. Come on.

89
00:12:36,687 -> 00:12:39,884
Oh Kurdistan, Kurdistan D

90
00:12:40,007 -> 00:12:46,355
you're my home
nothing on earth like you

91
00:12:46,487 -> 00:12:51,322
No, nothing on earth like you

92
00:12:51,447 -> 00:12:56,157
Dear Lord, Lord

93
00:12:56,287 -> 00:13:00,075
Why torment us?

94
00:13:00,207 -> 00:13:03,563
Why torments the Kurds in Iraq?

95
00:13:03,687 -> 00:13:07,805
thousands of Arabs have suffered

96
00:13:07,927 -> 00:13:09,997
and many others

97
00:13:10,127 -> 00:13:15,281
many poor people

98
00:13:15,407 -> 00:13:21,118
being. victims of Anfal
.
and the powerless

99
00:13:21,247 -> 00:13:23,681
Oh my god, Oh my god

100
00:13:23,807 -> 00:13:26,560
Grandma, what's Anfal?

101
00:13:26,687 -> 00:13:28,200
Grandma?

102
00:13:29,207 -> 00:13:31,596
Grandma, what's Anfal?

103
00:13:31,727 -> 00:13:33,524
You know the Anfal not?

104
00:13:33,647 -> 00:13:38,516
The Anfal Campaign, Iraq
destroyed by the tyrant Saddam.

105
00:13:38,647 -> 00:13:41,605
He went to the south of Kurdistan.

106
00:13:41,727 -> 00:13:47,916
He killed Kurds and Arabs
and destroyed every village in its path.

107
00:13:48,047 -> 00:13:51,164
Everyone was killed.
.
children and the elderly.

108
00:13:51,287 -> 00:13:54,518
That was the Anfal, you understand now?

109
00:13:59,127 -> 00:14:01,595
Welcome to Baghdad

110
00:14:21,407 -> 00:14:26,401
Go ahead, you're the boss.

111
00:14:26,527 -> 00:14:30,645
Meanwhile, we
down here suffering.

112
00:15:03,727 -> 00:15:07,640
Here is the Alawi bus station.

113
00:15:07,767 -> 00:15:11,282
Get out of here,
but hurry it up.

114
00:15:17,647 -> 00:15:20,719
Madam, wait.
Wait a minute, ma'am.

115
00:15:23,007 -> 00:15:25,919
Here, it is yours.

116
00:15:26,047 -> 00:15:29,756
Take it.
I hope you find your son.

117
00:15:30,167 -> 00:15:32,044
Goodbye.

118
00:15:33,207 -> 00:15:35,675
Come here.
Grab it, boy.

119
00:15:35,807 -> 00:15:38,844
Care for your grandmother
and beware of dogs and wolves.

120
00:15:38,967 -> 00:15:41,401
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

121
00:15:43,087 -> 00:15:46,079
Goodbye, Uncle.

122
00:16:28,847 -> 00:16:33,602
Grandma, there's no bus.
-See that guy with the cart?

123
00:16:33,727 -> 00:16:39,438
Ask if there are buses to Nasiriyah.
-Why do not you Arabic?

124
00:16:39,567 -> 00:16:41,398
Learn yet another Arab.

125
00:17:11,407 -> 00:17:17,164
What did he say?
-That my Arabic is good.

126
00:17:17,287 -> 00:17:19,164
Ahmed.

127
00:17:19,287 -> 00:17:25,078
He said there was no bus goes to
Nasiriyah. We have to wait.

128
00:17:33,967 -> 00:17:37,198
Cigarette.

129
00:18:12,527 -> 00:18:14,802
Grandma, I'm hungry.

130
00:18:30,327 -> 00:18:34,320
Should I read it again?
I've already read 100 times.

131
00:18:39,207 -> 00:18:42,199
I'm tired of reading it again.

132
00:18:54,007 -> 00:18:59,286
In the name of God,
My name is Ali Youssef.

133
00:18:59,407 -> 00:19:03,685
I knew your son Ibrahim
In the Gulf War in 1991.

134
00:19:03,807 -> 00:19:10,076
Our unit was attacked
by Americans and the coalition.

135
00:19:10,207 -> 00:19:13,279
I wanted to write earlier.

136
00:19:13,407 -> 00:19:19,004
I'm sorry, but your son Ibrahim
was arrested by the Ba'ath Party.

137
00:19:19,127 -> 00:19:21,846
They took him to jail ...

138
00:19:27,967 -> 00:19:31,403
The prison in Nasiriyah.

139
00:19:42,247 -> 00:19:48,686
Give me my money.
Fair is fair.

140
00:19:49,687 -> 00:19:53,236
Give it. It's only 50 dinars,
I will not beg.

141
00:19:53,367 -> 00:19:56,245
Give me my money.

142
00:19:58,087 -> 00:20:04,640
Five cigarettes for 250 dinars.
It's war, but I just keep opening.

143
00:20:07,847 -> 00:20:10,407
Nasiriyah.

144
00:20:10,527 -> 00:20:12,324
The prison in Nasiriyah.

145
00:20:12,447 -> 00:20:16,360
Where is Ahmad? Where is he?
Pardon me.

146
00:20:16,487 -> 00:20:20,526
Have you seen my grandson?
-I do not speak Kurdish.

147
00:20:20,647 -> 00:20:22,046
My boy?

148
00:20:24,327 -> 00:20:28,639
What is it?
-Do you have a kid with big eyes?

149
00:20:28,767 -> 00:20:33,477
I've been waiting two days on this bus.
-My God, have you seen him?

150
00:20:33,607 -> 00:20:36,121
Would you money?
-I am not a beggar.

151
00:20:36,247 -> 00:20:37,680
I do not understand you.

152
00:20:51,367 -> 00:20:56,316
I am looking for my little boy.
-Sorry, we do not speak Kurdish.

153
00:20:56,447 -> 00:21:01,521
We do not understand.
Help me, what happened to Ahmed?

154
00:21:01,647 -> 00:21:05,845
Has anyone seen my little boy?

155
00:21:05,967 -> 00:21:09,676
He's gone. Ahmed, my child.
What happened to him?

156
00:21:10,807 -> 00:21:14,959
Five cigarettes for 250 dinars.
Here are five.

157
00:21:15,087 -> 00:21:18,841
What are you doing? I told
that you can not run away.

158
00:21:22,327 -> 00:21:25,763
Qasim, but it's my grandmother.
Take the cigarettes.

159
00:21:25,887 -> 00:21:30,165
Qasim? Who is that?
-You always want to help people.

160
00:21:41,287 -> 00:21:42,720
Thank you.

161
00:21:44,487 -> 00:21:46,921
Take the bag.

162
00:21:51,127 -> 00:21:53,482
Stop, there's no room.

163
00:21:55,807 -> 00:21:57,286
Granny.

164
00:21:59,647 -> 00:22:03,276
Grandma, come back.
-Do not be afraid.

165
00:22:04,447 -> 00:22:08,725
Grandma, do not leave me alone.

166
00:22:10,367 -> 00:22:14,724
Getting the money for bus tickets to.
-Do something about that boy.

167
00:22:14,847 -> 00:22:18,920
What's his problem?
-Driver, stop.

168
00:22:19,047 -> 00:22:21,083
Sit down and shut up.

169
00:22:30,087 -> 00:22:31,486
Stop.

170
00:22:32,687 -> 00:22:34,120
Open the door.

171
00:22:35,167 -> 00:22:39,479
Sir, his grandmother's here.
Ahmed, your grandma is there.

172
00:22:39,607 -> 00:22:43,122
Stop, his grandmother's here.
-What are you doing here?

173
00:22:43,247 -> 00:22:47,525
This old woman runs after
the bus. Why does not it?

174
00:22:47,647 -> 00:22:52,277
What old woman?
I drove almost flat.

175
00:22:57,327 -> 00:23:03,721
Grandma, let me never be alone.
-Thank God.

176
00:23:07,807 -> 00:23:12,403
I do not speak Kurdish.
Hear this dwarf are you?

177
00:23:12,527 -> 00:23:15,041
I'm not with her.
Step-off.

178
00:23:20,287 -> 00:23:22,596
Boarding, we are in a hurry.

179
00:23:26,007 -> 00:23:28,919
How dare you leave me to take him?

180
00:23:33,687 -> 00:23:36,076
Goodbye, Qasim.

181
00:23:37,327 -> 00:23:40,876
Ahmed, come back to Baghdad.

182
00:24:04,607 -> 00:24:09,761
When people hurt us,
we must forgive them.

183
00:24:09,887 -> 00:24:13,721
Your father would be proud,
as well as you take care of me.

184
00:24:15,127 -> 00:24:17,846
I will tell him how you stuck ...

185
00:24:19,647 -> 00:24:21,763
with your buttocks in the window.

186
00:24:23,087 -> 00:24:24,486
What about you?

187
00:24:24,607 -> 00:24:31,479
I tell him how you behind the bus
you run like a headless chicken.

188
00:24:31,607 -> 00:24:34,246
Ahmed. Ahmed.
.

189
00:25:31,247 -> 00:25:33,203
Nasiriyah 40 km

190
00:25:36,367 -> 00:25:38,198
The road is off.

191
00:26:24,407 -> 00:26:27,240
Go to sleep, everybody,
It's safe.

192
00:26:27,367 -> 00:26:29,562
Honey, why do not you sleep?

193
00:26:31,087 -> 00:26:34,602
Grandma, I'm afraid.
-What are you afraid of?

194
00:26:35,607 -> 00:26:39,202
To die.
-We do not die, sweetheart.

195
00:26:39,327 -> 00:26:44,606
We continue to live forever.
-No one lives forever.

196
00:26:44,727 -> 00:26:47,480
I'll tell you a story.

197
00:26:47,607 -> 00:26:51,156
There was once ...

198
00:26:52,687 -> 00:26:57,238
an ancient prophet
many of whom God loved.

199
00:26:57,367 -> 00:26:59,403
He asked God for a gift.

200
00:26:59,527 -> 00:27:05,841
God blessed him with a son,
on whom he loved.

201
00:27:05,967 -> 00:27:10,563
One day, God said
The prophet had to sacrifice his son.

202
00:27:10,687 -> 00:27:15,522
He said: "Son, I have to sacrifice,
in the name of God. "

203
00:27:15,647 -> 00:27:22,519
The son said: "Do me a blindfold.
Then you see my eyes. "

204
00:27:22,647 -> 00:27:28,279
He was blindfolded and put the
a knife against the throat of his son.

205
00:27:28,407 -> 00:27:32,241
Then suddenly a ram down
from heaven.

206
00:27:32,367 -> 00:27:37,566
And a voice whispered to the Prophet:

207
00:27:37,687 -> 00:27:44,399
"Sacrifice the ram instead of your son."
The prophet obeyed God.

208
00:27:44,527 -> 00:27:47,758
And the prophet lived forever in us.

209
00:28:20,367 -> 00:28:22,756
Sir, I go to the toilet.

210
00:28:22,967 -> 00:28:25,401
What?
-I'm going to call Saddam.

211
00:28:25,527 -> 00:28:30,601
I have no time for Saddam.
I have enough problems.

212
00:28:30,727 -> 00:28:33,685
Mr. Hassan, to give me the wrench.

213
00:30:09,567 -> 00:30:12,525
the house of Prophet Ibrahim

214
00:30:17,127 -> 00:30:19,721
Granny.

215
00:30:19,847 -> 00:30:23,840
Ibrahim.
-Your father?

216
00:30:23,967 -> 00:30:29,041
Not Dad, the Prophet Ibrahim.
-Okay, okay.

217
00:30:36,847 -> 00:30:40,078
Here we are. All trips.

218
00:30:40,207 -> 00:30:43,677
Take us to jail.
-The fuel is.

219
00:30:43,807 -> 00:30:45,206
Ahmed, we are going.

220
00:30:45,367 -> 00:30:49,838
I'm not going to Nasiriyah,
it is not safe,

221
00:30:49,967 -> 00:30:53,562
[Come on, get off the bus.

222
00:30:54,887 -> 00:31:01,520
Where is the prison of Nasiriyah?
-I do not understand you. Now get out.

223
00:31:20,487 -> 00:31:22,603
Ahmed.

224
00:31:37,487 -> 00:31:41,639
It hurts. I'm so sleepy.
-Wake up.

225
00:31:41,767 -> 00:31:45,203
We need to jail.
Everyone is gone.

226
00:31:45,327 -> 00:31:48,399
How do I know where it is?

227
00:31:48,527 -> 00:31:52,805
People talked about it in the bus.
We must follow them.

228
00:31:52,927 -> 00:31:55,725
Well, I'm going first.
Follow me.

229
00:32:01,447 -> 00:32:03,278
Look there.

230
00:32:20,247 -> 00:32:21,999
Dirty Ba'athists.

231
00:32:31,047 -> 00:32:32,924
Ahmed.

232
00:32:36,247 -> 00:32:39,842
Do not be scared.
Stay close.

233
00:33:01,087 -> 00:33:02,884
Where are we?

234
00:33:03,887 -> 00:33:09,803
Grandma, I think we're lost.
-Not true.

235
00:33:09,927 -> 00:33:16,446
Granny. I do not like it here.
.
I'm scared and I'm hungry.

236
00:33:16,567 -> 00:33:19,365
Why are you afraid?
-I am very scared, Grandma.

237
00:33:19,487 -> 00:33:21,842
Do not worry, sweetheart.

238
00:33:23,207 -> 00:33:25,675
See that tall building over there?

239
00:33:25,807 -> 00:33:30,278
Go up there, you can see
where people go.

240
00:33:30,407 -> 00:33:32,796
I follow you.

241
00:33:33,927 -> 00:33:38,159
No, I'm afraid.
-Honey, do not be afraid. Go.

242
00:34:16,247 -> 00:34:18,044
Police?

243
00:34:22,247 -> 00:34:24,477
Police?

244
00:34:32,607 -> 00:34:34,723
Hello.

245
00:34:39,367 -> 00:34:41,927
Is there anyone?

246
00:35:02,367 -> 00:35:04,403
Granny.

247
00:35:25,007 -> 00:35:30,365
Grandma, I see them.
They go that way.

248
00:35:45,647 -> 00:35:47,399
Ahmed.

249
00:35:48,487 -> 00:35:51,923
Do not you see?
They are there.

250
00:35:53,567 -> 00:35:58,516
Grandma, the prison is there.
Everyone goes there.

251
00:35:58,647 -> 00:36:02,037
I do not want you see your father
if you're so dirty.

252
00:36:24,367 -> 00:36:27,484
The water is too cold.

253
00:37:12,327 -> 00:37:13,726
You like it?

254
00:37:14,727 -> 00:37:17,605
Yes. Granny.
.
-It suits you.

255
00:37:17,727 -> 00:37:19,524
Grandma, you're wonderful.

256
00:38:09,207 -> 00:38:10,925
What is it?

257
00:38:13,487 -> 00:38:17,321
Grandma, please.
Let's go inside.

258
00:38:32,447 -> 00:38:36,520
To find missing relatives
to the information desk.

Good day, sir.
-Good day.

267
00:39:33,087 -> 00:39:37,399
We are looking for my father, Ibrahim.

268

Search on your list
to Ibrahim Khalil Sharhoh.

270
00:39:52,607 -> 00:39:55,758
He is not on the list.
-Check again.

271
00:39:55,887 -> 00:39:58,640
What does he do?

272
00:39:58,767 -> 00:40:02,680
A new mass grave.
Try it again.

273

You're lying.
Liar.

What is he saying?
-You have also lied.

275
00:40:08,207 -> 00:40:10,596
What did he say?
Ahmed?

276
00:40:11,967 -> 00:40:14,322
Dad.

277
00:40:14,447 -> 00:40:20,477
Daddy, where are you?
I have not seen you for twelve years.

278
00:40:21,487 -> 00:40:23,876
Dad.

279
00:40:25,807 -> 00:40:27,957
Daddy, where are you?

280
00:40:33,087 -> 00:40:35,760
Where are you?

281
00:41:07,007 -> 00:41:10,079
Ibrahim.
Where are you, my son?

282

your wife has been waiting for you.

284
00:41:20,727 -> 00:41:24,037
Ibrahim, were you here?

285
00:41:25,607 -> 00:41:29,805
Your son grew up.

286
00:41:58,727 -> 00:42:00,479
Your father was here.

287
00:43:04,287 -> 00:43:05,879

Sit down here.

289

You all right, ma'am? Are you okay?
-Yes.

290
00:43:42,487 -> 00:43:44,921
Do you understand me?

291
00:43:45,047 -> 00:43:50,883
Do you speak Arabic?
You do. Nice.

292
00:45:01,327 -> 00:45:04,717
Can you whistle?

293
00:45:07,567 -> 00:45:09,398
It's a beautiful flute.

294
00:45:13,567 -> 00:45:15,637
He is my father.

295
00:45:17,087 -> 00:45:22,480
According to Grandma, I can be a musician
if I'm as good as my father.

296
00:45:22,607 -> 00:45:24,484
Is your dad a musician?

297
00:45:32,807 -> 00:45:37,835
I'll give you an orange,
which are good for you as you travel.

298
00:45:39,047 -> 00:45:44,167
Where are they now? Here's one.
Fortunately, I have some left.

299
00:45:46,807 -> 00:45:48,638
Grab it.

300
00:45:48,767 -> 00:45:51,201
One for you and one for your grandma.

301
00:46:03,927 -> 00:46:06,202
Whistle is your hobby?

302
00:46:07,207 -> 00:46:11,041
My hobby is smoking.
-Look at me, look at me.

303
00:46:11,167 -> 00:46:13,283
I'll show you.

304
00:46:19,167 -> 00:46:22,443
Would you like to see it again?

305
00:46:22,567 -> 00:46:24,876
Let's see.

306
00:46:30,327 -> 00:46:33,160
I can not, there is too much wind.

307
00:46:40,327 -> 00:46:43,319
You have to get out.
-Try to make.

308
00:46:43,447 -> 00:46:45,881
Baghdad is still far away.

309
00:46:46,007 -> 00:46:50,364
The driver said the bus is broken.

310
00:46:50,487 -> 00:46:55,880
Come on, people get off.
-Where are we now?

311
00:46:56,007 -> 00:47:00,797
Madam, the bus is broken.
We have to look.

312
00:47:04,167 -> 00:47:05,646
Come on, lady.

313
00:47:10,927 -> 00:47:14,158
Come on.

314
00:47:19,887 -> 00:47:22,879
Hurry up.

315
00:47:27,447 -> 00:47:28,846
What do you want?

316
00:47:28,967 -> 00:47:31,845
Give our money back.
-What do you mean?

317
00:47:31,967 -> 00:47:35,676
You're cheating us.
You have brought us to Baghdad.

318
00:47:35,807 -> 00:47:40,597
Do you think only of money?
-Give it back, honest.

319
00:47:40,727 -> 00:47:43,287
My goodness.

320
00:47:45,927 -> 00:47:51,797
For two people, grandma and me.
-You think only of money. Here.

321
00:47:51,927 -> 00:47:56,045
Actually, for three people.
-My God.

322
00:48:00,127 -> 00:48:02,197
Give our money back.

323
00:48:19,607 -> 00:48:21,563
Welcome to Babylon

324
00:48:21,687 -> 00:48:26,124
I like to wear my father's legerjas.
I want a soldier.

325
00:48:26,247 -> 00:48:30,240
Really?
Why do you want to be a soldier?

326
00:48:30,367 -> 00:48:33,882
Because I'm strong.
-I am stronger.

327
00:48:34,007 -> 00:48:39,161
I'll show you how soldiers run
in the army. One, two, three ...

328
00:48:46,327 -> 00:48:48,602
You have a lovely grandson.

329
00:48:48,727 -> 00:48:51,605
I'm worried,
He wants to be a soldier.

330
00:48:51,727 -> 00:48:58,121
As he gets older, he forgets that.
Kurdish-Where did you learn?

331
00:48:58,247 -> 00:49:01,284
When I was 18.

332
00:49:01,407 -> 00:49:05,923
I was forced Ba'athists
to work in the north.

333
00:49:06,047 -> 00:49:08,038
What kind of work?

334
00:49:10,767 -> 00:49:13,156
What kind of work?

335
00:49:15,127 -> 00:49:16,879
I was forced.

336
00:49:19,727 -> 00:49:24,403
I had to attack villages.
I've killed.

337
00:49:24,527 -> 00:49:27,883
Women and children.
-You heard in the Anfal.

338
00:49:28,007 -> 00:49:29,406
No.

339
00:49:30,847 -> 00:49:35,841
It was under duress. I was just two
months the Republican Guard.

340
00:49:35,967 -> 00:49:41,599
If I would run away I was killed.
-If only you were murdered, murderer.

341
00:49:41,727 -> 00:49:46,243
Do not say anything, murderer.
Stays away from me.

342
00:49:46,367 -> 00:49:51,725
Go away, murderer.
You killed my family.

343
00:49:51,847 -> 00:49:55,635
Please. Listen ...
.
'You're a murderer.

344
00:49:55,767 -> 00:50:00,682
You're as bad as Saddam.
-Enough.

345
00:50:00,807 -> 00:50:03,765
Enough.
-Get out, killer.

346
00:50:03,887 -> 00:50:10,486
Ibrahim, where are you? Come help us.
He is a murderer.

347
00:50:10,607 -> 00:50:12,245
I'm al

348
00:50:16,607 -> 00:50:18,199
Get out, killer.

349
00:50:18,327 -> 00:50:22,206
How do you know?
-He is a murderer.

350
00:51:41,767 -> 00:51:43,166
Let me help you.

351
00:52:18,847 -> 00:52:20,246
Ibrahim.

352
00:52:26,607 -> 00:52:29,440
Where is Ahmad?

353
00:52:35,487 -> 00:52:37,045
Where is he?

354
00:52:40,807 -> 00:52:43,037
And so you put it out.

355
00:52:47,007 -> 00:52:50,079
Grandma, what is it?
-Come here.

356
00:52:55,727 -> 00:53:00,005
What is the problem, grandma?
Musa is a nice man.

357
00:53:00,127 -> 00:53:02,846
Why do you want it to go away?

358
00:53:06,207 -> 00:53:10,041
Grandmother of Ibrahim, I can
not just leave.

359
00:53:10,167 -> 00:53:13,523
There is a prisoner
brought to the mosque.

360
00:53:13,647 -> 00:53:16,878
Listen, he's in the mosque nearby.

361
00:53:27,967 -> 00:53:32,677
Musa, tell Grandma ...
-Ahmed, come here.

362
00:53:35,767 -> 00:53:39,396
Grandma, do you remember what I
told the bus?

363
00:53:39,527 -> 00:53:44,317
You said that when people hurt us,
We must forgive them.

364
00:53:44,447 -> 00:53:47,200
Walk for me.
-Good.

365
00:54:33,087 -> 00:54:35,317
Hello, Sheik.
-Hi.

366
00:54:36,807 -> 00:54:40,686
How are you?
-Good. It's nice to see you.

367
00:54:40,807 -> 00:54:44,641
How are you?
-She asks how you are doing.

368
00:54:44,767 -> 00:54:47,600
Sheik, I need your help.
First-Come inside.

369
00:54:47,727 -> 00:54:52,926
Thanks, but we are in a hurry.
This woman is from the north.

370
00:54:53,047 -> 00:54:55,322
Her son has been missing since 1991.

371
00:54:55,447 -> 00:54:59,076
I heard that a prisoner
here has been taken.

372
00:54:59,207 -> 00:55:01,516
She wants to see if her son.

373
00:55:01,647 -> 00:55:07,517
From whom did you hear that?
-A few good people, you know.

374
00:55:07,647 -> 00:55:14,200
Musa, he was severely wounded.
He is sick and unrecognizable.

375
00:55:14,327 -> 00:55:20,846
He's practically dead.
-We hope you he is her son.

376
00:55:20,967 -> 00:55:23,037
Ahmed, what does he do?

377
00:55:23,167 -> 00:55:28,161
The man in the mosque was badly injured.
He is unrecognizable.

378
00:55:28,287 -> 00:55:32,917
You may not see him.
-Sheikh, please.

379
00:55:33,967 -> 00:55:36,879
You know how mothers
to give their child.

380
00:55:37,007 -> 00:55:41,956
I am looking for him for twelve years.
She begs you-

381
00:55:42,087 -> 00:55:48,925
I looked everywhere. In Baghdad
and Nasiriyah. And now in Babylon.

382
00:55:49,047 -> 00:55:54,804
I hope I can find it here.
Please, may God bless you.

383
00:55:54,927 -> 00:55:57,566
How much longer must I endure?

384
00:55:57,687 -> 00:56:01,362
I counted down the days and months
to this day.

385
00:56:01,487 -> 00:56:06,003
Please, I beg you
-Do not do that.

386
00:56:06,127 -> 00:56:11,997
They want him just to see. Please
help her, she has no one else.

387
00:56:13,087 -> 00:56:14,566
Follow me.

388
00:56:22,927 -> 00:56:29,241
Honey, stay here.
I'll see if it is your father.

389
00:56:29,367 -> 00:56:35,317
But it's also my dad.
-I'll stay with him. Come on.

390
00:56:44,607 -> 00:56:47,440
Peace be with you

391
00:56:49,247 -> 00:56:50,965
Come in, madam.

392
00:57:03,807 -> 00:57:05,525
Madam, come.

393
00:57:31,687 -> 00:57:33,678
Would you play your flute?

394
00:57:53,967 -> 00:57:57,118
Will you teach me whistle?

395
00:57:59,207 -> 00:58:03,803
I could be all,
but you're a little better.

396
00:58:03,927 -> 00:58:06,680
A little?
I learn nothing.

397
00:58:06,807 -> 00:58:08,923
You're the best course.

398
00:58:09,047 -> 00:58:13,484
This is a great place to learn.
Besides ru.ines of Nimrod.

399
00:58:13,607 -> 00:58:18,203
What do you think?
-Good. The first lesson is up.

400
00:58:18,327 -> 00:58:20,397
Stand up?
-Listen to the teacher.

401
00:58:20,527 -> 00:58:22,199
Of course.

402
00:58:23,207 -> 00:58:24,879
I am.

403
00:58:25,007 -> 00:58:28,556
You're too long, now I get up.

404
00:58:33,847 -> 00:58:38,284
Second lesson, keep your back straight.

405
00:58:38,407 -> 00:58:41,604
So?
Okay, succeeded.

406
00:58:43,087 -> 00:58:45,203
Your mouth.
-My mouth?

407
00:59:12,287 -> 00:59:14,084
It's all right, Grandma.

408
00:59:15,167 -> 00:59:17,203
Let's go home.

409
00:59:18,287 -> 00:59:22,326
Thanks for your time.
-No problem, where are you going?

410
00:59:22,447 -> 00:59:25,166
No idea,
perhaps to the bus station.

411
00:59:25,287 -> 00:59:28,643
Why do not you
at the mass graves?

412
00:59:28,767 -> 00:59:30,644
Musa, we're going home.

413
00:59:32,567 -> 00:59:36,003
I take them first to the bus station.
Goodbye.

414
00:59:36,127 -> 00:59:40,040
Goodbye.
-God be with you

415
00:59:50,807 -> 00:59:56,200
Musa, where the hanging gardens?
Here-nearby.

416
00:59:56,327 -> 01:00:00,002
How do they look?
-When stacked platforms.

417
01:00:00,127 -> 01:00:04,359
There were no pumps
to carry water to the top.

418
01:00:04,487 -> 01:00:10,562
So she lifted it up yourself.
-You know the story behind the gardens?

419
01:00:10,687 -> 01:00:12,359
Tell.

420
01:00:12,487 -> 01:00:17,242
There once was a king
who married a queen.

421
01:00:17,367 -> 01:00:20,086
She had mountains
and green fields used.

422
01:00:20,207 -> 01:00:25,918
She was bored in the desert.
You know what the king did?

423
01:00:26,047 -> 01:00:29,676
He built the gardens.
Because he loved her.

424
01:00:29,807 -> 01:00:33,561
That's right. If we have time
we can seek.

425
01:00:33,687 -> 01:00:36,838
Grandma has promised that we go there.

426
01:00:36,967 -> 01:00:40,198
If we are in the neighborhood,
I bring you there.

427
01:00:55,527 -> 01:00:57,199
Who are they?

428
01:00:59,447 -> 01:01:01,039
Turn it to one side.

429
01:01:08,207 -> 01:01:09,606
What are they?

430
01:01:09,727 -> 01:01:14,847
Bodies from mass graves
recently found.

431
01:01:14,967 -> 01:01:17,003
Victims of 1991.

432
01:03:01,967 -> 01:03:03,798
Grandma, what is it?

433
01:03:13,367 -> 01:03:16,996
We need him to take home.

434
01:03:17,527 -> 01:03:19,802
What do you mean?

435
01:03:20,807 -> 01:03:22,923
We will not go home?

436
01:04:04,487 -> 01:04:07,957
Ahmed, stay here.

437
01:04:08,087 -> 01:04:11,636
Stay away from the graves.
Razzak, watch him.

438
01:04:56,927 -> 01:05:03,036
How can I help my grandma?
She's sick.

439
01:05:04,207 -> 01:05:06,277
I do not know what to do.

440
01:05:15,967 -> 01:05:18,037
Can you whistle?

441
01:05:19,687 -> 01:05:21,086
Well?

442
01:05:21,207 -> 01:05:23,767
Ibrahim Khalil Sharhoh?
-Not here.

443
01:05:23,887 -> 01:05:26,447
There are more graves in Al-Mahawil.

444
01:05:26,567 -> 01:05:28,683
Is not he here?
-No.

445
01:05:28,807 -> 01:05:32,766
Are you sure? Thank you.
-God be with you.

446
01:05:32,887 -> 01:05:36,516
His name is Ibrahim Khalil Sharhoh.
-He is not here.

447
01:05:41,887 -> 01:05:46,915
You always say that he is not there.
I want to ask yourself.

448
01:05:47,047 -> 01:05:48,526
Go sit there.

449
01:06:12,167 -> 01:06:14,044
What has become of us?

450
01:06:17,047 -> 01:06:19,845
I can not understand what you say?

451
01:06:21,167 -> 01:06:25,160
We were only married for one year
when they took him.

452
01:06:25,287 -> 01:06:28,643
Ahmed grew up without a father.

453
01:06:28,767 -> 01:06:33,079
Fatima stayed behind. She is now 12
and asks him daily.

454
01:06:33,207 -> 01:06:39,555
I have searched in prisons,
and now I search among the graves.

455
01:06:39,687 -> 01:06:42,918
And I can not find him.

456
01:06:43,047 -> 01:06:44,799
Hello.

457
01:06:46,607 -> 01:06:48,006
Of water.

458
01:06:49,367 -> 01:06:51,119
Sir?
-Yes?

459
01:06:51,247 -> 01:06:54,478
I do not speak Kurdish,
but I feel her pain.

460
01:06:54,607 -> 01:06:58,236
Have you talked?
Her son is missing.

461
01:06:59,247 -> 01:07:02,717
Grandma Ibrahim, come we go.

462
01:07:02,847 -> 01:07:05,725
I help her.
-Thank you.

463
01:07:21,007 -> 01:07:26,445
Granny. do not cry.
.
I'll help you to find dad.

464
01:07:26,567 -> 01:07:29,798
This is her grandson Ahmad.

465
01:07:36,087 -> 01:07:42,117
No, it's good. We already have an elevator.
Do not worry, ma'am.

466
01:07:42,247 -> 01:07:48,322
Thank you. Razzak waiting.
Come on, he waits.

467
01:07:56,967 -> 01:07:58,366
Stop.

468
01:08:04,007 -> 01:08:10,924
Ahmed, what is it?
-Musa, I go along with my grandmother.

469
01:08:11,047 -> 01:08:13,607
Yes, come.
-No, Musa.

470
01:08:13,727 -> 01:08:18,164
I just have to take my grandmother.
-Why?

471
01:08:18,287 -> 01:08:23,759
Musa, you can not join us.
You need to go home.

472
01:08:23,887 -> 01:08:27,323
Why, Ahmed?
-Musa, my dear.

473
01:08:27,487 -> 01:08:34,484
My son was forced to soldier
be. And so it happened.

474
01:08:34,607 -> 01:08:39,078
Thanks for your help.
I forgive you.

475
01:08:39,207 -> 01:08:45,077
I want to continue helping.
-You so much for us.

476
01:08:46,127 -> 01:08:48,516
I forgive you.

477
01:08:51,927 -> 01:08:55,283
Ahmed.
-God be with you.

478
01:08:59,927 -> 01:09:03,124
Pay attention to your grandmother.

479
01:09:03,247 -> 01:09:07,763
Go back to the mosque
if you're in trouble.

480
01:09:07,887 -> 01:09:11,277
The Sheikh will take you to my house.
Good?

481
01:09:12,287 -> 01:09:14,403
Goodbye, Musa.

482
01:09:42,927 -> 01:09:44,804
Goodbye, Musa.

483
01:09:47,567 -> 01:09:48,966
Ahmed.



484
01:09:50,567 -> 01:09:53,764
I want to bring to Babylon.

485
01:09:53,887 -> 01:09:56,640
The hanging gardens.

486
01:11:16,047 -> 01:11:20,677
Oh brother wounded, injured brother

487
01:11:20,807 -> 01:11:24,595
stand up so I can take care of your wounds

488
01:11:24,727 -> 01:11:29,357
Babylon and Aur miss you

489
01:11:29,487 -> 01:11:34,925
even the birds cry for you

490
01:11:35,047 -> 01:11:39,279
Oh Mother, we seek
to our lost loved ones

491
01:11:39,407 -> 01:11:44,481
our lost loved ones

492
01:11:46,647 -> 01:11:52,358
we sleep and stay in Babylon

493
01:11:52,487 -> 01:11:55,559
we sleep and stay

494
01:12:00,367 -> 01:12:06,442
the loss of our sons
feels like the loss of our soul

495
01:12:11,007 -> 01:12:17,606
we want to see them walking
with the other boys

496
01:12:17,727 -> 01:12:23,836
They wear their coats
over their shoulders

497
01:12:24,447 -> 01:12:28,042
Grandma, I do not want to be a soldier.

498
01:12:28,167 -> 01:12:31,603
I want to be a musician, just like dad.

499
01:16:27,807 -> 01:16:30,605
Grandma?

500
01:16:31,647 -> 01:16:34,798
I'm going to ask this man.

501
01:16:49,087 -> 01:16:54,559
Ibrahim.
My son, where are you?

502
01:16:56,127 -> 01:16:59,642
He is not here.
Most bodies are unknown.

503
01:16:59,767 -> 01:17:04,318
We can not identify.
There are new graves.

504
01:17:04,447 -> 01:17:07,325
See if he is there.
Wait a minute.

505
01:17:19,007 -> 01:17:23,285
O my son, I miss you so.

506
01:17:26,287 -> 01:17:31,520
I've looked for you everywhere.

507
01:17:44,487 -> 01:17:47,365
The man said he is not here.

508
01:17:47,487 -> 01:17:51,958
There is another mass grave found
where to look.

509
01:17:52,087 -> 01:17:54,237
Grandma, please.

510
01:17:55,487 -> 01:17:58,320
Please, Grandma.

511
01:18:03,527 -> 01:18:07,361
Grandma, look.
His name is Omar.

512
01:18:13,687 -> 01:18:15,723
This is called Salem.

513
01:18:25,247 -> 01:18:27,442
Grandma, this is called Jawad.

514
01:18:33,207 -> 01:18:36,722
Grandma, it is unclear,
There is no name.

515
01:18:36,847 -> 01:18:39,315
Oh my god.

516
01:18:39,447 -> 01:18:41,597
Stop crying, please.

517
01:18:51,887 -> 01:18:56,199
Please grandma.
That's enough.

518
01:18:56,327 -> 01:19:00,161
Stop, I beg you.

519
01:19:00,287 -> 01:19:03,836
Ibrahim, my dear son.

520
01:19:17,327 -> 01:19:19,841
Stop it.
Let's go, please.

521
01:19:26,847 -> 01:19:28,758
Ibrahim.

522
01:19:32,767 -> 01:19:36,555
What is it, grandma?
I'm not Ibrahim.

523
01:19:36,687 -> 01:19:38,962
When Ibrahim was a baby ...

524
01:19:41,647 -> 01:19:43,444
When he was a baby ...

525
01:20:15,247 -> 01:20:20,196
Where are we?
-The ru.ï.nes of Babylon.

526
01:20:31,807 -> 01:20:33,763
Granny.

527
01:21:04,887 -> 01:21:08,277
Do not let me down.

528
01:21:09,367 -> 01:21:12,439
Grandma, we are in Babylon.

529
01:22:18,727 -> 01:22:23,721
In the last 40 years, more than
one million people missing in Iraq

530
01:22:25,247 -> 01:22:30,605
In 2009 a total of 300 mass graves
found with about 250,000 bodies

531
01:22:32,167 -> 01:22:36,524
The majority is still
missing or not ge.ï.dentificeerd

532
01:22:45,247 -> 01:22:48,045
