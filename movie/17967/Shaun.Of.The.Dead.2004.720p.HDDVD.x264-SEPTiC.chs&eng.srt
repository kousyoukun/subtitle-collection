00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:51,141
Yeah.
没错

621
00:45:51,225 --> 00:45:55,396
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when...
拜,肖恩,也该是时候了...

622
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,899
you just...
你得...

623
00:45:58,983 --> 00:46:01,026
gotta be a man.
当个男子汉

624
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:10,870
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.
我告诉你,根本是大惊小怪

625
00:46:10,911 --> 00:46:12,872
Hello, Edward.
你好,艾德华

626
00:46:12,913 --> 00:46:15,457
- Hi, Barbara.
- My, how you've grown.
-你好,芭芭拉
-哇,你长这么大了

627
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:18,961
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?
你最好相信吧
怎么搞的? 他怎会跟来?

628
00:46:19,003 --> 00:46:22,673
- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?
-并不全都那么容易
-我们跟着你们走吗?

629
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:26,343
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?
不,可能最好是我们...
车子呢?

630
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:29,430
Hmm...I pranged it.
撞烂了

631
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:31,140
You were parked.
你才停个车呀

632
00:46:31,182 --> 00:46:33,017
Yeah.
对

633
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,603
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.
我猜我们得坐积架车了

634
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:39,482
- Philip?
- What?
-菲利普?
-什么事?

635
00:46:39,523 --> 00:46:41,609
Look out!
小心!

636
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,196
Christ!
老天!

637
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:56,332
- Give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.
-车钥匙给我!
-你别想开那辆车

638
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:59,585
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.
车钥匙给我!
艾德,叫妈上车

639
00:46:59,627 --> 00:47:01,879
I'm on it.
没问题

640
00:47:01,962 --> 00:47:04,882
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.
别担心我,担心你妈吧

641
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,261
- Maybe I should drive.
- I've adjusted the seat now.
-也许该由我来开
-我座位调整好了呀

642
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:11,138
Just be careful!
只要小心点!

643
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:24,735
Can you please turn that noise down?
拜把那噪音关掉好吗?

644
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,698
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?
你还好吧,亲爱的? 面纸还要吗?

645
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,202
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.
要不是那该死的噪音,我就没事

646
00:47:33,244 --> 00:47:35,454
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.
-是有点吵
-抱歉,芭芭拉

647
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:40,668
You do realise this is
a 20 mile an hour zone?
你们晓得这里限速20哩吗?

648
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:42,294
Oh, yeah.
晓得

649
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:47,842
- Here.
- Mum, this won't take a second, all right?
-到了
-妈,一下子就好,行吗?

650
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:55,558
- Have you still got the child locks on?
- Safety first, Shaun.
-你还装了幼童安全锁?
-安全第一,肖恩

651
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,685
You can't...
你不能...

652
00:47:59,103 --> 00:48:01,689
Hey, man, watch the leather.
嘿,小心皮椅

653
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:07,069
Keep moving. If there's any problems...
继续开,如果有麻烦的话...

654
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:09,446
I'll do the honks.
我会按喇叭的

655
00:48:33,554 --> 00:48:35,598
'Hello?'
喂?

656
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:40,144
Hello?
喂?

657
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:04,043
- Guys, can you let me in?
- What are you doing?
-大伙,能让我进去吗?
-你在干嘛呀?

658
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:06,879
I've come to get you.
我来接你的

659
00:49:19,016 --> 00:49:23,020
- What are you doing?
- I've come to take you somewhere safe.
-肖恩,你做什么?
-我来带你去安全的地方

660
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:25,272
- We were safe!
- You don't know that.
-我们在这儿安全的很!
-你并不清楚

661
00:49:25,356 --> 00:49:28,442
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?
之前外面才两个,现在有几个了?

662
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:29,735
- Lots.
- Lots!
-一大堆
-一大堆!

663
00:49:29,777 --> 00:49:32,738
It only takes one of them
to know you're in here.
相信我,只要他们其中一个
知道你们在这里面就完了

664
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,534
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.
我一直打电话都打不通
我只好拟定一个计划

665
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:40,079
- Oh, you made a plan?
- We have to get out of here.
-哦,你定了一个计划?
-我们必须离开这里

666
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,790
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.
如果不离开,他们会把我们分尸的

667
00:49:42,873 --> 00:49:45,709
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.
那会使我们事情恶化的

668
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:48,629
- Shaun...
- This is not about you and me.
-肖恩...
-这与你我的事无关

669
00:49:48,712 --> 00:49:50,714
This is about survival.
是生死攸关的事

670
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:54,760
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere we can stay alive.
我们需要去更安全的地方
一个可以活下去的地方

671
00:49:54,802 --> 00:49:57,054
- We're with you, Shaun.
- What?
-我们跟你走,肖恩
-什么?

672
00:49:57,137 --> 00:49:59,849
- We're with you.
- I'm not going out there.
-我们跟你走
-我才不要出去

673
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,687
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces
and if you think about it, neither do you.
大卫! 我不想被分尸
你若考虑过,你也不愿那样的

674
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:07,481
- I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
- She's going.
-如果小丽不走,我也不走
-她会走的

675
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:09,733
- I'm not staying by myself.
- You're going, aren't you?
-我不要一个人留下来
-你要走,是不是?

676
00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:11,861
- Lizzie?
- Liz?
-小丽?
-丽兹?

677
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:19,952
- All right, Flash, what's your plan?
- Great. I've got a car
-好吧,简单说说你的计划为何?
-太好了,我有辆车

678
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:23,706
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?
不过现在呢有点挤,还有人有车吗?

679
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:25,791
- Yes!
- Great. Where?
-有的!
-太好了,在哪?

680
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:28,711
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.
哦,不是! 我考到驾照了

681
00:50:28,752 --> 00:50:30,004
David?
大卫?

682
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:33,632
I don't see the point
of owning a car in London.
我觉得在伦敦买车来开没什么用

683
00:50:33,674 --> 00:50:36,427
Look, just get any blunt objects together.
听着,拿任何钝器都行

684
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,305
If you get cornered,
bash them in the head.
如果被围住,朝头部用力敲下去

685
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:42,099
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.
聚在一起,保持警觉并跟着我走

686
00:50:42,183 --> 00:50:44,560
So, what's the plan, then?
那计划到底为何?

687
00:50:44,602 --> 00:50:46,979
We're going to the Winchester.
我们要去温彻斯特

688
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:52,902
OK? Let's go.
好了吗? 我们走

689
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:11,128
- Come on.
- Where's the car?
-快点
-车子呢?

690
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:17,885
What's up, niggaz?
怎么了,混混?

691
00:51:22,556 --> 00:51:26,644
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.
很抱歉里头满挤的
小黛,坐在大卫的膝盖上

692
00:51:26,727 --> 00:51:29,772
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.
菲利普,撑着点好吗?
艾德,开快点

693
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:32,107
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.
妈,这是丽兹! 丽兹,这是妈

694
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:34,068
Hello.
你好

695
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:42,493
Ed, be careful.
艾德,小心点

696
00:51:42,576 --> 00:51:44,703
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.
-你爸没事吧?
-他不是我爸

697
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:47,248
- He's bleeding.
- I know! Ed, be careful.
-他在流血呢
-我知道! 艾德,小心开车

698
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:50,000
Thought you wanted to get there fast?
你不是说要开快点吗?

699
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:53,629
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?
我想整个人好好的到达那里!
干嘛走这条路?

700
00:51:53,671 --> 00:51:55,756
Chill out, it's a short cut.
别紧张,这是捷径

701
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,884
- That road goes to the Winchester.
- Shaun...
-那条路通往温彻斯特
-肖恩...

702
00:51:58,926 --> 00:52:03,264
- Liz, please!
- I don't understand why the Winchester?
-丽兹,麻烦一下!
-我还是不懂干嘛非要去温彻斯特?

703
00:52:03,347 --> 00:52:06,475
- It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
- They know us.
-那是个酒吧,那里安全
-他们认识我们

704
00:52:06,517 --> 00:52:10,604
- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.
-酒吧为何会安全?
-因为有厚重的大门和门闩锁

705
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:12,565
And there's a rifle above the bar.
而且酒吧上方有把莱福枪

706
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:17,278
- I would think that's deactivated.
- It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.
-我想那把枪不能击发了
-才没呢! 约翰有关连,大艾尔说的

707
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:19,446
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.
大艾尔也说狗不会辨识颜色

708
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,990
- They can't.
- Can't they?
-们不会
-会吗?

709
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:23,159
- Of course they can!
- Are you sure?
-当然会!
-你确定?

710
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,745
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.
是的! 这酒吧是最好的去处
一切会没事的,我保证

711
00:52:26,787 --> 00:52:29,248
- Shaun...
- I turned it off, all right?
-肖恩...
-已经关掉了,好吗?

712
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,500
What?
什么?

713
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:34,879
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?
-当个父亲并不容易
-什么?

714
00:52:35,462 --> 00:52:39,800
You were 12 when I met you,
you'd already grown up so much.
你碰到你时,你那时才12岁
就已经长的很大了

715
00:52:39,884 --> 00:52:45,890
I just wanted you to be strong
and not give up because you lost your dad.
我只是希望你能坚强起来
别自暴自弃,因为你刚失去了父亲

716
00:52:46,974 --> 00:52:52,521
- Philip, you don't have to explain.
- No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.
-菲利普,你不必解释
-不,我要,我一直很爱你,肖恩

717
00:52:52,563 --> 00:52:57,359
And I always thought
you had it in you to do well.
我一直认为你很有潜能

718
00:52:57,401 --> 00:53:01,739
You just need...m-motivation.
你只是需要点...激励

719
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:04,366
Somebody to look up to and...
一个可以做为榜样的人,以及...

720
00:53:07,411 --> 00:53:09,455
I thought it could be me.
我以为那个人会是我

721
00:53:10,998 --> 00:53:14,001
Would you just...take care of your mum?
好好照顾你妈...好吗?

722
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:19,757
There's a good boy.
这样才乖

723
00:53:22,843 --> 00:53:25,346
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.
-艾德,靠边停一下
-等一下

724
00:53:28,015 --> 00:53:30,684
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?
-艾德,麻烦靠边停
-为什么?

725
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:33,646
- Just pull over!
- All right.
-靠边停就是!
-好啦

726
00:53:39,276 --> 00:53:40,736
Whoa, momma!
哇,妈妈!

727
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:44,240
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.
-你究竟在搞啥鬼呀?
-冷静点,大家都很好啊

728
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:46,450
Stop telling me to chill out!
少叫我冷静!

729
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:51,038
- And everybody is not all right.
- What's wrong?
-大家才不好呢
-怎么了?

730
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:53,707
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.
妈,菲利普去了

731
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,335
- Where's he gone?

733
00:53:59,713 --> 00:54:01,715
Get out!
下车!

734
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:05,427
Jesus!
老天!

735
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:08,764
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!
-快打开!
-艾德,打开幼童安全锁!

736
00:54:08,806 --> 00:54:10,891
Quick!
快!

737
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,312
- The child lock!
- Ed!
-幼童安全锁!

738
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:37,293

- We keep moving.
-现在怎么办?

-怎样把菲利普弄出车外?
-没时间了

妈,他过去是,不过现在不是了

742

- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?
-我真的觉得我们可以...
-里头那个不是你老公,懂吗?

743
00:54:50,598 --> 00:54:54,935
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.
虽然外表像他,可是已经完全不是
你所爱的那个男人了

744
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:59,398
Let's go, shall we?
可以走了吗?

745
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,775
You're not suggesting we walk?
你不会是建议我们用走的吧?

746
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:07,615
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.
-大家没事吧?
-嗯,我们时间多的很

747
00:55:08,032 --> 00:55:11,243
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?
也许我们全该手牵手,连成一线?

748
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:13,329
Do you know where we're going?
你知道我们走去哪吗?

749
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,873
- David, come on.
- Sorry.
-大卫,别这样
-对不起

750
00:55:15,956 --> 00:55:18,334
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.
-你知道吗?
-嗯,清楚的很

751
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,960
Are we close?
快到了吗?

752
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:28,177
We're pretty close.
非常接近了

753
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:31,138
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.
-你妈不要紧吧?
-嗯,希望如此

754
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:34,099
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.
-你连络过你的家人吗?
-他们在安地瓜

755
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:37,144
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.
-你认为那里也有发生这种事吗?
-希望没有

756
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:40,272
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...
关于昨晚的事
我知道我说了一大堆,不过...

757
00:55:40,314 --> 00:55:43,108
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.
-你说这与我们的事无关
-是,的确无关

758
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,070
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...
-你说是生死攸关的事
-是没错,不过...

759
00:55:46,153 --> 00:55:51,534
You're not just trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.
你不是想证明什么吧?
我指昨晚我说的话

760
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:57,164
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.
-也许现在不是谈话最佳时机
-好的

761
00:55:58,249 --> 00:55:59,875
Shaun.
肖恩

762
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:01,377
Yvonne.
冯妮

763
00:56:01,418 --> 00:56:04,213
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.
-你怎样?
-还活着

764
00:56:04,255 --> 00:56:06,841
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.
嘿,丽兹,好久不见

765
00:56:06,924 --> 00:56:08,592
Hey, Yvonne.

Erm...my friends Mark, Maggie,
嗯...我朋友马克和梅姬

768
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:17,184

- All right.

-好了

769
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:19,770
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.
这是肖恩和他的女朋友丽兹

770
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:22,815
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?
-其实他们已经分手了
-哦,真的吗?

771
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:25,025
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.
-对
-真可惜

772
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:28,112
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?
我们该走了,你们有要去什么地方吗?

773
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:31,699
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?
-有,我们要去温彻斯特
-酒吧?

774
00:56:33,617 --> 00:56:36,370
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!
-对
-好吧,祝你们好运了!

775
00:56:42,293 --> 00:56:44,044
Hi.
嗨

776
00:56:44,128 --> 00:56:45,588
Hello.
哈

777
00:56:45,629 --> 00:56:46,755
Hi.
嗨

778
00:56:46,797 --> 00:56:48,591
Hello.
哈

779
00:56:48,632 --> 00:56:50,301
All right.
好了

780
00:56:53,053 --> 00:56:55,598
See? The Winchester's just over there.
看见没? 温彻斯特就在那边

781
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:57,975
- Over where?
- Over there.
-哪边?
-那边

782
00:56:58,058 --> 00:57:00,603
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?
就在那边,穿过二十个花园围墙吧?

783
00:57:00,644 --> 00:57:02,480
What's the matter, David?
你有病呀,大卫?

784
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,191
Never taken a short cut before?
以前没走过捷径吗?

785
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:23,709
Shaun.
肖恩

786
00:57:23,751 --> 00:57:26,545
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.
我确定吉儿和德瑞克住这附近

787
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:44,730
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?
过了那围墙就是温彻斯特,好吗?

788
00:57:44,772 --> 00:57:48,067
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?
大家留在原地,我要...
人都到齐了吗?

789

- There's six of us.
-一、二、三、四、五,到齐了
-我们有六个人

790
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:54,114
Mum!
妈!

791
00:57:56,867 --> 00:57:58,911
I'm coming!
我来了!

792
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:01,664
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?
妈,你没事吧? 没事吧?

793
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:04,542
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.
我想吉儿和德瑞克不住这里

794
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:10,923
Shaun?
肖恩?

795
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:14,176
Are you all right?
你没事吧?

796
00:58:31,569 --> 00:58:34,280
What are you doing?
你在做什么?

797
00:58:36,407 --> 00:58:38,450
Shaun!
肖恩!

798
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:43,247
Yes!
好极了!

799
00:58:44,915 --> 00:58:47,126
No, that's rubbish.
不,一点用也没

800
00:58:54,592 --> 00:58:56,802
- Ooh!
- Yes!
哇塞!

801
00:58:58,596 --> 00:59:00,890
Feel free to step in any time.
欢迎随时进来

802
00:59:00,931 --> 00:59:04,059
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.
-你做的不错
-我才不想学你那样

803
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:06,270
I'm so sorry about that.
刚才的事我很抱歉

804
00:59:08,105 --> 00:59:10,191
Right.
好

805
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:16,280
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.
好,大家留在原地
我检查一下路面安全了没

806
00:59:25,122 --> 00:59:27,208
- Is it clear?
- No.
-安全了吗?
-没有

807
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:29,418
- How many?
- Lots.
-有多少?
-多的要命

808
00:59:39,637 --> 00:59:42,640
Oh, well, that is just great.
哦,真是好极了

809
00:59:42,723 --> 00:59:44,892
There are a fair few of them, yes.
外头好多呢

810
00:59:44,975 --> 00:59:48,312
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?
我竟然相信肖恩还会有高明过人的对策?

811
00:59:48,395 --> 00:59:50,564
This is hardly constructive, David!
这话一点建设性也没,大卫!

812
00:59:50,648 --> 00:59:54,443
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?
-我们早该留在公寓里
-那你为何没留在那里?

813
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:58,864
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.
因为...因为,因为...哇队长

814
00:59:58,906 --> 01:00:02,326
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.
-你住嘴行吗?
-放马后炮也于事无补

815
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:12,920
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.
好,我们抖抖双手,活动一下筋骨

816
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,506
Or not.
或者免了

817
01:00:16,423 --> 01:00:20,135
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.
再看一遍他的动作
记住,要非常蹒跚

818
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:25,683
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.
差不多像梦游一样,看看脸部
眼神空洞带点悲伤味道

819
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:28,018
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.
就像赌输了的酒鬼

820
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:30,146
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.
好,来试试看吧? 丽兹

821
01:00:33,941 --> 01:00:38,154
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.
不错,声音做的不错
好的,芭芭拉,那表情太棒了

822
01:00:38,195 --> 01:00:40,698
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.
抱歉,亲爱的,我刚刚分神了

823
01:00:40,781 --> 01:00:43,492
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.
大卫

824
01:00:43,534 --> 01:00:45,536
- Come on!
- Urgh.
-快点!
-呃

825
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:48,998
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.
带点呻吟、悲伤
你死了而且你讨厌那样,开始

826
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:50,791
Uuurgh.
呃

827
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:53,794
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.
-好多了,艾德换你
-我晚上才会做

828
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:56,172
This is the night!
现在就是晚上!

829
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:58,632
- What is that?
- What about yours?
-那是啥呀?
-那你呢?

830
01:00:58,716 --> 01:01:01,677
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?
谁死了让你变成该死的僵尸王?

831
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:03,387
Don't...
别...

832
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,100
Yeah, that's pretty good.
嗯,那样很棒

833
01:01:08,142 --> 01:01:14,064
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.
好,大家一起来试试看,好吗?
一、二、三

834
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:10,287
Go, go, go, go.
快,快,快,快

835
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,042
Shit! Get round me, get round me!
该死! 围住我,围住我!

836
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:19,547
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.
约翰? 约翰、柏妮,你们在吗?
是肖恩和艾德,我们常来的

837
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:22,716
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.
-他们听见你了
-我们有问题了

838
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,301
- They know.
- Stay in character!
-他们晓得了
-继续装死人样!

839
01:02:24,385 --> 01:02:27,596
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.
-我看不见他们
-肖恩,我们必须进去

840
01:02:27,638 --> 01:02:30,266
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!
-破窗而入
-我们会曝光的!

841
01:02:30,307 --> 01:02:33,102

- Is there another way in?
-打破窗子!
-还有别的路进去吗?

842
01:02:33,144 --> 01:02:35,187
Yeah, there's...
嗯,有个...

843
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,691
Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.
等我一下! 嘿,面条

844
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:41,485
- 'All right?'
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.
-好了吗?
-老兄,我现在不方便讲话

845
01:02:41,569 --> 01:02:44,405
- 'You get anything yet?'
- I got nothing.
-拿到货了吗?
-没有

846
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:47,408
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.
我现在有事在忙,对,很奇怪

847
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:51,328
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.
-噢! 你在干嘛呀?
-你在干嘛? 超级大白痴

848
01:02:51,412 --> 01:02:53,956
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!
-滚开
-你才滚开!

849
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:57,543
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life...
该死的滚开! 我这辈子都在...

850
01:02:57,585 --> 01:03:00,838
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you
看着我! 我这辈子都在支持袒护你

851
01:03:00,921 --> 01:03:04,175
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.
你却只会把事情搞砸,令我难堪

852
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:07,344
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!
我不会再让你这样了
今天不行!

853
01:03:07,428 --> 01:03:09,388
Shaun.
肖恩

854
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,723
Oh.
哦

855
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:20,941
You were saying about another way in?
你刚说还有别的路进去?

856
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:23,110
Yeah, there's a...
对,有条...

857
01:03:23,194 --> 01:03:25,779
What are you doing?
你在干嘛呀?

858
01:03:26,947 --> 01:03:30,201
- No!
- Get inside.
-不!
-进去

859
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:34,038
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.
不行,他们会跟我们进去的
继续表演,我得想个办法

860
01:03:34,121 --> 01:03:38,083
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!
-你说想办法是什么意思?
-喂,喂,这边!

861
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:42,296

Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.
这边! 快点! 哦,混帐东西

863
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:48,427

- Gone where?
-等我走了再进去
-走去哪?

864
01:03:48,469 --> 01:03:54,308
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.
不会很久的,我保证
来吧,你们这些行尸走肉,我们走! 跟我来

865

Come and get it. It's a running buffet.

up this window. We're totally exposed.
没差啦,我们必须考虑堵住窗户
我们完全曝光

has to take control of the situation
我们身在虎穴,得要有人来控制情况

882

and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

883
01:05:28,152 --> 01:05:31,322
then perhaps...I should.

-肖恩会一去不回吗?
-他很快就会回来的

885

- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.
-你怎知道?
-我认为他不会丢下我们不管

886

Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?
不会吗? 你怎能信任一个
你觉得不可靠的人呢?

is also an impenetrable fortress.
一个把浪漫夜总会
当成固若金汤城堡的人

What are we going to do?
这是间酒吧! 我们在酒吧里!

I could get a round in.
我可以喝一杯

the window when he gets back.
我们等肖恩回来就是
他一回来,我们就把窗户堵死

What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?
什么时候? 等多久?
几天? 几星期? 一个月?

- Toasties!

-后面有间布列维尔

894
01:06:07,525 --> 01:06:09,819

before he left.
难怪肖恩离开前先带我们来这里

-他就快回来了!
-为什么? 因为他保证过吗?

896
01:06:14,031 --> 01:06:19,119
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?
真要回来的话,你觉得他的超级计划
除了吃花生会能有什么吗?

897
01:06:19,203 --> 01:06:22,331
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?
还是他只要走进来
突然间一切就没事了?

898
01:06:22,373 --> 01:06:26,961
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.
我不知道,大卫!
我不比你知道的还多

899

But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.
但我知道的是我们现在在此
而我们必须善加利用

How did you lose them?
你怎样摆脱他们的?

你打破窗户前我就一直想告诉你

但是跟男朋友吵架
破坏我们伪装的人可不是我

等她变了之后会杀死我们全部
你的前任男朋友搞不清楚这点

就是为了这个缘故,是不是?
他不喜欢我!

只是为了接近丽兹
我只能捡她不要而剩下的破烂

pressing matters at hand here.
大卫! 现在有更加危急的事

1090

- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".
-对,就像“懦夫”拿枪指着我妈
-失去理性的可不是我,“泡菜”

- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.
-老天,她还没死!

1092
01:19:27,324 --> 01:19:29,410

要当英雄,你真够虚伪了

你被却尔登希斯顿开除了

-我是个讲师
-你是个不折不扣的白痴

She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.
她不再是你妈了
她马上就会变成另一具僵尸

1098
01:19:43,257 --> 01:19:46,427
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.
-不准那么说

1099
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:50,431
Please can we just calm the fuck down!

Now, I can see what David is trying to say...
我明白大卫想说什么...

And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.
肖恩... 肖恩,看着我

I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you
我无法想像这对你有多难受

1105
01:20:09,283 --> 01:20:11,702
but we can't afford to fall apart.
但我们不能再分化下去

1106
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:15,706
Shaun, babe...
肖恩,宝贝...

1107
01:20:15,789 --> 01:20:18,792
I know you don't wanna hear this...
我知道你不想听这种话...

1108
01:20:37,186 --> 01:20:39,230
You do it.

01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:51,283
I'm sorry, Mum.
抱歉了,妈

Do it!
开枪!

Well...I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.
我想我们一致同意你做了正确的事

1112

- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.
-我不要待在这里
-大卫,你这是去自杀

- We will. We can defend ourselves.
-我觉得你该走
-我们会的,我们懂得自我防御

- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?
-你是指"我们"吗?
-什么意思?

1118
01:21:37,872 --> 01:21:41,750
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.
现在打开那扇门会是非常愚蠢的行为

1119
01:21:41,834 --> 01:21:44,211
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...
-你想留下来陪他吗?

- Let me finish!
-在他带我们来这儿后还想吗?
-让我把话说完!

Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.
肖恩并没要求你来

I'm so sorry, Dianne.
我很抱歉,黛安

you should be apologising to.
也许你该道歉的人不是我

1126
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:13,699

- The cellar.
- Maybe we can get out!
-地下室
-也许我们能逃出去!

1162

快点!

1168

Why won't it open?
怎么打不开呀?

就这样了,我们被困住了

Whose fucking idea was that?

我救不了小黛或大卫
甚至救不了我妈,我真没用

Erm...two.

if they stand in a line.
我想如果他们排成一排的话

One of us has to go first.

and then do themselves.
一个人射另一个人,然后再对付他们

1188

I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.
该由你来射我
要我自己来的话我会失败的

1189
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:29,557
I don't think I've got it in me
to shoot my flatmate,
我不想在同一个晚上...

1190
01:27:29,598 --> 01:27:33,018

all in the same evening.
射杀我的室友、我妈和我女朋友

Actually...I would like to be shot.
事实上...我愿意被开枪打死

1195
01:27:46,907 --> 01:27:51,287
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag
since yesterday, I promise.
此外,我变了,我从昨天起
