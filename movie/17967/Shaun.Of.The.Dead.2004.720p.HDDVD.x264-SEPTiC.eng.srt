1
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:57,609
Last orders, please.

2
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:06,529
- Shaun.
- Yeah?

3
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:09,914
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, totally.

4
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:13,955
I know he's your best friend
but you do live with him.

5
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,547
I know...

6
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,338
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.

7
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:21,840
It's all right.

8
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:25,256
- It'd just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.

9
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:28,558
-..spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.

10
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:30,760
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.

11
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:34,312
With Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out

12
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,564
and that only exacerbates things.

13
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,773
- What do you mean?
- You guys hardly get on, do you?

14
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,861
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?

15
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:45,030
It means to make things worse.

16
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:47,152
Right, right.

17
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:51,035
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.

18
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:54,830
- Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
- It's all right.

19
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:57,119
And I do want to spend time with you.

20
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:00,255
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.

21
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,834
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?

22
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,880
Anybody?

23
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:10,387
No, thank you.

24
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:12,759
I know...

25
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:15,018
friends are important to Shaun

26
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:18,230
but you must set some
quality time aside for yourselves.

27
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:21,726
Daffs is always taking me
to see these listed buildings

28
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:24,316
and I'm always dragging him to the theatre.

29
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:27,364
- I'm not so hot on theatre.
- How about a meal?

30
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,528
- It's your anniversary soon.
- It was last week.

31
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,496
- Did you do anything special?
- We came here.

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,781
Shaun. Hog lumps.

33
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:39,368
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more,

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,084
more than spending every night
in the Winchester.

35
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,457
I want to do more interesting stuff.

36
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,922
I want you to want to want to do it.

37
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:53,222
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.

38
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:56,137
- Not that I'd know.
- You haven't met his mum?

39
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:59,140
- Not yet.
- Don't you get along with your mum?

40
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,807
- It's not her...
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,185
- No, I love my mum.
- I love his mum.

42
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,562
- * She's like butter *
- Ed!

43
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,855
- Shaun!
- Liz.

44
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:13,111
I understand what
you're trying to say and I agree.

45
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,782
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

46
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:19,246
I'll book a restaurant.
The place that does all the fish.

47
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,249
Just the two of us.

48
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:24,294
Things will change. I promise.

49
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,212
Really, Shaun?

50
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,383
Time, gentlemen.

51
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:34,211
- * This town is coming like a ghost town *
- Shaun?

52
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:43,528
'Player two has entered the game.'

53
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,870
Haven't you got work?

54
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,704
'Player two has left the game.'

55
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:03,975
The front door was open again last night.

56
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,260
- I'm not saying it was you.
- I know, man.

57
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:13,108
- I'm saying it was Ed.
- Right.

58
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:15,227
I can't live like this.

59
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,193
Look at the state of it.
We're not students any more.

60
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:22,277
- Pete...
- He brings no money into the house.

61
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:25,280
- He brings a bit.
- What? Dealing drugs?

62
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,580
He sells a bit of weed now and again.
You've sold puff.

63
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,495
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

64
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:36,454
I've known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he's a laugh.

65
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,177
Because he can
impersonate an orang-utan?

66
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,969
- Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
- Leave him alone.

67
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:45,013
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.

68
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:49,802
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking
apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.

69
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:53,767
- When was that?
- Five years ago.

70
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:56,057
When's he going home?

71
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:59,775
Hey, man, listen... Top left.

72
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:02,443
- Uh-huh.
- I was gonna say... Reload.

73
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:05,776
- I'm on it.
- Erm, since... Nice shot!

74
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:07,902
Thanks.

75
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:10,824
Two seconds.

76
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:13,364
- All right, Noodle?
- 'Got anything?'

77
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,790
- No, man.
- 'Eball says you was holding.'

78
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:18,292
- I ain't got nothing.
- 'Nothing at all?'

79
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:21,873
I've only got an 'enry meself.
All right, laters.

80
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:25,920
- Listen...
- Ed...

81
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:30,598
since you're not working at the moment
could you please clean up a bit?

82
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:34,687
And if you play the answer machine,
can you take down everyone's messages?

83
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,018
- Yep.
- It's not that taxing, is it?

84
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:40,185
Writing something
on a scrap of paper?

85
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:42,523
- Nope.
- Right.

86
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:47,363
Dom, hi...

87
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,734
Come on, it was pretty funny.

88
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,486
- Will you do what he said?
- I ain't doing nothing for him.

89
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,615
Do it for me, then.

90
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,450
I'm sorry, Shaun.

91
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,792
- It's all right.
- No, no.

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,962
I'm sorry, Shaun.

93
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,084
Oh!

94
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,343
Oh, my God, that's rotten.

95
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,008
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I am not laughing.

96
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,969
- Get that.
- You get it.

97
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:22,186
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today

98
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,437
'so can you book the table
for eight rather than seven?

99
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,609
'I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.'

100
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,940
Hey! You're dead.

101
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,836
- Spare some change, please, mister?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,549
Watch out. Are you blind?

103
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,973
'The American
deep space probe Omega 6

104
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:08,235
'unexpectedly re-entered
Earth's atmosphere over England

105
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,354
'and broke apart over...'

106
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,627
Nelson?

107
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,669
Nelson?

108
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,676
Hello, my friend. No beer today?

109
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:38,929
No, it's a bit early for me.

110
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:53,858
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.

111
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,574
Gather round.

112
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,148
As well as Mr Sloman being off today

113
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm afraid Ash is feeling
a little bit under the weather,

114
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:04,619
so I will be taking charge as the...

115
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,666
- Oldest.
- Senior staff member.

116
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,830
So if we can all pull together...

117
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:14,379
- Hello? Hello, mate.
- Noel?

118
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:17,177
I was totally munted last night.

119
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,386
Yeah, I spoke to him. He's only got Henry.

120
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,175
All right, mate. Laters.

121
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:35,190
- Continue.
- Thank you.

122
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:40,990
Erm, as Mr Sloman always says,
there's no I in team but there is an I in pie.

123
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:43,441
In... There's an I in meat pie.

124
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:47,159
The anagram of meat is team...
I don't know what he's talking about.

125
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,579
Phones off. It's not a social gathering.

126
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:54,418
- All right, keep your hair on, grandad.
- Hey! I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.

127
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:57,001
- How old are you? 20? 21?
- 17.

128
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,338
Hey, well...

129
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:04,342
I know you don't wanna be here forever.
I got things I wanna do with my life.

130
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,963
When?

131
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:09,343
You got red on you.

132
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,764
Hello, mate.

133
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,935
This one comes with
a basic digital package.

134
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:21,197
You've got your lifestyle channels there,
a bit of Trisha.

135
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,071
Er, you've got entertainment.
I don't know what that is.

136
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:28,783
News. All the basic, er...news...

137
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,285
- channels.
- 'bizarre events...'

138
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,250
'Coming after me...'

139
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:36,867
- Shaun.
- I'm with customers.

140
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:38,795
It's your dad.

141
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,128
He's not my dad,

142
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,334
he's my stepdad.

143
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:48,589
Philip.

144
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:51,637
Shaun.

145
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:55,933
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?

146
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:59,148
- No.
- Your bimonthly visit.

147
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,232
No, I haven't forgotten.

148
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:03,982
You could bring the flowers
you forgot on Mother's Day.

149
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,070
I was gonna.

150
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,689
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

151
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:11,199
I wasn't gonna.

152
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,873
Well, we look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

153
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,576
OK.

154
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,702
You've got red on you.

155
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:30,427
- I thought it wasn't a social gathering?
- What?

156
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:33,390
How comes you're allowed to
speak to your dad?

157
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:36,684
A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.

158
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,599
And B, it was an emergency.

159
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:43,231
What, like buying your mum some flowers?

160
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:48,615
Noel, I do not find it difficult
to keep my work and my social life separate.

161
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:51,230
Shaun, it's Liz for you.

162
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,403
- Hello.
- 'Hello, it's me.'

163
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,744
- Hello.
- 'Did you get my message?'

164
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,365
- Yep.
- 'So it's all OK, then?'

165
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,586
- Yep.
- 'Eight at the place with all the fish?

166
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:07,335
'Cool, that's great. Just ring me later.'

167
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:11,630
- Goodbye, Liz.
- 'Bye. Bye, bye, bye.'

168
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,047
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.

169
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,676
Sir? Sir?

170
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:24,388
Sorry. Erm, they're for my mum.

171
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:30,028
Mum. "To a wonderful Mum"
or "Supermum"?

172
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,942
- Er...the first one.
- Right.

173
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:53,967
'.. London seems
to have gone completely bonkers...'

174
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:20,446
- Oh, my God! Shaun!
- Yvonne.

175
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:23,532
Oooh! How are you doing?

176
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:25,989
- Surviving.
- Are you living round here?

177
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:29,209
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I just bought a place.

178
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:32,420
- Bought?
- I know, bit grown-up, eh?

179
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:34,872
- Are you still with...?
- Liz.

180
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:39,338
That's great. Glad somebody made it.
How long's that been now?

181
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:43,849
- Er, it's three years ago last week.
- Did you do anything special?

182
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:46,893
- We're going out for a meal tonight.
- Anywhere nice?

183
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:50,889
Yeah...

184
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:57,101
Come on!

185
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,821
- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?

186
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,827
Tidying up.

187
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:08,075
- It doesn't look tidy.
- I had a few beers when I finished.

188
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,662
'Hello, Fulci's. Can you hold, please?'

189
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,166
- Do you want your messages?
- What?

190
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,538
Your mum rang about tomorrow night.

191
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,543
Liz rang about the two of you
eating out tonight.

192
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:22,542
Then your mum rang back to see
if I wanted to eat her out tonight.

193
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,930
- 'Hello, Fulci's.'
- Hi, I know it's short notice

194
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:30,470
but could you possibly do me
a table for two for tonight at about eight?

195
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,438
'Sorry, we just gave away the last table.'

196
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,770
Wasn't true about your mum.

197
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:41,446
Where are we gonna go?

198
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,526
- The Winchester.
- Don't be stupid! They don't do food.

199
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:47,909
- There's a Breville out back.
- Ed, this is serious!

200
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,912
Hello.

201
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,032
- 'Hello, it's me.'
- Hello.

202
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:54,041
'What's the plan, then?'

203
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:58,581
Erm, there's been a bit of a...
a mix-up with the table, babe.

204
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:02,131
- 'What do you mean?'
- They're full up.

205
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:04,928
'But...I thought you said it was all OK?'

206
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,844
Yeah.

207
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,511
'You didn't book it, did you, Shaun?'

208
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,762
- No.
- 'So...what is the plan, then?'

209
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,146
The Winchester?

210
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,944
- 'Hello?'
- Dianne, can you let me in?

211
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,945
- 'I'm not sure, Shaun.'
- Oh, come on.

212
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,664
'Lizzie doesn't want to see you.'

213
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:36,655
- Just open the door!
- 'She doesn't want to see you.'

214
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,786
Do you want me to climb up the wall,
come through the window? Because I will.

215
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,832
'You're not coming in.'

216
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:46,339
- OK, see you in a minute.
- 'Don't...'

217
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,015
'Hi, it's me again.'

218
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:02,734
Can we just talk about this? Let's go out.

219
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,308
- To the Winchester?
- Do you want to?

220
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:08,358
- No, I don't fucking want to!
- OK.

221
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:10,648
It's not the only place in the world.

222
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:13,820
We'll go to the Shepherd's,
they do Thai in there.

223
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:16,788
- I'm going out with David and Di.
- Let's go together.

224
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:20,366
You hang out with my friends?
"A failed actress and a twat"?

225
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:24,083
That's harsh.
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.

226
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:28,795
Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things'll be fine, I promise.

227
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,835
You promised you'd stop smoking.

228
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:34,220
You promised you'd try drinking
red wine instead of beer!

229
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:37,764
- You promised we'd go on holiday.
- We went to Greece!

230
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,217
- We met in Greece.
- At a rave.

231
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:43,271
It's not the same.
You promised things would change.

232
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,767
- You promised us free cable.
- I'm working on that.

233
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:51,279
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don't need them.

234
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,280
W-What was the next one?

235
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,815
It's not enough, Shaun.

236
00:16:55,869 --> 00:17:00,661
'We appear to have
a breakdown in communication there.

237
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:03,411
'lf you or someone you know may...'

238
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,033
I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun.

239
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,961
Get fucked, four-eyes!

240
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,627
You go out with her, you love her so much.

241
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,797
What do you mean by that?

242
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:18,387
'..the devastation really is extensive.
It's a total mess.'

243
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,805
I don't know what he meant by that.

244
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,643
Got you these.

245
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:35,905
- "To a wonderful mum"?
- Oooh!

246
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,571
Yeah, that's because...

247
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:43,031
I thought it would be funny
because of what you said last night

248
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:45,917
about you don't want to be
my mum and that.

249
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:49,873
It's just a little joke,
just sort of spur of the moment.

250
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:54,048
- They're for your mum, aren't they?
- Yeah.

251
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:55,835
Smooth.

252
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,887
If I don't do something, I'll end up in that pub

253
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:10,353
for the rest of my life
like those other sad old fuckers

254
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,435
wondering what the hell happened.

255
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:15,727
What do you mean do something?

256
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:52,430
Fuck her. You got your pint.

257
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,648
You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?

258
00:18:57,486 --> 00:19:00,023
Oh. You want your favourite monkey?

259
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,441
Shall I do Clyde?

260
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,335
See, I knew you'd get over her.

261
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,637
* If you leave me now... *

262
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:31,090
Who the hell put this on?

263
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,681
It's on random.

264
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,565
For fuck's sake. John, yes please, mate.

265
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,603
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.

266
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:46,649
A Bloody Mary first thing,

267
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,115
a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,

268
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:53,495
stagger back here and bang...
back at the bar for shots.

269
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,698
How's that for a slice of fried gold?

270
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,909
- No.
- Come on, man.

271
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:02,379
Talk to me.

272
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:06,919
She said if she stayed with me
she'd end up in here for the rest of her life

273
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,588
Iike these sad old fuckers
wondering what the hell happened.

274
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,513
That is harsh.

275
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,223
- These are rich, interesting characters.
- Like who?

276
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:23,479
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.

277
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,401
He's a bigamist.

278
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:28,530
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

279
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,862
And invented the mobile disco.

280
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:34,068
What about her, then?

281
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:36,694
Ooh! Cockacidal maniac.

282
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,659
She's an ex-porn star.

283
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:44,922
They say she starred in
the world's first interracial hardcore loop.

284
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:47,882
Cafe Au Lait...

285
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:50,499
Pour Vous.

286
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:53,927
Yeah. What about John, then?

287
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:57,058
He's North London Mafia.

288
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:59,177
It's true, Big Al says so.

289
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:02,146
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

290
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,401
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanour.

291
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:08,685
Bernie, the trophy wife.

292
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:11,573
He's connected.
Why is there a rifle above the bar?

293
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:15,150
- The pub's called the Winchester.
- Exactly.

294
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:18,155
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.

295
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:20,162
- Don't, man.
- No.

296
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:22,413
Oi, look at me.

297
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:27,167
Can I just say one thing? I'm not gonna
say there's plenty more fish in the sea,

298
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:29,704
I'm not gonna say if you love her let her go

299
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:35,096
and I'm not gonna bombard you with cliches
but what I will say is this...

300
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:37,011
it's not the end of the world.

301
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,095
Sorry, we're closed.

302
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:49,568
Pisshead.

303
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:56,864
* Ooh, white lines

304
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:58,866
* Visions, dreams of passion

305
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:01,117
* Going through my mind

306
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:03,784
* And all the while I think of you...

307
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:05,575
Oh?

308
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:09,041
What's the matter, love,
haven't you had your tea?

309
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,878
* Something of a phenomenon

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,431

00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,113
What? He should say base.

317
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,152
Or freeze.

318
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:44,863
What a tit.

* You wanna dance? *

320
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:06,179
Don't scratch it! Wait...

321
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:12,227
- That was the second album I ever bought!
- It's four in the fucking morning!

322
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,395
- It's Saturday!
- No, it's not.

323
00:23:14,442 --> 00:23:17,775
It's fucking Sunday
and I've got to go to fucking work

324
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,817
in four fucking hours
because every other fucker is fucking ill!

325
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,487
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?

326
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,444
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey! Pete, look,

327
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:32,165
I'm sorry, we had a couple of drinks,
we split up with Liz tonight.

328
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:36,290
Just keep it down, yeah?

329
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:38,875
Prick.

330
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:40,750
What was that?

331
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:42,295
Nothing.

332
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:46,637
- Stop it, we're friends!
- He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot.

333
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:50,345
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means why don't you fuck off!

334
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:54,141
You wanna live like an animal,
live in the shed, you thick fuck!

335
00:23:54,189 --> 00:23:56,940
- Leave him alone!
- Stop defending him.

336
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:58,856
All he ever does is hold you back.

337
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:02,898
Or is it easier having someone around
who's more of a loser than you?

338
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:06,315
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.

339
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:09,118
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?

340
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,663
Sort your fucking life out, mate.

341
00:24:13,707 --> 00:24:16,079
What's up with your hand, man?

342
00:24:17,294 --> 00:24:20,662
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- By who?

343
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:23,798
- Some crackheads. One of them bit me.
- Why?

344
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:27,008
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them!

345
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:31,133
I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip hop isn't helping.

346
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:34,053
And the front door is open. Again!

347
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,768
It's not hip hop, it's electro. Prick.

348
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:42,437
Next time I see him, he's dead.

349
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,907
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today

- Ed, this is serious.

464
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:12,057
Liz!

465
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:15,522
- 'Shaun.'
- Mum! I was gonna call you. Are you OK?

466
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:17,644
- 'Yes.'
- Are you sure?

467
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:20,317
'Some men tried to get into the house.'

468
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:24,362
- Are they still there?
- 'I'm not sure. We shut the curtains.'

469
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:28,110
- Did you try the police?
- 'Well, I thought about it.'

470
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:31,663
- Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
- 'No, I'm fine.'

471
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:35,872
- Mum?
- 'Well...they were a bit bitey.'

472
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:41,748
- Mum, have you been bitten?
- 'No, but Philip has.'

473
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:43,794
- Oh, OK.
- Has she been bitten?

474
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:45,637
- No, Philip has.
- Oh, OK.

475
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:50,176
- Mum, what state is he in?
- 'He's fine. Bit under the weather.'

476
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,100
- I see.
- What's the deal?

477
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:56,522
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you're not safe there. I'm coming.

478
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:59,934
- 'I don't want to cause a fuss.'
- We're coming to get you, Barbara!

479
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:03,322
So, what's the plan?

480
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,194
Right.

481
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,948
'We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's,

482
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:14,412
'we go in, we take care of Philip.'

483
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,747
I'm so sorry, Philip.

484
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:19,331
'Then we grab Mum, go over to Liz's place,

486

'and wait for all this to blow over.'

487
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:27,505
- Why have we got to go to Liz's?
- Because we do.

488
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:30,341
- She dumped you.
- I have to know if she's all right.

489
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:32,928
- Why?
- Because I love her.

490
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:36,219
All right, gay.

491
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,726
- I'm not staying there, though.
- Why not?

492
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:41,727
If we hole up,
I want to be somewhere familiar,

493
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:45,820
I wanna know where the exits are
and I wanna be allowed to smoke.

494

OK...

497
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,198

No, wait, we can't bring them back here.

502
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,587
- Why not?
- It's not exactly safe, is it?

503
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:10,593
Yeah. Look at the state of it.

504
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:14,421
Where's safe? Where's familiar?

505
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,052
Where can I smoke?

510
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:37,154

Do you believe everything you hear on TV?

Yeah, I can see it, it's just outside.

Any zombies out there?

517
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,508
- Don't say that.
- What?

518
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,551
- That.
- What?

519
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:03,009
That. The Z word. Don't say it.

520
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:05,636
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.

521
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:09,273
All right. Are there any out there, though?

522
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:14,647
Can't see any.
Maybe it's not as bad as all that.

523
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,774
Oh! No, there they are.

524

- OK, let's do this, yeah?
- Yeah?

525
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:23,614
Yeah! I got to do a wee first.

526

Ooh...can I drive?

527
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,328
What?

528
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:31,327
I always wanted to drive Pete's car.
I might not get another chance.

529

OK.

530
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:06,705
Ahh! Oh, God.

531
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:11,126
Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're gonna
borrow your car, OK?

532
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,245
Erm, we'll bring it back.

533
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:18,504
And if you're feeling better later,
we're...we're going to the pub.

You're more than welcome to, er...

join us.

536
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:34,440
Pete'd be so pissed off
if he knew I was driving his car.

537
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:35,942
I don't think so.

538

Shaun, which button's central locking?

539

Oh, cock it!

00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:51,323
Get lost!

541
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:07,221
Drive.

Oh, thank God for that.

Ah, hello.

Who's a pretty boy then?

558

You didn't say Barbara had a Jag.
I've always wanted to drive a Jag.

559

It's Philip's. He won't let anybody near it.

What, what, what, what, what?

564
00:42:42,691 --> 00:42:46,640
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems...

565
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,770
I'll honk three times.

OK.

- Hi, Mum.

569

You've got red on you.

570
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,210
Yeah. Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?

571
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,662
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Where's Philip?

572
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:11,123
- Dad's in the lounge.
- He's not my dad.

573
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:12,505
Really!

574
00:43:12,553 --> 00:43:15,043
Ed's outside,
we'll take you somewhere safe.

575
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:18,181
- What about the doctor?
- I don't think he's gonna come.

576
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:22,269
- Philip won't want to leave the house.
- Philip isn't...

577
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:25,229
Put the kettle on and I'll deal with Philip.

578
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:27,147
- OK.
- OK, then.

579
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:28,935
- You hungry?
- Not really.

580
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:31,393
- I'll make some sandwiches.
- OK.

- I'm so sorry, Philip.
- Why?

588
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,265
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.

- No. Yes.

I was going to give them to the jumble.

- I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
- What?

594
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,446
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
- Don't be silly.

595
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:26,247
Maybe you should stay here
and wait for the doctor.

596
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:29,659
- You said he wasn't coming.
- You didn't call the doctor?

597
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:34,705
- Just to be on the safe side.
- I'm fine. I ran it under a cold tap.

598

We had our jabs when
we went to the lsle of Wight.

- It's overblown nonsense.

- A lot of drug nuts running wild.
- But I should get Mum away.

601
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,266
- I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
- Mum, look!

602
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:51,312
How about that tea?

603
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:55,270
Mum, how much do you love Philip?

604
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:59,102
- Two sugars, is it?
- I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.

605
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:01,611
Oh, yes. Will you cut me some bread, love?

606
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:04,991
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?

607
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,609
Do we have to go through all that again?

608
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:11,827
What would you say if I told you
that Philip's been quite unkind to me?

609
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,868
You weren't easy to live with.

610
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,584
- He chased me with a bit of wood!
- You did call him a you-know-what.

611
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,585
- Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.
- Shaun!

612
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,627
Sorry, Mother... Mum!

613
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:27,304
Did you know that on several occasions...
he touched me?

614
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:36,307
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.

615
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,643
- You don't understand...
- No, you don't understand.

616
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,648
Philip is my husband
and has been for 1 7 years

617
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:46,315
and I would at least expect you
to respect my feelings.

618
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,119
You must be more adult about these things.

619
00:45:49,162 --> 00:45:51,071
Yeah.

620
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:55,333
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when...

621
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:58,826
you just...

622
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,955
gotta be a man.

623
00:46:08,222 --> 00:46:10,795
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.

624
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,807
Hello, Edward.

625
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:15,388
- Hi, Barbara.
- My, how you've grown.

626
00:46:15,437 --> 00:46:18,888
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?

627
00:46:18,941 --> 00:46:22,605
- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?

628
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:26,271
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?

629
00:46:26,323 --> 00:46:29,359
Hmm...I pranged it.

630
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:31,068
You were parked.

631
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,945
Yeah.

632
00:46:32,996 --> 00:46:35,533
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.

633
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,413
- Philip?
- What?

634
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,535
Look out!

635
00:46:43,256 --> 00:46:45,129
Christ!

636
00:46:53,432 --> 00:46:56,267
- Give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.

637
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,513
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.

638
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:01,804
I'm on it.

639
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:04,810
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.

640
00:47:05,944 --> 00:47:09,194
- Maybe I should drive.
- I've adjusted the seat now.

641
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:11,065
Just be careful!

642
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:24,669
Can you please turn that noise down?

643
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:29,623
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

644
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:33,126
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.

645
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:35,385
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.

646
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,595
You do realise this is
a 20 mile an hour zone?

647
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:42,221
Oh, yeah.

648
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,763
- Here.
- Mum, this won't take a second, all right?

649
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:55,483
- Have you still got the child locks on?
- Safety first, Shaun.

650
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:57,609
You can't...

651
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,616
Hey, man, watch the leather.

652
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:06,995
Keep moving. If there's any problems...

653
00:48:07,045 --> 00:48:09,370
I'll do the honks.

654
00:48:33,466 --> 00:48:35,541
'Hello?'

655
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:40,055
Hello?

656
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:03,994
- Guys, can you let me in?
- What are you doing?

657
00:49:04,037 --> 00:49:06,824
I've come to get you.

658
00:49:18,926 --> 00:49:22,970
- What are you doing?
- I've come to take you somewhere safe.

659
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:25,220
- We were safe!
- You don't know that.

660
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:28,385
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?

661
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:29,680
- Lots.
- Lots!

662
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:32,682
It only takes one of them
to know you're in here.

663
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:36,479
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.

664
00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:40,026
- Oh, you made a plan?
- We have to get out of here.

665
00:49:40,072 --> 00:49:42,741
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.

666
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:45,653
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.

667
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:48,572
- Shaun...
- This is not about you and me.

668
00:49:48,622 --> 00:49:50,661
This is about survival.

669
00:49:50,707 --> 00:49:54,704
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere we can stay alive.

670
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:56,994
- We're with you, Shaun.
- What?

671
00:49:57,046 --> 00:49:59,797
- We're with you.
- I'm not going out there.

672
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:04,257
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces
and if you think about it, neither do you.

673
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:07,053
- I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
- She's going.

674
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:09,301
- I'm not staying by myself.
- You're going, aren't you?

675
00:50:09,348 --> 00:50:11,423
- Lizzie?
- Liz?

676
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:19,518
- All right, Flash, what's your plan?
- Great. I've got a car

677
00:50:19,564 --> 00:50:23,263
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?

678
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:25,356
- Yes!
- Great. Where?

679
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:28,271
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.

680
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:29,565
David?

681
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:33,194
I don't see the point
of owning a car in London.

682
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:35,992
Look, just get any blunt objects together.

683
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:38,869
If you get cornered,
bash them in the head.

684
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:41,663
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.

685
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,113
So, what's the plan, then?

686
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,537
We're going to the Winchester.

687
00:50:50,587 --> 00:50:52,460
OK? Let's go.

688
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,681
- Come on.
- Where's the car?

689
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:17,436
What's up, niggaz?

690
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:26,190
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.

691
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,322
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.

692
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,654
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.

693
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:33,610
Hello.

694
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,035
Ed, be careful.

695
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:44,241
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.

696
00:51:44,294 --> 00:51:46,784
- He's bleeding.
- I know! Ed, be careful.

697
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:49,542
Thought you wanted to get there fast?

698
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:53,172
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?

699
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:55,293
Chill out, it's a short cut.

700
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:58,427
- That road goes to the Winchester.
- Shaun...

701
00:51:58,472 --> 00:52:02,800
- Liz, please!
- I don't understand why the Winchester?

702
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:06,015
- It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
- They know us.

703
00:52:06,061 --> 00:52:10,140
- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.

704
00:52:10,189 --> 00:52:12,097
And there's a rifle above the bar.

705
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:16,809
- I would think that's deactivated.
- It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.

706
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,982
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

707
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:20,522
- They can't.
- Can't they?

708
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:22,694
- Of course they can!
- Are you sure?

709
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,273
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.

710
00:52:26,326 --> 00:52:28,780
- Shaun...
- I turned it off, all right?

711
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:31,033
What?

712
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,412
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?

713
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:39,333
You were 12 when I met you,
you'd already grown up so much.

714
00:52:39,377 --> 00:52:45,413
I just wanted you to be strong
and not give up because you lost your dad.

715
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:52,046
- Philip, you don't have to explain.
- No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.

716
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:56,886
And I always thought
you had it in you to do well.

717
00:52:56,932 --> 00:53:01,260
You just need...m-motivation.

718
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,883
Somebody to look up to and...

719
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:08,973
I thought it could be me.

720
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:13,526
Would you just...take care of your mum?

721
00:53:17,156 --> 00:53:19,278
There's a good boy.

722
00:53:22,326 --> 00:53:24,863
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.

723
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:30,201
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

724
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,165
- Just pull over!
- All right.

725
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:40,255
Whoa, momma!

726
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:43,748
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.

727
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:45,958
Stop telling me to chill out!

728
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,551
- And everybody is not all right.
- What's wrong?

729
00:53:50,598 --> 00:53:53,218
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.

730
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,838
- Where's he gone?
- Mum, he's dead.

731
00:53:56,894 --> 00:53:59,182
No, he isn't.

732
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:01,221
Get out!

733
00:54:02,648 --> 00:54:04,936
Jesus!

734
00:54:04,983 --> 00:54:08,267
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!

735
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,394
Quick!

736
00:54:12,823 --> 00:54:14,815
- The child lock!
- Ed!

737
00:54:34,631 --> 00:54:36,788
- Now what?
- We keep moving.

738
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:40,624
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven't got time.

739
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,428
- We can't leave your dad.
- He's not my dad!

740
00:54:43,471 --> 00:54:45,510
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.

741
00:54:45,556 --> 00:54:50,015
- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?

742
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:54,435
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.

743
00:54:56,772 --> 00:54:58,894
Let's go, shall we?

744
00:54:58,941 --> 00:55:01,265
You're not suggesting we walk?

745
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:07,100
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

746
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:10,733
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?

747
00:55:10,783 --> 00:55:12,822
Do you know where we're going?

748
00:55:12,868 --> 00:55:15,358
- David, come on.
- Sorry.

749
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:17,818
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.

750
00:55:17,872 --> 00:55:19,449
Are we close?

751
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,664
We're pretty close.

752
00:55:27,712 --> 00:55:30,628
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.

753
00:55:30,673 --> 00:55:33,589
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.

754
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:36,633
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.

755
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:39,760
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...

756
00:55:39,805 --> 00:55:42,591
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.

757
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,556
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...

758
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:51,020
You're not just trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.

759
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:56,647
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.

760
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:59,359
Shaun.

761
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:00,861
Yvonne.

762
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:03,690
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.

763
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:06,311
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.

764
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:08,073
Hey, Yvonne.

765
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:10,987
Erm...this is my boyfriend, Declan.

766
00:56:11,037 --> 00:56:13,112
Erm...my friends Mark, Maggie,

767
00:56:13,163 --> 00:56:16,661
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
- All right.

768
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:19,245
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

769
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:22,293
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?

770
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,494
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

771
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,582
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?

772
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:31,165
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?

773
00:56:33,053 --> 00:56:35,839
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

774
00:56:41,726 --> 00:56:43,516
Hi.

775
00:56:43,561 --> 00:56:45,054
Hello.

776
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:46,218
Hi.

777
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:48,061
Hello.

778
00:56:48,106 --> 00:56:49,765
All right.

779
00:56:52,484 --> 00:56:55,056
See? The Winchester's just over there.

780
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,435
- Over where?
- Over there.

781
00:56:57,488 --> 00:57:00,060
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

782
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:01,941
What's the matter, David?

783
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,655
Never taken a short cut before?

784
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:23,165
Shaun.

785
00:57:23,216 --> 00:57:26,002
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.

786
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,182
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?

787
00:57:44,232 --> 00:57:47,516
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?

788
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:51,232
- One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
- There's six of us.

789
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:53,567
Mum!

790
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:58,357
I'm coming!

791
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:01,113
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?

792
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:03,995
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

793
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:10,363
Shaun?

794
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:13,624
Are you all right?

795
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:33,726
What are you doing?

796
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,887
Shaun!

797
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:42,684
Yes!

798
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,560
No, that's rubbish.

799
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:56,239
- Ooh!
- Yes!

800
00:58:57,995 --> 00:59:00,319
Feel free to step in any time.

801
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:03,491
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

802
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,698
I'm so sorry about that.

803
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,625
Right.

804
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:15,713
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

805
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:26,632
- Is it clear?
- No.

806
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:28,841
- How many?
- Lots.

807
00:59:39,026 --> 00:59:42,061
Oh, well, that is just great.

808
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,317
There are a fair few of them, yes.

809
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:47,732
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

810
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:49,988
This is hardly constructive, David!

811
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:53,866
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?

812
00:59:53,913 --> 00:59:58,289
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.

813
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:01,748
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.

814
01:00:09,716 --> 01:00:12,342
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.

815
01:00:12,343 --> 01:00:14,915
Or not.

816
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:19,551
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

817
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:25,102
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.

818
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:27,432
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

819
01:00:27,479 --> 01:00:29,554
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.

820
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,569
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.

821
01:00:37,612 --> 01:00:40,102
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

822
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:42,907
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.

823
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:44,941
- Come on!
- Urgh.

824
01:00:44,993 --> 01:00:48,408
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.

825
01:00:48,454 --> 01:00:50,196
Uuurgh.

826
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:53,200
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.

827
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,573
This is the night!

828
01:00:55,626 --> 01:00:58,033
- What is that?
- What about yours?

829
01:00:58,086 --> 01:01:01,086
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

830
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,789
Don't...

831
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:07,500
Yeah, that's pretty good.

832
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:13,468
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.

833
01:02:07,763 --> 01:02:09,671
Go, go, go, go.

834
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:14,423
Shit! Get round me, get round me!

835
01:02:14,477 --> 01:02:18,936
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

836
01:02:19,814 --> 01:02:22,102
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

837
01:02:22,149 --> 01:02:23,690
- They know.
- Stay in character!

838
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:26,983
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

839
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:29,648
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!

840
01:02:29,696 --> 01:02:32,482
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?

841
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:34,571
Yeah, there's...

842
01:02:35,576 --> 01:02:38,066
Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.

843
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:40,870
- 'All right?'
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.

844
01:02:40,913 --> 01:02:43,782
- 'You get anything yet?'
- I got nothing.

845
01:02:43,832 --> 01:02:46,785
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.

846
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:50,700
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.

847
01:02:50,754 --> 01:02:53,326
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!

848
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:56,914
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life...

849
01:02:56,967 --> 01:03:00,216
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you

850
01:03:00,261 --> 01:03:03,545
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.

851
01:03:03,597 --> 01:03:06,716
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!

852
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:08,758
Shaun.

853
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:10,089
Oh.

854
01:03:17,482 --> 01:03:20,316
You were saying about another way in?

855
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,481
Yeah, there's a...

856
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:25,148
What are you doing?

857
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:29,571
- No!
- Get inside.

858
01:03:29,616 --> 01:03:33,399
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.

859
01:03:33,453 --> 01:03:37,449
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!

860
01:03:37,497 --> 01:03:41,659
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!

861
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:44,744
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.

862
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:47,795
- Wait till I've gone then get inside.
- Gone where?

863
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:53,672
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.

864
01:03:53,718 --> 01:03:57,168
Come on, this way, that's it!

865
01:03:57,221 --> 01:04:01,134
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

866
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:04,763
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.

867
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:07,015
All you can eat!

868
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:09,136
Shall we go in, then?

869
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:20,852
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

870
01:04:40,753 --> 01:04:43,504
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- 17.

871
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:49,169
Either way, we need to think about blocking
up this window. We're totally exposed.

872
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,799
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

873
01:04:54,472 --> 01:04:57,425
- Let's get some lights on.
- David, wait!

874
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:01,339
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

875
01:05:01,394 --> 01:05:04,844
- We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
- No, of course not.

876
01:05:04,896 --> 01:05:08,892
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.

877
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,933
I'm just being proactive.

878
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:15,395
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.

879
01:05:15,446 --> 01:05:19,110
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!

880
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:23,070
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody
has to take control of the situation

881
01:05:23,118 --> 01:05:27,446
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

882
01:05:27,497 --> 01:05:30,662
then perhaps...I should.

883
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:34,123
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- He'll be back soon.

884
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:37,084
- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.

885
01:05:37,129 --> 01:05:43,379
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?

886
01:05:43,425 --> 01:05:48,050
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot
is also an impenetrable fortress.

887
01:05:48,096 --> 01:05:51,215
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

888
01:05:51,265 --> 01:05:53,885
I could get a round in.

889
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:57,716
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade
the window when he gets back.

890
01:05:57,770 --> 01:06:00,853
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

891
01:06:00,897 --> 01:06:03,102
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!

892
01:06:03,149 --> 01:06:06,766
- There's a Breville out back.
- Great. Saved by nibbles.

893
01:06:06,818 --> 01:06:09,142
Must be why Shaun took us here
before he left.

894
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:13,322
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

895
01:06:13,365 --> 01:06:18,440
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?

896
01:06:18,493 --> 01:06:21,658
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?

897
01:06:21,704 --> 01:06:26,281
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.

898
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:30,910
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.

899
01:06:32,629 --> 01:06:35,582
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

900
01:06:35,631 --> 01:06:38,750
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?

901
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,005
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.

902
01:06:41,052 --> 01:06:44,716
We'll have a party
and get completely smashed.

903
01:06:44,763 --> 01:06:48,510
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.

904
01:06:48,558 --> 01:06:52,139
- David!
- We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.

905
01:06:57,523 --> 01:06:59,100
Pickle!

906
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:00,891
Hello, Mum. You all right?

907
01:07:00,942 --> 01:07:03,017
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

908
01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:05,310
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- No.

909
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:07,603
- Check upstairs?
- It's locked.

910
01:07:07,655 --> 01:07:10,192
- Phones?
- Dead. Same as the power.

911
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:14,284
- OK...
- Nice of you to join us.

912
01:07:14,327 --> 01:07:16,947
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't l?

913
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,577
How did you lose them?

914
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:30,834
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.

915
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:33,667
- Well, how did you get in?
- The back door.

916
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:36,207
I tried to tell you
before you smashed the window.

917
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,628
But it wasn't me blowing our cover
by arguing with my boyfriend.

918
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,462
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

919
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:45,638
Thanks, babe.

920
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:49,135
So, what's the plan, then?

921
01:07:51,188 --> 01:07:53,814
Would anyone like a peanut?

922
01:08:03,823 --> 01:08:06,028
Why don't you do your Clyde?

923
01:08:06,074 --> 01:08:09,109
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?

924
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,113
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orang-utan.

925
01:08:12,162 --> 01:08:14,866
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

926
01:08:14,914 --> 01:08:17,748
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on.

927
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,956
- You've built it up too much.
- No, just do it.

928
01:08:21,002 --> 01:08:23,918
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

929
01:08:23,963 --> 01:08:26,535
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.

930
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,712
I'm not a performing monkey.

931
01:08:31,177 --> 01:08:34,545
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

932
01:08:34,596 --> 01:08:38,544
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.

933
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:42,430
- What about the lights?
- Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.

934
01:08:42,477 --> 01:08:46,308
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.

935
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,726
It's quite simple, David.

936
01:09:16,627 --> 01:09:19,295
- Is that it?
- That's it.

937
01:09:45,524 --> 01:09:49,022
Liz, erm...have you got a quid?

938
01:09:50,111 --> 01:09:51,984
Erm...

939
01:09:53,947 --> 01:09:55,571
Yeah.

940
01:10:00,118 --> 01:10:02,406
Never anything on, is there?

941
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:08,789
What?

942
01:10:10,793 --> 01:10:14,872
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?

943
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:22,707
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.

944
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,131
Yeah.

945
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:29,804
Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet then, won't we?

946
01:10:31,225 --> 01:10:33,300
What?

947
01:10:35,103 --> 01:10:37,557
Ed, no!

948
01:10:37,605 --> 01:10:39,727
Turn it off!

949
01:11:11,214 --> 01:11:13,170
Shit!

950
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,919
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I dunno.

951
01:11:19,845 --> 01:11:22,880
- Who put this on?
- It's on random.

952
01:11:22,931 --> 01:11:26,180
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

953
01:11:26,225 --> 01:11:28,015
- What?!
- The jukebox!

954
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,764
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?

955
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:32,887
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

956
01:11:32,938 --> 01:11:36,436
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.

957
01:11:36,483 --> 01:11:39,566
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

958
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:41,566
How about pool?

959
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:44,943
* Don't stop me now

960
01:11:44,989 --> 01:11:46,981
* Don't stop me

961
01:11:47,032 --> 01:11:50,281
- * Cos I'm having... *
- John, it's time at the bar.

962
01:11:50,326 --> 01:11:54,157
* I'm a shooting star
leaping through the sky like a tiger

963
01:11:54,204 --> 01:11:57,821
* Defying the laws of gravity

964
01:11:57,874 --> 01:12:02,166
* I'm a racing car passing by
like Lady Godiva

965
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:04,664
* I'm gonna go, go, go

966
01:12:04,712 --> 01:12:07,249
* There's no stopping me

967
01:12:07,297 --> 01:12:09,585
* I'm burning through the sky...

968
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:12,549
- I can't find the switches!
- Then get the fuses!

969
01:12:12,968 --> 01:12:14,924
* That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit

970
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,175
* I'm travelling at the speed of light

971
01:12:17,222 --> 01:12:21,135
* I wanna make
a supersonic man out of you

972
01:12:21,183 --> 01:12:23,305
* Don't stop me now

973
01:12:23,351 --> 01:12:25,473
* I'm having such a good time

974
01:12:25,519 --> 01:12:27,594
* I'm having a ball

975
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:29,554
* Don't stop me now

976
01:12:29,606 --> 01:12:31,763
* If you wanna have a good time

977
01:12:31,816 --> 01:12:33,689
* Just give me a call

978
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:36,354
* Don't stop me now
cos I'm having a good time

979
01:12:36,403 --> 01:12:38,276
* Don't stop me now

980
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:44,073
* Yes I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

981
01:12:44,117 --> 01:12:48,160
- * I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars...
- Why is Queen still on?

982
01:12:48,203 --> 01:12:50,740
- We have a situation!
- I know!

983
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:54,114
- Fuck this. Two seconds.
- Ed!

984
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,790
Oi!

985
01:12:55,834 --> 01:13:00,660
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

986
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:03,832
* I'm burning through the sky, yeah...

987
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:05,708
Shaun!

988
01:13:05,758 --> 01:13:07,915
*..call me Mister Fahrenheit...

989
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:09,509
No!

990
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,717
Yes! Yes! In the head!

991
01:13:16,516 --> 01:13:18,389
Ooow!

992
01:13:18,434 --> 01:13:20,011
Shauny!

993
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,217
* Don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

994
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:26,218
* Don't stop me, don't stop me
good time, good time

995
01:13:26,273 --> 01:13:28,229
* Don't stop me... *

996
01:13:35,906 --> 01:13:38,313
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?

997
01:13:39,742 --> 01:13:41,983
Ed, for the last time, it's...

998
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:49,825
I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.

999
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,748
OK.

1000
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,459
But dogs can look up.

1001
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:02,746
- Has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.

1002
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,133
- Apart from Ed?
- I'm a pacifist.

1003
01:14:05,178 --> 01:14:08,012
- Apart from David and Ed?
- What was Ed's experience?

1004
01:14:08,055 --> 01:14:11,387
- He shot his sister in the leg.
- I think you should do it.

1005
01:14:11,432 --> 01:14:14,681
- We should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?

1006
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:17,680
- No one has any experience. We've got...
- 29.

1007
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:19,768
- 29 bullets.
- Call them shells.

1008
01:14:19,814 --> 01:14:22,933
29 shells. I need someone
to help me reload,

1009
01:14:22,983 --> 01:14:25,520
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

1010
01:14:25,568 --> 01:14:30,608
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing
that will redeem mankind is co-operation.

1011
01:14:30,655 --> 01:14:32,812
I think we can all appreciate that now.

1012
01:14:32,865 --> 01:14:36,529
- Was that on a beer mat?
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

1013
01:14:36,576 --> 01:14:38,484
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1014
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:43,286
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

1015
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:47,030
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1016
01:14:49,294 --> 01:14:51,618
- Barbara.
- Oh, hello.

1017
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:54,754
- Would you like to come with me?
- That'd be lovely.

1018
01:14:56,174 --> 01:15:01,463
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.

1019
01:15:01,512 --> 01:15:03,587
- Really?
- Yeah.

1020
01:15:03,638 --> 01:15:05,630
- Ah!
- Barbara?

1021
01:15:07,058 --> 01:15:09,630
Are you all right?

1022
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:11,558
I've got something for you.

1023
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:16,428
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1024
01:15:16,481 --> 01:15:20,062
- I'd like you to have it.
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...

1025
01:15:20,109 --> 01:15:23,109
It seems only right.

1026
01:15:37,414 --> 01:15:39,453
I didn't want to say anything.

1027
01:15:39,499 --> 01:15:41,704
I thought Shaun would be worried.

1028
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,244
Liz!

1029
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:47,085
Here they come!

1030
01:15:48,422 --> 01:15:50,710
- Stay behind me!
- There's one!

1031
01:15:50,757 --> 01:15:53,211
Sorry, we're closed!

1032
01:15:53,259 --> 01:15:55,583
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.

1033
01:15:55,636 --> 01:15:57,793
Cock it!

1034
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:06,724
- There!
- Where?

1035
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:08,761
Three o'clock!

1036
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:17,689
- Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
- What?

1037
01:16:17,736 --> 01:16:19,893
- 11:45!
- Keep it simple!

1038
01:16:21,072 --> 01:16:22,898
Top left!

1039
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:27,280
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1040
01:16:27,326 --> 01:16:29,448
Come on, come on.

1041
01:16:32,872 --> 01:16:34,698
Nice shot.

1042
01:16:34,749 --> 01:16:37,417
OK, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1043
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,664
Ed, take over a sec.

1044
01:16:39,752 --> 01:16:42,378
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1045
01:16:42,379 --> 01:16:47,247
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1046
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:53,627
- Mum, I don't understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.

1047
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,928
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1048
01:16:56,974 --> 01:17:00,057
No, you should've said.

1049
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:03,266
- Take over a sec.
- What's going on?

1050
01:17:03,312 --> 01:17:05,802
- What's up?
- What the hell's going on?

1051
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:09,104
- Barbara's hurt!
- Just take over a minute.

1052
01:17:09,149 --> 01:17:11,057
Jesus.

1053
01:17:11,109 --> 01:17:13,231
I know first aid.

1054
01:17:13,278 --> 01:17:16,231
Just hang on. Mum!

1055
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,770
- Mum.
- Is she...?

1056
01:17:18,823 --> 01:17:21,147
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1057
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,365
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1058
01:17:25,704 --> 01:17:29,617
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1059
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:34,369
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1060
01:17:35,419 --> 01:17:38,335
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.

1061
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,585
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1062
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:43,002
Mum. Please don't go.

1063
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,559
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1064
01:17:57,603 --> 01:18:00,223
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1065
01:18:00,271 --> 01:18:02,642
- She's gonna come back!
- She's not going anywhere.

1066
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:05,097
- She'll change.
- She's my mum!

1067
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,901
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that.

1068
01:18:08,944 --> 01:18:11,315
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.

1069
01:18:11,363 --> 01:18:13,438
One...

1070
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:14,947
two...

1071
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:16,235
three!

1072
01:18:16,283 --> 01:18:19,069
- Don't point that gun at my mum!
- Calm down.

1073
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:21,656
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1074
01:18:21,704 --> 01:18:24,158
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What's that mean?

1075
01:18:24,206 --> 01:18:26,577
- This isn't exactly fair.
- Here.

1076
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:28,497
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1077
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:32,668
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1078
01:18:32,712 --> 01:18:34,585
Tell him to put the gun down!

1079
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:36,871
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.

1080
01:18:36,924 --> 01:18:42,261
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.

1081
01:18:42,303 --> 01:18:45,587
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!

1082
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:48,129
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum.

1083
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:51,929
- She's not...
- You've never thought I was good enough.

1084
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:55,226
- What?
- We all know you're in love with Liz.

1085
01:18:55,271 --> 01:18:57,725
- That is not true.
- Yes it is!

1086
01:18:57,773 --> 01:18:59,812
- That is not true.
- Yes it is.

1087
01:18:59,858 --> 01:19:02,562
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me

1088
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:07,603
to get close to Liz and when she knocked
you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.

1089
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:11,402
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1090
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,818
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you...

1091
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:19,031
David! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here.

1092
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,242
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".

1093
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:26,375
- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.

1094
01:19:26,419 --> 01:19:28,541
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.

1095
01:19:28,588 --> 01:19:31,339
You've gone from
a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.

1096
01:19:31,381 --> 01:19:33,207
I'm not a chartered accountant.

1097
01:19:33,258 --> 01:19:35,463
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.

1098
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:38,544
- I'm a lecturer.
- You're a twat.

1099
01:19:38,595 --> 01:19:42,294
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.

1100
01:19:42,348 --> 01:19:45,550
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1101
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,548
Please can we just calm the fuck down!

1102
01:19:51,146 --> 01:19:54,763
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1103
01:19:54,816 --> 01:19:57,104
- Thank you.
- Even if he is being a twat.

1104
01:19:57,151 --> 01:19:58,977
Yep.

1105
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,943
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.

1106
01:20:04,698 --> 01:20:08,315
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you

1107
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:10,822
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1108
01:20:11,995 --> 01:20:14,829
Shaun, babe...

1109
01:20:14,872 --> 01:20:17,907
I know you don't wanna hear this...

1110
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,339
You do it.

1111
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:50,395
I'm sorry, Mum.

1112
01:20:51,775 --> 01:20:54,146
Do it!

1113
01:21:09,122 --> 01:21:13,663
Well...I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1114
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:21,703
David, no!

1115
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:23,918
David!

1116
01:21:24,008 --> 01:21:26,634
- Right, I'm leaving.
- What?

1117
01:21:26,635 --> 01:21:29,207
- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.

1118
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:34,421
- I think you should go.
- We will. We can defend ourselves.

1119
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,928
- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?

1120
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:40,842
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.

1121
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:43,302
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...

1122
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:45,644
- After where he led us?
- Let me finish!

1123
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:49,818
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.

1124
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:52,647
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...

1125
01:21:52,696 --> 01:21:54,569
David!

1126
01:22:02,078 --> 01:22:04,200
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1127
01:22:04,246 --> 01:22:08,325
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

1128
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:12,791
Shaun...

1129
01:22:17,923 --> 01:22:19,879
David! No!

1130
01:22:19,925 --> 01:22:22,249
No! No! No!

1131
01:22:24,053 --> 01:22:26,009
David!

1132
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:28,760
- No! No!
- David!

1133
01:22:49,656 --> 01:22:51,813
David!

1134
01:22:52,491 --> 01:22:54,198
Dianne, no!

1135
01:22:54,242 --> 01:22:55,866
I'm coming, David!

1136
01:22:59,163 --> 01:23:01,617
David!

1137
01:23:01,665 --> 01:23:03,538
Oh dear.

1138
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:05,788
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1139
01:23:16,718 --> 01:23:18,460
Stay back!

1140
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:25,465
Shaun, hold them!

1141
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:30,469
Heads!

1142
01:23:34,356 --> 01:23:36,264
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1143
01:23:38,067 --> 01:23:40,474
Shauny, look who it is.

1144
01:23:40,527 --> 01:23:43,099
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1145
01:23:44,655 --> 01:23:46,314
Ed!

1146
01:23:46,365 --> 01:23:48,321
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1147
01:23:48,366 --> 01:23:50,358
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1148
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:52,236
I can't hold them!

1149
01:23:55,872 --> 01:23:57,282
No!

1150
01:24:01,376 --> 01:24:03,166
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1151
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:07,245
I said leave him alone!

1152
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:13,383
Ed. Ed!

1153
01:24:13,427 --> 01:24:16,510
Shaun, bar!

1154
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:29,477
Ed!

1155
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,223
Ed!

1156
01:24:32,858 --> 01:24:35,526
Ed!

1157
01:24:35,568 --> 01:24:37,476
What?

1158
01:24:37,528 --> 01:24:39,769
Chuck us a cloth, will you?

1159
01:24:52,957 --> 01:24:55,447
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1160
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,037
Oh, fuck.

1161
01:24:58,544 --> 01:25:00,334
Ow!

1162
01:25:00,379 --> 01:25:02,003
Fuck it!

1163
01:25:02,047 --> 01:25:04,963
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1164
01:25:05,007 --> 01:25:07,497
- The cellar.
- Maybe we can get out!

1165
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:12,507
- There's a hatch out on to the street.
- You mean go back outside?

1166
01:25:12,555 --> 01:25:15,389
Oh, give us a fucking break!

1167
01:25:21,353 --> 01:25:23,594
Go!

1168
01:25:33,153 --> 01:25:35,358
I can see the street.

1169
01:25:36,448 --> 01:25:37,822
Come on.

1170
01:25:39,241 --> 01:25:41,316
Come on!

1171
01:25:42,202 --> 01:25:44,870
Why won't it open?

1172
01:25:54,836 --> 01:25:59,081
That's it then, we're trapped.
"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"

1173
01:25:59,131 --> 01:26:01,039
Whose fucking idea was that?

1174
01:26:01,091 --> 01:26:03,925
Man, I've really ballsed this up.

1175
01:26:07,388 --> 01:26:11,052
- No, you haven't.
- I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.

1176
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:15,890
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save Mum. I'm useless.

1177
01:26:15,936 --> 01:26:21,604
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that's what counts.

1178
01:26:23,608 --> 01:26:25,683
Yeah, I suppose.

1179
01:26:28,195 --> 01:26:30,946
Do you think they'll get through?

1180
01:26:30,989 --> 01:26:32,862
Yeah.

1181
01:26:34,283 --> 01:26:36,524
How many shells have we got left?

1182
01:26:36,576 --> 01:26:39,741
Erm...two.

1183
01:26:39,787 --> 01:26:44,910
I suppose we could take a few of them out
if they stand in a line.

1184
01:26:44,957 --> 01:26:47,162
I wasn't thinking about them.

1185
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:48,951
I know.

1186
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:58,589
- What about Ed? There's only two shells.
- I don't mind being eaten.

1187
01:27:02,429 --> 01:27:04,883
How are we gonna do this?

1188
01:27:04,931 --> 01:27:07,635
I don't know. Erm...

1189
01:27:07,683 --> 01:27:09,758
One of us has to go first.

1190
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:13,011
One should do the other
and then do themselves.

1191
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:16,097
You should do me.
I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.

1192
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:28,564
I don't think I've got it in me
to shoot my flatmate,

1193
01:27:28,615 --> 01:27:32,030
my mum and my girlfriend
all in the same evening.

1194
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:35,610
What makes you think I've taken you back?

1195
01:27:35,662 --> 01:27:37,535
Well...

1196
01:27:38,623 --> 01:27:40,994
you don't want to die single, do you?

1197
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:44,824
Actually...I would like to be shot.

1198
01:27:45,878 --> 01:27:50,289
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag
since yesterday, I promise.

1199
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,462
He hasn't.

1200
01:27:54,176 --> 01:27:56,500
Maybe we should have one now.

1201
01:27:59,805 --> 01:28:02,840
- You left them in my flat.
- Yeah, in the bin.

1202
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:05,926
- I was desperate.
- Sneaky monkey.

1203
01:28:05,977 --> 01:28:09,226
- Sorry.
- I won't say anything.

1204
01:28:21,572 --> 01:28:23,979
Come on, we're getting out of here.

1205
01:28:24,991 --> 01:28:27,991
- I might just stay here.
- But we can get out.

1206
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:31,568
- You two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?

1207
01:28:31,621 --> 01:28:34,989
- I only hold you back.
- Yeah, but...

1208
01:28:40,836 --> 01:28:42,875
Maybe you should have this.

1209
01:28:44,214 --> 01:28:45,956
- Don't you want it?
- No.

1210
01:28:46,007 --> 01:28:48,960
I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.

1211
01:28:52,387 --> 01:28:55,885
- Ed, I'm sorry.
- What for?

1212
01:28:55,931 --> 01:29:00,757
- Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
- It's all right.

1213
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:03,134
I'm sorry too.

1214
01:29:03,186 --> 01:29:05,261
It's OK.

1215
01:29:05,313 --> 01:29:07,055
No...

1216
01:29:07,106 --> 01:29:09,181
I'm sorry, Shaun.

1217
01:29:12,026 --> 01:29:15,275
Oh, God! That's not funny.

1218
01:29:15,321 --> 01:29:20,230
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I'm not laughing.

1219
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,624
You'd better be off.

1220
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:46,708
Bye, Ed. Love you.

1221
01:29:47,553 --> 01:29:49,177
Cheers.

1222
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:52,255
I love you too, man.

1223
01:29:55,434 --> 01:29:57,509
Gay.

1224
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,817
- Ready?
- Ready.

1225
01:30:30,585 --> 01:30:32,992
Section One. Ready.

1226
01:30:33,046 --> 01:30:35,334
Zombies to your front. Fire!

1227
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:40,758
Fire!

1228
01:30:55,312 --> 01:30:57,932
