1
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,355
Last orders, please.

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,275
- Shaun.
- Yeah?

3
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:09,660
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, totally.

4
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:13,701
I know he's your best friend
but you do live with him.

5
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,293
I know...

6
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:19,084
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.

7
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:21,586
It's all right.

8
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:25,002
- It'd just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.

9
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:28,304
-..spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.

10
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:30,506
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.

11
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:34,058
With Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out

12
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:36,310
and that only exacerbates things.

13
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:40,519
- What do you mean?
- You guys hardly get on, do you?

14
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,607
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?

15
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:44,776
It means to make things worse.

16
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:46,898
Right, right.

17
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,781
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.

18
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:54,576
- Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
- It's all right.

19
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:56,865
And I do want to spend time with you.

20
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,001
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.

21
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:03,580
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?

22
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,626
Anybody?

23
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:10,133
No, thank you.

24
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,505
I know...

25
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:14,764
friends are important to Shaun

26
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,976
but you must set some
quality time aside for yourselves.

27
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:21,472
Daffs is always taking me
to see these listed buildings

28
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:24,062
and I'm always dragging him to the theatre.

29
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,110
- I'm not so hot on theatre.
- How about a meal?

30
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:30,274
- It's your anniversary soon.
- It was last week.

31
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:33,242
- Did you do anything special?
- We came here.

32
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,527
Shaun. Hog lumps.

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,114
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more,

34
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,830
more than spending every night
in the Winchester.

35
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,203
I want to do more interesting stuff.

36
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:49,668
I want you to want to want to do it.

37
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,968
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.

38
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:55,883
- Not that I'd know.
- You haven't met his mum?

39
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:58,886
- Not yet.
- Don't you get along with your mum?

40
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:02,553
- It's not her...
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?

41
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:04,931
- No, I love my mum.
- I love his mum.

42
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:07,308
- * She's like butter *
- Ed!

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,601
- Shaun!
- Liz.

44
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:12,857
I understand what
you're trying to say and I agree.

45
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:15,528
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

46
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:18,992
I'll book a restaurant.
The place that does all the fish.

47
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:20,995
Just the two of us.

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Things will change. I promise.

49
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:25,958
Really, Shaun?

50
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,129
Time, gentlemen.

51
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:33,957
- * This town is coming like a ghost town *
- Shaun?

52
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,274
'Player two has entered the game.'

53
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:45,616
Haven't you got work?

54
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:48,450
'Player two has left the game.'

55
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,721
The front door was open again last night.

56
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:09,006
- I'm not saying it was you.
- I know, man.

57
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,854
- I'm saying it was Ed.
- Right.

58
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:14,973
I can't live like this.

59
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:18,939
Look at the state of it.
We're not students any more.

60
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:22,023
- Pete...
- He brings no money into the house.

61
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:25,026
- He brings a bit.
- What? Dealing drugs?

62
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,326
He sells a bit of weed now and again.
You've sold puff.

63
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:31,241
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

64
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,200
I've known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he's a laugh.

65
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,923
Because he can
impersonate an orang-utan?

66
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,715
- Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
- Leave him alone.

67
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,759
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.

68
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:49,548
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking
apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.

69
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,513
- When was that?
- Five years ago.

70
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,803
When's he going home?

71
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,521
Hey, man, listen... Top left.

72
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,189
- Uh-huh.
- I was gonna say... Reload.

73
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,522
- I'm on it.
- Erm, since... Nice shot!

74
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,648
Thanks.

75
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,570
Two seconds.

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,110
- All right, Noodle?
- 'Got anything?'

77
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,536
- No, man.
- 'Eball says you was holding.'

78
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,038
- I ain't got nothing.
- 'Nothing at all?'

79
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:21,619
I've only got an 'enry meself.
All right, laters.

80
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,666
- Listen...
- Ed...

81
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,344
since you're not working at the moment
could you please clean up a bit?

82
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,433
And if you play the answer machine,
can you take down everyone's messages?

83
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,764
- Yep.
- It's not that taxing, is it?

84
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,931
Writing something
on a scrap of paper?

85
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,269
- Nope.
- Right.

86
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:47,109
Dom, hi...

87
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:49,480
Come on, it was pretty funny.

88
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:53,232
- Will you do what he said?
- I ain't doing nothing for him.

89
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,361
Do it for me, then.

90
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,196
I'm sorry, Shaun.

91
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,538
- It's all right.
- No, no.

92
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,708
I'm sorry, Shaun.

93
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:07,830
Oh!

94
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:10,089
Oh, my God, that's rotten.

95
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:13,754
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I am not laughing.

96
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:15,715
- Get that.
- You get it.

97
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:21,932
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today

98
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,183
'so can you book the table
for eight rather than seven?

99
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,355
'I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.'

100
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:32,686
Hey! You're dead.

101
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,582
- Spare some change, please, mister?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:49,295
Watch out. Are you blind?

103
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:03,719
'The American
deep space probe Omega 6

104
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,981
'unexpectedly re-entered
Earth's atmosphere over England

105
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:10,100
'and broke apart over...'

106
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,373
Nelson?

107
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,415
Nelson?

108
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,422
Hello, my friend. No beer today?

109
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,675
No, it's a bit early for me.

110
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,604
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.

111
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,320
Gather round.

112
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:58,894
As well as Mr Sloman being off today

113
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,866
I'm afraid Ash is feeling
a little bit under the weather,

114
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,365
so I will be taking charge as the...

115
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:07,412
- Oldest.
- Senior staff member.

116
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:10,576
So if we can all pull together...

117
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:14,125
- Hello? Hello, mate.
- Noel?

118
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:16,923
I was totally munted last night.

119
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,132
Yeah, I spoke to him. He's only got Henry.

120
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,921
All right, mate. Laters.

121
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,936
- Continue.
- Thank you.

122
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:40,736
Erm, as Mr Sloman always says,
there's no I in team but there is an I in pie.

123
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,187
In... There's an I in meat pie.

124
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:46,905
The anagram of meat is team...
I don't know what he's talking about.

125
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,325
Phones off. It's not a social gathering.

126
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:54,164
- All right, keep your hair on, grandad.
- Hey! I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.

127
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,747
- How old are you? 20? 21?
- 17.

128
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,084
Hey, well...

129
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:04,088
I know you don't wanna be here forever.
I got things I wanna do with my life.

130
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,709
When?

131
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:09,089
You got red on you.

132
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,510
Hello, mate.

133
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:16,681
This one comes with
a basic digital package.

134
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:20,943
You've got your lifestyle channels there,
a bit of Trisha.

135
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:24,817
Er, you've got entertainment.
I don't know what that is.

136
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:28,529
News. All the basic, er...news...

137
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:31,031
- channels.
- 'bizarre events...'

138
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,996
'Coming after me...'

139
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,613
- Shaun.
- I'm with customers.

140
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,541
It's your dad.

141
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,874
He's not my dad,

142
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:43,080
he's my stepdad.

143
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,335
Philip.

144
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:51,383
Shaun.

145
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:55,679
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?

146
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:58,894
- No.
- Your bimonthly visit.

147
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,978
No, I haven't forgotten.

148
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,728
You could bring the flowers
you forgot on Mother's Day.

149
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,816
I was gonna.

150
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:08,435
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

151
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,945
I wasn't gonna.

152
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:15,619
Well, we look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

153
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,322
OK.

154
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:19,448
You've got red on you.

155
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:30,173
- I thought it wasn't a social gathering?
- What?

156
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:33,136
How comes you're allowed to
speak to your dad?

157
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,430
A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.

158
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:39,345
And B, it was an emergency.

159
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:42,977
What, like buying your mum some flowers?

160
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:48,361
Noel, I do not find it difficult
to keep my work and my social life separate.

161
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,976
Shaun, it's Liz for you.

162
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:56,149
- Hello.
- 'Hello, it's me.'

163
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:58,490
- Hello.
- 'Did you get my message?'

164
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:01,111
- Yep.
- 'So it's all OK, then?'

165
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,332
- Yep.
- 'Eight at the place with all the fish?

166
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:07,081
'Cool, that's great. Just ring me later.'

167
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,376
- Goodbye, Liz.
- 'Bye. Bye, bye, bye.'

168
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:14,793
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.

169
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:21,422
Sir? Sir?

170
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:24,134
Sorry. Erm, they're for my mum.

171
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:29,774
Mum. "To a wonderful Mum"
or "Supermum"?

172
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:32,688
- Er...the first one.
- Right.

173
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,713
'.. London seems
to have gone completely bonkers...'

174
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:20,192
- Oh, my God! Shaun!
- Yvonne.

175
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:23,278
Oooh! How are you doing?

176
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,735
- Surviving.
- Are you living round here?

177
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:28,955
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I just bought a place.

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,166
- Bought?
- I know, bit grown-up, eh?

179
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,618
- Are you still with...?
- Liz.

180
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:39,084
That's great. Glad somebody made it.
How long's that been now?

181
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:43,595
- Er, it's three years ago last week.
- Did you do anything special?

182
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,639
- We're going out for a meal tonight.
- Anywhere nice?

183
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,635
Yeah...

184
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:56,847
Come on!

185
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:02,567
- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?

186
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,573
Tidying up.

187
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:07,821
- It doesn't look tidy.
- I had a few beers when I finished.

188
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,408
'Hello, Fulci's. Can you hold, please?'

189
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:12,912
- Do you want your messages?
- What?

190
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,284
Your mum rang about tomorrow night.

191
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,289
Liz rang about the two of you
eating out tonight.

192
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,288
Then your mum rang back to see
if I wanted to eat her out tonight.

193
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,676
- 'Hello, Fulci's.'
- Hi, I know it's short notice

194
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:30,216
but could you possibly do me
a table for two for tonight at about eight?

195
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:33,184
'Sorry, we just gave away the last table.'

196
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:39,516
Wasn't true about your mum.

197
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:41,192
Where are we gonna go?

198
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:44,272
- The Winchester.
- Don't be stupid! They don't do food.

199
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:47,655
- There's a Breville out back.
- Ed, this is serious!

200
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,658
Hello.

201
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,778
- 'Hello, it's me.'
- Hello.

202
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,787
'What's the plan, then?'

203
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:58,327
Erm, there's been a bit of a...
a mix-up with the table, babe.

204
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:01,877
- 'What do you mean?'
- They're full up.

205
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:04,674
'But...I thought you said it was all OK?'

206
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,590
Yeah.

207
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:09,257
'You didn't book it, did you, Shaun?'

208
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:12,508
- No.
- 'So...what is the plan, then?'

209
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,892
The Winchester?

210
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,690
- 'Hello?'
- Dianne, can you let me in?

211
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:29,691
- 'I'm not sure, Shaun.'
- Oh, come on.

212
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:32,410
'Lizzie doesn't want to see you.'

213
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:36,401
- Just open the door!
- 'She doesn't want to see you.'

214
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:41,532
Do you want me to climb up the wall,
come through the window? Because I will.

215
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,578
'You're not coming in.'

216
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,085
- OK, see you in a minute.
- 'Don't...'

217
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,761
'Hi, it's me again.'

218
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:02,480
Can we just talk about this? Let's go out.

219
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:05,054
- To the Winchester?
- Do you want to?

220
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:08,104
- No, I don't fucking want to!
- OK.

221
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:10,394
It's not the only place in the world.

222
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,566
We'll go to the Shepherd's,
they do Thai in there.

223
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:16,534
- I'm going out with David and Di.
- Let's go together.

224
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:20,112
You hang out with my friends?
"A failed actress and a twat"?

225
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:23,829
That's harsh.
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.

226
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:28,541
Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things'll be fine, I promise.

227
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,581
You promised you'd stop smoking.

228
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,966
You promised you'd try drinking
red wine instead of beer!

229
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:37,510
- You promised we'd go on holiday.
- We went to Greece!

230
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:39,963
- We met in Greece.
- At a rave.

231
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:43,017
It's not the same.
You promised things would change.

232
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:46,513
- You promised us free cable.
- I'm working on that.

233
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:51,025
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don't need them.

234
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:53,026
W-What was the next one?

235
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:55,561
It's not enough, Shaun.

236
00:16:55,615 --> 00:17:00,407
'We appear to have
a breakdown in communication there.

237
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,157
'lf you or someone you know may...'

238
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:05,779
I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun.

239
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,707
Get fucked, four-eyes!

240
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,373
You go out with her, you love her so much.

241
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,543
What do you mean by that?

242
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:18,133
'..the devastation really is extensive.
It's a total mess.'

243
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,551
I don't know what he meant by that.

244
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,389
Got you these.

245
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:35,651
- "To a wonderful mum"?
- Oooh!

246
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:38,317
Yeah, that's because...

247
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:42,777
I thought it would be funny
because of what you said last night

248
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,663
about you don't want to be
my mum and that.

249
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:49,619
It's just a little joke,
just sort of spur of the moment.

250
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:53,794
- They're for your mum, aren't they?
- Yeah.

251
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,581
Smooth.

252
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:06,633
If I don't do something, I'll end up in that pub

253
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:10,099
for the rest of my life
like those other sad old fuckers

254
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:13,181
wondering what the hell happened.

255
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:15,473
What do you mean do something?

256
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:52,176
Fuck her. You got your pint.

257
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:55,394
You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?

258
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:59,769
Oh. You want your favourite monkey?

259
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:03,187
Shall I do Clyde?

260
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,081
See, I knew you'd get over her.

261
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:28,383
* If you leave me now... *

262
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:30,836
Who the hell put this on?

263
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,427
It's on random.

264
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:36,311
For fuck's sake. John, yes please, mate.

265
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:44,349
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.

266
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:46,395
A Bloody Mary first thing,

267
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,861
a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,

268
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:53,241
stagger back here and bang...
back at the bar for shots.

269
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:55,444
How's that for a slice of fried gold?

270
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:57,655
- No.
- Come on, man.

271
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:02,125
Talk to me.

272
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,665
She said if she stayed with me
she'd end up in here for the rest of her life

273
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:10,334
Iike these sad old fuckers
wondering what the hell happened.

274
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,259
That is harsh.

275
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:15,969
- These are rich, interesting characters.
- Like who?

276
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:23,225
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.

277
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,147
He's a bigamist.

278
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:28,276
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

279
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,608
And invented the mobile disco.

280
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:33,814
What about her, then?

281
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,440
Ooh! Cockacidal maniac.

282
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,405
She's an ex-porn star.

283
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:44,668
They say she starred in
the world's first interracial hardcore loop.

284
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,628
Cafe Au Lait...

285
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:50,245
Pour Vous.

286
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,673
Yeah. What about John, then?

287
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,804
He's North London Mafia.

288
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,923
It's true, Big Al says so.

289
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:01,892
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

290
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:06,147
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanour.

291
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,431
Bernie, the trophy wife.

292
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:11,319
He's connected.
Why is there a rifle above the bar?

293
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:14,896
- The pub's called the Winchester.
- Exactly.

294
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,901
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.

295
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,908
- Don't, man.
- No.

296
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:22,159
Oi, look at me.

297
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:26,913
Can I just say one thing? I'm not gonna
say there's plenty more fish in the sea,

298
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,450
I'm not gonna say if you love her let her go

299
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:34,842
and I'm not gonna bombard you with cliches
but what I will say is this...

300
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,757
it's not the end of the world.

301
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:44,841
Sorry, we're closed.

302
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:49,314
Pisshead.

303
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:56,610
* Ooh, white lines

304
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,612
* Visions, dreams of passion

305
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:00,863
* Going through my mind

306
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:03,530
* And all the while I think of you...

307
00:22:03,578 --> 00:22:05,321
Oh?

308
00:22:05,372 --> 00:22:08,787
What's the matter, love,
haven't you had your tea?

309
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:13,624
* Something of a phenomenon

00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:22,177

316
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:40,859
What? He should say base.

317
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:42,898
Or freeze.

318
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,609
What a tit.

00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,868
* You wanna dance? *

320
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,925
Don't scratch it! Wait...

321
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:11,973
- That was the second album I ever bought!
- It's four in the fucking morning!

322
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,141
- It's Saturday!
- No, it's not.

323
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:17,521
It's fucking Sunday
and I've got to go to fucking work

324
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:21,563
in four fucking hours
because every other fucker is fucking ill!

325
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:24,233
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?

326
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:26,190
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey! Pete, look,

327
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:31,911
I'm sorry, we had a couple of drinks,
we split up with Liz tonight.

328
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,036
Just keep it down, yeah?

329
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:38,621
Prick.

330
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,496
What was that?

331
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,041
Nothing.

332
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,383
- Stop it, we're friends!
- He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot.

333
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:50,091
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means why don't you fuck off!

334
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:53,887
You wanna live like an animal,
live in the shed, you thick fuck!

335
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:56,686
- Leave him alone!
- Stop defending him.

336
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,602
All he ever does is hold you back.

337
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:02,644
Or is it easier having someone around
who's more of a loser than you?

338
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:06,061
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.

339
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,864
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?

340
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,409
Sort your fucking life out, mate.

341
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,825
What's up with your hand, man?

342
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,408
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- By who?

343
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,544
- Some crackheads. One of them bit me.
- Why?

344
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,754
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them!

345
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,879
I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip hop isn't helping.

346
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,799
And the front door is open. Again!

347
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,514
It's not hip hop, it's electro. Prick.

348
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,183
Next time I see him, he's dead.

349
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,653
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today

- Ed, this is serious.

464
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:11,803
Liz!

465
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:15,268
- 'Shaun.'
- Mum! I was gonna call you. Are you OK?

466
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:17,390
- 'Yes.'
- Are you sure?

467
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,063
'Some men tried to get into the house.'

468
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:24,108
- Are they still there?
- 'I'm not sure. We shut the curtains.'

469
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:27,856
- Did you try the police?
- 'Well, I thought about it.'

470
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,409
- Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
- 'No, I'm fine.'

471
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:35,618
- Mum?
- 'Well...they were a bit bitey.'

472
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:41,494
- Mum, have you been bitten?
- 'No, but Philip has.'

473
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,540
- Oh, OK.
- Has she been bitten?

474
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:45,383
- No, Philip has.
- Oh, OK.

475
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:49,922
- Mum, what state is he in?
- 'He's fine. Bit under the weather.'

476
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:51,846
- I see.
- What's the deal?

477
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:56,268
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you're not safe there. I'm coming.

478
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:59,680
- 'I don't want to cause a fuss.'
- We're coming to get you, Barbara!

479
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:03,068
So, what's the plan?

480
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:06,940
Right.

481
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:10,694
'We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's,

482
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:14,158
'we go in, we take care of Philip.'

483
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,493
I'm so sorry, Philip.

484
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,077
'Then we grab Mum, go over to Liz's place,

486

'and wait for all this to blow over.'

487
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:27,251
- Why have we got to go to Liz's?
- Because we do.

488
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,087
- She dumped you.
- I have to know if she's all right.

489
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,674
- Why?
- Because I love her.

490
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,965
All right, gay.

491
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:38,472
- I'm not staying there, though.
- Why not?

492
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,473
If we hole up,
I want to be somewhere familiar,

493
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:45,566
I wanna know where the exits are
and I wanna be allowed to smoke.

494

OK...

497
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:53,944

No, wait, we can't bring them back here.

502
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:08,333
- Why not?
- It's not exactly safe, is it?

503
00:38:08,382 --> 00:38:10,339
Yeah. Look at the state of it.

504
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:14,167
Where's safe? Where's familiar?

505
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:15,798
Where can I smoke?

510
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:36,900

Do you believe everything you hear on TV?

Yeah, I can see it, it's just outside.

Any zombies out there?

517
00:38:56,428 --> 00:38:58,254
- Don't say that.
- What?

518
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,297
- That.
- What?

519
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:02,755
That. The Z word. Don't say it.

520
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,382
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.

521
00:39:05,437 --> 00:39:09,019
All right. Are there any out there, though?

522
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:14,393
Can't see any.
Maybe it's not as bad as all that.

523
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:16,520
Oh! No, there they are.

524

- OK, let's do this, yeah?
- Yeah?

525
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:23,360
Yeah! I got to do a wee first.

526

Ooh...can I drive?

527
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,074
What?

528
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:31,073
I always wanted to drive Pete's car.
I might not get another chance.

529
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:32,705
OK.

530
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,451
Ahh! Oh, God.

531
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:10,872
Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're gonna
borrow your car, OK?

532
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,991
Erm, we'll bring it back.

533
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:18,250
And if you're feeling better later,
we're...we're going to the pub.

00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:21,749
You're more than welcome to, er...

535

join us.

536
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:34,186
Pete'd be so pissed off
if he knew I was driving his car.

537
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,688
I don't think so.

538
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:40,974
Shaun, which button's central locking?

539

Oh, cock it!

540
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:51,069
Get lost!

541
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,967
Drive.

- He's gonna be dead either way.
- That's not the point.

Oh, thank God for that.

Ah, hello.

557

Who's a pretty boy then?

558
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:27,583
You didn't say Barbara had a Jag.
I've always wanted to drive a Jag.

559
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:30,003
It's Philip's. He won't let anybody near it.

and he chased me with a bit of wood.

What, what, what, what, what?

564
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:46,386
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems...

565
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,516
I'll honk three times.

566
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:49,730
OK.

567

Don't forget to kill Philip!

- Hello, pickle.
- Hi, Mum.

569

You've got red on you.

570
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:05,956
Yeah. Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?

571
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,408
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Where's Philip?

572
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,869
- Dad's in the lounge.
- He's not my dad.

573
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,251
Really!

574
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,789
Ed's outside,
we'll take you somewhere safe.

575
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,927
- What about the doctor?
- I don't think he's gonna come.

576
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:22,015
- Philip won't want to leave the house.
- Philip isn't...

577
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,975
Put the kettle on and I'll deal with Philip.

578
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,893
- OK.
- OK, then.

579
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,681
- You hungry?
- Not really.

580
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:31,139
- I'll make some sandwiches.
- OK.

587
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,502
- I'm so sorry, Philip.
- Why?

588
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,011
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.

589

- No. Yes.

Your toys are upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.

- I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
- What?

594
00:44:20,073 --> 00:44:23,192
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
- Don't be silly.

595
00:44:23,242 --> 00:44:25,993
Maybe you should stay here
and wait for the doctor.

596
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:29,405
- You said he wasn't coming.
- You didn't call the doctor?

597
00:44:29,457 --> 00:44:34,451
- Just to be on the safe side.
- I'm fine. I ran it under a cold tap.

598
00:44:34,503 --> 00:44:37,706
We had our jabs when
we went to the lsle of Wight.

- It's overblown nonsense.

- A lot of drug nuts running wild.
- But I should get Mum away.

601
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:48,012
- I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
- Mum, look!

602
00:44:48,058 --> 00:44:51,058
How about that tea?

603
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:55,016
Mum, how much do you love Philip?

604
00:44:55,065 --> 00:44:58,848
- Two sugars, is it?
- I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.

605
00:44:58,902 --> 00:45:01,357
Oh, yes. Will you cut me some bread, love?

606
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:04,737
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?

607
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:07,355
Do we have to go through all that again?

608
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,573
What would you say if I told you
that Philip's been quite unkind to me?

609
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:13,614
You weren't easy to live with.

610
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:17,330
- He chased me with a bit of wood!
- You did call him a you-know-what.

611
00:45:17,378 --> 00:45:20,331
- Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.
- Shaun!

612
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:22,373
Sorry, Mother... Mum!

613
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:27,050
Did you know that on several occasions...
he touched me?

614
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:36,053
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.

615
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:39,389
- You don't understand...
- No, you don't understand.

616
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:42,394
Philip is my husband
and has been for 1 7 years

617
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:46,061
and I would at least expect you
to respect my feelings.

618
00:45:46,114 --> 00:45:48,865
You must be more adult about these things.

619
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:50,817
Yeah.

620
00:45:50,868 --> 00:45:55,079
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when...

621
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:58,572
you just...

622
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:00,701
gotta be a man.

623
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:10,541
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.

624
00:46:10,596 --> 00:46:12,553
Hello, Edward.

625
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:15,134
- Hi, Barbara.
- My, how you've grown.

626
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:18,634
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?

627
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:22,351
- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?

628
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:26,017
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?

629
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:29,105
Hmm...I pranged it.

630
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:30,814
You were parked.

631
00:46:30,865 --> 00:46:32,691
Yeah.

632
00:46:32,742 --> 00:46:35,279
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.

633
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:39,159
- Philip?
- What?

634
00:46:39,206 --> 00:46:41,281
Look out!

635
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:44,875
Christ!

636
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:56,013
- Give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.

637
00:46:56,056 --> 00:46:59,259
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.

638
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,550
I'm on it.

639
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:04,556
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.

640
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,940
- Maybe I should drive.
- I've adjusted the seat now.

641
00:47:08,985 --> 00:47:10,811
Just be careful!

642
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,415
Can you please turn that noise down?

643
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:29,369
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

644
00:47:29,421 --> 00:47:32,872
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.

645
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:35,131
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.

646
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:40,341
You do realise this is
a 20 mile an hour zone?

647
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,967
Oh, yeah.

648
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:47,509
- Here.
- Mum, this won't take a second, all right?

649
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,229
- Have you still got the child locks on?
- Safety first, Shaun.

650
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,355
You can't...

651
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:01,362
Hey, man, watch the leather.

652
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:06,741
Keep moving. If there's any problems...

653
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:09,116
I'll do the honks.

654
00:48:33,212 --> 00:48:35,287
'Hello?'

655
00:48:37,174 --> 00:48:39,801
Hello?

656
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,740
- Guys, can you let me in?
- What are you doing?

657
00:49:03,783 --> 00:49:06,570
I've come to get you.

658
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:22,716
- What are you doing?
- I've come to take you somewhere safe.

659
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,966
- We were safe!
- You don't know that.

660
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:28,131
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?

661
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:29,426
- Lots.
- Lots!

662
00:49:29,475 --> 00:49:32,428
It only takes one of them
to know you're in here.

663
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:36,225
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.

664
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,772
- Oh, you made a plan?
- We have to get out of here.

665
00:49:39,818 --> 00:49:42,487
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.

666
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:45,399
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.

667
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:48,318
- Shaun...
- This is not about you and me.

668
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:50,407
This is about survival.

669
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:54,450
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere we can stay alive.

670
00:49:54,499 --> 00:49:56,740
- We're with you, Shaun.
- What?

671
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:59,543
- We're with you.
- I'm not going out there.

672
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:04,003
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces
and if you think about it, neither do you.

673
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:06,799
- I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
- She's going.

674
00:50:06,842 --> 00:50:09,047
- I'm not staying by myself.
- You're going, aren't you?

675
00:50:09,094 --> 00:50:11,169
- Lizzie?
- Liz?

676
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:19,264
- All right, Flash, what's your plan?
- Great. I've got a car

677
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,009
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?

678
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,102
- Yes!
- Great. Where?

679
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:28,017
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.

680
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,311
David?

681
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,940
I don't see the point
of owning a car in London.

682
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:35,738
Look, just get any blunt objects together.

683
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:38,615
If you get cornered,
bash them in the head.

684
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:41,409
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.

685
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:43,859
So, what's the plan, then?

686
00:50:43,912 --> 00:50:46,283
We're going to the Winchester.

687
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,206
OK? Let's go.

688
00:51:08,305 --> 00:51:10,427
- Come on.
- Where's the car?

689
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:17,182
What's up, niggaz?

690
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:25,936
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.

691
00:51:25,985 --> 00:51:29,068
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.

692
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:31,400
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.

693
00:51:31,448 --> 00:51:33,356
Hello.

694
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:41,781
Ed, be careful.

695
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,987
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.

696
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,530
- He's bleeding.
- I know! Ed, be careful.

697
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:49,288
Thought you wanted to get there fast?

698
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,918
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?

699
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:55,039
Chill out, it's a short cut.

700
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:58,173
- That road goes to the Winchester.
- Shaun...

701
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:02,546
- Liz, please!
- I don't understand why the Winchester?

702
00:52:02,596 --> 00:52:05,761
- It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
- They know us.

703
00:52:05,807 --> 00:52:09,886
- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.

704
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:11,843
And there's a rifle above the bar.

705
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:16,555
- I would think that's deactivated.
- It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.

706
00:52:16,606 --> 00:52:18,728
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

707
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:20,268
- They can't.
- Can't they?

708
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:22,440
- Of course they can!
- Are you sure?

709
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:26,019
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.

710
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:28,526
- Shaun...
- I turned it off, all right?

711
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:30,779
What?

712
00:52:30,826 --> 00:52:34,158
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?

713
00:52:34,703 --> 00:52:39,079
You were 12 when I met you,
you'd already grown up so much.

714
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:45,159
I just wanted you to be strong
and not give up because you lost your dad.

715
00:52:46,254 --> 00:52:51,792
- Philip, you don't have to explain.
- No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.

716
00:52:51,841 --> 00:52:56,632
And I always thought
you had it in you to do well.

717
00:52:56,678 --> 00:53:01,006
You just need...m-motivation.

718
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:03,629
Somebody to look up to and...

719
00:53:06,644 --> 00:53:08,719
I thought it could be me.

720
00:53:10,272 --> 00:53:13,272
Would you just...take care of your mum?

721
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,024
There's a good boy.

722
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:24,609
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.

723
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:29,947
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

724
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:32,911
- Just pull over!
- All right.

725
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:40,001
Whoa, momma!

726
00:53:40,044 --> 00:53:43,494
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.

727
00:53:43,547 --> 00:53:45,704
Stop telling me to chill out!

728
00:53:46,716 --> 00:53:50,297
- And everybody is not all right.
- What's wrong?

729
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,964
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.

730
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:55,584
- Where's he gone?
- Mum, he's dead.

731
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,928
No, he isn't.

732
00:53:58,975 --> 00:54:00,967
Get out!

733
00:54:02,394 --> 00:54:04,682
Jesus!

734
00:54:04,729 --> 00:54:08,013
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!

735
00:54:08,065 --> 00:54:10,140
Quick!

736
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:14,561
- The child lock!
- Ed!

737
00:54:34,377 --> 00:54:36,534
- Now what?
- We keep moving.

738
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:40,370
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven't got time.

739
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:43,174
- We can't leave your dad.
- He's not my dad!

740
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:45,256
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.

741
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:49,761
- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?

742
00:54:49,805 --> 00:54:54,181
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.

743
00:54:56,518 --> 00:54:58,640
Let's go, shall we?

744
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:01,011
You're not suggesting we walk?

745
00:55:04,274 --> 00:55:06,846
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

746
00:55:07,277 --> 00:55:10,479
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?

747
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:12,568
Do you know where we're going?

748
00:55:12,614 --> 00:55:15,104
- David, come on.
- Sorry.

749
00:55:15,157 --> 00:55:17,564
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.

750
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,195
Are we close?

751
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:27,410
We're pretty close.

752
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:30,374
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.

753
00:55:30,419 --> 00:55:33,335
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.

754
00:55:33,379 --> 00:55:36,379
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.

755
00:55:36,423 --> 00:55:39,506
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...

756
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:42,337
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.

757
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:45,302
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...

758
00:55:45,347 --> 00:55:50,766
You're not just trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.

759
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:56,393
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.

760
00:55:57,481 --> 00:55:59,105
Shaun.

761
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,607
Yvonne.

762
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,436
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.

763
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,057
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.

764
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,819
Hey, Yvonne.

765
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,733
Erm...this is my boyfriend, Declan.

766
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:12,858
Erm...my friends Mark, Maggie,

767
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:16,407
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
- All right.

768
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:18,991
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

769
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:22,039
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?

770
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:24,240
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

771
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:27,328
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?

772
00:56:27,378 --> 00:56:30,911
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?

773
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,585
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

774
00:56:41,472 --> 00:56:43,262
Hi.

775
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:44,800
Hello.

776
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,964
Hi.

777
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:47,807
Hello.

778
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:49,511
All right.

779
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,802
See? The Winchester's just over there.

780
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:57,181
- Over where?
- Over there.

781
00:56:57,234 --> 00:56:59,806
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

782
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:01,687
What's the matter, David?

783
00:57:02,196 --> 00:57:04,401
Never taken a short cut before?

784
00:57:21,252 --> 00:57:22,911
Shaun.

785
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:25,748
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.

786
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:43,928
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?

787
00:57:43,978 --> 00:57:47,262
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?

788
00:57:47,314 --> 00:57:50,978
- One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
- There's six of us.

789
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:53,313
Mum!

790
00:57:56,028 --> 00:57:58,103
I'm coming!

791
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:00,859
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?

792
00:58:00,907 --> 00:58:03,741
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

793
00:58:07,537 --> 00:58:10,109
Shaun?

794
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:13,370
Are you all right?

795
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:33,472
What are you doing?

796
00:58:35,558 --> 00:58:37,633
Shaun!

797
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:42,430
Yes!

798
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:46,306
No, that's rubbish.

799
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,985
- Ooh!
- Yes!

800
00:58:57,741 --> 00:59:00,065
Feel free to step in any time.

801
00:59:00,118 --> 00:59:03,237
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

802
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:05,444
I'm so sorry about that.

803
00:59:07,249 --> 00:59:09,371
Right.

804
00:59:10,668 --> 00:59:15,459
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

805
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:26,378
- Is it clear?
- No.

806
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,587
- How many?
- Lots.

807
00:59:38,772 --> 00:59:41,807
Oh, well, that is just great.

808
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:44,063
There are a fair few of them, yes.

809
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:47,478
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

810
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:49,734
This is hardly constructive, David!

811
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:53,612
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?

812
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:58,035
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.

813
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,494
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.

814
01:00:09,462 --> 01:00:12,088
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.

815
01:00:12,089 --> 01:00:14,661
Or not.

816
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:19,297
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

817
01:00:19,345 --> 01:00:24,848
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.

818
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,178
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

819
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:29,300
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.

820
01:00:33,105 --> 01:00:37,315
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.

821
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:39,848
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

822
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:42,653
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.

823
01:00:42,695 --> 01:00:44,687
- Come on!
- Urgh.

824
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:48,154
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.

825
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,942
Uuurgh.

826
01:00:49,993 --> 01:00:52,946
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.

827
01:00:52,995 --> 01:00:55,319
This is the night!

828
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:57,779
- What is that?
- What about yours?

829
01:00:57,832 --> 01:01:00,832
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

830
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:02,535
Don't...

831
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:07,246
Yeah, that's pretty good.

832
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:13,214
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.

833
01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:09,417
Go, go, go, go.

834
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:14,169
Shit! Get round me, get round me!

835
01:02:14,223 --> 01:02:18,682
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

836
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,848
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

837
01:02:21,895 --> 01:02:23,436
- They know.
- Stay in character!

838
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,729
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

839
01:02:26,774 --> 01:02:29,394
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!

840
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:32,228
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?

841
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:34,317
Yeah, there's...

842
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:37,812
Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.

843
01:02:37,865 --> 01:02:40,616
- 'All right?'
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.

844
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:43,528
- 'You get anything yet?'
- I got nothing.

845
01:02:43,578 --> 01:02:46,531
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.

846
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,446
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.

847
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,072
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!

848
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:56,660
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life...

849
01:02:56,713 --> 01:02:59,962
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you

850
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:03,291
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.

851
01:03:03,343 --> 01:03:06,462
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!

852
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:08,504
Shaun.

853
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:09,835
Oh.

854
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:20,062
You were saying about another way in?

855
01:03:20,105 --> 01:03:22,227
Yeah, there's a...

856
01:03:22,274 --> 01:03:24,894
What are you doing?

857
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:29,317
- No!
- Get inside.

858
01:03:29,362 --> 01:03:33,145
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.

859
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,195
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!

860
01:03:37,243 --> 01:03:41,405
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!

861
01:03:41,455 --> 01:03:44,490
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.

862
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:47,541
- Wait till I've gone then get inside.
- Gone where?

863
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:53,418
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.

864
01:03:53,464 --> 01:03:56,914
Come on, this way, that's it!

865
01:03:56,967 --> 01:04:00,880
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

866
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:04,509
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.

867
01:04:04,556 --> 01:04:06,761
All you can eat!

868
01:04:06,807 --> 01:04:08,882
Shall we go in, then?

869
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:20,598
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

870
01:04:40,499 --> 01:04:43,250
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- 17.

871
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:48,915
Either way, we need to think about blocking
up this window. We're totally exposed.

872
01:04:48,964 --> 01:04:52,545
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

873
01:04:54,218 --> 01:04:57,171
- Let's get some lights on.
- David, wait!

874
01:04:58,513 --> 01:05:01,085
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

875
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,590
- We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
- No, of course not.

876
01:05:04,642 --> 01:05:08,638
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.

877
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:10,679
I'm just being proactive.

878
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:15,141
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.

879
01:05:15,192 --> 01:05:18,856
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!

880
01:05:18,903 --> 01:05:22,816
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody
has to take control of the situation

881
01:05:22,864 --> 01:05:27,192
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

882
01:05:27,243 --> 01:05:30,408
then perhaps...I should.

883
01:05:30,454 --> 01:05:33,869
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- He'll be back soon.

884
01:05:33,914 --> 01:05:36,830
- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.

885
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:43,125
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?

886
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:47,796
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot
is also an impenetrable fortress.

887
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:50,961
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

888
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,631
I could get a round in.

889
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,462
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade
the window when he gets back.

890
01:05:57,516 --> 01:06:00,599
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

891
01:06:00,643 --> 01:06:02,848
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!

892
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:06,512
- There's a Breville out back.
- Great. Saved by nibbles.

893
01:06:06,564 --> 01:06:08,888
Must be why Shaun took us here
before he left.

894
01:06:08,941 --> 01:06:13,068
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

895
01:06:13,111 --> 01:06:18,186
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?

896
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,404
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?

897
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:26,027
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.

898
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,656
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.

899
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:35,328
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

900
01:06:35,377 --> 01:06:38,496
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?

901
01:06:38,546 --> 01:06:40,751
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.

902
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:44,462
We'll have a party
and get completely smashed.

903
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:48,256
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.

904
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:51,885
- David!
- We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.

905
01:06:57,269 --> 01:06:58,846
Pickle!

906
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:00,637
Hello, Mum. You all right?

907
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:02,763
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

908
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:05,056
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- No.

909
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,349
- Check upstairs?
- It's locked.

910
01:07:07,401 --> 01:07:09,938
- Phones?
- Dead. Same as the power.

911
01:07:09,987 --> 01:07:14,030
- OK...
- Nice of you to join us.

912
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:16,693
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't l?

913
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:25,323
How did you lose them?

914
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:30,580
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.

915
01:07:30,627 --> 01:07:33,413
- Well, how did you get in?
- The back door.

916
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,953
I tried to tell you
before you smashed the window.

917
01:07:36,006 --> 01:07:39,374
But it wasn't me blowing our cover
by arguing with my boyfriend.

918
01:07:39,425 --> 01:07:43,208
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

919
01:07:43,262 --> 01:07:45,384
Thanks, babe.

920
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:48,881
So, what's the plan, then?

921
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:53,560
Would anyone like a peanut?

922
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:05,774
Why don't you do your Clyde?

923
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,855
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?

924
01:08:08,906 --> 01:08:11,859
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orang-utan.

925
01:08:11,908 --> 01:08:14,612
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

926
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,494
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on.

927
01:08:17,537 --> 01:08:20,702
- You've built it up too much.
- No, just do it.

928
01:08:20,748 --> 01:08:23,664
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

929
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:26,281
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.

930
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,458
I'm not a performing monkey.

931
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:34,291
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

932
01:08:34,342 --> 01:08:38,290
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.

933
01:08:38,345 --> 01:08:42,176
- What about the lights?
- Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.

934
01:08:42,223 --> 01:08:46,054
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.

935
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:48,472
It's quite simple, David.

936
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:19,041
- Is that it?
- That's it.

937
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:48,768
Liz, erm...have you got a quid?

938
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:51,730
Erm...

939
01:09:53,693 --> 01:09:55,317
Yeah.

940
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:02,152
Never anything on, is there?

941
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,535
What?

942
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:14,618
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?

943
01:10:18,587 --> 01:10:22,453
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.

944
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:24,877
Yeah.

945
01:10:24,925 --> 01:10:29,550
Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet then, won't we?

946
01:10:30,971 --> 01:10:33,046
What?

947
01:10:34,849 --> 01:10:37,303
Ed, no!

948
01:10:37,351 --> 01:10:39,473
Turn it off!

949
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,916
Shit!

950
01:11:12,961 --> 01:11:15,665
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I dunno.

951
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,626
- Who put this on?
- It's on random.

952
01:11:22,677 --> 01:11:25,926
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

953
01:11:25,971 --> 01:11:27,761
- What?!
- The jukebox!

954
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:30,510
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?

955
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:32,633
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

956
01:11:32,684 --> 01:11:36,182
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.

957
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:39,312
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

958
01:11:39,356 --> 01:11:41,312
How about pool?

959
01:11:41,357 --> 01:11:44,689
* Don't stop me now

960
01:11:44,735 --> 01:11:46,727
* Don't stop me

961
01:11:46,778 --> 01:11:50,027
- * Cos I'm having... *
- John, it's time at the bar.

962
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:53,903
* I'm a shooting star
leaping through the sky like a tiger

963
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:57,567
* Defying the laws of gravity

964
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:01,912
* I'm a racing car passing by
like Lady Godiva

965
01:12:01,956 --> 01:12:04,410
* I'm gonna go, go, go

966
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:06,995
* There's no stopping me

967
01:12:07,043 --> 01:12:09,331
* I'm burning through the sky...

968
01:12:09,379 --> 01:12:12,295
- I can't find the switches!
- Then get the fuses!

969
01:12:12,714 --> 01:12:14,670
* That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit

970
01:12:14,716 --> 01:12:16,921
* I'm travelling at the speed of light

971
01:12:16,968 --> 01:12:20,881
* I wanna make
a supersonic man out of you

972
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:23,051
* Don't stop me now

973
01:12:23,097 --> 01:12:25,219
* I'm having such a good time

974
01:12:25,265 --> 01:12:27,340
* I'm having a ball

975
01:12:27,392 --> 01:12:29,300
* Don't stop me now

976
01:12:29,352 --> 01:12:31,509
* If you wanna have a good time

977
01:12:31,562 --> 01:12:33,435
* Just give me a call

978
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,100
* Don't stop me now
cos I'm having a good time

979
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:38,022
* Don't stop me now

980
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:43,819
* Yes I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

981
01:12:43,863 --> 01:12:47,906
- * I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars...
- Why is Queen still on?

982
01:12:47,949 --> 01:12:50,486
- We have a situation!
- I know!

983
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:53,860
- Fuck this. Two seconds.
- Ed!

984
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:55,536
Oi!

985
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:00,406
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

986
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:03,578
* I'm burning through the sky, yeah...

987
01:13:03,628 --> 01:13:05,454
Shaun!

988
01:13:05,504 --> 01:13:07,661
*..call me Mister Fahrenheit...

989
01:13:07,714 --> 01:13:09,255
No!

990
01:13:11,175 --> 01:13:13,463
Yes! Yes! In the head!

991
01:13:16,262 --> 01:13:18,135
Ooow!

992
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,757
Shauny!

993
01:13:19,806 --> 01:13:21,963
* Don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

994
01:13:22,016 --> 01:13:25,964
* Don't stop me, don't stop me
good time, good time

995
01:13:26,019 --> 01:13:27,975
* Don't stop me... *

996
01:13:35,652 --> 01:13:38,059
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?

997
01:13:39,488 --> 01:13:41,729
Ed, for the last time, it's...

998
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:49,571
I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.

999
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:51,494
OK.

1000
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:57,205
But dogs can look up.

1001
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,492
- Has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.

1002
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,879
- Apart from Ed?
- I'm a pacifist.

1003
01:14:04,924 --> 01:14:07,758
- Apart from David and Ed?
- What was Ed's experience?

1004
01:14:07,801 --> 01:14:11,133
- He shot his sister in the leg.
- I think you should do it.

1005
01:14:11,178 --> 01:14:14,427
- We should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?

1006
01:14:14,473 --> 01:14:17,426
- No one has any experience. We've got...
- 29.

1007
01:14:17,475 --> 01:14:19,514
- 29 bullets.
- Call them shells.

1008
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,679
29 shells. I need someone
to help me reload,

1009
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:25,266
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

1010
01:14:25,314 --> 01:14:30,354
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing
that will redeem mankind is co-operation.

1011
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:32,558
I think we can all appreciate that now.

1012
01:14:32,611 --> 01:14:36,275
- Was that on a beer mat?
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

1013
01:14:36,322 --> 01:14:38,230
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1014
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:43,032
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

1015
01:14:43,077 --> 01:14:46,776
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1016
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,364
- Barbara.
- Oh, hello.

1017
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:54,500
- Would you like to come with me?
- That'd be lovely.

1018
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:01,209
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.

1019
01:15:01,258 --> 01:15:03,333
- Really?
- Yeah.

1020
01:15:03,384 --> 01:15:05,376
- Ah!
- Barbara?

1021
01:15:06,804 --> 01:15:09,376
Are you all right?

1022
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:11,304
I've got something for you.

1023
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:16,174
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1024
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:19,808
- I'd like you to have it.
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...

1025
01:15:19,855 --> 01:15:22,855
It seems only right.

1026
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,199
I didn't want to say anything.

1027
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:41,450
I thought Shaun would be worried.

1028
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:44,990
Liz!

1029
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,831
Here they come!

1030
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,456
- Stay behind me!
- There's one!

1031
01:15:50,503 --> 01:15:52,957
Sorry, we're closed!

1032
01:15:53,005 --> 01:15:55,329
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.

1033
01:15:55,382 --> 01:15:57,539
Cock it!

1034
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,470
- There!
- Where?

1035
01:16:06,515 --> 01:16:08,507
Three o'clock!

1036
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:17,435
- Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
- What?

1037
01:16:17,482 --> 01:16:19,639
- 11:45!
- Keep it simple!

1038
01:16:20,818 --> 01:16:22,644
Top left!

1039
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:27,026
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1040
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:29,194
Come on, come on.

1041
01:16:32,618 --> 01:16:34,444
Nice shot.

1042
01:16:34,495 --> 01:16:37,163
OK, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1043
01:16:37,205 --> 01:16:39,410
Ed, take over a sec.

1044
01:16:39,498 --> 01:16:42,124
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1045
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:46,993
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1046
01:16:49,923 --> 01:16:53,373
- Mum, I don't understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.

1047
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:56,674
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1048
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,803
No, you should've said.

1049
01:16:59,847 --> 01:17:03,012
- Take over a sec.
- What's going on?

1050
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:05,548
- What's up?
- What the hell's going on?

1051
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:08,850
- Barbara's hurt!
- Just take over a minute.

1052
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:10,803
Jesus.

1053
01:17:10,855 --> 01:17:12,977
I know first aid.

1054
01:17:13,024 --> 01:17:15,977
Just hang on. Mum!

1055
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:18,516
- Mum.
- Is she...?

1056
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:20,893
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1057
01:17:20,946 --> 01:17:24,111
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1058
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,363
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1059
01:17:31,329 --> 01:17:34,115
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1060
01:17:35,165 --> 01:17:38,081
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.

1061
01:17:38,126 --> 01:17:40,331
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1062
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:42,748
Mum. Please don't go.

1063
01:17:54,305 --> 01:17:57,305
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1064
01:17:57,349 --> 01:17:59,969
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1065
01:18:00,017 --> 01:18:02,388
- She's gonna come back!
- She's not going anywhere.

1066
01:18:02,436 --> 01:18:04,843
- She'll change.
- She's my mum!

1067
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:07,647
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that.

1068
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,061
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.

1069
01:18:11,109 --> 01:18:13,184
One...

1070
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:14,693
two...

1071
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:15,981
three!

1072
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,815
- Don't point that gun at my mum!
- Calm down.

1073
01:18:18,865 --> 01:18:21,402
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1074
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:23,904
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What's that mean?

1075
01:18:23,952 --> 01:18:26,323
- This isn't exactly fair.
- Here.

1076
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:28,243
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1077
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:32,414
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1078
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,331
Tell him to put the gun down!

1079
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,617
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.

1080
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:42,007
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.

1081
01:18:42,049 --> 01:18:45,333
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!

1082
01:18:45,385 --> 01:18:47,875
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum.

1083
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:51,675
- She's not...
- You've never thought I was good enough.

1084
01:18:51,723 --> 01:18:54,972
- What?
- We all know you're in love with Liz.

1085
01:18:55,017 --> 01:18:57,471
- That is not true.
- Yes it is!

1086
01:18:57,519 --> 01:18:59,558
- That is not true.
- Yes it is.

1087
01:18:59,604 --> 01:19:02,308
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me

1088
01:19:02,356 --> 01:19:07,349
to get close to Liz and when she knocked
you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.

1089
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:11,148
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1090
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:14,564
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you...

1091
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:18,777
David! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here.

1092
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:22,988
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".

1093
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:26,121
- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.

1094
01:19:26,165 --> 01:19:28,287
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.

1095
01:19:28,334 --> 01:19:31,085
You've gone from
a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.

1096
01:19:31,127 --> 01:19:32,953
I'm not a chartered accountant.

1097
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:35,209
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.

1098
01:19:35,255 --> 01:19:38,290
- I'm a lecturer.
- You're a twat.

1099
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:42,040
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.

1100
01:19:42,094 --> 01:19:45,296
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1101
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:49,294
Please can we just calm the fuck down!

1102
01:19:50,892 --> 01:19:54,509
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1103
01:19:54,562 --> 01:19:56,850
- Thank you.
- Even if he is being a twat.

1104
01:19:56,897 --> 01:19:58,723
Yep.

1105
01:19:58,773 --> 01:20:01,689
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.

1106
01:20:04,444 --> 01:20:08,061
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you

1107
01:20:08,114 --> 01:20:10,568
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1108
01:20:11,741 --> 01:20:14,575
Shaun, babe...

1109
01:20:14,618 --> 01:20:17,653
I know you don't wanna hear this...

1110
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:38,085
You do it.

1111
01:20:48,019 --> 01:20:50,141
I'm sorry, Mum.

1112
01:20:51,521 --> 01:20:53,892
Do it!

1113
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:13,409
Well...I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1114
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:21,449
David, no!

1115
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:23,664
David!

1116
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:26,380
- Right, I'm leaving.
- What?

1117
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,953
- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.

1118
01:21:30,717 --> 01:21:34,167
- I think you should go.
- We will. We can defend ourselves.

1119
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,674
- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?

1120
01:21:36,722 --> 01:21:40,588
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.

1121
01:21:40,641 --> 01:21:43,048
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...

1122
01:21:43,102 --> 01:21:45,390
- After where he led us?
- Let me finish!

1123
01:21:45,437 --> 01:21:49,564
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.

1124
01:21:49,607 --> 01:21:52,393
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...

1125
01:21:52,442 --> 01:21:54,315
David!

1126
01:22:01,824 --> 01:22:03,946
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1127
01:22:03,992 --> 01:22:08,071
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

1128
01:22:10,581 --> 01:22:12,537
Shaun...

1129
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:19,625
David! No!

1130
01:22:19,671 --> 01:22:21,995
No! No! No!

1131
01:22:23,799 --> 01:22:25,755
David!

1132
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:28,506
- No! No!
- David!

1133
01:22:49,402 --> 01:22:51,559
David!

1134
01:22:52,237 --> 01:22:53,944
Dianne, no!

1135
01:22:53,988 --> 01:22:55,612
I'm coming, David!

1136
01:22:58,909 --> 01:23:01,363
David!

1137
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:03,284
Oh dear.

1138
01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:05,534
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1139
01:23:16,464 --> 01:23:18,206
Stay back!

1140
01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:25,211
Shaun, hold them!

1141
01:23:28,389 --> 01:23:30,215
Heads!

1142
01:23:34,102 --> 01:23:36,010
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1143
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:40,220
Shauny, look who it is.

1144
01:23:40,273 --> 01:23:42,845
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1145
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:46,060
Ed!

1146
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:48,067
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1147
01:23:48,112 --> 01:23:50,104
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1148
01:23:50,156 --> 01:23:51,982
I can't hold them!

1149
01:23:55,618 --> 01:23:57,028
No!

1150
01:24:01,122 --> 01:24:02,912
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1151
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:06,991
I said leave him alone!

1152
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:13,129
Ed. Ed!

1153
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:16,256
Shaun, bar!

1154
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:29,223
Ed!

1155
01:24:30,061 --> 01:24:31,969
Ed!

1156
01:24:32,604 --> 01:24:35,272
Ed!

1157
01:24:35,314 --> 01:24:37,222
What?

1158
01:24:37,274 --> 01:24:39,515
Chuck us a cloth, will you?

1159
01:24:52,703 --> 01:24:55,193
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1160
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:57,783
Oh, fuck.

1161
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:00,080
Ow!

1162
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:01,749
Fuck it!

1163
01:25:01,793 --> 01:25:04,709
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1164
01:25:04,753 --> 01:25:07,243
- The cellar.
- Maybe we can get out!

1165
01:25:07,297 --> 01:25:12,253
- There's a hatch out on to the street.
- You mean go back outside?

1166
01:25:12,301 --> 01:25:15,135
Oh, give us a fucking break!

1167
01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:23,340
Go!

1168
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:35,104
I can see the street.

1169
01:25:36,194 --> 01:25:37,568
Come on.

1170
01:25:38,987 --> 01:25:41,062
Come on!

1171
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:44,616
Why won't it open?

1172
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,827
That's it then, we're trapped.
"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"

1173
01:25:58,877 --> 01:26:00,785
Whose fucking idea was that?

1174
01:26:00,837 --> 01:26:03,671
Man, I've really ballsed this up.

1175
01:26:07,134 --> 01:26:10,798
- No, you haven't.
- I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.

1176
01:26:10,845 --> 01:26:15,636
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save Mum. I'm useless.

1177
01:26:15,682 --> 01:26:21,350
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that's what counts.

1178
01:26:23,354 --> 01:26:25,429
Yeah, I suppose.

1179
01:26:27,941 --> 01:26:30,692
Do you think they'll get through?

1180
01:26:30,735 --> 01:26:32,608
Yeah.

1181
01:26:34,029 --> 01:26:36,270
How many shells have we got left?

1182
01:26:36,322 --> 01:26:39,487
Erm...two.

1183
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:44,656
I suppose we could take a few of them out
if they stand in a line.

1184
01:26:44,703 --> 01:26:46,908
I wasn't thinking about them.

1185
01:26:46,955 --> 01:26:48,697
I know.

1186
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:58,335
- What about Ed? There's only two shells.
- I don't mind being eaten.

1187
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:04,629
How are we gonna do this?

1188
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:07,381
I don't know. Erm...

1189
01:27:07,429 --> 01:27:09,504
One of us has to go first.

1190
01:27:09,555 --> 01:27:12,757
One should do the other
and then do themselves.

1191
01:27:12,808 --> 01:27:15,843
You should do me.
I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.

1192
01:27:24,942 --> 01:27:28,310
I don't think I've got it in me
to shoot my flatmate,

1193
01:27:28,361 --> 01:27:31,776
my mum and my girlfriend
all in the same evening.

1194
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:35,356
What makes you think I've taken you back?

1195
01:27:35,408 --> 01:27:37,281
Well...

1196
01:27:38,369 --> 01:27:40,740
you don't want to die single, do you?

1197
01:27:40,787 --> 01:27:44,570
Actually...I would like to be shot.

1198
01:27:45,624 --> 01:27:50,035
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag
since yesterday, I promise.

1199
01:27:50,086 --> 01:27:52,208
He hasn't.

1200
01:27:53,922 --> 01:27:56,246
Maybe we should have one now.

1201
01:27:59,551 --> 01:28:02,586
- You left them in my flat.
- Yeah, in the bin.

1202
01:28:02,637 --> 01:28:05,672
- I was desperate.
- Sneaky monkey.

1203
01:28:05,723 --> 01:28:08,972
- Sorry.
- I won't say anything.

1204
01:28:21,318 --> 01:28:23,725
Come on, we're getting out of here.

1205
01:28:24,737 --> 01:28:27,737
- I might just stay here.
- But we can get out.

1206
01:28:27,781 --> 01:28:31,314
- You two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?

1207
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:34,735
- I only hold you back.
- Yeah, but...

1208
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,621
Maybe you should have this.

1209
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,702
- Don't you want it?
- No.

1210
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:48,706
I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.

1211
01:28:52,133 --> 01:28:55,631
- Ed, I'm sorry.
- What for?

1212
01:28:55,677 --> 01:29:00,503
- Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
- It's all right.

1213
01:29:00,556 --> 01:29:02,880
I'm sorry too.

1214
01:29:02,932 --> 01:29:05,007
It's OK.

1215
01:29:05,059 --> 01:29:06,801
No...

1216
01:29:06,852 --> 01:29:08,927
I'm sorry, Shaun.

1217
01:29:11,772 --> 01:29:15,021
Oh, God! That's not funny.

1218
01:29:15,067 --> 01:29:19,976
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I'm not laughing.

1219
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,370
You'd better be off.

1220
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,454
Bye, Ed. Love you.

1221
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,923
Cheers.

1222
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,001
I love you too, man.

1223
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,255
Gay.

1224
01:30:18,156 --> 01:30:20,563
- Ready?
- Ready.

1225
01:30:30,331 --> 01:30:32,738
Section One. Ready.

1226
01:30:32,792 --> 01:30:35,080
Zombies to your front. Fire!

1227
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,504
Fire!

1228
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:57,678
