可怜的小家伙

母鹿们自己都难养活

20
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,884
也许你可以

{\fs12}The distance\nmakes it easier to spot danger.{\r}

75
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:42,423
但这样就没法和他们玩了
{\fs12}But it sure makes it\nharder to play with them.{\r}

76
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,868

- 小羊跑过来要和我玩  - 斑比　　　　　　　
{\fs12}- A fawn came over and wanted to play...  - Bambi.{\r}

80
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,114
还是让以往的过去吧
{\fs12}l think it's best\nto leave the past in the past.{\r}

81
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:07,851
王子应该展望未来，而不是回顾往昔
{\fs12}A prince does not look back,\nonly ahead.{\r}

82
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:10,120
遵命，先生

来吧，咱们还要去很多地方呢
{\fs12}Now, come.\nWe still have a lot of ground to cover today.{\r}

84
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,896
别落远了

怎么啦?
{\fs12}What's wrong?{\r}

88
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,401
她们老追着我吖

呃
{\fs12}Uh-uh.{\r}

00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:26,364
他躲在后面呐 瞧，瞧
{\fs12}l think he's over there.\nLook, look.{\r}

95
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:31,141
哦 好吧
{\fs12}Oh, OK.{\r}

96
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,803
那咱们走吧
{\fs12}l guess we will be leaving, then.{\r}

97
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,146
- 抓到了!
{\fs12}- Gotcha!\n- Argh!{\r}

98
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,383
妈妈要你带我们去看鼠鼠
{\fs12}Mama says you're gonna\ntake us to see the groundhog.{\r}

99
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:47,287
她说去吧
{\fs12}What she says goes.{\r}

100
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,622
妈妈又不是老大
{\fs12}Well, she's not the boss of me.{\r}

101
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:53,289
如果我不去，妈妈也管不着
{\fs12}lf l don't want to, Mama can't make me.{\r}

102
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,876
- 咳，妈妈　　- 你爸是怎么说的？
{\fs12}- Hi, Mama.  - What did your father tell you?{\r}

103
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:10,175
- 说什么来着？　　- 关于和你妹妹玩的事
{\fs12}- 'Bout what?  - About playing with your sisters.{\r}

104
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:13,149
哦，那个吖

{\fs12}Sheesh! l'm sure glad\nyour father let you come.{\r}

124
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:58,551
他了解的

125
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:01,352
我们是好朋友
{\fs12}He-he and l are best pals.{\r}

126
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,302
醒醒, 花花\n醒醒
{\fs12}Wake up, Flower.\nWake up.{\r}

127
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:28,441
来吧, 晚了就看不到鼠鼠了
{\fs12}Come on, Flower.\nYou're gonna miss the groundhog.{\r}

128
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,546
哎，我要看鼠鼠瞧见自己影子的样子
{\fs12}Gosh, l hope\nthe groundhog sees his shadow...{\r}

129
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:37,788
然后回来继续冬眠
{\fs12}so l can get back to hibernating.{\r}

130
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,330
大家注意，注意
{\fs12}(Friend Owl)\nAttention, everyone. Attention.{\r}

131
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:43,629
所有人，围成一圈
{\fs12}Everybody, gather round.{\r}

132
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,693
马上开始了
{\fs12}We'll be starting\nin just a few moments, yes.{\r}

133
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,864
留出足够的地方
{\fs12}Now, there's plenty of room.{\r}

134
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:53,239
小姐，挪过去一点行不?
{\fs12}Ma'am, could you just scoot over one?{\r}

135
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,471
很好
{\fs12}Very nice.{\r}

136
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:02,376
小王子，这可有点特殊
{\fs12}Oh, Young Prince.\nThis is a special occasion.{\r}

137
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,149
我们决定都挨着哥哥坐
{\fs12}We decided we'll all sit by you.{\r}

138
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:08,851
大家好
{\fs12}Greetings, greetings.{\r}

139
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,860
每年我们聚在一起
{\fs12}Each year we gather round{\r}

140
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:15,956
观看鼹鼠从冬眠中苏醒
{\fs12}to watch the groundhog\nemerge from his winter slumber,{\r}

141
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:18,524
如果他看到自己的影子
{\fs12}for if he sees his shadow...{\r}

142
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:21,070

{\fs12}(girl rabbit) ...it means more winter!{\r}

143
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:24,232
但如果他看不到
{\fs12}Yes.\nBut if he doesn't...{\r}

144
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:26,606
春天来临!
{\fs12}Spring is on its way!{\r}

145
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:28,940
是这样的
{\fs12}Yes.{\r}

146
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:33,643
现在，不要再打断我
{\fs12}Now, without any further interruptions...\n(clears throat){\r}

147
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,613
鼹鼠先生!

148
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:41,281
鼹鼠先生!
{\fs12}The groundhog!{\r}

149
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,592
鼹鼠在哪里吖?
{\fs12}Where's the groundhog?{\r}

150
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,799
鼠鼠! 鼠鼠! 鼠鼠! 鼠鼠!
{\fs12}Groundhog! Groundhog!\nGroundhog! Groundhog! Groundhog!{\r}

151
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:58,239
怎么回事啊?
{\fs12}Now, what seems to be the problem?{\r}

152
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:01,938
我不敢出来，我会看到影子的
{\fs12}l'm afraid to go out there.\nl'll see my shadow.{\r}

153
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:04,446
那就是你的任务阿?
{\fs12}Well, that's entirely the point, isn't it?{\r}

154
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:06,608
- 我才不管
{\fs12}- l don't care.\n- Oh.{\r}

155
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:09,744
每年都要这样啊?
{\fs12}Must we go through this every year?{\r}

156
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:21,691
你好, 斑比
{\fs12}Hello, Bambi.{\r}

157
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:27,267
嗨, 芬丽

{\fs12}- l almost didn't recognize you.  - Really?{\r}

159
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:34,175
大概是因为我的斑点褪掉了
{\fs12}l-l guess it's 'cause\nmy spots are almost gone.{\r}

160
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:37,442
还有我的角顶出来了  瞧见了吗?
{\fs12}And my antlers are coming in too.\nCan you see 'em?{\r}

161
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,346
呃
{\fs12}Um, well...{\r}

162
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,044
什么也看不到嘛

163
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,452
我看不到的啊
{\fs12}Well, l don't.{\r}

164
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:55,257
鼠鼠!

165
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:58,699
噢，为啥么? 和去年一样
{\fs12}Oh, why me?\nOh, this is the last year.{\r}

166
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,636
我的神经可受不了啦
{\fs12}My nerves just can't take it anymore.{\r}

167
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:06,304
我看见他的影子了  冬日未尽吖　　　
{\fs12}- l see his shadow.  - More winter.{\r}

168
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,505
继续冬眠
{\fs12}More hibernating.{\r}

169
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,016
不要影子, 不要影子
{\fs12}No shadow, no shadow.{\r}

170
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,850
请, 不要影子\n千万别有影子
{\fs12}Please, no shadow.\nPlease don't let there be a shadow.{\r}

171
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:20,686
千万别有影子
{\fs12}Please don't let there be a shadow.{\r}

172
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,651
没有影子\n没有影子
{\fs12}No shadow.\nNo shadow.{\r}

173
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:28,494
春天到了!春天到了
{\fs12}Oh, spring is here!\nSpring is here!{\r}

174
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:36,362
* 让我们为春日欢歌, 一起唱吧
{\fs12}* Oh, let's sing a gay little spring song,\nlet's get together and sing{\r}

175
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,002
哦，又是这首
{\fs12}Oh, that song.{\r}

176
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:44,172
噢，我再也不害怕啦
{\fs12}Oh, l'll never be frightened again.{\r}

177
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:59,788
看来我把他的影子都给吓出来了
{\fs12}lt looks like\nl scared the shadow right out of him.{\r}

178
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:02,593
你们看见他的
{\fs12}Did you see the look on his...{\r}

179
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:05,694
嘿!
{\fs12}Hey!{\r}

180
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:13,968
大家这是去哪儿呢?\n森林着火了吗?
{\fs12}Where's everybody going?\nForest on fire?{\r}

181
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,510
你是谁?
{\fs12}Who are you?{\r}

182
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:22,541
我叫罗罗,\n看我的家伙 - 刺啊顶啊
{\fs12}Name's Ronno,\nand these are the boys - Stab and Jab.{\r}

183
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:26,613
祝你和它们玩得开心
{\fs12}Well, l hope the three of you\nhave a nice day.{\r}

184
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,182
建议你们不要去那个方向
{\fs12}l wouldn't go that way if l were you.{\r}

185
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,922
那边我看到有个人
{\fs12}That's where l saw a man.{\r}

186
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:35,522
你看见一个人?
{\fs12}You saw a man?{\r}

187
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:40,801
当时我在森林外的大草地上
{\fs12}There l was, out in the meadow.{\r}

188
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:45,137
突然听到有声音冲我召唤
{\fs12}Suddenly l heard this voice\nluring me in.{\r}

189
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:48,975
''我在这里，在这里''
{\fs12}''l'm here, l'm here.''{\r}

190
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:55,213
人类的把戏，装成我们的声音
{\fs12}See, man's got this stick that can\nmake his voice sound like one of us.{\r}

191
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:58,049
但聪明如我，一下就看穿啦
{\fs12}But l'm way too smart for that,{\r}

192
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,784
我匍匐前进
{\fs12}so l crept up on him...{\r}

193
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,019
一点声都没有
{\fs12}real quiet.{\r}

194
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,794
然后乓!\n用我坚硬的犄角顶他
{\fs12}Then bam!\nl knocked him out with my trusty antlers.{\r}

195
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,435
故事不错
{\fs12}That's quite a story.{\r}

196
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,872
你这么认为？  嗯　　　　　
{\fs12}- Oh, you think so?  - Mm-hm.{\r}

197
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:19,875
难以相信
{\fs12}lt's... unbelievable.{\r}

198
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:23,379
难以相信
{\fs12}Yeah. Unbelievable.{\r}

199
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,540
- 你说我撒谎？  - 没有啊　　　
{\fs12}- You calling me a liar?  - No.{\r}

200
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:28,346
- 你想打架么？  - 没有啊！　　
{\fs12}- You wanna spar, do ya?  - No!{\r}

201
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,580
教训他, 斑比
{\fs12}Clobber him, Bambi.{\r}

202
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:33,680
斑比? 那不是个小姑娘的名字么?
{\fs12}Bambi?\nlsn't that a girl's name?{\r}

203
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:37,151
来吧
{\fs12}Come on. Let's go.{\r}

204
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:40,993
只是一场友谊赛
{\fs12}Just a little, friendly competition.{\r}

205
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:43,192

{\fs12}- Coming, Mother.  - Yeah. Maybe you should get going.{\r}

207
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:51,232
我只是想和他玩玩而已
{\fs12}Jeez, l was only\nplaying around with him.{\r}

208
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:53,333
不是吗, 斑比?

{\fs12}Ma! How many times\ndo l have to tell you?{\r}

211
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:01,847
别打扰我叫新朋友啊

212
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,511
亲爱的，抱歉啦

218
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:18,965

{\fs12}So tell me,\nwhat did the groundhog see?{\r}

219
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,368
再见吖, 斑比

您干嘛要走呢?
{\fs12}Why did you have to go?{\r}

228

万物都有其季节
{\fs12}Everything in the forest has its season.{\r}

229
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:25,828

{\fs12}Where one thing falls, another grows.{\r}

230
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:28,023
也许和先前不一样了
{\fs12}Maybe not what was there before,{\r}

231
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:32,330
但总有美好的新事物, 一切如常
{\fs12}but something new and wonderful,\nall the same.{\r}

232
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:34,336
可我觉得好孤单

{\fs12}Well... my father\nnever takes me with him anymore.{\r}

292
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:51,105

{\fs12}l guess l'm not\nwhat a prince's son is supposed to be.{\r}

293

{\fs12}No, l'm being brave, silly.{\r}

301
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:23,305

{\fs12}Ha! That'll teach you.{\r}

369
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:47,125
下次踏入别人领地之前要考虑清楚\n不要狗拿耗子！
{\fs12}Think twice before you trespass round here\nagain. Mind your own beeswax next time.{\r}

370
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:58,737
现在的小孩真成问题\n不尊重别人，就是不尊重自己
{\fs12}That's the problem with these kids today.\nNo respect. No respect at all.{\r}

371
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:01,750

{\fs12}l'm not gonna lie to you.\nlt ain't pretty.{\r}

{\fs12}- No one's ever got that far across before.\n- Ow!{\r}

那是什么?
{\fs12}What was that?{\r}

382
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:05,743
可能是某个可怜的笨蛋被套住了  别管他
{\fs12}Ah, probably just some poor, dumb animal\ncaught in a trap. So anyways...{\r}

383
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:08,147

{\fs12}- (Bambi) Ow!\n- Bambi!{\r}

{\fs12}- Just one more.

{\fs12}- A porcupine? Where?

388
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:23,926

393
00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:42,941
我是在说在草原上\n你是如何被吓得一动不敢动
{\fs12}l'm talking about\nhow you froze out on the meadow,{\r}

394
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,886
就在你父亲面前

{\fs12}- (Faline) Ronno!
- Don't feel bad.{\r}

396
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:53,691
如果没有胆小鬼\n我们也就看不出谁是最勇敢的了
{\fs12}lf we didn't have cowards, we couldn't\ntell who the brave ones are. Hm.{\r}

397
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,327

{\fs12}What's the big deal?\nAnyone can make that jump.{\r}

432
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:55,635

627
00:57:36,197 --> 00:57:38,028
斑比!
{\fs12}Bambi!{\r}

628
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:12,094
斑比!
{\fs12}Bambi! (echoes){\r}

629
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:25,709

醒醒!
{\fs12}Get up!{\r}

632
00:58:32,454 --> 00:58:34,786
王子是不
{\fs12}A prince does not...{\r}

633
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,039
爸爸
{\fs12}Dad.{\r}

我在这里呢
{\fs12}l'm here.{\r}

636
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:13,318
当时，瓢泼大雨，电闪雷鸣
{\fs12}(Thumper)\nlt was raining and thundering.{\r}

637
01:00:13,388 --> 01:00:16,789
对小王子来说一切都太糟了
{\fs12}lt didn't look good for the young prince.{\r}

638
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:19,827
后有成千上万的猎狗,
{\fs12}There were thousands of dogs,{\r}

639
01:00:19,894 --> 01:00:22,522
但是斑比一点都不怕
{\fs12}but Bambi wasn't a bit scared.{\r}

640
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:25,691
它们追得越来越近   越近
{\fs12}They came closer...\nand closer.{\r}

641
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:28,600
已经无路可走
{\fs12}There was nowhere to go.{\r}

642
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:34,907
有一条象树一样高的大狗\n从阴影里咆哮着冲出来,
{\fs12}Then a dog that was tall as a tree\nroared from the shadows,{\r}

643
01:00:34,976 --> 01:00:36,671
但斑比更迅速
{\fs12}but Bambi was too fast.{\r}

644
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:38,974
- 他跳起来
- 高高的　
{\fs12}- He jumped up...
- High in the air.{\r}

645
01:00:40,548 --> 01:00:43,210
- 它们撞在一起啦
- 倒在地上　　　
{\fs12}- And then came crashing...
- Crashing down.{\r}

646
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:45,844
落在大狗脑袋上
{\fs12}Right on the big dog's head.{\r}

647
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,016
安静  我正在讲话\n而最精彩的地方
{\fs12}Quiet. l'm telling it.\nBut the best part was...{\r}

648
01:00:50,091 --> 01:00:54,858
最精彩的地方是 波仔 帮助\n花花 使出最厉害的一招
{\fs12}The best part was when Thumper helped\nFlower make his bravest brave face.{\r}

649
01:00:54,929 --> 01:00:58,592
把所有狗子都吓跑了
{\fs12}(all) And scared all the dogs away.\nOops.{\r}

650
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,729
嗯，就是那样地
{\fs12}Uh-huh.\nThat's how it went.{\r}

651
01:01:01,803 --> 01:01:03,930
波仔万岁!

652
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:06,439

{\fs12}You know, they're OK for sisters.{\r}

655
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:15,343
- 可惜都是丫头片子
- 嘿　　　　　　　
{\fs12}- Just too bad they're girls.
- Hey.{\r}

656
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,849

{\fs12}Well, looks like\nthose antlers are finally coming in.{\r}

660
01:01:27,795 --> 01:01:29,922

{\fs12}Really?\nl hadn't noticed.{\r}

661
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:33,091

662
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:37,729

{\fs12}Yes, yes.\nThe one with the thousands of dogs.{\r}

663
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:38,931
上千只?
