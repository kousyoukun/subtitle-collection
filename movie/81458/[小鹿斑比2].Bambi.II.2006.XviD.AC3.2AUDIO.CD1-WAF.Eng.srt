1
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:45,813
Mother!

2
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:50,218
Mother!

3
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:54,589
Moth... (gasps)

4
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,999
Your mother
can't be with you anymore.

5
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,062
Come.

6
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:39,143
- Friend Owl.
- Excuse me, sir.

7
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,702
l hope l'm not intruding, but...

8
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,715
well, l... l just had to come.

9
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,910
Poor little fellow.

10
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,979
So young to be without his mother.

11
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,389
Well, if l can be of any help...

12
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,521
Wait.

13
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,329
l could use your help.

14
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:06,701
Find me a suitable doe to raise Bambi.

15
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:10,799
Oh, oh, yes.
Of course, yes.

16
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:13,367
Food's so scarce.

17
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:16,846
Does can barely feed themselves.

18
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,384
Perhaps you could...

19
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:25,116
Me? You know as well as l do,
a prince looks after the herd.

20
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,987
Does care for the young.

21
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:32,656
But you are his father,
and circumstances being what they are...

22
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,668
- Until spring.
- Oh, excellent.

23
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,471
After all, who better
to raise the young prince

24
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:48,377
than the great prince himself?

Good morning.

Bambi, a prince awakens

- lf you're late again, l'll have no choice...
- (stomach rumbles)

55
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:02,469
What was that?

56
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,305
- What was what?
- (stomach rumbles)

57
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:08,838
l-l guess it was my stomach.

58
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,280
Then you should eat.

59
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:15,812
Oh, well...

60
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:20,153
l suppose l should
find you something to eat.

61
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,995
Here.

62
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:32,261
Urgh. No, thank you.

63
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,534
- Have you ever tried it?
- Well, no.

64
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:41,512
Then how do you know
you don't like it if you've never tried it?

65
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:44,972
Hm?

66
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,883
Mm! Mm-hm!

67
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:50,080
(gulp) Urgh!

68
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:54,251
Come along. We have to check
on the other deer in the South Wood.

69
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:57,318
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
- Bam...

70
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:58,919
Bambi!

71
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:03,058
A prince does not whoo-hoo.

72
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:06,069
- He doesn't?
- He certainly does not.

73
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:09,300
A prince maintains control at all times.

74
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:13,003
Display dignity.
Walk with pride.

75
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:23,379
Argh! Who-o-o-a!

76
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,887
l'm OK!

77
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:33,328
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!

78
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:35,866
Ooh! Ooh!
Agh! Agh! Agh!

79
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,494
Oh! Oh!
Cold! Cold!

80
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,731
(shivers)

81
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:53,415
One, two...

82
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:55,112
two...

83
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:57,514
two...

84
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,821
(strains)

85
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:03,883
Argh!

86
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:05,088
(muffled squeaks)

87
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:28,311
Whoa!

88
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:33,016
Don't you think it'd be better
if we got a little closer?

89
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,117
The distance
makes it easier to spot danger.

90
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:38,321
(Bambi) Hm.

91
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:41,923
But it sure makes it
harder to play with them.

92
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:46,368
Play is a healthy part
of a young deer's development.

93
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:49,703
- ls that so?
- Mm-hm. Mother says so.

94
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:53,369
- One time, Mother and l were out...
- Bambi.

95
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,903
- A fawn came over and wanted to play...
- Bambi.

96
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,614
l think it's best
to leave the past in the past.

97
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:07,351
A prince does not look back,
only ahead.

98
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,620
Oh. Yes, sir.

99
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:13,460
Now, come.
We still have a lot of ground to cover today.

100
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:15,396
Don't fall behind.

101
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:53,334
Thumper!

102
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:57,205
Bambi!
Boy, am l glad to see you.

103
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,299
What's wrong?

104
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,901
They've been after me all morning.

105
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:04,073
- Who has?
- (distant voices) Oh, big brother!

106
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,049
lt's them!

107
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:09,213
(giggling)

108
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:15,285
- Hello, Young Prince.
- (all) Hello, Young Prince.

109
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,296
- Oh. Hello.
- Have you seen Thumper around?

110
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:22,222
Uh-uh.

111
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,864
l think he's over there.
Look, look.

112
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,641
Oh, OK.

113
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,303
l guess we will be leaving, then.

114
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,646
- Gotcha!
- Argh!

115
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,883
Mama says you're gonna
take us to see the groundhog.

116
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,787
What she says goes.

117
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:49,122
Well, she's not the boss of me.

118
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:52,789
lf l don't want to, Mama can't make me.

119
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:55,025
(tapping)

120
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:05,376
- Hi, Mama.
- What did your father tell you?

121
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:09,675
- 'Bout what?
- About playing with your sisters.

122
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:12,649
Oh, that one.

123
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:17,518
A family that plays together... um...

124
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,252
stays together...

125
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:26,521
even if it means
taking your dumb sisters.

126
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,596
Bambi!

127
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,496
Coming!
l gotta go.

128
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:37,871
But you can't go.
You can't leave me with the girls.

129
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:41,935
Come on, Thumper.
You gotta take us to see the groundhog.

130
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:46,413
Ahem.

131
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,707
Why don't you go with your friends
to see the groundhog?

132
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,711
But l want to stay with you.

133
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,940
Yes, well...

134
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:21,285
l have to check
on the South Meadow and it's very far.

135
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:24,981
You go see the groundhog.
l'll meet you there later.

136
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:27,524
Oh. OK.

137
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:29,685
l'll meet ya.

138
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:34,327
Hey, Thumper, wait for me!

139
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:42,737
- You sit by me!
- No, no!

140
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:45,776
Quiet! Um...

141
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,641
First one there's who l sit by.

142
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:51,148
- Hooray! lt's gonna be me!
- Uh-uh, it's gonna be me!

143
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:55,175
Sheesh! l'm sure glad
your father let you come.

144
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:58,051
Oh. He understands.

145
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,852
He-he and l are best pals.

146
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:03,155
(snoring)

147
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:15,802
Wake up, Flower.
Wake up.

148
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:27,941
Come on, Flower.
You're gonna miss the groundhog.

149
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,046
Gosh, l hope
the groundhog sees his shadow...

150
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:37,288
so l can get back to hibernating.

151
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:39,830
(Friend Owl)
Attention, everyone. Attention.

152
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:43,129
Everybody, gather round.

153
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,193
We'll be starting
in just a few moments, yes.

154
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:48,364
Now, there's plenty of room.

155
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:52,739
Ma'am, could you just scoot over one?

156
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,971
Very nice.

157
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:01,876
Oh, Young Prince.
This is a special occasion.

158
00:14:01,953 --> 00:14:04,649
We decided we'll all sit by you.

159
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:08,351
Greetings, greetings.

160
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:10,360
Each year we gather round

161
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:15,456
to watch the groundhog
emerge from his winter slumber,

162
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,024
for if he sees his shadow...

163
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:20,570
(girl rabbit) ...it means more winter!

164
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:23,732
Yes.
But if he doesn't...

165
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:26,106
Spring is on its way!

166
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes.

167
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:33,143
Now, without any further interruptions...
(clears throat)

168
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:36,113
the groundhog!

169
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:40,781
The groundhog!

170
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:45,887
(all gasp)

171
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:48,956
(all groan)

172
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,092
Where's the groundhog?

173
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:55,299
Groundhog! Groundhog!
Groundhog! Groundhog! Groundhog!

174
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:57,739
Now, what seems to be the problem?

175
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,438
l'm afraid to go out there.
l'll see my shadow.

176
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,946
Well, that's entirely the point, isn't it?

177
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:06,108
- l don't care.
- Oh.

178
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:09,244
Must we go through this every year?

179
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:21,191
Hello, Bambi.

180
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,767
Hi, Faline.

181
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:30,239
- l almost didn't recognize you.
- Really?

182
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:33,675
l-l guess it's 'cause
my spots are almost gone.

183
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,942
And my antlers are coming in too.
Can you see 'em?

184
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,846
Um, well...

185
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,544
l don't see anything.

186
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,952
Well, l don't.

187
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,553
Whoa!

188
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,095
Oh, well, yes.

189
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:54,757
The groundhog!

190
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:58,199
Oh, why me?
Oh, this is the last year.

191
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:01,136
My nerves just can't take it anymore.

192
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:05,804
- l see his shadow.
- More winter.

193
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:09,005
More hibernating.

194
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,516
No shadow, no shadow.

195
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,350
Please, no shadow.
Please don't let there be a shadow.

196
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:20,186
Please don't let there be a shadow.

197
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,151
No shadow.
No shadow.

198
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:27,994
Oh, spring is here!
Spring is here!

199
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:35,862
* Oh, let's sing a gay little spring song,
let's get together and sing

200
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,340
* Fa la la, roll de ay,
twit twit awee

201
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,502
Oh, that song.

202
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,672
Oh, l'll never be frightened again.

203
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,739
- Boo!
- Argh!

204
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,346
Oh.

205
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,389
Ah.

206
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:59,288
lt looks like
l scared the shadow right out of him.

207
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:02,093
Did you see the look on his...

208
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:05,194
Hey!

209
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:08,397
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

210
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:13,468
Where's everybody going?
Forest on fire?

211
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,010
Who are you?

212
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:22,041
Name's Ronno,
and these are the boys - Stab and Jab.

213
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:26,113
Well, l hope the three of you
have a nice day.

214
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,682
l wouldn't go that way if l were you.

215
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,422
That's where l saw a man.

216
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:35,022
You saw a man?

217
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,862
Uh-huh.

218
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:40,301
There l was, out in the meadow.

219
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:44,637
Suddenly l heard this voice
luring me in.

220
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:48,475
''l'm here, l'm here.''

221
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:54,713
See, man's got this stick that can
make his voice sound like one of us.

222
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:57,549
But l'm way too smart for that,

223
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,284
so l crept up on him...

224
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:02,519
real quiet.

225
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:09,294
Then bam!
l knocked him out with my trusty antlers.

226
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,562
(laughter)

227
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,935
That's quite a story.

228
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,372
- Oh, you think so?
- Mm-hm.

229
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,375
lt's... unbelievable.

230
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:22,879
Yeah. Unbelievable.

231
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:25,040
- You calling me a liar?
- No.

232
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,846
- You wanna spar, do ya?
- No!

233
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
Clobber him, Bambi.

234
00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:33,180
Bambi?
lsn't that a girl's name?

235
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,651
Come on. Let's go.

236
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:40,493
Just a little, friendly competition.

237
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,692
Ronno!

238
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:47,135
- Coming, Mother.
- Yeah. Maybe you should get going.

239
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:50,732
Jeez, l was only
playing around with him.

240
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,833
lsn't that right, Bambi?

241
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,640
- (mother) Ronno!
- l'm coming!

242
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:58,477
Ma! How many times
do l have to tell you?

243
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,347
Don't bother me
when l'm trying to make new friends.

244
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,011
Sorry, dear.

245
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,987
You big mama's boy!

246
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:09,288
Why don't you run home to your mama?
You big old mama's boy!

247
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,260
(mother rabbit) Thumper!

248
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:12,921
Coming, Mama.

249
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,056
Gotta go.
See you, Bambi.

250
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:18,465
So tell me,
what did the groundhog see?

251
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,868
See you, Bambi.

252
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:27,375
- Do you want us to walk you home?
- No. My father's coming for me.

253
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:31,381
Well, it was nice
to see you again, Bambi.

254
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:57,667
(sighs)

255
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,101
(giggles)

256
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,456
Bambi.

257
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:54,094
Mother?

258
00:21:06,544 --> 00:21:08,808
l miss you so much.

259
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,211
Shh. There, there.

260
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:14,911
lt's going to be all right.
You'll see.

261
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:18,011
Why did you have to go?

262
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:21,320
Everything in the forest has its season.

263
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:25,328
Where one thing falls, another grows.

264
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,523
Maybe not what was there before,

265
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:31,830
but something new and wonderful,
all the same.

266
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:33,836
But l feel so alone.

267
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:35,701
l'm always with you.

268
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:39,834
Even when you can't see me,
l'm here.

269
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,741
l'm here.

270
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,038
l'm here.

271
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,277
(female voice in distance) I"m here.

272
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,054
Hello.

273
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,682
Hello?

274
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,551
(woman) I"m here.

275
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:02,289
Mother?

276
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:04,425
(woman) It"s me.

277
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,164
I"m here.

278
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,036
Hello.

279
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:18,071
I"m here.

280
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,549
Wait!
l'm coming.

281
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:33,827
Hello?

282
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:41,160
(woman) Hello.

283
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,969
I"m here.

284
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:47,272
It"s me.

285
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:51,506
- Mother?
- (woman) I"m here.

286
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,143
Hello.

287
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,581
Hello.

288
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:59,714
I"m here.

289
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,001
(birds caw)

290
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:15,332
(barking)

291
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,666
(birds caw)

292
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:21,539
Bambi!

293
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:24,012
(barking)

294
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:33,315
Run, Bambi!

295
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:55,308
Run, Bambi!

296
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,142
Go! Now!

297
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:02,179
(gunshot)

298
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,757
But it was Mother.
l heard her voice.

299
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:19,428
- lt was one of man's tricks.
- l'm sorry.

300
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:23,462
What if l hadn't gotten there in time?
You could have been...

301
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:28,945
When l tell you to run, you run.
Never freeze like that, ever!

302
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:32,210
l'm... l'm sorry.

303
00:24:39,557 --> 00:24:41,821
Let's go home.

304
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:07,473
She's never coming back, is she?

305
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:15,655
No.

306
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:35,872
(thunder)

307
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:56,723
- (Great Prince) Friend Owl.
- Hm?

308
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,234
Winter is coming to an end.

309
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:05,071
You should have little trouble
finding a new home for Bambi.

310
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:14,814
Big brother!

311
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,379
Oh, big brother!

312
00:26:20,457 --> 00:26:22,618
Big brother!

313
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:26,653
(giggling)

314
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,129
Every time we turn our backs he's gone.

315
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,603
Search everywhere.
Leave no stone unturned.

316
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:43,275
(Flower) How come
we're hiding from your sisters?

317
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:44,541
Shh!

318
00:26:44,615 --> 00:26:49,211
- l think they're sweet.
- Well, you don't have to live with them.

319
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:54,324
(Thumper) Back up.

320
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,951
- Watch it!
- (bump)

321
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:59,852
Come on! Push harder!

322
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,398
Agh!

323
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:04,434
(Thumper) Sheesh.

324
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,867
So, where are we off to today?

325
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:09,770
You're going to stay near the den
where it's safe.

326
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,867
But l'm ready for danger,
for adventure, for... for...

327
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:15,673
The den.

328
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:18,044
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

329
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:20,345
l'll stay and guard the den.

330
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,493
Hey, Bambi.

331
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:37,193
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

332
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:40,794
Come on.
You can tell your bestest friend.

333
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:45,934
Well... my father
never takes me with him anymore.

334
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:50,605
l guess l'm not
what a prince's son is supposed to be.

335
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:54,139
- lf l could just show him.
- Show him what?

336
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,948
That l can be brave like him.

337
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:03,654
lf that's all it is, being brave is easy.

338
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:06,093
- l can teach you.
- You can?

339
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:09,655
Sure. Watch this.

340
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:11,633
Aaar!

341
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,564
l think he's got a hairball.

342
00:28:14,638 --> 00:28:18,096
No, l'm being brave, silly.

343
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:22,805
The trick is to be scarier
than whatever's scaring you. See?

344
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,472
Grrr!

345
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,976
Grrr!

346
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,286
You look like a squirrel.

347
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:32,379
Oh, oh, watch me, watch me!

348
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:34,447
- Grrr!
- (squeak)

349
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,189
E-e-ew, Flower!

350
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:42,061
You just found your inner strength.

351
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:45,067
Oh, gosh!

352
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:47,865
OK. Now, stand very straight.

353
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:49,803
Stick out your chest.

354
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:55,869
Take the deepest breath
you ever took in your whole life.

355
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,311
Now let it out with a big grrr.

356
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:03,150
Baa!

357
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:07,579
You're gonna need a lot of practice.

358
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:11,719
Come on. Do what l do.
l'm a mountain lion. Raargh!

359
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:13,194
Oh. Oh!

360
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:15,493
l'm a... a bear.

361
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,659
Baa!

362
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:20,362
l'm a turtle. Grrr.

363
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:27,207
What? Turtles are so scary.

364
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:33,341
(Thumper) Come on.
You can do it.

365
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,476
- Raargh!
- Baa!

366
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:39,318
(Thumper) Come on, now.
Watch this. Raargh!

367
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:41,118
- (Flower) Grrr!
- (Bambi) Baa!

368
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:44,888
Yeah, that's it.
Come on. Try it again.

369
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,595
Baa!

370
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:49,495
Yeah. That was good.

371
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,060
Grrr!

372
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:55,036
- Baa!
- (Flower) Grrr!

373
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:58,404
- Come on, come on!
- Baa!

374
00:29:58,475 --> 00:29:59,806
Argh!

375
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:03,077
- (Flower) Grrr!
- (Thumper) Raargh!

376
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:05,478
Baa!

377
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:09,148
- Aaar!
- (echoes)

378
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,881
- Baa!
- (echoes)

379
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:14,116
Yeah, that's it.

380
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:16,921
- Grrr!
- (deep growl)

381
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:19,258
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

382
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,221
(laughs)

383
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,601
- Baa!
- Grrr!

384
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,501
Aaar!

385
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,539
Grrr!

386
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,409
(Thumper) Raargh!

387
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:46,551
- (Thumper) Watch this. Raargh!
- (footsteps)

388
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:53,890
See? There's nothing to it.
All it takes is one good grrr.

389
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:55,830
Grrr!

390
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:57,799
Porky pine!

391
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:02,334
Get out and stay out,
you trespassing hooligans.

392
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:06,365
Trashy, muddy paws.
Couldn't you have anything nice?

393
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:10,612
Well, we can always swim across.

394
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:12,672
Uh-oh.

395
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:16,552
Let's go before he sees you.

396
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,088
No. This is it.

397
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:21,920
l can show my dad how brave l am.

398
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:25,661
You better hurry.

399
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,091
Don't worry.
l'll take care of your dad.

400
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,101
And remember what l taught you.
Grrr!

401
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:45,705
(gulp)

402
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:52,854
l'm gonna walk across this log.
Baa!

403
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,323
Get off my property, you pesky squirrel.

404
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:59,794
l-l'm not a squirrel.
l'm the young prince.

405
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:02,593
Ha! Where you going, Princey?

406
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,691
Not this way.
Try again.

407
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,069
(Thumper) Help! Help!

408
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,075
There's this thing,
and it's got these eyes,

409
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:15,668
and these claws like... grrr!

410
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:19,204
And it walks around like this.
Hai, hai, hai.

411
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:21,614
And, well, you gotta see it.

412
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,618
Well, come on!

413
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:28,849
(sighs)

414
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:31,519
Ha! Try again!
Try again! Try again!

415
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:34,359
You don't understand.
l have to get across.

416
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:39,664
Go around. ln my day, we didn't wander
willy-nilly onto someone's property.

417
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:41,363
We took the long way.

418
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:45,431
lt sometimes took days,
weeks, in the pouring rain,

419
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:49,570
'cause we had
a little thing called respect.

420
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,544
Bambi, you did it!

421
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:56,085
Yeah?
Oh, you did it all right.

422
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:01,648
(Flower) Behind you! Look out!

423
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:04,724
Again! (laughs)

424
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:08,626
Come again!

425
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:10,996
Hurry up!
lt's right over here.

426
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:12,399
(porcupine laughs)

427
00:33:12,836 --> 00:33:14,963
Oops. Wrong way.
Nothing here.

428
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:16,471
(laughs)

429
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,735
Whoa!

430
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:22,877
(growls)

431
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:26,772
(Bambi) Whoa!

432
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,410
(squeal)

433
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,752
- What was that?
- l didn't hear anything. Probably a bird.

434
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:36,952
Yeah, that's it.
A bird. Ow!

435
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:38,927
Oh, no.

436
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:41,088
Ha! That'll teach you.

437
00:33:41,164 --> 00:33:46,625
Think twice before you trespass round here
again. Mind your own beeswax next time.

438
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:52,704
(fish) Grrr, grrr, grrr.

439
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:58,237
That's the problem with these kids today.
No respect. No respect at all.

440
00:33:58,315 --> 00:34:01,250
What are you looking at,
you big moose?

441
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:04,281
Ahem.

442
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,973
- Bambi, are you OK?
- (groans)

443
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:29,739
How does it look?

444
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,542
(both) Ew!

445
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:35,574
l'm not gonna lie to you.
lt ain't pretty.

446
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:38,143
lt's hopeless.
l'm a coward.

447
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:40,781
- No. You're brave.
- Ow!

448
00:34:40,857 --> 00:34:45,590
- No one's ever got that far across before.
- Ow!

449
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:49,257
That's the great thing about me.
l don't feel any pain.

450
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,468
Watch this.

451
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:55,528
Argh! Oh!

452
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:58,130
See? Nothing.

453
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,766
(Bambi) Ow!

454
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:00,901
What was that?

455
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:05,243
Ah, probably just some poor, dumb animal
caught in a trap. So anyways...

456
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:07,647
- (Bambi) Ow!
- Bambi!

457
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:11,619
Hey!
l wasn't finished talking about me.

458
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:16,318
- Just one more.
- Bambi, what happened?

459
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:18,759
Bambi got stuck by a porky pine.

460
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:21,661
- A porcupine? Where?
- (Thumper) Hold still!

461
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:23,426
- lt was nothing.
- Are you hurt?

462
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,628
- (Thumper) Stop moving!
- l'm fine. Really. lt's just...

463
00:35:26,703 --> 00:35:28,534
Ow!

464
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:30,004
Got it.

465
00:35:30,073 --> 00:35:35,739
Bambi. l thought l recognized that scream.
l'm surprised to see you moving.

466
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:39,373
- lt was only a porcupine.
- No, no, no.

467
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:42,441
l'm talking about
how you froze out on the meadow,

468
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,386
and right in front of your father.

469
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:48,390
- (Faline) Ronno!
- Don't feel bad.

470
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:53,191
lf we didn't have cowards, we couldn't
tell who the brave ones are. Hm.

471
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,827
l'm not a coward.
Baa!

472
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,834
Oh, uh, yeah, sure, sure.
Come on. Let's go.

473
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:04,772
- l'm staying here.
- Ah, come on.

474
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:08,971
- Ronno, quit it.
- Leave her alone.

475
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:12,947
Did you say something, Bambi?

476
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:14,677
No. Uh, well...

477
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:16,878
l mean, yes.

478
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:21,287
Leave her alone. Please?

479
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:22,985
You tell him, Bambi.
