1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,100
You tell him, Bambi.

2
00:00:01,207 --> 00:00:06,144
Oh, wook. lt's the wittle bunny
and the wittle skunk.

3
00:00:06,212 --> 00:00:11,047
Does the young prince play
with the wittle bunny and the wittle skunk?

4
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:15,543
Grrr!

5
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,783
- Run!
- (growls)

6
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:22,725
Run, Bambi!

7
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:34,363
Aarrgh!

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,510
(Thumper) Whoa!

9
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,412
Other way! Other way!

10
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:45,409
Turn around! Turn around!

11
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,788
(both) Aaaarrrgh!

12
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:58,893
We made it.

13
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,566
What's the matter?

14
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:06,104
Too scared? Uh-huh.

15
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:09,335
Look at him.
Look at him shaking.

16
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,175
Now who's the baby,
you big baby?

17
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,737
- Whoa!
- Um...

18
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:17,810
Hello.

19
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:19,681
l told you to stay near the den.

20
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:23,779
When l give you an order,
l expect you to...

21
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:26,616
How did you...

22
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:30,085
Did you jump?

23
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:33,655
- Yes, sir.
- Hm.

24
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:38,466
l didn't make a jump like that
until l had antlers.

25
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:49,577
Yes. Well...

26
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,551
We should be going...

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,178
um...

28
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:57,348
home.

29
00:01:57,423 --> 00:02:00,586
He's never said
anything nice like that before.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,356
l guess he saw how brave you were.

31
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:07,297
Gosh, what a jump.
lt was like flying.

32
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:11,565
What's the big deal?
Anyone can make that jump.

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,732
Aaaargh!

34
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,434
A-a-aarrgh!

35
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,773
(splash)

36
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:33,283
Come on.
You jumped further than this yesterday.

37
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:36,021
l... don't know.

38
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:39,861
You're not afraid, are you?

39
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:43,232
(singsong) You're too afraid.
You cannot jump.

40
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:47,967
Ner-ner-ner ner-ner! Ner-ner-ner ner-ner!
Ner-ner-ner ner-ner! Ner-ner-ner...

41
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,407
Argh!

42
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,800
Whoo-hoo!

43
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,847
- You did it.
- Let's do it again.

44
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,246
And this time put it out further.

45
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,649
(Thumper) Come on, Bambi.
You can do it.

46
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,812
Wait till your dad sees this.

47
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:06,552
- Oh. Good morning, sir.
- Ahem. Morning, Owl.

48
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:11,393
Just thought l'd let you know
that the search is off to a flying start.

49
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,227
Oh! Yes, well,

50
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:19,704
no pun intended...
with the... flying... as l'm an... an owl.

51
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,205
Yes, well.

52
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:27,303
l've met with several does already
who would make excellent mothers.

53
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,784
- (Bambi) Put it out further!
- Unless you've changed your mind?

54
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:36,879
- No, l have not.
- (clears throat) Uh... uh...

55
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:39,891
Hey, watch this!
Watch this!

56
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,051
Whoa!

57
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:45,154
- Did l make it?
- (muffled) Yep. You did it.

58
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:50,300
- What exactly are you doing?
- l'm practicing my jumps.

59
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,066
- Yeah. See?
- Mm.

60
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,004
l see.

61
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:03,247
l don't get it.
Yesterday he really liked it.

62
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:06,080
What's he doing, anyway?

63
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:09,883
l don't know,
but he sure does an awful lot of it.

64
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:11,753
Well, why don't you ask him?

65
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,884
Oh, he looks busy.
l better not.

66
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:17,759
Parents like it
when you ask them questions -

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,663
lots and lots of questions.

68
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,430
- Really?
- Go on. l'm right behind you.

69
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,510
(Thumper giggles)

70
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:41,684
Um... uh...

71
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:43,415
(laughs nervously)

72
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:46,617
- What are you doing?
- Observing.

73
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:49,184
Oh. Observing.

74
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:54,722
- What's observing?
- Well, it's...

75
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:57,633
it's...

76
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:02,840
- lt's difficult to explain.
- Oh.

77
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:08,411
You have to look, listen...

78
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,778
and smell, all at the same time.

79
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,842
Oh, l can do that.

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,911
Look, listen, smell.

81
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:18,548
(sniffs)

82
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:20,615
Hm.

83
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,526
Try to feel the forest around you.

84
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,769
l don't feel anything.

85
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:35,399
- Does playing in the meadow.
- How do you know?

86
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:37,909
l feel it in my hooves.

87
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:42,573
lf there was danger,
they'd know to stomp, and l'd run to them.

88
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:47,142
- But wouldn't you be scared?
- Perhaps, but l would still run to them.

89
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,181
A prince may be afraid,
but he can't let fear stop him from acting.

90
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,353
Wow. You know everything.

91
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:57,919
(laughs)

92
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:01,091
Not everything.

93
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:04,159
Well, the forest is waiting.

94
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,809
Are you coming?

95
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,074
Oh! Sure!

96
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,418
(sisters) Big brother!

97
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:26,219
Oh, for crying out loud!

98
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,261
Feel the forest.
Feel the forest.

99
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,228
- Feel the forest.
- Bambi!

100
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,857
Feel the...

101
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,764
Felt it.

Bambi, time to go to sleep.

148
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,315
But l can't sleep.
l'm wide awake.

149
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,112
Try.

150
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:14,448
OK, l'll try.

then one more.

Yes, yes.

Oh, l forgot.

165
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:58,153
A prince leaves the past
in the past, right?

166
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,335
That's enough questions for today.

167
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,200
Now, please get some sleep.

168
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:08,263
OK.

169
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,005
Good night.

170
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,080
Grrr!

171
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:55,376
(yawning)

172
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:58,484
(Bambi) Come on, sleepyhead.

173
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:03,017
Remind me never to let you
eat blossoms before bedtime.

174
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:05,188
Wait. l hear trouble.

175
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,891
- What? What?
- (buzzing)

176
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,366
Hornet nest - antler-high.

177
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:12,734
Very good.

178
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:16,605
- Wait! Now l see trouble.
- Where? Where?

179
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,973
Rival stag, dead ahead.

180
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:22,138
Ah, he's pretty small.
Shouldn't be any trouble.

181
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:25,274
Oh, yeah?
l can be plenty of trouble.

182
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:28,684
- No, not you.
- Yes, me.

183
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:29,778
Yah!

184
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:33,450
Now you've had it. (laughs)

185
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,618
Gotcha!

186
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:36,888
Now who's got who?

187
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,930
- There you two are. Well, yes.
- Hello, Friend Owl.

188
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,969
Well, he-hello.

189
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:47,096
l've... l've been
meaning to speak to you.

190
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:50,904
l've been looking everywhere.
l thought you'd be by the meadow now.

191
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,740
l'm afraid l got a little...

192
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,075
distracted.

193
00:12:56,148 --> 00:13:00,744
So l see. Well, no matter.
l usually find what l'm after.

194
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:05,483
Speaking of which,
there's someone l'd like you to meet.

195
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:08,186
- Mena.
- Great Prince.

196
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,785
- Bambi, go to the den.
- Bambi.

197
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:14,856
l've heard so much about you. You know,
your mama and l grew up together.

198
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,993
- You did?
- Go to the den.

199
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,832
But l want to hear about Mother.

200
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:22,840
There'll be plenty of time for that
once you're settled in your new home.

201
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,708
You're sending me away?

202
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,213
No. Just...
just let me explain.

203
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:31,476
But l did everything you said.

204
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,384
- l even heard with my hooves.
- Bambi, a prince does not...

205
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:38,514
- That's all you care about - not me.
- Don't speak to me...

206
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,924
l wish Mother was here instead of you!

207
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:49,394
Oh, my, my, my. Well, l've certainly
made a muddle of things.

208
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:51,493
No. This is my fault.

209
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,801
Bambi needs a mother.

210
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:58,365
A prince should not be raising a child.

211
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:08,412
l'm sure gonna miss you guys.

212
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:11,183
Don't worry.
We'll see each other again.

213
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:12,246
Uh-huh.

214
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:15,760
We'll come visit you, if it's not too far.

215
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:19,628
- But Mama says it is too far.
- Shh!

216
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:25,870
And if you get scared, just be scarier
than whatever's scaring you.

217
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:27,701
Grrr!

218
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:29,968
Bambi.

219
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,907
lt's time to go.

220
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:34,639
l'll never forget any of you.

221
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:39,582
Of course not.
Can't forget your bestest friend.

222
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:45,482
Being a prince means sacrifice.

223
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:49,026
He must ignore his feelings

224
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,995
and do what is best for others.

225
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:55,459
Do you understand?

226
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:58,732
l'll visit you soon.

227
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,601
Be good for Mena.

228
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,871
And never forget...

229
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,914
you are the prince.

230
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,806
(rustling)

231
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:21,149
Hello, Princess.

232
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:25,046
You're not leaving
without saying goodbye?

233
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:28,184
Ah, and l thought we were pals.

234
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,161
l feel for you.
Gosh, l really do.

235
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,893
lt's gotta be hard to have a father
that's so ashamed of you

236
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:37,197
that he'd give you away.

237
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,372
Oh, yeah?

238
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:49,574
Bambi!

239
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:54,718
Argh!

240
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,559
Bambi!
Are you all right?

241
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:10,462
(tins rattle)

242
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,466
(barking)

243
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,610
Both of you get out of here. Now!

244
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:21,669
Mommy!

245
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,250
Bambi, run!

246
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:27,808
(birds caw)

247
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:34,121
Run, Bambi!

248
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:42,793
Faster, Bambi.
Don't look back! Keep running!

249
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,029
Keep running!

250
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:54,978
Bambi!

251
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,682
Baa!

252
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:15,360
Where's Bambi?

253
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,605
Look! lt's Bambi!

254
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:32,274
Argh!

255
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:35,650
We gotta help him.
Make your brave face.

256
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:38,656
- This one? Grrr!
- Braver!

257
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:42,125
- This one? Grrr!
- No, no.

258
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:45,857
Make the bravest face
you ever made in your whole life.

259
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,126
This one? Grrr!

260
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,668
(squeak)

261
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:53,398
That's the one.

262
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:18,327
Aha! Looky who's here. l guess
somebody didn't learn their lesson.

263
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,024
l learned plenty.

264
00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:21,827
Aaarrgh!

265
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,164
Argh! Argh! Argh!
Argh! Argh! Argh!

266
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:26,067
Argh!

267
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,539
(barking)

268
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:48,986
(thunder)

269
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:51,052
(growling)

270
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:07,304
(rumbling)

271
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:39,934
(whimpers)

272
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,608
(barking)

273
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:06,036
(barks)

274
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:15,676
Bambi!

275
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,068
(crumbling)

276
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:49,742
Bambi! (echoes)

277
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,357
Bambi?

278
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:07,057
Get up.

279
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,029
Get up!

280
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:12,434
A prince does not...

281
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:06,687
Dad.

282
00:23:11,296 --> 00:23:13,787
l'm here.

283
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:16,927
l'm here.

284
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,966
(Thumper)
lt was raining and thundering.

285
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:54,437
lt didn't look good for the young prince.

286
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:57,475
There were thousands of dogs,

287
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:00,170
but Bambi wasn't a bit scared.

288
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:03,339
They came closer...
and closer.

289
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,248
There was nowhere to go.

290
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:12,555
Then a dog that was tall as a tree
roared from the shadows,

291
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,319
but Bambi was too fast.

292
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:16,622
- He jumped up...
- High in the air.

293
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:18,128
(laughter)

294
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:20,858
- And then came crashing...
- Crashing down.

295
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:23,492
Right on the big dog's head.

296
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:27,664
Quiet. l'm telling it.
But the best part was...

297
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:32,506
The best part was when Thumper helped
Flower make his bravest brave face.

298
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:36,240
(all) And scared all the dogs away.
Oops.

299
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:39,377
Uh-huh.
That's how it went.

300
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:41,578
(all) Hooray for Thumper!

301
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,087
- Look who's here.
- Oh, the young prince.

302
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:46,453
(all) Hooray!

303
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:49,220
You know, they're OK for sisters.

304
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:52,991
- Just too bad they're girls.
- Hey.

305
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:54,497
Oops.

306
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:56,898
What do you know, Bambi!

307
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,200
Ooh!

308
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:05,369
Well, looks like
those antlers are finally coming in.

309
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:07,570
Really?
l hadn't noticed.

310
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,739
Thumper's been telling us quite a story.

311
00:25:10,815 --> 00:25:15,377
Yes, yes.
The one with the thousands of dogs.

312
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:16,579
Thousands?

313
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:20,091
What can l say?
l'm a born storyteller.

314
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:22,888
l'll bet it seemed like a thousand dogs.

315
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:24,656
(laughs)

316
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:25,855
Oh!

317
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:29,128
- (all) Ooh!
- Uh... uh... uh...

318
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:32,103
Twitterpated.

319
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,536
What's twitterpated?

320
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:39,270
Well, it's...
l'll tell you when you're older.

321
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:42,973
Well, well, well.
lf it isn't the young prince.

322
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:46,711
One of these days we'll meet up again,
and when we do...

323
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:48,548
Whoa!

324
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,119
Argh! Aaargh!

325
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:58,253
Get it off! Get it off!
Mommy! Get it off!

326
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,697
Mommy! Argh! Argh!

327
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:06,135
See? l told you turtles were scary.

328
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:13,203
Oh! l gotta get going.
My dad's waiting for me.
