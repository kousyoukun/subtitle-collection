2
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:25,808
雪菲德营区 夏威夷，1941年

3
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,155
马吉欧，你好
Hey, Maggio! Hello!

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,097
你好，普威特
Hiya, Prew.

5
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,432
 你怎么会来这里？  我从薛福特堡被调过来
  What are you doing here?   Transferred from Fort Shafter.

6
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,273
你离开号角兵团了吗？
You quit the Bugle Corps?

7
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,471
 为了来这里？  不是我自己选的
  For here?   I didn't pick it.

8
00:01:55,682 --> 00:02:00,551
你错了！他们可以把这个军团 还给卡斯特将军
You made a mistake. This outfit they can give back to General Custer.

9
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,359
上尉还没进办公室
Captain ain't in yet.

10
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,321
我四处去看看
I'll look around.

11
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,177
你以为你在干什么？
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,482
 你叫什么名字？  普威特，从薛福特堡调来
  What's your name?   Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

13
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,318
 我听说过你  我也听说过你，上士
  I heard about you.   I heard about you too, sergeant.

14
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:47,091
这里是步兵团 你在太阳下山前不该玩乐的
This is a rifle outfit. You ain't supposed to have fun before sundown.

15
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,825
把球杆收起来，跟我来
Put up your cue and come along.

16
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,408
葛兰昨天去过医院 你的报告写好了吗？
Grand went to the hospital yesterday. Did you do the report?

17
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,948
 我还没有时间写，上士  你是文书官
  No time, sergeant.   You're the company clerk.

18
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,315
医官很晚才将病历送来 我会写的
The medics didn't bring back the sick book till late. I'll do it.

19
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,549
多谢！我已经替你写好了
Thanks, I already done it for you.

20
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:21,730
你是薛福特堡最棒的号手 也是全岛最棒的
You're the best bugler at Shafter. On this whole island.

21
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,425
那倒是事实
That's true.

22
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:30,536
我同情你，但站在我的立场 我还是不了解你
I feel for you, pal. But from my position, I can't quite reach you.

23
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,310
立正！
Hut!

24
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,779
 稍息  早安，长官
  At ease.   Morning, sir.

25
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,788
有什么特别的事吗？ 我只有几分钟时间
Have anything special for me? I only have a few minutes.

26
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,860
 是的，长官，有新兵报到  是的，进来
  Yes, sir. New man here.   Oh, yes. Come in.

27
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,101
长官，罗勃普威特大兵 向连长报到
Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, reporting to the company commander.

28
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,503
稍息！服役纪录呢？
At ease. Where's that service record?

29
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:11,574
生于肯塔基州 在维州梅尔堡入伍，第一号手
Born in Kentucky, enlisted first at Fort Meyer, Virginia. First bugler.

30
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,346
我通常会跟新报到的人谈谈
I make it a policy to talk to my new men.

31
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,682
本军团的运作很顺利
I have a smooth running outfit.

32
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:22,191
如果我欣赏某位士兵 他便能迅速升任无委任状士官
If I like a soldier, he can get to be a non commissioned officer quick.

33
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,962
但他得让我看看他够精明
But he has to show me he's got it on the ball.

34
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,156
你在号角兵团惹了什么麻烦？
What was your trouble in the Bugle Corps?

35
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,132
 没有惹麻烦，长官  那么你为何请调？
  No trouble, sir.   Why did you transfer?

36
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,273
那是个人因素
It was a personal matter.

37
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,500
 你有什么想问的吗？上士  是的，长官
  Something you want to ask, sergeant?   Yes, sir.

38
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,473
普威特，你原是下士
Prewitt, you was a corporal.

39
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:44,412
你却自动降为大兵 调至步兵团，为什么？
You took a bust to buck private to transfer to an infantry outfit. Why?

40
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,178
是因为你喜欢步行 还是你受不了吹号角？
Because you like to hike, or because you couldn't stand to bugle?

41
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,288
完全是个人因素
It was a personal matter.

42
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,983
 这由连长决定  是怎么样？
  Company commander decides that.   Well?

43
00:04:55,628 --> 00:05:00,691
我担任了两年的第一号手 但军士长的朋友调了进来
I was first bugler for two years. The topkick's friend transferred in.

44
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,562
第二天他便成了第一号手
The next day he was made first bugler.

45
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:08,070
 我吹号的技巧比他好  你因此而离开？
  I was a better bugler.   You left because of that?

46
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,001
 或许是有些不太理智  他的情感受到伤害
  Maybe it ain't sensible.   His feelings were hurt.

47
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,679
他们现在给我们的人手是这样的
The kids they send us now!

48
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,248
我们会恢复你的官阶 或许还让你升官
We'll get your stripes back, maybe an extra one.

49
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,851
 你知道你为何在参谋本部？  不知道，长官
  You know why you're in G Company?   No, sir.

50
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,979
我利用了一些关系 我现在是军团的拳击教练
I pulled a few strings. I'm the regimental boxing coach.

51
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,147
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,989
两年前，你就应该打赢康纳斯的
You should have won your fight with Conners 2 years ago.

53
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:31,960
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

54
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,530
去年我们在决赛时败北 但今年我一定要获胜
We lost the finals last year, but I mean to win this year.

55
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,601
我需要中量级的好手
I need a top middleweight.

56
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:44,709
 很抱歉，长官！我已不打拳了  不打拳？为什么？
  I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.   Quit fighting? What for?

57
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,039
一年多前，或许你听说过 迪西威尔斯的事
Over a year ago. Maybe you heard about what happened with Dixie Wells?

58
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,550
 你是指受伤的那家伙？  是的，长官
  You mean that fellow that got hurt?   Yes, sir.

59
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,315
我是听说过 我能了解你的感受
I heard about that. I can understand how you feel.

60
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,516
 那种事难免会发生  他是我不打的原因，长官
  Those things happen.   That's why I quit, sir.

61
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,095
你不能因为死了一个人 就说“停战”
You can't say "stop war" because one man died.

62
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,860
我们的拳击课程 是最能提振士气的
Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have.

63
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,172
军团已经有一位走音的号手
I've got a mighty sour company bugler.

64
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,780
 你喜欢这工作吗？  如果要打拳就不喜欢
  How'd you like the job?   Not if it means fighting.

65
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,749
你打算取得独行侠的声誉吗？
You trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf?

66
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,912
军队里不能有个人主义存在
In the Army, it's not the individual that counts.

67
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,186
军团不会对你施加压力
We won't put pressure on you in my outfit.

68
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,058
你只要不犯错就行了
Just don't make any mistakes, that's all.

69
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,257
我要进城去，还有事吗？
I'm going into town. Anything else?

70
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,301
 军团的预算报告要交了  你写吧
  The company fund report is due.   You do it.

71
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,994
 没有其他了？  不是的，长官
  Is that all?   No, sir.

72
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:50,938
由你全权处理 下午如果有事，代签我的名字
You fix it up. If there's anything this afternoon, sign my name.

73
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,374
 我不会回来了  是的，长官
  I won't be back.   Yes, sir.

74
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:01,085
如果不是我在后面替他打理 他早就完蛋了
He'd strangle in his own spit without me to swab his throat.

75
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,720
走吧！
Come on.

76
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,635
你已从军五年？五年半？
You been in the Army five years? Five and a half?

77
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,830
你不认为是时候 该学聪明些了吗？
Don't you think it's about time you got smart?

78
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,978
你拒绝了炸药荷姆斯 等于是自找死路
By turning down Dynamite Holmes, you put your head in a noose.

79
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,207
当拳击手很轻松 你最好学学怎么当兵
Things are soft for a boxer. You'd better know how to soldier.

80
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,443
我当得和任何人一样好
I can soldier with any man.

81
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,701
这里快变成夏威夷皇家饭店了
This is getting to be like the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

82
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,876
 她是谁？  她是荷姆斯上尉夫人
  Who is that?   She's Captain Holmes' wife.

83
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:02,241
你会被逼赛拳，因为荷姆斯上尉 想成为荷姆斯少校
You'll fight, because Captain Holmes wants to be Major Holmes.

84
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,349
他认为赢得拳赛就能升官
He thinks he'll make it with a winning team.

85
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:09,817
就算不为他，也为了我 我的工作就是让他高兴
If not for him, for me. My job is to keep him happy.

86
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,013
他愈高兴，就愈不会来烦我
The happier he is, the less he bothers me...

87
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,819
而且我就会把他的军团 管理得更好
...and the better I run his company.

88
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:20,095
 我们清楚我们的立场吧？  我知道自己的立场
  We know where we stand, don't we?   I know where I stand.

89
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:25,760
 不依他的人将一事无成  在拓荒时期或许还可以
  A man don't go his way, he's nothing.   In the pioneer days, he could.

90
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,770
但是现在你必须照章行事
But today you got to play ball.

91
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,711
列瓦！我能不能走进来之后 看到你用双手在工作呢？
Leva! Can't I walk up and find you working with both hands?!

92
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:43,254
 你们付我的薪水根本不够  替这个人准备些用品
  Not on what you people pay me.   Draw this man some supplies.

93
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,721
寝室在顶楼 把你的袋子放好后再回来
Squad room is on the top floor. Leave your bags and come back.

94
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,659
列瓦会帮你 可以替你省下四，五趟路
Leva'll help you. Save you four or five trips.

95
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,887
谢谢
Thanks.

96
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:57,001
我不喜欢浪费体力 你会需要你的体力的
I hate to see energy wasted. You'll be needing yours.

97
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:05,808
 他看来是个好人  我了解他这种人！他是死脑筋
  Looks like a good man.   I know his type. He's a hard head.

98
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:20,758
 大热天她还穿毛衣  我想她一定冷若冰霜
  Her and them sweaters.   I bet she's colder than an iceberg.

99
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,158
不会的，军士长，她很懂世故的
Not her, Top. She knows the score.

100
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,887
是吗？
Is that right?

101
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:32,094
 我在布里斯堡听说很多事  是吗？
  At Fort Bliss, I heard plenty.   You did, huh?

102
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:37,004
我认识她的伴侣 你不用告诉我了
I know the guys she played around with. So don't tell me.

103
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,111
我没有！是你在告诉我！
I ain't. You're telling me.

104
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,378
 早安，上士  早安，夫人
  Good morning, sergeant.   Morning, ma'am.

105
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,580
 我来找我丈夫  他到城里公干去了
  I'm looking for my husband.   He's in town on business.

106
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,022
他说有东西留给我 你知道吗？
He was to leave some things. Do you know about them?

107
00:09:55,194 --> 00:10:00,427
 不知道，夫人！我能效劳吗？  不用了，谢谢
  No, ma'am. Anything I can do?   No, thanks.

108
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,466
我很乐意效劳的，夫人
I'd be glad to help, ma'am.

109
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,711
我丈夫告诉我很多你的事，上士
My husband's told me a lot about you, sergeant.

110
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,180
 他说你做事的效率很高  是的，夫人
  He says you're very efficient.   Yes, ma'am.

111
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:25,255
 你为何如此有效率？上士  因为我天生聪颖，夫人
  What makes you efficient, sergeant?   I was born smart, ma'am.

112
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,190
我喜欢这个说法 再见了，上士
I love that. Well, goodbye, sergeant.

113
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,094
 她可真是啊，对吧？  真是什么？
  Man, she sure is one, ain't she?   One what?

114
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,295
 真是尤物  我看过更美的
  One woman.   I've seen better.

115
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,975
凯伦
Karen!

116
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,478
凯伦
Karen!

117
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,087
 对不起！我回来晚了  没有关系
  Sorry I'm late.   It doesn't matter.

118
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,699
我在军官乐部 被史莱特将军缠住了
I got tied up with General Slater at the Officer's Club.

119
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,664
将军说了些什么？
What did the general have to say?

120
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,830
他说要成功！战时要成功 和平时更要成功
Success, he said. Success in war, success in peacetime.

121
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,602
对我的升官却一句也没提
And not a word about my promotion.

122
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,746
有时我觉得他想降我职
Sometimes I think he's waiting to ship me down.

123
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:26,281
少去奉承将军们 多跟你的军团在一起
Spend less time buttering generals and more time with your company.

124
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,249
军团可以照顾自己
The company takes care of itself.

125
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:36,118
 我今天去找过你  我到卡纳欧黑办事
  I looked for you, today.   I had some business at Kaneohe.

126
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:40,129
 你不介意吧？  当然
  That was all right, wasn't it?   Of course.

127
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,392
我没有权利过问 那是我们同意的
I have no right to inquire. That was our agreement.

128
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,126
为什么要提起这件事？
Why bring it up?

129
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,966
我可不是你 认为的那种笨女人
I'm not as stupid as you think all women are.

130
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,870
这话什么意思？
Now, what does that mean?

131
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,443
 你又在指控什么了？  没事
  What's the accusation now?   Nothing.

132
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,343
你跟多少女人出去 也不干我的事，对吧？
It's none of my business how many women you go out with, is it?

133
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,814
但我希望你能诚实
But I wish you were honest.

134
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,389
为什么要隐瞒？ 我们之间已经这样了
Why hide anything? The way things are between us now?

135
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,027
你凭什么一直这样指控我？
What right have you to always accuse me?

136
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,557
凭什么？
What right?

137
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:18,765
你还要再翻旧帐吗？ 我还得忍受多久？
Are you going back to that again? How long before I live that down?

138
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,865
我得跟你说几次那是意外？
How many times do I tell you it was an accident?

139
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,406
拜托你，唐纳
Please, Dana.

140
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,945
我要睡了！请离开我的卧房
I'm going to bed. Please get out of my bedroom.

141
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,204
荷姆斯上尉说你不想打拳
Captain Holmes says you don't want to fight.

142
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:06,112
 没错  我请你喝杯啤酒而且谈一谈
  That's right.   Let's buy you a beer and talk.

143
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:11,780
 我们是军团的拳击手  我猜也是
  We're the company boxers.   I figured.

144
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,401
我真希望他在我家乡的弹子房
What I would give to have him in the pool room in my home town!

145
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,205
如果你跟以前一样打得好 我们就赢定了
If you box as good as before, we'll be a cinch.

146
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,780
别忘了！区冠军还可以 放十天的假
Don't forget: Division champs get ten day furloughs, son.

147
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,378
我是艾克葛罗维奇 是你的排长
I'm lke Galovitch. Platoon guide of your platoon.

148
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,717
别以为你很强悍，普威特
Don't think you're tough, Prewitt.

149
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,327
现在不说话 到野外可就要喊救命了
You no talk now, but in the field you sing different.

150
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,726
如果他不想打拳 就用不打
He don't have to fight if he don't want to.

151
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,628
我们正在打撞球！走开
We're playing pool. Take off.

152
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,635
你讨打吗？马吉欧 你最好少管闲事
You want busted head, Maggio? Then keep your big nose out.

153
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,704
下礼拜开始集训
Training starts next week...

154
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:08,279
我已告诉过荷姆斯 现在我告诉你，我不打拳了
Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you. I ain't fighting.

155
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,440
我已经不打拳了 你们可以尽管威胁我
I quit fighting! You guys want to put the screws on, go ahead.

156
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:17,645
 你想做什么，我能忍受  好了，普威特
  I can take anything you dish out.   Okay, Prewitt.

157
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,620
谢谢
Thanks.

158
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,064
我不喜欢看到好人被欺负
I hate a good guy to get it in the gut.

159
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:37,334
习惯吧！小子 你在死之前，会常见到的
Get used to it, kid. You'll see a lot of it before you die.

160
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,484
你真够胆，对吧？
You don't scare easy, do you?

161
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,488
军队有规定我一定要打拳吗？
Army regulations say I got to box?

162
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,148
本军团的每个拳手都是 无委任状士官
Every boxer in this outfit's a non com.

163
00:14:54,793 --> 00:15:00,060
你不曾见过他们 聚集在一起给某人特别训练
You've never seen them get together and give a man the Treatment.

164
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,833
你怎么会称她小妞？ 她已经四十五岁了
What do you mean "chick"? She's forty five.

165
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,665
 对你来说还太年轻  我比你好多了
  Still too young for you.   I'm a better man than you.

166
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,307
 别忘了  我不会忘的
  Don't forget it.   I won't forget it.

167
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,181
华登是怎么回事？ 我不了解他
What's the deal with Warden? I don't figure him.

168
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,151
他不像别人
He ain't like the others.

169
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,458
他会对你很严厉
He'll make it tough on you.

170
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,687
但他会划定一条公平界线 而且会谨守份际
But he'll draw a line he thinks fair and won't cross it.

171
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,490
现在很少有这种军士长了
You don't see many topkicks like him no more.

172
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,693
他在十五军团时 在上海作战
He was with the 15th in Shanghai when they saw action.

173
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,203
连在菲律宾的我 也听说过他的战绩
I heard about it in the Philippines.

174
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,105
我只知道 他是我见过最好的军人
All I know is he's the best soldier I ever saw.

175
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,094
 答数！继续答数  1，2，3，4
  Count, keep count!   One, two, three, four.

176
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,904
跟上脚步，普威特
Get in step, Prewitt!

177
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,039
这是出操，可不是野餐 快跟上脚步
This is a drill, not a picnic. Get in step!

178
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,330
普威特！向前一步，走！
Prewitt! One step forward, march!

179
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:49,297
你的步法好像喝醉的鸟一样 我来教你出操！留在原地
You march like a drunken bird! I'll teach you to drill. Stay here.

180
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,671
小队解散！
Platoon dismissed!

181
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:59,013
士兵！向右转
Detail, right face!

182
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,039
组合武器！预备！开始
Assemble your weapons. All right, start.

183
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,046
来福枪是你最好的朋友
A rifle's your best friend.

184
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,950
如果在战斗中卡住了 可能会让你丧命
If it jams in combat, could mean life or death.

185
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:43,661
你一定得学会蒙着眼 也可以组合与拆解
You got learn to strip 'em down and put 'em back together blindfolded.

186
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:06,209
你的后瞄准器不准 你在瞄准三百码时会误失五十尺
Your rear sight's off! You'd be 50 feet off target at 300 yards.

187
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,649
士兵不了解他的武器 就会发生这种状况
That's what happens when a soldier don't know his rifle.

188
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,154
跑七圈！把枪举在胸前
Seven laps! Keep the rifle at high port!

189
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,223
懂了吗？普威特 或许再七圈你就懂了
Wide open, huh, Prewitt? Maybe seven more laps'll teach you.

190
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,397
你疯了？我看到你做的事了
Are you crazy? I saw what you did.

191
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,749
她是个大麻烦 别再想你在想的了
She's trouble. Stop what you're thinking.

192
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,685
你想在李汶渥斯监狱终老吗？
You wanna wind up in Leavenworth?

193
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,766
我赶不上归营号了
I won't be back in time to take retreat.

194
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,838
 或起床号  是的，长官
  Or reveille, either.   Yes, sir.

195
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:43,008
只管工作没有娱乐，上士 你只会做文书工作
All work and no play, sergeant. All you do is sweat over papers.

196
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,673
除了工作还有其他事情
There are other things beside work.

197
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,320
 多多出去走走，华登  我一直在考虑这件事
  Get out more, Warden.   I've been considering it.

198
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,116
我要走了 事情就留给你处理，上士
I'm going. I'm leaving it in your care, sergeant.

199
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,352
你回来时全部都会做好，长官
It'll be here when you get back... sir.

200
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,261
原来是华登上士
Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

201
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,326
快进来！你会被两淋湿
Step inside or you'll get wet.

202
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,661
我已经湿透了
I am wet.

203
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,634
如果你想找上尉，他不在家
If you're looking for the captain, he isn't here.

204
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:50,076
 假设我找的不是他呢？  他还是不在
  And if I'm not looking for him?   He's still not here.

205
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,445
我是要找他 你知道他在哪里吗？
I am looking for him. Do you know where he is?

206
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,782
我不晓得 或许他又“到城里公干”
I haven't any idea. Perhaps he's "in town on business."

207
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,982
前几天你是这么说的，对吧？
That's how you put it the other day, isn't it?

208
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,685
我有些重要文件得请他签名
I got some papers it's important for him to sign.

209
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,326
 我打电话到俱乐部试试  别那么做
  I'll try phoning him at the club.   Don't do that.

210
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,673
我不想打扰他的酒兴
I don't disturb a man who's drinking.

211
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,701
我自己也想喝一杯
I could use a drink myself.

212
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,746
你要邀我进去吗？
Do you wanna ask me in?

213
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,519
酒就在那边柜子里，上士
The liquor's there, sergeant. In the cabinet.

214
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:45,235
你冒了极大的危险 我的女佣随时可能会到家
You're taking an awful chance. My maid is liable to be home any time.

215
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,401
星期四是她的公休日
Thursday's her day off.

216
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:56,743
 你一切都想好了，是吗？  我试着，这个职务必须如此
  You think of everything, don't you?   I try. In my position, you have to.

217
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:10,490
 这真的很重要吗？  是的，但明天也可以
  Are these really important?   Yes. But tomorrow's okay.

218
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,369
我还有副本，很容易就能处理
I got copies. It'll be easy to fix them.

219
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,599
我喜欢，上士 你很有自信
I like that, sergeant. You have confidence.

220
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:27,939
 这也是我不喜欢你的地方  这不是自信而是诚实
  It's also what I dislike about you.   It's not confidence. It's honesty.

221
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,614
我不愿意见到美人独守空闺 浪费了
I hate to see a beautiful woman go to waste.

222
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,114
你是说浪费吗？
Waste, did you say?

223
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,247
我可以告诉你很多跟这有关的事
There's a subject I might tell you something about.

224
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,050
我知道好几种浪费，上士
I know several kinds of waste, sergeant.

225
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,284
你可能不知道其中一些
You're probably not aware of some of them.

226
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,463
你有兴趣听听吗？
Would you like to hear?

227
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:52,233
比如家里没有孩子？ 也可以算是一种
For instance, the house without a child? There's one sort for you.

228
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,198
还有另外一种
Then there's another.

229
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,405
你干得好，上士
You're doing fine, sergeant.

230
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:06,607
我丈夫在休假，外头下着两 而我们两个都在喝酒
My husband's off, it's raining and we're both drinking.

231
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,982
或许你只误判了一件事 那就是夫人我
You probably only got one thing wrong. The lady herself.

232
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,757
或许我并不像外表那样
The lady's not what she seems.

233
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,827
如果你明白我的意思 她过气了
She's a washout, if you know what I mean.

234
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,821
我相信你明白我的意思
And I'm sure you know what I mean.

235
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,158
你想哭吗？
You gonna cry?

236
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,734
我一定忍住不哭
Not if I can help it.

237
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,536
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

238
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,611
我要走了 那不是你所希望的吗？
I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?

239
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:47,084
我不知道，上士 我不知道
I don't know, sergeant. I don't know.

240
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,622
 快一点  我是很快！发薪日…
  Speed it up.   I am. Payday, payday.

241
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,231
够了，马吉欧 你想领钱吗？别闹了
All right, Maggio. You want to get paid? Knock it off.

242
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:44,710
对不起！我已经赢了不少钱 而且你们赌注太少
Sorry, I already won my bankroll. Besides, it's a penny ante game.

243
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:54,288
快点！小子！我们要进城去
Come on, buddy boy, we're going to town.

244
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,470
别让他们惹恼你
Don't let them get your goat.

245
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,801
我们可以穿便服 看起来跟别人一样帅
We'll dress in civvies and we're as good as everybody else.

246
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,176
来！穿这件
Here, wear this.

247
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,845
是我姐姐寄来的 她买的东西都太大了些
My sister sent it to me. She buys everything too big.

248
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,517
我们先去几家酒吧逛逛
First we hit a few bars.

249
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,558
我是新国会俱乐部的会员
I'm a member of The New Congress Club.

250
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:34,388
女孩们！你对女人有偏见吗？
Girls! You got any prejudices against girls?

251
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,963
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

252
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,168
你已经为今晚准备整齐了 你想找个伴吗？
You're primed for a big night. You want some company?

253
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,312
不用了！谢谢！我都约好了
No, thanks. All tied up.

254
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,176
列瓦说你在觊觎上尉的老婆
Leva says you've been eyeing the captain's wife.

255
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,114
他这么说吗？ 他还告诉你什么？
He does, huh? What else he tell you?

256
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,720
她在布里斯堡跟过很多男人
She was with a lot of men at Fort Bliss.

257
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,357
我对那些故事没信心
I wouldn't put stock in those stories.

258
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,859
这可不是故事 因为我也是其中之一
This ain't no story. Because I was one of them myself.

259
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:09,124
只是为期不长 她真的有点奇怪
Not for long, though. Sure is something strange about her.

260
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,528
 谢谢你的提醒  回头见
  Thanks for the tip.   See you.

261
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,340
你好
Hello.

262
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,712
 我没想到你会来  为什么不？我并没有迟到
  I didn't think you were coming.   Why not? I ain't late.

263
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:33,552
没有，但是我早到了 我一定是太过焦虑了
No, but then I got here early. I must have been overanxious.

264
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:37,388
 但是你没有  我先去喝了几杯
  You weren't, though.   I stopped for some drinks.

265
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:42,158
好美的地点 五分钟内就有三个人来约我
A lovely spot. I've had three chances to be picked up in five minutes.

266
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,301
对这样来说是差不多
That's par for the course here.

267
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:48,768
我不在意 我从不曾有过秘密恋情
I don't care for it. I never went in for back alley loving.

268
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,999
放轻松
Take it easy.

269
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,603
你一定认为我是水性杨花
You must think I'm a tramp.

270
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,475
你为什么认为我会那样想？
What makes you think I'd think that?

271
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:03,950
用不着这么客气，上士 如果这是个错误，直说无妨
Don't try to be gallant, sergeant. If this is a mistake, say so.

272
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:10,527
我想我该回家了，不是吗？
I guess it's time for me to go home, isn't it?

273
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,698
 不是吗？  是什么让这一切开始的？
  Isn't it?   What started all this anyway?

274
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,197
如果这是个错误 我还会来吗？
Would I be here if it was a mistake?

275
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:22,135
冒了在李汶渥斯待二十年之险 只为了陪伴连长夫人？
Twenty years in Leavenworth for being with the company commander's wife?

276
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,969
而她的态度像亚斯特夫人的马 只因为我准时到达
Her acting like Lady Astor's horse, because I'm on time!

277
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,285
我在衣服里穿了游泳衣
Well, I've got a bathing suit under my dress.

278
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,919
我也一样
Me too.

279
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,007
新国会俱乐部

280

  Why, it's Angelo Maggio.   Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

281
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,744
你来了！甜小子 钱都付清了
There you are, sweetie pie. Dues all paid up.

282
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,140
是谁在弹琴？河马吗？
Who's playing the piano, a hippo?

283
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:40,340
 我没见过你的朋友  罗勃普威特大兵
  I haven't met your friend.   Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

284
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,986
我讨厌你这个样子
I hate it when you're in this condition.

285
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:47,887
女人看见一位士兵 而且她认为他喝醉了
A woman sees a soldier and she figures he's drunk.

286
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,618
 为什么？你知道为什么吗？  因为他是喝醉的
  Why? You know why?   Because he is.

287
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,128
喝酒不能跟娱乐业混为一谈
Drinking doesn't mix with the entertainment business.

288
00:28:54,332 --> 00:29:00,328
 我们得考虑我们的未来  跟我们一起，你的未来很安全
  We have to consider our future.   Your future will be safe with us.

289
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,672
安杰罗是我最爱的客人之一
Angelo is one of my favorites.

290
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,538
阿妮特，请替我招呼这位客人

291

295
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,026
还有与异性风雅的消遗
...and gentlemanly relaxation with the opposite gender.

296
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:28,029
 不可以喝酒，明白了吗？  明白了
  No liquor is permitted. Got it?   Got it.

297
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,493
女孩们！又来了新毒药 这是比利珍和南西

这两位是苏珊和萝珊

301

 你好  你想跳舞吗？甜心
  Hello there.   Would you like to dance, honey?

302
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:34,221
很感谢你的陪伴 但可否容我失陪？
Much as I adore your company, may I tear myself away?

303
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:39,961
我看到门口有朋友 看来你已经用不着我了
I saw some friends at the door. And I see I'll be of no more use to you.

304
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,079
嗨！你忙吗？

萝琳是吗？
Lorene, huh?

307
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,895
 我以前不曾见过你  我没有来过这里
  I haven't seen you before.   I haven't been before.

308
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,861
是我朋友带我来的 我们驻扎在雪菲德
My friend brought me. We're stationed at Schofield.

309
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,166
 我没想到你是军人  这是什么意思？
  I didn't think you were a soldier.   What do you mean?

310
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:20,476
我今年三十岁 我可是全心奉献
I'm a 30 year man. I'm in for the whole ride.

311
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,781
当男人把它当成事业时 就完全不一样
It's different when a fellow's making a career of it.

312
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:30,944
 当兵并没有什么不对  我还是一样喜欢你
  Nothing wrong with a soldier.   I like you just the same.

313
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:35,182

真好玩！当我进来时 看到你坐在这里
It's funny. I came in and saw you sitting here.

315
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:44,798
 停下来或者用个消音器  我想弹多大声都行！意大利佬
  Knock it off or put a mute in it.   I'll play as loud as I want, wop!

316
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,493
意大利佬？
Wop?!

317
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,937
 我要修理你，胖子  你急着找大麻烦，意大利佬
  I'll bust you up, fat stuff.   You're in a hurry for trouble, wop.

318
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,741
 在这里等我  没问题
  Wait right here for me.   Yeah, sure.

319
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:02,211
 墨索里尼在教我弹琴  你弄伤了我的耳膜
  Mussolini's telling me how to play!   You're busting my ear drums!

320
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,547
 拜托  别打了
  Please.   Break it up.

321
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:08,351
 如果你不能守规矩就得离开  只有朋友能叫我“意大利佬”
  You must go if you can't behave.   Only my friends call me "wop"!

322
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,921
 知道他是谁吗？  我不在乎
  Know who he is?   I don't care.

323
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,463
胖子贾德森 禁闭室的警卫士官长
Fatso Judson, sergeant of the guard at the stockade.

324
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,303
我看过他差点杀了人 他乐在其中
I seen him nearly murder a guy. He likes it.

325
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:29,777
 你赢了战争！我们跳舞吧  我得先镇静一下
  You won the war, let's dance.   First I got to calm my nerves.

326
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,812
我们到电话亭去
Let's go to a phone booth.

327
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:36,783
我要把藏在夏威夷衫下的 一大瓶威士忌喝掉
I'll unveil a fifth of whiskey I have hidden under my sportshirt.

328
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,649
别受伤了，朋友
Don't get hurt, pal.

329
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,036
你一定要有无讹的平衡感
Your balance has got to be letter perfect.

330
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,567
 我以为你在等  比尔正在说冲浪的事
  You were gonna wait.   Bill was talking about surfboarding.

331
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,243
坐下来听！他讲得很刺激
Sit and listen. He describes it thrillingly.

332
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,438
 你知道冲浪吗？  完全不了解
  You know about surfboarding?   Not a thing.

333
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,176
我住在迪罗西所以有很多机会
I'm at DeRussey, so I get lots of chances.

334
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,217
但是我们有山
But we got mountains.

335
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,185
 你知道如何爬山吗？  一点点
  Do you know mountain climbing?   A bit.

336
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,987
 你很会爬山吗？  不会！你会开飞机吗？
  You a mountain climber?   No. Know how to fly an airplane?

337
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,857
 我上过几堂课  我也不会开飞机
  I had a few lessons.   I can't fly either.

338
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,965
你对于深海潜水了解多少吗？
What do you know about deep sea diving?

339
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,164
我们去别的房间
Let's go to another room.

340
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:30,535
 空气好像变得很混浊  我也注意到了
  The air seems to have gotten lousy.   I noticed that.

341
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,166
 听着！老兄  走吧！我们走
  Listen, fella.   Come on, let's go.

342
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:42,841
 深海潜水夫怎么了？  你的态度糟透了
  How's the deep sea diver?   That was a terrible way you acted.

343
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:48,576
 或许我只是嫉妒  你真的很好玩
  Maybe I was jealous.   You're a funny one.

344
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,018
你们女人到底想怎样？ 玩弄男人到死吗？
What do you dames want? To tease a man to death?

345
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,751
奇佛太太付钱请我们 对所有男人好
Mrs. Kipfer pays us to be nice to all the boys.

346
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,953
他们都一样，这很重要吗？
They're all alike. Is it so important?

347
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:02,690
是很重要 或许我们很相像但我们并不一样
It is important. We may seem alike, but we ain't.

348
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,764
对不起
I'm sorry.

349
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:15,310
我们到奇佛太太的接待室坐一下
Look, let's go to Mrs. Kipfer's parlor and sit there.

350
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:19,074
她让我们用来接待特别贵宾
She lets us use it for somebody special.

351
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,945
我去问她
I'll go ask her.

352
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,883
 你不生气了？  不气了
  Then you're not mad?   No.

353
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:28,024
如果你生气了 我宁可不再继续
Because if you are, I'd rather we call the whole thing off.

354
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,925
你真的是个好玩的家伙
You certainly are a funny one.

355
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:16,039
我从来不知道是这样子的 没有人像你这样吻过我
I never knew it could be like this. Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

356
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,841
 没有人？  没有
  Nobody?   No. Nobody.

357
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:25,641
一个都没有？ 你所吻过的所有男人？
Not even one? Out of all the men you've been kissed by?

358
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,011
那可得好好算算
That'd take some figuring.

359
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,619
 你想有多少人？  我不知道
  How many do you think?   I don't know.

360
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:34,189
 告诉我一个估计  没有计算机算不出来
  Give me an estimate.   Not without an adding machine.

361
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,124
 你有计算机吗？  我忘了带
  Do you have one?   I forgot to bring it.

362
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,127
那么我想你是不会知道
Then I guess you won't find out.

363
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,899
或许我已经知道了
Maybe I already know.

364
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,967
怎么了？你在暗示什么？
What's the matter? What are you hinting at?

365
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,578
有什么好暗示的吗？
Is there something to hint at?

366
00:36:56,147 --> 00:37:00,481
 搞不好有过很多海滩派对  你一定是疯了
  Maybe there were many beach parties.   You must be crazy.

367
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:04,781
是吗？你跟荷姆斯 在布里斯堡又如何？
Am I? What about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss?

368
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:10,025
你听说过史塔克大兵吗？ 梅隆史塔克？
Did you ever hear of a soldier named Stark? Maylon Stark?

369
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,959
 是知道的  “是知道的”
  Why, yes.   "Why, yes."

370
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,128
你也认识他，对吧？对吧！
You knew him too, didn't you? Didn't you!

371
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,104
你跟其他人都一样
You're like all the rest of them.

372
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,676
那些事都是真的，对吧？ 对不对？
Only it's true, ain't it? Well, ain't it?

373
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:43,519
你为什么不告诉我？ 总是有故事的
Why don't you tell me about it? There's always a story.

374
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:47,528
你不留给任何人任何余地 对吧？
You don't leave a person anything, do you?

375
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,976
回来！上士 我会把故事告诉你
Come back here, sergeant. I'll tell you the story.

376
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,956
你可以把故事带回营区
You can take it back to the barracks with you.

377
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,662
我只结婚了两年 就发现他有外遇
I'd only been married two years when I found out he was cheating.

378
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:28,464
当时我已经怀孕 让我有了可以期待的事
By that time, I was pregnant. I had something to hope for.

379
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,109
阵痛开始那晚 我差点觉得高兴
I was almost happy the night the pains began.

380
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,336
唐纳去出席军官会议
Dana was going to an officers' conference.

381
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,241
我告诉他要早点带医生回来
I told him to get home early, with a doctor.

382
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:42,147
那会议不是和女人开的话 他就会照办
And he would have, if his conference hadn't been with a girl.

383
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:47,086
他到了凌晨五点才喝醉了回来 当时我躺在地板上
He came in at 5 a.m., drunk. I was lying on the floor.

384
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:52,354
我求他去找医生 可是他醉倒在沙发上
I begged him to go for the doctor, but he passed out on the couch.

385
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:57,023
孩子在一小时后生了下来 当然是死了
The baby was born about an hour later. Of course it was dead.

386
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:00,260
是一个男孩 他们送我到医院急救
A boy. They worked over me at the hospital.

387
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,430
他们救活了我 还免费替我割了盲肠
They fixed me up. They took my appendix out, for free.

388
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:09,011
 凯伦？  还有一件事，我也不能生育了
  Karen?   And one more thing: No more children.

389
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,546
我是跟男人出游 看看我能否找到一个…
Sure, I went out with men. And if I'd found one that...

390
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,483
凯伦，听我说
Karen, listen to me, listen.

391
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:26,852
我知道！直到我遇见你 我也认为这是不可能的
I know. Until I met you, I didn't think it was possible either.

392
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,377
我也到军中服务 独自一人离开奥勒冈的家
I enlisted too. I came on my own to get away from my hometown in Oregon.

393
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,042
怎么会？
How come?

394
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:55,757
我原本是个女侍 我男友来自最富裕的家庭
I was a waitress. My boyfriend was from the richest family.

395
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,952
他娶了一个符合地位的女孩
He married a girl suitable for his position...

396
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:04,100
当时他已与我交往了三年 很棒的故事吧？
...after three years of going with me. It's a pretty story, isn't it?

397
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,704
 这个故事可以写一本书  写过了！太多人写了
  They could write a book about it.   They did. Thousands of 'em.

398
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:13,240
所以我离家到了西雅图 我遇见一个从夏威夷回去的女孩
I left and went to Seattle. I met a girl back from Hawaii.

399
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,403
她在那里赚了大钱 所以我搭上第一班船
She'd made money there. So I caught the first boat.

400
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:21,608
 我已经来这里一年两个月  而你并不喜欢
  I've been here a year and two months.   You don't like it.

401
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:26,085
我是不喜欢但我并不在意 我不会永远待在这里
I don't like it. But I don't mind it. I won't be here forever.

402
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,918
当然不会，为什么要呢？
No. Sure. I mean, why should you?

403
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:34,223
再过一年我就会赚了很多钱 回家去了
In another year, I'll be back home, with a stocking full of money.

404
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,458
之后我可以重新过生活
And then I'll be all set for life.

405
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,431
哪一位？
Who is it?

406
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,436
我没有听到争吵声 所以以为你们也想喝一杯
I didn't hear no combat, so I thought you might want a drink.

407
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,410
你独占那瓶威士忌，安杰罗
You've been hogging the whiskey, Angelo.

408
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,711
不是我！是珊卓拉 她是很好可是太会喝酒了
Not me. It's that Sandra. She's nice, but she drinks like a fish.

409
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,453
我希望下面有警察
I hope there's a cop under that.

410
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,352
继续倒
Keep pouring.

411
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,628
不了！谢谢！我不喝酒 我觉得那是个缺点
No, thanks. I don't drink. I think it's a weakness.

412
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,138
我允许你的看法
I grant you that.

413
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,211
我不喜欢缺点，你呢？
I don't like weakness. Do you?

414
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,471
不喜欢，但我想喝酒
No, but I like to drink.

415
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,722
你要嫁给这家伙吗？ 你对他笑的样子好像是他老婆
You gonna marry this guy? You grin at him like you're his wife.

416
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,325
滚出去！
Get out of here!

417
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,621
好…我要回去找长腿珊卓拉
Okay. Okay. I'm going. Back to long legged Sandra.

418
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,960
我喜欢腿长！绵延不绝
I love them tall. Acres and acres.

419
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,704
好好享受！老兄 你比我更需要这个
Enjoy yourself, <i>paisan.</i> You need this more than I do.

420
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,540
明天你得继续接受特训
Tomorrow you're back with the Treatment.

421
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,847
他是什么意思？
What does he mean?

422
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:07,190
你在他面前依偎在我身边真好
That was nice how you snuggled up in front of him.

423
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,359
什么是特训？
What's a Treatment?

424
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:14,823
有些人因为我不打拳 所以对我施压
Some guys putting me over the jumps because I don't want to fight.

425
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,967
 打拳？  是的，参加拳击队
  Fight?   Yeah. On the boxing team.

426
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,796
我不想打拳击
I don't want to box.

427
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,269
你为什么一定要打拳呢？
Why should you have to box?

428
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,808
我以前是打中量级的
I used to fight, middleweight.

429
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,504
而且我打得很好 他们大家都知道
I was pretty good, and they know it.

430
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:37,044
快点告诉我！我想听
Come on. Tell me. I want to hear.

431
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:43,784
当时我跟一个叫 迪西威尔斯的人练习
Well, I used to work out with this guy, Dixie Wells.

432
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,930
他是我的一位好朋友 他很喜欢拳击
He's a real good friend of mine. He loved to box.

433
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,226
外头的人都看好他
People on the outside had their eye on him.

434
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,835
他原本可以晋到最高级
He was gonna go right to the top.

435
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,940
有天下午 我跟他在健身房练习对打
One afternoon, he and I were sparring in the gym.

436
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,508
你知道，就是友善那种打法
You know, kind of friendly like.

437
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,374
他可能是太累了
And he must have been set pretty flat on his feet...

438
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,848
因为我不过是…
...because I caught him with...

439
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,982
用普通力气打了他一记右拳
...a no more than an ordinary right cross.

440
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,793
他没有爬起来，动也不动 他昏迷了一个礼拜
He didn't get up. He didn't move. He was in a coma for a week.

441
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,762
最后终于清醒了
And finally did pull out of it.

442
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,827
可是他却瞎了
The thing was that he was blind.

443
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,108
我到医院去看了他几次
I went to see him at the hospital a couple of times.

444
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,076
后来我再也无法去看他
Then, I just couldn't go back.

445
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:44,516
最后一次当我们谈起拳击
The last time we started talking about fighting and...

446
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,981
他开始哭
...he started to cry.

447
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,727
看着那双瞎了的眼睛流着泪…
And seeing tears coming out of those eyes that couldn't see anything...

448
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,159
我应该告诉你 荷姆斯跟他的拳手谈过了
I ought to tell you. Holmes spoke to his boxers.

449
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,454
从现在开始，不会对你客气
From now on, no holds barred.

450
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:31,067
 他们打算将你逼进禁闭室  任由他们
  They aim to run you in the stockade.   Let them.

451
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:35,704
我会帮你 可是我不能太过明显
I'll help you, but I can't get too far out on a limb.

452
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:39,034
我不会牺牲自己的军阶 我喜欢这个军团
I ain't risking my stripes. I like this outfit.

453
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,733
我也一样
So do I.

454
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:45,606
 真好笑，不是吗？  是的，是很好笑
  That's funny, ain't it?   Yeah, that is funny.

455
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,818
保持一直线，普威特
Keep going in a straight line, Prewitt.

456
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,652
继续走！
Keep going!

457
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,896
好了！够了
All right, that's enough.

458
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,515
普威特！把它埋了
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

459
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,434
时间到
Time!

460
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,261
把这里清干净，普威特
Clean up the mess, Prewitt.

461
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,027
快！这是劳动！可不是在度假
Hurry up! You're on fatigue detail, not a vacation.

462
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,370
快点！把它清干净
Come on! Clean it up!

463
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,380
你自己清
Clean it up yourself!

464
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,885
 什么？  要清你自己去清理
  What?   Rub your own nose in it a while.

465
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:08,649
你不该跟无委任状士官顶嘴
You shouldn't talk back to a noncommissioned officer.

466
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:13,456
但我可不喜欢 被无委任士官侮辱
But I don't like being spit on by a noncommissioned officer.

467
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,928
 你应该向他道歉  绝不，长官
  You owe him an apology.   No, sir.

468
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,260
是他该向我道歉
He owes me an apology.

469
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,027
 帕路索下士  是的，长官
  Corporal Peluso?   Yes, sir.

470
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:25,869
让这个人全副武装 带他去跑可洛可洛山路
Have this man roll a full field pack and hike him up to Kolekole Pass.

471
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,544
 然后再带他来见我  是的，长官
  And then bring him to me.   Yes, sir.

472
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,475
 好了，普威特！我们走  时间
  All right, Prewitt, let's go.   Time!

473
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,420
等一下
Hold it a minute.

474
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:52,769
抽根烟吧 我跟你一样不喜欢这种事
Go ahead, have a cigarette. I don't like this any more than you.

475
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,500
你预备好向 葛罗维奇士官道歉？
You're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now?

476
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,507
不，长官！我不道歉
No, sir, I'm not.

477
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,440
 帕路索！再带他去跑一圈  是的，长官
  Peluso, take him up there again.   Yes, sir.

478
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,381
好了，普威特！我们走
All right, Prewitt, let's go.

479
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,738
你不能善待这种人 他好像是头野兽似的
You can't be decent to a man like that! He's like an animal.

480
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:37,603
上士，准备军法审判的表格 罪名是抗命
Sergeant, prepare court martial papers. Insubordination.

481
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,441
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

482
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,951
 只是太可惜了  怎么了？
  Only it's a shame.   What is?

483
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,791
你将会失去一名中量级好手
You'll lose a good middleweight.

484
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,093
我不需要忍受他的无礼
I don't have to stand for insolence!

485
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,237
不，长官！当然用不着
No, sir, you sure don't.

486
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,840
我马上准备表格
I'll prepare the papers then.

487
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:12,115
就算他只被判刑三个月 决赛时他会待在禁闭室中
Even if he gets three months, he'll still be in stockade for the finals.

488
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,251
你有办法说服他吗？
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

489
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,246
你可以加重惩罚，长官
You could double punishment, sir.

490
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:24,689
 我会用重刑  如果你那么觉得的话，长官
  I'll throw the book at him.   Lf you think that's the way, sir.

491
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,130
好建议！上士
Nice going, sarge.

492
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,174
继续看的话 你会发现自己在刷地板
Keep looking, you'll find yourself scrubbing this floor!

493
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,688
借过！
Coming through!

494
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:03,355
我和服务生们已经忙坏了 烫！烫！
Me and my waiters are working our tails off. Hot! Hot!

495
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,671
你好吗？在这里比被关禁闭好
How you doing? It's better than being in the stockade.

496
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,407
我好吗？我是个粗人
How am I doing? I'm a rough man.

497
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,910
慢一点！汗别滴到菜上
Slow down. Don't sweat in the food.

498
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:21,175
不要阻止我 我正在申请升下士
Don't hold me back. I'm putting in for corporal.

499
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,114
你成功不了的
You'll never make it.

500
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,095
一生都得待在步兵团里
Life in a rifle company.

501
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,439
你看起来很累的样子，小子
You look awful tired, kid.

502
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,242
你喜欢连续当班吗？
How do you like straight duty?

503
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,675
 你认为我会介意吗？  我没有那么说
  You think I mind it?   I didn't say that.

504
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,476
我只是说你看来很累的样子 好像快崩溃似的
I just said you looked tired. Drawn to a fine edge.

505
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,182
我喜欢这种生活！棒极了
I like this life. It's great.

506
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,346
如果我找到珍珠，我会算你一份 跟你平分，知道吗？
If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in. 50 50, you know?

507
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,891
如果不是你让我来这里 我不会有机会去找它
If you didn't put me here, I'd have no chance to find it.

508
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,427
你真是的
There's a man for you.

509
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,623
既然你喜欢 我会再多替你找一些
Since you like it, I'll find more for you.

510
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:14,565
 垃圾小队怎么样？  谢了！礼拜三已经做过了
  How about garbage detail?   Thanks, I had that on Wednesday.

511
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,934
原来做过了 那么扫街如何？
So you did. What about street cleaning?

512
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,873
 昨天扫过了  你的记忆力比我的更好
  Yesterday.   You got a better memory than me.

513
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:26,038
 当然！如果你聪明的话…  说得是！但我并不聪明
  Of course, if you were smart...   Yeah, but I ain't smart.

514
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,309
但如果你聪明 你就用不着做炊事兵
But if you were, you wouldn't have to pull K.P.

515
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,215
或者其他劳动工作
Or any other fatigue duty for that matter.

516
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:36,256
如果你认为可以说服我打拳 那你就错了
If you think you can bribe me into boxing, you're wrong.

517
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:41,193
你错了！你没有办法 荷姆斯跟特训也办不到
You're wrong. Not you and Dynamite Holmes and the Treatment.

518
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:51,439
你还要压迫普威特多久？
How long will you keep breaking it off on Prewitt?

519
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:56,739
你已连续一个月罚他加班了 我不明白为什么你…
You've had him on extra duty for a month. I can't see why you...

520
00:51:56,913 --> 00:52:00,212
年纪大心也变软了吗？ 或许我是在给他些教训
Getting soft in your old age? Maybe I'm teaching him a lesson.

521
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,510
 或许是你喜欢这样  或许我是喜欢
  Maybe you like it.   Maybe I do.

522
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:06,949
我不想再看你做荷姆斯的爪牙
I'm getting tired of watching you being a stooge for Holmes.

523
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,182
你不会再看多久了
You won't see it much longer.

524
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:13,920
我自己也很厌烦 我随时都可以不干！真的
I'm tired of it myself. I'm through, any day now. I mean it!

525
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,100
只要荷姆斯允许 我宁可明天就请调
If Holmes'd let me, I'd transfer out tomorrow.

526
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,428
有半打以上的军团会争取我 而且还会有官阶
Half a dozen companies would grab me. In grade too.

527
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,162
当然！我还可以做参谋长
Sure. I could be chief of staff too.

528
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:27,673
 但我不能离开我的弟兄  你要上哪儿去？应声虫
  Only I just can't leave my buddies.   Where you going, Little Sir Echo?

529
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:31,245
去冲澡！除非士官长反对
To shower, unless the stinking first sergeant objects.

530
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,940
 你以为了呢？去看电影吗？  快点！我们去喝几杯啤酒
  What'd you think? To the movies?   Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

531
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,677
就算那是世上最后的啤酒也不去
Not if it was the last beer in the world.

532
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,480
我请客
I'm buying.

533
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,813
那就不一样了
That's different.

534
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,744
萝丝
Rose.

535
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,985
知道为何我喜欢你为我服务？ 这样我才能看着你走开
Know why I like to have you serve me? So I can watch you walk away.

536
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,853
你有权抱怨 你可以去向督察长申诉
You got a right to complain, to take it to the inspector general.

537
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,897
任何士兵都可以 就连普通二等兵都行
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

538
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,433
不！我不会去申诉
Nope. I ain't going to complain.

539
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,468
我不会让他们得到满足的
They ain't going to get that satisfaction.

540
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:38,847
我有一大家人，一共十五人 这里只有一半而已
I've got a real big family, 15 of them. This is only half.

541
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,041
你看到那个留八字胡的先生？
You see the gentleman with the handlebars?

542
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,413
那是我父亲，马吉欧先生
That's Mr. Maggio, my father.

543
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,952
从没见过如此顽固的人 离他们上次让你进城有多久了？
Never saw anybody so stubborn. How long since they let you go to town?

544
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,392
 六个星期  搞不好会六年
  Six weeks.   It's liable to be six years.

545
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:59,592
 六年你都看不到女人  你何不管好自己的事？
  Six years before you see a dame.   Why don't you mind your own business?

546
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,499
你为什么不去学吹号角？
And why don't you learn to play the bugle?

547
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,732
那才是我的好兄弟
That's my buddy boy!

548
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,420
 这小妞是谁？  是我姐姐
  Who's the broad?   It's my sister.

549
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,245
 你打我  没错！而且我会再打
  You hit me!   Yeah, and I'm about to do it again.

550
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,277
你这个肮脏的意大利佬
Why, you dirty wop!

551
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,816
 到外面解决  我要切下这义佬的心脏
  Take it outside!   I'll cut this wop's heart out.

552
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,148
如果有人敢插手 我会先修理他
Anybody steps in here, I'll give it to him first.

553
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,820
再往前一步，胖子 我就会砍了你的脑袋
One step further, Fatso, and I'll de brain you.

554
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,860
这里只有我才可以杀人
Anybody does any killing here, I'll do it!

555
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:39,468
 这是私事  不！他属于我的军团
  This is a private affair.   No, it ain't! He's in my company.

556
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,230
不要无缘无故的替我制造麻烦
You ain't making two extra weeks of paperwork for me.

557
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:47,335
非打不可吗？ 搞不好会把胆汁都吐出来
Out for blood? You'd puke your guts out.

558
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,068
把凳子放下
Put down that stool.

559
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:50,712
把它放下
Put it down!

560
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,809
把刀子扔掉
Drop that knife.

561
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:06,459
好吧！胖子！ 如果你想杀人就来吧！
Okay, Fatso, if it's killing you want, come on.

562
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,555
来吧！
Well, come on.

563
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,461
丢到地板上
On the floor!

564
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:33,346
杀手？我宁可用你们 来交换一个女童军
Killers, huh? I'd trade the pair of you for a good Campfire Girl!

565
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,592
泼猴
Tough monkey.

566
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,892
你这种人迟早会被关禁闭
Guys like you end up in the stockade sooner or later.

567
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,040
总有一天我会等着你被关进来
Someday you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.

568
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,869
到时我会要你好看
I'll show you a couple of things.

569
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,892
我要出去呼吸点空气
I'm going to get a breath of air.

570
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,903
我很高兴他阻止了这件事
I'm glad he stopped it.

571
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,702
他是个好人
A good man.

572
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,032
你留着！留做纪念
You keep it. Keep it for a souvenir.

573
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,797
好吧！我会留着
Okay, I'll keep it.

574
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,997
你不太有机会享受生活吧？小子
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?

575
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,677
 你周末想放假吗？  可以吗？
  Could you stand a weekend pass?   Could I?

576
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,290
荷姆斯怎么办？
What about Holmes?

577
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,292
别担心！我放在他面前的文件 他都会签字
Don't worry. He signs anything I put in front of him.

578
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,361
我会用的到的
I sure could use it.

579
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:30,199
听说你迷恋上 新国会俱乐部一位小姐
I hear you're dippy over a dame at the New Congress Club.

580
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,307
 她叫什么名字？  萝琳
  What'd you say her name was?   Lorene.

581
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,171
好美的名字
Beautiful name.

582
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,455
嗨！老兄
Hey, <i>paisan!</i>

583
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,721
是什么绊住你了？我们走
What's holding you up? Let's go.

584
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:59,129
怎么了？你不喜欢这里吗？
What's the matter? Don't you like it here?

585
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,869
巴士就快开了！我要赶去搭车
The bus is leaving now. I'm taking it.

586
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:05,097
快走！我是有钱人 我会搭计程车
Take off. I'm a rich man. I'll hop a taxi.

587
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,970
我到卡拉库瓦跟你碰面
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua later.

588
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,552
马吉欧！预备上哨
Maggio, get ready for guard!

589
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,690
戴宽边毯帐，子弹腰带 武器！十分钟内报到
Campaign hat, cartridge belt, weapon! Report in 10 minutes.

590
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,622
什么？我有假单
What?! I got a pass!

591
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,227
那不算！安德生病了 所以你得上哨
Not anymore. Anderson's sick. You're on guard.

592
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,499
我昨天上过哨，为什么是我？
I just had guard yesterday. Why me?

593
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,568
我告诉你原因 你换衣服速度应该快一点
I'll tell you why. You should've gotten dressed faster.

594
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:46,511
你在回避我吗？ 他们甚至不让我进来
You giving me the runaround? They didn't even want to let me in.

595
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:52,382
这里有一大群希坎军营来的人 你到底想怎么样？
A big crowd from Hickam Field is here. Anyway, what'd you expect?

596
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,990
 我以为你会想见我  我正在忙，看到了吗？
  I thought you'd want to see me.   I'm busy, see?

597
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,490
 是的，我看到了  我是在忙
  Yes, I can see.   Well, I am.

598
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,698
马吉欧待会儿会去卡拉库瓦
Look, Maggio will be at the Kalakaua later.

599
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,698
难道你不能想办法离开吗？
Ain't there no way you can get out of here?

600
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:11,340
你到底怎么搞的？ 我在这里工作，你不懂吗？
What's the matter with you? I work here. Can't you understand?

601
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,200
是的，我当然明白
Yes, I do understand.

602
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,138
我非常明白
I understand very well.

603
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,111
你几个礼拜都没有来 现在突然出现…
You haven't been around here in weeks, and now you turn up all of a sudden...

604
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,809
小心！老兄！走路要看路
Watch it, mac! Watch where you're going!

605
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,784
我们到外面去
Come on out of here.

606
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:39,167
奇佛太太有规定 我不能这样就走掉了
Mrs. Kipfer has rules. I can't just walk out.

607
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,099
我们不能在外面跟男孩约会
We can't see the boys on the outside.

608
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,035
如果你是这种感觉那就算了
If you feel that way, just forget about it.

609
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:48,677
你管不着我 你又不是我丈夫
You haven't any claims on me. You're not my husband.

610
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:53,144
原来你在这里，萝琳 我欣赏你的品味但我们需要她
There you are, Lorene. I admire your taste, dear, but we need her now.

611
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,682
有许多位先生没有人陪伴 真是忙坏了
So many of the gentlemen are unattended. It is such a rush.

612
01:00:56,886 --> 01:01:00,378
搞不好有人会误解 我们在开大型政治会议
One might almost mistake us for a big political convention.

613
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,582
 你来吧？萝琳  马上来
  You are coming, Lorene?   In a minute.

614
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,054
对不起
I'm sorry.

615
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:12,428
你认为我有什么感觉？ 搞不好我几个月都无法拿到假条
How do you think I feel? I may not get another pass for months.

616
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:17,231
我期待这次见面 就像小孩期待耶诞节一样
I been counting on this like a kid counts on Christmas.

617
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,467
还是算了吧！萝琳在忙 萝琳很抱歉
But forget it. Lorene's busy. Lorene's sorry.

618
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,078
别再叫我萝琳 我的本名叫艾玛
Stop calling me Lorene! My name's Alma!

619
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,839
 艾玛？  是的，艾玛伯克
  Alma?   Yes, Alma Burke!

620
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,539
艾玛？
Alma?

621
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,413
奇佛太太从香水广告上 挑了萝琳这个名字
Mrs. Kipfer picked "Lorene" out of a perfume ad.

622
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,490
她觉得这个名字很有法国风味
She thought it sounded French.

623
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,412
你怎么脱身的？
How did you get away?

624
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:02,015
我说我病了 但我打赌她并不相信
I said I was sick. But I bet she doesn't believe it.

625
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,880
 我赌她不信  你想喝什么？
  I bet she doesn't.   What'll you have?

626
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,785
 可乐，谢谢  给她可乐，大可乐
  A Coke, please.   Give her a Coke, big Coke.

627
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,482
你能来这里见我真好
It's great you meeting me here.

628
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:15,186
我是运气好才能进城 军士长饶了我
I'm lucky to get to town. Topkick gave me a break.

629
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,956
他们还在施压吗？
They still pouring it on?

630
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,728
 他们真的让我快要崩溃  你一定很恨军队
  They really got me on the edge.   Gee, you must hate the Army.

631
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:25,567
 不，我不恨它  但把你折磨成这样
  No, I don't hate it.   But look what it's doing to you.

632
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,703
我爱军队
I love the Army.

633
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,146
但它一定不爱你
But it sure doesn't love you.

634
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:36,646
男人爱一样东西 并不表示一定有所回报
A man loves a thing, that don't mean it's got to love him back.

635
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,913
没错，但人的忍耐有限
Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.

636
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,590
你爱某件事，你应该感恩
You love a thing, you gotta be grateful.

637
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:47,991
我在十七岁时离家 我的父母亲都死了
See, I left home when I was 17. Both my folks is dead.

638
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,860
我没有归属感直到入伍为止
And I didn't belong no place till I entered the Army.

639
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,628
而且我还学会吹号角
And I wouldn't have learned how to bugle.

640
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:55,826
吹号角？
To bugle?

641
01:02:56,038 --> 01:03:01,135
这个吹口就是我在 阿灵顿公墓吹丧葬号时用的
That's the mouthpiece I used when I played a taps at Arlington.

642
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:06,505
他们选我在休战纪念日 吹奏丧葬号角
They picked me to play a taps there on Armistice Day.

643
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,616
总统也到场
The president was there.

644
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,919
我的号角吹得很好
I play the bugle well.

645
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,556
嗨！老百姓
Hello, citizens!

646
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,784
你上哪儿去了？
Hey, where you been?

647
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:22,726
我已经去过三家酒吧 我对三家酒吧都做了些奉献
I've been in three bars and I put a dent in all three.

648
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,399
没错！看来就像
Yeah, you look it.

649
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,058
 给我些酒  你怎么会穿制服？
  Give me a nail.   What you doing in uniform?

650
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,762
我正考虑从军
I'm thinking of joining the Army.

651
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:35,671
或许我该到墨西哥当牛仔 你愿意跟我一起去吗？
Or maybe I'll go to Mexico and become a cowboy. You want to go with me?

652
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:40,042
你再继续喝酒 就会像溶掉的蜡烛一样游泳
You keep drinking, you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

653
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:45,249
你说得很对 酒保！威士忌！大杯的
You're absolutely right. Bartender, whiskey! Large whiskey.

654
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,085
借过，老兄
Excuse me. Hey, buddy.

655
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,220
山姆
Sam!

656
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:56,488
各位！金贝地下室的怪物 就要出笼了
Coming out, fellas, the terror of Gimbel's basement.

657
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,157
让开！出个七点 五点，两点
Stand back now. A seven for Daddy. Five, deuce.

658
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,200
七点
A seven.

659
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:06,835
两个么点 那正是我一生的高潮
Snake eyes. That's the story of my life.

660
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:14,310
夏威夷皇家饭店就在附近
That's the Royal Hawaiian around the corner.

661
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,849
电影明星常在那里出现
Where all those movie stars stay.

662
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,921
你最好安静下来 你还有整个周末要过
You better simmer down. You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

663
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,988
那是你说的，兄弟
That's what you say, buddy.

664
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,821
 他们只给你过夜假条吗？  没有假条
  They only gave you an overnight pass?   No pass.

665
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:31,293
他们让我上哨 可是老安杰罗骗过他们了
They put me on guard duty. But old Angelo, he foxed them.

666
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,335
你擅离岗哨？
You walked off guard?

667
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,766
我签到之后立刻签出
I checked in and checked right out.

668
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,499
你赶快回到岗哨去 你的麻烦大了
You get your tail back to the post. You're in trouble.

669
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,941
我有个好主意 我们去跟电影明星游泳
I got a good idea. Let's go swimming with a movie star.

670
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:47,513
我正打算那么做 去跟电影明星游泳
That's what I'll do, go swimming with a movie star!

671
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,880
二十英尺高 我要去跟电影明星游泳
Twenty feet tall. I'm swimming with a movie star.

672
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,716
你最好快走吧！
You better go.

673
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,301
混球！快走来！醒醒
You jerk, get up. Wake up!

674
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,601
我是清醒的！你干嘛大吼？
I'm awake. Why are you hollering?

675
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,903
把衣服穿上
Put your clothes on.

676
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:20,480
把它们送给印第安人 他们会需要的
Give them back to the Indians. They need them.

677
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,844
他们只穿丁字裤
All they wear is G strings.

678
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,281
你没有喝醉！快起来
You ain't drunk. Get up.

679
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:32,717
我要在这里等电影明星 从饭店里出来
I am waiting here for a movie star to come out of the hotel...

680
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,898
除非她出现否则我不会走
...and I'm not going until she shows up.

681
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,895
把衣服穿上
Put your clothes on.

682
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,029
在我们惹上麻烦之前赶快离开
Let's get out of here before we get in trouble.

683
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:45,901
你是怎么回事？ 难道我不能喝醉吗？
What's the matter with you? Can't a man get drunk?

684
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,008
难道我不能做自己想做的事？
Can't a man do nothing?

685
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:54,316
难道我不能手插在口袋里 走在大街上吗？
Can't he put his lousy hands in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

686
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,213
难道我必须一生被追逐吗？
A man got to be hounded all his life?

687
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,048
我累了！我又不是罪犯
Well, I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

688
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,918
 我也不是懦夫  兄弟，你瞧
  I ain't no coward!   Buddy boy, look.

689
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,727
你把衣服穿好 快把衣服穿上
You get dressed. You put your clothes on.

690
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,993
 等我！我去叫计程车  是才怪
  Wait for me, I'll get a cab.   Yeah, sure.

691
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,862
 你会等吧？  是的，你去叫计程车
  Will you wait?   Yeah, you get a cab.

692
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,777
嗨！宪兵
Hey, MPs!

693
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,047
你们快来抓我！我在这里
Come and get me, you guys! Here I am!

694
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:43,220
你们只能这样吗？ 我想你们一定是吃脆麦片的
Is that the best you can do? I bet you guys eat Wheaties!

695
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,702
军事法庭有消息吗？
Any word on the court martial?

696
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,571
现在正在审
It's on right now.

697
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,179
他一定会被关禁闭
He'll get the stockade sure.

698
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,943
或许他不会被关 他只不过是喝醉了
Maybe he won't get it. All he did was to get drunk.

699
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:08,988
那是军人的本色 偶尔变成义务了
It's a soldier's nature, almost a duty once in a while.

700
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,988
可是他擅离职守
But he went AWOL.

701
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,821
 你为什么在这里？  男子汉不能休息吗？
  Why are you here?   Can't a man rest?

702
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:18,194
什么男子汉？你没事做吗？ 我可以派一些给你
What man? You got no work? Maybe I can scare you up some.

703
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,703
去打几杆撞球 有任何消息我会通知你
Go shoot some pool. Any word comes, I'll let you know.

704
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:35,417
参谋本部，华登上士 是的，长官
Company G, First Sergeant Warden. Yes, sir.

705
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,322
我会把他的东西准备好
I'll have his things in order.

706
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,654
他被判刑了，六个月
He got it. Six months.

707
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:05,036
金贝的地下室关不了我 禁闭室也一样关不住
Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me, neither can this stockade.

708
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,772
 闭嘴！  全听你的，女童军
  Shut up!   Whatever you say, Brownie.

709
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:11,110
囚犯！停
Prisoner, halt!

710
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,854
警卫士官长

711
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:30,234
你好，泼猴
Hello, tough monkey.

712
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:49,954
我们很幸运能租到它 这是个迎合潮流的好区
We were lucky to rent it. This is a very fashionable district.

713
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,457
我替你打了钥匙
I had a key made for you.

714
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:57,257
你随时都可以用它 就算我不在也可以
You can use it any time, even when I'm not here.

715
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:12,311
普威特就是我跟你提起的大兵 乔琪特，我的室友
Prew is the soldier I told you about. Georgette, my roommate.

716
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:13,777
欢迎你，朋友
Welcome, friend.

717
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:17,350
自从那只猫死了以后 屋里就没有男的了
There hasn't been a man around the house since the cat died.

718
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:20,488
我每次必订阅书会的书
I always take every book from the Book Club.

719
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:23,283
那是我分得红利的方式
That's the way I get all the dividends.

720
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,826
等马吉欧出禁闭室后 她会很适合他
She'll be great for Maggio when he gets out.

721
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,498
是的，他会为她疯狂
Yes, he'll be crazy about her.

722
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,729
请坐！让自己舒服一下
Just sit down and get comfortable.

723
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:39,101
我去替你调杯马丁尼 再去准备晚饭
I'll make you a martini and see about dinner.

724
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:42,744
感觉好像结了婚，对吧？
This is like being married, ain't it?

725
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,537
好比结了婚
It's better.

726
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,190
你还好吗？
You okay?

727
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,784
很高兴你来了吗？
Glad you came?

728
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,353
我们走吧！不要回头
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

729
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,587
我们不能再这样继续下去
It can't go on like this much longer.

730
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:45,730
就算是到了岛这一头 我们还是得…
Even clear across the island, we had to...

731
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,502
像囚犯一样逃跑
...run out like jail birds.

732
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,735
如果我们有办法…
If there was only a way we...

733
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:01,646
荷姆斯会让你离婚 可是他不会让我请调
Holmes'd give you a divorce, but he'd never let me transfer.

734
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,415
是有一个办法
There is a way.

735
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:11,221
我一直在考虑这件事 你必须去做军官
I've been thinking about it. You've got to become an officer.

736
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:16,729
就读新的额外课程 然后他们就会送你回美国
Take the new extension course. Then they'll ship you back to the States.

737
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,866
当军官？
An officer?

738
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:22,902
是的！这样我可以跟 唐纳离婚再嫁给你
Yes. Then I could divorce Dana and marry you.

739
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,767
我讨厌军官 我一直很讨厌军官
I hate officers! I've always hated them!

740
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:29,042
那可是个很明智的看法
That's a fine, intelligent point of view.

741
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:33,874
如果我说我讨厌上士呢？ 这样合理多了
If I said I always hated sergeants? That'd make a lot of sense.

742
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,711
你已经研究得很透澈
You sure made a complete study of it.

743
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,413
好吧！假设我是研究过 别以为这事很容易
Okay, suppose I did. And don't think it's a cinch.

744
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:46,685
我们必须分开六个月 到时我们一定会参战
We'd be apart six months! We're sure to be in a war by then.

745
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:50,991
老实说吧！你只是不想负责任
Tell the truth. You just don't want the responsibility.

746
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,861
搞不好你根本不爱我
You probably don't love me.

747
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:56,994
你疯了！真希望我不爱你 或许我可以再次享受人生
You're crazy! I wish I didn't. Maybe I could enjoy life again.

748
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,244
于是他们结了婚 从此过着不快乐的生活
So, they were married and lived unhappily ever after.

749
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,753
在我遇见你之前 我从不曾如此悲惨
I've never been so miserable as I have since I met you.

750
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,914
我也没有
Neither have I.

751
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,491
我不愿再抛弃一分钟
I wouldn't trade a minute of it.

752
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,457
我也不愿意
Neither would I.

753
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:26,031
或许我会成为 你见过最差的军官
I'll probably make the lousiest officer you ever saw.

754
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,800
你一定会是个好军官
You'll make a fine officer.

755
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,235
一个很棒的军官
A remarkable officer.

756
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,344
谢谢你
Thank you.

757
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,577
过来
Come here.

758
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,315
难道你不能等我们吃完晚餐？
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

759
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,620
 亲爱的  什么事？
  Honey.   What?

760
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,589
我想娶你
I want to marry you.

761
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,461
你真是个好玩的家伙
You're a funny one.

762
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,797
为什么有人想娶你 是件好玩的事？
Why is it funny if a guy wants to marry you?

763
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,004
因为你是在 新国会俱乐部认识我
Because you met me at the New Congress Club.

764
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,542
那只不过比最底层高一点而已
That's two steps up from the pavement.

765
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:14,580
我是什么？不过是个大兵 没有阶级的大兵
Well, what am I? I'm a private, no class dogface.

766
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:18,719
大部分的人会认为我什么都不是
Most civilians look at that as two steps up from nothing.

767
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:24,523
我以为我们很快乐 你为何要毁了这一切？
I thought we were happy. Why do you want to spoil things?

768
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:28,059
听着！我还有一年就要延役
Look, I've got a year to go before I re enlist.

769
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:32,723
如果到时候我能升为士官 我就可以回美国
If I get sergeant stripes by then, I can go back to the States.

770
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,904
到时我们可以一起回去 如果你愿意等的话
Then we can go back together if you'll wait.

771
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:39,335
你在荷姆斯手下如何升成士官？
How could you become a sergeant under Holmes?

772
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,669
你只能尽量不被关禁闭
It's all you can do to keep out of the stockade.

773
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,674
我愿意打拳击
I'll fight.

774
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,373
 不，你用不着打拳击  那是值得的
  No, you won't fight.   It'd be worth it.

775
01:14:55,791 --> 01:15:00,728
现在我们彼此是相爱 我们相互需要
It's true we love each other now, we need each other.

776
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:05,391
但回到美国，就可能大不相同
But back in the States, it might be different.

777
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,569
那不是真正的理由
That ain't the real reason.

778
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,800
 好吧！那不是  什么是真正理由？
  All right, it's not.   What is the real reason?

779
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,844
我不想成为士兵的太太
I don't want to be the wife of a soldier.

780
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:29,885
我最好只能为你做到那样
That would be about the best I could ever do for you.

781
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:36,626
因为没有人能妨碍我的计划 没有任何人或任何事
Because nobody'll stop me from my plan. Nobody, nothing.

782
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,892
 因为我想做高尚人  高尚？
  Because I want to be proper.   Proper?

783
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:41,626
是的，高尚
Yes, proper.

784
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:45,502
再过一年，我的钱就存够了
In another year, I'll have enough money.

785
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:50,303
我打算回到奥勒冈 替我妈和自己盖栋房子
Then I'll go back to Oregon and build a house for my mother and myself.

786
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:53,777
然后加入乡村俱乐部 学打高尔夫球
And join the country club and take up golf.

787
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,777
我会遇到有高尚地位的高尚男士
I'll meet the proper man with the proper position.

788
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:03,381
我将成为高尚的太太 掌高尚的家，生养高尚的孩子
I'll be a proper wife who can run a proper home and raise proper children.

789
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:08,158
我会很快乐 因为高尚的人很安全
And I'll be happy because when you're proper, you're safe.

790
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,766
你很有勇气，亲爱的
You got guts, honey.

791
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,929
我希望你能成功
I hope you can pull it off.

792
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:25,946
当我说需要你时是真心的
I do mean it when I say I need you.

793
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,809
因为我很寂寞
Because I'm lonely.

794
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,275
你认为我在说谎，对吧？
You think I'm lying, don't you?

795
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,619
没有人会用寂寞来说谎话
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

796
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,558
不要跟我提离婚的事
Don't talk to me about a divorce.

797
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:51,068
为什么？难道丑闻会 破坏你升迁的机会？
Why? Because the scandal would spoil your chances for a promotion?

798
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:54,436
我要知道对方是谁 以及你是在哪里认识他的
I want to know who he is and where you met him.

799
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:56,338
我绝对不会告诉你
I'm not going to tell you.

800
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:02,776
我知道他是个老百姓 你谨慎的不会找军人
I know he's a civilian. You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.

801
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:06,045
我不知道是你的骄傲 还是你的好奇让我重伤？
I wonder which is hurt more, your pride or your curiosity?

802
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,279
你不会知道我的感受
You can't expect to know how I feel.

803
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,618
为什么男人的感觉如此不同？
Why do men feel so differently about it?

804
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:14,261
根本完全不一样
It's just not the same.

805
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:22,127
今天天气真好，我想去散个步
It's a lovely day. I think I'll go for a walk.

806
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,841
我听说你才关完禁闭出来
I hear you just got out of the stockade.

807
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,383
那里真的很难捱 我不想再多说
It was rugged. I kept my mouth shut.

808
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:39,714
 你有见到马吉欧吗？  胖子把马吉欧折磨得很惨
  Did you see Maggio?   Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.

809
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,718
他甚至用了警棍
He's using a billy, too.

810
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:45,991
专打看不到的地方 比如说背后或胸前
In places where it won't show. On the back, on the chest.

811
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:49,891
他甚至有个系统 他还经常踢他
He's got it down to a system. He kicks him a lot too.

812
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,127
你知道马吉欧的反应如何？
You know how Maggio's taking it?

813
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,099
他一直对胖子吐口水
He just keeps spitting in Fatso's eye.

814
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,439
他真有个性，是吗？
Ain't he a hot one?

815
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:01,636
他是一个好人
He's a good man.

816
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:08,245
老胖子伤不了他 那个胖子是个聪明人
Old Fatso can't make a dent in him. That Fatso, he's smart.

817
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,409
 值星官从来看不到什么的  为什么马吉欧不向值星官报告？
  The OD never sees nothing.   Why don't Maggio go to the OD?

818
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:17,115
我们曾鼓励他去报告但他不肯 他真的很倔强
We tried to get him to, but he won't peep. He's a tough nut.

819
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,753
你认为他能平安吗？
You think he'll be all right?

820
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,124
 他可能快崩溃了  这话什么意思？
  Maybe he's cracking.   What do you mean?

821
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:26,725
胖子将他关进洞里，就是 单人牢房后…
After Fatso threw him in the hole... that's solitary...

822
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,961
他开始不停地说他要如何逃跑
...he started talking about how he'll escape.

823
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,573
他说他某个晚上会来找你
He said he'll look you up one of these nights.

824
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,876
你还趴在地上吗？普威特
Still on your knees, Prewitt?

825
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,780
拳击决赛在下个月 十二月十五日
Boxing finals next month. December 15th.

826
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,952
你还有时间帮我们赢得冠军
Still time to help us win the championship.

827
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,385
你是否以加入本军团为荣？
Are you proud to be in this company or not?

828
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:02,868
 我不会再绕过你了  看来你需要点教训
  I won't move around you again.   Something tells me you need a lesson.

829
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,631
或许我会亲自教训你
Maybe I'll give it to you myself.

830
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:13,781
别惹他！他是我小队上的人 如果你打架，麻烦可就大了
Leave him alone, he's in my detail. You'll get in trouble if you fight.

831
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:16,075
 回去工作  别挡路
  Get back to work.   Get out of the way!

832
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:48,839
我很乐意提供推荐信
I'll be glad to give my recommendation.

833
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,109
你有功绩，经验和官阶
You've got service, experience, grade.

834
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,753
 你一定会成为好军官  谢谢你，长官
  You'll make an excellent officer.   Thank you, sir.

835
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:57,152
军团里能有你这种人 也是值得让我骄傲的事
A feather in my cap too. A man from my company.

836
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,153
出了什么事？
What's the trouble?

837
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:05,466
葛罗维奇和普威特 他们在外头打架，长官
They're fighting outside, sir. Galovitch and Prewitt.

838
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,135
葛罗维奇会杀了他，长官
Galovitch's going to murder him, sir.

839
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,860
我会处理
I'll take care of it.

840
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:18,611
 难道你不想看吗？  不想！你也别看！出去
  Don't you want to see?   No! Nor you, either! Get out!

841
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:30,915
 为什么普威特不打他的头？  他曾打瞎某个人所以很害怕
  Why don't Prew go for his head?   He blinded a guy once, he's scared.

842
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,266
揍他的脸
Hit him in the face!

843
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,849
 拜托！葛罗维奇！公平竞赛！  我想怎么打都行
  Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!   I'll fight any way I want.

844
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:43,491
那位军官应该阻止这场架 他叫什么名字？
That officer should stop the fight. What's his name?

845
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:45,461
荷姆斯上尉，长官
Captain Holmes, sir.

846
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,621
稍息！是谁先动手的？
At ease. What started this?

847
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,731
普威特违抗我给他的命令
Prewitt refused order I gave him.

848
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:23,098
开始顶嘴并且挑衅 所以我才会教训他
Talked back and started a fight. I taught him a lesson.

849
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,136
你不可以再抗命
You won't disobey any more orders.

850
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:30,107
长官！这件事不能怪普威特 是葛罗维奇上士起头的
I'm sorry, sir, but Prewitt's not to blame. Sergeant Galovitch started it.

851
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,006
索希尔，这个小队是你带的 到底怎么回事？
Thornhill. You're in charge of this detail. What about it?

852
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:38,208
 他说得对，普威特没有犯错  是葛罗维奇起的头
  He's right. Prewitt did nothing.   Galovitch started it.

853
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:43,214
够了！这事算了 回去做自己的工作
That's all. Let's forget it. Let's get back to our jobs.

854
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,918
好了！回去工作 动作快！解散
All right, back to work. Let's go. Break it up.

855
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,461
如果你认为这样我就会出赛 你就错了
If you think this means I'll fight, you're wrong.

856
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:56,228
你的伤口最好擦点碘酒
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

857
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:43,349
星期五，你怎么会叫星期五？
Hey, Friday. Why're you called "Friday"?

858
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,714
我也不知道 我是在星期三生的
I don't know. I was born on a Wednesday.

859
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,287
普威特，你要去哪里？
Prewitt, where are you going?

860
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:02,930
什么意思？我要去裘伊酒吧 再多买罐啤酒
What do you mean? I'm going to Choy's to get me another beer.

861
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,442
别动！
Halt!

862
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,939
谁在那里？
Who goes there?

863
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:26,345
 一个朋友  朋友，请你上前表明身份
  A friend.   Advance, friend, and be recognized!

864
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:37,962
立正！
Ten hut!

865
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,233
向后转！向后转走！
About face! Rear face!

866
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:44,462
跪下！刷地板
On your knees! Scrub the floor!

867
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,531
稍息
At ease.

868
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:52,876
小子，你一个人在这做什么？
Hello, kid. What you doing out here all by yourself?

869
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:59,286
 我去买酒  坐下！我还有一瓶
  I'm getting a little drink.   Sit down. I got a bottle.

870
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:07,617
谢谢，军士长
Thanks, top.

871
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:13,664
我一定得称赞你 揍葛罗维奇的方法，小子
I got to hand it to you, kid, the way you beat up old Galovitch.

872
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:17,163
可惜他们迟早会扳倒你
Too bad they got to get you sooner or later.

873
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:27,604
生命就是这么烂，你知道吗？
Life's crummy, you know it?

874
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:31,478
是的，长官，是很悲惨 非常地悲惨
Yes, sir, it's miserable, perfectly miserable.

875
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:37,287
如果现在有辆卡车 开过来撞上我们怎么办？
What would happen if a truck came along and ran us over?

876
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:41,962
 我们就死定了  你最好别再坐在这里
  We'd be dead.   You better not sit here anymore.

877
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,529
起来坐到路旁去
Get up and sit over on the side.

878
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:47,030
你在说什么？我…可是…
What do you mean, I? But...

879
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:51,830
你比我更需要活下去 你还得照顾整个军团
You've got more to live for than me, a whole company to take care of.

880
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,236
你快移到路旁
You move over to the other side.

881
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:56,933
我年纪比较大，死了没关系
I'm older, it don't matter if I die.

882
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:59,705
现在别争了！快点起来
Now, don't argue. Go on, get up.

883
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:04,851
不！长官！普威特不去 普威特决定待到苦果的最后
No, sir, not Prewitt. Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

884
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:10,319
好吧！我们一起留在这里
Okay, we'll stay together.

885
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:16,830
反正我也站不起来
I couldn't have got up anyway.

886
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:24,230
我惹了世界上最大的麻烦
I got the biggest troubles in the whole world.

887
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:27,138
世界级的吗？
In the whole world, huh?

888
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,470
都是因为爱
Take love.

889
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,275
你曾经见过爱情吗？
Did you personally ever see any of this love?

890
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:37,980
你不明白我的意思 这个女孩…
You don't understand what I mean. This girl, see...

891
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,817
她要求我成为…
...she wants me to become...

892
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,814
 成为什么？  一名军官
  Become what?   An officer.

893
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:46,755
你能想像我当军官的样子吗？
Can you see me as an officer?

894
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:51,430
可以！我能想像你当军官 你一定会是个好军官
Yeah, I can see you as an officer. You'd be a good officer.

895
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:54,568
你们两个比我有远见
You both can see more than I can see.

896
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:58,170
我不想当军官 我很喜欢现在这样
I don't want to be an officer. I'm happy where I am.

897
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,866
搞不好我会变成荷姆斯那种人
I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

898
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:06,504
你不希望我跟荷姆斯一样吧？
You wouldn't want me to be like Holmes, would you?

899
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,010
你会吗？
Well, would you?

900
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,947
男人应该做自己在行的事
A man should be what he can do.

901
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:30,097
你的女朋友呢？ 再告诉我一次她的芳名
How's your girl? What's her name again?

902
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:35,439
 萝琳  对了！就是萝琳
  Lorene.   Oh, yeah, Lorene.

903
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:39,943
我现在想起来了 好美的名字
I remember now. Beautiful name.

904
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:42,213
美极了
Beautiful.

905
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,217
你们两个愚蠢的疯家伙
You two dumb, crazy screwballs.

906
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:54,156
你们想找死吗？ 你们在这里做什么？
You trying to get killed? What're you doing here?

907
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:57,798
我的朋友普威特跟我 坐在这里讨论天气
My friend Prew and I are sitting here discussing the weather.

908
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,967
你的朋友？
Your friend, huh?

909
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,762
你得好好照顾这个人
You got to take care of this man.

910
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:06,030
荷姆斯迟早会整倒他
Holmes is bound to get him sooner or later.

911
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,868
他是陆军最棒的士兵
And he's the best soldier in the Army.

912
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,637
你们两个都晕头了
You both got rocks in your head.

913
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,909
安杰罗！安杰罗
Angelo, Angelo!

914
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:24,019
我就知道你一定在裘伊酒吧
I figured you'd be here at Choy's.

915
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,494
我办到了！普威特
I done it, Prew.

916
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:31,461
正如我所说的，我逃出来了 跟我所计划的一样
I escaped, just like I said. Just like I figured.

917
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:34,633
跳上了卡车，躲在防水布下面
In a back of a truck, under a tarp.

918
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:38,836
跟我所计划的一样 他们开车把我也载了出来
They rode me right out, just like I figured.

919
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:44,704
可惜离这儿一哩后，后挡泥板 就掉了，所以我跌到路上
Only the tailgate opened up about a mile back, and I fell out in the road.

920
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:50,179
你应该看我弹跳的样子 我应该有骨折才对
You should've seen me bounce. I must've broke something.

921
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,051
普威特，听我说
Prew, listen.

922
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,627
胖子做的，普威特
Fatso done it, Prew.

923
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,921
他很喜欢修理我
He likes to whack me in the gut.

924
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:07,927
一如往常，他问我会不会痛 然后我直接对着他吐口水
He asks me if it hurts and I spit at him like always.

925
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:11,663
只是昨天，情况很糟
Only yesterday, it was bad.

926
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:16,502
他不断的打我
He hit me, he hit me, he hit me.

927
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:21,679
我一定要出来，普威特 我一定要出来
I had to get out, Prew, I had to get out.

928
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:26,381
 他们会送你回禁闭室  不，他们不会
  They'll send you to the stockade.   No, they won't.

929
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:30,614
小心胖子！要小心胖子
Watch out for Fatso. Watch out for Fatso.

930
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:32,520
他想要修理你
He'll try to crack you.

931
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:34,991
如果他们把你关进单人牢里
If they put you in the hole...

932
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:38,858
千万别大叫，不要出声
...don't yell, don't make a sound.

933
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:43,064
否则当他们把你拉出来时 你还是在叫
You'll still be yelling when they come to take you out.

934
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,268
你只管躺在那里
Just lay there...

935
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:50,009
安安静静地躺在那里，普威特
...just lay there and be quiet, Prew.

936
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,717
他死了
He's dead.

937
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:38,484
我打赌那一定是普威特
I'll bet you that's Prew.

938
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:02,530
贾德森上士
Sergeant Judson?

939
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:05,061
你找我吗？
You want me?

940
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,230
是的，胖子
Yeah, Fatso.

941
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:12,075
我不喜欢那个外号 你找我有什么事吗？
I don't like that nickname. You want to see me about something?

942
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:15,807
我们找个角落好好谈谈
Let's step around the corner where we can talk.

943
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:30,897
你在生气什么吗？
Are you sore about something?

944
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:34,330
我不喜欢你弹琴的方式
I don't like the way you play the piano.

945
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:40,603
 还记得马吉欧吗？  意大利佬？记得！那个泼猴
  Remember Maggio?   The wop? Yeah, real tough monkey.

946
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:43,333
 你杀了他  我有吗？
  You killed him.   Did I?

947
01:34:43,544 --> 01:34:45,603
如果我有，也是他咎由自取
If I did, he asked for it.

948
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:48,873
军队迟早会惩罚你
The Army's going to get you sooner or later.

949
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:52,280
可是在他们动手之前 我想先找你算算帐
But before they do, I want a piece of you myself.

950
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:55,679
我早知道了
I figured that.

951
01:34:56,624 --> 01:35:00,720
看到这把刀了吗？ 是你先前威胁马吉欧时所用的
See this knife? It's the one you pulled on Maggio.

952
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:38,652
出了什么事？
What's happened?

953
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,061
没事了
It's all right.

954
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:52,567
别担心！别担心！我死不了
Don't worry. Don't worry. I ain't going to die.

955
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:07,820
仍然不知道谋杀 警卫上士的凶手是谁

956
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:11,915
全数到齐
All present and accounted for!

957
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:13,855
全数到齐
All present and accounted for!

958
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:16,120
全数到齐
All present and accounted for!

959
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:18,321
全数到齐
All present and accounted for!

960
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:20,560
全数到齐
All present and accounted for!

961
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:22,326
全数到齐
All present and accounted for!

962
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,133
队伍解散
Company dismissed!

963
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,373
普威特还是没有出席
Prewitt's still absent.

964
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,615
已经三天了
Makes three days now.

965
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:40,781
你还要替他瞒多久？
How long will you carry him present?

966
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:44,556
 我只是说说  那么就别再说了
  I just mention it.   Well, don't mention it.

967
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:50,693
将军室

968
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,691
督察长展开调查…
"Upon these incidents, an investigation was made...

969
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:58,565
这些事件数个月
...by the inspector general over several months.

970
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:02,572
发现荷姆斯上尉 对普威特士兵残酷的罪行
Captain Holmes was found guilty of indefensible cruelty...

971
01:38:02,776 --> 01:38:04,471
是无可辩解的
...to Private Prewitt.

972
01:38:04,678 --> 01:38:08,580
其中包括唆使运用 未经许可的方式
This included the instigation of unauthorized tactics...

973
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:12,582
意图强迫他参加军团拳击赛
...to force him to join the inter regiment boxing team."

974
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,992
 我正在等你回答  我无话可说，长官
  I'm waiting for your reply.   I haven't any, sir.

975
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:25,457
荷姆斯，我在军队中 学习到的第一件事
Holmes, the first thing I learned in the Army...

976
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:28,294
就是军官要好好照顾部属
...was that an officer takes care of his men.

977
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:31,198
但这似乎是你最早忘记的事
It seems to be the first thing you forgot.

978
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:34,169
我很遗憾必须让你保留军职
I regret that we have to keep you in uniform...

979
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,741
直到军事法庭做出判决
...until a court martial is concluded.

980
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:40,573
若有办法能免除上军事法庭…
If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir...

981
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:44,646
如果你愿意的话，将军 我倒有另一项选择
There is one alternative, general, if you are so disposed.

982
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:49,448
依照陆军规定辞职
A resignation for the good of the service under Army regulations.

983
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:54,025
下午就提出辞呈
Write a letter of resignation for this afternoon.

984
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:58,688
你愈快离开陆军 对大家愈有利
The quicker you're out of the Army, the better for everybody.

985
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:01,026
尤其是对陆军
Especially the Army.

986
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:04,400
就这样决定，荷姆斯
That's all, Holmes.

987
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:16,710
我很清楚事情的发展 也知道你有多么过份
I know what's been going on, how far some of you have been out of line.

988
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:20,019
如果你还想继任无委任状士官 就得赶紧努力
If you want to remain non coms, snap into it.

989
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:25,283
从现在开始 拳击已无法替任何人赢得官阶
From now on, no man's going to earn his stripes by boxing.

990
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:30,158
 把那些扔掉  是的，长官
  Get rid of those.   Yes, sir.

991
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:31,954
解散！
Dismissed.

992
01:39:38,038 --> 01:39:40,063
 关于葛罗维奇上士  是的，长官
  About Sergeant Galovitch.   Yes, sir.

993
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:43,004
将他降级为葛罗维奇大兵
Bust him. He is now Private Galovitch.

994
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:47,203
派他去管厕所 你在笑什么？
Put him in charge of the latrine. What are you grinning at?

995
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:50,542
军团连长做了明智决定
The company commander made a wise decision, sir.

996
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,115
参谋部，罗斯上尉
Company G, Captain Ross.

997
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,555
请等一下！你的电话
Just a minute. It's for you.

998
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:00,249
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

999
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:05,062
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1000
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:11,404
是的，包裹已经到了
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

1001
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,268
什么？
What?

1002
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,738
我必须见你一面 这件事很重要
I've got to see you. It's important.

1003
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,976
好的，我想办法去 当然，没有问题
Okay, I'll get away somehow. Sure, that'd be fine.

1004
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:26,746
我一小时之内赶到
I'll be there in about an hour.

1005
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:33,251
他下礼拜就要被送回去
He's being sent back next week.

1006
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:36,452
他要我跟他一起走 我们怎么办？
He wants me to go with him. What'll we do?

1007
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,167
你何时能拿到派令？
When will you get your commission?

1008
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:48,801
我没有申请 我是填好了但并没有签名
I didn't put it in. I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.

1009
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:52,604
我把它拿出来许多次 但就是无法签名
I took it out a dozen times, but I couldn't sign it.

1010
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:54,937
为什么？
Why?

1011
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:58,778
 这是我们的计划  我知道…
  But it was the plan.   I know, I know.

1012
01:40:58,986 --> 01:41:02,547
你不能光说不做
You can't just say you'll do a thing and then not do it.

1013
01:41:02,756 --> 01:41:04,053
凯伦，听我说
Karen, listen to me.

1014
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:07,352
你为什么不申请？ 你为什么不告诉我？
Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you tell me?

1015
01:41:08,829 --> 01:41:10,490
我马上回来
Be back in a minute.

1016
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:16,034
对不起，我以为你是某人
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

1017
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:25,542
我以为是我们军团的普威特
I thought it was that kid Prewitt from our company.

1018
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,476
他迷上俱乐部的女孩
He got mixed up with a girl at the club.

1019
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:31,378
他不假外出，可能有大麻烦
He's AWOL, probably in lots of trouble.

1020
01:41:31,985 --> 01:41:35,113
罗勃普威特是个疯狂的坏家伙
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no good...

1021
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:41,722
凯伦，我不是当军官的料 我是个军人
Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.

1022
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:45,194
别的事我都做不来 我一定只会装装样子
I can't be anything else. I'd be putting on an act.

1023
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:48,562
我就是办不到 请不要问我原因
I just can't do it. Please don't ask me why.

1024
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:52,601
我知道原因
I know why.

1025
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:57,972
因为现在唐纳已经离开军队 所以你用不着去当军官
You don't have to become an officer now that Dana's out of the Army.

1026
01:41:58,212 --> 01:42:00,578
你就是不想娶我
You just don't want to marry me.

1027
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:03,306
你已经结了婚 娶了陆军
You're already married. To the Army.

1028
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:05,246
我是爱你的，凯伦
I love you, Karen.

1029
01:42:10,824 --> 01:42:12,951
我知道…
I know. I know.

1030
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:19,566
 我不希望你回到他身边  我也不想但我是在他身边
  I don't want you to go back to him.   I don't want to, either, but I am.

1031
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:22,132
我已经无能为力
There's nothing else for me to do.

1032
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:25,362
对我们并没有好处 从来不可能有好结果
It's no good with us. It could never have been.

1033
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:29,167
这样东躲西藏 磨耗了我们的感情
The hiding and the sneaking. It had to wear out.

1034
01:42:33,013 --> 01:42:34,537
再见了，上士
Goodbye, sergeant.

1035
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:37,874
 谢谢  这不是再见而是…
  Thanks.   It ain't goodbye, it's...

1036
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:41,986
总有一天我们会再某处重逢
We'll see each other again, somewhere.

1037
01:42:42,789 --> 01:42:44,689
我们当然会
Of course we will.

1038
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:46,519
就在某处
Somewhere.

1039
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:04,407
有消息了！已经登在内页
Here it is. They got it on the inside page already.

1040
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:10,049
“谋杀詹姆士贾德森上士凶手 至今仍毫无线索”
"Still no clue in the fatal stabbing of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson."

1041
01:43:10,717 --> 01:43:12,412
你听见我说的吗？
Did you hear me?

1042
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:18,456
你想创下新世界纪录吗？
You trying to set a new world's record?

1043
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,027
是的，我就是这么打算
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

1044
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,355
纪念罗勃普威特
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt...

1045
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,769
新世界纪录保持人
...holder of the new world's record.

1046
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:48,716
 还好吗？军士长  好极了
  Everything all right, top?   Great.

1047
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:54,525
这是在星期天的一顿美味餐 恭喜你了
A beautiful meal to put in front of a guy on Sunday. Congratulations.

1048
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:12,141
 从山上看下去真美  说得也是？
  They look pretty over the mountains.   Don't they?

1049
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,883
他们要轰炸车轮草原吗？
Are they dynamiting Wheeler Field?

1050
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:28,084
真是有野心，是吧？ 星期天早上还不到八点钟
Mighty ambitious, huh? Sunday morning before 8:00.

1051
01:44:40,173 --> 01:44:43,540
日本战机正在轰炸车轮草原
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!

1052
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:46,713
我看到红圆圈…
I seen the red circles on the...

1053
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:19,772
到里面去！快一点！
Get inside! Hurry up, go!

1054
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:28,410
这是真的，不是演习 日本人正在轰炸珍珠港
<i>This is real, not a maneuver.</i> <i>The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.</i>

1055
01:45:28,622 --> 01:45:30,988
请留在室内！不要任意外出
<i>Keep in your homes. Do not go out.</i>

1056
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:36,288
日本战正在轰炸 我方的海军及陆军设施
<i>Japanese planes are bombing</i> <i>our Naval and Army installations.</i>

1057
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:41,627
好了！各位！安静！安静下来
All right, you guys, quiet down. Quiet. Quiet down!

1058
01:45:41,902 --> 01:45:45,861
士官们，快去拿机关枪和弹药 然后到屋顶上去
Non coms, get B A Rs and ammunition and get up on the roof.

1059
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:50,442
韩德生，你负责装填子弹 动作快一点
Henderson, you're in charge of the loading detail. Get moving.

1060
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:55,281
其他人快去拿步枪 然后回卧铺去，留在那里别动
The rest of you, get your rifle, go to your bunk and stay there.

1061
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:57,609
我要你们留在那里
And I mean stay there!

1062
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:00,517
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1063
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:04,914
你们到外面会被击中 你们有机会成为英雄
You'll be shot outside! You'll get a chance to be heroes.

1064
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:09,528
在夜晚来临之前 日本人就会坐在你的大腿上！快
There'll be Japs in your lap before night. Now get moving!

1065
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:17,696
去煮一壶咖啡 等一下！煮一桶咖啡
Go make a pot of coffee. Wait a minute, a barrel of coffee!

1066
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:40,693
没有命令我不能发给弹药
I can't issue ammo without an order.

1067
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:43,761
 可是上尉不在营里  很抱歉
  But the captain ain't here!   I'm sorry.

1068
01:46:43,964 --> 01:46:48,799
 怎么回事？列瓦  我奉命如此！陆军规定…
  What's the matter, Leva?   I got orders! Army regulations say...

1069
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:56,074
 你瞎了吗？把钥匙拿来  我奉命如此
  You blind? Give me the keys!   I got orders!

1070
01:46:56,276 --> 01:47:00,007
 我会看着你得到勋章！冲开  我警告过你
  I'll see you get a medal! Bust it.   I warned you!

1071
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:28,236
 别出去！你会没命的  快点穿衣服！你会着凉的
  Don't go out there! You'll die!   Get dressed. You'll catch cold.

1072
01:47:55,068 --> 01:47:58,902
快帮他们处理弹药 把那个东西放在那边
Help them with this ammo! Put that stuff over there.

1073
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:07,280
小心开火！瞄准飞机前方
Watch your fire and lead those planes!

1074
01:48:27,567 --> 01:48:30,092
他正在吹“骑兵突袭乐”
He's blowing the "Cavalry Charge"!

1075
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:35,698
他们来了！各位
Here they come, boys!

1076
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:09,932
 我打中他了！我打中他了  我打中他了
  I got him! I got him!   I got him.

1077
01:49:18,919 --> 01:49:21,387
入侵的危机仍然存在
<i>The danger of invasion still exists.</i>

1078
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:26,616
雪菲德部队在数小时内移防 并已就滩头位置
<i>Schofield units moved out within hours</i> <i>and have manned beach positions.</i>

1079
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:30,557
这不是演习！这是真正打仗
<i>This is no maneuver.</i> <i>This is the real McCoy.</i>

1080
01:49:30,764 --> 01:49:33,961
小心榴霰弹！快找掩护
<i>Look out for falling shrapnel.</i> <i>Keep under cover.</i>

1081
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:37,864
将实施灯火管制及宵禁
<i>Blackout and curfew restrictions</i> <i>will be enforced.</i>

1082
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:41,006
请留在家中并不要使用电话
<i>Stay in your homes.</i> <i>Don't use the phone.</i>

1083
01:49:42,275 --> 01:49:44,766
我们传播所有资讯…
<i>We'll relay all information...</i>

1084
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:48,010
我们捐血了
We've been giving blood.

1085
01:49:48,214 --> 01:49:51,308
 简直混乱极了  库希欧有房子遭到轰炸
  It's a madhouse!   A house got bombed on Kuhio.

1086
01:49:51,518 --> 01:49:55,614
一间杂货店被夷为平地 有对夫妇因而丧生
And a drugstore smashed flat! A man and his wife were killed.

1087
01:49:55,822 --> 01:50:00,122
请各位注意 注意听好并保持镇静
<i>Your attention, please.</i> <i>Listen carefully and keep calm.</i>

1088
01:50:00,327 --> 01:50:03,524
入侵的危机仍然存在
<i>The danger of invasion still exists.</i>

1089
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:07,564
进行轰炸的飞机 已确认属日方所有
<i>And the planes have been</i> <i>identified as Japanese...</i>

1090
01:50:08,234 --> 01:50:10,702
他们以为在向谁挑衅？
Who do they think they're fighting?

1091
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:14,340
他们正在对抗 世界上最精良的陆军
They're fighting the best Army in the world.

1092
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:19,475
 你要上哪儿去？  我必须回去…
  Where are you going?   I gotta get back to...

1093
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,139
 我必须回部队去  部队？为什么？
  I gotta get back to the company.   The company? But why?

1094
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:28,549
 为什么？  不可以！你还没有复原
  Why?   But you can't. You're not well yet.

1095
01:50:28,755 --> 01:50:31,451
你会被关到禁闭室
And you'll be thrown in the stockade.

1096
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:35,223
他们需要所有能用的人手
They need every guy they can get.

1097
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:40,092
但你的伤口会裂开 他们会知道是你杀了那个士官
But your side will open up. They'll find out you killed that soldier.

1098
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:45,099
只要我向部队报到 他们就会照顾我的
Once I report in to the company, they'll take care of me.

1099
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:48,672
你绝对到不了的 到处都有人在巡逻
You'll never make it! There's patrols all over!

1100
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:51,935
我到得了！我知道捷径
I'll make it. I know a shortcut.

1101
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:59,115
留到天亮再说吧！ 或许你会改变心意
Stay till morning. Maybe you'll change your mind.

1102
01:51:06,726 --> 01:51:10,662
普威特，不要走 我会照你的话去做
Oh, Prew, don't go! I'll do anything you want!

1103
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:16,160
我们可以一起回美国 甚至我们可以结婚
We can go back to the States together. We can even get married.

1104
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:23,932
 若你走了，我再也见不到你  对不起
  Lf you go, I'll never see you again.   I'm sorry.

1105
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:31,680
你为什么想回去？
Why do you want to go back?

1106
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:34,376
陆军根本视你如粪土…
The Army treated you like dirt...

1107
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:38,353
经常殴打你，还害你朋友丧命
...gave you an awful going over, got your friend killed!

1108
01:51:38,558 --> 01:51:40,549
你为什么想回去？
Why do you want to go back?

1109
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:43,593
我为什么想回去？ 因为我是军人
Why do I want to go back? I'm a soldier.

1110
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:49,400
军人！一个常备兵！一个陆军！ 一个准备当兵三十年的人！
A soldier! A regular. From the regular Army! A 30 year man!

1111
01:51:51,304 --> 01:51:55,536
外面正在实施灯火管制 所以我得把灯关掉
I gotta turn off the lights because of the blackout outside.

1112
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:13,182
 山上有伞兵降落  我并不担心他们
  Parachutists landed in the hills.   They don't worry me.

1113
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:18,592
 我担心的是破坏份子  我打赌他们一定遍布全岛
  Saboteurs is what worries me.   I bet they're all over the islands.

1114
01:53:31,771 --> 01:53:33,068
不要动！
Halt!

1115
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:36,936
不要动！
Halt!

1116
01:53:48,588 --> 01:53:49,612
不要动！
Halt!

1117
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:30,425
 你认识这个人吗？上士  是的，长官
  Do you know this man, sergeant?   Yes, sir.

1118
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:35,226
他没有任何身分证明 他们找到有他名字的卡片
He didn't have any regular I.D. They found a card with his name.

1119
01:54:35,435 --> 01:54:39,531
好像是俱乐部的会员证 新国会俱乐部
Seems to be a membership in a club. The New Congress Club.

1120
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:42,237
你最好处理一下
You'd better take care of this.

1121
01:54:46,012 --> 01:54:47,411
他是你的朋友吗？
Was he your friend?

1122
01:54:47,614 --> 01:54:51,607
他一定是想回到海滩上的部队
He must've been trying to reach our company up the beach.

1123
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:53,479
那么为什么他不停止？
Then why didn't he halt?

1124
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:56,655
他是死脑筋但却是个好军人
He was a hard head, but he was a good soldier.

1125
01:54:56,856 --> 01:55:00,019
他是我认识的所有人中 最爱陆军的
He loved the Army more than anyone else I knew.

1126
01:55:00,226 --> 01:55:03,218
我明白了，很遗憾，上士
I see. I'm sorry, sergeant.

你就是不能从善如流
You just couldn't play it smart.

1128
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:26,246
不过是要你打拳罢了 可是你这个死脑筋就是不肯
All you had to do is box, but no, not you, you hard head.

01:55:26,452 --> 01:55:30,980
好笑的是，今年没有拳击冠军
Funny thing is, there won't be a boxing championship this year.

1130
01:55:37,897 --> 01:55:43,529
没有看过死人吗？ 把尸体抬出去
Ain't you ever seen a dead man? Let's get this body out of here!

1131
01:56:05,391 --> 01:56:07,518
真美，是吧？
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

我想这是我此生见过 最美的一个地方

1135
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:30,777
如果花环漂向海岸 表示你还会再回来
If they float in toward shore, you'll come back.

1136
01:56:31,184 --> 01:56:33,448
如果是向外漂，你就不会回来
If they float out, you won't.

1137

You see, my fiancé was killed on December 7 th.

1139
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:51,330
 真是遗憾  他原是个轰炸机飞行员
  Oh, I'm sorry.   He was a bomber pilot.

1140
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:54,529
当他把飞机滑到停机坪边缘…
He taxied his plane to the edge of the apron...

1141
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:57,232
日军直接击中他
...and the Japs made a direct hit on it.

1142
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,639
或许你曾在报上看过消息
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

1143
01:57:01,047 --> 01:57:03,607
他获授银星勋章
He was awarded the Silver Star.

1144
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:08,946
军方将勋章送给他母亲 她写信给我，要我保留它
They sent it to his mother. She wrote me she wanted me to have it.

1145
01:57:09,422 --> 01:57:11,652
她真好
That's very fine of her.

1146
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:15,586
