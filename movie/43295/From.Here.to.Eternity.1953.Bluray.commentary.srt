00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,845
Hi, I'm Tim Zinnemann.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,017
I'm Fred Zinnemann's son,
here to talk about From Here to Eternity,

4
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,977
or at least what I know about it.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,979
And I'm sitting here with Alvin Sargent,

6
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:26,359
who has not only worked
with my father on Julia,

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:31,614
but we also worked together on a picture
called Straight Time with Dustin Hoffman.

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,703
He can tell you more about it than I can,

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:42,750
because he was a soldier who was shot
during the attack in the movie.

10
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:49,090
I introduced the World War II to the film,

11
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,137
and I can't imagine why I'm even here,
given how it all began.

12
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,141
In 1952,

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,435
a telephone call

14
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,310
a telephone call

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,527
from a casting director
at Columbia, Max Arnow,

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,613
found me one afternoon and said,

17
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,908
"I have a part for you
in From Here to Eternity."

18
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,287
I said, "I'm not an actor any more.
I haven't been an actor for years."

19
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,497
He said, "Well, we have your picture here.

20
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:27,086
"Somebody must have dropped it off
about two years ago.

21
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,340
"Buddy Adler wants you to come over
to Hawaii tomorrow morning

22
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,176
"and be in this movie."

23
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,219
I said, "I can't. I have a job.

24
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,848
"I'm selling advertising at Daily Variety
and I can't be there."

25
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,517
He said, "Buddy Adler insists
that you be there,

26
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,896
"and we'll give you $400
for a week's work."

27
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,898
And that's how it began.

28
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,359
That's why I'm sitting here today
with Tim Zinnemann.

29
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,990
I wanted to talk a little bit about
the background to From Here to Eternity,

30
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,118
for those who might not be aware of it.

31
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,787
The movie was based on
an 800-page book by James Jones,

32
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,874
The movie was based on
an 800-page book by James Jones,

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,461
which, in its day,
was a big, huge best seller.

34
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,840
Also, it was highly critical of the Army,

35
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,387
and it had a lot of things in it
that for the day were considered scandalous,

36
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,307
like adulterous affairs, etcetera.

37
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,811
So it was viewed in Hollywood

38
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:29,816
as a project that would
not actually ever be made,

39
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,154
and it became known as "Coho's Folly"
for Harry Cohn,

40
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,783
who bought the book for Columbia.

41
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,577
At the time that he bought it,

42
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:48,084
he did not even have the rights
from the Army to get their cooperation.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,134
It was a venture that people thought
would never actually get started,

44
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,679
and it foundered
at a couple of other studios.

45
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:06,978
A young writer named Dan Taradash
was hired to do a script

46
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,398
and worked with the producer, Buddy Adler,

47
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,485
and turned in, apparently,
an amazing first draft

48
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,406
that everybody thought extremely highly of.

49
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:24,537
As a result, they decided to fast track
the movie and start immediately.

50
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,585
My father, Fred Zinnemann,
had just come off High Noon,

51
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,881
so he was considered
an up-and-coming director.

52
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,136
Prior to that, he'd been known
as a director's director

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,929
or an art-house director.

54
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:46,475
Meaning, basically, you make good pictures,
but they don't make any money.

55
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,898
So he was really not anybody's first choice,

56
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:56,319
except Dan Taradash's,
who insisted that Cohn meet him.

57
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,825
So my father read the script, which he loved,
and went in to see Harry Cohn,

58
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:10,750
who ran Columbia with an iron fist,
and he was quite the tyrant

59
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:16,005
and basically insisted
on getting his own way.

60
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:21,510
So he talked to my father about the script,
and my father said he loved it

61
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,138
and would be very interested in directing it.

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:31,187
Cohn then said,
"I have a young actor under contract here

63
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:37,777
"who's going to play the part of Prewitt.
The girls love him. He's a boxer.

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,948
"He's on salary
and hasn't worked in 10 weeks,

65
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,534
"so I gotta put him to work
and his name is Aldo Ray."

66
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,789
My father just sort of said nothing
and sniffed.

67
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,126
Cohn said, "What's the matter?"

68
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,922
My father said, "I don't think
he's right for the part."

69
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,095
Cohn said, "Then who would you suggest?"

70
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,515
My father said, "Montgomery Clift."

71
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,814
Apparently Cohn went into a rage
and he said, "Well, Clift can't box,

72
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,234
"he doesn't look like a soldier,

73
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,737
"and for all I know,
he's probably a homosexual.

74
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,405
"And for all I know,
he's probably a homosexual.

75
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,867
"Absolutely not. That's the most
ridiculous suggestion I ever heard."

76
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:33,207
My father said, "If I can't cast this picture
the way I think it should be cast,

77
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,544
"I think it's a wonderful script,

78
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,172
"and what you should probably do
is get another director.

79
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,008
"Thank you very much."

80
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:48,222
Cohn said, "I'm the president of Columbia.
Nobody gives me ultimatums.

81
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,932
"Get out."

82
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:54,103
So my father reported in
to his agent, who is Abe Lastfogel,

83
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,731
the head of William Morris,

84
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,858
and said, "I just don't think
it's going to work.

85
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:03,279
"I love the project,
but we just don't see eye to eye here.

86
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:08,117
"I'm not going to do a picture
with a cast that I don't like.

87
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,369
"So, I'm going to pass on the project."

88
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,456
"So, I'm going to pass on the project."

89
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,585
Lastfogel said, "I completely
understand your point of view.

90
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,462
"You're absolutely right."

91
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,967
Then, Lastfogel got on the phone to Cohn

92
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,386
and said, "Freddy loves the picture
and he can hardly wait to start."

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,764
and said, "Freddy loves the picture
and he can hardly wait to start."

94
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:36,062
Much to my father's amazement,
he was given a contract, which he signed.

95
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,856
Cohn sent the script to Clift

96
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,652
and the rest is on the screen
as you see it today.

97
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:50,201
In terms of other ideas for casting,

98
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,998
Ronald Reagan was among those
considered for the part of the captain,

99
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,420
as was Walter Matthau
and some others that I can't quite remember.

100
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,379
As was Walter Matthau
and some others that I can't quite remember.

101
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:09,804
Joan Crawford was considered to be
the lead choice for the Deborah Kerr part.

102
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,017
But my father and Buddy Adler and Taradash

103
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,939
wanted to find somebody against type,

104
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,440
because they thought it would
be much more interesting

105
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,192
because they thought it would
be much more interesting

106
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,322
to have somebody as the adulterous wife

107
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:32,910
who was actually quite prim and proper

108
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,877
and who had a very nice demeanour,
so to speak.

109
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,048
So that's why Deborah Kerr was cast.

110
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,974
Who is that?

111
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,725
She's Captain Holmes' wife.

112
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,436
I never met her.

113
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:04,817
The only actors I met were Monty Clift

114
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:11,866
in the scene that I had to do for Buddy Adler.

115
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,994
- But was that cut out of the movie?
- No, it's in the movie.

116
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,162
Which is it?

117
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:21,750
No, it's a scene in which I announce
to Monty Clift

118
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:29,466
that Frank Sinatra's in the brig
and Fatso is beating him up.

119
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,219
It's on the grass,
just before the big fight.

120
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,268
There's a couple of other things
I could mention here.

121
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,190
When Cohn was first developing the script,

122
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:48,360
and Buddy Adler, who had been in the Army,
I believe,

123
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:54,241
was able to get the Army's permission
to do this very controversial story,

124
00:08:55,911 --> 00:09:02,166
they had two scenes that they said
could not be in the movie

125
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,003
that were in that current script.

126
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:11,800
One was that they didn't want
to see Maggio, or Sinatra's character,

127
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,221
physically abused in the brig.

128
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:20,351
They didn't want to see any violence
of that nature on screen.

129
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,853
So that was eliminated.

130
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:29,151
The other one was the captain,
in the script,

131
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:34,865
was rewarded for his work
rather than punished.

132
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,078
And they said that would not fly
and they would not allow that.

133
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,582
Because in the original script,
he was promoted to major.

134
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,878
In this version,
you'll see that he's punished.

135
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:53,008
It's something they had to give in to in order
to make the picture at Schofield Barracks.

136
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,011
So they agreed to do that.

137
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,058
I'm a writer now,
and when I was given the script,

138
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,354
the following day after this phone call
and put on an aeroplane,

139
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,942
I was presented with Dan Taradash's script.

140
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,486
I had never read a movie script before.

141
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:19,451
It is a great film script,
a great adaptation.

142
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,870
It was like going to the movies.

143
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,374
It taught me everything
I needed to know about writing film.

144
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,753
I'll never forget when I read it,
how perfect it was.

145
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:36,844
I have a letter James Jones
wrote to my father

146
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,764
about his feelings of the script,

147
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,392
and I just wanted to read that here.

148
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:50,065
He wrote it on January 25th, 1953,
just before they went into production.

149
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,567
It said, "Dear Fred,

150
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,778
"I'm going to call you that,
since, after talking to Taradash,

151
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,822
"I always think of you that way.

152
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,200
"I want to tell you what a bang-up job
I think you two guys have done,

153
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:04,913
"along with Buddy, in getting
as much into the screenplay as you have.

154
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:09,418
"I had long expected and been resigned
to a typically sentimentalized,

155
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,005
"crapped-up movie version of the book.

156
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,467
"It was a hell of a surprise
to find it wasn't that."

157
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:22,848
So James Jones was a big fan
of the script of Taradash

158
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,601
and of the picture,

159
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:32,107
which, as a writer, you probably know
is not always the case, is it,

160
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,943
- with novelists, would you say?
- Absolutely.

161
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,406
But this particular one was extraordinary.

162
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,867
Then I went and read the book

163
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,037
and understood just what
he had been up against

164
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,122
and how successful it was.

165
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,293
I used the script once
when I was staying at a hotel.

166
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:58,217
Everybody stayed on Waikiki Beach
back then in 1953 or '52,

167
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,471
and of these wonderful hotels
that the stars stayed in,

168
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,225
we stayed inland
in some small place in town.

169
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:10,187
I remember there was a young waitress

170
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,525
who waited on us and wanted to write films.

171
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:20,489
So I showed her the script,
which brought me a lot of points with her.

172
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:26,161
It never went much further than that.
However, I don't remember so far back.

173
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,875
It was a successful script in many ways.

174
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:39,341
Going back to what Cohn said about
Aldo Ray being perfect for the part of Prewitt,

175
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:45,472
there's a description that I pulled out
of the script from Taradash's first draft

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,226
describing Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt

177
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:56,191
as a "23-year-old, deceptively slim,
immaculate, decisive.

178
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,027
"The picture of a soldier.

179
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,198
"On his sleeves are marks
where chevrons have been removed."

180
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:10,998
So the back-story of Prewitt was that
he was a corporal elsewhere,

181
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:15,252
and he had been busted to private,
because he wouldn't cooperate

182
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,882
and he had been reassigned
to Schofield Barracks.

183
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:28,891
So, actually, Clift was
very much properly cast,

184
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,019
I mean, the way he is described.

185
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,771
He was a dear man.

186
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:39,610
I remember the scene that
I did with him was done on the squad.

187
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,612
The sun was baking us.

188
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:47,743
We were really all very hot
and perspiring and weakened a bit.

189
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:54,750
I remember your father said,
"Al, would you like a glass of water?"

190
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,545
I'd never acted before in a movie,

191
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,759
and it was my first scene
that I ever had, one of two scenes.

192
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:08,430
I said,
"No, thank you. That's fine. I'm fine."

193
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,518
Monty Clift was standing next to me.

194
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,980
He knew I wanted some water and said,
"I'd like some water, Fred."

195
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,483
So out they brought him a glass of water.

196
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,736
He drank a few sips
and offered the rest of it to me.

197
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:29,743
There was a wonderful kindness in this man
that you could just perceive right away.

198
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:34,623
There was a gentleness
and a sadness and a caring.

199
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,625
A beautiful man.

200
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,836
He had an intensity and an intelligence,

201
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,591
and he really knew how to get
to the heart of a character.

202
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:49,805
I remember in pre-production, he knew
absolutely nothing about being a soldier.

203
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,599
He had no idea how to play a bugle.

204
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,979
He completely threw himself into the part,

205
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:01,817
and by the end, not only could
he play the bugle, it never left his side.

206
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:06,071
He used to sit up
in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel

207
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:10,951
and play the bugle to the kids
in the school next door,

208
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:16,456
because they used to come out
and go in by bugle calls.

209
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,919
So he would play the bugle call
at the wrong time,

210
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,297
and all the kids would
come out onto the field.

211
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,341
He used to have a great time
doing stuff like that.

212
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,262
What's interesting about the character
and the actor is that,

213
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:36,727
if you think about Monty Clift,
you just don't think of him as a bugler,

214
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,022
as playing the trumpet or any kind of horn.

215
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,691
And it made it even much more...

216
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,279
It must have been what your father saw in it,
the contrast of that character, that actor,

217
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,739
with what he had to be.

218
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,574
I'm sure that excited your father,

219
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,119
that edge that he always wanted
to give to everything.

220
00:15:55,872 --> 00:16:01,293
My father saw the character
as a loner who loved the Army

221
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,462
and was trying to fit in,

222
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,631
but was also a guy

223
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:11,887
who was self-destructive
in his stubbornness.

224
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:19,603
He tried to set this up
in the very beginning scene,

225
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:25,275
where you see a platoon marching by
and Clift coming towards camera,

226
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,362
and the platoon is moving across screen.

227
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,114
So they're moving in opposite directions,

228
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,204
and here is a lone soldier
coming towards camera and towards us.

229
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,582
But he's an outsider within the system.

230
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,380
That's a subject that has always fascinated
my father throughout his career,

231
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,760
which he repeated in other movies,
like Nun's Story, for instance.

232
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,513
What I knew of your father,

233
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,225
when I spent time with him
for a year or two on Julia,

234
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:06,441
this kind of wonderful stubbornness of his
that was really fierce sometimes.

235
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,405
You had to learn how not to be frightened
and how to stand up to him.

236
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,950
It always made things much better.

237
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:20,747
But he always did look for
that part of himself, I think,

238
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,583
that is in all of these characters.

239
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:30,298
I'd say, actually,
he himself was very much like Clift

240
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,218
in From Here to Eternity,

241
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,806
in that he did work
within the Hollywood system,

242
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,309
but he stubbornly would refuse,
in the beginning,

243
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:47,065
to do movies he didn't want to do,
even though he was under contract to MGM

244
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,318
and had no right to refuse to do them.

245
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,156
But he stuck to his guns.

246
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,618
In that way, he was very similar
to this character.

247
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,831
Precision, that's the big,
important word for your father.

248
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,376
He was so precise about everything,

249
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,756
and when he had a scene written,
at least in Julia,

250
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,385
it was finalised and there it was,
and that's what he shot.

251
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:25,187
It gave it kind of an eloquence and elegance
in everything that you saw on the screen.

252
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,439
It was very exciting.

253
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:33,528
When you think about From Here to Eternity,
the picture was made in 41 days.

254
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,697
They had a 42-day schedule.

255
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:42,913
So when you see what's on the screen,
they must have worked very quickly.

256
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:48,293
I read his script,
and he has notes on every page,

257
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:52,214
very precise notes about
where everybody is in a scene.

258
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,218
That's exactly what he did in the movie.

259
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:01,640
For him, the script was definitely the bible,
and he really adhered to it.

260
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:07,729
The scene we shot,
maybe there were three or four takes.

261
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,068
Then, later on, when the war begins,

262
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,199
there's a rumbling, I think, you hear.

263
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,328
The men are in their offices
and at the mess hall,

264
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,706
and you hear these bombs going off
in the distance.

265
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,168
Then suddenly you hear somebody
running across the field screaming,

266
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:34,422
"The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!"

267
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:39,094
I'll tell you how I got to do that,
which is kind of a funny idea in itself.

268
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:45,767
It was shot with
a Japanese Zero coming at us.

269
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,646
It was shot in half a day, as I remember,

270
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,942
whereas today,
that would have been a few days' work.

271
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,822
It was actually very effective
and the special effects were great.

272
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,367
There were a lot of bullets
in the ground in front of me,

273
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,411
and I had to stop at a certain spot.

274
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,747
Actually, there was another
person who had been given...

275
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,876
I had finished my little scene
with Monty Clift,

276
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,670
and I was standing around
with a bunch of people

277
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,589
watching somebody run
across the field screaming,

278
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:20,635
"The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!"

279
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,806
The actor did it with not very much intensity

280
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,560
and not really too worried about anything.

281
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,187
It just didn't work.

282
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,400
I remember everybody huddling

283
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,821
and deciding that actor wasn't going
to be able to pull this off.

284
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,656
I saw your father look around,

285
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:46,161
and I saw him wander towards this group
of guys in which I was standing.

286
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,832
I said to myself, "He's going to come
and he's going to ask me to do that.

287
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:55,378
"He's going to ask me to run across the field
and scream that the war is beginning."

288
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,423
I felt like a little kid playing war.

289
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,592
You know, it was really exciting.

290
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:07,015
He said, "Al, you think you could run across
the field and do that?"

291
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,601
I said, "Yeah, I think I could."

292
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,603
He said, "I think you can, too.

293
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:16,358
"Because, Al, look up there on that roof.

294
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,694
"See the man with the machine gun?"
I said, "Yeah."

295
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,614
He said, "Who's that?"
I said, "Burt Lancaster."

296
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:29,329
He said, "Yeah. Now, you, Al,
are a better actor than Burt Lancaster."

297
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,625
He laughed.

298
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:39,047
But he was trying to give me
some belief in myself.

299
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:44,844
So I ran across the field, screaming,
"The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!"

300
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,347
Announcing the war.

301
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,517
And very well done it was.

302
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:56,064
Then somebody thought I was a stuntman.
I wasn't. I just decided to flip over at the end.

303
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,816
Very believable.

304
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,487
One fellow, Bob Wilke, as a matter of fact,
came up and said,

305
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,741
"You know, that's really one
of the best stunts I've ever seen."

306
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,952
I'd go along with that.

307
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,329
For some reason,

308
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:15,291
I just recalled this story,
my father told me about Burt Lancaster.

309
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,962
They barely knew each other.

310
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:24,092
Burt had just been cast.
He was a big movie star.

311
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,054
It was the first day of rehearsal.

312
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,767
They were blocking a scene
with Monty Clift and Burt.

313
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:38,023
During the rehearsal,
Burt turned to Monty and said,

314
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,442
"Listen, Monty, instead
of coming from over here,

315
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,778
"why don't you go to the door
and come in that way?

316
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,907
"Let's see how that works."

317
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:55,123
They started doing it the way Burt
had directed Monty to play the scene.

318
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:00,295
And then my father waited till
halfway through the rehearsal and said,

319
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,672
"Stop. Let's stop here."

320
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:06,134
Burt was a little surprised
to be cut off in the middle of a scene,

321
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,720
especially since he was a big star.

322
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:13,641
My father just said quietly,
"Burt, could I talk to you for a moment?"

323
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:20,815
Burt said, "Sure."
So he says, "Let's walk outside."

324
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,152
So Burt and my father walked outside

325
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,238
and he said to Burt,

326
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:32,327
"Listen, I'm under the impression
that I was hired to direct this movie

327
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,662
"and that you were hired to act in it.

328
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,372
"If that's not your impression,

329
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:40,043
"then perhaps we should both go
see Harry Cohn right now."

330
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,883
Burt said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I'm just so enthusiastic about the project.

331
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,846
"I didn't mean to do that."

332
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:56,267
And that was the end of it.
From then on, they got along famously.

333
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,187
That must have been the day
he told me I was a better actor than...

334
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,855
Yeah, probably.

335
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,609
But my father's way of working...

336
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:09,114
They called him the Iron Fist
in the Velvet Glove.

337
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,908
He had a very...

338
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:17,205
In Julia, when we were about
to start shooting,

339
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,541
a month away,

340
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,711
Vanessa Redgrave came
into the room one day,

341
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,381
I was sitting there with them, and she said,

342
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:31,553
"Fred, I'd like to talk to you about
the script that I was given and agreed to do."

343
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,347
He said, "What's the problem, Vanessa?"

344
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,808
She said,

345
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:43,398
"There's a line here that was taken out
regarding Karl Marx."

346
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,319
He said, "Yes, we've taken
that out, Vanessa."

347
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,489
She said, "That's not the script
I agreed to do.

348
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:56,077
"I would like that name
to be back in that speech."

349
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,207
He said, "Well, that's not going
to be the way it is, Vanessa.

350
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:06,462
"I just don't think we want to talk about
Karl Marx at that moment."

351
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,174
She said, "Well, I don't know, Fred.

352
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:13,428
"Then I don't know if I can handle
the work as I intended to."

353
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:18,099
He said, "Then we can
always recast, you know."

354
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,146
And she said,
"Well, let me give it a think."

355
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:29,402
Of course, I'm shivering there,
thinking we're going to lose this actor.

356
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,448
She left the room
and he called Meryl Streep on the phone.

357
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,619
She came over the next day
or two days later.

358
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:41,039
They had a discussion in the room
about the part.

359
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:47,337
He had seen her in Shakespeare
in the Park in New York,

360
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,547
and she'd never been in a film before.

361
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:52,800
But he thought she would be
a very good Julia.

362
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,595
It worked out that Vanessa just went ahead

363
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,682
and had her wardrobe fittings
and everything was fine.

364
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,062
He put Meryl Streep into
a smaller role in the movie.

365
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,065
But, boy, he just stood up for it.

366
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,151
- Yes.
- He stood behind his guns, and that was that.

367
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:19,619
I thought I could talk also about
how Frank Sinatra got the part of Maggio.

368
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,333
It was not by putting a horse's head
in Harry Coho's bed,

369
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,670
as some people might have thought.

370
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,839
He, at that time,
was married to Ava Gardner,

371
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,176
who was doing a picture in Africa
called Mogambo.

372
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:41,307
Harry Cohn was over there visiting,
as it was a Columbia picture.

373
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:45,144
She said to Cohn,

374
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:49,190
"My husband, Frank,
would be perfect for Maggio.

375
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,484
"You should give him a shot."

376
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,861
At the time,

377
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:59,993
Sinatra was completely washed up
and really not working at all.

378
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,290
Cohn was very reluctant to do it,

379
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,585
but thought about it
and mentioned it to my father,

380
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,797
and then they decided to go ahead and test.

381
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,967
Cohn, who was very tight
with the bucks said,

382
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,470
"If you fly yourself over here,
we'll think about it,

383
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,639
"and you have to pay for your own test."

384
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:28,646
So Sinatra flew back from Africa,
paid for the test and did a brilliant job

385
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,149
and immediately got the part.

386
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:37,572
The only other person that had been
thought of for it was Eli Wallach,

387
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:43,494
who was also a very good actor,
but had a prior commitment with Kazan

388
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,540
to do a stage play, so he was out.

389
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:55,381
The closest I ever got to Frank Sinatra
was in a limousine

390
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,426
that picked him up and me at the same time.

391
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,678
For some reason,
I was sitting in the front with the driver,

392
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:04,640
and he was in the back with somebody,
I don't remember who it was.

393
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,685
All I know is they were speaking about Ava.

394
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,188
Maybe some problems with Ava,

395
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,399
I suspected,
because he was very nervous about Ava,

396
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,985
"Where is Ava?" and,
"Why don't I hear from Ava?"

397
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,072
It's the best I could pick up in the front,
that was it.

398
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,992
I think that was just
when they were splitting up,

399
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,870
and it might be that she wanted him
away from her at the time.

400
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,082
So she got him a role. Very good.

401
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,253
There you are, sweetie pie.
Dues all paid up.

402
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,256
Hey, who you got playing the piano there?
A hippo?

403
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,509
Oh, Angelo,
I don't think I've met your friend.

404
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,511
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

405
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,971
Oh, you know how I hate it
when you boys are in this condition.

406
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,556
You see that, buddy boy?

407
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,684
A woman sees a soldier,
and, like that, she figures he's drunk.

408
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,479
- Why? You know why?
- Because he is.

409
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,857
Well, heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
with the entertainment business.

410
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,485
Every respectable place
has to consider its future.

411
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:02,073
Mrs Kipfer, ma'am, you have my solemn
word your future will be safe with us!

412
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,158
Angelo is one of my favourites.

413
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:08,830
Annette, dear, take care of this
gentleman for me, will you, please?

414
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,499
That'll be four bucks, baby face.

415
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,710
Two for initiation fee,
two for this month's dues.

416
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,129
What do I get for it?

417
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,965
Members are entitled
to all privileges of the club,

418
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,426
which includes dancing,
snack bar, soft drink bar

419
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,928
and gentlemanly relaxation
with the opposite gender,

420
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,514
so long as they are gentlemen
and no liquor is permitted.

421
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:33,438
Donna Reed, in the novel,
was meant to be a prostitute.

422
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:38,276
Because of censorship at the time,
they changed it to a social club.

423
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,949
There was to be no hint
that this was a house of prostitution.

424
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,703
So they called it a social club.

425
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:54,959
Donna Reed was not particularly
my father's choice.

426
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,174
She was under contract to Columbia,

427
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:07,722
and my father felt that he had given
Cohn such a hard time about Clift

428
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:14,353
that he should really go along
with Coho's choice, Donna Reed.

429
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:18,399
He was very surprised to find

430
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:22,361
that she did the wonderful job
that she did do on the movie,

431
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:26,908
which, in the end,
gave her an Academy Award.

432
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:34,290
So he was extremely pleased
with what she did.

433
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:38,294
One of the other things is
that my father insisted

434
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,254
that the picture be shot
in black and white,

435
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,758
which was very much against
what the studio wanted,

436
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:48,012
because they thought that they would make
a couple million dollars more

437
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,764
if the picture was in colour.

438
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,183
He insisted on shooting in black and white,

439
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,312
because he thought it would give it
a much more realistic tone.

440
00:30:56,438 --> 00:31:00,775
So they did go along
with his desires on that.

441
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,278
Black and white made a big difference.

442
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,907
He shot so many of his films
in black and white, didn't he?

443
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:13,496
Yeah, I think, going back in time,
he was an apprentice to Robert Flaherty,

444
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,208
who was sort of the king of documentaries,

445
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,796
and he also started in photography.

446
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:30,471
So he was very influenced by documentaries
and by Flaherty.

447
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:37,603
That sort of continued on throughout his life
in all the work that he did.

448
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:42,400
I don't know
if you felt that influence in Julia.

449
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,779
No, I don't...

450
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,740
I mean, I think he basically
shot the script, didn't he?

451
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,577
He shot the script. It was wonderful.

452
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:59,125
I remember him saying
Sydney Pollack was meant to do it originally.

453
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,840
Sydney was involved in it
and then he pulled out.

454
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:14,599
Your father came over
looking for material at 20th Century Fox,

455
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:20,187
and that script was down there on some shelf
and they handed it to him.

456
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,276
And he read it and he said, "I want to do this.
I really would like to do this film."

457
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,571
I don't think he made
any changes at all, did he?

458
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,700
We made very few changes in England.

459
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,914
We worked on that precision, you know.

460
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,877
I remember it was May. We were going
to start shooting in September.

461
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:47,506
I think it was May,
and he said, "You know, Al..."

462
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,884
I said, "I think we're ready.
We've got the script."

463
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:54,138
And he said, "Yes, but I want
this cross to the window,

464
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:58,142
"and I don't think we have it yet."
I said, "Well, I'll get it."

465
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:03,981
He said, "No, it's a cross to the window.
I want it more precise than it is now."

466
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:09,236
"What do you mean, like going around
a chair, or picking up a teapot or what?"

467
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,031
He said,
"Just..." I said, "We'll get it, I..."

468
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,451
He said,
"Well, Al..." I said, "Well, it's May."

469
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:21,290
He said, "The clock is ticking,"
which I'm sure you've heard many times.

470
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:25,002
Did he ever connect you back
to From Here to Eternity?

471
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:30,633
We had lunch one day
with him and his friend.

472
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:38,182
And I said, "Do you remember
From Here to Eternity?"

473
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,477
And I mentioned the scene,
and I said, "That's me, Fred."

474
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,938
I remember. And he was pleased.

475
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,233
The next day, he gave me
a photograph of himself

476
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,695
and Burt Lancaster and Monty Clift.

477
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:54,240
They signed it. I still have it on my wall.

478
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:01,831
I noticed the scene that's coming up here
was highly controversial at the time.

479
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:11,549
And I think, was it the Breen Office,
it was the censorship of the day,

480
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:19,640
insisted that Deborah Kerr
wear a skirt over her bathing suit.

481
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:25,563
They were insistent that
they not touch in a certain way.

482
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,484
It's still one of the most
romantic scenes in film.

483
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:35,698
I think what they found erotic
and objectionable was the water

484
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,074
in that particular scene.

485
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,451
Rolling up over them.

486
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,036
They wanted some cuts made.

487
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,625
There were certain angles that
my father was not allowed to shoot

488
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,170
because of censorship at the time.

489
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:55,176
It's a scene that caused a big flap
in its day, as I remember.

490
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:01,557
Must have been phone calls every day
from Hollywood to Honolulu,

491
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,810
with your father ignoring most of them.

492
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,438
Ignoring everything he could.

493
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,525
But sometimes there was too much pressure
and he had to give in.

494
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,071
Let's go up to Mrs Kipfer's parlour
and sit there.

495
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,202
- She was really wonderful.
- Donna Reed was great.

496
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:27,875
I think up to this time, she'd done
mainly roles of starlets and stuff.

497
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:33,297
- Was she on television already or...
- I don't think so.

498
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,717
I think she was just
a contract player at Columbia.

499
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:44,767
The water, this part is what the Breen Office,
they objected to this.

500
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,686
The water rushing in.

501
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,481
- Oh, boy.
- But it stayed in.

502
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,858
And then running after her.

503
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:58,405
And then for years, this was one of the most
famous love scenes ever shot, I think.

504
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,411
They're so mature, these two people.
It made it so much more exciting

505
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,748
that they weren't just young kids.

506
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:13,003
There's an elegance about the way it's shot.
It's the utter precision, too.

507
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,051
Black and white does so much
for you, though. Doesn't it?

508
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,513
- If he did that in colour, wouldn't you lose...
- A lot.

509
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:28,352
Because it makes it very specific
and you're focused in on these two.

510
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,438
- How many men do you think there've been?
- I wouldn't know.

511
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,440
Can't you give me a rough estimate?

512
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:39,446
I saw your father when he was here last time.
What's that? 15 years ago?

513
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,366
- No, when was he here last?
- '92.

514
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:47,705
'92, yeah. We had lunch together.
It was a nice time.

515
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:53,294
Yeah, he died in '97, so it's the last trip
he made to Los Angeles.

516
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,839
The year before he died,
I was in London with my granddaughter.

517
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,257
I took her for a trip.

518
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,634
We went and tried to find his...

519
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,720
We went over to...

520
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,014
- What's the street he was on?
- Mount Street.

521
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:09,059
Mount Street. But nobody was there.

522
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,270
- 98 Mount Street?
- 98, yeah.

523
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,606
He was there,
but probably wasn't answering.

524
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,190
I think that's right.

525
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,610
Yeah. Because he became very deaf.

526
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,404
That's too bad.

527
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,406
Which he was able to use as a weapon,

528
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,409
because he basically heard
anything he wanted to hear.

529
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,996
But he would pretend that
he hadn't heard anything.

530
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,206
I should have sent him a note.

531
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:39,256
During Julia,
I had the apartment next door,

532
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:45,012
up above the chicken store.
I think there was a bakery or a butcher.

533
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,600
We had two scripts.

534
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:57,107
We had the red script, which was my script,
and there was your father's script,

535
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,402
which had certain changes in it
that we fought.

536
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:05,491
We used to have a big sign up
on the wall in our office,

537
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,535
and it said, "Better red than Fred."

538
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:16,251
We had a good time, though.
I learned a lot from your father.

539
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:23,300
I'd only been married to Dana two years
when I found out he was cheating.

540
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:27,012
This looks like it was shot late in the day.

541
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,390
I thought I had something to hope for.

542
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,726
I was almost happy
the night the pains began.

543
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,313
I think this scene still holds up
after all these years.

544
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,482
It's very sensual, don't you think?

545
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,069
She's a knockout.

546
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,197
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

547
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,865
He was great.

548
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,245
Did he win an Oscar,
or did she win an Oscar?

549
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,582
No, they were both nominated.
Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra did.

550
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:02,214
I think the picture was nominated
for 13 and won eight Academy Awards.

551
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:09,221
My father did win and Taradash won,
and the picture won and editing.

552
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,683
But in the way this is shot,

553
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:18,981
this very much goes back to his beginning
and his influences with Flaherty.

554
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,482
It's very precise.

555
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:25,362
He also worked with a great man,
Paul Strand, who was a still photographer.

556
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,865
He was also a cinematographer.

557
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,035
There's a real elegance

558
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,582
to how he composed his shots
and a real precision to it.

559
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,418
Did your father make some documentaries?

560
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:43,047
He made one and he actually won
an Academy Award for it.

561
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:47,342
It was for orthopaedic hospitals.
It was a charity thing.

562
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:54,516
But no, he wanted to, and he was dying
to work with Flaherty,

563
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:59,063
but he wound up spending six months
in Berlin drinking beer with Flaherty

564
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:04,109
and not making anything.
But he did learn a lot from him.

565
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,032
Look at her. Look at that arm.

566
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,829
In my father's direction,
everything is thought out.

567
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,832
It was always very precise.

568
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:23,962
Nothing was ever left to chance,
in terms of the framing, the staging.

569
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,928
He was a big believer in preparation.
He never did wing it.

570
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,888
Tell me about it.

571
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:38,435
But there was a security in that, too,
when you worked with him.

572
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,691
You wrote, and you placed something
on a page and it was agreed on.

573
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:49,446
And you felt that what
you were going to do next,

574
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:54,910
whatever you were going to do,
was going to be given some credibility.

575
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:59,039
You weren't going to have to worry about it
being tampered with all the time.

576
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,374
Right.

577
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:06,338
There's a scene that's going
to be coming up later with Sinatra,

578
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,299
where he is arrested and is resisting arrest.

579
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:13,387
I think it was the last night of shooting.

580
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:19,726
Harry Cohn had come over
and was not coming on the set,

581
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,397
but was getting reports back as
to how everything was going.

582
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,899
There weren't really any problems.

583
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:31,280
They were delighted with dailies
and everything was going really well.

584
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,828
But there was some concern about the scene
that my father had staged that afternoon

585
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:44,418
that they were going to shoot at night, where
Maggio is standing up, resisting arrest.

586
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:49,923
The Army complained to Cohn
and said they didn't want him to resist.

587
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,467
They just wanted him to be arrested.

588
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,637
That night, while they were
shooting the scene,

589
00:41:55,722 --> 00:42:00,893
Cohn came on the set
with the commandant of the base

590
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,979
to watch the shooting.

591
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:10,110
They started to shoot
as they had staged the scene.

592
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:16,491
Cohn went to my father and said, "Maggio
has to sit down, not stand up in the scene."

593
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,120
Contrary to my father's character

594
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,873
and contrary to everything
he had done before,

595
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,875
he said, "Yes, okay."

596
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:31,089
I think this caused a rift
with Sinatra and my father

597
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,218
that never healed, really.

598
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:42,017
But my father, according to him, did this
because the Army insisted on it,

599
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:46,605
and he felt that he had pushed it to the wall,

600
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,525
and he wasn't going to get them to bend,

601
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:56,698
so he just gave up on that point
and had Maggio sit down in the scene,

602
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,953
which, apparently,
Sinatra was very upset about.

603
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,790
...and he must have been set
pretty flat on his feet...

604
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:09,962
I liked him sitting down. It's fine.
Maybe your father knew that, too.

605
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:14,925
Maybe he thought, "That's not a bad idea.
I'll act as if I'm giving him something."

606
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,220
I think in Sinatra's mind,

607
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:25,227
he lost respect for my father
for not standing up for himself.

608
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,864
You said that Clift was
a good friend of your family's?

609
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:42,577
- You spent a lot of time with him socially?
- Well, we went back...

610
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,123
Clift did, I think, his first picture,

611
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,584
I can't remember if it was before Red River
or right after,

612
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,796
but he got the lead in
a picture called The Search

613
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,551
that my father did in Germany
right after World War II,

614
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,471
and did it very much as a documentary.

615
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:09,229
And Clift became a very close family friend,

616
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,149
including a friend to me.

617
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:15,235
He used to come
and play with me all the time.

618
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:18,822
He had his agent send me birthday presents.

619
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,449
His agent was Lew Wasserman,

620
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,953
so he'd send Lew Wasserman out
to buy me a birthday gift.

621
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:31,626
- How old were you now?
- When we first met Clift, I was seven or six.

622
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,922
During the making of From Here to Eternity,
I was 13.

623
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:44,097
But Clift, until his death,
was a close family friend to all of us.

624
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,108
I remember taking little walks around
that beach with your mother.

625
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,693
- Really?
- Yeah.

626
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,320
I don't know why.

627
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:02,407
I found myself once walking with Fred's wife.

628
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,326
Really? That's funny.

629
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,120
All right, that's enough.

630
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:23,095
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

631
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,941
Clift looks in great shape there.
He does look like a middleweight.

632
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,026
Yeah, absolutely.

633
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,366
I used to go and watch him
with Mushy Callahan.

634
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:49,913
I used to go and watch them training.
It was kind of fun.

635
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,250
So much my pockets is sore

636
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,794
Oh, my pockets is sore

637
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,838
Yeah, that a boy!

638
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,841
More dough than I can use

639
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:04,094
Reenlistment blues

640
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,429
Sing it, boys!

641
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,404
Time!

642
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:40,213
My father, being very precise in his thinking,

643
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,300
in the way that he shoots
and the way that he prepares,

644
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,389
contrary to that,
he was also a great risk-taker,

645
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,517
as Alvin was talking about with Vanessa.

646
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:59,649
And possibly throwing the best person
for the part out of the movie

647
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:04,404
just because she resisted some changes.

648
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:11,036
Anyway, my father,
right after From Here to Eternity,

649
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,915
was riding high, extremely successful.

650
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,002
He went out and did something
that he'd never done before,

651
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,462
which is, bought a new car.

652
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:27,385
It was this fancy Jaguar that he picked up
in Italy for some reason.

653
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,765
He said to me, "Let's go for a ride."

654
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:36,394
We were in Rome
and he loved to drive really fast.

655
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,688
He was actually a reckless driver.

656
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,440
We were approaching Switzerland

657
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:45,362
at about 100 miles an hour
in this fancy Mark VII Jaguar.

658
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,699
There was a gypsy caravan going
into a tunnel ahead of us,

659
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,452
and there were two choices,

660
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,082
either slow down and go through the tunnel
behind the horse-drawn caravan,

661
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,460
or try to pass them in the tunnel.

662
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:06,132
The car was very big
and the caravan overhung the road.

663
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:10,971
It didn't look like we were all going to fit.
But he decided to gun it.

664
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:16,393
So he passed the caravan
on the wrong side of the road in the tunnel

665
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,856
with sparks coming off the driver's side,

666
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:26,069
because he kept hitting the tunnel wall
all the way through.

667
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:29,906
And sparks were flying off his side,

668
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:35,328
and we just kept on going straight through
the tunnel and got to the other side.

669
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,834
He had been, with me,
very precise getting into the car,

670
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:45,422
not to put my fingerprints on the glass,
and not to touch the seat

671
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,883
and not to touch the wood
and all of these things,

672
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,053
and to be very careful
because it was brand new.

673
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:56,266
Now, essentially, the whole left side
of the car had been sheared off.

674
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,520
He completely played it
like nothing had happened.

675
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:06,318
We got out of the tunnel, past the caravan.
We were still going 100 miles an hour.

676
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:10,030
I think we stopped
someplace in Italy for lunch.

677
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,533
We just pulled to a stop and he said,

678
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,202
"Excuse me, but I think
I'd better get out your side.

679
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,039
"There's something wrong with my door."

680
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:25,545
That's very much how my father was,

681
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,465
not only in life, but in his work.

682
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:34,346
There was definitely this dichotomy
where he was extremely precise,

683
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:41,144
but he was also willing to throw it
all away at any time for a principle.

684
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,688
And a good story.

685
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,612
Well, good for him. I'll buy that.

686
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,699
I would have taken a long time
and been behind that cart.

687
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:06,670
So he was always one to take chances
in his personal life and in his work.

688
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,756
He would always...

689
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:18,098
In terms of From Here to Eternity,
he would much rather go with Deborah Kerr,

690
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,308
who was not the popular choice,

691
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,811
who was not somebody
you'd think of for the role,

692
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:28,483
as against a proven star like Joan Crawford,
who not only was up for it,

693
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,860
but thought she had the role

694
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,447
and was even talking to the costume
designer about her wardrobe.

695
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,534
I wouldn't have wanted
to be in her house that night

696
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,620
- when she learned the truth.
- No.

697
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,837
In all of these scenes,
just look at this scene, particularly,

698
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:53,550
I mean, there's always a story being told.

699
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,971
Every moment there's a story.

700
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:05,145
The cleanliness of the scene,
the sharpness of the images

701
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,565
is so much your father.

702
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:13,111
I remember he considered John Ford
a mentor, in a way,

703
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,488
and he very much admired his work.

704
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,743
Ford said to him about his earlier work,
he said,

705
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:24,581
"You know, kid, you've got potential,
but you move the camera too much.

706
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,835
"Just remember the camera
is an information booth

707
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,254
"and let the people come to you."

708
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,090
I think that's something
that stuck with my father, too.

709
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:38,094
I've watched him
and what I found was that he...

710
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,514
And then I started doing it in writing, too.

711
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:47,729
He doesn't move in on faces.

712
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:55,528
He cuts closer and cuts closer,
but there's never that zooming in.

713
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,742
Because I don't think
that's how stories are told, anyway.

714
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:07,332
You always tell a story... A story's like a...

715
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:15,799
A movie's like a joke. Like you tell a joke,
that's how you tell a movie, a story.

716
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:21,721
So this happened, two guys came into a bar.
They stood in front of the bartender.

717
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:26,559
An elephant walked in the door.
You know, it's all very quick, very precise.

718
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,980
Dreams are also, I think, very much...

719
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:35,819
I write when I think about cutting,
moving a story along,

720
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:40,073
I think about, "Does it work in a dream?
Does it work in a joke?"

721
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,243
When you tell a tale... And your father...

722
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:48,081
I don't know if this applies
to what I'm talking about with your father,

723
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:51,709
but if you watch, you don't see
a lot of camera movement.

724
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:56,422
You don't see a lot of... God.
Zooming in and out.

725
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,216
Panning, very little panning.

726
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,095
No, he was a very good editor

727
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:07,267
and relied on good editors,
such as Walter Murch

728
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:12,605
and a lot of people that he worked with
to really let them do their job.

729
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:21,698
- Murch was very helpful on Julia.
- I'm sure he was.

730
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,534
But he definitely listened to the editors,

731
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,120
and he gave them the respect
that they're due.

732
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,416
Editing was very important to him.

733
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,251
He was an editor, wasn't he?

734
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,838
He began as an assistant
cameraman in Berlin.

735
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:41,217
He worked with Billy Wilder
on his first movie.

736
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:46,139
He came to Hollywood,
hoping to break in as a cameraman.

737
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:51,728
His first job was as an extra as a German
lieutenant on All Quiet on the Western Front.

738
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,313
Really?

739
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:58,860
He was told by the first assistant director
to do something and he said no.

740
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:02,113
He got fired, which is typical of him.

741
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,073
Glad he was acting.

742
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,916
But in terms of his camera set-ups,

743
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:20,006
he's always doing it being terribly aware
of how he's going to edit the picture.

744
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,928
He also started in the shorts department,

745
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:30,350
so he learned how to tell a story,
say of George Washington,

746
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,771
80 years of George Washington
Carver's life in 10 minutes.

747
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:40,652
So there was always this economy
to his style.

748
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,741
He always knew
where he was going to go with the material.

749
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,495
Also, in these days, in the '50s,

750
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:57,126
people like Harry Cohn
did interfere with editing a lot,

751
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:02,215
the process, and they did have final cut
and the directors didn't.

752
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,635
In the case of From Here to Eternity,

753
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:10,181
I think they shot it in the spring of '53,

754
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:15,687
and they had it edited by June

755
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,188
and in the theatres by August.

756
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,941
So it's a very fast schedule.

757
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:27,573
They didn't give my father much time
to edit the movie.

758
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:31,577
Cohn came right in and took it over
and made his changes,

759
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:36,249
and my father had to fight tooth and nail
for what he believed in with Cohn.

760
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:43,965
The picture was released in August
in the biggest theatre on Broadway,

761
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,635
which was not air-conditioned.

762
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:53,474
It was regarded as
a very foolish move by many,

763
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,352
but Cohn took full responsibility for it.

764
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:59,689
They didn't do a press preview
for the picture.

765
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,607
They just released it.

766
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,736
On the first night at midnight,

767
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:09,032
Marlene Dietrich called my father,
who he didn't know that well,

768
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:15,121
and said there's lines around the block
and they've added a 1:00 show.

769
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,499
Then everybody knew
it was going to be a big hit.

770
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,043
Great.

771
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,714
They opened it here at the Pantages Theater.

772
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:28,843
I went back after my week or so
on this movie.

773
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:34,140
I went back to selling advertising
at Daily Variety.

774
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:39,771
They opened the movie five months later,
whenever it was, six months later,

775
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:46,194
and I went to the premiere by myself, I think.

776
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:53,534
And sat there, somehow I got in
and watched this movie.

777
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:59,916
Suddenly there I was,
this amazing full close-up

778
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,461
on the Pantages movie house screen.

779
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,839
It must have been a thrill.

780
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,510
I didn't know if it was a thrill
or embarrassing, I couldn't tell.

781
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,262
It's like listening to your own voice.

782
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,682
That scene will be coming up
here in a minute.

783
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:23,356
But there was definitely a feeling
about this movie in pre-production

784
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,900
that it was a great script and a great project.

785
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,986
I remember the opening night,
the premiere there.

786
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,948
It was a thrilling night.

787
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:36,994
Everybody just couldn't get over it.

788
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,164
My own personal recollection,

789
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:44,127
I had just been for the summer
touring Europe

790
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,546
with some people from my school

791
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,590
and met my father in New York
just as the picture...

792
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:53,803
I think it was in its first week,
I forget the theatre, on Broadway.

793
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:58,891
He said to me, "Do you want to go see
my latest picture, From Here to Eternity?"

794
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,270
And I said, "Sure, I'd be thrilled."

795
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:08,067
It was the first time he'd allowed me to see
one of his pictures, other than High Noon.

796
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,405
So we went to the theatre.

797
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:17,952
It was a really hot day, and we got close
and there was this huge long line

798
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,329
that went all the way around the block.

799
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,748
We got right up to the front door.

800
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,794
He talked to somebody there
and they let us right in.

801
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:30,381
I was completely impressed.

802
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,926
The long line was for the next show.

803
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:38,556
There was a show in progress,
so they were in line waiting for two hours.

804
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,143
We went in and sat down.

805
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:46,397
It was a theatre that held 2,000 people.
It was a big deal.

806
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,860
That was the first moment
that I knew my father had made it.

807
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,113
Because prior to that,
he was an art-house director,

808
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:59,118
and we lived in a small house
and drove an old car.

809
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,287
This was his big moment.

810
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:06,417
Great. He shared it. Beautiful.
Big moment in your life.

811
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,296
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.

812
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,139
- There's Bob Wilke.
- There's Bob Wilke.

813
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,308
Maggio, get ready for guard.

814
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,101
Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.

815
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,437
He was also in High Noon, actually.

816
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,856
- Was he one of the three guys?
- Yeah.

817
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,150
Not any more. Anderson's sick.
You're on guard.

818
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,568
I just had guard yesterday.

819
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,445
That was a great film.

820
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,156
You should've gotten dressed faster.

821
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,750
I sure never figured
in your giving me the runaround.

822
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,795
- They didn't even want to let me in this place.
- We're mobbed, that's why.

823
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,632
Talking about editing,

824
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,429
the way things worked in 1953,

825
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:04,433
Harry Cohn had the final cut.

826
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:11,399
A lot of the things that the directors
of those days did in self-defence

827
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:16,195
was what they used to call camera-cutting,

828
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:23,244
and not give what they called "the
front office" enough coverage to work with,

829
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:27,373
so that a scene could only be cut in one way.

830
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,459
And this was a trick
my father learned early on

831
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:36,716
and utilised in most of his movies up to
this point, including From Here to Eternity.

832
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:42,638
So I think a lot of that
was why he was so precise.

833
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:49,729
It was just a way to protect himself
and protect his vision of the movie.

834
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,901
As I think I said before, the picture

835
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:03,117
was made quite quickly, in today's terms.

836
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,411
So it was made in eight weeks.

837
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:12,418
The cutting period was only about
two months before they went to a preview.

838
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:19,925
I think that they found in the first preview
that they were going to have a monstrous hit,

839
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:24,680
because they utilised something
that was new for the time.

840
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:31,228
They wired every seat in the preview theatre,

841
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:35,608
and they were able to get
the response of everybody

842
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,527
to each particular scene
at any given moment.

843
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,947
And apparently, Harry Cohn

844
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:46,035
came out with a 25-foot-long roll of paper

845
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:51,791
with a graph that showed everybody's
reaction to everything in the picture,

846
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:56,796
and came screaming down the aisles
and saying, "We have a hit! We have a hit!"

847
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,715
And I don't believe
they ever previewed the picture again.

848
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,052
And they just decided to release it in August.

849
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,639
So from inception to release,

850
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:12,561
it was less than a year,
which was very fast.

851
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,732
See, I'm just lucky getting in town.

852
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:20,111
- Topkick gave me a break.
- They still pouring it on?

853
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,988
Holmes and those others,
they really got me on the edge.

854
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,575
- Gee, you must hate the army.
- No, I don't hate the army.

855
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,577
But look what it's doing to you.

856
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,746
I love the army.

857
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,083
But it sure doesn't love you.

858
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,586
A man loves a thing,
that don't mean it's gotta love him back.

859
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:43,926
I was just wondering
when you were at home and Clift was around,

860
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,095
were you making the movie then?

861
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,179
Did he...

862
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,682
- What, From Here to Eternity?
- Yeah.

863
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,766
Well, he...

864
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:53,102
Was there any discussion about...

865
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:57,690
What I'm getting at is,
was there much discussion about the film,

866
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,818
or was your father always away
when he was shooting this?

867
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:06,115
They were away, and they worked
intensely and closely together.

868
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,202
My experience with Clift

869
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,123
was after he came back
and he was still in character.

870
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:19,462
And he was still wandering around
in Hawaiian shirts and clutching his bugle.

871
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,799
I remember going to
Don The Beachcomber's,

872
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:28,387
which was a very chic place at the time
to go for dinner.

873
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:35,811
He got extremely obnoxious
and very rude and very drunk.

874
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,646
And he had his bugle,

875
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:43,486
which he was blowing in the middle
of dinner and getting everybody very upset.

876
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,949
This is working on the role, right?

877
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:53,496
Well, no, this was after he had finished
and he couldn't get out of the role.

878
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,667
And somebody came up to the table
and said,

879
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,462
"Listen, you're upsetting my wife,
and you're upsetting me.

880
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:05,925
"And we're trying to have a peaceful dinner.
Just, will you cut it out?"

881
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,181
And Clift told him where to go and stood up,

882
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:17,853
and then the guy decked him
and knocked him out completely,

883
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:22,358
and he was on the floor with blood
gushing out of his nose, clutching his bugle.

884
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:27,696
And then the matre d' came over and
thought it would be a good idea if we left.

885
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,785
This isn't that kind, gentle fellow
I was talking about earlier.

886
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,203
- Who, Clift?
- Clift.

887
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,914
He had his moments both ways, I'd say.

888
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,710
You get your tail right back to the post.
You're in trouble. You know that.

889
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:46,048
So many of these people are...

890
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,051
I don't want to talk about that,
but passed away.

891
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,054
So few people are left.

892
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,974
- That's amazing how few there are.
- Yeah.

893
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,643
You'd better go.

894
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:03,691
What's interesting to me is how this movie,
watching it, still holds up.

895
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:13,492
I don't know what to attribute it to other than
good acting, good script, good direction.

896
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:17,580
But it's something that's
really stood the test of time, I think.

897
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,582
Yeah, you're awake.
Put your clothes on, all right?

898
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,334
Give them back to the Indians.
The Indians need the clothes.

899
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:26,922
Look at the structure of that shot.

900
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:36,056
He staged everything so beautifully.

901
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:42,980
I think part of the reason that they were able
to do movies in eight weeks then

902
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,108
was that they were so precise
about what they were doing,

903
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,694
and things were so well thought out.

904
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:52,573
They didn't really use multiple cameras.

905
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,912
Things were just a lot easier.

906
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,916
Well, I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

907
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,209
I ain't no coward!

908
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,463
- Is this the scene where he gets arrested?
- Yeah.

909
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:10,424
You get dressed, you put your clothes on.

910
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,969
- Will you wait for me? I'll get a cab.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

911
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,680
- Will you wait?
- Yeah, you get a cab.

912
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:22,645
- How much of it was shot in Hawaii?
- The whole movie.

913
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:23,729
- Was it all shot there?
- Yeah.

914
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,939
- Nothing back here at all?
- Nothing.

915
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:33,238
I think this is the scene coming up
that was the one I was talking about earlier.

916
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,199
Come and get me, you guys!

917
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,284
Here I am!

918
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:45,000
Is that the best you can do?
I bet you guys eat Wheaties!

919
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:57,846
Harry Bellaver, he was in Naked City.
I used to write Naked City's...

920
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:58,889
Television.

921
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,100
- Which one is he?
- He's sitting on the desk in the...

922
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,022
He's one of the three cops in Naked City.

923
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:15,698
So many of these actors
have had such careers that...

924
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,282
There's Jack Warden.

925
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,453
He was also another one up for the captain.

926
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,288
- Jack Warden was?
- Yeah.

927
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:30,921
Go on and shoot some pool.
Any word comes through, I'll let you know.

928
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:36,468
Don Dubbins, over there on the left.

929
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,848
He'd just gotten married, I think, when...

930
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,145
See, going back to what I was saying earlier

931
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:50,899
about my father's
being influenced by documentaries,

932
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:55,571
you can see how he used practical locations.

933
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,742
He used very few sets.

934
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:04,413
And this is something
that's commonplace now, but in those days,

935
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,374
it was rarely done.

936
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,837
It's another thing he utilised,
practical locations.

937
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,007
It was very important to him
to get a real look.

938
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,686
There was, I think, about another 20 minutes
in the original script

939
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:33,275
where Sinatra is beat up in jail.

940
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,697
And that was one of the cuts
that the Army insisted upon.

941
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,328
And Taradash and my father
gladly agreed to it,

942
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,456
because they thought
the movie was too long, anyway.

943
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:53,921
So all you saw there was him pick up the
baton, and that's all you really need to see.

944
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,381
And I tell about it, in a minute.

945
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,843
You can use it any time you want to,
even when I'm not here.

946
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

947
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,732
This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.

948
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:19,404
It's a simple character,
simple girl, pretty girl.

949
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:22,699
I think it's interesting
how they made this work.

950
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:28,580
Even though she's supposed to be
a prostitute, they managed to make...

951
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,666
- But it still worked, didn't it?
- It still somehow worked.

952
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,837
- It was right on the cusp, almost.
- Yeah.

953
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:39,508
And there's not a lot of set dressing,
you notice, on all of his shots.

954
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,846
It's the people
that seem to be more important than...

955
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,431
In terms of... What do you mean?

956
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:49,977
In all the scenes,
there's something very clean about...

957
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:55,023
His framing
is very precise and well thought out.

958
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,454
You okay?

959
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,835
Perfect couple.

960
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:27,139
The cameraman won an Academy Award
for this movie, too.

961
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,390
Burnie Guffey.

962
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,101
- Lighting is so great, isn't it?
- Yeah.

963
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,604
Look at that.

964
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:05,177
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

965
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:10,140
So interesting, Ernie Borgnine

966
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:15,771
going from Marty, the sweet butcher boy,

967
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,858
to the totally bad...

968
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,110
To Fatso.

969
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,529
I think he was a marvellous villain.

970
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,073
He was great.

971
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:36,959
I remember they used to shoot day for night
a lot, which they don't do any more.

972
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,090
It can't go on like this much longer.

973
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,971
Film was so much slower,
and the lenses were so much slower then.

974
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,222
I know.

975
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,566
- Smoking does add something, doesn't it?
- Yes.

976
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:04,236
...but he'd never let me
transfer out of his outfit.

977
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,198
There is a way.

978
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,412
I've been thinking about it.
You've got to become an officer.

979
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:17,666
You can take the new extension course,
the one they passed last May.

980
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,835
When you get your commission,
they'd ship you back to the States.

981
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,837
An officer?

982
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:25,841
Yes. Then I could divorce Dana
and marry you.

983
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,552
I hate officers!
I've always hated officers!

984
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:34,516
- How old were they?
- In their 30s.

985
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,602
Mid-30s?

986
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:41,314
I'd say that.
And Clift would have been about the same.

987
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,152
Okay, suppose I did it.
And don't think it's a cinch.

988
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:52,701
My father had been working
for already about 20 years,

989
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:59,041
so I'd say this was the pinnacle of his career
to this point.

990
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:06,631
And it definitely put him in the front ranks
after its release.

991
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,468
So this was a major film for his career.

992
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:16,558
I've never been so miserable in my life
as I have since I met you.

993
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,061
Neither have I.

994
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,480
I wouldn't trade a minute of it.

995
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,023
Neither would I.

996
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,987
I'll probably make the lousiest officer
in this man's army you ever saw.

997
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:32,157
You'll make a fine officer.

998
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,327
A remarkable officer.

999
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,501
Thank you.

1000
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,255
Come here.

1001
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,010
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

1002
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,599
- Honey?
- What?

1003
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,476
I want to marry you.

1004
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,522
You're a funny one.

1005
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,441
Why? Why is it funny
if a guy wants to marry you?

1006
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,113
Because I'm a girl you met
at the New Congress Club.

1007
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,615
That's about two steps up
from the pavement.

1008
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,786
Well, what am I?
I'm a private no-class dogface.

1009
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,206
The way most civilians look at that,
that's two steps up from nothing.

1010
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,669
Prew, I thought we were happy.

1011
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,671
Why do you want to spoil things?

1012
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,882
Look,
I've got a year to go before I reenlist.

1013
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:35,929
If I can swing sergeant's stripes by then,
they'll let me go back to the States.

1014
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,974
Then you and I can
go back there together, if you'll wait.

1015
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:42,394
How do you expect to become a sergeant
under that Captain Holmes of yours?

1016
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,396
It's all you can do
to keep out of the stockade.

1017
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,568
I'll fight.

1018
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,320
- No, you're not gonna fight.
- It'd be worth it.

1019
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,121
Prew, it's true we love each other now,

1020
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,456
we need each other,

1021
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,294
but back in the States,
it might be different.

1022
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,297
That ain't the real reason.

1023
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,094
- All right, it's not.
- What is the real reason?

1024
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:23,268
I won't marry you, because I don't want
to be the wife of a soldier.

1025
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,943
Well, that would be about
the best I could ever do for you.

1026
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,659
Because nobody's gonna
stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.

1027
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,703
Because I want to be proper.

1028
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,581
- Proper?
- Yes, proper.

1029
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,418
In another year, I'll have
enough money saved,

1030
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,629
and then I'm gonna go back
to my hometown in Oregon,

1031
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,548
and I'm gonna build a house
for my mother and myself,

1032
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:56,343
and join the country club and take up golf.

1033
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,597
And I'll meet the proper man
with the proper position,

1034
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:06,144
and make a proper wife who can run
a proper home and raise proper children.

1035
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:10,732
And I'll be happy
because when you're proper, you're safe.

1036
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,945
You got guts, honey.

1037
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,989
I hope you can pull it off.

1038
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,667
I do mean it when I say I need you,

1039
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,919
'cause I'm lonely.

1040
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,047
You think I'm lying, don't you?

1041
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,677
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

1042
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,688
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

1043
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:54,192
Why? Because the scandal would spoil
your chances for a promotion?

1044
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,694
I ask you once more.

1045
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,570
I want to know who he is
and where you met him.

1046
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,197
I'm not going to tell you.

1047
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:05,996
One thing I know. I know he's a civilian.
You'd be too discreet to pick an army man.

1048
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,374
I wonder which is hurt more,
your pride or your curiosity?

1049
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,543
You can't expect to know how
I feel about a thing like this.

1050
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,379
I wonder why men feel
so differently about it than women.

1051
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,007
It's just not the same.

1052
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,889
It's a lovely day.
I think I'll go for a walk.

1053
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,476
Here I am.

1054
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,314
There you are.

1055
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,773
You look just the same.

1056
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:36,026
- Hardly.
- I know.

1057
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:38,611
I kept my mouth shut,
and I didn't get in no trouble.

1058
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,155
Did you see Maggio?

1059
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:44,242
I wasn't even considered to be an actor
in my own mind.

1060
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,577
Yeah.

1061
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,580
You're holding your own against Clift there.

1062
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,915
He's got it down to a system.

1063
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,584
He kicks him a lot, too.

1064
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,920
You know how Maggio's taking it?

1065
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:59,883
He just keeps spittin' in Fatso's eye.

1066
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,926
Ain't he a hot one?

1067
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,846
He's a good man.

1068
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,933
Was he helpful as an actor to you?

1069
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:15,357
He was the connection.

1070
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:19,944
The character was so clear.
He looked right at you.

1071
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:23,281
- So he made you not have to act.
- I'd never acted with anybody like that.

1072
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:27,452
So you didn't really have to act,
you just had to respond to him.

1073
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:31,081
When I saw that close-up,

1074
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:34,626
I was sitting with some other guy
from the advertising department.

1075
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,711
He said, "What? Hey!"

1076
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,465
Well, this is quite a scene.

1077
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:44,386
Well, it's an important scene
because it progresses the story.

1078
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,305
You've still got time
to help us win the championship.

1079
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:55,730
I might have said this before,
but my father said about Clift,

1080
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:57,565
that because of his intensity

1081
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:03,154
that he sort of raised the stakes
in terms of the other actors.

1082
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,407
They all had to rise...

1083
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:10,578
That should have been my reply to you
because that's absolutely the way it was.

1084
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:13,915
He committed you to what you had to do.

1085
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,084
- So you had to be as excellent as you could.
- You just did.

1086
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,502
Absolutely.

1087
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,045
That's great.

1088
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:23,508
And it looks like
he wasn't a selfish actor to work with.

1089
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,828
I'll be glad to put
my recommendation on that, Warden.

1090
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,997
You've got service, experience, grade.

1091
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,624
- You'll make an excellent officer.
- Thank you, sir.

1092
01:19:56,709 --> 01:20:00,378
It'd be a feather in my cap, too.
A man from my company.

1093
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,048
At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?

1094
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:08,386
I remember before,
when I got this phone call...

1095
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:13,475
And that night, I called a friend of mine,
who was a bit of a close friend at the time,

1096
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,643
Lee Marvin, the actor.

1097
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,687
And I said,
"What do you think I should do?"

1098
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:24,402
He said, "Well, if you do it, and there's
a lot of people around, get in the middle."

1099
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,242
Why don't Prew go for his head?

1100
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,829
- That's you?
- That's me and Don Dubbins.

1101
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,671
I think I got in the middle.

1102
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:46,799
That was Tim Ryan,
I think, that fellow's name.

1103
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,764
Superman. There's Claude Akins.

1104
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,778
- Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!
- I'll fight any way I want!

1105
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,448
Come on, Prew! Get him!

1106
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,370
How do you think it would have been if

1107
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:20,708
the captain had been promoted to major
as the script was written,

1108
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,127
instead of the way the Army wanted it?

1109
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,922
It's so satisfying to see him put down.

1110
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,733
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

1111
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:48,319
- What's his name, Major?
- Captain Holmes, sir.

1112
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,251
There I am screaming.

1113
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,473
Ten-hut!

1114
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:19,642
At ease. What started this?

1115
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:23,771
Prewitt refused order I gave him,
talked back and started a fight.

1116
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,773
I taught him a lesson.

1117
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,234
You won't disobey
any more orders in my company, Prewitt.

1118
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:33,281
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, but Private Prewitt's not
to blame, Sergeant Galovitch started it.

1119
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,741
- Thornhill.
- Yes, sir.

1120
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,826
You're in charge of this detail.
What about it?

1121
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,828
He's right, sir. Prewitt done nothing.

1122
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:41,205
Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.

1123
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,668
That's all. Let's forget it.
Let's get back to our jobs.

1124
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:49,797
All right, back to work.
Let's go. Break it up.

1125
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:56,471
If you guys think this means
I'm stepping into a ring, you're wrong.

1126
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:57,805
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

1127
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,140
He's a nice guy.

1128
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:02,101
- Who's that?
- Claude Akins.

1129
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:04,103
I remember
he had a television series later on.

1130
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,980
He played a trucker.

1131
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,652
This is where they're playing
the Reenlistment Blues.

1132
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:11,903
Right.

1133
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,531
Took my dough to town Tuesday

1134
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:18,785
Found me a big feather bed

1135
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:23,122
Oh, a big feather bed
A big double bed

1136
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:26,542
I'll find a job tomorrow

1137
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:29,379
Tonight I'll sleep like I'm dead

1138
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:34,092
I'm gonna sleep like I'm dead

1139
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:37,470
And get up when I choose

1140
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,723
Reenlistment blues

1141
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,227
Hey, Friday.

1142
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:47,105
- Why are you called Friday?
- I don't know.

1143
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,774
But I was born on a Wednesday.

1144
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,277
I hit the bars Wednesday

1145
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:57,907
Made me some friends on my own

1146
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:01,494
Lotta friends on my own

1147
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:04,831
Found a pretty baby

1148
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:07,959
She couldn't leave me alone

1149
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,503
Oh, leave me alone

1150
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:12,922
Interesting actor, really.

1151
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,883
- Yeah.
- Done some great stuff.

1152
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,136
Reenlistment blues

1153
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,889
Reenlistment blues

1154
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,727
I had the misery Thursday

1155
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:29,230
The walls was movin' I swear

1156
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:35,486
He was known as being hard to work with
for certain directors.

1157
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:36,696
He was?

1158
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:40,408
Well, just because he had a presence,

1159
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,661
and he was intelligent,
and he knew what he wanted to do.

1160
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:46,706
He knew what looked great on the screen.

1161
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:50,835
But somehow, my father managed to
get the upper hand there.

1162
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,345
Hey, Prewitt, where you going?

1163
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,765
What do you mean, where am I going?
I'm going to Choy's.

1164
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:05,892
I'm gonna get me another beer.

1165
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,690
My hitch was up Monday

1166
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:15,610
Not a dog soldier no more

1167
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:19,155
I ain't a soldier no more

1168
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,532
Halt!

1169
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:26,621
- Who goes there?
- A friend.

1170
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,207
Advance, friend, and be recognised!

1171
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:41,260
Ten-hut!

1172
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:44,180
Right face! Rear face!

1173
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:47,225
On your knees! Scrub the floor!

1174
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:51,979
- Who was the set designer on this?
- Cary Odell.

1175
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:55,900
Hello, kid.
What are you doing out here all by yourself?

1176
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:02,490
- I'm gonna get a little drink.
- Sit down. I got a bottle.

1177
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,540
Thanks, Top.

1178
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:17,004
I gotta hand it to you, kid, the way you
beat up old Galovitch this afternoon.

1179
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:20,049
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

1180
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,852
Life's crummy, you know it?

1181
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:34,438
Yes, sir, it's miserable.
Perfectly miserable.

1182
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,191
What do you suppose would happen,

1183
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:40,194
if a truck was to come along
and run us over?

1184
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:45,032
- We'd be dead.
- You'd better not sit here any more.

1185
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,618
You'd better get up
and sit over on the side of the road.

1186
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,371
What? What do you mean, I better?

1187
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:54,876
You've got more to live for than I do.
You got your whole company to take care of.

1188
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,961
You move over, move over
to the other side of the road.

1189
01:26:57,045 --> 01:27:00,006
- Go on.
- I'm older! It don't matter if I die.

1190
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,258
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
Now, don't argue.

1191
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,552
- Go on, get up.
- No, sir, not Prewitt.

1192
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:07,763
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

1193
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:13,519
Okay, we'll stay together.

1194
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,984
I don't... I couldn't have got up anyway.

1195
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:27,325
I got the biggest troubles
in the whole world.

1196
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:32,622
In terms of the cooperation from the Army,

1197
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:38,419
I think that was achieved mainly by
Buddy Adler's contacts,

1198
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:40,838
and getting to the right people,

1199
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:47,136
and getting the support
that he needed in Hawaii.

1200
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:52,266
So he was really the one
that was principally responsible for that.

1201
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:58,189
I remember reading a lot of different notes
on different drafts of the script

1202
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,484
from Joseph Breen in the Breen Office,

1203
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:07,573
and had very specific
and ludicrous comments

1204
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,452
about who could touch who at what point,

1205
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,871
and when is it okay to show that

1206
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:19,835
Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster
are having an adulterous affair.

1207
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:25,508
And they were really very intrusive.

1208
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:31,931
And most of those things,
my father managed to ignore,

1209
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:36,519
or pretended that he was listening
and was going to do these notes,

1210
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,646
and then wound up not doing them.

1211
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:43,567
There's a couple of things that
the Breen Office insisted upon.

1212
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,905
There was a big flap
about the scene on the beach,

1213
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:56,205
in terms of censorship and of what
should be cut and what shouldn't be cut.

1214
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:02,586
And even the stills
that were used in magazines,

1215
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,423
there was a big flap about that as well.

1216
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:09,593
But for the time,

1217
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:18,227
to say anything derogatory or bad
about an institution like the Army

1218
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:22,982
was really unheard of in that day.

1219
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,400
And also,

1220
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,904
to explore an adulterous relationship

1221
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,952
in a movie about the Army
was also a big no-no.

1222
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:41,500
They rode me right out,
just like I figured.

1223
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:45,337
Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,
about a mile back...

1224
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:49,675
This is one of the famous scenes.

1225
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:53,679
This probably got Sinatra the award,
this scene.

1226
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:00,061
Prew. Prew, listen.

1227
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:03,647
Fatso done it, Prew.

1228
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:06,150
He likes to whack me in the gut.

1229
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:10,946
He asks me if it hurts,
and I spit at him like always.

1230
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:14,658
Only yesterday, it was bad.

1231
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:18,579
He hit me, he hit me, he hit me.

1232
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:23,501
I had to get out, Prew. I had to get out.

1233
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:25,920
Buddy, buddy.

1234
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:27,838
They gonna send you to the stockade, Prew?

1235
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:29,590
No, they ain't gonna send me
to the stockade.

1236
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,383
Watch out for Fatso.

1237
01:30:31,468 --> 01:30:33,385
Watch out for Fatso.

1238
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,471
He'll try to crack you.

1239
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:38,933
And if they put you in the hole,
don't yell.

1240
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:42,269
We passed the scene, the Diamond Head
scene, but there's this...

1241
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,773
I'm looking at this book
your father put together, his autobiography,

1242
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,399
in which he talks about it.

1243
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:52,029
But I should have caught that earlier,
but it's very interesting.

1244
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:53,614
Well, you want to talk about it?

1245
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,407
- Want me to read it?
- Sure.

1246
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:58,035
He says... This is Fred Zinnemann talking.

1247
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:04,959
"That scene, regarded as sensational and
extremely provocative a mere 25 years ago,

1248
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:08,254
"seems harmless and friendly
by today's standards.

1249
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:10,464
"Although it was shot very much as written,

1250
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:13,092
"the movie censors,
who knew the script by heart,

1251
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:18,430
"nevertheless insisted
on deleting four seconds of it.

1252
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:24,311
"In later years, I found that even more had
been snipped out by theatre projectionists,

1253
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,063
"as a souvenir, no doubt.

1254
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:27,148
"For many years,

1255
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:31,819
"the tourist buses used to stop routinely
at this point on the Hawaiian shoreline

1256
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:37,616
"to let people admire 'the spot where
Burt and Deborah made love in the waves.'

1257
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:42,204
"It is a curious contribution
we have made to popular culture."

1258
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:59,013
Monty Clift studied with...
It was very important to him to get the...

1259
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:04,351
Obviously, he didn't play the bugle himself,
but to get the mouth movements right,

1260
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:09,273
and he spent a good six months with,
at that time, the best bugler in the world,

1261
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:15,070
learning how to bugle, or at least
to get the mouth movements down.

1262
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:22,369
And that bugle was never out of his hand
anywhere, as I say, after the movie was over.

1263
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:27,374
And he couldn't
get himself out of the Prewitt part.

1264
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,752
He went slightly nuts with it, too.

1265
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:36,300
The other thing, just in terms of
the detail that they were looking for,

1266
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:41,347
there was a reference to Prew's character

1267
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:45,184
being from Harlan County in Kentucky.

1268
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:49,688
My father and Clift went to great lengths

1269
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:53,943
to get people in Harlan County,
to record the locals,

1270
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:58,697
so he could try to mimic their accent,

1271
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:05,287
which I don't think
anybody picks up these days,

1272
01:33:05,372 --> 01:33:09,833
but anyway, they spent a lot of time
trying to get his accent just right.

1273
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,848
Sergeant Judson?

1274
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,891
You want me?

1275
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,060
Yeah, Fatso.

1276
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,646
I don't like that nickname.

1277
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:15,399
You want to see me about something?

1278
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,360
Let's step around the corner
where we can talk.

1279
01:34:19,446 --> 01:34:21,071
Okay.

1280
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:36,003
- Are you sore about something?
- I don't like the way you play the piano.

1281
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,592
- Remember Maggio?
- Oh, the wop?

1282
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,677
Yeah, a real tough monkey.

1283
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:46,138
- You killed him.
- Did I?

1284
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:48,140
Well, if I did, he asked for it.

1285
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:51,310
The army's gonna get you
sooner or later, Fatso.

1286
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:55,147
But before they do,
I want a piece of you myself.

1287
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:59,193
I figured that.

1288
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:01,195
See this knife?

1289
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,739
It's the one you pulled on Maggio.

1290
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,216
When I was just watching this, I'm thinking

1291
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:28,889
what a great moment,
in terms of positioning and the script.

1292
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:34,478
The timing and the structure is perfect.

1293
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,148
We're ready for this right now.

1294
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:42,903
And also, there's a lot more violence
in what you don't see

1295
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:46,740
- than what you graphically do see.
- Absolutely. You're right.

1296
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:51,995
All you see are feet disappearing
behind a box, and what you imagine...

1297
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,665
- Watching life go on behind it.
- Yeah.

1298
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,667
Prew!

1299
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,462
What's...

1300
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:44,715
- Good fall.
- Very good.

1301
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,216
Prew!

1302
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,428
It's all right.

1303
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:55,434
Don't worry, don't worry.
I ain't gonna die.

1304
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:58,896
Here we go. The war's about to start.

1305
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:16,914
Do you remember how long it took
to shoot this scene that you were in?

1306
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:21,001
- This?
- Well, I mean, the part that you're in.

1307
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,920
- Not very long.
- Really?

1308
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,172
Just as long as it took
for me to run across the field.

1309
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:31,178
- Did you have to do a lot of takes?
- Three. I think we did it three times.

1310
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:37,017
I think we rehearsed it
so that I didn't fall on the explosives.

1311
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,603
But wasn't it...
You could have gotten hurt.

1312
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:43,690
Yeah, they said,
"Drop right here. Don't get any closer."

1313
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:48,153
- So it was a pretty risky thing for you to do.
- Yeah, it was.

1314
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:53,534
Were you aware of the risks
before you were doing it?

1315
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,622
I was too excited about
playing a game like a kid,

1316
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:04,211
you know, running from an aeroplane,
being shot down on a big empty lot.

1317
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:07,464
"...to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

1318
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:11,677
"As mentioned, this included the instigation
of wholly unauthorised tactics..."

1319
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:15,389
I wonder how
they communicated with the pilot,

1320
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,474
because they didn't have ground-to-air...

1321
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:22,229
I started running when the plane
was at a certain position over a building,

1322
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:24,064
and then I started to run.

1323
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:29,403
And I had done that a few times
so that we got the timing right.

1324
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:34,074
It seems to be the first thing that you forgot.

1325
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:36,827
My only regret is that
we have to keep you in uniform

1326
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:38,912
until a court-martial is concluded.

1327
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:43,834
This guy was really good,
wasn't he, the captain?

1328
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,837
There is one alternative, General,
if you are so disposed.

1329
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:52,342
This is the scene
my father couldn't stand having to do,

1330
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:56,305
because he said it was like
doing a commercial for the Army,

1331
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:58,015
and it just made him cringe.

1332
01:38:58,099 --> 01:38:59,182
Yeah.

1333
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:01,893
The quicker you're out of the army,
the better for everybody,

1334
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:04,021
especially the army.

1335
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:07,774
That's all, Holmes.

1336
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:17,200
I know what's been going on in this outfit.

1337
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:19,661
I know how far some of you
have been out of line.

1338
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:22,998
If you want to remain noncoms,
you'd better snap into it.

1339
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,459
And another thing, from now on,

1340
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:28,211
no man's gonna earn his stripes by boxing.

1341
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,133
- Get rid of those.
- Yes, sir.

1342
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,135
Dismissed.

1343
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,976
- About Sergeant Galovitch.
- Yes, sir.

1344
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:45,812
Bust him.
Sergeant Galovitch is now Private Galovitch.

1345
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:48,148
Put him in charge of the latrine.

1346
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:50,150
What are you grinning at?

1347
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,944
I think the company commander
made a wise decision, sir.

1348
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:57,908
Company "G," Captain Ross.

1349
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:03,080
- Just a minute. It's for you, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

1350
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,585
Yes, sir?

1351
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:13,507
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

1352
01:40:14,801 --> 01:40:16,009
What?

1353
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,929
I've got to see you, Milt. It's important.

1354
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:23,308
Trying to get back to that aspect of the story.

1355
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:26,103
Sure, that'd be fine.

1356
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:29,606
Yeah. I'll be there in about an hour.

1357
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:30,774
Right.

1358
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,360
- Great script.
- Yeah, I read...

1359
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:38,615
I was going through the script the other day,
and read the dialogue, and it's timeless.

1360
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,493
It's as effective today as it was then.

1361
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:44,162
When do you think
you'll get your commission?

1362
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,418
I didn't put it in.

1363
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,670
I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.

1364
01:40:51,838 --> 01:40:55,674
I took it out of my desk a dozen times,
but I couldn't sign it.

1365
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:57,718
Why?

1366
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:00,971
But it was the plan.

1367
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:03,390
- I know, I know.
- It's been weeks.

1368
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,684
You can't just say you'll do a thing
and then not do it.

1369
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:07,060
Karen, listen to me.

1370
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:09,980
But why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you tell me?

1371
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,483
Be back in a minute.

1372
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:18,822
I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

1373
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:28,665
I thought it was a guy from our company,
Prewitt, the kid I was telling you about.

1374
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:31,543
The one that got mixed up with
one of the girls at the New Congress Club.

1375
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:34,963
He's A.W.O.L. Probably in lots of trouble.

1376
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:37,591
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no good...

1377
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:42,345
Actually, Deborah Kerr did a quite believable
American accent, I thought, didn't you?

1378
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,513
Yeah.

1379
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:45,307
I like that dress.

1380
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:51,688
I've always liked that
sort of accentuating her neck.

1381
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:56,234
I know why.

1382
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,403
You don't have to become
an officer now, Milt,

1383
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,031
now that Dana's out of the army.

1384
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,658
You just don't want to marry me.

1385
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:06,411
You're already married to the army.

1386
01:42:06,496 --> 01:42:08,497
I love you, Karen.

1387
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:09,873
They don't move their heads.

1388
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,917
I always had this theory that stars,

1389
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:17,631
people who are really up front,
they do not move their heads.

1390
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:22,469
Feature players
move their heads a little more.

1391
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:25,806
And if you watch anchormen,
they never move their heads.

1392
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:29,893
And people less than anchormen
will sort of move their heads around.

1393
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:34,064
There's such authority that you get
when you don't move your head.

1394
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:38,819
And also, the wrong angle,
showing the wrong side of your face...

1395
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:40,529
When people talk.

1396
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:44,616
We'll see each other again somewhere.

1397
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:47,452
Of course we will.

1398
01:42:47,829 --> 01:42:49,663
Somewhere.

1399
01:43:03,553 --> 01:43:07,889
Here it is.
Got it on an inside page already.

1400
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:13,061
"Still no clue in the fatal stabbing
of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson."

1401
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,272
Did you hear me?

1402
01:43:18,776 --> 01:43:22,153
- Trying to set a new world's record?
- Yeah.

1403
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:25,615
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

1404
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:29,369
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt,

1405
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:32,539
holder of the new world's record.

1406
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:38,128
This is you now, isn't it?

1407
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:40,297
Ten to eight.

1408
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,851
- Everything all right, Top?
- Great.

1409
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:56,396
This is a beautiful meal
to put in front of a guy on a Sunday morning.

1410
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,316
Congratulations.

1411
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:16,666
- Sure look pretty over them mountains.
- Don't they, though?

1412
01:44:26,135 --> 01:44:28,762
Sounds like they're dynamiting
down at Wheeler Field.

1413
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:33,308
Mighty ambitious, huh?
Sunday morning before 8:00?

1414
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:44,611
Here I come.

1415
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:47,489
- There's Alvin.
- Here I come.

1416
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,284
- Now!
- Excellent.

1417
01:44:57,458 --> 01:45:00,168
I could do that today, but by accident.

1418
01:45:11,514 --> 01:45:17,143
This shot, my father always loved,
because he said it's like kicking an anthill.

1419
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,275
Look at him.

1420
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:30,407
There I am. Just lying there, a dead actor.

1421
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:33,451
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.

1422
01:45:33,536 --> 01:45:37,497
Please keep in your homes.
Do not go on the streets. This is a real attack.

1423
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,875
Japanese planes are bombing our naval
and army installations.

1424
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,587
All right, all right, you guys, quiet down.

1425
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:46,589
Quiet! Quiet down!

1426
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,926
Noncoms, get B.A.R.s
and ammunition from the supply room.

1427
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:51,886
- Get up on the roof. Henderson.
- Right here, Sarge.

1428
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:53,805
You're in charge of the loading detail.
Get moving.

1429
01:45:53,889 --> 01:45:55,390
Wilson, Dole, let's go.

1430
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:57,392
The rest of you men, listen to me.

1431
01:45:57,476 --> 01:45:59,936
I want every man to get his rifle,
go to his bunk and stay there.

1432
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:01,354
And I mean stay there!

1433
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:04,983
Shut up!

1434
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:07,736
You'll get your ears shot off
if you go outside.

1435
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,738
You wanna be heroes,
you'll get plenty of chances.

1436
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,781
There'll probably be Japs
in your lap before night.

1437
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:14,075
Now get moving. We're wasting time.

1438
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,411
Hey, come on. Hurry up.

1439
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:19,539
Wait. Into the kitchen
and make a pot of coffee.

1440
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:22,292
- Wait a minute. A barrel of coffee!
- Right, Sarge!

1441
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,230
I don't care.
I can't issue any live ammunitions

1442
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:45,565
without a signed order from an officer.

1443
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,484
- But the captain ain't here, you jerk!
- I'm sorry.

1444
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:49,444
- No order, no ammo.
- What's the matter, Leva?

1445
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,489
I got my orders!
Army regulations say that I can't give out...

1446
01:46:57,995 --> 01:46:59,621
What's the matter, are you blind?
Give me them keys!

1447
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:00,789
I obey my orders, Top.

1448
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,874
Okay, I'll see you get a medal!
Bust it down, boys!

1449
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,876
I warned ya!

1450
01:47:28,234 --> 01:47:30,151
Don't go out there, Warden!
You'll get killed!

1451
01:47:30,236 --> 01:47:32,946
Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!

1452
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,600
Give him a hand with this ammo.
Put that stuff over there.

1453
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:11,234
Watch your fire, boys,
and lead those planes!

1454
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:34,716
Friday's gone crazy!
He's blowing the cavalry charge!

1455
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,387
Here they come, boys!

1456
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:11,961
These are all tricks my father learned
from the shorts department is

1457
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:18,134
how to tell a story
without a lot of money in little time.

1458
01:49:18,219 --> 01:49:22,305
If you notice that scene,
he just had an American flag,

1459
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:27,560
saw the plane disappear behind trees,
and then he had somebody set a fireball.

1460
01:49:28,646 --> 01:49:32,732
And it was all done
very economically in one take.

1461
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,443
This is the real McCoy.

1462
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:38,905
Look out for falling shrapnel.
Keep under cover.

1463
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:42,659
Blackout and curfew restrictions
will be rigidly enforced.

1464
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:45,495
Stay in your homes.
Don't use the telephone.

1465
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:48,915
Rest assured that immediate relay to you...

1466
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:52,585
Prew! We've been to Queen's Hospital
giving blood.

1467
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:53,878
The town's a madhouse.

1468
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:55,964
There's a big house bombed out
on Kuhio Street.

1469
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:58,675
And the drugstore down
on McCully and King is smashed flat.

1470
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:02,095
- Man and his wife were killed.
- Your attention, please.

1471
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:04,889
Listen to this carefully and keep calm.

1472
01:50:04,974 --> 01:50:08,434
The danger of an invasion continues to exist,

1473
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:12,230
and the planes have been
identified as Japanese.

1474
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,983
Who do they think they're fighting?

1475
01:50:15,442 --> 01:50:18,987
They're picking trouble
with the best army in the world.

1476
01:50:20,281 --> 01:50:21,531
Where are you going?

1477
01:50:22,574 --> 01:50:25,743
I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to the company.

1478
01:50:25,828 --> 01:50:29,956
- The company? But why?
- Why?

1479
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:33,042
But you can't. You're not well yet.

1480
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:36,629
Besides, you're A.W.O.L.
They'll throw you in the stockade.

1481
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:38,715
They'll be throwing them out of the stockade.

1482
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:41,718
- They need every guy they can get.
- But your side'll open up.

1483
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:44,679
They'll find out it was you
who killed that soldier.

1484
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:48,057
Once I report in to the company,
they'll take care of me.

1485
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,976
I'll be all right once I get back.

1486
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:53,438
But you'll never make it!
There's patrols all over!

1487
01:50:53,522 --> 01:50:56,607
I'll make it. I know a shortcut.

1488
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:01,070
Prew, stay till morning.

1489
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:03,906
Maybe if you stay till morning,
you'll change your mind.

1490
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:13,333
Oh, Prew, don't go!

1491
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,501
I'll do anything you want.

1492
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:20,006
We can go back to the States together.
We can even get married.

1493
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:26,721
If you go now,
I'll never see you again, I know it.

1494
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:28,598
I'm sorry.

1495
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:36,356
What do you want to go back
to the army for?

1496
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,192
What did the army ever
do for you besides treat you like dirt

1497
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:42,862
and give you one awful going-over
and get your friend killed?

1498
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:45,406
What do you want to go back to the army for?

1499
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:48,201
What do I want to go back to the army for?
I'm a soldier.

1500
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:50,286
A soldier? A soldier?

1501
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:54,082
A regular! From the regular army!
A 30-year man!

1502
01:51:56,126 --> 01:52:00,171
I gotta turn off the lights
'cause of the blackout outside.

1503
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:16,521
They say they've seen parachutists
land up in the hills.

1504
01:52:16,605 --> 01:52:19,982
I ain't worried about them.
Saboteurs is what worries me.

1505
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:22,985
Yeah. I bet they're operating
all over these islands.

1506
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:38,478
Halt!

1507
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:42,398
Halt!

1508
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,243
Halt!

1509
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:10,801
My hitch was up Monday

1510
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:14,555
Not a dog soldier no more

1511
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:18,601
Soldier no more

1512
01:54:19,937 --> 01:54:23,856
They give me all that money

1513
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:27,693
So much my pockets is sore

1514
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:32,698
Do you know this man, Sergeant?

1515
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:34,700
Yes, sir.

1516
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:36,911
He didn't have any regular identification.

1517
01:54:36,995 --> 01:54:39,497
They found a card on him with his name.

1518
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:41,707
Seems to be a membership in a club.

1519
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,876
- The New Congress Club.
- Yes, sir.

1520
01:54:43,961 --> 01:54:46,128
You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.

1521
01:54:50,634 --> 01:54:53,511
- Was this man a friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

1522
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:56,347
He must've been trying to reach our
company position up the beach here.

1523
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:57,890
Then why didn't he halt?

1524
01:54:57,975 --> 01:55:01,060
He was always a hardhead, sir,
but he was a good soldier.

1525
01:55:01,144 --> 01:55:03,938
He loved the army
more than any soldier I ever knew.

1526
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:07,817
I see. I'm sorry, Sergeant.

1527
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:19,912
James Jones wrote to Buddy Adler in a letter
about the ending of the movie

1528
01:55:22,416 --> 01:55:25,501
and what he hoped would be conveyed.

1529
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:31,924
And what he said he wanted to show
was that life goes on, people move on.

1530
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:36,429
Prew's death is nothing but a small ripple

1531
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:40,099
in a vast moving tide
that stops to mourn for no man.

1532
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:45,771
He said,
"If you get that right, you've got the movie."

1533
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:48,149
We ain't got all night!

1534
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:12,131
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

1535
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:20,139
I think it's the most beautiful place
I ever saw in my life.

1536
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:24,310
I can almost see where I worked from here.

1537
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:30,191
Well, it's a great way for me to end my...

1538
01:56:31,485 --> 01:56:35,905
Or put some sort of a period
on my connection with this movie,

1539
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:40,493
starting with washing my car
one Saturday afternoon,

1540
01:56:40,577 --> 01:56:43,663
and being here with Tim,

1541
01:56:43,747 --> 01:56:49,335
and thinking about
my whole history with Fred Zinnemann

1542
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:53,255
and how he played a big part in my career.

1543
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:56,842
I'm honoured.

1544
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:04,016
I have to say,
I'm delighted to be here today with Alvin,

1545
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:07,687
who not only do I know separately
from my father,

1546
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:12,191
having worked with him
on a movie called Straight Time,

1547
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:14,777
but also through my father on Julia,

1548
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:20,282
and from having heard all the stories
about him on From Here to Eternity.

1549
01:57:21,702 --> 01:57:26,539
I think it was wonderful
to watch this movie again,

1550
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:29,875
and to see how it holds up today,

1551
01:57:30,627 --> 01:57:34,213
and how truly wonderful it was then
and still is today.

1552
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:41,220
And I hope everybody that is going
to see it now likes it as much as I do.

1553
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,117
