马吉欧  你好
Hey Maggie Hello

18
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,860
你好  普威特
Hiya Prew.

19
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,820
你怎么会来这里
What are you doing over here?

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,160
我从薛福特堡被调过来
Transferred over from Fort Shafter.

21
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,030
-你离开号角兵团了吗  -是的
- You quit the Bugle Corps? - Yep.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,450
-为了来这里  -不是我自己选的
- For here? - I didn't pick it.

23
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,410
你严重搞错了
Oh you made a very bad mistake.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,670
他们可以把这个军团还给卡斯特将军
This outfit they can give back to General Custer.

25
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,170
是吗
Yeah?

26
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,550
上尉还没进办公室
Captain ain't in yet.

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,180
我四处去看看
I'll look around.

28
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,410
你以为你在干什么
What do you think you're doing'?

29
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,200
-你叫什么名字  -普威特  从薛福特堡调来
- What's your name? - Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,540
我听说过你
I heard about you.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,120
我也听说过你  上士
I heard about you too Sergeant.

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,210
这里是步兵团
This here's a rifle outfit Prewitt.

33
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,090
你在太阳下山前不该玩乐的
You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself before sundown.

34
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,550
把球杆收起来  跟我来
Put up your cue and come along.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,310
葛兰昨天去过医院
Grand went to the hospital yesterday. Did you put him in the sick book?

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,690
-你的报告写好了吗  -我还没有时间写  上士
- Did you make out the morning report? - I didn't have time Sergeant.

37
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,900
你是文书官
You're the company clerk Mazzioli.

38
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,440
医官很晚才将病历送来
Those medics didn't bring back the sick book till late yesterday.

39
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,070
-我马上就会写的  -多谢  我已经替你写好了
- I'll tend to it right now. - Thanks. I already done it for you.

40
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,370
你是薛福特堡最棒的号手
You're the best bugler they got over at Shafter.

41
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,660
也是全岛最棒的
You're the best bugler they got on this whole island.

42
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,210
那倒是事实
That's true.

43
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,540
我同情你
I feel for you pal.

44
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,170
但站在我的立场  我还是不了解你
But from my position I can't quite reach you.

45
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,890
立正
Ten-hut

46
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,890
-稍息  -早安  长官
- At ease. - Morning sir.

47
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,650
有什么特别的事吗
Morning men. Anything special for me this morning Sergeant Warden?

48
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,440
-我只有几分钟时间  -是的  长官  有新兵报到
- I've only a few minutes. - Yes sir. New man here.

49
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,570
是的  进来
Oh yes. Come in.

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,160
长官  罗勃普威特大兵
Sir Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,200
向连长报到
Reporting to the company commander as ordered.

52
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,210
稍息  服役纪录呢
At ease. Where's that service record?

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,290
生于肯塔基州  在维州梅尔堡入伍
Born in Kentucky enlisted first at Fort Myer Virginia.

54
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,710
第一号手
"Bugle Corps First Bugler."

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,340
我通常会跟新报到的人谈谈
Prewitt I always make it a policy to talk to my new men.

56
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,470
本军团的运作很顺利
Now I have a fine smooth-running outfit.

57
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,430
如果我欣赏某位士兵
If I like a soldier he can get to be a noncommissioned officer

58
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,970
他便能迅速升任无委任状士官
quicker here than anywhere else.

59
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,020
但他得让我看看他够精明
But he has to show me that he's got it on the ball.

60
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,060
你在号角兵团惹了什么麻烦
What kind of trouble were you in in the Bugle Corps?

61
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,900
-没有惹麻烦  长官  -那么你为何请调
- No trouble sir. - What made you transfer out then?

62
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,030
那是个人因素
It was a personal matter.

63
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,110
-你有什么想问的吗  上士  -是的  长官
- Something you wanted to ask Sergeant? - Why yes sir.

64
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,620
普威特  你原是下士
Prewitt you was a corporal in the Bugle Corps.

65
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,910
你却自动降为大兵  调至步兵团
You took a bust to buck private to transfer to an infantry outfit.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,410
为什么  是因为你喜欢步行
Why? Because you like to hike?

67
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,000
还是你受不了吹号角
Or was it because you couldn't stand to bugle?

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,090
完全是个人因素
It was a personal matter.

69
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,670
这由连长决定
That's up to the company commander to decide.

70
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,800
是怎么样
Well?

71
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,510
我担任了两年的第一号手
I was First Bugler for two years.

72
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,760
但军士长的朋友调了进来
The topkick had a friend who transferred in from another outfit.

73
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,350
第二天他便成了第一号手
The next day he was made First Bugler over me.

74
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,350
我吹号的技巧比他好
I was a better bugler.

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,690
你因此而离开
And you asked out on account of that?

76
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,520
或许是有些不太理智
Maybe it ain't sensible but that's the reason.

77
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,530
他的情感受到伤害  他们现在给我们的人手是这样的
His feelings were hurt. Kids they send us now

78
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,700
我们会恢复你的官阶
Well we'll get your stripes back for you maybe

79
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,030
或许还让你升官
an extra one for good measure.

80
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,620
你知道你为何在参谋本部
Do you know why you were assigned to "G" Company?

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,660
不知道  长官
No sir.

82
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,790
我利用了一些关系  我现在是军团的拳击教练
I pulled a few strings. I'm the regimental boxing coach you know.

83
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,710
是的  长官
Yes sir.

84
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,040
两年前我看了你和康纳斯的一场拳击赛
I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl year before last.

85
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,880
-你本应该打赢康纳斯的  -谢谢你  长官
- You should have won it. - Thank you sir.

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,420
去年我们在决赛时败北
Our regiment got beaten in the finals last December

87
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,220
但今年我一定要获胜
but I mean to win this year.

88
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,380
我需要中量级的好手
All I've needed was a top middleweight.

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
很抱歉  长官  我已不打拳了
I'm sorry sir. I quit fighting.

90
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,520
不打拳  为什么
Quit fighting? When? What for?

91
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,730
一年多前
Well over a year ago.

92
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,810
或许你听说过  迪西威尔斯的事
Maybe you heard about what happened with Dixie Wells?

93
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,520
你是指受伤的那家伙
You mean that fellow that got hurt?

94
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,690
-是的  长官  -我是听说过
- Yes sir. - Yes I heard about that.

95
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,990
我能了解你的感受  那种事难免会发生
It's too bad. I can understand how you feel. But those things happen.

96
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,320
他是我不打的原因  长官
That's why I decided I would quit sir.

97
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,580
你不能因为死了一个人  就说"停战"
You might as well say stop war because one man got killed.

98
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,210
我们的拳击课程  是最能提振士气的
Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have.

99
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,840
军团已经有一位走音的号手
I've got a mighty sour company bugler.

100
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,550
-你喜欢这工作吗  -如果要打拳就不喜欢
- How'd you like the job? - Not if it means fighting.

101
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,250
你打算取得
Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire

102
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,520
独行侠的声誉吗
a reputation as a lone wolf Prewitt.

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,520
军队里不能有个人主义存在
You should know that in the army it's not the individual that counts.

104
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,770
军团不会对你施加压力
Well you'll find that we won't put any pressure on you in my outfit.

105
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,320
你只要不犯错就行了
Just don't make any mistakes in it that's all.

106
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,160
我要进城去  还有事吗
I've got to go into town. Anything else for me today Sergeant?

107
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,450
军团的预算报告明天就要交了
The company fund report has got to be made out it's due tomorrow.

108
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,830
-你写吧  没有其他了  -没有  长官
- You make it out. Is that all? - No sir.

109
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,290
由你全权处理
Well whatever it is you fix it up.

110
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,790
下午如果有事  代签我的名字
If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon sign my name.

111
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,040
-我不会回来了  -是的  长官
- I won't be back. - Yes sir.

112
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,460
如果不是我在后面替他打理
He'd strangle in his own spit if he didn't have me around here

113
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,470
他早就完蛋了
to swab his throat out for him.

114
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,090
走吧
Come on.

115
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,520
你已从军五年  五年半
You been in the army what now Prewitt? Five years? Five and a half?

116
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,610
是的
Yeah.

117
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,740
你不认为是时候  该学聪明些了吗
Don't you think it's about time you got smart?

118
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,320
你拒绝了炸药荷姆斯
You know what you did just now when you turned down Dynamite Holmes?

119
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,680
等于是自找死路
You put your head in a noose.

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,450
当拳击手很轻松
Things are softer for a boxer in this outfit.

121
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,250
你最好学学怎么当兵
Otherwise you'd better know how to soldier.

122
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,620
我当得和任何人一样好
I can soldier with any man.

123
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,970
这里快变成夏威夷皇家饭店了
This place is getting' to be like the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

124
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,770
-她是谁
Who is that?

125
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,480
她是荷姆斯上尉夫人
She's Captain Holmes' wife.

126
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,070
你会被逼赛拳
You'll fight Prewitt.

127
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,280
因为荷姆斯上尉  想成为荷姆斯少校
You'll fight because Captain Holmes wants to be Major Holmes.

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,240
他认为赢得拳赛就能升官
He's got an idea he'll make it if he gets a winning team.

129
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,780
就算不为他  也为了我
And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me.

130
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,740
我的工作就是让他高兴
'Cause my job is to keep him happy see?

131
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,800
他愈高兴  就愈不会来烦我
The more he's happy the less he bothers me

132
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,040
而且我就会把他的军团  管理得更好
and the better I run this company.

133
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,750
我们清楚我们的立场吧
So we know where we stand don't we kid?

134
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,670
我知道自己的立场  不依他的人将一事无成
I know where I stand. A man don't go his own way he's nothing.

135
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,680
在拓荒时期或许还可以
Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way

136
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,220
但是现在你必须照章行事
but today you've gotta play ball.

137
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,060
列瓦
Leva

138
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,890
我能不能走进来之后
Can't I once walk up to the supply room

139
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,440
看到你用双手在工作呢
and find you working with both hands?

140
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,320
你们付我的薪水根本不够
I can't do no better on what you people pay me

141
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,030
替这个人准备些用品  寝室在顶楼
Draw this man some supplies. "G" Company squad room's on the top floor.

142
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,820
把你的袋子放好后再回来
Get rid of your bags and come back here.

143
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,520
列瓦会帮你
Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.

144
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,830
可以替你省下四五趟路
Save you making four or five trips.

145
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,410
-谢谢  -我不喜欢浪费体力
- Thanks. - I just hate to see energy wasted.

146
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,920
你会需要你的体力的
Besides you'll be needing yours.

147
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,960
他看来是个好人
Looks like a good man.

148
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,420
我了解他这种人  他是死脑筋
I know his type. He's a hardhead.

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,310
大热天她还穿毛衣
Her and them sweaters.

150
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,610
我想她一定冷若冰霜
I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.

151
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,110
不会的  军士长  她很懂世故的
Not her Top. She knows the score like I been telling you.

152
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,860
-是吗  -别在这里听
- Is that right? - Listen not around here.

153
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,860
我在布里斯堡听说
But when I soldiered at Fort Bliss with Holmes

154
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,240
很多关于这女士的事
I heard plenty about this lady plenty.

155
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,450
-是吗  -好吧  不用告诉我了
- You did huh? - Okay not me.

156
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,790
我认识她的伴侣  所以你不用告诉我了
But I know some of the guys she played around with so don't tell me.

157
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,630
我没有  是你在告诉我
I ain't telling you. You're telling me.

158
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,090
-早安  上士  -早安  夫人
- Good morning Sergeant. - Morning ma'am.

159
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,510
我来找我丈夫
I'm looking for my husband.

160
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,350
他到城里公干去了
Captain Holmes just went into town ma'am on business.

161
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,810
他说有东西留给我  你知道吗
He was to have left some things for me. Do you know anything about them?

162
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,890
不知道  夫人  我能效劳吗
No I don't ma'am. Anything I can do for you?

163
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,190
不用了  谢谢
No thanks.

164
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,190
我很乐意效劳的  夫人
I'd be glad to help ma'am.

165
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,950
我丈夫告诉我很多你的事  上士
My husband's been telling me a lot about you Sergeant.

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
-他说你做事的效率很高  -是的  夫人
- He says you're very efficient. - Yes ma'am.

167
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,130
你为何如此有效率  上士
What is it that makes you so efficient Sergeant?

168
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,840
因为我天生聪颖  夫人
I was born smart ma'am.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,590
我喜欢这个说法  再见了  上士
I love that. Well goodbye Sergeant.

170
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,260
她可真是啊  对吧
Man she sure is one ain't she?

171
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,810
-真是什么  -真是尤物
- One what? - One woman.

172
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,850
我看过更美的
I've seen better.

173
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,200
凯伦  凯伦
Karen? Karen?

174
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,040
对不起  我回来晚了  -没有关系
- Sorry I'm late. - It doesn't matter.

175
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,170
我在军官乐部
I got tied up with General Slater.

176
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,170
-被史莱特将军缠住了  -恩
- I bumped into him in the Officer's Club. - Yeah?

177
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,930
-将军说了些什么  -他说要成功
- What did the General have to say? - Success he said.

178
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,140
战时要成功  和平时更要成功
Success in war success in peace time.

179
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,640
对我的升官却一句也没提
And not a word about my promotion.

180
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,140
有时我觉得他想降我职
Sometimes I think the old man's just waiting to ship me down.

181
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,650
少去奉承将军们
Well if you'd spend less time buttering generals

182
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,150
多跟你的军团在一起
and more time with your company you'd get that promotion.

183
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,150
军团可以照顾自己
The company takes care of itself.

184
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,070
我今天去找过你
I went over there today looking for you.

185
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,320
我到卡纳欧黑办事
I had some business to attend to at Kaneohe.

186
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,620
你不介意吧
That was all right wasn't it?

187
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,910
当然  我没有权利过问
Of course. I have no right to inquire into your actions.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,250
-那是我们同意的  -为什么要提起这件事
- That was our agreement. - Then why bring it up?

189
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,200
我可不是你
Because I wanted you to know

190
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,340
认为的那种笨女人
I'm not as stupid as you maintain all women are.

191
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,380
这话什么意思
Now just what does that mean?

192
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,050
-你又在指控什么了  -没事
- What are you accusing me of now? - Of nothing.

193
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,670
你跟多少女人出去
It's no longer any of my business

194
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,220
也不干我的事  对吧
how many women you go outwith is it?

195
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,100
但我希望你能诚实
But I wish you could just be honest about it once.

196
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,890
为什么要隐瞒
There's no reason I should try to hide anything is there?

197
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,770
我们之间已经这样了
The way things are between us now

198
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,320
你凭什么一直这样指控我
what right have you to always be accusing me?

199
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,230
凭什么
What right?

200
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,240
你还要再翻旧帐吗
Are you going back to that again?

201
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,080
我还得忍受多久
How long will it be I wonder before I'm allowed to live that down?

202
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,660
我得跟你说几次那是意外
How many times do I have to tell you it was an accident?

203
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,670
拜托你  唐纳  我要睡了
Please Dana. I'm going to bed.

204
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,000
请离开我的卧房
Please get out of my bedroom.

205
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,870
荷姆斯上尉说你不想打拳
Captain Holmes says you don't want to come out and fight for us.

206
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,790
没错
That's right.

207
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,790
我请你⒈啤酒而且谈一谈
We thought we'd buy you a beer and talk it over.

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,830
我们是军团的拳击手
We're the company boxers.

209
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,040
我猜也是
I figured.

210
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,180
我真希望他在
Man what I would not give to have this character

我家乡的弹子房
in the corner pool room in my hometown.

212
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,690
如果你跟以前一样打得好  我们就赢定了
Box as good as you used to we'd be a cinch this year.

213
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,530
别忘了  区冠军还可以  放十天的假
You ain't forget division champs get 10-day furloughs did you son?

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,870
我是艾克葛罗维奇  是你的排长
I'm Ike Galovitch platoon guide of your platoon.

215
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,370
别以为你很强悍  普威特
And don't think you're a tough guy Prewitt.

216
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,040
现在不说话  到野外可就要喊救命了
You no talk now but out in the field with us you sing different song.

217
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,550
如果他不想打拳
Listen the guy don't have to fight

218
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,630
就用不打
if he don't want to without getting' kicked around.

219
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,380
我们正在打撞球  走开
Now we're playing pool. Why don't you take off?

220
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,470
-你讨打吗  马吉欧  -不
- You want busted head Maggio? - No.

221
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,470
你最好少管闲事
Then keep your big nose out altogether.

222
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,970
下礼拜开始集训
Training season starts next week. You can pick up your stuff...

223
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,470
我已告诉过荷姆斯
Look I told Holmes and I'm telling you.

224
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,690
现在我告诉你  我不打拳了
I ain't fighting. I quit fighting.

225
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,020
我已经不打拳了  你们可以尽管威胁我
You guys want to put the screws on go right ahead

226
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,240
-你想做什么  我能忍受  -好了  普威特
- I can take anything you can dish out. - Okay Prewitt.

227
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,790
谢谢
Thanks.

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,580
我不喜欢看到好人被欺负
I just hate to see a good guy get it in the gut.

229
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,540
习惯吧  小子
You better get used to it kid.

230
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,050
你在死之前  会常见到的
You'll probably see a lot of it before you die.

231
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,970
你真够胆  对吧
You don't scare easy do you Prewitt?

232
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,690
军队有规定我一定要打拳吗
Do you know anything in army regulations says I gotta box?

233
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,600
本军团的每个拳手都是  无委任状士官
Every boxer in this outfit's a noncom.

234
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,030
你不曾见过他们

聚集在一起给某人特别训练
them get together and give a man the treatment.

236
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,570
你怎么会称她小妞  她已经四十五岁了
What do you mean "chick"? She's 45.

237
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,910
对你来说还太年轻
She's still too young for you.

238
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,410
我比你好多了  别忘了
Now listen Warden I'm a better man than you any day and don't forget it.

239
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,210
我不会忘的
I won't forget it.

240
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,540
华登是怎么回事
What's the deal with him anyway?

241
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,960
我不了解他
With Warden. I don't figure him.

242
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,920
华登
Warden?

243
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,970
他不像别人
He ain't like the others.

244
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,100
他会对你很严厉
He'll make it tough on you.

245
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,600
但他会划定一条公平界线  而且会谨守份际
But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair and he won't come over it.

246
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,310
现在很少有这种军士长了
You don't see many topkicks like him no more.

247
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,320
他在十五军团时  在上海作战
He was with the 15th in Shanghai when they saw their action.

248
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,110
连在菲律宾的我  也听说过他的战绩
I heard about it down in the Philippines even.

249
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,410

来福枪是你最好的朋友

如果在战斗中卡住了  可能会让你丧命
In case it jams in combat it could mean life or death.

277
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,570
你一定得学会蒙着眼
So you gotta learn to strip them down and put

278
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,610
也可以组合与拆解
them back together again blindfolded.

279
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,300
你的后瞄准器不准
Your rear sight's way off.

280
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,970
你在瞄准三百码时会误失五十尺
You'd be 50 feet off target at 300 yards.

281
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,070
士兵不了解他的武器
Now that's what happens when a soldier don't know

282
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,550
就会发生这种状况

跑七圈  把枪举在胸前

懂了吗  普威特
Wide open huh Prewitt?

290
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,930
或许再七圈你就懂了
Maybe seven more laps will teach you to watch yourself.

291
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,050
你疯了  我看到你做的事了

她是个大麻烦
I'm telling you Top she's nothing but trouble.

293
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,450
别再想你在想的了
You better keep your mind off what you're thinking.

294
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,450
你想在李汶渥斯监狱终老吗
What do you wanna do wind up in Leavenworth?

295
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,550
我赶不上归营号了
I won't be back in time to take retreat Sergeant.

296
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,390
-或起床号  -是的  长官
- Or reveille either. - Yes sir.

297
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,640
只管工作没有娱乐  上士
All work and no play Sergeant.

298
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,600
你只会做文书工作
All you do is sit around sweating over papers.

299
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,480
除了工作还有其他事情
There are other things in the world besides work.

300
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,540
多多出去走走  华登
You ought to get out more yourself Warden.

301
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,070
我一直在考虑这件事
I've been considering it.

302
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,450
我要走了  事情就留给你处理  上士
Well I'm going. I'm leaving it in your care Sergeant.

303
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,080
你回来时全部都会做好  长官
It'll be here when you get back sir.

304
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,360
原来是华登上士
Well if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

305
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,950
快进来  你会被雨淋湿
You'd better step inside or you'll get wet.

306
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,540
我已经湿透了
I am wet.

307
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,500
如果你想找上尉  他不在家
If you're looking for the captain he isn't here.

308
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,790
假设我找的不是他呢
And if I'm not looking for him?

309
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,800
他还是不在
He still isn't here.

310
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,210
我是要找他  你知道他在哪里吗
Well I'm looking for him. Do you know where he is?

311
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,970
我不晓得
I haven't the slightest idea.

312
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,340
或许他又"到城里公干"
Perhaps he's "in town on business."

313
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,510
前几天你是这么说的  对吧
That's the way you put it the other day isn't it?

314
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,430
我有些重要文件得请他签名
I got some papers it's important for him to sign.

315
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,520
我打电话到俱乐部试试
I'll try phoning him at the club. Maybe he's there.

316
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,980
别那么做
Don't do that.

317
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,990
我不想打扰他的酒兴
I never like to disturb a man when he's drinking.

318
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,870
我自己也想⒁槐
I could use a drink myself.

319
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,660
你要邀我进去吗
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

320
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,510
酒就在那边柜子里  上士
The liquor's there Sergeant in the cabinet.

321
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,730
你冒了极大的危险
You're taking an awful chance you know.

322
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,230
我的女佣随时可能会到家
My maid is liable to be home any time.

323
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,020
星期四是她的公休日
No she won't. Thursday's her day off.

324
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
你一切都想好了  是吗
You think of everything don't you Sergeant?

325
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,240
我试着  这个职务必须如此
I try. In my position you have to.

326
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,370
这真的很重要吗
Are these really important?

327
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,880
是的  但明天也可以
Yes. But not important to get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.

328
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,430
我还有副本  很容易就能处理
I got copies at the office so it won't be much work to fix them up.

329
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,140
我喜欢  上士  你很有自信
That's what I like about you Sergeant. You have confidence.

330
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
这也是我不喜欢你的地方
It's also what I dislike about you.

331
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,310
这不是自信而是诚实
It's not confidence ma'am. It's honesty.

332
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,230
我不愿意见到美人独守空闺  浪费了
I just hate to see a beautiful woman going all to waste.

333
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,190
你是说浪费吗
"Waste " did you say?

334
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,610
我可以告诉你很多跟这有关的事
There's a subject I might tell you something about.

335
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,700
我知道好几种浪费  上士
I know several kinds of waste Sergeant.

336
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,160
你可能不知道其中一些
You're probably not even remotely aware of some of them.

337
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,490
你有兴趣听听吗
Would you like to hear?

338
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,170
比如家里没有孩子
For instance what about the house without a child?

339
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,580
也可以算是一种
There's one sort for you.

340
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,340
还有另外一种
Then there's another.

341
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,010
你干得好  上士
You're doing fine Sergeant.

342
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,350
我丈夫在休假
My husband's off somewhere

343
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,470
外头下着雨  而我们两个都在喝酒
and it's raining outside and we're both drinking now.

344
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,270
或许你只误判了一件事  那就是夫人我
You've probably only got one thing wrong the lady herself.

345
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,270
或许我并不像外表那样
The lady's not what she seems.

346
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,440
如果你明白我的意思  她过气了
She's a washout if you know what I mean.

347
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,280
我相信你明白我的意思
And I'm sure you know what I mean.

348
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,450
你想哭吗
You gonna cry?

349
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,330
我一定忍住不哭
Not if I can help it.

350
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,170
你在做什么
What are you doing?

351
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,180
我要走了  那不是你所希望的吗
I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?

352
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,180
我不知道  上士  我不知道
I don't know Sergeant. I don't know.

353
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,760
加把劲男孩
Step on it boy

354
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,260
-快一点  -我是很快
- Speed it up. - I'm speeding.

355
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,850
够了  马吉欧  你想领钱吗  别闹了
All right Maggio. You wanna get paid? Knock it off.

356
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,020
安杰罗  1美元  他不该出现的
Angelo a dollar he's wrong coming up.

357
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,650
嘿  老兄  过来
Hey paisan come here

358
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,820
对不起  我已经赢了不少钱
Sorry gentlemen I already won my bankroll in the latrine.

359
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,950
而且你们赌注太少
Besides it's a penny-ante game.

360
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,700
好了  你这里藏得什么
All right what are you covering here?

361
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,710
快点  小子  我们要进城去
Come on buddy boy we're goon' to town.

362
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,930
别让他们惹恼你
Look don't let them get your goat.

363
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,780
我们可以穿便服
We'll just dress up in civvies

364
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,560
看起来跟别人一样帅
and we're as good as the rest of the world ain't we?

365
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,730
来  穿这件
Here wear this.

366
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,400
是我姐姐寄来的  她买的东西都太大了些
My sister sent it to me. She buys everything too big.

367
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,110
我们先去几家酒吧逛逛
Look first we'll hit a few bars see?

368
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,160
我是新国会俱乐部的会员
Then we go to a place of which I'm a member the New Congress Club.

369
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,080
女孩们
Girls.

370
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,910
你对女人有偏见吗
You got any prejudices against girls?

371
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,750
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

372
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,920
你已经为今晚准备整齐了
Well now looks like you're all primed for a big night Top.

373
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,130
-你好  斯塔尔克  -你想找个伴吗
- Hello Stark. - Want some company?

374
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,180
不用了  谢谢  我都约好了
No thanks. All tied up.

375
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,970
列瓦说你在觊觎上尉的老婆
Leva tells me you've been eyeing the captain's wife

376
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,850
就像猎狗在狩猎时一样
like a hound dog at hunting time.

377
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,850
他这么说吗  他还告诉你什么
He has huh? What else did that character tell you?

378
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,520
她在布里斯堡跟过很多男人
She took up with a lot of men back there at Fort Bliss.

379
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,150
我对那些故事没信心
Well I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.

380
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,780
这可不是故事  因为我也是其中之一
This ain't no story 'cause I was one of them myself.

381
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,030
只是为期不长  她真的有点奇怪
Not for long though. Sure is something strange about that woman.

382
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,780
谢谢你的提醒
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

383
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,790
回头见
See ya.

384
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,420
你好
Hello.

385
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,470
-我没想到你会来  -为什么不  我并没有迟到
- I didn't think you were coming. - Why not? I ain't late.

386
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,300
没有  但是我早到了
No I guess you're not. But then I got here a little early.

387
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,100
我一定是太过焦虑了  但是你没有
I must have been overanxious. You weren't though were you?

388
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,890
我先去⒘思副
I stopped along the way for a couple of drinks.

389
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,270
好美的地点
You certainly chose a lovely spot for our meeting.

390
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,110
五分钟内就有三个人来约我
I've had three chances to be picked up in the last five minutes.

391
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,320
对这样来说是差不多
Well that's par for the course around here.

392
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,450
我不在意  我从不曾有过秘密恋情
Well I don't care for it. I never went in much for back-alley loving.

393
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,490
放轻松
Take it easy.

394
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,240
你一定认为我是水性杨花
You probably think I'm a tramp.

395
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,750
你为什么认为我会那样想
Now what makes you think I'd think a thing like that?

396
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,960
用不着这么客气  上士
Don't try to be gallant Sergeant.

397
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,000
如果这是个错误  直说无妨
If you think this is a mistake come right out and say so.

398

Not even one? Out of all the men you've been kissed by?

520
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,150
那可得好好算算
Now that'd take some figuring.

521
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,240
-你想有多少人  -我不知道
- How many men do you think there've been? - I wouldn't know.

那么我想你是不会知道
Then I guess you won't find out will you?

525
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,170
或许我已经知道了
Maybe I already know.

526
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,590
怎么了  你在暗示什么
What's the matter? What are you hinting at?

有什么好暗示的吗
Why? ls there something to hint at?

528
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,560
搞不好有过很多海滩派对
Maybe there's been a long line of beach parties.

529
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,220
-你一定是疯了  -是吗
- You must be crazy. - Am I?

530
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,480
你跟荷姆斯  在布里斯堡又如何
What about when you and Holmes were back at Fort Bliss?

531
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,820
你听说过史塔克大兵吗  梅隆史塔克
Did you ever hear of a soldier named Stark? Maylon Stark?

532
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,320
是  知道的
Why yes.

533
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,490
"是知道的"你也认识他  对吧
"Why yes." You knew him too didn't you?

534
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,490
对吧
Didn't you?

535
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,750
你跟其他人都一样
I had to go and forget you were like all the rest of them.

536
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,630
那些事都是真的  对吧  对不对
Only it's true ain't it? Well ain't it?

537
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,640
你为什么不告诉我
Why don't you tell me about it? Tell me the story.

538
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,810
总是有故事的
There's always a story.

539
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,890
你不留给任何人任何余地  对吧
You don't leave a person anything do you?

540
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,830
回来  上士  我会把故事告诉你
Come back here Sergeant. I'll tell you the story.

541
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,920
你可以把故事带回营区
You can take it back to the barracks with you.

542
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,260
我只结婚了两年  就发现他有外遇
I'd only been married to Dana two years when I found out he was cheating.

543
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:29,190
当时我已经怀孕  让我有了可以期待的事
And by that time I was pregnant. I thought I had something to hope for.

544
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,480
阵痛开始那晚  我差点觉得高兴
I was almost happy the night the pains began.

545
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,610
唐纳去出席军官会议
I remember Dana was going to an officer's conference.

546
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,030
我告诉他要早点带医生回来
I told him to get home early to bring the doctor with him.

547
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,850
那会议不是和女人开的话
And maybe he would have if his conference hadn't been

548
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,910
他就会照办
with a hat check girl.

549
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,370
他到了凌晨五点才⒆砹嘶乩
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

550
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,620
当时我躺在地板上
I was lying on the floor.

551
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,660
我求他去找医生
I begged him to go for the doctor

552
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,630
可是他醉倒在沙发上
but he fell on the couch and passed out.

553
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,630
孩子在一小时后生了下来
The baby was born about an hour later.

554
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,130
当然是死了  是一个男孩
Of course it was dead. It was a boy.

555
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,340
他们送我到医院急救
But they worked over me at the hospital. They fixed me up fine.

556
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,140
他们救活了我  还免费替我割了盲肠
They even took my appendix out. They threw that in free.

557
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,230
-凯伦  -还有一件事  我也不能生育了
- Karen? - And one more thing. No more children.

558
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,190
我是跟男人出游  看看我能否找到一个
Sure I went out with men after that and if I'd ever found one that...

559
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,440
凯伦  听我说
Karen listen to me. Listen.

560
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,320
我知道
I know.

561
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,120
直到我遇见你  我也认为这是不可能的
Until I met you I didn't think it was possible either.

562
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,720
我也到军中服务
I enlisted too.

563
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,680
独自一人离开奥勒冈的家
I came out here on my own to get away from my hometown in Oregon.

564
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,770
怎么会
How come?

565
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,150
我原本是个女侍
I had a boyfriend.

566
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,610
我男友来自最富裕的家庭
I was a waitress and he was from the richest family in town.

567
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,190
他娶了一个符合地位的女孩
He just married a girl suitable for his position.

568
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,280
当时他已与我交往了三年
After three years of going around with me.

569
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,280
很棒的故事吧  这个故事可以写一本书
It's a pretty story isn't it? Maybe they could write a book about it.

570
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,490
写过了  太多人写了
They did. Thousands of them.

571
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,500
所以我离家到了西雅图
So I left and went to Seattle.

572
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,870
我遇见一个从夏威夷回去的女孩
I got there and I met a girl just back from Hawaii

573
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,210
她在那里赚了大钱
and she said she'd made a lot of money working there.

574
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,000
所以我搭上第一班船
So I caught the first boat.

575
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,010
我已经来这里一年两个月
I've been here a year and two months.

576
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,220
而你并不喜欢不是吗
You don't like it very much do you?

577
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,300
我是不喜欢但我并不在意  我不会永远待在这里
Oh I don't like it but I don't mind it. Anyway I won't be here forever.

578
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,140
当然不会  为什么要呢
No. Sure. I mean why should you?

579
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,920
再过一年我就会赚了很多钱
I got it all figured out. In another year I'll be home

580
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,980
回家去了
with a stocking full of money.

581
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,310
之后我可以重新过生活
And I'll be all set for life.

582
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,980
哪一位
Who is it?

583
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,370
我没有听到争吵声  所以以为你们也想⒁槐
I didn't hear no sounds of combat so I thought you might want a drink.

584
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,120
你独占那瓶威士忌  安杰罗
- You've been hogging the whiskey Angelo. - Not me buddy.

585
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,330
不是我  是珊卓拉  她是很好可是太会⒕屏
It's that Sandra. She's a nice girl but she drinks like a fish.

586
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,920
我希望下面有警察
I hope there's a cop under that.

587
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,010
继续倒
Keep pouring. Keep pouring.

588
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,230
不了  谢谢  我不⒕  我觉得那是个缺点
No thanks. I don't drink. I think it's a weakness.

589
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,350
我允许你的看法
I grant you that.

590
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,980
我不喜欢缺点  你呢
I don't like weakness. Do you?

591
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,200
不喜欢  但我想喝酒
No I don't like weakness but I like to drink.

592
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,830
你要嫁给这家伙吗
Hey what are you gonna do marry this guy?

593
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,330
你对他笑的样子好像是他老婆
You're grinning at him like you're his wife.

594
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,830
滚出去
Get out of here.

595
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,290
好
Okay okay. I'm goon.

596
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,630
我要回去找长腿珊卓拉
Back to old long-legged Sandra. I love them tall.

597
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,170
我喜欢腿长  绵延不绝
Acres and acres.

598
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,980
好好享受  老兄  你比我更需要这个
Enjoy yourself paisan. You need this more than I do.

599
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,980
明天你得继续接受特训
Tomorrow you'll be back with the treatment.

600
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,520
他是什么意思
What does he mean?

601
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,820
你在他面前依偎在我身边真好
Hey that was nice before the way you snuggled up in front of him.

602
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,160
什么是特训
What's a "treatment"?

603
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,530
有些人因为我不打拳
Oh some of the guys putting me over the jumps

604
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,330
所以对我施压
'cause I don't want to fight.

605
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,790
打拳
Fight?

606
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,760
是的  参加拳击队
Yeah on a boxing team. I don't want to box.

607
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,340
我不想打拳击
I don't even want to think about it.

608
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,920
你为什么一定要打拳呢
Well why should you have to box?

609
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,090
我以前是打中量级的
Well see I used to fight.

610
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,430
而且我打得很好
Middleweight. And I was pretty good.

611
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,390
他们大家都知道
They know it. Well anyway...

612
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,640
快点告诉我  我想听
Well come on tell me. I want to hear.

613
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,650
当时我跟一个叫
Well the thing is see...

614
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,360
迪西威尔斯的人练习
I used to work out with this guy Dixie Wells.

615
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,820
他是我的一位好朋友
He was a real good friend of mine.

616
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,110
他很喜欢拳击  外头的人都看好他
Loved to box. People on the outside had their eye on him.

617
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,330
他原本可以晋到最高级
He was gonna come out of the army and go right up to the top.

618
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:58,660
有天下午  我跟他在健身房练习对打
Well one afternoon he and I were sparring around in the gym

619
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,000
你知道  就是友善那种打法
you know kind of friendly-like

620
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,090
他可能是太累了
and he must have been set pretty flat on his feet

621
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,590
因为我不过是
because I caught him with a...

622
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,890
用普通力气打了他一记右拳
No more than ordinary right cross...

623
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,270
他没有爬起来  动也不动
And he didn't get up he didn't move.

624
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:24,360
他昏迷了一个礼拜  最后终于清醒了
He was in a coma for a week and finally he did pull out of it.

625
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,530
可是他却瞎了
Only the thing was that he was blind.

626
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,450
我到医院去看了他几次
Well I went to see him at the hospital a couple of times

627
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,290
后来我再也无法去看他
then finally I just couldn't go back.

628
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,710
最后一次当我们谈起拳击
The last time he and I started talking about fighting and...

629
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,090
他开始哭
He started to cry.

630
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,630
看着那双瞎了
And seeing tears coming out of those eyes

631
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,260
的眼睛流着泪
that couldn't see anything.

632
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,880
我应该告诉你  荷姆斯跟他的拳手谈过了
I thought I oughta tell you. Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.

633
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,130
从现在开始  不会对你客气
From now on it's no holds barred.

634
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:30,130
他们打算将你逼进禁闭室
They aim to run you right into the stockade if they got to.

635
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,130
任由他们
Let them.

636
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,640
我会帮你  可是我不能太过明显
I'll help you as much as I can but I can't get too far out on a limb.

637
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,970
我不会牺牲自己的军阶  我喜欢这个军团
I ain't risking losing my stripes. I like this outfit.

638
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,190
我也一样  真好笑  不是吗
So do I. That's funny ain't it?

639
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,900
是的  是很好笑
Yeah. Yeah that is funny.

640
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,820
保持一直线  普威特
Keep going' in a straight line Prewitt.

641
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,450
继续走
Keep going

642
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
好了  够了
All right that's enough.

643
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,890
普威特  把它埋了
Okay Prewitt bury it.

644
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,620
我顺利的星期一
My hitch was up Monday

645
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,080
不是个失败的士兵
Not a dog soldier no more

646
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,160
我不再是个士兵
I ain't a soldier no more

647
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,920
他们给了我所有的钱
They gave me all that money

648
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,050
多到我口袋很沉重
So much my pockets is sore

649
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,590
喔  我口袋很沉重
Oh my pockets is sore

650
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,630
耶  是个男生
Yeah that a boy

651
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,640
钱多到用不完
More dough than I can use

652
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,890
从军去
Reenlistment blues

653
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,230
唱
Sing it boys

654
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,200
时间到
Time

655
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:41,550
把这里清干净  普威特
Clean up the mess Prewitt

656
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,770
快  这是劳动  可不是在度假
Hurry it up You're on fatigue detail not a vacation

657
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,450
-快点  把它清干净  -你自己清
- Come on Clean it up - Clean it up yourself

658
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,160
什么
What?

659
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,580
要清你自己去清理
You heard me. Rub your own nose in it a while.

660
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,210
你不该跟无委任状士官顶嘴
Prewitt you know better than to talk back to a noncommissioned officer?

661
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,580
是的
Yes sir.

662
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,100
但我可不喜欢
But I've never liked being spit on sir

663
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,540
被无委任士官侮辱
not even by a noncommissioned officer.

664
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,880
你应该向他道歉
You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.

665
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,970
绝不  长官  是他该向我道歉
I don't think so sir. I think Sergeant Galovitch owes me an apology.

666
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,010
-帕路索下士  -是的  长官
- Corporal Peluso? - Yes sir?

667
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,050
让这个人全副武装
Have this man roll a full field pack extra shoes and helmet

668
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,310
带他去跑可洛可洛山路
take a bicycle and hike him up to Kolekole Pass

669
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,770
然后再带他来见我
and back then bring him to me.

670
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,730
-是的  长官  -好了  普威特  我们走
- Yes sir. - All right Prewitt let's go.

671
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,020
时间
Time

672
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,240
等一下
Hold it a minute.

673
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,060
抽根烟吧
Go ahead Prewitt and have a cigarette.

674
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,500
我跟你一样不喜欢这种事
I don't like this any more than you do.

675
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,000
谢谢
Thanks.

676
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:00,260
你预备好向  葛罗维奇士官道歉
I take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now?

677
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,010
不  长官  我不道歉
No sir I'm not.

678
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,640
帕路索  再带他去跑一圈
Peluso take him up there again.

679
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,020
是的  长官  好了  普威特  我们走
Yes sir. All right Prewitt let's go.

680
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,270
你不能善待这种人
You can't be decent to a man like that.

681
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,410
他好像是头野兽似的
You have to treat him like an animal.

682
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,830
上士  准备军法审判的表格
Sergeant prepare court-martial papers.

683
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,340
罪名是抗命
Insubordination to a noncommissioned officer.

684
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,840
是的  长官
Yes sir.

685
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,230
-只是太可惜了  -怎么了
- Only it's a shame. - What is?

686
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,180
你将会失去一名
Well I was just thinking sir It's too bad

687
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,520
中量级好手
you've gotta lose a good middleweight.

688
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,770
我不需要忍受他的无礼
I don't care. I don't have to stand for that kind of insolence.

689
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,320
不  长官  当然用不着
No sir you sure don't.

690
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,990
我马上准备表格
I'll prepare the papers then.

691
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,200
就算他只被判刑三个月
The only trouble is that even if he gets just three months

692
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,620
决赛时他会待在禁闭室中
he'll still be in the stockade when the boxing finals come up.

693
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,460
你有办法说服他吗
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

694
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,380
你可以加重惩罚  长官
Well you could double up on company punishment sir.

695
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,920
我会用重刑
All right. I'll throw the book at him.

696
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,130
如果你那么觉得的话  长官
Yes sir if you think that's the way to do it.

697
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,390
好建议  上士
Nice going Sarge.

698
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,450
继续看的话
Keep looking Mazzioli

699
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,270
你会发现自己在刷地板
you'll find yourself scrubbing this orderly room floor

700
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,420
借过  我和服务生们已经忙坏了
Coming through Watch it Me and my waiters are working our tails off.

701
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,550
烫  烫
Hot Hot H-So-T

702
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,810
你好吗  在这里比被关禁闭好
How you doing buddy boy? Better than being thrown in the stockade ain't it?

703
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,350
我好吗  我是个粗人
How am I doing Sarge? I'm a rough man man.

704
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,730
慢一点  汗别滴到菜上
Slow up a little there Angelo so you can stop sweating in the food.

705
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,770
不要阻止我  中士  不要阻止我
Don't hold me back Sarge. Don't hold me back.

706
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,110
我正在申请升下士  你成功不了的
I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow. Well you'll never make it.

707
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,320
-你好  中士  -你好  军士长
- Hiya Sarge. - Hiya Top.

708
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,460
一生都得待在步兵团里
Life in a rifle company.

709
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,260
你看起来很累的样子  小子
You look awful tired kid.

710
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,010
你喜欢连续当班吗
How do you like straight duty?

711
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,470
-你认为我会介意吗  -我没有那么说
- What makes you think I mind it Warden? - I didn't say you minded it.

712
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,850
我只是说你看来很累的样子  好像快崩溃似的
I just said you looked tired. You know drawn to a fine edge.

713
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,850
我喜欢这种生活  棒极了
Oh I like this life. It's a great life.

714
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,020
如果我找到珍珠  我会算你一份
If I find a pearl I'll cut you in.

715
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:04,070
跟你平分  知道吗
Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?

716
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,610
如果不是你让我来这里  我不会有机会去找它
If you didn't put me here I'd have no chance to find it right?

717
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:10,110
现在你有机会了  你知道什么
Now there's a man for you. What do you know?

718
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,240
既然你喜欢  我会再多替你找一些
Since you like it so much I'll see if I can find some more for you.

719
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,290
垃圾小队怎么样
How about garbage detail?

720
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,370
谢了  礼拜三已经做过了
Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.

721
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:21,040
原来做过了  那么扫街如何
So you did. What about street cleaning?

722
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,500
-昨天扫过了  -你的记忆力比我的更好
- Yesterday. - You got a better memory than me.

723
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,550
当然  如果你聪明的话
Of course if you were smart...

724
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,720
说得是  但我并不聪明
Yeah but I ain't smart.

725
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,010
但如果你聪明  你就用不着做炊事兵
I know but if you were you wouldn't have to pull K.P.

726
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,010
或者其他劳动工作
or any other fatigue duty for that matter.

727
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:39,060
如果你认为可以说服我打拳  那你就错了
If you think you can bribe me into boxing Warden you're wrong.

728
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,860
你错了  你没有办法  荷姆斯跟特训也办不到
You're wrong. Not you and Dynamite Holmes and the treatment.

729
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,120
你还要压迫普威特多久
How long are you guys gonna keep breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?

730
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,410
你已连续一个月罚他加班了
You've had him on that extra duty roster a month already.

731
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,410
-我不明白为什么你  -皮特你不行吗
- I can't see why you... - Can't you Pete?

732
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,160
年纪大心也变软了吗
What's the matter you getting soft in your old age?

733
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,250
或许我是在给他些教训
Maybe I want to teach the kid a lesson.

734
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,250
-或许是你喜欢这样  -或许我是喜欢
- Maybe you like it. - Maybe I do.

735
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,670
我不想再看你做荷姆斯的爪牙
I'm getting sick and tired watching you being a stooge for Holmes.

736
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,930
你不会再看多久了
Yeah well you ain't gonna see it much longer.

737
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,220
我自己也很厌烦
I'm getting sick and tired of it myself. I'm through Pete.

738
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,720
我随时都可以不干  真的
Any day now and I mean it

739
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,850
只要荷姆斯允许  我宁可明天就请调
Listen if Holmes would let me I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.

740
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,940
有半打以上的军团会争取我
There's half a dozen companies in this regiment that'd grab me.

741
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,310
-而且还会有官阶  -当然
- And in grade too. - Oh sure.

742
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,440
我还可以做参谋长
I could be chief of staff too only I just can't

743
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,480
但我不能离开我的弟兄
think of leaving my old buddies.

744
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,490
你要上哪儿去  应声虫
Where are you going Little Sir Echo?

745
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,700
去冲澡  除非士官长反对
To take my shower if the stinking First Sergeant has no objections.

746
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,700
你以为了呢  去看电影吗
Where'd you think? To the movies in this towel?

747
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,700
快点  我们去⒓副啤酒
Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

748
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,540
就算那是世上最后的啤酒也不去
I wouldn't drink with you if it was the last beer in the world.

749
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,210
我请客
I'm buying.

750
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,370
那就不一样了
That's different.

751
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,720
哇
Wow

752
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,150
萝丝
Rose.

753
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,150
知道为何我喜欢你为我服务
You know why I like to have you serve me beer?

754
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,740
这样我才能看着你走开
So's I can watch you when you walk away.

755
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:21,160
你有权抱怨
It's in regulations. You got a right to complain.

756
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,910
你可以去向督察长申诉
You got a right to take your case to the inspector general.

757
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,830
任何士兵都可以  就连普通二等兵都行
Any soldier has even a plain dogface.

758
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,290
不  我不会去申诉
No. I ain't gonna complain.

759
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,590
我不会让他们得到满足的
They ain't gonna get that satisfaction.

760
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,010
不管你信不信我有一大家人
Believe it or not this is one soldier that's got a real big family.

761
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,560
一共十五人  这里只有一半而已
Fifteen of them 'course this is only half of them.

762
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,060
你看到那个留八字胡的先生
You see the gentleman with the handlebars? That's Mr. Maggio.

763
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,690
那是我父亲  马吉欧先生
Mr. Maggio is my father.

764
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,230
从没见过如此顽固的人
Never saw anybody so stubborn.

765
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,530
离他们上次让你进城有多久了
How long is it since they let you go into town?

766
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,030
-六个星期  -搞不好会六年
- Six weeks. - It's liable to be six years.

767
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,530
六年你都看不到女人
How'd you like it six years before you see a dame?

768
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,660
你何不管好自己的事
Look why don't you just mind your own business huh?

769
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,580
你为什么不去学吹号角
And where did you learn to play the bugle?

770
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,330
那才是我的好兄弟
That's my buddy boy

771
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,590
这小妞是谁
Who's the broad?

772
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,180
是我姐姐
My sister.

773
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,770
马吉奥你在干嘛
Maggio what are you doing'?

774
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,650
-你打我  -没错  而且我会再打
- You hit me - Yeah and I'm about to do it again too.

775
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,990
-你这个肮脏的义大利佬  -想打就到外面解决
- Why you dirty Wop - If you want to fight take it outside

776
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,990
我要切下这义佬的心脏
I'm gonna cut this wop's heart out.

777
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,830
如果有人敢插手  我会先修理他
Anybody steps in here I give it to him first.

778
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,840
再往前一步  胖子  我就会砍了你的脑袋
One step further Fatso and I'm gonna de-brain you. I'll kill...

779
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,920
这里只有我才可以杀人
Nobody's gonna do nothing Anybody does any killing around here I'll do it

780
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,590
-这是私事  -不
- This is a private affair Warden. - No it ain't

781
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,590
他属于我的军团
This man's in my company

782
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,560
不要无缘无故的替我制造麻烦
You ain't making two extra weeks' paperwork for me for nothing.

783
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,140
非打不可吗
Out for blood huh?

784
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,230
搞不好会把胆汁都吐出来
You'd puke your guts out at the sight of a dead man.

785
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,940
把凳子放下  把它放下
Put down that stool. Put it down

786
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,530
把刀子扔掉
Drop that knife.

787
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:08,620
好吧  胖子  如果你想杀人就来吧
Okay Fatso if it's killing you want come on.

788
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,670
来吧
Well come on.

789
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,420
丢到地板上
On the floor

790
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,770
杀手  我宁可用你们  来交换一个女童军
Killers huh? I'd trade the pair of you for a good Camp Fire girl.

791

泼猴

792
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:50,580
你这种人迟早会被关禁闭
Guys like you end up in the stockade sooner or later.

793
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,710
总有一天我会等着你被关进来
Someday you'll walk in I'll be waiting.

794
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:55,710
到时我会要你好看
I'll show you a couple of things.

795
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,690
我要出去呼吸点空气

796
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,740
我很高兴他阻止了这件事
I'm glad he stopped it.

797
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,870
他是个好人
He's a good man.

798
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,970
你留着
You keep it.

799
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,020
留做纪念
Keep it for a souvenir.

800
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,520
好吧  我会留着
Okay I'll keep it.

801
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,690
你不太有机会享受生活吧  小子
You ain't enjoying life much are you kid?

802
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,530
普鲁伊特

803
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,080
你周末想放假吗
Could you stand a weekend pass?

804
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,660
可以吗
Could I...

805
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:17,920
荷姆斯怎么办
What about Holmes?

806
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,970
别担心
Don't worry about Holmes.

807
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,960
我放在他面前的文件  他都会签字
He signs anything I put in front of him without reading it.

808
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,380
我会用的到的
Sure could use it.

809
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,970
听说你迷恋上  新国会俱乐部一位小姐
I hear you gone dippy over some dame down at the New Congress Club.

810
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,350
-她叫什么名字  -萝琳
- What'd you say her name was? - Lorene.

811
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,480
好美的名字
Beautiful name.

812
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,120
嗨  老兄
Hey paisan

813
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,290
是什么绊住你了  我们走
What's holding you up? Let's get going?

814
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,500
怎么了  你不喜欢这里吗
What's the matter buddy boy? Don't you like it here?

815
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,920
你难道有更好的去处
You got something better to do in town?

816
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,750
巴士就快开了  我要赶去搭车
Look the bus is leaving right away. I'm taking the bus right?

817
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,010
快走  我是有钱人  我会搭计程车
Take off. You're talking to a rich man. I'll hop a taxi.

818
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,090
我到卡拉库瓦跟你碰面
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua later.

819
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,100
马吉欧  预备上哨
Maggio get ready for guard.

820
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,440
戴宽边毡帐  子弹腰带  武器

821
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,440
十分钟内报到
Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.

822
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,240
什么  我有假单
What? I got a pass

823
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,950
那不算  安德生病了  所以你得上哨
Not anymore. Anderson's sick. You're on guard.

824
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,200
我昨天上过哨  为什么是我
I just had guard yesterday. Why me?

825
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,950
我告诉你原因  你换衣服速度应该快一点
I'll tell you why you. You should've gotten dressed faster.

826
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,550
你在回避我吗
I sure never figured in your giving me the runaround.

827
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,090
他们甚至不让我进来
They didn't even want to let me in this place.

828
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,550
我们被围攻那就是为什么
We're mobbed that's why.

829
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,220
这里有一大群希坎军营来的人
There's a big crowd from Hickam Field and they got in here first.

830
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,220
你到底想怎么样
Anyway what'd you expect a brass band to meet you?

831
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,720
-我以为你会想见我  -我正在忙  看到了吗
- No. I did think you'd want to see me. - I'm busy can't you see?

832
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:01,190
-是的  我看到了  -我是在忙
- Yes I can see. It's crowded. - Well I am.

833
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,480
马吉欧待会儿会去卡拉库瓦
Look Maggio's gonna be at the Kalakaua Inn later.

834
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,530
难道你不能想办法离开吗
Ain't there no way you can get out of here?

835
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,820
你到底怎么搞的
What's the matter with you?

836
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,990
我在这里工作  你不懂吗
I work here you know after all. Can't you understand?

837
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:20,330
是的  我当然明白  我非常明白
Yes I do. I understand I understand very well.

838
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,850
你几个礼拜都没有来
You haven't been around here in weeks

839
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:24,920
现在突然出现
and now you turn up all of a sudden and...

840
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,710
小心  老兄  走路要看路
Watch it Mack Watch where you're going

841
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,710
我们到外面去
Come on out of here.

842
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,810
奇佛太太有规定  我不能这样就走掉了
Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules? I can't just walk out.

843
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,400
我们不能在外面跟男孩约会
And even if I could she doesn't like us to see the boys on the outside.

844
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,770
如果你是这种感觉那就算了
Look if you feel that way just forget about it okay?

845
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,820
你管不着我
You haven't any claims on me Mister.

846
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,650
-你又不是我丈夫  -原来你在这里  萝琳
- You're not my husband you know. - There you are Lorene.

847
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,740
我欣赏你的品味但我们需要她
I vastly admire your taste my dear but we really need Lorene now.

848
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,580
有许多位先生没有人陪伴  真是忙坏了
So many of the gentlemen are unattended. It is such a rush isn't it?

849
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,580
-是啊  -搞不好有人会误解
- Yeah. - One might almost mistake us...

850
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,210
我们在开大型政治会议
For one of those big political conventions in Philadelphia.

851
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:06,040
-你来吧  萝琳  -马上来
- You are coming Lorene? - In a minute.

852
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,960
-对不起  -你认为我有什么感觉
- I'm sorry. - How do you think I feel?

853
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:15,220
搞不好我几个月都无法拿到假条
I may not get another pass for months.

854
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,430
我期待这次见面  就像小孩期待耶诞节一样
I've been counting on this like a kid counts on Christmas.

855
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,340
还是算了吧  萝琳在忙
But forget it. Forget it. Lorene's busy.

856
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,440
萝琳很抱歉
Lorene has got work to do. Lorene's sorry.

857
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,520
别再叫我萝琳  我的本名叫艾玛
Oh stop calling me Lorene My name's Alma

858
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,560
-艾玛  -是的  艾玛伯克
- Alma? - Yes Alma Burke

859
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,070
艾玛
Alma?

860
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,700
奇佛太太从香水广告上  挑了萝琳这个名字
Mrs. Kipfer picked "Lorene" out of a perfume ad.

861
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,200
她觉得这个名字很有法国风味
She thought it sounded French.

862
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,220
你怎么脱身的
Hey how'd you get away?

863
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,310
我说我病了
I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.

864
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,980
-但我打赌她并不相信  -我赌她不信
- But I bet she doesn't believe it. - I bet she doesn't.

865
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,190
-你想⑹裁  -可乐  谢谢
- What'll you have? - A coke please.

866
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,650
给她可乐  大可乐
Yeah give her a Coke. Big Coke.

867
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,320
你能来这里见我真好
It's great you meeting me here you know?

868
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,530
我是运气好才能进城
See I'm just lucky getting in town.

869
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:19,910
-军士长饶了我  -他们还在施压吗
- Topkick gave me a break. - They still pouring it on?

870
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,790
他们真的让我快要崩溃
Holmes and those others they really got me on the edge.

871
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:26,370
-你一定很恨军队  -不  我不恨它
- Gee you must hate the army. - No I don't hate the army.

872
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,370
但把你折磨成这样
But look what it's doing to you.

873
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,540
我爱军队
I love the army.

874
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,880
但它一定不爱你
But it sure doesn't love you.

875
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:38,720
男人爱一样东西  并不表示一定有所回报
A man loves a thing that don't mean it's gotta love him back.

876
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,850
没错  但人的忍耐有限
Yeah but a person can stand just so much.

877
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,930
你爱某件事  你应该感恩
You love a thing you've got to be grateful.

878
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,890
我在十七岁时离家
See I left home when I was 17.

879
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,270
我的父母亲都死了
Both my folks is dead

880
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:54,020
我没有归属感直到入伍为止
and I didn't belong no place till I entered the army.

881
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,690
而且我还学会吹号角
If it weren't for the army I wouldn't have learned how to bugle.

882
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,570
-吹号角  -是的
- To bugle? - Yeah.

883
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,830
这个吹口就是我在  阿灵顿公墓吹丧葬号时用的
That's the mouthpiece that I used when I played a Taps at Arlington.

884
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:08,830
他们选我在休战纪念日  吹奏丧葬号角
They picked me to play a Taps at Arlington cemetery on Armistice Day.

885
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,920
总统也到场
The president was there.

886
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,170
我的号角吹得很好
I play the bugle well.

887
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,130
嗨  老百姓
Hello citizens

888
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,430
-你上哪儿去了  -你好  帕尔斯
- Hey where you been? - Hi pals.

889
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:25,220
我已经去过三家酒吧  我对三家酒吧都做了些奉献
I've been in three bars and I put a dent in all three of them.

890
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:28,480
-没错  看来就像  -给我些酒  我很想要
- Yeah you look it. - Give me a nail Prew. I'm hungry for a nail.

891
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,560
你怎么会穿制服
What you doing in uniform?

892
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,690
我正考虑从军
I'm thinking of joining the army.

893
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:36,780
或许我该到墨西哥当牛仔
Or maybe I'll go to Mexico and become a cowboy.

894
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,400
你愿意跟我一起去吗
You want to go with me?

895
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:42,110
你再继续喝酒就会像溶掉的蜡烛一样游泳
You keep on drinking you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

896
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:46,200
你说得很对  酒保  威士忌
You're absolutely right. Bartender whiskey

897
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,830
大杯的
Large whiskey.

898
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:52,210
借过  老兄
Excuse me. Hey buddy.

899
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,080
山姆
Sam

900
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:58,960
各位  金贝地下室的怪物  就要出笼了
Hey coming out fellas. The terror of Gimbel's basement.

901
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:02,590
让开  出个七点  五点  两点
Stand back there now. Here we go. A seven for daddy. Five deuce.

902
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,430
七点
Hey seven.

903
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:09,480
两个么点  那正是我一生的高潮
Snake eyes. That's the story of my life.

904
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,230
夏威夷皇家饭店就在附近
Hey Prew that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotel around the corner.

905
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,320
电影明星常在那里出现
That's where all those movie stars stay.

906
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,360
你最好安静下来
Listen paisan you'd better simmer down.

907
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,320
你还有整个周末要过
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

908
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:26,740
那是你说的  兄弟
- That's what you say buddy. - What do you mean?

909
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:29,500
-他们只给你过夜假条吗  -没有假条
- They only gave you an overnight pass? - No pass.

910
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,830
他们让我上哨  可是老安杰罗骗过他们了
No pass at all. They put me on guard duty but old Angelo he foxed them.

911
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,960
你擅离岗哨
You walked off guard?

912
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,340
我签到之后立刻签出
I checked in and I checked right out again.

913
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,350
你赶快回到岗哨去
You get your tail right back to the post.

914
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,510
你的麻烦大了
You're in trouble. You know that.

915
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:44,180
我有个好主意
Hey hey Prew Prew I got a good idea.

916
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,510
我们去跟电影明星游泳
Let's go swimming We'll go swimming with a movie star.

917
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,890
我正打算那么做  去跟电影明星游泳
That's what I'm gonna do go swim with a movie star

918
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,020
听着安吉洛
Listen Angelo...

919
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,430
二十尺高  我要去跟电影明星游泳
Twenty feet tall I'm going swimming with a movie star.

920
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,440
你最好快走吧
You'd better go.

921
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,240
嘿  安吉洛
Hey Angelo.

922
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,830
混球  快走来  醒醒
Jerk get up. Wake up.

923
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,290
我是清醒的  你干嘛大吼
I'm awake I'm awake. What are you hollering?

924
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,380
把衣服穿上
Yeah you're awake. Put your clothes on all right?

925
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:23,010
把它们送给印第安人  他们会需要的
Give them back to the Indians. The Indians need the clothes.

926
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,390
他们只穿丁字裤
All they wear is G-strings.

927
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,720
你没有⒆  快起来
You ain't drunk. Come on get up.

928
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:35,390
我要在这里等电影明星  从饭店里出来
Hey I am waiting here for a movie star to come out of the hotel

929
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,980
除非她出现否则我不会走
and I am not going until she shows up.

930
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,270
把衣服穿上
Put your clothes on.

931
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,490
在我们惹上麻烦之前赶快离开
Let's get out of here before we get in trouble okay?

932
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:48,410
你是怎么回事  难道我不能⒆砺
What's the matter with you? Can't a man get drunk?

933
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,950
难道我不能做自己想做的事
Can't a man do nothing?

934
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:56,870
难道我不能手插在口袋里  走在大街上吗
Can't he put his lousy hands in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

935
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,750
难道我必须一生被追逐吗
A man gotta be hounded all his life?

936
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,710
我累了  我又不是罪犯
Well I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

937
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,800
-我也不是懦夫  -兄弟  你瞧
- I ain't no coward - Buddy boy look.

938
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:10,220
你把衣服穿好  快把衣服穿上
You get dressed you put your clothes on.

939
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,770
-等我  我去叫计程车  -是才怪
- Will you wait for me? I'll get a cab. - Yeah yeah sure.

940
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,480
-你会等吧  -是的  你去叫计程车
- Will you wait? - Yeah you get a cab.

941
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:35,000
嗨  宪兵你们快来抓我
Hey M.P.s Come and get me you guys

942
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,080
我在这里
Here I am

943
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,800
你们只能这样吗  我想你们一定是吃脆麦片的
Is that the best you can do? I bet you guys eat Wheaties

944
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,560
军事法庭有消息吗
Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?

945
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,810
-现在正在审  -他一定会被关禁闭
- It's on right now. - He'll get the stockade sure.

946
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,730
或许他不会被关
Maybe he won't get it.

947
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,740
他只不过是⒆砹
All he did was to get drunk.

948
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,870
那是军人的本色  偶尔变成义务了
It's a soldier's nature. It's almost his sacred duty once in a while.

949
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,950
可是他擅离职守
But he walked off guard. He went A.W.O.L.

950
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,620
-你为什么在这里  -男子汉不能休息吗
- What're you hanging around here for? - Can't a man rest?

951
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,710
什么男子汉  你没事做吗  我可以派一些给你
What man? You got no work? Maybe I can scare you up some.

952
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,720
去打几杆撞球  有任何消息我会通知你
Go on and shoot some pool. Any word comes through I'll let you know.

953
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,230
参谋本部  华登上士  是的  长官
Company First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes sir.

954
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,480
我会把他的东西准备好
Yes sir I'll have his things in order.

955
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,410
他被判刑了  六个月
He got it. Six months.

956
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,380
金贝的地下室关不了我
I'm gonna escape from this dump.

957
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,960
禁闭室也一样关不住
Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me neither can no lousy stockade.

958
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,420
-闭嘴  -全听你的  女童军
- Shut up. - Whatever you say Brownie.

959
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,800
囚犯  停
Prisoner halt

960
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,910
你好  泼猴
Hello tough monkey.

961
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,260
我们很幸运能租到它
This other girl and I were lucky to rent it.

962
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,470
这是个迎合潮流的好区
This is a very fashionable district.

963
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,300
我替你打了钥匙
I have another key made for you.

964
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:59,640
你随时都可以用它  就算我不在也可以
You can use it any time you want to even when I'm not here.

965
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,690
-嗨  -嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

966
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:13,490
普威特就是我跟你提起的大兵
This is Prew the soldier I told you about.

967
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,450
-乔琪特  我的室友  -欢迎你  朋友
- This is Georgette my roommate. - Well welcome friend.

968
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:19,160
自从那只猫死了以后  屋里就没有男的了
There hasn't been a man around the house since the cat died.

969
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,250
我每次必订阅书会的书
I belong to the Book Guild Club. I always take every book.

970
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,210
那是我分得红利的方式
That's the way I get all the dividends.

971
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:30,630
等马吉欧出禁闭室后  她会很适合他
She'll be great for your friend Maggio when he gets out of the stockade.

972
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:33,050
是的  他会为她疯狂
Yes he'll be crazy about her.

973
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,680
请坐  让自己舒服一下
Just sit down and get comfortable.

974
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,680
我去替你调杯马丁尼  再去准备晚饭
I'll make you a martini and see what's to cook for dinner.

975
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:45,480
感觉好像结了婚  对吧
Hey this is like being married ain't it?

976
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,560
好比结了婚
It's better.

977
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,250
你还好吗
You Okay?

978
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:32,650
很高兴你来了吗
Glad you came?

979
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:04,970
我们走吧  不要回头
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

980
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,890
我们不能再这样继续下去
It can't go on like this much longer.

981
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,100
就算是到了岛这一头  我们还是得
Even when we sneaked clear across the island tonight

982
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,440
像囚犯一样逃跑
we had to run out like jailbirds.

983
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,690
如果我们有办法
If there was only some way we...

984
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,490
荷姆斯会让你离婚
Holmes would probably give you a divorce

985
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,030
可是他不会让我请调
but he'd never let me transfer out of his outfit.

986
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,990
是有一个办法
There is a way.

987
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:13,210
我一直在考虑这件事  你必须去做军官
I've been thinking about it. You've got to become an officer.

988
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,460
就读新的额外课程
You can take the new extension course the one they passed last May.

989
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,630
然后他们就会送你回美国
When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States.

990
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,630
当军官
An officer?

991
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,640
是的  这样我可以跟  唐纳离婚再嫁给你
Yes. Then I could divorce Dana and marry you.

992
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,350
我讨厌军官  我一直很讨厌军官
I hate officers I've always hated officers

993
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,770
那可是个很明智的看法
Well that's a fine intelligent point of view.

994
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:34,380
如果我说我讨厌上士呢
Suppose I said I always hated sergeants?

995
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,650
这样合理多了
That'd make a lot of sense wouldn't it?

996
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,400
你已经研究得很透澈
You sure made a complete study of it.

997
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,950
好吧  假设我是研究过  别以为这事很容易
Okay suppose I did it. And don't think it's a cinch.

998
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,370
我在美国时你就可以离婚了
Then you'd be getting your divorce here while I was in the States.

999
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:49,660
我们必须分开六个月  到时我们一定会参战
We'd be apart maybe six months. We're sure to be into a war by then.

1000
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,660
老实说吧
Why don't you tell the truth?

1001
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,830
你只是不想负责任
You just don't want the responsibility.

1002
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,830
搞不好你根本不爱我
You're probably not even in love with me.

1003
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,920
你疯了  真希望我不爱你
You're crazy I wish I didn't love you

1004
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,590
或许我可以再次享受人生
Maybe I could enjoy life again.

1005
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:10,680
于是他们结了婚  从此过着不快乐的生活
So they were married and lived unhappily ever after.

1006
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:16,350
在我遇见你之前  我从不曾如此悲惨
I've never been so miserable in my life as I have since I met you.

1007
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,860
我也没有
Neither have I.

1008
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,280
我不愿再抛弃一分钟
I wouldn't trade a minute of it.

1009
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,820
我也不愿意
Neither would I.

1010
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:28,780
或许我会成为  你见过最差的军官
I'll probably make the lousiest officer in this man's army you ever saw.

1011
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:31,950
你一定会是个好军官
You'll make a fine officer.

1012
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:35,120
一个很棒的军官
A remarkable officer.

1013
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,300
谢谢你
Thank you.

1014
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,050
过来
Come here.

1015
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,810
难道你不能等我们吃完晚餐
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

1016
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,400
-亲爱的  -什么事
- Honey? - What?

1017
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,270
我想娶你
I want to marry you.

1018
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,320
你真是个好玩的家伙
You're a funny one.

1019
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,240
为什么有人想娶你  是件好玩的事
Why? Why is it funny if a guy wants to marry you?

1020
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:10,910
因为你是在  新国会俱乐部认识我
Because I'm a girl you met at the New Congress Club.

1021
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:13,410
那只不过比最底层高一点而已
That's about two steps up from the pavement.

1022
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,580
我是什么  不过是个大兵  没有阶级的大兵
Well what am I? I'm a private no-class dogface.

1023
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:21,000
大部分的人会认为我什么都不是
The way most civilians look at that that's two steps up from nothing.

1024
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,470
我以为我们很快乐
Prew I thought we were happy.

1025
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,470
你为何要毁了这一切
Why do you want to spoil things?

1026
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,680
听着  我还有一年就要延役
Look I've got a year to go before I reenlist.

1027
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,130
如果到时候我能升为士官
If I can swing sergeant's stripes by

1028
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,730
我就可以回美国
then they'll let me go back to the States.

1029
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:38,770
到时我们可以一起回去  如果你愿意等的话
Then you and I can go back there together if you'll wait.

1030
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,190
你在荷姆斯手下如何升成士官
How do you expect to become a sergeant under that Captain Holmes of yours?

1031
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,190
你只能尽量不被关禁闭
It's all you can do to keep out of the stockade.

1032
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,360
我愿意打拳击
I'll fight.

1033
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:52,120
-不  你用不着打拳击  -那是值得的
- No you're not gonna fight. - It'd be worth it.

1034
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:00,920
现在我们彼此是相爱
Prew it's true we love each other now

1035
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,250
我们相互需要
we need each other

1036
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,090
但回到美国  就可能大不相同
but back in the States it might be different.

1037
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,090
那不是真正的理由
That ain't the real reason.

1038
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:15,890
-好吧  那不是  -什么是真正理由
- All right it's not. - What is the real reason?

1039
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:23,060
我不想成为士兵的太太
I won't marry you because I don't want to be the wife of a soldier.

1040
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,740
我最好只能为你做到那样
Well that would be about the best I could ever do for you.

1041
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:39,460
因为没有人能妨碍我的计划  没有任何人或任何事
Because nobody's gonna stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.

1042
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,500
因为我想做高尚人
Because I want to be proper.

1043
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,380
-高尚  -是的  高尚
- Proper? - Yes proper.

1044
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,210
再过一年  我的钱就存够了
In another year I'll have enough money saved

1045
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,430
我打算回到奥勒冈
and then I'm gonna go back to my hometown in Oregon

1046
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,350
替我妈和自己盖楝房子
and I'm gonna build a house for my mother and myself

1047
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:56,140
然后加入乡村俱乐部  学打高尔夫球
and join the country club and take up golf.

1048
01:15:56,930 --> 01:16:00,390
我会遇到有高尚地位的高尚男士
And I'll meet the proper man with the proper position

1049
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:04,650
我将成为高尚的太太  掌高尚的家
and make a proper wife who can run a proper home

1050
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,940
生养高尚的孩子
and raise proper children.

1051
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:10,530
我会很快乐  因为高尚的人很安全
And I'll be happy because when you're proper you're safe.

1052
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,740
你很有勇气  亲爱的
You got guts honey.

1053
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,790
我希望你能成功
I hope you can pull it off.

1054
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,460
当我说需要你时是真心的
I do mean it when I say I need you

1055
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,720
因为我很寂寞
because I'm lonely.

1056
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,840
你认为我在说谎  对吧
You think I'm lying don't you?

1057
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,470
没有人会用寂寞来说谎话
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

1058
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:49,480
不要跟我提离婚的事
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

1059
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:53,990
为什么  难道丑闻会  破坏你升迁的机会
Why? Because the scandal would spoil your chances for a promotion?

1060
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,490
我要知道对方是谁
I ask you once more.

1061
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,370
以及你是在哪里认识他的
I want to know who he is and where you met him.

1062
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,990
我绝对不会告诉你
I'm not going to tell you.

1063
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,400
我知道他是个老百姓
One thing I know. I know he's a civilian.

1064
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,790
你谨慎的不会找军人
You'd be too discreet to pick an army man.

1065
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,170
我不知道是你的骄傲  还是你的好奇让我重伤
I wonder which is hurt more your pride or your curiosity?

1066
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,340
你不会知道我的感受
You can't expect to know how I feel about a thing like this.

1067
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,180
为什么男人的感觉如此不同
I wonder why men feel so differently about it than women.

1068
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,800
根本完全不一样
It's just not the same.

1069
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,690
今天天气真好  我想去散个步
It's a lovely day. I think I'll go for a walk.

1070
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:28,860
嘿
Hey.

1071
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:35,280
我听说你才关完禁闭出来
I hear you just got out of the stockade.

1072
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,410
那里真的很难捱  我不想再多说
It was rugged. I kept my mouth shut and I didn't get in no trouble.

1073
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:40,370
你有见到马吉欧吗
Did you see Maggio?

1074
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,620
胖子把马吉欧折磨得很惨
Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.

1075
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,830
他甚至用了警棍
He's using a billy too.

1076
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:48,630
专打看不到的地方  比如说背后或胸前
Places where it won't show in the back in the chest.

1077
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,710
他甚至有个系统
He's got it down to a system.

1078
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,380
他还经常踢他
He kicks him a lot too.

1079
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,720
你知道马吉欧的反应如何
You know how Maggio's taking it?

1080
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:59,680
他一直对胖子吐口水
He just keeps spitting in Fatso's eye.

1081
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,720
他真有个性  是吗
Ain't he a hot one?

1082
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,640
他是一个好人
He's a good man.

1083
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,770
老胖子伤不了他
Well Fatso can't make a dent in him.

1084
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,980
那个胖子是个聪明人
But that Fatso he's smart.

1085
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:13,110
值星官从来看不到什么的
He makes sure the O.D. never sees nothing.

1086
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,240
为什么马吉欧不向值星官报告
Why doesn't Maggio go to the O.D. himself?

1087
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,740
我们曾鼓励他去报告但他不肯
We tried to get him to but he won't peep.

1088
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,990
他真的很倔强
That boy's about the toughest nut in the woods.

1089
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:22,330
你认为他能平安吗
You think he's gonna be all right huh?

1090
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,960
-他可能快崩溃了  -这话什么意思
- Well maybe he's cracking at that. - What do you mean?

1091
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,710
胖子将他关进洞裹  就是  单人牢房后
After Fatso threw him in the hole that's solitary

1092
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:33,460
他开始不停地说他要如何逃跑
he started talking a couple of times about how he's gonna escape.

1093
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,970
他说他某个晚上会来找你
He said to tell you he'll look you up one of these nights.

1094
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,720
你还趴在地上吗  普威特
Still on your knees huh Prewitt?

1095
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,430
拳击决赛在下个月  十二月十五日
Well boxing finals next month. December 15th.

1096
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,100
你还有时闲帮我们赢得冠军
You've still got time to help us win the championship.

1097
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:52,110
你是否以加入本军团为荣
Are you proud to be in this company or not?

1098
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,700
我不会再绕过你了
I ain't gonna move around you again.

1099
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,700
看来你需要点教训
Something tells me you need a lesson Prewitt.

1100
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:07,790
或许我会亲自教训你
Maybe I'll give it to you myself.

1101
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,380
别惹他  他是我小队上的人
Come on leave him alone Ike. He's in my detail now.

1102
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,590
如果你打架  麻烦可就大了
You're gonna get in trouble if you fight around here.

1103
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:18,970
-回去工作  -别档路
- Get back to work Prew. - Get out of the way

1104
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,620
我很乐意提供推荐信
I'll be glad to put my recommendation on that Warden.

1105
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,790
你有功绩  经验和官阶
You've got service experience grade.

1106
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,420
-你一定会成为好军官  -谢谢你  长官
- You'll make an excellent officer. - Thank you sir.

1107
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,170
军团里能有你这种人  也是值得让我骄傲的事
It'd be a feather in my cap too. A man from my company.

1108
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,850
出了什么事
At ease. What's the trouble Sergeant?

1109
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:07,270
葛罗维奇和普威特  他们在外头打架  长官
They're fighting outside sir. Galovitch and Prewitt.

1110
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,470
普威特
Prewitt?

1111
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,020
葛罗维奇会杀了他  长官
Galovitch looks like he's gonna murder him sir.

1112
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,230
我会处理
I'll take care of it.

1113
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,030
-难道你不想看吗  -不想  你也别看  出去
- Don't you want to see? - No Nor you either Get out of here

1114
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,040
为什么普威特不打他的头
Why don't Prew go for his head?

1115
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,630
他曾打瞎某个人所以很害怕
He blinded a guy once. Must be scared of the same thing.

1116
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:43,970
揍他的脸
The face Prew Hit him in the face

1117
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:06,570
拜托  葛罗维奇  公平竞赛
- Come on Galovitch fight fair - I'll fight any way I want

1118
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:10,240
我想怎么打都行
Come on Prew Get him

1119
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:45,530
那位军官应该阻止这场架
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

1120
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,120
-他叫什么名字  -荷姆斯上尉  长官
- What's his name Major? - Captain Holmes sir.

1121
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:17,270
立正
Ten-hut

1122
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,440
稍息  是谁先动手的
At ease. What started this?

1123
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,570
普威特违抗我给他的命令  开始顶嘴并且挑衅
Prewitt refused order I gave him talked back and started a fight.

1124
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:25,570
所以我才会教训他
I taught him a lesson.

1125
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:28,030
你不可以再抗命
You won't disobey any more orders in my company Prewitt.

1126
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,110
长官  这件事不能怪普威特
Sir I'm sorry sir but Private Prewitt's not

1127
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:33,080
是葛罗维奇上士起头的
to blame Sergeant Galovitch started it.

1128
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,540
-索希尔  -是的  长官
- Thornhill. - Yes sir.

1129
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,620
这个小队是你带的  到底怎么回事
You're in charge of this detail. What about it?

1130
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:38,620
他说得对  普威特没有犯错
He's right sir. Prewitt done nothing.

1131
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:41,000
是葛罗维奇起的头
Yes sir. Galovitch started it.

1132
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,470
够了  这事算了  回去做自己的工作
That's all. Let's forget it. Let's get back to our jobs.

1133
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,550
好了  回去工作  动作快  解散
All right back to work. Let's go. Break it up.

1134
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,270
如果你认为这样我就会出赛  你就错了
If you guys think this means I'm stepping into a ring you're wrong.

1135
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:58,900
你的伤口最好擦点碘酒
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

1136
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,290
星期二带钱到镇上

普威特  你要去哪里
Hey Prewitt where you going?

我一定得称赞你

1180
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,800
揍葛罗维奇的方法  小子

1181
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,800
可惜他们迟早会扳倒你
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

1182
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,610
生命就是这么烂  你知道吗
Life's crummy you know it?

1183
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:34,190
是的  长官  是很悲惨  非常的悲惨
Yes sir it's miserable. Perfectly miserable.

1184
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:36,950
如果现在有车两卡车
What do you suppose would happen

1185
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,950
开过来撞上我们怎么办
if a truck was to come along and run us over?

1186
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,790
-我们就死定了  -你最好别再坐在这里
- We'd be dead. - You'd better not sit here anymore.

1187
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:47,370
起来坐到路旁去
You'd better get up and sit over on the side of the road.

1188
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:50,170
你在说什么  我  可是
What? What do you mean I better?

1189
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,650
你比我更需要活下去
You've got more to live for than I do.

1190
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,630
你还得照顾整个军团
You got your whole company to take care of.

1191
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,720
你快移到路旁
You move over move over to the other side of the road.

1192
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,760
我年纪比较大  死了没关系
- Go on. - I'm older It don't matter if I die.

1193
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,010
但你有你的一生  现在别争了
But you got your whole life ahead of you. Now don't argue.

1194
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,310
-快点起来-不  长官  普威特不去
- Go on get up. - No sir not Prewitt.

1195
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:07,520
普威特决定待到苦果的最后
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

1196
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:13,270
好吧  我们一起留在这里
Okay we'll stay together.

1197
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,780
反正我也站不起来
I don't... I couldn't have got up anyway.

1198
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:27,120
我惹了世界上最大的麻烦
I got the biggest troubles in the whole world.

1199
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:30,290
世界级的吗
In the whole world huh?

1200
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,210
都是因为爱
Take love.

1201
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:35,710
你曾经见过爱情吗
Did you personally ever see any of this love?

1202
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:38,630
你不明白我的意思
You'll understand what I mean.

1203
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,090
这个女孩
This girl see

1204
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,890
她要求我成为
she wants me to become...

1205
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:46,560
-成为什么  －一名军官
- Become what? - An officer.

1206
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:49,020
你能想像我当军官的样子吗
Can you see me as an officer?

1207
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,650
可以  我能想像你当军官
Yeah. Yeah I can see you as an officer.

1208
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:55,270
你一定会是个好军官
You'd be a good officer.

1209
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,400
你们两个比我有远见
Well you both can see more than I can see.

1210
01:27:57,490 --> 01:28:00,700
我不想当军官  我很喜欢现在这样
I don't wanna be an officer. I'm happy where I am.

1211
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:05,580
搞不好我会变成荷姆斯那种人
I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

1212
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:09,330
你不希望我跟荷姆斯一样吧
You wouldn't want me to be a guy like Holmes would you?

1213
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:12,460
你会吗
Well would you?

1214
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,420
男人应该做自己在行的事
A man should be what he can do.

1215
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:29,810
你的女朋友呢
How's your girl?

1216
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,730
再告诉我一次她的芳名
What's her name again?

1217
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:37,650
-萝琳  -对了  就是萝琳
- Lorene. - Oh yeah Lorene.

1218
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:39,820
我现在想起来了
I remember now.

1219
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,570
好美的名字
A beautiful name.

1220
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:44,820
美极了
Beautiful.

1221
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,830
你们两个愚蠢的疯家伙
You two dumb crazy screwballs

1222
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,040
你们想找死吗
What are you trying to do get yourself killed?

1223
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:57,040
你们在这里做什么
What are you doing in the middle of the road?

1224
01:28:57,130 --> 01:29:00,510
我的朋友普威特跟我  坐在这里讨论天气
My friend Prew and I sitting here discussing the weather.

1225
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,720
你的朋友
- Your friend huh? - You heard me.

1226
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,470
你得好好照顾这个人
Don't you know you gotta take care of this man?

1227
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:08,850
荷姆斯迟早会整倒他
Holmes is bound to get him sooner or later.

1228
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:11,600
他是陆军最棒的士兵
And he's the best stinking' soldier in the whole army.

1229
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,890
你们两个都晕头了
You both got rocks in your head.

1230
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:20,440
安杰罗  安杰罗
Angelo Angelo.

1231
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:27,070
我就知道你一定在裘伊酒吧
I figured you'd be here at Choy's.

1232
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:31,910
我办到了  普威特  正如我所说的  我逃出来了
I done it Prew. I escaped just like I said.

1233
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,960
跟我所计划的一样
Just like I figured.

1234
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,130
跳上了卡车  躲在防水布下面
In the back of a truck under a tarp.

1235
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:41,260
跟我所计划的一样  他们开车把我也载了出来
They rode me right out just like I figured.

1236
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,090
可惜离这儿一哩后  后档泥板  就掉了
Only the tailgate opened up Prew about a mile back

1237
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,430
所以我跌到路上
and I fell out in the road.

1238
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:53,060
你应该看我弹跳的样子  我应该有骨折才对
You should've seen me bounce. I must've broke something.

1239
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:59,820
普威特  听我说
Prew. Prew listen.

1240
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,400
胖子做的  普威特
Fatso done it Prew.

1241
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:05,910
他很喜欢修理我
He likes to whack me in the gut.

1242
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:10,700
一如往常  他问我会不会痛  然后我直接对着他吐口水
He asks me if it hurts and I spit at him like always.

1243
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:14,410
只是昨天  情况很糟
Only yesterday it was bad.

1244
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:18,330
他不断地打我
He hit me he hit me he hit me.

1245
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:23,300
我一定要出来  普威特  我一定要出来
I had to get out Prew. I had to get out.

1246
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,670
好家伙
Buddy buddy.

1247
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,590
他们会送你回禁闭室
They gonna send you to the stockade Prew?

1248
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,390
不  他们不会
No they ain't gonna send me to the stockade.

1249
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:33,140
小心胖子  要小心胖子
Watch out for Fatso.

1250
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,230
他想要修理你
He'll try to crack you.

1251
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:38,940
如果他们把你关进单人牢里  千万别大叫
And if they put you in the hole don't yell.

1252
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,230
不要出声
Don't make a sound.

1253
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:45,150
否则当他们把你拉出来时  你还是在叫
You'll still be yelling when they come to take you out.

1254
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,360
你只管躺在那里
Just lay there.

1255
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:52,370
安安静静地躺在那里  普威特
Just lay there and be quiet Prew.

1256
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,840
他死了
He's dead.

1257
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,250
我打赌那一定是普威特
I'll betcha that's Prewitt.

1258
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:05,640
贾德森上士
Sergeant Judson?

1259
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:07,690
你找我吗
You want me?

1260
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:09,860
是的  胖子
Yeah Fatso.

1261
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,440
我不喜欢那个外号
I don't like that nickname.

1262
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:15,200
你找我有什么事吗
You want to see me about something?

1263
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,160
我们找个角落好好谈谈
Let's step around the corner where we can talk.

1264
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,870
好的
Okay.

1265
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:33,500
你在生气什么吗
Are you sore about something?

1266
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,800
我不喜欢你弹琴的方式
I don't like the way you play the piano.

1267
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,390
-还记得马吉欧吗  -义大利佬
- Remember Maggio? - Oh the wop?

1268
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:43,470
记得  那个泼猴
Yeah a real tough monkey.

1269
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,930
-你杀了他  -我有吗
- You killed him. - Did I?

1270
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,940
如果我有  也是他咎由自取
Well if I did he asked for it.

1271
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:51,110
军队迟早会惩罚你
The army's gonna get you sooner or later Fatso.

1272
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:54,940
可是在他们动手之前  我想先找你算算帐
But before they do I want a piece of you myself.

1273
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,990
我早知道了
I figured that.

1274
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:00,990
看到这把刀了吗
See this knife?

1275
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,540
是你先前威胁马吉欧时所用的
It's the one you pulled on Maggio.

1276
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,460
普威特
Prew

1277
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:41,260
出了什么事
What's...

1278
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,010
普威特
Prew

1279
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:49,220
没事了
It's all right.

1280
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:55,230
别担心  别担心  我死不了

普威特还是没有出席
Prewitt's still absent.

1289
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:38,110
已经三天了
Makes three days now.

1290
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:43,650
你还要替他瞒多久
How long are you gonna carry him present Top?

1291
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,070
-我只是说说  -那么就别再说了
- I just mention it. - Well don't mention it.

1292
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,380
"督察长
"Upon observing these incidents

1293
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,170
展开调查
"an investigation was made by the Inspector General's department

1294
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:01,510
这些事件数个月
"over a period of several months.

1295
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:03,220
发现荷姆斯上尉
"It was found that Captain Holmes

1296
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:05,220
对普威特士兵残酷的罪行
has been guilty of indefensible cruelty

1297
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,260
是无可辩解的
"to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

1298
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,900
其中包括唆使运用
"As mentioned this included the instigation

1299
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:11,470
未经许可的方式
of wholly unauthorized tactics

1300
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:15,190
意图强迫他参加军团拳击赛"
"to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team."

1301
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:22,480
我正在等你回答
I'm waiting for your reply.

1302
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:24,150
我无话可说  长官
I haven't any sir.

1303
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:28,200
荷姆斯  我在军队中  学习到的第一件事
Holmes the first thing I learned in the army

1304
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,990
就是军官要好好照顾部属
was that an officer takes care of his men.

1305
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,870
但这似乎是你最早忘记的事
It seems to be the first thing that you forgot.

1306
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,620
我很遗憾必须让你保留军职
My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform

1307
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,710
直到军事法庭做出判决
until a court-martial is concluded.

1308
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:42,250
若有办法能免除上军事法庭
If there were any way to avoid a court-martial sir.

1309
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,380
如果你愿意的话  将军  我倒有另一项选择
There is one alternative General if you are so disposed.

1310
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:52,510
依照陆军规定辞职
A resignation for the good of the service under army regulations.

1311
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:56,730
下午就提出辞呈
Write a letter of resignation. Have it on my desk this afternoon.

1312
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:58,730
据我所知
As far as I'm concerned

1313
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:01,690
你愈快离开陆军  对大家愈有利
the quicker you're out of the army the better for everybody

1314
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:03,820
尤其是对陆军
especially the army.

1315
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,570
就这样决定  荷姆斯
That's all Holmes.

1316
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:17,000
我很清楚事情的发展
I know what's been going on in this outfit.

1317
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,460
也知道你有多么过份
I know how far some of you have been out of line.

1318
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:22,790
如果你还想继任无委任状士官  就得赶紧努力
If you want to remain noncoms you'd better snap into it.

1319
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,260
从现在开始
And another thing from now on

1320
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:28,010
拳击已无法替任何人赢得官阶
no man's gonna earn his stripes by boxing.

1321
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:32,930
-把那些扔掉  -是的  长官
- Get rid of those. - Yes sir.

1322
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,930

1323
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,770

- About Sergeant Galovitch. - Yes sir.

1324
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,610
将他降级为葛罗维奇大兵
Bust him. Sergeant Galovitch is now Private Galovitch.

1325
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,940
派他去管厕所
Put him in charge of the latrine.

1326
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:49,950
你在笑什么
What are you grinning at?

1327
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:52,740
军团连长做了明智决定
I think the company commander made a wise decision sir.

1328
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,700
参谋部  罗斯上尉
Company Captain Ross.

1329
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:02,880
-请等一下  你的电话  -谢谢你  长官
- Just a minute. It's for you Sergeant. - Thank you sir.

1330
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,380
是的  长官
Yes sir?

1331
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:13,300
是的  包裹已经到了
Yes the parcel has already arrived.

1332
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,810
什么
What?

1333
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:18,730
我必须见你一面  这件事很重要
I've got to see you Milt. It's important.

1334
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:25,900
好的  我想办法去  当然  没有问题
Okay I'll get away somehow. Sure that'd be fine.

1335
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:29,400
我一小时之内赶到
Yeah. I'll be there in about an hour.

1336
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:30,780
好的
Right.

1337
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:36,120
他下礼拜就要被送回去
He's being sent back to the States. He's sailing next week.

1338
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,250
他要我跟他一起走  我们怎么办
He wants me to go with him. What'll we do?

1339
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,960
你何时能拿到派令
When do you think you'll get your commission?

1340
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,210
我没有申请
I didn't put it in.

1341
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,470
我是填好了但并没有签名
I filled it out but I didn't sign it.

1342
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:55,470
我把它拿出来许多次  但就是无法签名
I took it out of my desk a dozen times but I couldn't sign it.

1343
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,510
为什么
Why?

1344
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:00,770
-这是我们的计划
But it was the plan.

1345
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:03,190
-我知道  -还有好几周时间
- I know I know. - It's been weeks.

1346
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:05,480
你不能光说不做
You can't just say you'll do a thing and then not do it.

1347
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,860
凯伦  听我说
Karen listen to me.

1348
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:09,780
你为什么不申请  你为什么不告诉我
But why didn't you do it? Why didn't you tell me?

1349
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,280
我马上回来
Be back in a minute.

1350
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,620
对不起  我以为你是某人
I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

1351
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,410
我以为是我们
I thought it was a guy from our

1352
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:28,460
军团的普威特
company Prewitt the kid I was telling you about.

1353
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:31,340
他迷上俱乐部的女孩
The one that got mixed up with one of the girls at the New Congress Club.

1354
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:34,760
他不假外出  可能有大麻烦
He's A.W.O.L. Probably in lots of trouble.

1355
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:37,680
罗勃普威特是个疯狂的坏家伙
Robert E. Lee Prewitt a crazy no good...

1356
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:44,480
凯伦  我不是当军官的料  我是个军人
Karen I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.

1357
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,690
别的事我都做不来
I can't be anything else.

1358
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:47,980
我一定只会装装样子
If I try to be an officer I'll be putting on an act.

1359
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,980
我就是办不到  请不要问我原因
I just can't do it. Please don't ask me why.

1360
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:56,030
我知道原因
I know why.

1361
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,200
因为现在唐纳已经离开军队
You don't have to become an officer now Milt

1362
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,830
所以你用不着去当军官
now that Dana's out of the army.

1363
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:03,460
你就是不想娶我
You just don't want to marry me.

1364
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,210
你己经结了婚  娶了陆军
You're already married to the army.

1365
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:08,290
我是爱你的  凯伦
I love you Karen.

1366
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:15,510
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

1367
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,760
我不希望你回到他身边
I don't want you to go back to Holmes.

1368
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:22,220
我也不想但我是在他身边
I don't want to either but I am.

1369
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:24,940
我已经无能为力
There's nothing else for me to do.

1370
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:27,940
对我们并没有好处  从来不可能有好结果
It's no good with us Milt. It could never have been any good.

1371
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:30,110
这样东躲西藏
Hiding and sneaking.

1372
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:32,150
磨耗了我们的感情
It had to wear out.

1373
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,360
再见了  上士
Goodbye Sergeant.

1374
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:40,620
-谢谢  -这不是再见而是
- Thanks. - It ain't goodbye. It's...

1375
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:44,410
总有一天我们会再某处重逢
We'll see each other again somewhere.

1376
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:47,250
我们当然会
Of course we will.

1377
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,460

他们以为在向谁挑衅

对不起
I'm sorry.

1470
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:36,150
你为什么想回去
What do you want to go back to the army for?

1471
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,990
陆军根本视你如粪土
What did the army ever do for you besides treat you like dirt

1472
01:51:39,070 --> 01:51:42,660

They say they've seen parachutists land up in the hills.

你就是不能从善如流
You just couldn't play it smart could you?

不过是要你打拳罢了  可是你这个死脑筋就是不肯
All you had to do was box. But no not you you hardhead.
