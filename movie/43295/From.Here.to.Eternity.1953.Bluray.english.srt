1
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,112
Pull!

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,989
Right face!

3
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,828
Right forward, pull!

4
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,083
Right forward, march!

5
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,837
Count, keep count!

6
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:49,424
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

7
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,467
Count, keep count!

8
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,221
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,265
Count, keep count!

10
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,435
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

11
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,144
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,774
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,653
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,701
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

15
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,703
Count, keep count!

16
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,415
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

17
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,041
Count, keep count!

18
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,504
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

19
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,182
Hey, Maggio! Hello!

20
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,059
Hiya, Prew.

21
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,023
What are you doing over here?

22
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,358
Transferred over from Fort Shafter.

23
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,236
- You quit the Bugle Corps?
- Yep.

24
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,655
- For here?
- I didn't pick it.

25
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,617
Oh, you made a very bad mistake.

26
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,869
This outfit, they can give back
to General Custer.

27
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,370
Yeah?

28
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,752
Captain ain't in yet.

29
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,381
I'll look around.

30
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,609
What do you think you're doin'?

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,405
- What's your name?
- Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

32
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,741
I heard about you.

33
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,328
I heard about you, too, Sergeant.

34
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,413
This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.

35
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,291
You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself
before sundown.

36
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,752
Put up your cue and come along.

37
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,514
Grand went to the hospital yesterday.
Did you put him in the sick book?

38
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,891
- Did you make out the morning report?
- I didn't have time, Sergeant.

39
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,101
You're the company clerk, Mazzioli.

40
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,645
Those medics didn't bring back
the sick book till late yesterday.

41
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,274
- I'll tend to it right now.
- Thanks. I already done it for you.

42
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,574
You're the best bugler
they got over at Shafter.

43
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,868
You're the best bugler
they got on this whole island.

44
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,411
That's true.

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,747
I feel for you, pal.

46
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,375
But from my position,
I can't quite reach you.

47
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,092
Ten-hut!

48
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,096
- At ease.
- Morning, sir.

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,849
Morning, men. Anything special for me
this morning, Sergeant Warden?

50
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,643
- I've only a few minutes.
- Yes, sir. New man here.

51
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,770
Oh, yes. Come in.

52
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,362
Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

53
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,406
Reporting to the company
commander, as ordered.

54
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,409
At ease. Where's that service record?

55
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,497
Born in Kentucky, enlisted
first at Fort Myer, Virginia.

56
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,917
"Bugle Corps, First Bugler."

57
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,546
Prewitt, I always make it a policy
to talk to my new men.

58
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,673
Now, I have a fine, smooth-running outfit.

59
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,635
If I like a soldier,
he can get to be a noncommissioned officer

60
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,178
quicker here than anywhere else.

61
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,222
But he has to show me that
he's got it on the ball.

62
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,267
What kind of trouble were
you in in the Bugle Corps?

63
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,103
- No trouble, sir.
- What made you transfer out then?

64
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,230
It was a personal matter.

65
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,318
- Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
- Why, yes, sir.

66
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,820
Prewitt, you was a corporal
in the Bugle Corps.

67
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,115
You took a bust to buck private
to transfer to an infantry outfit.

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,618
Why? Because you like to hike?

69
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,204
Or was it because
you couldn't stand to bugle?

70
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,289
It was a personal matter.

71
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,875
That's up to the company commander
to decide.

72
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,001
Well?

73
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,713
I was First Bugler for two years.

74
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,967
The topkick had a friend
who transferred in from another outfit.

75
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,552
The next day, he was made
First Bugler over me.

76
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,554
I was a better bugler.

77
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,890
And you asked out on account of that?

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,727
Maybe it ain't sensible,
but that's the reason.

79
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,730
His feelings were hurt.
Kids they send us now!

80
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,234
Well, we'll get your stripes back for you,
maybe an extra one for good measure.

81
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,819
Do you know why you were assigned
to "G" Company?

82
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:20,861
No, sir.

83
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,991
I pulled a few strings.
I'm the regimental boxing coach, you know.

84
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,909
Yes, sir.

85
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,245
I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl
year before last.

86
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,081
- You should have won it.
- Thank you, sir.

87
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,625
Our regiment got beaten
in the finals last December,

88
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,419
but I mean to win this year.

89
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,587
All I've needed was a top middleweight.

90
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,008
I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.

91
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,719
Quit fighting? When? What for?

92
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,930
Well, over a year ago.

93
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,017
Maybe you heard about
what happened with Dixie Wells?

94
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,728
You mean that fellow that got hurt?

95
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,896
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, I heard about that.

96
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,191
It's too bad. I can understand how you feel.
But those things happen.

97
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,527
That's why I decided I would quit, sir.

98
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,780
You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed.

99
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,409
Our fighting program is
the best morale builder we have.

100
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,045
I've got a mighty sour company bugler.

101
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,757
- How'd you like the job?
- Not if it means fighting.

102
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,719
Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire
a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt.

103
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,723
You should know that in the army
it's not the individual that counts.

104
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,977
Well, you'll find that we won't put
any pressure on you in my outfit.

105
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,522
Just don't make any mistakes in it,
that's all.

106
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,358
I've got to go into town.
Anything else for me today, Sergeant?

107
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,652
The company fund report has got
to be made out, it's due tomorrow.

108
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,030
- You make it out. Is that all?
- No, sir.

109
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,491
Well, whatever it is, you fix it up.

110
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,993
If there's anything that has
to go in this afternoon, sign my name.

111
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,245
- I won't be back.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,666
He'd strangle in his own spit
if he didn't have me around here

113
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,668
to swab his throat out for him.

114
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,296
Come on.

115
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,727
You been in the army what now, Prewitt?
Five years? Five and a half?

116
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:17,812
Yeah.

117
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,940
Don't you think it's about time
you got smart?

118
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,528
You know what you did just now
when you turned down Dynamite Holmes?

119
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,657
You put your head in a noose.
Things are softer for a boxer in this outfit.

120
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,450
Otherwise,
you'd better know how to soldier.

121
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,828
- I can soldier with any man.

122
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,176
This place is gettin' to be like
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

123
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,974
Who is that?

124
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,684
She's Captain Holmes' wife.

125
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,270
You'll fight, Prewitt.

126
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,481
You'll fight because Captain Holmes
wants to be Major Holmes.

127
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,442
He's got an idea he'll make it
if he gets a winning team.

128
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,987
And if you don't do it for him,
you'll do it for me.

129
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,947
'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?

130
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:14,243
The more he's happy, the less he bothers me
and the better I run this company.

131
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,955
So we know where we stand, don't we, kid?

132
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,876
I know where I stand.
A man don't go his own way, he's nothing.

133
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,880
Maybe back in the days of the pioneers
a man could go his own way,

134
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,424
but today you've gotta play ball.

135
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,264
Leva!

136
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,642
Can't I once walk up to the supply room
and find you working with both hands?

137
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,520
I can't do no better
on what you people pay me!

138
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,232
Draw this man some supplies.
"G" Company squad room's on the top floor.

139
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,026
Get rid of your bags and come back here.

140
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,030
Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.
Save you making four or five trips.

141
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,617
- Thanks.
- I just hate to see energy wasted.

142
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,119
Besides, you'll be needing yours.

143
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,166
Looks like a good man.

144
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,628
I know his type. He's a hardhead.

145
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,515
Her and them sweaters.

146
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,809
I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.

147
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,313
Not her, Top.
She knows the score like I been tellin' you.

148
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,066
- Is that right?
- Listen, not around here.

149
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,068
But when I soldiered
at Fort Bliss with Holmes,

150
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,445
I heard plenty about this lady, plenty.

151
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,656
- You did, huh?
- Okay, not me.

152
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,992
But I know some of the guys
she played around with, so don't tell me.

153
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,828
I ain't tellin' you. You're tellin' me.

154
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,294
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Morning, ma'am.

155
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,712
I'm looking for my husband.

156
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,548
Captain Holmes just went into town, ma'am,
on business.

157
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,010
He was to have left some things for me.
Do you know anything about them?

158
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,097
No, I don't, ma'am.
Anything I can do for you?

159
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,391
No, thanks.

160
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,394
I'd be glad to help, ma'am.

161
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,155
My husband's been telling me
a lot about you, Sergeant.

162
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,243
- He says you're very efficient.
- Yes, ma'am.

163
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,329
What is it that makes you
so efficient, Sergeant?

164
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,039
I was born smart, ma'am.

165
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,795
I love that. Well, goodbye, Sergeant.

166
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,467
Man, she sure is one, ain't she?

167
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,012
- One what?
- One woman.

168
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,055
I've seen better.

169
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,399
Karen? Karen?

170
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,245
- Sorry I'm late.
- It doesn't matter.

171
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,372
I got tied up with General Slater.

172
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,375
- I bumped into him in the Officer's Club.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,129
- What did the General have to say?
- Success, he said.

174
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,341
Success in war, success in peace time.

175
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,843
And not a word about my promotion.

176
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,347
Sometimes I think
the old man's just waiting to ship me down.

177
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,849
Well, if you'd spend less time
buttering generals

178
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,352
and more time with your company,
you'd get that promotion.

179
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,354
The company takes care of itself.

180
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,274
I went over there today, looking for you.

181
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,527
I had some business
to attend to at Kaneohe.

182
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,821
That was all right, wasn't it?

183
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:42,117
Of course.
I have no right to inquire into your actions.

184
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,453
- That was our agreement.
- Then why bring it up?

185
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,540
Because I wanted you to know I'm not
as stupid as you maintain all women are.

186
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,584
Now, just what does that mean?

187
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,253
- What are you accusing me of now?
- Of nothing.

188
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,423
It's no longer any of my business
how many women you go out with, is it?

189
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,301
But I wish you could
just be honest about it once.

190
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,096
There's no reason I should try
to hide anything, is there?

191
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,973
The way things are between us now,

192
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,519
what right have you
to always be accusing me?

193
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,437
What right?

194
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,442
Are you going back to that again?

195
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,279
How long will it be, I wonder,
before I'm allowed to live that down?

196
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,865
How many times do I have to tell you
it was an accident?

197
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,870
Please, Dana. I'm going to bed.

198
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,207
Please get out of my bedroom.

199
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,071
Captain Holmes says you don't want
to come out and fight for us.

200
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,990
That's right.

201
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,993
We thought we'd buy you a beer
and talk it over.

202
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,036
We're the company boxers.

203
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,248
I figured.

204
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,385
Man, what I would not give
to have this character

205
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,220
in the corner pool room in my hometown.

206
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,894
Box as good as you used to,
we'd be a cinch this year.

207
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,732
You ain't forget, division champs
get 10-day furloughs, did you, son?

208
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,072
I'm Ike Galovitch,
platoon guide of your platoon.

209
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,575
And don't think you're a tough guy,
Prewitt.

210
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,245
You no talk now, but out in the field with us
you sing different song.

211
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,832
Listen, the guy don't have to fight if he
don't want to without gettin' kicked around.

212
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,584
Now, we're playing pool.
Why don't you take off?

213
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,669
- You want busted head, Maggio?
- No.

214
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,671
Then keep your big nose out altogether.

215
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,174
Training season starts next week.
You can pick up your stuff...

216
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,677
Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you.

217
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,890
I ain't fightin'. I quit fightin'.

218
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,227
You guys want to put the screws on,
go right ahead!

219
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:17,439
- I can take anything you can dish out.
- Okay, Prewitt.

220
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:25,989
Thanks.

221
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,787
I just hate to see a good guy
get it in the gut.

222
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,250
You better get used to it, kid.
You'll probably see a lot of it before you die.

223
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,176
You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?

224
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,888
Do you know anything
in army regulations says I gotta box?

225
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,808
Every boxer in this outfit's a noncom.

226
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,814
I guess you've never seen a bunch of 'em
get together and give a man the treatment.

227
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,777
What do you mean "chick"? She's 45.

228
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,112
She's still too young for you.

229
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,615
Now, listen, Warden, I'm a better man
than you any day, and don't forget it.

230
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,409
I won't forget it.

231
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,746
What's the deal with him, anyway?

232
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,165
With Warden. I don't figure him.

233
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,126
Warden?

234
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,171
He ain't like the others.

235
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,301
He'll make it tough on you.

236
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,805
But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,
and he won't come over it.

237
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,517
You don't see many
topkicks like him no more.

238
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,521
He was with the 15th in Shanghai
when they saw their action.

239
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,316
I heard about it
down in the Philippines even.

240
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,611
All I know is,
he's the best soldier I ever saw.

241
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,465
Hut! Hut! Hut, two, three, four!

242
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,300
Hut! Hut!

243
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,804
Count, keep count!

244
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,850
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

245
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,769
Prewitt! Get in step, Prewitt!

246
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,313
Hut! Hut!

247
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,441
Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic.
Get in step!

248
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,235
Hut! Hut! Hut!

249
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,406
Platoon halt!

250
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,743
Order arms!

251
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,248
Left face!

252
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,461
Prewitt, one step forward march.

253
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,506
Prewitt, you march
like a drunken gooney bird.

254
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,550
I gotta teach you how to drill.
You stay here.

255
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,553
Platoon dismissed!

256
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,892
Detail, right face!

257
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,980
Trail forward, march!

258
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,775
Half left, march!

259
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,863
Half right, march!

260
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,865
Right flank, march!

261
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,867
Left flank, march!

262
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,870
To the rear, march! One, two, three!

263
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,457
To the rear, march!
Rear, march! Rear, march!

264
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:27,129
Rear, march! Rear, march!
Rear, march! Rear, march!

265
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,007
Assemble your weapons. All right, start.

266
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,928
A rifle's your best friend.

267
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,890
In case it jams in combat,
it could mean life or death.

268
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:43,812
So you gotta learn to strip 'em down
and put 'em back together again blindfolded.

269
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,499
Your rear sight's way off.

270
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,169
You'd be 50 feet off target at 300 yards.

271
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,756
Now, that's what happens when a soldier
don't know how to assemble his rifle.

272
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Seven laps around the track, double time,
and keep this rifle at high port.

273
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,109
Forward thrust, hold!

274
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,613
Draw and recover, hold!

275
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,657
Arm thrust, hold!

276
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,205
Draw and recover, hold!

277
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,248
And rest!

278
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,292
Wide open, huh, Prewitt?

279
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,128
Maybe seven more laps will teach you
to watch yourself.

280
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,256
Are you crazy? I saw what you did!

281
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,195
I'm tellin' you, Top,
she's nothin' but trouble.

282
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,655
You better keep your mind
off what you're thinking.

283
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,658
What do you wanna do,
wind up in Leavenworth?

284
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,755
I won't be back in time
to take retreat, Sergeant.

285
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,591
- Or reveille, either.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,846
All work and no play, Sergeant.

287
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,807
All you do is sit around
sweating over papers.

288
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,685
There are other things
in the world besides work.

289
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,272
- You ought to get out more yourself, Warden.
- I've been considering it.

290
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,650
Well, I'm going.
I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.

291
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,279
It'll be here when you get back, sir.

292
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,564
Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

293
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,153
You'd better step inside,
or you'll get wet.

294
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,740
I am wet.

295
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,702
If you're looking for the captain,
he isn't here.

296
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,996
And if I'm not looking for him?

297
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,999
He still isn't here.

298
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,418
Well, I'm looking for him.
Do you know where he is?

299
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,171
I haven't the slightest idea.

300
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,548
Perhaps he's "in town on business."

301
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,718
That's the way you put it
the other day, isn't it?

302
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,638
I got some papers
it's important for him to sign.

303
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,727
I'll try phoning him at the club.
Maybe he's there.

304
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,187
Don't do that.

305
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,191
I never like to disturb
a man when he's drinking.

306
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,071
I could use a drink myself.

307
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,866
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

308
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,710
The liquor's there, Sergeant,
in the cabinet.

309
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:45,428
You're taking an awful chance, you know.
My maid is liable to be home any time.

310
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,224
No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.

311
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,687
You think of everything,
don't you, Sergeant?

312
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,439
I try. In my position, you have to.

313
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,575
Are these really important?

314
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,079
Yes. But not important to get signed today.
Tomorrow's okay.

315
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:19,629
I got copies at the office,
so it won't be much work to fix them up.

316
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:23,341
That's what I like about you, Sergeant.
You have confidence.

317
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,427
It's also what I dislike about you.

318
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,513
It's not confidence, ma'am. It's honesty.

319
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,433
I just hate to see a beautiful woman
going all to waste.

320
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,393
"Waste," did you say?

321
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,814
There's a subject I might
tell you something about.

322
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,900
I know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.

323
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,362
You're probably not even remotely aware
of some of them.

324
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,698
Would you like to hear?

325
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,368
For instance, what about
the house without a child?

326
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,787
There's one sort for you.

327
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,541
Then there's another.

328
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,214
You're doing fine, Sergeant.

329
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,549
My husband's off somewhere,

330
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,677
and it's raining outside
and we're both drinking now.

331
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:11,473
You've probably only got one thing wrong,
the lady herself.

332
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,476
The lady's not what she seems.

333
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,646
She's a washout, if you know what I mean.

334
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,483
And I'm sure you know what I mean.

335
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,651
You gonna cry?

336
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,529
Not if I can help it.

337
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,372
What are you doing?

338
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,378
I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?

339
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,383
I don't know, Sergeant. I don't know.

340
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,963
Step on it, boy!

341
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,464
- Speed it up.
- I'm speedin'.

342
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,383
Payday, payday

343
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,055
All right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?
Knock it off.

344
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,225
Angelo, a dollar he's wrong, coming up.

345
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,853
Hey, paisan, come here!

346
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,022
Sorry, gentlemen,
I already won my bankroll in the latrine.

347
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,151
Besides, it's a penny-ante game.

348
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,903
All right, what are you covering here?

349
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,909
Come on, buddy boy, we're goin' to town.

350
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,130
Look, don't let 'em get your goat.

351
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,758
We'll just dress up in civvies and we're as
good as the rest of the world, ain't we?

352
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,930
Here, wear this.

353
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,602
My sister sent it to me.
She buys everything too big.

354
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,317
Look, first we'll hit a few bars, see?

355
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,361
Then we go to a place of which I'm a member,
the New Congress Club.

356
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,280
Girls.

357
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,116
You got any prejudices against girls?

358
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,954
That's what I thought.

359
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,126
Well, now, looks like you're
all primed for a big night, Top.

360
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,337
- Hello, Stark.
- Want some company?

361
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,380
No, thanks. All tied up.

362
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,174
Leva tells me you've been eyeing
the captain's wife

363
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,051
like a hound dog at huntin' time.

364
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,054
He has, huh?
What else did that character tell you?

365
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,723
She took up with a lot of men
back there at Fort Bliss.

366
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,351
Well,
I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.

367
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,979
This ain't no story,
'cause I was one of them myself.

368
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,234
Not for long, though.
Sure is something strange about that woman.

369
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,986
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

370
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,988
See ya.

371
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,623
Hello.

372
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,669
- I didn't think you were coming.
- Why not? I ain't late.

373
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,507
No, I guess you're not.
But then I got here a little early.

374
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,301
I must have been overanxious.
You weren't, though, were you?

375
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,096
I stopped along the way
for a couple of drinks.

376
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,473
You certainly chose
a lovely spot for our meeting.

377
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,309
I've had three chances to be picked up
in the last five minutes.

378
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,520
Well,
that's par for the course around here.

379
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,649
Well, I don't care for it.
I never went in much for back-alley loving.

380
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,693
Take it easy.

381
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,446
You probably think I'm a tramp.

382
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,950
Now, what makes you think
I'd think a thing like that?

383
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,160
Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant.

384
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,205
If you think this is a mistake,
come right out and say so.

385
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:11,129
Well, I guess it's about time for me
to be getting home, isn't it?

386
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,923
- Well, isn't it?
- What's the matter?

387
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,800
What started all this anyway?

388
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,219
Do you think I'd be here
if I thought it was a mistake?

389
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,221
Taking a chance on 20 years in Leavenworth

390
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,640
for making dates with
the company commander's wife?

391
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:26,769
And her actin' like Lady Astor's horse.
And all because I got here on time!

392
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,027
Well, on the other hand,
I've got a bathing suit under my dress.

393
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,487
Me, too.

394
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,653
She's comin'.

395
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,366
Why, it's Angelo Maggio!

396
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,659
Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

397
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,253
There you are, sweetie pie.
Dues all paid up.

398
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,256
Hey, who you got playing the piano there?
A hippo?

399
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,509
Oh, Angelo,
I don't think I've met your friend.

400
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,511
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

401
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,971
Oh, you know how I hate it
when you boys are in this condition.

402
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,556
You see that, buddy boy?

403
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,684
A woman sees a soldier,
and, like that, she figures he's drunk.

404
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,479
- Why? You know why?
- Because he is.

405
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,857
Well, heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
with the entertainment business.

406
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,485
Every respectable place
has to consider its future.

407
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:02,073
Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, you have my solemn
word your future will be safe with us!

408
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,158
Angelo is one of my favorites.

409
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:08,830
Annette, dear, take care of this
gentleman for me, will you, please?

410
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,499
That'll be four bucks, baby face.

411
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,710
Two for initiation fee,
two for this month's dues.

412
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,129
What do I get for it?

413
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,965
Members are entitled
to all privileges of the club,

414
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,426
which includes dancing,
snack bar, soft drink bar

415
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,928
and gentlemanly relaxation
with the opposite gender,

416
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,514
so long as they are gentlemen
and no liquor is permitted.

417
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,808
- Got it?
- I got it.

418
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,302
Girls, here's some new poison.
This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.

419
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,096
- Nice meeting you.
- Hi, there.

420
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,315
Don't tell me the princess is your style.

421
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,445
This is Suzanne and Roxanne.

422
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,072
- Hello, there.
- Would you like to dance, honey?

423
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,908
Hey!

424
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:35,124
Much as I adore your company,
I hope I may be allowed to tear myself away.

425
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,834
I just saw a few friends at the door,

426
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,087
and I can also see
that I will be of no further use to you.

427
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,935
Hi. You busy?

428
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,021
What's your name?

429
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,148
I'm Lorene.

430
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,275
Lorene, huh?

431
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,905
I haven't seen you in here before.

432
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,909
I haven't been in here before.
My friend brought me.

433
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,703
He and I, we're stationed out at Schofield.

434
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,039
Oh, I didn't think you were a soldier.

435
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,917
- What do you mean?
- Well, I...

436
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,003
I'm a 30-year man.
I'm in for the whole ride.

437
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,465
Well, I suppose it's different when
a fella's gonna make a career of it.

438
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,594
Ain't nothin' the matter with a soldier
that ain't the matter with everyone else.

439
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,597
I like you just the same.

440
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,433
I liked you the minute
I saw Annette bringing you in.

441
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:39,939
You did? It's funny, I came in, I stood there
and saw you sittin' over here.

442
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,483
Why don't you knock it off
or put a mute in that thing!

443
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,528
I'll play loud as I want, you little wop!

444
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,779
Little wop?

445
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,907
Mess with me, fat stuff,
and I'll bust you up.

446
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,827
You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.

447
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,997
- Wait right here for me, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

448
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,749
Gentlemen, you know I will not...

449
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,127
This little Mussolini here
is tryin' to tell me how...

450
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,045
Like to bust my eardrums
with the stinkin' noise!

451
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,755
- Let's not be cruel.
- Break it up, Angelo.

452
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,133
You men will just have to go
if you can't behave yourselves.

453
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,469
- Only my friends call me wop.
- Do you know who that guy is?

454
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,597
- What do I care who he is?
- Who is he?

455
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,975
Fatso Judson, Sergeant of the Guard
in the stockade.

456
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,981
I'm tellin' you, let him alone.

457
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,358
I seen him nearly murder a guy once.
He likes it.

458
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,695
Okay, bully boy, now you won the war.
Let's dance, huh?

459
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,698
Yeah, we'll dance, we'll dance.
First I gotta calm my nerves.

460
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,450
Let's go to a phone booth
or something, huh?

461
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:37,246
Where I will unveil a fifth of whiskey I have
here under my loose-flowing sports shirt.

462
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,582
Don't get hurt, pal.

463
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,179
Your balance has got to be letter perfect.

464
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,306
I thought you were gonna wait.

465
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,309
- Bill here was telling me about surfboarding.
- Hello, friend.

466
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,187
Just sit down and listen.
He describes it thrillingly.

467
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,147
Do you know anything about surfboarding?

468
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,316
No, nothing. Not a thing.

469
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,028
You must be stationed inland, then.
I'm at DeRussy, so I get lots of chances.

470
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,946
Yeah, but then we got mountains.

471
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,948
Do you know anything
about mountain climbing?

472
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,033
A little bit.

473
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,327
- You a mountain climber?
- No.

474
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,037
Do you know anything
about flying an airplane?

475
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,413
I've had a few lessons.

476
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,917
I can't fly, either.
What do you know about deep-sea diving?

477
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,463
Bill, shall we move into another room?

478
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,008
Sure. The air in here seems
to have gotten lousy, hasn't it?

479
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,426
- I noticed that.
- Listen, fella...

480
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,178
Come on, let's go.

481
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,245
How was the deep-sea diver?

482
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,080
That was a terrible way you acted.

483
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,999
Maybe I was jealous.

484
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,378
You're a funny one.

485
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,882
What do you dames want?
To tease a man to death?

486
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:56,594
What do you think Mrs. Kipfer hires us for?
She pays us to be nice to all the boys.

487
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,930
You're all alike. Is it so important?

488
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,559
It is important. We may seem all alike.
We ain't all alike.

489
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,274
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,942
Look...

491
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,071
Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's parlor
and sit there.

492
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:19,658
She lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special.

493
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,702
I'll go ask her.

494
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,538
- Then you're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

495
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:29,043
Because if you're still mad,
I'd just rather we called the whole thing off.

496
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,087
You certainly are a funny one.

497
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,171
I never knew it could be like this.

498
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,841
Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

499
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,176
Nobody?

500
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,428
No, nobody.

501
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:25,099
Not even one?
Out of all the men you've been kissed by?

502
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,352
Now, that'd take some figuring.

503
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,438
- How many men do you think there've been?
- I wouldn't know.

504
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,900
- Can't you give me a rough estimate?
- Not without an adding machine.

505
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,529
- Do you have your adding machine with you?
- I forgot to bring it.

506
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,490
Then I guess you won't find out, will you?

507
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,369
Maybe I already know.

508
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,794
What's the matter? What are you hinting at?

509
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,463
Why? Is there something to hint at?

510
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,758
Maybe there's been a long line
of beach parties.

511
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,428
- You must be crazy.
- Am I?

512
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,681
What about when you and Holmes
were back at Fort Bliss?

513
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:10,019
Did you ever hear of a soldier named Stark?
Maylon Stark?

514
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,526
Why, yes.

515
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,696
"Why, yes." You knew him, too, didn't you?

516
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,698
Didn't you?

517
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,951
I had to go and forget
you were like all the rest of them.

518
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,829
Only it's true, ain't it? Well, ain't it?

519
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,842
Why don't you tell me about it?
Tell me the story.

520
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,011
There's always a story.

521
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,097
You don't leave a person anything, do you?

522
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,035
Come back here, Sergeant.
I'll tell you the story.

523
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,123
You can take it back to the barracks with you.

524
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:24,468
I'd only been married to Dana two years
when I found out he was cheating.

525
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:29,390
And by that time, I was pregnant.
I thought I had something to hope for.

526
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,685
I was almost happy
the night the pains began.

527
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,813
I remember Dana was going
to an officer's conference.

528
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,232
I told him to get home early,
to bring the doctor with him.

529
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,111
And maybe he would have, if his conference
hadn't been with a hat check girl.

530
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,572
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

531
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,825
I was lying on the floor.

532
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:51,829
I begged him to go for the doctor,
but he fell on the couch and passed out.

533
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,833
The baby was born about an hour later.

534
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,336
Of course it was dead. It was a boy.

535
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,548
But they worked over me at the hospital.
They fixed me up fine.

536
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:05,342
They even took my appendix out.
They threw that in free.

537
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:09,430
- Karen?
- And one more thing. No more children.

538
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,394
Sure, I went out with men after that,
and if I'd ever found one that...

539
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,646
Karen, listen to me. Listen.

540
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,527
I know.

541
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,322
Until I met you,
I didn't think it was possible either.

542
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:48,886
I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own
to get away from my hometown in Oregon.

543
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,971
How come?

544
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,348
I had a boyfriend.

545
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,810
I was a waitress,
and he was from the richest family in town.

546
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,396
He just married a girl
suitable for his position.

547
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,483
After three years of going around with me.

548
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,487
It's a pretty story, isn't it?
Maybe they could write a book about it.

549
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,697
They did. Thousands of them.

550
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,700
So I left and went to Seattle.

551
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,078
I got there and I met a girl
just back from Hawaii,

552
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,413
and she said she'd made
a lot of money working there.

553
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,207
So I caught the first boat.

554
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,209
I've been here a year and two months.

555
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,419
You don't like it very much, do you?

556
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:26,507
Oh, I don't like it, but I don't mind it.
Anyway, I won't be here forever.

557
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,343
No. Sure. I mean, why should you?

558
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:34,181
I got it all figured out. In another year,
I'll be home with a stocking full of money.

559
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,517
And I'll be all set for life.

560
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,186
Who is it?

561
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:50,572
I didn't hear no sounds of combat,
so I thought you might want a drink.

562
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,325
- You've been hogging the whiskey, Angelo.
- Not me, buddy.

563
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,537
It's that Sandra.
She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.

564
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,125
I hope there's a cop under that.

565
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,213
Keep pourin'. Keep pourin'.

566
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,428
No, thanks. I don't drink.
I think it's a weakness.

567
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,558
I grant you that.

568
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,187
I don't like weakness. Do you?

569
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,399
No, I don't like weakness,
but I like to drink.

570
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:33,031
Hey, what are you gonna do, marry this guy?

571
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,534
You're grinnin' at him like you're his wife.

572
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,035
Get out of here.

573
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,497
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

574
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,834
Back to old long-legged Sandra.
I love 'em tall.

575
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,378
Acres and acres.

576
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:55,179
Enjoy yourself, paisan.
You need this more than I do.

577
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,182
Tomorrow,
you'll be back with the treatment.

578
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,728
What does he mean?

579
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:08,025
Hey, that was nice before,
the way you snuggled up in front of him.

580
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,360
What's a "treatment"?

581
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:15,532
Oh, some of the guys puttin' me over
the jumps 'cause I don't want to fight.

582
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,992
Fight?

583
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:21,538
Yeah, on a boxing team. I don't want to box.
I don't even want to think about it.

584
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:24,124
Well, why should you have to box?

585
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,294
Well, see, I used to fight.

586
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,631
Middleweight. And I was pretty good.

587
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,592
They know it. Well, anyway...

588
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,846
Well, come on, tell me. I want to hear.

589
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,850
Well, the thing is, see...

590
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,561
I used to work out with this guy Dixie Wells.

591
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,022
He was a real good friend of mine.

592
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,317
Loved to box.
People on the outside had their eye on him.

593
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,529
He was gonna come out of the army
and go right up to the top.

594
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:58,867
Well, one afternoon,
he and I were sparring around in the gym,

595
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,203
you know, kind of friendly-like,

596
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:05,290
and he must have been set
pretty flat on his feet,

597
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,794
because I caught him with a...

598
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,090
No more than ordinary right cross...

599
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:19,471
And he didn't get up, he didn't move.

600
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:24,559
He was in a coma for a week,
and finally he did pull out of it.

601
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,729
Only the thing was that he was blind.

602
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,655
Well, I went to see him at the hospital
a couple of times,

603
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,492
then, finally, I just couldn't go back.

604
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,913
The last time, he and I started
talking about fighting, and...

605
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,293
He started to cry.

606
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,838
And seeing tears coming out of those eyes

607
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,465
that couldn't see anything.

608
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:25,078
I thought I oughta tell you.
Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.

609
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,331
From now on, it's no holds barred.

610
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,334
They aim to run you right into the stockade
if they got to.

611
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,336
Let 'em.

612
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,840
I'll help you as much as I can,
but I can't get too far out on a limb.

613
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,177
I ain't riskin' losing my stripes.
I like this outfit.

614
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,388
So do I. That's funny, ain't it?

615
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,099
Yeah. Yeah, that is funny.

616
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,024
Keep goin' in a straight line, Prewitt.

617
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,653
Keep goin'!

618
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,120
All right, that's enough.

619
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:23,095
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

620
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,819
My hitch was up Monday

621
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,280
Not a dog soldier no more

622
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,367
I ain't a soldier no more

623
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,122
They gave me all that money

624
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,250
So much my pockets is sore

625
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,794
Oh, my pockets is sore

626
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,838
Yeah, that a boy!

627
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,841
More dough than I can use

628
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:04,094
Reenlistment blues

629
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,429
Sing it, boys!

630
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,404
Time!

631
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,756
Clean up the mess, Prewitt!

632
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,970
Hurry it up!
You're on fatigue detail, not a vacation!

633
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:01,651
- Come on! Clean it up!
- Clean it up yourself!

634
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,361
What?

635
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,780
You heard me.
Rub your own nose in it a while.

636
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,409
Prewitt, you know better than to talk back
to a noncommissioned officer?

637
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:10,785
Yes, sir.

638
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,747
But I've never liked being spit on, sir,
not even by a noncommissioned officer.

639
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,082
You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.

640
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,169
I don't think so, sir. I think Sergeant
Galovitch owes me an apology.

641
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,213
- Corporal Peluso?
- Yes, sir?

642
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,257
Have this man roll a full field pack,
extra shoes and helmet,

643
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,969
take a bicycle and hike him up to Kolekole
Pass and back, then bring him to me.

644
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,931
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Prewitt, let's go.

645
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,224
Time!

646
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,444
Hold it a minute.

647
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:51,701
Go ahead, Prewitt, and have a cigarette.
I don't like this any more than you do.

648
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,203
Thanks.

649
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,460
I take it you're ready to apologize
to Sergeant Galovitch now?

650
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,212
No, sir, I'm not.

651
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,841
Peluso, take him up there again.

652
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,220
Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, let's go.

653
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:30,615
You can't be decent to a man like that.
You have to treat him like an animal.

654
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,037
Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.

655
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,540
Insubordination
to a noncommissioned officer.

656
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,041
Yes, sir.

657
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,430
- Only it's a shame.
- What is?

658
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,725
Well, I was just thinking, sir, It's too bad
you've gotta lose a good middleweight.

659
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,977
I don't care. I don't have
to stand for that kind of insolence.

660
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,520
No, sir, you sure don't.

661
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,192
I'll prepare the papers, then.

662
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,404
The only trouble is that even
if he gets just three months,

663
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,824
he'll still be in the stockade
when the boxing finals come up.

664
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,660
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

665
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:19,581
Well, you could double up
on company punishment, sir.

666
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,125
All right. I'll throw the book at him.

667
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,337
Yes, sir,
if you think that's the way to do it.

668
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,598
Nice goin', Sarge.

669
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:41,478
Keep lookin', Mazzioli, you'll find yourself
scrubbin' this orderly room floor!

670
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,625
Comin' through! Watch it!
Me and my waiters are working our tails off.

671
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,752
Hot! Hot! H-O-T!

672
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,009
How you doing, buddy boy? Better than
being thrown in the stockade, ain't it?

673
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,556
How am I doing, Sarge?
I'm a rough man, man.

674
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,934
Slow up a little there, Angelo,
so you can stop sweating in the food.

675
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,977
Don't hold me back, Sarge.
Don't hold me back.

676
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,313
I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.
Well, you'll never make it.

677
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,524
- Hiya, Sarge.
- Hiya, Top.

678
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,663
Life in a rifle company.

679
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,459
You look awful tired, kid.

680
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,213
How do you like straight duty?

681
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,675
- What makes you think I mind it, Warden?
- I didn't say you minded it.

682
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,052
I just said you looked tired.
You know, drawn to a fine edge.

683
00:50:56,137 --> 00:51:00,056
Oh, I like this life. It's a great life.

684
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,225
If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in.

685
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,269
Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?

686
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,813
If you didn't put me here,
I'd have no chance to find it, right?

687
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,316
Now, there's a man for you.
What do you know?

688
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,445
Since you like it so much,
I'll see if I can find some more for you.

689
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,488
How about garbage detail?

690
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,574
Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.

691
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:21,244
So you did. What about street cleaning?

692
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,706
- Yesterday.
- You got a better memory than me.

693
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,750
Of course, if you were smart...

694
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:28,918
Yeah, but I ain't smart.

695
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:32,213
I know, but if you were,
you wouldn't have to pull K.P.,

696
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,215
or any other fatigue duty, for that matter.

697
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:39,262
If you think you can bribe me into boxing,
Warden, you're wrong.

698
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:44,058
You're wrong. Not you
and Dynamite Holmes and the treatment.

699
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,319
How long are you guys gonna keep
breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?

700
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,614
You've had him on that extra duty roster
a month already.

701
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,616
- I can't see why you...
- Can't you, Pete?

702
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,367
What's the matter, you getting soft
in your old age?

703
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,453
Maybe I want to teach the kid a lesson.

704
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,455
- Maybe you like it.
- Maybe I do.

705
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,875
I'm getting sick and tired watching you
being a stooge for Holmes.

706
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,128
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna
see it much longer.

707
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,422
I'm getting sick and tired of it myself.
I'm through, Pete.

708
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,925
Any day now, and I mean it!

709
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:20,053
Listen, if Holmes would let me,
I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.

710
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,138
There's half a dozen companies
in this regiment that'd grab me.

711
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,516
- And in grade, too.
- Oh, sure.

712
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,686
I could be chief of staff, too, only I just
can't think of leaving my old buddies.

713
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,688
Where are you going, Little Sir Echo?

714
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:33,900
To take my shower, if the stinking
First Sergeant has no objections.

715
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,902
Where'd you think?
To the movies in this towel?

716
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,904
Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

717
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,740
I wouldn't drink with you
if it was the last beer in the world.

718
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,408
I'm buying.

719
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,577
That's different.

720
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,919
Wow!

721
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,351
Rose.

722
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,355
You know why I like
to have you serve me beer?

723
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,941
So's I can watch you when you walk away.

724
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:21,364
It's in regulations.
You got a right to complain.

725
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,117
You got a right to take your case
to the inspector general.

726
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,036
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

727
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:30,498
No. I ain't gonna complain.

728
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,792
They ain't gonna get that satisfaction.

729
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:39,215
Believe it or not, this is one soldier
that's got a real big family.

730
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,759
Fifteen of 'em,
'course this is only half of them.

731
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:45,263
You see the gentleman with the handlebars?
That's Mr. Maggio.

732
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,891
Mr. Maggio is my father.

733
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,437
Never saw anybody so stubborn.

734
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,731
How long is it since they
let you go into town?

735
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,233
- Six weeks.
- It's liable to be six years.

736
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,736
How'd you like it,
six years before you see a dame?

737
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,864
Look, why don't you just
mind your own business, huh?

738
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,783
And where did you learn to play the bugle?

739
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,528
That's my buddy boy!

740
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,796
Who's the broad?

741
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,381
My sister.

742
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,977
Maggio, what are you doin'?

743
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,856
- You hit me!
- Yeah, and I'm about to do it again, too.

744
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:25,196
- Why, you dirty wop!
- If you want to fight, take it outside!

745
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,198
I'm gonna cut this wop's heart out.

746
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,034
Anybody steps in here,
I give it to him first.

747
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:35,039
One step further, Fatso,
and I'm gonna de-brain you. I'll kill...

748
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:38,126
Nobody's gonna do nothin'! Anybody
does any killing around here, I'll do it!

749
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,795
- This is a private affair, Warden.
- No, it ain't!

750
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,797
This man's in my company!

751
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,758
You ain't making two extra weeks'
paperwork for me for nothing.

752
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,344
Out for blood, huh?

753
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,430
You'd puke your guts out
at the sight of a dead man.

754
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:53,141
Put down that stool. Put it down!

755
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,732
Drop that knife.

756
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,823
Okay, Fatso,
if it's killing you want, come on.

757
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,869
Well, come on.

758
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,625
On the floor!

759
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:35,975
Killers, huh? I'd trade the pair
of you for a good Camp Fire girl.

760
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,028
Tough monkey.

761
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,782
Guys like you end up
in the stockade sooner or later.

762
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,910
Someday you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.

763
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,912
I'll show you a couple of things.

764
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,892
I'm gonna get a breath of air.

765
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,946
I'm glad he stopped it.

766
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,073
He's a good man.

767
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,177
You keep it.

768
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,221
Keep it for a souvenir.

769
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,723
Okay, I'll keep it.

770
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,893
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?

771
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,733
Prewitt.

772
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:13,281
Could you stand a weekend pass?

773
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,866
Could I...

774
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,119
What about Holmes?

775
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:22,165
Don't worry about Holmes. He signs anything
I put in front of him without reading it.

776
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,584
Sure could use it.

777
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,176
I hear you gone dippy over some dame
down at the New Congress Club.

778
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,554
- What'd you say her name was?
- Lorene.

779
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,681
Beautiful name.

780
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,324
Hey, paisan!

781
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,492
What's holding you up? Let's get going?

782
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,703
What's the matter, buddy boy?
Don't you like it here?

783
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,121
You got something better to do in town?

784
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,957
Look, the bus is leaving right away.
I'm taking the bus, right?

785
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:08,211
Take off. You're talking to a rich man.
I'll hop a taxi.

786
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,296
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.

787
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,308
Maggio, get ready for guard.

788
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,644
Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.

789
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,646
Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.

790
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,439
What? I got a pass!

791
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,150
Not anymore. Anderson's sick.
You're on guard.

792
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,402
I just had guard yesterday. Why me?

793
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:37,156
I'll tell you why you.
You should've gotten dressed faster.

794
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,750
I sure never figured
in your giving me the runaround.

795
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,753
- They didn't even want to let me in this place.
- We're mobbed, that's why.

796
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,422
There's a big crowd from Hickam Field,
and they got in here first.

797
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,424
Anyway, what'd you expect,
a brass band to meet you?

798
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,928
- No. I did think you'd want to see me.
- I'm busy, can't you see?

799
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,389
- Yes, I can see. It's crowded.
- Well, I am.

800
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,686
Look, Maggio's gonna be
at the Kalakaua Inn later.

801
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,729
Ain't there no way you can get out of here?

802
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,023
What's the matter with you?

803
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,193
I work here, you know, after all.
Can't you understand?

804
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:20,533
Yes, I do. I understand.
I understand very well.

805
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:25,121
You haven't been around here in weeks,
and now you turn up all of a sudden and...

806
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,915
Watch it, Mack! Watch where you're going!

807
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,917
Come on out of here.

808
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,013
Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?
I can't just walk out.

809
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,598
And even if I could, she doesn't like us
to see the boys on the outside.

810
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,977
Look, if you feel that way,
just forget about it, okay?

811
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,021
You haven't any claims on me, Mister.

812
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,857
- You're not my husband, you know.
- There you are, Lorene.

813
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,943
I vastly admire your taste, my dear,
but we really need Lorene now.

814
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,779
So many of the gentlemen are unattended.
It is such a rush, isn't it?

815
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,781
- Yeah.
- One might almost mistake us...

816
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,409
For one of those
big political conventions in Philadelphia.

817
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,245
- You are coming, Lorene?
- In a minute.

818
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,168
- I'm sorry.
- How do you think I feel?

819
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:15,421
I may not get another pass for months.

820
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:20,634
I've been counting on this
like a kid counts on Christmas.

821
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,638
But forget it. Forget it. Lorene's busy.
Lorene has got work to do. Lorene's sorry.

822
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,724
Oh, stop calling me Lorene!
My name's Alma!

823
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,768
- Alma?
- Yes, Alma Burke!

824
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,269
Alma?

825
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:37,902
Mrs. Kipfer picked "Lorene"
out of a perfume ad.

826
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,404
She thought it sounded French.

827
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,425
Hey, how'd you get away?

828
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,511
I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.

829
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,180
- But I bet she doesn't believe it.
- I bet she doesn't.

830
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,392
- What'll you have?
- A coke, please.

831
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,852
Yeah, give her a Coke. Big Coke.

832
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,522
It's great you meeting me here, you know?

833
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,732
See, I'm just lucky getting in town.

834
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:20,111
- Topkick gave me a break.
- They still pouring it on?

835
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,988
Holmes and those others,
they really got me on the edge.

836
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,575
- Gee, you must hate the army.
- No, I don't hate the army.

837
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,577
But look what it's doing to you.

838
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,746
I love the army.

839
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,083
But it sure doesn't love you.

840
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,921
A man loves a thing,
that don't mean it's gotta love him back.

841
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,049
Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.

842
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,137
You love a thing,
you've got to be grateful.

843
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:49,098
See, I left home when I was 17.

844
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:54,228
Both my folks is dead, and I didn't belong
no place till I entered the army.

845
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,897
If it weren't for the army,
I wouldn't have learned how to bugle.

846
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,775
- To bugle?
- Yeah.

847
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,028
That's the mouthpiece that I used
when I played a Taps at Arlington.

848
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:09,034
They picked me to play a Taps
at Arlington cemetery on Armistice Day.

849
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,120
The president was there.

850
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,375
I play the bugle well.

851
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,335
Hello, citizens!

852
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:22,631
- Hey, where you been?
- Hi, pals.

853
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,426
I've been in three bars,
and I put a dent in all three of them.

854
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,679
- Yeah, you look it.
- Give me a nail, Prew. I'm hungry for a nail.

855
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,764
What you doing in uniform?

856
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,893
I'm thinking of joining the army.

857
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:36,979
Or maybe I'll go to Mexico
and become a cowboy.

858
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,606
You want to go with me?

859
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:42,318
You keep on drinking,
you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

860
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:46,405
You're absolutely right.
Bartender, whiskey!

861
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,032
Large whiskey.

862
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:52,411
Excuse me. Hey, buddy.

863
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:54,288
Sam!

864
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:59,168
Hey, comin' out, fellas.
The terror of Gimbel's basement.

865
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,796
Stand back there, now. Here we go.
A seven for daddy. Five, deuce.

866
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,633
Hey, seven.

867
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,678
Snake eyes. That's the story of my life.

868
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,436
Hey, Prew, that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
around the corner.

869
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,522
That's where all those movie stars stay.

870
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,526
Listen, paisan, you'd better simmer down.
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

871
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,946
- That's what you say, buddy.
- What do you mean?

872
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,698
- They only gave you an overnight pass?
- No pass.

873
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:34,036
No pass at all. They put me on
guard duty, but old Angelo, he foxed 'em.

874
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,163
You walked off guard?

875
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,541
I checked in,
and I checked right out again.

876
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,710
You get your tail right back to the post.
You're in trouble. You know that.

877
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,380
Hey, hey, Prew, Prew, I got a good idea.

878
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,715
Let's go swimmin'!
We'll go swimming with a movie star.

879
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,093
That's what I'm gonna do,
go swim with a movie star!

880
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,219
Listen, Angelo...

881
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,638
Twenty feet tall!
I'm going swimmin' with a movie star.

882
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,643
You'd better go.

883
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,446
Hey, Angelo.

884
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:15,035
Jerk, get up. Wake up.

885
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,496
I'm awake, I'm awake.
What are you hollering?

886
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,582
Yeah, you're awake.
Put your clothes on, all right?

887
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:23,210
Give them back to the Indians.
The Indians need the clothes.

888
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:26,589
All they wear is G-strings.

889
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:29,925
You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.

890
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:35,598
Hey, I am waiting here for a movie star
to come out of the hotel,

891
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,183
and I am not going until she shows up.

892
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,477
Put your clothes on.

893
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,690
Let's get out of here before
we get in trouble, okay?

894
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,611
What's the matter with you?
Can't a man get drunk?

895
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,155
Can't a man do nothin'?

896
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:57,077
Can't he put his lousy hands
in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

897
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,955
A man gotta be hounded all his life?

898
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,916
Well, I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

899
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:06,003
- I ain't no coward!
- Buddy boy, look.

900
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:10,424
You get dressed, you put your clothes on.

901
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,969
- Will you wait for me? I'll get a cab.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

902
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,680
- Will you wait?
- Yeah, you get a cab.

903
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:35,199
Hey, M.P.s! Come and get me, you guys!

904
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,284
Here I am!

905
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:45,000
Is that the best you can do?
I bet you guys eat Wheaties!

906
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,763
Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?

907
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,016
- It's on right now.
- He'll get the stockade sure.

908
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:05,938
Maybe he won't get it.

909
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,940
All he did was to get drunk.

910
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:12,069
It's a soldier's nature.
It's almost his sacred duty once in a while.

911
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,154
But he walked off guard. He went A.W.O.L.

912
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,824
- What're you hanging around here for?
- Can't a man rest?

913
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,910
What man? You got no work?
Maybe I can scare you up some.

914
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:30,921
Go on and shoot some pool.
Any word comes through, I'll let you know.

915
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,429
Company "G."
First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.

916
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,687
Yes, sir, I'll have his things in order.

917
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,608
He got it. Six months.

918
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,581
I'm gonna escape from this dump.

919
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,167
Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me,
neither can no lousy stockade.

920
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,627
- Shut up.
- Whatever you say, Brownie.

921
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,006
Prisoner, halt!

922
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,108
Hello, tough monkey.

923
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,459
This other girl and I were lucky to rent it.

924
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,669
This is a very fashionable district.

925
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,507
I have another key made for you.

926
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,843
You can use it any time you want to,
even when I'm not here.

927
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

928
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,690
This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.

929
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:16,652
- This is Georgette, my roommate.
- Well, welcome, friend.

930
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,363
There hasn't been a man around the house
since the cat died.

931
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:23,450
I belong to the Book Guild Club.
I always take every book.

932
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,410
That's the way I get all the dividends.

933
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,833
She'll be great for your friend Maggio
when he gets out of the stockade.

934
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,252
Yes, he'll be crazy about her.

935
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,882
Just sit down and get comfortable.

936
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:41,885
I'll make you a martini
and see what's to cook for dinner.

937
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,681
Hey, this is like being married, ain't it?

938
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,766
It's better.

939
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,454
You okay?

940
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,853
Glad you came?

941
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:05,177
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

942
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,090
It can't go on like this much longer.

943
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,302
Even when we sneaked
clear across the island tonight,

944
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:50,639
we had to run out like jailbirds.

945
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,897
If there was only some way we...

946
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,692
Holmes would probably give you a divorce,

947
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:04,236
but he'd never let me
transfer out of his outfit.

948
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,198
There is a way.

949
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,412
I've been thinking about it.
You've got to become an officer.

950
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:17,666
You can take the new extension course,
the one they passed last May.

951
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,835
When you get your commission,
they'd ship you back to the States.

952
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,837
An officer?

953
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:25,841
Yes. Then I could divorce Dana
and marry you.

954
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,552
I hate officers!
I've always hated officers!

955
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,972
Well, that's a fine,
intelligent point of view.

956
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:35,851
Suppose I said I always hated sergeants?
That'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

957
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,604
You sure made a complete study of it.

958
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,152
Okay, suppose I did it.
And don't think it's a cinch.

959
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,571
Then you'd be getting your divorce here
while I was in the States.

960
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,865
We'd be apart maybe six months.
We're sure to be into a war by then.

961
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,867
Why don't you tell the truth?

962
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,036
You just don't want the responsibility.

963
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,038
You're probably not even in love with me.

964
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,123
You're crazy! I wish I didn't love you!

965
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,791
Maybe I could enjoy life again.

966
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,886
So they were married
and lived unhappily ever after.

967
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:16,558
I've never been so miserable in my life
as I have since I met you.

968
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,061
Neither have I.

969
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,480
I wouldn't trade a minute of it.

970
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,023
Neither would I.

971
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,987
I'll probably make the lousiest officer
in this man's army you ever saw.

972
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:32,157
You'll make a fine officer.

973
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,327
A remarkable officer.

974
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,501
Thank you.

975
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,255
Come here.

976
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,010
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

977
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,599
- Honey?
- What?

978
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,476
I want to marry you.

979
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,522
You're a funny one.

980
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,441
Why? Why is it funny
if a guy wants to marry you?

981
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,113
Because I'm a girl you met
at the New Congress Club.

982
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,615
That's about two steps up
from the pavement.

983
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,786
Well, what am I?
I'm a private no-class dogface.

984
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,206
The way most civilians look at that,
that's two steps up from nothing.

985
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,669
Prew, I thought we were happy.

986
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,671
Why do you want to spoil things?

987
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,882
Look,
I've got a year to go before I reenlist.

988
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:35,929
If I can swing sergeant's stripes by then,
they'll let me go back to the States.

989
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,974
Then you and I can
go back there together, if you'll wait.

990
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:42,394
How do you expect to become a sergeant
under that Captain Holmes of yours?

991
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,396
It's all you can do
to keep out of the stockade.

992
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,568
I'll fight.

993
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,320
- No, you're not gonna fight.
- It'd be worth it.

994
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,121
Prew, it's true we love each other now,

995
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,456
we need each other,

996
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,294
but back in the States,
it might be different.

997
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,297
That ain't the real reason.

998
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,094
- All right, it's not.
- What is the real reason?

999
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:23,268
I won't marry you, because I don't want
to be the wife of a soldier.

1000
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,943
Well, that would be about
the best I could ever do for you.

1001
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,659
Because nobody's gonna
stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.

1002
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,703
Because I want to be proper.

1003
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,581
- Proper?
- Yes, proper.

1004
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,418
In another year, I'll have
enough money saved,

1005
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,629
and then I'm gonna go back
to my hometown in Oregon,

1006
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,548
and I'm gonna build a house
for my mother and myself,

1007
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:56,343
and join the country club and take up golf.

1008
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,597
And I'll meet the proper man
with the proper position,

1009
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:06,144
and make a proper wife who can run
a proper home and raise proper children.

1010
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:10,732
And I'll be happy
because when you're proper, you're safe.

1011
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,945
You got guts, honey.

1012
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,989
I hope you can pull it off.

1013
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,667
I do mean it when I say I need you,

1014
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,919
'cause I'm lonely.

1015
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,047
You think I'm lying, don't you?

1016
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,677
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

1017
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,688
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

1018
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:54,192
Why? Because the scandal would spoil
your chances for a promotion?

1019
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,694
I ask you once more.

1020
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,570
I want to know who he is
and where you met him.

1021
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,197
I'm not going to tell you.

1022
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:05,996
One thing I know. I know he's a civilian.
You'd be too discreet to pick an army man.

1023
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,374
I wonder which is hurt more,
your pride or your curiosity?

1024
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,543
You can't expect to know how
I feel about a thing like this.

1025
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,379
I wonder why men feel
so differently about it than women.

1026
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,007
It's just not the same.

1027
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,889
It's a lovely day.
I think I'll go for a walk.

1028
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,060
Hey.

1029
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:35,483
I hear you just got out of the stockade.

1030
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:38,611
It was rugged. I kept my mouth shut,
and I didn't get in no trouble.

1031
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,572
Did you see Maggio?

1032
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,824
Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.

1033
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,035
He's using a billy, too.

1034
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,830
Places where it won't show,
in the back, in the chest.

1035
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,915
He's got it down to a system.

1036
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,584
He kicks him a lot, too.

1037
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,920
You know how Maggio's taking it?

1038
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:59,883
He just keeps spittin' in Fatso's eye.

1039
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,926
Ain't he a hot one?

1040
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,846
He's a good man.

1041
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,975
Well, Fatso can't make a dent in him.

1042
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,186
But that Fatso, he's smart.

1043
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,313
He makes sure the O.D. never sees nothing.

1044
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,440
Why doesn't Maggio go to the O.D. himself?

1045
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,942
We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.

1046
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,195
That boy's about
the toughest nut in the woods.

1047
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,530
You think he's gonna be all right, huh?

1048
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:26,159
- Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.
- What do you mean?

1049
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:29,913
After Fatso threw him in the hole,
that's solitary,

1050
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:33,666
he started talking a couple of times
about how he's gonna escape.

1051
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,169
He said to tell you
he'll look you up one of these nights.

1052
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,924
Still on your knees, huh, Prewitt?

1053
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:44,636
Well, boxing finals next month.
December 15th.

1054
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,305
You've still got time
to help us win the championship.

1055
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:52,310
Are you proud to be in this company or not?

1056
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:02,904
I ain't gonna move around you again.

1057
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,907
Something tells me
you need a lesson, Prewitt.

1058
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,992
Maybe I'll give it to you myself.

1059
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,582
Come on, leave him alone, Ike.
He's in my detail now.

1060
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,793
You're gonna get in trouble
if you fight around here.

1061
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,170
- Get back to work, Prew.
- Get out of the way!

1062
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,828
I'll be glad to put
my recommendation on that, Warden.

1063
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,997
You've got service, experience, grade.

1064
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,624
- You'll make an excellent officer.
- Thank you, sir.

1065
01:19:56,709 --> 01:20:00,378
It'd be a feather in my cap, too.
A man from my company.

1066
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,048
At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?

1067
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:07,469
They're fighting outside, sir.
Galovitch and Prewitt.

1068
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,678
Prewitt?

1069
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,222
Galovitch looks like
he's gonna murder him, sir.

1070
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,433
I'll take care of it.

1071
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:21,232
- Don't you want to see?
- No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!

1072
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,242
Why don't Prew go for his head?

1073
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,828
He blinded a guy once.
Must be scared of the same thing.

1074
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:44,172
The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!

1075
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,778
- Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!
- I'll fight any way I want!

1076
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,448
Come on, Prew! Get him!

1077
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,733
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

1078
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:48,319
- What's his name, Major?
- Captain Holmes, sir.

1079
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,473
Ten-hut!

1080
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:19,642
At ease. What started this?

1081
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:23,771
Prewitt refused order I gave him,
talked back and started a fight.

1082
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,773
I taught him a lesson.

1083
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,234
You won't disobey
any more orders in my company, Prewitt.

1084
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:33,281
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, but Private Prewitt's not
to blame, Sergeant Galovitch started it.

1085
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,741
- Thornhill.
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,826
You're in charge of this detail.
What about it?

1087
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,828
He's right, sir. Prewitt done nothing.

1088
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:41,205
Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.

1089
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,668
That's all. Let's forget it.
Let's get back to our jobs.

1090
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:49,756
All right, back to work.
Let's go. Break it up.

1091
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:56,471
If you guys think this means
I'm stepping into a ring, you're wrong.

1092
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:59,098
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

1093
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:15,490
Took my dough to town Tuesday

1094
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,743
Found me a big feather bed

1095
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:23,081
Oh, a big feather bed
A big double bed

1096
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:26,501
I'll find a job tomorrow

1097
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:29,337
Tonight I'll sleep like I'm dead

1098
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:34,050
I'm gonna sleep like I'm dead

1099
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:37,428
And get up when I choose

1100
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:40,682
Reenlistment blues

1101
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:44,185
Hey, Friday.

1102
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:47,105
- Why are you called Friday?
- I don't know.

1103
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,732
But I was born on a Wednesday.

1104
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:53,277
I hit the bars Wednesday

1105
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:57,865
Made me some friends on my own

1106
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:01,452
Lotta friends on my own

1107
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,789
Found a pretty baby

1108
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,917
She couldn't leave me alone

1109
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,461
Oh, leave me alone

1110
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:15,508
She kept me buyin' booze

1111
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:18,136
Reenlistment blues

1112
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:21,848
Reenlistment blues

1113
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,685
I had the misery Thursday

1114
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:29,188
The walls was movin' I swear

1115
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:33,651
Oh, they was movin' I swear

1116
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:37,029
I reached down in my trousers

1117
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,949
And all my pockets was bare

1118
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:48,082
That gal was sure bad news

1119
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:51,002
Reenlistment blues

1120
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,304
Hey, Prewitt, where you going?

1121
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:03,723
What do you mean, where am I going?
I'm going to Choy's.

1122
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,850
I'm gonna get me another beer.

1123
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,648
My hitch was up Monday

1124
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:15,610
Not a dog soldier no more

1125
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:19,113
I ain't a soldier no more

1126
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:21,491
Halt!

1127
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,579
- Who goes there?
- A friend.

1128
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,165
Advance, friend, and be recognized!

1129
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,219
Ten-hut!

1130
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:44,138
Right face! Rear face!

1131
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:47,225
On your knees! Scrub the floor!

1132
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,185
At ease.

1133
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:55,858
Hello, kid.
What are you doing out here all by yourself?

1134
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:02,448
- I'm gonna get a little drink.
- Sit down. I got a bottle.

1135
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,498
Thanks, Top.

1136
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:17,004
I gotta hand it to you, kid, the way you
beat up old Galovitch this afternoon.

1137
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:20,007
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

1138
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:30,810
Life's crummy, you know it?

1139
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:34,397
Yes, sir, it's miserable.
Perfectly miserable.

1140
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,149
What do you suppose would happen,

1141
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:40,152
if a truck was to come along
and run us over?

1142
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:44,991
- We'd be dead.
- You'd better not sit here anymore.

1143
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:47,577
You'd better get up
and sit over on the side of the road.

1144
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,371
What? What do you mean, I better?

1145
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:54,834
You've got more to live for than I do.
You got your whole company to take care of.

1146
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,919
You move over, move over
to the other side of the road.

1147
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:59,964
- Go on.
- I'm older! It don't matter if I die.

1148
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,216
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
Now, don't argue.

1149
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:04,510
- Go on, get up.
- No, sir, not Prewitt.

1150
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:07,722
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

1151
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:13,477
Okay, we'll stay together.

1152
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:19,984
I don't... I couldn't have got up anyway.

1153
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:27,325
I got the biggest troubles
in the whole world.

1154
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:30,494
In the whole world, huh?

1155
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,413
Take love.

1156
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:35,917
Did you personally ever see any of this love?

1157
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:38,836
You'll understand what I mean.

1158
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:41,297
This girl, see,

1159
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:44,091
she wants me to become...

1160
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,761
- Become what?
- An officer.

1161
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,221
Can you see me as an officer?

1162
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,850
Yeah. Yeah, I can see you as an officer.

1163
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:57,605
- You'd be a good officer.
- Well, you both can see more than I can see.

1164
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,900
I don't wanna be an officer.
I'm happy where I am.

1165
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,780
I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

1166
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,533
You wouldn't want me
to be a guy like Holmes, would you?

1167
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:12,662
Well, would you?

1168
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,624
A man should be what he can do.

1169
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,012
How's your girl?

1170
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,932
What's her name again?

1171
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,853
- Lorene.
- Oh, yeah, Lorene.

1172
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,022
I remember now.

1173
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,775
A beautiful name.

1174
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:45,027
Beautiful.

1175
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,035
You two dumb, crazy screwballs!

1176
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,246
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

1177
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,248
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

1178
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,710
My friend Prew and I,
sittin' here discussin' the weather.

1179
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:02,920
- Your friend, huh?
- You heard me.

1180
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:05,673
Don't you know
you gotta take care of this man?

1181
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:09,051
Holmes is bound to get him sooner or later.

1182
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:11,804
And he's the best stinkin' soldier
in the whole army.

1183
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,098
You both got rocks in your head.

1184
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:20,646
Angelo, Angelo.

1185
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,278
I figured you'd be here at Choy's.

1186
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:32,116
I done it, Prew.
I escaped, just like I said.

1187
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:34,160
Just like I figured.

1188
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:37,329
In the back of a truck, under a tarp.

1189
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:41,459
They rode me right out,
just like I figured.

1190
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:45,296
Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,
about a mile back,

1191
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,631
and I fell out in the road.

1192
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:53,262
You should've seen me bounce.
I must've broke something.

1193
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:00,019
Prew. Prew, listen.

1194
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,606
Fatso done it, Prew.

1195
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,108
He likes to whack me in the gut.

1196
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:10,905
He asks me if it hurts,
and I spit at him like always.

1197
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:14,617
Only yesterday, it was bad.

1198
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:18,537
He hit me, he hit me, he hit me.

1199
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:23,501
I had to get out, Prew. I had to get out.

1200
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,878
Buddy, buddy.

1201
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:27,797
They gonna send you to the stockade, Prew?

1202
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,590
No, they ain't gonna send me
to the stockade.

1203
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,342
Watch out for Fatso.

1204
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,344
Watch out for Fatso.

1205
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,429
He'll try to crack you.

1206
01:30:35,514 --> 01:30:39,141
And if they put you in the hole,
don't yell.

1207
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:41,435
Don't make a sound.

1208
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:45,356
You'll still be yelling
when they come to take you out.

1209
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:48,567
Just lay there.

1210
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,571
Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.

1211
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,046
He's dead.

1212
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:41,453
I'll betcha that's Prewitt.

1213
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,848
Sergeant Judson?

1214
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,891
You want me?

1215
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,060
Yeah, Fatso.

1216
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,646
I don't like that nickname.

1217
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:15,399
You want to see me about something?

1218
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,360
Let's step around the corner
where we can talk.

1219
01:34:19,446 --> 01:34:21,071
Okay.

1220
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:36,003
- Are you sore about something?
- I don't like the way you play the piano.

1221
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,592
- Remember Maggio?
- Oh, the wop?

1222
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,677
Yeah, a real tough monkey.

1223
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:46,138
- You killed him.
- Did I?

1224
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:48,140
Well, if I did, he asked for it.

1225
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:51,310
The army's gonna get you
sooner or later, Fatso.

1226
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:55,147
But before they do,
I want a piece of you myself.

1227
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:59,193
I figured that.

1228
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:01,195
See this knife?

1229
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,739
It's the one you pulled on Maggio.

1230
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,667
Prew!

1231
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,462
What's...

1232
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,216
Prew!

1233
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,428
It's all right.

1234
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:55,434
Don't worry, don't worry.
I ain't gonna die.

1235
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,912
First platoon all present and accounted for!

1236
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:16,914
Second platoon all present
and accounted for!

1237
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,999
First platoon all present and accounted for!

1238
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,001
Second platoon all present
and accounted for!

1239
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,212
Third platoon all present and accounted for!

1240
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:25,506
First platoon all present and accounted for!

1241
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,967
Company dismissed!

1242
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:35,390
Prewitt's still absent.

1243
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:38,310
Makes three days now.

1244
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:43,857
How long are you gonna
carry him present, Top?

1245
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,277
- I just mention it.
- Well, don't mention it.

1246
01:37:54,661 --> 01:37:56,578
"Upon observing these incidents,

1247
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:59,373
"an investigation was made
by the Inspector General's department

1248
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,708
"over a period of several months.

1249
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:05,420
"It was found that Captain Holmes
has been guilty of indefensible cruelty

1250
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:07,464
"to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

1251
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:11,677
"As mentioned, this included the instigation
of wholly unauthorized tactics

1252
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:15,389
"to force the soldier to join
the inter-regiment boxing team."

1253
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:22,688
I'm waiting for your reply.

1254
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:24,356
I haven't any, sir.

1255
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:28,402
Holmes,
the first thing I learned in the army

1256
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:31,196
was that an officer takes care of his men.

1257
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:34,074
It seems to be the first thing that you forgot.

1258
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:36,827
My only regret is that
we have to keep you in uniform

1259
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:38,912
until a court-martial is concluded.

1260
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:42,457
If there were any way
to avoid a court-martial, sir.

1261
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,588
There is one alternative, General,
if you are so disposed.

1262
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:52,718
A resignation for the good of the service,
under army regulations.

1263
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:56,930
Write a letter of resignation.
Have it on my desk this afternoon.

1264
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:58,932
As far as I'm concerned,

1265
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:01,893
the quicker you're out of the army,
the better for everybody,

1266
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:04,021
especially the army.

1267
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:07,774
That's all, Holmes.

1268
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:17,200
I know what's been going on in this outfit.

1269
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:19,661
I know how far some of you
have been out of line.

1270
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:22,998
If you want to remain noncoms,
you'd better snap into it.

1271
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,459
And another thing, from now on,

1272
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:28,211
no man's gonna earn his stripes by boxing.

1273
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,133
- Get rid of those.
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,135
Dismissed.

1275
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,976
- About Sergeant Galovitch.
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:45,812
Bust him.
Sergeant Galovitch is now Private Galovitch.

1277
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:48,148
Put him in charge of the latrine.

1278
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:50,150
What are you grinning at?

1279
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,944
I think the company commander
made a wise decision, sir.

1280
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:57,908
Company "G," Captain Ross.

1281
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:03,080
- Just a minute. It's for you, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

1282
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,585
Yes, sir?

1283
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:13,507
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

1284
01:40:14,801 --> 01:40:16,009
What?

1285
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,929
I've got to see you, Milt. It's important.

1286
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:26,103
Okay, I'll get away somehow.
Sure, that'd be fine.

1287
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:29,606
Yeah. I'll be there in about an hour.

1288
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:30,982
Right.

1289
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:36,321
He's being sent back to the States.
He's sailing next week.

1290
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:39,449
He wants me to go with him. What'll we do?

1291
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:44,162
When do you think
you'll get your commission?

1292
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,418
I didn't put it in.

1293
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,670
I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.

1294
01:40:51,838 --> 01:40:55,674
I took it out of my desk a dozen times,
but I couldn't sign it.

1295
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:57,718
Why?

1296
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:00,971
But it was the plan.

1297
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:03,390
- I know, I know.
- It's been weeks.

1298
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,684
You can't just say you'll do a thing
and then not do it.

1299
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:07,060
Karen, listen to me.

1300
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:09,980
But why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you tell me?

1301
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,483
Be back in a minute.

1302
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:18,822
I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

1303
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:28,665
I thought it was a guy from our company,
Prewitt, the kid I was telling you about.

1304
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:31,543
The one that got mixed up with
one of the girls at the New Congress Club.

1305
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:34,963
He's A.W.O.L. Probably in lots of trouble.

1306
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:37,883
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no good...

1307
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:44,681
Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.

1308
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:45,891
I can't be anything else.

1309
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:48,185
If I try to be an officer,
I'll be putting on an act.

1310
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:51,188
I just can't do it.
Please don't ask me why.

1311
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:56,234
I know why.

1312
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,403
You don't have to become
an officer now, Milt,

1313
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,031
now that Dana's out of the army.

1314
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,658
You just don't want to marry me.

1315
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:06,411
You're already married to the army.

1316
01:42:06,496 --> 01:42:08,497
I love you, Karen.

1317
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,712
I know. I know.

1318
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,966
I don't want you to go back to Holmes.

1319
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,427
I don't want to either, but I am.

1320
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:25,138
There's nothing else for me to do.

1321
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:28,141
It's no good with us, Milt.
It could never have been any good.

1322
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:30,310
Hiding and sneaking.

1323
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:32,354
It had to wear out.

1324
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:37,567
Goodbye, Sergeant.

1325
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:40,821
- Thanks.
- It ain't goodbye. It's...

1326
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:44,616
We'll see each other again somewhere.

1327
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:47,452
Of course we will.

1328
01:42:47,829 --> 01:42:49,663
Somewhere.

1329
01:43:03,553 --> 01:43:07,889
Here it is.
Got it on an inside page already.

1330
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:13,061
"Still no clue in the fatal stabbing
of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson."

1331
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,272
Did you hear me?

1332
01:43:18,776 --> 01:43:22,153
- Trying to set a new world's record?
- Yeah.

1333
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:25,615
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

1334
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:29,369
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt,

1335
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:32,539
holder of the new world's record.

1336
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,851
- Everything all right, Top?
- Great.

1337
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:56,396
This is a beautiful meal
to put in front of a guy on a Sunday morning.

1338
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,316
Congratulations.

1339
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:16,666
- Sure look pretty over them mountains.
- Don't they, though?

1340
01:44:26,135 --> 01:44:28,762
Sounds like they're dynamiting
down at Wheeler Field.

1341
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:33,308
Mighty ambitious, huh?
Sunday morning before 8:00?

1342
01:44:44,946 --> 01:44:48,406
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!

1343
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:50,825
I seen the red circles on the...

1344
01:45:22,066 --> 01:45:24,693
Come on, get inside! Hurry up! Go!

1345
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:33,451
This is a real attack, not a maneuver.
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.

1346
01:45:33,536 --> 01:45:37,497
Please keep in your homes.
Do not go on the streets. This is a real attack.

1347
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,875
Japanese planes are bombing our naval
and army installations.

1348
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,587
All right, all right, you guys, quiet down.

1349
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:46,589
Quiet! Quiet down!

1350
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,926
Noncoms, get B.A.R.s
and ammunition from the supply room.

1351
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:51,886
- Get up on the roof. Henderson.
- Right here, Sarge.

1352
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:53,972
You're in charge of the loading detail.
Get moving.

1353
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:55,390
Wilson, Dole, let's go.

1354
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:57,392
The rest of you men, listen to me.

1355
01:45:57,476 --> 01:45:59,936
I want every man to get his rifle,
go to his bunk and stay there.

1356
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:01,354
And I mean stay there!

1357
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:04,983
Shut up!

1358
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:07,736
You'll get your ears shot off
if you go outside.

1359
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,738
You wanna be heroes,
you'll get plenty of chances.

1360
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,781
There'll probably be Japs
in your lap before night.

1361
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:14,075
Now get moving. We're wasting time.

1362
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,411
Hey, come on. Hurry up.

1363
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:19,539
Wait. Into the kitchen
and make a pot of coffee.

1364
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:22,292
- Wait a minute. A barrel of coffee!
- Right, Sarge!

1365
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,230
I don't care.
I can't issue any live ammunitions

1366
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:45,565
without a signed order from an officer.

1367
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,484
- But the captain ain't here, you jerk!
- I'm sorry.

1368
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:49,444
- No order, no ammo.
- What's the matter, Leva?

1369
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,489
I got my orders!
Army regulations say that I can't give out...

1370
01:46:57,995 --> 01:46:59,621
What's the matter, are you blind?
Give me them keys!

1371
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:00,789
I obey my orders, Top.

1372
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,874
Okay, I'll see you get a medal!
Bust it down, boys!

1373
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,876
I warned ya!

1374
01:47:28,234 --> 01:47:30,151
Don't go out there, Warden!
You'll get killed!

1375
01:47:30,236 --> 01:47:32,946
Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!

1376
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,600
Give him a hand with this ammo.
Put that stuff over there.

1377
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:11,234
Watch your fire, boys,
and lead those planes!

1378
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:34,716
Friday's gone crazy!
He's blowing the cavalry charge!

1379
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,387
Here they come, boys!

1380
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,588
You got him, Pete! You got him!

1381
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,340
I got him?

1382
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:26,309
The danger of an invasion
continues to exist.

1383
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:29,520
Infantry units from Schofield Barracks
moved out within a few hours

1384
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:31,731
and have manned beach positions.

1385
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:35,443
This is no maneuver.
This is the real McCoy.

1386
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:38,905
Look out for falling shrapnel.
Keep under cover.

1387
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:42,659
Blackout and curfew restrictions
will be rigidly enforced.

1388
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:45,495
Stay in your homes.
Don't use the telephone.

1389
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:48,915
Rest assured that immediate relay to you...

1390
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:52,585
Prew! We've been to Queen's Hospital
giving blood.

1391
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:53,878
The town's a madhouse.

1392
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:55,964
There's a big house bombed out
on Kuhio Street.

1393
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:58,675
And the drugstore down
on McCully and King is smashed flat.

1394
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:02,095
- Man and his wife were killed.
- Your attention, please.

1395
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:04,889
Listen to this carefully and keep calm.

1396
01:50:04,974 --> 01:50:08,434
The danger of an invasion continues to exist,

1397
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:12,230
and the planes have been
identified as Japanese.

1398
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,983
Who do they think they're fighting?

1399
01:50:15,442 --> 01:50:18,987
They're picking trouble
with the best army in the world.

1400
01:50:20,281 --> 01:50:21,531
Where are you going?

1401
01:50:22,574 --> 01:50:25,743
I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to the company.

1402
01:50:25,828 --> 01:50:29,956
- The company? But why?
- Why?

1403
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:33,042
But you can't. You're not well yet.

1404
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:36,629
Besides, you're A.W.O.L.
They'll throw you in the stockade.

1405
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:38,715
They'll be throwing them out of the stockade.

1406
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:41,718
- They need every guy they can get.
- But your side'll open up.

1407
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:44,679
They'll find out it was you
who killed that soldier.

1408
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:48,057
Once I report in to the company,
they'll take care of me.

1409
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,976
I'll be all right once I get back.

1410
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:53,438
But you'll never make it!
There's patrols all over!

1411
01:50:53,522 --> 01:50:56,607
I'll make it. I know a shortcut.

1412
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:01,070
Prew, stay till morning.

1413
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:03,906
Maybe if you stay till morning,
you'll change your mind.

1414
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:13,333
Oh, Prew, don't go!

1415
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,501
I'll do anything you want.

1416
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:20,006
We can go back to the States together.
We can even get married.

1417
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:26,721
If you go now,
I'll never see you again, I know it.

1418
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:28,598
I'm sorry.

1419
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:36,356
What do you want to go back
to the army for?

1420
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,192
What did the army ever
do for you besides treat you like dirt

1421
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:42,862
and give you one awful going-over
and get your friend killed?

1422
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:45,406
What do you want to go back to the army for?

1423
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:48,201
What do I want to go back to the army for?
I'm a soldier.

1424
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:50,286
A soldier? A soldier?

1425
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:54,082
A regular! From the regular army!
A 30-year man!

1426
01:51:56,126 --> 01:52:00,171
I gotta turn off the lights
'cause of the blackout outside.

1427
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:16,521
They say they've seen parachutists
land up in the hills.

1428
01:52:16,605 --> 01:52:19,982
I ain't worried about them.
Saboteurs is what worries me.

1429
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:22,985
Yeah. I bet they're operating
all over these islands.

1430
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:38,478
Halt!

1431
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:42,398
Halt!

1432
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,243
Halt!

1433
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:10,801
My hitch was up Monday

1434
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:14,555
Not a dog soldier no more

1435
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:18,601
Soldier no more

1436
01:54:19,937 --> 01:54:23,856
They give me all that money

1437
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:27,693
So much my pockets is sore

1438
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:32,698
Do you know this man, Sergeant?

1439
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:34,700
Yes, sir.

1440
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:36,911
He didn't have any regular identification.

1441
01:54:36,995 --> 01:54:39,497
They found a card on him with his name.

1442
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:41,707
Seems to be a membership in a club.

1443
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,876
- The New Congress Club.
- Yes, sir.

1444
01:54:43,961 --> 01:54:46,128
You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.

1445
01:54:50,634 --> 01:54:53,511
- Was this man a friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

1446
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:56,347
He must've been trying to reach our
company position up the beach here.

1447
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:57,890
Then why didn't he halt?

1448
01:54:57,975 --> 01:55:01,060
He was always a hardhead, sir,
but he was a good soldier.

1449
01:55:01,144 --> 01:55:03,938
He loved the army
more than any soldier I ever knew.

1450
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:07,817
I see. I'm sorry, Sergeant.

1451
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:25,793
You just couldn't play it smart, could you?

1452
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:30,006
All you had to do was box.
But no, not you, you hardhead.

1453
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:35,094
Funny thing is, there ain't gonna be
any boxing championships this year.

1454
01:55:42,519 --> 01:55:44,895
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you ever seen a dead man?

1455
01:55:45,022 --> 01:55:48,149
Let's get this body outta here!
We ain't got all night!

1456
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:12,131
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

1457
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:20,139
I think it's the most beautiful place
I ever saw in my life.

1458
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:24,310
I can almost see where I worked from here.

1459
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,232
There's a legend.

1460
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:35,655
If they float in toward shore,
you'll come back someday.

1461
01:56:36,073 --> 01:56:38,074
If they float out to sea, you won't.

1462
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,498
I won't come back.

1463
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:51,087
You see, my fianc was
killed on December 7th.

1464
01:56:51,171 --> 01:56:53,214
Oh, I'm sorry.

1465
01:56:53,423 --> 01:56:55,800
He was a bomber pilot.

1466
01:56:55,884 --> 01:56:58,928
He tried to taxi his plane
to the edge of the apron,

1467
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:02,348
and the Japs made a direct hit on it.

1468
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:05,518
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

1469
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:08,270
He was awarded the silver star.

1470
01:57:08,897 --> 01:57:11,148
They sent it to his mother.

1471
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,484
She wrote me she wanted me to have it.

1472
01:57:14,152 --> 01:57:16,153
That's very fine of her.

1473
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:20,116
They're very fine people. Southern people.

1474
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:23,869
He was named after a general.

1475
01:57:23,954 --> 01:57:27,623
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

1476
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:30,793
Who?

1477
01:57:32,212 --> 01:57:35,464
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

1478
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:41,971
Isn't that a silly old name?
