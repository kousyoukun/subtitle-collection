1
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:49,630
One, two, three, four.

2
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,148
Hey, Maggio! Hello!

3
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,147
Hiya, Prew.

4
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:47,152
What are you doing over here?

5
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:49,485
Transferred over from Fort Shafter.

6
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,196
-You quit the Bugle Corps?
-Yup.

7
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,658
For here?

8
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,456
l didn't pick it.

9
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,784
You made a very bad mistake.

10
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,207
This outfit, they can give back Custer.

11
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:01,245
Yeah?

12
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:07,717
Captain ain't in yet.

13
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,972
l'll look around.

14
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,739
What do you think you're doing?

15
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:36,498
-What's your name?
-Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

16
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,739
l heard about you.

17
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,370
l heard about you, too, Sergeant.

18
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,415
This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.

19
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:47,258
You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself
before sundown.

20
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,715
Put up your cue and come along.

21
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:02,354
Grand went to the hospital yesterday.
You put him in the sick book?

22
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,063
-Didn't have time.
-You're the company clerk, Ma<i>zz</i>ioli.

23
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,735
The medics returned the sick book
late yesterday. l'll do it now.

24
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:11,361
Thanks, l already done it for you.

25
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,619
You're the best bugler
they got over at Shafter.

26
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,327
-You're the best bugler on this island.
-That's true.

27
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,833
l feel for you, pal.

28
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:30,044
But from my position,
l can't quite reach you.

29
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,673
Ten-hut!

30
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,302
At ease.

31
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,271
-'Morning, sir.
-'Morning, men.

32
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,813
Anything special for me?
l've only a few minutes.

33
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,941
Yes, sir. New man here.

34
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,855
Oh, yes. Come in.

35
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,446
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, reporting
to the Company Commander, as ordered.

36
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,328
At ease. Where's that service record?

37
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:08,464
''Born in Kentucky.
Enlisted first at Fort Meyer, Virginia.

38
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,707
''Bugle Corps, First Bugler.''

39
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,428
Prewitt, l always make it a policy
to talk to my new men.

40
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,673
Now, l have a fine, smooth-running outfit.

41
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,180
lf l like a soldier, he can become
a non-commissioned officer quickly.

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,849
But he has to show me
that he's got it on the ball.

43
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,064
What trouble were you in,
in the Bugle Corps?

44
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,231
No trouble, sir.

45
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:31,022
What made you transfer out, then?

46
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:33,819
lt was a personal matter.

47
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:37,284
-Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
-Why, yes, sir.

48
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,783
Prewitt, you was a corporal
in the Bugle Corps.

49
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:44,415
You took a bust to buck private
to transfer to an infantry outfit. Why?

50
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:48,084
Because you like to hike, or was it
because you couldn't stand to bugle?

51
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,173
lt was a personal matter.

52
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:53,004
That's up to the Company Commander
to decide.

53
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:54,125
Well?

54
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,552
l was First Bugler for two years.

55
00:04:57,723 --> 00:05:00,890
The Top Kick had a friend
who transferred in from another outfit.

56
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,349
The next day he was made
First Bugler over me.

57
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,349
l was a better bugler.

58
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,144
And you asked out on account of that?

59
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:11,529
Maybe it ain't sensible,
but that's the reason.

60
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,530
His feelings were hurt.
Kids they send us now!

61
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:18,322
We'll get your stripes back for you,
maybe an extra one for good measure.

62
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,699
-Know why you're assigned to G Company?
-No, sir.

63
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,828
l pulled a few strings. l'm the regimental
boxing coach, you know.

64
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,747
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:30,922
l saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl
year before last. You should have won.

66
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:32,038
Thank you, sir.

67
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:36,469
Our regiment got beaten in the finals
last December, but l mean to win this year.

68
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:38,463
All l've needed is a top middleweight.

69
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,890
l'm sorry, sir. l quit fighting.

70
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,467
Quit fighting? When? What for?

71
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,764
Well, over a year ago.

72
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,140
Maybe you heard about what happened
with Dixie Wells?

73
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:54,482
-You mean that fellow that got hurt?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,363
Yes, l heard about that. lt's too bad.

75
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:59,153
l can understand how you feel,
but those things happen.

76
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,319
That's why l decided l would quit, sir.

77
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:05,073
You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed.

78
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,831
Our fighting programme
is the best morale builder we have.

79
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:20,300
l've got a mighty sour company bugler.
How'd you like the job?

80
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,547
Not if it means fighting.

81
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:26,593
Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire
a reputation as a lone wolf.

82
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:31,475
You should know that in the Army
it's not the individual that counts.

83
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:35,268
You'll find that we won't put
any pressure on you in my outfit.

84
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:38,613
Just don't make any mistakes in it,
that's all.

85
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:41,239
l'm going to town.
Anything else, Sergeant?

86
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,366
Company fund report's due tomorrow.

87
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:46,123
-You make it out. ls that all?
-No, sir.

88
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:48,246
Whatever it is, you fix it up.

89
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,955
lf anything has to go in this afternoon,
sign my name.

90
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,251
-l won't be back.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:59,635
He'd strangle in his own spit
if l wasn't here to swab his throat out.

92
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:02,128
Come on.

93
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,605
You been in the Army what now?
Five years? Five and a half?

94
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:17,727
Yeah.

95
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:20,941
Don't you think it's about time
you got smart?

96
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,321
You know what you did just now,
turning down Dynamite Holmes?

97
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,121
You put your head in the noose.

98
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,240
Things are soft for a boxer in this outfit.

99
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,326
Otherwise, you better know how to soldier.

100
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,542
l can soldier with any man.

101
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:49,800
This place is getting to be like
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

102
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:56,859
-Who's that?
-She's Captain Holmes' wife.

103
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:02,323
You'll fight, Prewitt, because
Captain Holmes wants to be Major Holmes.

104
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:05,528
He's got an idea he'll make it
if he gets a winning team.

105
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:07,784
lf you don't do it for him, do it for me.

106
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,781
'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?

107
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:14,417
More he's happy, the less he bothers me,
and the better l run this company.

108
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,251
So, we know where we stand,
don't we, kid?

109
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,709
l know where l stand.
A man don't go his own way he's nothing.

110
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:25,839
Maybe back in the days of the pioneers
a man could go his own way.

111
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:28,304
But today, you got to play ball.

112
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,221
Leva!

113
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:38,566
Can't l once find you in the supply room
working with both hands?

114
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,226
l can't do no better
on what you people pay me.

115
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,114
Draw this man some supplies.

116
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:46,865
G Company squad room is on the top floor.
Take your bags then come here.

117
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:51,413
Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.
Save you making four or five trips.

118
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:52,530
Thanks.

119
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,919
l just hate to see energy wasted.
Besides, you'll be needing yours.

120
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:01,666
Looks like a good man.

121
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,833
l know his type. He's a hardhead.

122
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:17,853
Her and them sweaters.

123
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,561
l'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.

124
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:24,070
Not her, Top. She knows the score.
Like l been telling you.

125
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,698
ls that right?

126
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:30,903
Not around here, but when l soldiered
at Fort Bliss, l heard plenty about this lady.

127
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,240
-You did?
-Okay, not me.

128
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:36,867
But l know some of the guys
she played around with, so don't tell me.

129
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,712
l'm not telling you. You're telling me.

130
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,252
-Good morning, Sergeant.
-'Morning, ma'am.

131
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:48,509
l'm looking for my husband.

132
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:51,297
Captain Holmes just went into town.
On business.

133
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:54,851
He was to have left some things for me.
Do you know about them?

134
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:57,892
No, l don't, ma'am.
Anything l can do for you?

135
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,976
No, thanks.

136
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,559
l'd be glad to help, ma'am.

137
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:15,406
My husband's been telling me
a lot about you, Sergeant.

138
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:17,035
He says you're very efficient.

139
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,991
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:22,042
What is it that makes you
so efficient, Sergeant?

141
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,792
l was born smart, ma'am.

142
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,212
l love that.

143
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,255
Well, good-bye, Sergeant.

144
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:35,766
Man, she sure is one, ain't she?

145
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:37,016
One what?

146
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,385
One woman.

147
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,189
l've seen better.

148
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,527
Karen?

149
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,743
-Sorry l'm late.
-lt doesn't matter.

150
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:07,748
l got tied up with General Slater.
l bumped into him in the Officers' Club.

151
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:10,595
Yeah? What did the General have to say?

152
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,387
Success, he said.

153
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:15,343
Success in war, success in peacetime.

154
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:18,264
Not a word about my promotion.

155
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:21,647
Sometimes l think the old man's
just waiting to ship me down.

156
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:24,603
Less time buttering generals
and more with your company...

157
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:29,237
-...maybe you'd get that promotion.
-The company takes care of itself.

158
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:32,194
l went over there today looking for you.

159
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:35,535
l had some business to attend to
at Kaneohe.

160
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,120
That was all right, wasn't it?

161
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,582
Of course.

162
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,328
l've no right to inquire into your actions.
That was our agreement.

163
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:44,796
Then why bring it up?

164
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,830
Because l wanted you to know l'm not
as stupid as you maintain all women are.

165
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:50,586
Now, just what does that mean?

166
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,172
What are you accusing me of now?

167
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:53,342
Of nothing.

168
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:56,515
lt's no longer my business
how many women you go out with.

169
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,637
But l wish you could just be honest
about it once.

170
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:02,302
No reason l should try to hide anything,
is there...

171
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:04,936
...the way things are between us now?

172
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:08,437
What right have you
to always be accusing me?

173
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:10,268
What right?

174
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:15,733
Are you going back to that again?

175
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:19,576
How long will it be, l wonder,
before l'm allowed to live that down?

176
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,955
How many times must l say
it was an accident?

177
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,501
Please, Dana.

178
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:26,702
l'm going to bed.

179
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,753
Please get out of my bedroom.

180
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:01,244
Captain Holmes says you don't want
to come out and fight for us.

181
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:02,577
That's right.

182
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,917
We thought we'd buy you a beer
and talk it over.

183
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:07,785
We're the company boxers.

184
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,174
l figured.

185
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,102
What l wouldn't give to have this guy
in a corner poolroom in my hometown!

186
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,110
lf you box as good as you used to,
we'd be a cinch this year.

187
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:36,657
You ain't forget, division champs
get ten-day furloughs, did you, son?

188
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:43,954
l'm lke Galovitch.
Platoon guide of your platoon.

189
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,532
And don't think
you're a tough guy, Prewitt.

190
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:50,292
You no talk now, but out in the field
with us you sing different song.

191
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,631
He don't have to fight if he don't want
without being kicked around.

192
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,260
We're playing pool. Take off.

193
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:57,052
-You want busted head, Maggio?
-No.

194
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:59,463
Then keep your big nose out altogether.

195
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:01,964
Training starts next week.
Pick up your stuff--

196
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,808
Look, l told Holmes and l'm telling you...

197
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:09,980
...l ain't fighting. l quit fighting!

198
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:13,357
You guys want to put the screws on,
go right ahead.

199
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:15,771
l can take anything you can dish out.

200
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:17,407
Okay, Prewitt.

201
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,160
Thanks.

202
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,745
l just hate to see a good guy
get it in the gut.

203
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,499
You'd better get used to it, kid.

204
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:36,757
You'll probably see a lot of it
before you die.

205
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:45,685
You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?

206
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,851
You know anything in Army regulation
says l got to box?

207
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:52,936
Every boxer in this outfit's a non-com.

208
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,150
l guess you've never seen
a bunch of them get together...

209
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,650
...and give a man ''The Treatment.''

210
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:03,275
What do you mean ''chick''? She's 45.

211
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,829
She's still too young for you.

212
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:08,330
l'm a better man than you any day
and don't forget it.

213
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,448
l won't forget it.

214
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,086
What's the deal with him, anyway?

215
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:16,840
With Warden. l don't figure him.

216
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,540
Warden?

217
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:23,094
He ain't like the others.

218
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,390
He'll make it tough on you.

219
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:31,974
But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,
and he won't come over it.

220
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:35,192
You don't see many top kicks
like him no more.

221
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,520
He was with the 15th in Shanghai
when they saw their action.

222
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,987
l heard about it
down in the Philippines, even.

223
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:45,243
All l know is,
he's the best soldier l ever saw.

224
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,853
Count cadence, count!

225
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:15,604
One, two, three, four.

226
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:17,567
Prewitt! Get in step!

227
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:20,028
Hut! Hut!

228
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:23,367
Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic!
Get in step!

229
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:26,120
Hut! Hut! Hut!

230
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,452
Halt!

231
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:39,043
Left face!

232
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:43,044
Prewitt! One step forward. March!

233
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:49,514
You march like a drunken gooney bird.
l got to teach you how to drill. Stay here.

234
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:52,271
Platoon, dismissed!

235
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,515
Detail, right face!

236
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,229
Detail, forward march!

237
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,441
Half left march!

238
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:10,656
Half right march!

239
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:27,509
Assemble your weapons.

240
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:30,098
All right, start.

241
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,638
A rifle's your best friend.

242
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:37,187
ln the case it jams in combat,
could mean life or death.

243
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:42,529
You got to learn to strip them down
and put them back together, blindfolded.

244
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:03,173
Your rear sight's way off!

245
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,005
You'd be 50 feet off-target at 300 yards.

246
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:09,755
That's what happens when a soldier
don't know how to assemble his rifle.

247
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:14,096
Seven laps around the track, double time.
Keep the rifle at high port!

248
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,167
Wide open, huh, Prewitt?

249
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:49,090
Maybe seven more laps
will teach you to watch yourself.

250
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,216
Are you cra<i>z</i>y? l saw what you did.

251
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:15,325
Nothing but trouble.
Better keep your mind off her.

252
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:18,499
What do you wanna do,
wind up in Leavenworth?

253
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:34,181
l won't be back in time to take retreat.
Or reveille, either.

254
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,554
All work and no play, Sergeant.

255
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:42,975
All you do is sit around
sweating over papers.

256
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,474
There are other things in the world
beside work.

257
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,645
You ought to get out
more yourself, Warden.

258
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:49,068
l've been considering it.

259
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:52,821
Well, l'm going.
l'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.

260
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:55,698
lt'll be here when you get back, sir.

261
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:31,947
Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

262
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:38,161
You'd better step inside or you'll get wet.

263
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:40,034
l am wet.

264
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:45,001
lf you're looking for the Captain,
he isn't here.

265
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:47,377
And if l'm not looking for him?

266
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,048
He still isn't here.

267
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:52,921
l'm looking for him.
You know where he is?

268
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:57,265
l haven't the slightest idea.
Perhaps he's in town on business.

269
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,684
That's the way you put it
the other day, isn't it?

270
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:04,139
l got some papers
it's important for him to sign.

271
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:08,560
l'll try phoning him at the club.

272
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:11,060
-Maybe he's there.
-Don't do that.

273
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:15,152
l never like to disturb a man
when he's drinking.

274
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:19,945
l could use a drink myself.

275
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,788
Do you wanna ask me in?

276
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,635
The liquor's there, Sergeant.
ln the cabinet.

277
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:41,764
You're taking an awful chance, you know.

278
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,604
My maid is liable to be home anytime.

279
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:48,315
No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.

280
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:52,568
You think of everything, don't you?

281
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:55,406
l try. ln my position, you have to.

282
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,334
Are these really important?

283
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:10,203
Yes. But not important
they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.

284
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:16,176
l got copies at the office.

285
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:19,049
So it won't be much work to fix them up.

286
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,301
That's what l like about you, Sergeant.
You have confidence.

287
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:24,432
lt's also what l dislike about you.

288
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,228
lt's not confidence, ma'am.

289
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:27,808
lt's honesty.

290
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:30,568
l hate to see a beautiful woman
going to waste.

291
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:32,401
''Waste'' did you say?

292
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,695
There's a subject
l might tell you something about.

293
00:22:37,283 --> 00:22:39,952
l know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.

294
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:43,202
You're probably not even remotely aware
of some of them.

295
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,281
Would you like to hear?

296
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,875
For instance,
what about the house without a child?

297
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:51,037
There's one sort for you.

298
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:54,958
Then there's another<i>....</i>

299
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,672
You're doing fine, Sergeant.

300
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:06,185
My husband's off somewhere,
it's raining and we're both drinking now.

301
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,428
You've probably only got one thing wrong:

302
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:10,349
The lady herself.

303
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,933
The lady's not what she seems.

304
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:17,322
She's a washout,
if you know what l mean...

305
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:20,319
...and l'm sure you know what l mean.

306
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,410
You gonna cry?

307
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:25,203
Not if l can help it.

308
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:35,088
What are you doing?

309
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,048
l'm leaving. lsn't that what you want?

310
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,680
l don't know, Sergeant.

311
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,969
l don't know.

312
00:24:23,556 --> 00:24:25,429
-Speed it up.
-l'm speeding.

313
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:26,891
''Payday''

314
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:32,971
All right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?
Knock it off.

315
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:36,187
Angelo! A dollar he's wrong, coming up.

316
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,652
Sorry, l already won my bankroll
in the latrine.

317
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:44,148
Besides, it's a penny-ante game.

318
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,412
Come on, buddy boy, we're going to town.

319
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:06,261
Look, don't let them get your goat.

320
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:09,598
We dress up in civvies
and we're as good as the rest of the world.

321
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:15,098
Here, wear this.

322
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:17,563
My sister sent it to me.

323
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:19,977
She buys everything too big.

324
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:26,192
Look, first we hit a few bars, see?

325
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:29,452
Then we go to a place where l'm
a member: The New Congress Club.

326
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,324
Girls!

327
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,249
Any prejudices against girls?

328
00:25:37,254 --> 00:25:39,164
That's what l thought.

329
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:44,052
Well, it looks like you're all primed
for a big night.

330
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,299
Hello, Stark.

331
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:48,009
-You want some company?
-No, thanks. All tied up.

332
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,091
Leva says you've been eyeing the Captain's
wife like a hound at hunting.

333
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:54,973
He has, huh?
What else did that character tell you?

334
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:57,556
She took up with a lot of men
back at Fort Bliss.

335
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,223
l wouldn't put stock in stories like that.

336
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,110
This ain't no story.

337
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,860
Because l was one of them myself.

338
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,491
Not for long, though.

339
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,817
Sure is something strange
about that woman.

340
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:10,904
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

341
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:12,617
See you.

342
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,538
Hello.

343
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,084
-l didn't think you were coming.
-Why not? l ain't late.

344
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:30,180
No, l guess you're not.

345
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:33,308
But l got here a little early.
l must have been over-anxious.

346
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:37,261
-You weren't, though, were you?
-l stopped along the way for a few drinks.

347
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:39,396
You chose a lovely spot for our meeting.

348
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:42,188
l've had three chances to be picked up
in five minutes.

349
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:44,235
That's par for the course around here.

350
00:26:44,321 --> 00:26:46,444
Well, l don't care for it.

351
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:48,863
l never went in much for back-alley loving.

352
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:50,445
Take it easy.

353
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,412
You probably think l'm a tramp.

354
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,369
What makes you think
l'd think a thing like that?

355
00:26:58,461 --> 00:26:59,789
Don't try to be gallant.

356
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:03,663
lf you think this is a mistake,
come right out and say so.

357
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:10,424
Well, l guess it's about time for me
to be getting home, isn't it?

358
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,969
lsn't it?

359
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:14,679
What's the matter?
What started all this, anyway?

360
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:17,224
You think l'd be here
if l thought it was a mistake?

361
00:27:17,313 --> 00:27:21,725
Risking 20 years in Leavenworth
for a date with the Commander's wife?

362
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:25,897
And her acting like Lady Astor's horse,
and all because l got here on time!

363
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,244
On the other hand,
l've got a bathing suit under my dress.

364
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,360
Me, too.

365
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:20,035
Why, it's Angelo Maggio.

366
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,118
Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

367
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:33,220
There you are, sweetie-pie.
Dues all paid up.

368
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:36,172
Who you got playing the piano, a hippo?

369
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:38,343
Angelo, l don't think l've met your friend.

370
00:28:38,436 --> 00:28:40,475
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

371
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:43,433
You know how l hate it
when you boys are in this condition.

372
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:44,555
You see that, buddy boy?

373
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,817
A woman sees a soldier and, like that,
she figures he's drunk.

374
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:50,525
-You know why?
-Because he is.

375
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:54,108
Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
with the entertainment business.

376
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:56,360
A respectable place
must consider its future.

377
00:28:56,453 --> 00:29:00,997
Mrs. Kipfer, you have my solemn word
your future will be safe with us.

378
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,450
Angelo is one of my favourites.

379
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:07,880
Annette, dear, take care of this gentleman
for me, will you, please?

380
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,671
That'll be $4, babyface.

381
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:14,171
$2 for initiation fee,
$2 for this month's dues.

382
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:15,342
What do l get for it?

383
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:17,679
Entitlement to all privileges of the club:

384
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:20,216
Dancing, snack bar, soft drink bar.

385
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:22,718
Gentlemanly relaxation
with the opposite gender.

386
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:25,607
So long as they are gentlemen.
No liquor is permitted.

387
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:26,521
Got it?

388
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:28,020
l've got it.

389
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:01,468
Girls, here's some new poison.

390
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,310
This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.

391
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:05,229
-Nice meeting you.
-Hi, there.

392
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:16,240
Don't tell me the princess is your style.

393
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,361
This is Su<i>z</i>anne and Roxanne.

394
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:22,660
Hello, there.

395
00:30:22,748 --> 00:30:25,583
-Would you like to dance, honey?
-Hey!

396
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,373
Much as l adore your company...

397
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:33,963
...l hope l may be allowed
to tear myself away.

398
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:35,759
l just saw a few friends at the door.

399
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:39,677
l can also see that l will be
of no further use to you.

400
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:52,441
Hi. You busy?

401
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:55,822
What's your name?

402
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,111
l'm Lorene.

403
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:00,029
Lorene?

404
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:04,615
l haven't seen you in here before.

405
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:06,707
l haven't been in here before.

406
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:11,827
My friend brought me.
He and l are stationed out at Schofield.

407
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:14,170
l didn't think you were a soldier.

408
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:16,085
What do you mean?

409
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:19,042
-Well, l--
-l'm a 30-year man, in for the whole ride.

410
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:23,473
l suppose it's different
when a fellow makes a career of it.

411
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,971
Nothing wrong with a soldier
that isn't wrong with everyone else.

412
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:30,562
l like you just the same.

413
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:33,314
l liked you the minute
l saw Annette bring you in.

414
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:34,690
You did?

415
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:38,819
lt's funny, l came in and stood there
and saw you sitting over here.

416
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:41,612
Knock it off, buddy.
Put a mute in that thing.

417
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:44,703
l'll play as loud as l want, you little wop!

418
00:31:44,872 --> 00:31:45,903
''Little wop''?

419
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:49,039
Mess with me, fatstuff, l'll bust you up.

420
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,961
You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.

421
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:55,541
-Wait right here for me, will you?
-Yeah, sure.

422
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:57,874
l will not have this.

423
00:31:57,968 --> 00:32:02,013
-Mussolini's telling me how to play.
-Busting my eardrums with his noise!

424
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:03,592
-Let's not be cruel.
-Break it up.

425
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:05,556
You'll have to go if you can't behave.

426
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:08,015
Only my friends call me ''wop''!

427
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:10,770
-You know who that guy is?
-What do l care?

428
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:11,888
Who is he?

429
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:14,652
Fatso Judson.
Sergeant of the Guard at the stockade.

430
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:20,605
Let him alone.

431
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:23,239
l seen him nearly murder a guy once.
He likes it.

432
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:26,328
Okay, bullyboy, now you won the war.
Let's dance, huh?

433
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:27,576
Yeah, we'll dance.

434
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,539
First l got to calm my nerves.

435
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:33,492
Let's go to a phone booth
where l'll unveil a fifth of whisky...

436
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:36,588
...l have hidden here
under my loose-flowing sports shirt.

437
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,501
Don't get hurt, pal.

438
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:51,890
Your balance has got to be letter-perfect.

439
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:54,267
l thought you were gonna wait?

440
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,191
Bill was telling me about surfboarding.

441
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:57,308
Hello, friend.

442
00:32:57,444 --> 00:33:00,149
Just sit down and listen.
He describes it thrillingly.

443
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,066
You know anything about surfboarding?

444
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,281
No, nothing. Not a thing.

445
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,909
You must be stationed inland.
At DeRussey l get lots of chances.

446
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:10,073
Yeah, but we got mountains.

447
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:12,994
-Know anything about mountain climbing?
-A little bit.

448
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:15,250
-You a mountain climber?
-No.

449
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:18,084
-Know about flying a plane?
-l've had a few lessons.

450
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:19,798
l can't fly, either.

451
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:22,754
What do you know about deepsea diving?

452
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:25,885
Bill, shall we move into another room?

453
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,390
Sure. The air in here seems
to have gotten lousy, hasn't it?

454
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:31,386
-l noticed that.
-Listen, fella.

455
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,222
Come on, let's go.

456
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:39,835
How's the deepsea diver?

457
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,880
That was a terrible way you acted.

458
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:43,795
Maybe l was jealous.

459
00:34:47,012 --> 00:34:48,210
You're a funny one.

460
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:51,760
What do you dames want?
To tease a man to death?

461
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:55,683
Mrs. Kipfer pays us to be nice
to all the boys.

462
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:58,725
They're all alike. ls it so important?

463
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:02,648
lt is important.
We may seem all alike, we ain't all alike.

464
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,361
l'm sorry.

465
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:11,035
Look<i>....</i>

466
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:15,287
Let's go sit up in Mrs. Kipfer's parlour.

467
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:18,743
She lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special.

468
00:35:18,836 --> 00:35:20,460
l'll go ask her.

469
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,790
-Then you're not mad?
-No, l'm not mad.

470
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:28,212
Because if you're still mad,
l'd just rather we call the whole thing off.

471
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:31,421
You certainly are a funny one.

472
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:12,969
l never knew it could be like this.

473
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:16,007
Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

474
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:17,765
Nobody?

475
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:19,936
No. Nobody.

476
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:24,313
Not even one? Out of all the men
you've been kissed by?

477
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:27,319
Now, that'd take some figuring.

478
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,482
How many do you think there have been?

479
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:30,604
l wouldn't know.

480
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:34,075
-Can't you give me a rough estimate?
-Not without an adding machine.

481
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:36,035
Do you have
your adding machine with you?

482
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:37,865
l forgot to bring it.

483
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:40,874
Then l guess you won't find out, will you?

484
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:44,502
Maybe l already know.

485
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,503
What's the matter?

486
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:52,919
What are you hinting at?

487
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:55,511
Why? ls there something to hint at?

488
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:59,178
Maybe there's been a long line
of beach parties.

489
00:36:59,395 --> 00:37:00,510
You must be cra<i>z</i>y.

490
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:01,885
Am l?

491
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:04,650
What about when you and Holmes
were back at Fort Bliss?

492
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:07,855
Did you ever hear
of a soldier named Stark?

493
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,522
Maylon Stark?

494
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,738
Why, yes.

495
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:17,324
''Why, yes.''

496
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:19,577
You knew him, too, didn't you?

497
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:21,284
Didn't you?

498
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:24,918
l had to go and forget
you were like all the rest of them.

499
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:26,462
Only it's true, ain't it?

500
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,125
Well, ain't it?

501
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:39,559
Why don't you tell me about it?

502
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:40,806
Tell me the story.

503
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,603
There's always a story.

504
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:46,226
You don't leave a person anything, do you?

505
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:07,081
Come back here, Sergeant.
l'll tell you the story.

506
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,213
You can take it back
to the barracks with you.

507
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:23,309
l'd only been married to Dana two years
when l found out he was cheating.

508
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:25,804
But by that time, l was pregnant.

509
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:28,223
l thought l had something to hope for.

510
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:31,401
l was almost happy
the night the pains began.

511
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:34,900
l remember
Dana was going to an officers' conference.

512
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,571
l told him to get home early,
to bring the doctor.

513
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,946
He might have, if his conference
hadn't been with a hatcheck girl.

514
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:44,625
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

515
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,915
l was lying on the floor.

516
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:51,790
l begged him to go for the doctor,
but he fell on the couch and passed out.

517
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:54,670
The baby was born about an hour later.

518
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:56,718
Of course it was dead.

519
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:58,341
lt was a boy.

520
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,557
But they worked over me at the hospital,
fixed me up fine.

521
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:04,477
They even took my appendix out,
threw that in free.

522
00:39:04,562 --> 00:39:05,641
Karen.

523
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:08,647
And one more thing: No more children.

524
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:14,362
Sure, l went out with men after that.
And if l'd ever found one that--

525
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:16,980
Karen, listen to me, listen.

526
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:21,697
l know.

527
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:26,323
Until l met you,
l didn't think it was possible either.

528
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:43,923
l enlisted too.

529
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:47,102
Came out here on my own
to get away from my hometown in Oregon.

530
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:49,684
How come?

531
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:52,017
l had a boyfriend.

532
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:55,735
l was a waitress, and he was
from the richest family in town.

533
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:58,822
He just married a girl
suitable for his position.

534
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:01,862
After three years of going around with me.

535
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:05,613
A pretty story, isn't it?
Maybe they could write a book about it.

536
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,948
They did. Thousands of them.

537
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,707
So l left and went to Seattle.

538
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:13,120
When l got there
l met a girl back from Hawaii.

539
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:15,290
She said she'd made a lot of money there.

540
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:17,174
So l caught the first boat.

541
00:40:17,468 --> 00:40:19,840
l've been here a year and two months.

542
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:21,720
You don't like it very much, do you?

543
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:23,970
Oh, l don't like it. But l don't mind it.

544
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,139
Anyway, l won't be here forever.

545
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:28,718
No. Sure. l mean, why should you?

546
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:30,480
l got it all figured out.

547
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:34,189
ln another year, l'll be back home,
with a stocking full of money.

548
00:40:34,276 --> 00:40:36,814
And l'll be all set for life.

549
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:38,394
Who is it?

550
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,448
l didn't hear no sounds of combat,
so l thought you might want a drink.

551
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,499
You've been hogging the whisky, Angelo.

552
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:55,666
Not me, buddy. lt's that Sandra.
She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.

553
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:00,374
l hope there's a cop under that.

554
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:05,181
Keep pouring.

555
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:10,308
No, thanks. l don't drink.

556
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:12,685
l think it's a weakness.

557
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,066
l grant you that.

558
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:21,026
l don't like weakness. Do you?

559
00:41:21,198 --> 00:41:23,487
No, l don't like weakness.
But l like to drink.

560
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:32,241
What are you going to do, marry this guy?

561
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:34,660
You're grinning at him like you're his wife.

562
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,539
Get out of here!

563
00:41:37,214 --> 00:41:39,254
Okay. l'm going.

564
00:41:39,508 --> 00:41:41,834
Back to old long-legged Sandra.

565
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:44,501
l love them tall. Acres and acres.

566
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:52,845
Enjoy yourself, paisan.

567
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:54,475
You need this more than l do.

568
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:56,932
Tomorrow you'll be back
with ''The Treatment.''

569
00:41:59,528 --> 00:42:01,272
What does he mean?

570
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:05,068
That was nice before.

571
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,151
The way you snuggled up in front of him.

572
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:09,071
What's ''The Treatment''?

573
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:14,831
Some of the guys putting me
over the jumps 'cause l don't want to fight.

574
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:15,784
Fight?

575
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:17,878
Yeah. On the boxing team.

576
00:42:17,963 --> 00:42:20,715
l don't want to box.
l don't even want to think about it.

577
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,507
Why should you have to box?

578
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:27,128
Well, see, l used to fight, middleweight.

579
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:30,589
l was pretty good, and they know it.

580
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,103
Well, anyway<i>....</i>

581
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:36,980
Well, come on. Tell me. l want to hear.

582
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:40,100
Well, the thing is, see<i>....</i>

583
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:43,566
l used to work out with this guy,
Dixie Wells.

584
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,821
He's a real good friend of mine.

585
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:49,158
He loved to box.
People on the outside had their eye on him.

586
00:42:49,245 --> 00:42:52,578
He was gonna come out of the Army
and go right up to the top.

587
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,576
Well, one afternoon...

588
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:57,874
...he and l were sparring in the gym.

589
00:42:57,962 --> 00:43:00,500
You know, kind of friendly-like.

590
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:04,249
He must have been set pretty flat
on his feet...

591
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:07,463
...'cause l caught him...

592
00:43:07,555 --> 00:43:12,382
...with a no-more-than-ordinary right cross.

593
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:18,647
He didn't get up. He didn't move.

594
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:21,392
He was in a coma for a week.

595
00:43:21,652 --> 00:43:23,728
Finally, he did pull out of it.

596
00:43:24,697 --> 00:43:26,903
Only, the thing was, he was blind.

597
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:36,322
l went to see him at the hospital
a couple of times.

598
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:39,826
Finally, l just couldn't go back.

599
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,704
The last time he and l started talking
about fighting and<i>....</i>

600
00:43:46,385 --> 00:43:48,128
He started to cry.

601
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:53,884
Seeing tears coming out of those eyes
that couldn't see anything<i>....</i>

602
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:21,919
l thought l ought to tell you.

603
00:44:22,004 --> 00:44:23,961
Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.

604
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:26,207
From now on, it's no holds barred.

605
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:29,218
They aim to run you
right into the stockade if they got to.

606
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:30,583
Let them.

607
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,090
l'll help you as much as l can.

608
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,675
But l can't go too far out on a limb.

609
00:44:35,768 --> 00:44:37,559
l ain't risking losing my stripes.

610
00:44:37,645 --> 00:44:39,020
l like this outfit.

611
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:42,474
So do l. That's funny, ain't it?

612
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:44,393
Yeah, that is funny.

613
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:53,151
Keep going in a straight line, Prewitt.

614
00:44:55,788 --> 00:44:57,198
Keep going!

615
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:06,164
All right, that's enough.

616
00:45:18,686 --> 00:45:22,185
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

617
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:21,619
Time!

618
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,758
Clean up the mess, Prewitt.

619
00:46:42,228 --> 00:46:45,644
Hurry it up.
You're on fatigue detail, not vacation.

620
00:46:56,575 --> 00:46:58,153
Come on, clean it up!

621
00:46:58,786 --> 00:47:00,660
Clean it up yourself!

622
00:47:01,414 --> 00:47:02,528
What?

623
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:04,912
You heard me.
Rub your own nose in it a while.

624
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,535
Prewitt, you know better than talk back
to a non-commissioned officer.

625
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:13,048
Yes, sir, but l've never liked being spit on,
not even by a non-commissioned officer.

626
00:47:13,342 --> 00:47:15,216
You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.

627
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:18,173
l don't think so.
Sergeant Galovitch owes me an apology.

628
00:47:18,264 --> 00:47:19,806
Corporal Peluso?

629
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,975
Have this man roll a full field pack,
extra shoes and helmet.

630
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,895
Take a bicycle and hike him up
to Kole Kole Pass and back.

631
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,186
-Then bring him to me.
-Yes, sir.

632
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:29,982
All right, Prewitt, let's go.

633
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:31,230
Time!

634
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,322
Hold it a minute.

635
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:48,875
Go ahead and have a cigarette.

636
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:51,000
l don't like this any more than you do.

637
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:52,333
Thanks.

638
00:47:55,593 --> 00:47:59,460
l take it you're ready to apologise
to Sergeant Galovitch now?

639
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:01,346
No, sir, l'm not.

640
00:48:02,683 --> 00:48:05,470
Peluso, take him up there again.

641
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,141
Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, let's go.

642
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:29,660
You can't be decent to a man like that.
You have to treat him like an animal.

643
00:48:32,755 --> 00:48:34,664
Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.

644
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,296
lnsubordination
to a non-commissioned officer.

645
00:48:37,426 --> 00:48:39,419
Yes, sir.

646
00:48:50,272 --> 00:48:51,648
Only, it's a shame.

647
00:48:51,732 --> 00:48:52,763
What is?

648
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:55,645
l was thinking,
too bad you'll lose a good middleweight.

649
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:58,061
l don't care.
l don't have to tolerate such insolence.

650
00:48:58,155 --> 00:49:00,195
No, sir, you sure don't.

651
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,948
l'll prepare the papers then.

652
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:08,581
Trouble is,
even if he gets just three months...

653
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:11,951
...he'll still be in the stockade
for the boxing finals.

654
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:14,915
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

655
00:49:16,882 --> 00:49:19,171
You could double up
on company punishment, sir.

656
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,833
All right. l'll throw the book at him.

657
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:24,842
lf you think that's the way to do it.

658
00:49:33,232 --> 00:49:34,976
Nice going, Sarge.

659
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:40,939
Keep looking, you'll find yourself
scrubbing this orderly room floor!

660
00:49:57,882 --> 00:49:59,292
Coming through! Watch it.

661
00:49:59,383 --> 00:50:01,506
Me and my waiters
are working our tails off.

662
00:50:01,593 --> 00:50:03,302
Hot! Hot! H-O-T!

663
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:08,386
How you doing, buddy boy?

664
00:50:08,476 --> 00:50:11,891
Better than being thrown in the stockade,
ain't it?

665
00:50:13,439 --> 00:50:16,012
How am l doing, Sarge? l'm a rough man.

666
00:50:16,108 --> 00:50:18,397
Slow up a little, stop sweating in the food.

667
00:50:18,486 --> 00:50:21,652
Don't hold me back, Sarge.
l'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.

668
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:22,818
You'll never make it.

669
00:50:22,907 --> 00:50:24,816
-Hi, Sarge.
-Hi, Top.

670
00:50:37,213 --> 00:50:39,252
Life in a rifle company.

671
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:44,049
You look awful tired, kid.

672
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:47,885
How do you like straight duty?

673
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:49,474
What makes you think l mind it?

674
00:50:49,558 --> 00:50:51,266
l didn't say you minded it.

675
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:55,052
l just said you looked tired.
You know, drawn to a fine edge.

676
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:57,561
l like this life. lt's a great life.

677
00:50:57,817 --> 00:50:59,856
lf l find a pearl, l'll cut you in.

678
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:01,735
Fifty-fifty. You know what l mean?

679
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:05,237
lf you didn't put me here,
l'd have no chance to find it, right?

680
00:51:05,324 --> 00:51:07,815
Now, there's a man for you.
What do you know?

681
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,113
Since you like it so much,
l'll see if l can find more for you.

682
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:13,281
How about garbage detail?

683
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,034
Thanks. l had that on Wednesday.

684
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:18,043
So, you did. What about street cleaning?

685
00:51:18,963 --> 00:51:20,125
Yesterday.

686
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:22,337
You got a better memory than me.

687
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:24,251
Of course, if you were smart<i>....</i>

688
00:51:25,135 --> 00:51:26,416
Yeah, but l ain't smart.

689
00:51:26,512 --> 00:51:29,762
l know. But if you were,
you wouldn't have to pull KP.

690
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:31,806
Or any other fatigue duty for that matter.

691
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:37,893
lf you think you can bribe me into boxing,
Warden, you're wrong.

692
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:41,310
Not you and Dynamite Holmes
and ''The Treatment.''

693
00:51:48,325 --> 00:51:51,825
How long are you guys gonna keep
breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?

694
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:55,075
You've had him on that extra duty roster
a month already.

695
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:57,040
-l can't see why you--
-Can't you, Pete?

696
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:00,663
Getting soft in your old age?
Maybe l want to teach him a lesson.

697
00:52:00,754 --> 00:52:02,877
-Maybe you like it.
-Maybe l do.

698
00:52:03,174 --> 00:52:06,459
l'm getting sick and tired
watching you being a stooge for Holmes.

699
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:11,135
You won't see it much longer.
l'm getting sick and tired of it myself.

700
00:52:11,223 --> 00:52:14,141
l'm through, Pete.
Any day now. And l mean it.

701
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:17,519
Listen, if Holmes'd let me,
l'd transfer out of here tomorrow.

702
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:21,062
Half a do<i>z</i>en companies in this regiment
would grab me, in grade, too.

703
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,688
Oh, sure. l could be Chief of Staff, too.

704
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:26,351
Only l just can't think of leaving
my old buddies.

705
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:28,148
Where're you going, Little Sir Echo?

706
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,656
To take my shower, if the stinking
First Sergeant has no objections.

707
00:52:31,744 --> 00:52:33,902
Where'd you think?
To the movies in this towel?

708
00:52:33,996 --> 00:52:35,371
Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

709
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:38,374
l wouldn't drink with you
if it was the last beer on Earth.

710
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:39,870
l'm buying.

711
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:42,371
That's different.

712
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:09,860
Do you know why l like
to have you serve me beer?

713
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:12,819
So as l can watch you
when you walk away.

714
00:53:15,955 --> 00:53:18,576
lt's in regulations.
You got a right to complain.

715
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,536
You've a right to take your case
to the lnspector General.

716
00:53:21,627 --> 00:53:24,498
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

717
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:27,625
Nope. l ain't gonna complain.

718
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,051
They ain't going to get that satisfaction.

719
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:37,432
This soldier's got a real big family.
Fifteen of them.

720
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,392
'Course this is only half of them.

721
00:53:39,478 --> 00:53:41,387
You see the gentleman
with the handlebars?

722
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,434
That's Mr. Maggio.
Mr. Maggio is my father.

723
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:49,946
l never saw anyone so stubborn.

724
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:53,447
-How long since they let you go into town?
-Six weeks.

725
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:54,697
Liable to be six years.

726
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:57,193
How'd you like it?
Six years before you see a dame?

727
00:53:57,288 --> 00:54:00,242
Look, why don't you just
mind your own business?

728
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,286
And why don't you learn to play the bugle?

729
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:40,158
That's my buddy boy!

730
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:56,839
Who's the broad?

731
00:54:57,139 --> 00:54:58,717
lt's my sister.

732
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,062
You hit me!

733
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:17,027
Yeah, and l'm about to do it again, too.

734
00:55:19,078 --> 00:55:20,702
Why, you dirty wop!

735
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,703
lf you want to fight, take it outside!

736
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,332
l'll cut this wop's heart out.

737
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:27,536
Anybody steps in here,
l give it to him first.

738
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:32,375
One step further, Fatso,
and l'm going to de-brain you.

739
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:35,586
Nobody's doing nothing.
Anybody does any killing, l'll do it!

740
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:37,178
lt's a private affair, Warden.

741
00:55:37,263 --> 00:55:39,932
No, it isn't! This man's in my company!

742
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:44,434
And you ain't making two
extra weeks' paperwork for me for nothing.
