1
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,455
Out for blood, huh?

2
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:15,502
You'd puke at the sight of a dead man.

3
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:18,126
Put down that stool. Put it down!

4
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:25,923
Drop that knife.

5
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:34,094
Okay, Fatso,
if it's killing you want, come on.

6
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,858
Well, come on!

7
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:45,065
On the floor!

8
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:58,201
Killers, huh?

9
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:01,880
l'd trade the pair of you
for a good Camp Fire Girl!

10
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,725
Tough monkey.

11
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:15,812
Guys like you end up in the stockade
sooner or later.

12
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:19,019
Some day you'll walk in, l'll be waiting.

13
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:21,150
l'll show you a couple of things.

14
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:43,289
l'm going to get a breath of air.

15
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,302
l'm glad he stopped it.

16
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,014
He's a good man.

17
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:19,497
You keep it. Keep it for a souvenir.

18
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,002
Okay, l'll keep it.

19
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:26,167
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?

20
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,933
Could you stand a weekend pass?

21
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,064
Could l<i>....</i>

22
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:43,356
What about Holmes?

23
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:45,028
Don't worry about Holmes.

24
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:47,438
He signs anything without reading it.

25
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,567
l sure could use it.

26
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,163
l hear you've gone dippy over some dame
down at the New Congress Club.

27
00:02:58,668 --> 00:02:59,996
What'd you say her name was?

28
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:01,331
Lorene.

29
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,580
lt's a beautiful name.

30
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,313
Hey, paisan!

31
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,725
What's holding you up? Let's get going.

32
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:27,317
What's wrong? Don't you like it here?
Something better to do in town?

33
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,110
The bus is leaving right away.
l'm taking the bus.

34
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,236
Take off. You're talking to a rich man.
l'll hop a taxi.

35
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,403
l'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.

36
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:47,749
Maggio. Get ready for guard.

37
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:51,757
Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.
Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.

38
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,554
What? l got a pass!

39
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:56,428
Not anymore.
Anderson's sick. You're on guard.

40
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,593
l just had guard yesterday. Why me?

41
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:02,262
l'll tell you why, you.
You should have gotten dressed faster.

42
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,948
l sure never figured
on your giving me the runaround.

43
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,825
They didn't even want to let me in.

44
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,025
We're mobbed, that's why.

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,611
A big crowd from Hickam Field
got in here first.

46
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:21,114
-Did you expect a brass band to meet you?
-No.

47
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,537
Thought you'd want to see me.

48
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,037
l'm busy, can't you see? Look.

49
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:25,373
Yes, l see it's crowded.

50
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:26,542
Well, l am.

51
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:31,753
Maggio's going to be
at the Kalakaua lnn later.

52
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,885
ls there no way you can get out of here?

53
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,389
What's the matter with you?

54
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,134
l work here, you know, after all.

55
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:39,506
Can't you understand?

56
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:45,555
Yes, l do. l understand.
l understand very well.

57
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:50,647
You haven't been here in weeks.
Now you turn up all of a sudden--

58
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:53,063
Watch it, Mack!
Watch where you're going!

59
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:54,984
Come on out of here.

60
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:07,373
Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?
l can't just walk out.

61
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:10,417
-Even if l could, she doesn't like us--
-All right, look.

62
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:13,213
lf you feel that way,
just forget about it, okay?

63
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:15,211
You haven't any claims on me, mister.

64
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,929
You're not my husband, you know.

65
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:18,129
There you are.

66
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:21,260
l vastly admire your taste,
but we really need Lorene now.

67
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:23,179
So many gentlemen are unattended.

68
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,895
-lt is such a rush, isn't it?
-Yeah.

69
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:28,599
Almost like one of those big
political conventions in Philadelphia.

70
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,068
You are coming, Lorene?

71
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,647
ln a minute.

72
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,521
l'm sorry.

73
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:40,364
How do you think l feel?
l may not get another pass for months.

74
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,448
l've been counting on this
like a kid counts on Christmas.

75
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:47,372
But forget it.

76
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:49,917
Lorene's busy, she's got work to do.
Lorene's sorry.

77
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,998
Stop calling me Lorene! My name's Alma!

78
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,918
-Alma?
-Yes, Alma Burke!

79
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:55,297
Alma?

80
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,013
Mrs. Kipfer picked Lorene
out of a perfume ad.

81
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:05,511
She thought it sounded French.

82
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:26,416
Hey, how did you get away?

83
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:28,666
l told Mrs. Kipfer l was sick.

84
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:31,630
-But l bet she doesn't believe it.
-l bet she doesn't.

85
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,419
-What'll you have?
-A Coke, please.

86
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,715
Give her a big Coke.

87
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:38,677
lt's great you meeting me here.

88
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:41,929
You know, l'm just lucky getting in town.

89
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:43,296
Top Kick gave me a break.

90
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,095
They still pouring it on?

91
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:48,104
Holmes and those others,
they really got me on the edge.

92
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,605
-You must hate the Army.
-No, l don't hate the Army.

93
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,692
But look what it's doing to you.

94
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:55,774
l love the Army.

95
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:59,653
But it sure doesn't love you.

96
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:04,698
A man loves a thing,
that don't mean it's got to love him back.

97
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,364
Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.

98
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:12,336
You love a thing, you've got to be grateful.

99
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,380
l left home when l was 17.

100
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:16,131
Both my folks is dead.

101
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:19,800
l didn't belong no place
till l entered the Army.

102
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:22,088
That's where l learned to bugle.

103
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:23,880
To bugle?

104
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,601
That's the mouthpiece l used
when l played a taps at Arlington.

105
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:34,516
They picked me to play a taps
at Arlington Cemetery on Armistice Day.

106
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:36,775
The President was there.

107
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,733
l play the bugle well.

108
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:43,694
Hello, citi<i>z</i>ens!

109
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:46,949
Hey, where you been?

110
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:50,913
Hi, pals. l've been in three bars
and l put a dent in all three of them.

111
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:52,419
Yeah, you look it.

112
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:54,454
Give me a nail. l'm hungry for a nail.

113
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,255
What you doing in uniform?

114
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,832
l'm thinking of joining the Army.

115
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,511
Or maybe l'll go to Mexico
and become a cowboy.

116
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:03,842
You want to go with me?

117
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:08,101
You keep on drinking,
you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

118
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:12,975
You're absolutely right.
Bartender! Large whisky.

119
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,393
Excuse me. Hey, buddy.

120
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:19,269
Sam!

121
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:24,529
Hey, coming out, fellas,
the terror of Gimbels' basement.

122
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,149
Stand back. Here we go.

123
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,953
A seven for Daddy, five deuce.

124
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:30,493
Seven.

125
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,994
Snake eyes.

126
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:34,836
The story of my life.

127
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:42,586
Prew, that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
around the corner...

128
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:44,837
...where all those movie stars stay.

129
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:46,841
Paisan, you'd better simmer down.

130
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,175
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

131
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:51,095
That's what you say, buddy.

132
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:53,808
What do you mean?
They only gave you an overnight pass?

133
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:54,929
No pass.

134
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:57,065
No pass. They put me on guard duty.

135
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,274
But old Angelo, he foxed them.

136
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:01,481
You walked off guard?

137
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:04,152
l checked in and l checked right out again.

138
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:08,370
Get your tail right back to the post.
You're in trouble, you know that.

139
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:10,869
l got a good idea. Let's go swimming!

140
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:14,242
We'll go swimming with a movie star.
That's what l'm gonna do.

141
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,575
Listen, Angelo.

142
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:19,495
Twenty feet tall,
l'm going swimming with a movie star.

143
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:22,877
You'd better go.

144
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:34,271
Hey, Angelo.

145
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,391
You jerk, get up. Wake up.

146
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,812
l'm awake. What are you hollering about?

147
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,981
Yeah, you're awake. Put your clothes on.

148
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:48,360
Give them back to the lndians.
They need the clothes.

149
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:50,570
All they wear is G-strings.

150
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,619
You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.

151
00:09:55,627 --> 00:10:00,703
l am waiting here for a movie star
to come out of the hotel.

152
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,503
l'm not going until she shows up.

153
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,878
Put your clothes on.

154
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:09,972
Let's get out of here
before we get in trouble. Okay?

155
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:11,641
What's the matter with you?

156
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,641
Can't a man get drunk?

157
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,971
Can't a man do nothing?

158
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:21,144
Can't he put his lousy hands
in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

159
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,899
A man gotta be hounded all his life?

160
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:27,571
l'm tired. l ain't no criminal.

161
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,404
l ain't no coward!

162
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:31,201
Buddy boy, look<i>....</i>

163
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,785
Get dressed, put your clothes on.

164
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,210
-Wait for me? l'll get a cab.
-Yeah, sure.

165
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:41,667
-Will you wait?
-You get a cab.

166
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:00,438
Hey, MPs! Come and get me, you guys!

167
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,102
Here l am!

168
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,989
ls that the best you can do?

169
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,316
l bet you guys eat Wheaties!

170
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,668
Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?

171
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,458
lt's on right now.

172
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,174
He'll get the stockade sure.

173
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,796
Maybe he won't get it.

174
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,925
All he did was to get drunk.

175
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:37,092
lt's a soldier's nature.
lt's almost a sacred duty once in a while.

176
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,061
But he walked off guard. He went AWOL.

177
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,855
What are you hanging around here for?

178
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,138
Can't a man rest a minute?

179
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:45,269
What man? You got no work?
Maybe l can scare you up some.

180
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:56,037
Go shoot some pool.
Any word comes, l'll let you know.

181
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:03,579
Company G,
First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.

182
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,045
Yes, sir, l'll have his things in order.

183
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:16,716
He got it. Six months.

184
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:30,524
l'm gonna escape from this dump.

185
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,366
Gimbels' basement couldn't hold me,
neither can this.

186
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,776
-Shut up!
-Whatever you say, Brownie.

187
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,781
Prisoner! Halt!

188
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,384
Hello, tough monkey.

189
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:18,491
This other girl and l were lucky to rent it.
This is a very fashionable district.

190
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,573
l have another key made for you.

191
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,622
You can use it any time you want to,
even when l'm not here.

192
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,881
-Hi.
-Hi.

193
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,797
This is Prew, the soldier l told you about.

194
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:41,929
-This is Georgette, my roommate.
-Well, welcome, friend.

195
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,724
Hasn't been a man around the house
since the cat died.

196
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:48,685
l belong to the Book Guild Club.
l always take every book.

197
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:50,603
That's the way l get all the dividends.

198
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:56,024
She'll be great for your friend
when he gets out of the stockade.

199
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:58,442
Yes, he'll be cra<i>z</i>y about her.

200
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,993
Just sit down and get comfortable.

201
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,867
l'll make you a martini
and see what's to cook for dinner.

202
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:11,043
This is like being married, ain't it?

203
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:12,591
lt's better.

204
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,446
You okay?

205
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,010
Glad you came?

206
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,663
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

207
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:08,577
lt can't go on like this much longer.

208
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:12,750
Even though we sneaked across
the island...

209
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:16,585
...we had to run out like jailbirds.

210
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:24,218
lf there was only some way we<i>....</i>

211
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:30,558
Holmes'd probably give you a divorce,
but never let me transfer out of his outfit.

212
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,350
There is a way.

213
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,899
l've been thinking about it.

214
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:38,689
You've got to become an officer.

215
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,981
You can take the new extension course,
the one they passed last May.

216
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:46,491
-Once commissioned you go to the States.
-An officer?

217
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,656
Yes. Then l could divorce Dana
and marry you.

218
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,877
l hate officers. l've always hated officers!

219
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:57,254
Well, that's a fine, intelligent point of view.

220
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:01,420
Suppose l said l always hated sergeants.
That'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

221
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:05,179
You sure made a complete study of it.

222
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:10,348
Okay, suppose l did it.
And don't think it's a cinch.

223
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:13,930
You'd be here, l'd be in the States,
we'd be apart six months!

224
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,811
-We're sure to be into a war--
-Tell the truth.

225
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:20,945
You don't want the responsibility.
You're probably not even in love with me.

226
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,438
You're cra<i>z</i>y! l wish l didn't love you.

227
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,110
Maybe l could enjoy life again.

228
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,250
So they were married
and lived unhappily ever after.

229
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:42,133
l've never been so miserable in my life
as l have since l met you.

230
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:44,045
Neither have l.

231
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:47,679
-l wouldn't trade a minute of it.
-Neither would l.

232
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:54,846
l'll probably make the lousiest officer
in this man's Army you ever saw.

233
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:57,514
You'll make a fine officer.

234
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,268
A remarkable officer.

235
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,444
Thank you.

236
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,453
Come here.

237
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,747
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

238
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:21,668
Honey...

239
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:24,718
...l want to marry you.

240
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,507
You're a funny one.

241
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,593
Why's it funny if a guy
wants to marry you?

242
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:36,056
Because l'm a girl you met
at the New Congress Club.

243
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:38,519
That's about two steps
up from the pavement.

244
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:42,309
Well, what am l?
l'm a private, no-class dogface.

245
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:46,865
The way most civilians look at that,
that's two steps up from nothing.

246
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,692
Prew, l thought we were happy.

247
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:52,739
Why do you want to spoil things?

248
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,081
Look, l've got a year to go
before l re-enlist.

249
00:18:56,793 --> 00:19:00,920
lf l can swing sergeant's stripes by then,
they'll let me go back to the States.

250
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,251
We can go back together...

251
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,001
...if you'll wait.

252
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:07,211
How do you expect to become a sergeant
under Captain Holmes?

253
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,675
lt's all you can do
to keep out of the stockade.

254
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,595
l'll fight.

255
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,050
You're not gonna fight.

256
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:17,474
lt'd be worth it.

257
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:25,569
Prew, it's true we love each other now.

258
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,566
We need each other.

259
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,612
But back in the States
it might be different.

260
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,661
That ain't the real reason.

261
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:41,830
-All right, it's not.
-What is the real reason?

262
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:48,509
l won't marry you because
l don't want to be the wife of a soldier.

263
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:57,135
Well, that would be about the best
l could ever do for you.

264
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:04,521
Because nobody's going to stop me
from my plan. Nobody, nothing.

265
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,562
Because l want to be proper.

266
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:07,936
''Proper''?

267
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,656
Yes, proper.

268
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:13,702
ln another year,
l'll have enough money saved.

269
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,737
l'll go back to my hometown in Oregon.

270
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,451
l'll build a house for my mother and myself.

271
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,210
Join the country club and take up golf.

272
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:26,002
l'll meet the proper man
with the proper position.

273
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:28,833
l'll make a proper wife
who can run a proper home.

274
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,884
Raise proper children.

275
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:35,679
l'll be happy because when you're proper,
you're safe.

276
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,762
You got guts, honey.

277
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,097
l hope you can pull it off.

278
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:55,243
l do mean it when l say l need you,
'cause l'm lonely.

279
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,413
You think l'm lying, don't you?

280
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,371
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

281
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,671
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

282
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:19,093
Why? Because the scandal
would spoil your chances for a promotion?

283
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:22,642
l ask you once more: l want to know
who he is and where you met him.

284
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,438
l'm not going to tell you.

285
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,401
One thing l know: l know he's a civilian.

286
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,858
You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.

287
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,114
l wonder which is hurt more,
your pride or your curiosity?

288
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,276
You can't know how l feel about this.

289
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:39,620
l wonder why men feel so differently
about it than women?

290
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:42,199
lt's just not the same.

291
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:50,124
lt's a lovely day. l think l'll go for a walk.

292
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,843
l hear you just got out of the stockade.

293
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:03,602
lt was rugged.
Kept my mouth shut, didn't get in trouble.

294
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:05,563
Did you see Maggio?

295
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:09,598
Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.
He's using a billy, too.

296
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:13,859
ln places where it won't show.
On the back, on the chest.

297
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:15,906
He's got it down to a system.

298
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:18,031
He kicks him a lot, too.

299
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:20,904
You know how Maggio's taking it?

300
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:24,165
He just keeps spitting in Fatso's eye.

301
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,709
Ain't he a hot one?

302
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,080
Well, he's a good man.

303
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,921
Fatso can't make a dent in him.

304
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:38,632
But, that Fatso, he's smart. He makes sure
the O.D. never sees nothing.

305
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:40,638
Why don't Maggio go to the O.D. himself?

306
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:42,967
We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.

307
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,183
That boy's the toughest nut in the woods.

308
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:48,398
You think he's going to be all right?

309
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:50,061
Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.

310
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:51,182
What do you mean?

311
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,938
After Fatso threw him in the Hole--
That's solitary...

312
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:58,691
...he started talking a couple of times
about how he's gonna escape.

313
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:01,406
He said to tell you
he'll look you up one night.

314
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:05,949
Still on your knees, Prewitt?

315
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,828
Boxing finals next month: December 15.

316
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,503
You've still got time to help us
win the championship.

317
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:17,340
Are you proud to be in this company
or not?

318
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:28,102
l ain't gonna move around you again.

319
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:31,025
Something tells me you need a lesson.

320
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,060
Maybe l'll give it to you myself.

321
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,691
Leave him alone. He's in my detail.

322
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:42,785
You'll get in trouble if you fight here.
Get back to work.

323
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:44,662
Get out of my way!

324
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,895
l'll be glad to recommend you.

325
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,278
You've got service, experience, grade.

326
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:21,986
-You'll make an excellent officer.
-Thank you, sir.

327
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:25,741
lt'd be a feather in my cap, too.
A man from my company.

328
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:29,455
At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?

329
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:32,662
They're fighting outside, sir.
Galovitch and Prewitt.

330
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:33,750
Prewitt?

331
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,459
Galovitch looks like
he's going to murder him.

332
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:38,423
l'll take care of it.

333
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:44,049
Don't you want to see?

334
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,892
No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!

335
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,437
Why don't Prew go for his head?

336
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,065
Blinded a guy once.
Must be scared of the same thing.

337
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,330
The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!

338
00:25:29,018 --> 00:25:30,429
Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!

339
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:31,972
l'll fight any way l want.

340
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,682
Come on, Prew, get up!

341
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:10,715
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

342
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:13,550
-What's his name, Major?
-Captain Holmes, sir.

343
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:44,673
At ease. What started this?

344
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:48,972
Prewitt refused an order l gave him.
Talked back and started a fight.

345
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:50,261
l taught him a lesson.

346
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,391
You won't disobey orders in my company.

347
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,182
Sir, l'm sorry,
but Private Prewitt's not to blame.

348
00:26:56,272 --> 00:26:58,348
Sergeant Galovitch started it.

349
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,852
-Thornhill?
-Yes, sir.

350
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:02,314
You're in charge of this detail.
What about it?

351
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,987
He's right, Prewitt did nothing.

352
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,479
Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.

353
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:09,239
That's all. Let's forget it.

354
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,527
Let's get back to our jobs.

355
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:21,544
lf you guys think this means
l'll step into a ring, you're wrong.

356
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:24,377
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

357
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,261
Hey, Friday.

358
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,346
Why are you called ''Friday''?

359
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,348
l don't know. l was born on a Wednesday.

360
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:26,121
Hey, Prewitt, where you going?

361
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:27,453
Where am l going?

362
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:31,048
l'm going to Choy's.
l'm gonna get me another beer.

363
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:46,264
Halt!

364
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:50,068
Who goes there?

365
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:51,769
A friend.

366
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,315
Advance, friend, and be recognised!

367
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:05,746
Ten-hut!

368
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,879
About face!

369
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:09,292
Rear face!

370
00:30:09,382 --> 00:30:10,544
On your knees!

371
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:12,424
Scrub the floor!

372
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,386
At ease.

373
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,171
Hello, kid.

374
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:21,136
What you doing out here all by yourself?

375
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:25,020
l'm gonna get a little drink.

376
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,182
Sit down. l got a bottle.

377
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,991
Thanks, Top.

378
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,618
l got to hand it to you, kid...

379
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,953
...the way you beat up
old Galovitch this afternoon.

380
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:45,035
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

381
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,588
Life's crummy, you know it?

382
00:30:56,012 --> 00:30:59,096
Yes, sir, it's perfectly miserable.

383
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:05,602
What do you suppose would happen
if a truck came along and ran us over?

384
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:08,147
We'd be dead.

385
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:10,020
Better not sit here anymore.

386
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:13,395
You'd better get up
and sit over on the side of the road.

387
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:15,361
What do you mean, l better?

388
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:17,690
You've got more to live for than l do.

389
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,942
You got your whole company
to take care of.

390
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:22,574
You move over
to the other side of the road.

391
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:25,071
l'm old and it don't matter if l die.

392
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,037
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Don't argue. Get up.

393
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:29,456
No, sir, not Prewitt.

394
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:32,546
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

395
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:38,006
Okay, we'll stay together.

396
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:44,974
l couldn't have got up anyway.

397
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:52,273
l got the biggest troubles
in the whole world.

398
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:55,608
ln the whole world, huh?

399
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,232
Take love.

400
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,115
Did you personally ever see
any of this love?

401
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,028
You'll understand what l mean.

402
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,948
This girl...

403
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,033
...she wants me to become<i>....</i>

404
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:11,709
-Become what?
-An officer.

405
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,460
Can you see me as an officer?

406
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,254
Yeah, l can see you as an officer.

407
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:19,631
You'd be a good officer.

408
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,638
Well, you both can see
more than l can see.

409
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:26,134
l don't wanna be an officer.
l'm happy where l am.

410
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,886
l might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

411
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,521
You wouldn't want me
to be a guy like Holmes, would you?

412
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:38,106
Well, would you?

413
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:41,857
A man should be what he can do.

414
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,170
How's your girl?

415
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,047
What's her name again?

416
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:01,210
Lorene.

417
00:33:01,303 --> 00:33:02,549
Oh, yeah.

418
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:05,264
l remember now.

419
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:07,802
A beautiful name.

420
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:10,056
Beautiful.

421
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,191
You two dumb, cra<i>z</i>y screwballs.

422
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:20,651
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

423
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,483
Why are you in the middle of the road?

424
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:25,825
My friend Prew and l,
we're sitting here discussing the weather.

425
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:28,118
-Your friend, huh?
-You heard me.

426
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,661
Don't you know
you gotta take care of this man?

427
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:33,871
Holmes is bound to get him
sooner or later.

428
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:36,922
And he's the best stinking soldier
in the whole Army.

429
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:39,497
You both got rocks in your head.

430
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:45,423
Angelo.

431
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,848
l figured you'd be here at Choy's.

432
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:55,262
l done it, Prew.

433
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:57,689
l escaped just like l said.

434
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,853
Just like l figured...

435
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:02,567
...in a back of a truck, under a tarp.

436
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,698
They rode me right out.

437
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:06,575
Just like l figured.

438
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:10,703
Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,
about a mile back...

439
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,031
...and l fell out in the road.

440
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:16,083
You should've seen me bounce.

441
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,293
l must've broke something.

442
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:25,887
Prew, listen.

443
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,803
Fatso done it, Prew.

444
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:31,014
He likes to whack me in the gut.

445
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,392
He asks me if it hurts...

446
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,805
...and l spit at him like always.

447
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:39,441
Only yesterday, it was bad.

448
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,319
He hit me...

449
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,029
...he hit me...

450
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,524
...he hit me.

451
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:48,903
l had to get out, Prew.

452
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:54,449
-They gonna send you to the stockade?
-No, they ain't.

453
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,001
Watch out for Fatso.

454
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,623
He'll try to crack you.

455
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:02,957
lf they put you in the Hole...

456
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:04,669
...don't yell.

457
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,759
Don't make a sound.

458
00:35:07,347 --> 00:35:11,047
You'll still be yelling
when they come to take you out.

459
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,094
Just lay there.

460
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,891
Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.

461
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,538
He's dead.

462
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:06,443
l'll bet you that's Prew.

463
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,583
Sergeant Judson?

464
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,967
You want me?

465
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,136
Yeah, Fatso.

466
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:40,058
l don't like that nickname.
You want to see me about something?

467
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:44,102
Let's step around the corner
where we can talk.

468
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:45,929
Okay.

469
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,861
Are you sore about something?

470
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:02,366
l don't like the way you play the piano.

471
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,626
Remember Maggio?

472
00:39:05,918 --> 00:39:08,456
The wop? Yeah, real tough monkey.

473
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,872
-You killed him.
-Did l?

474
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,257
Well, if l did, he asked for it.

475
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:17,176
The Army's going to get you
sooner or later, Fatso.

476
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,715
But before they do,
l want a piece of you myself.

477
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:23,762
l figured that.

478
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,104
See this knife?

479
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,727
lt's the one you pulled on Maggio.

480
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:07,196
What's happened?

481
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:14,160
lt's all right.

482
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:18,543
Don't worry.

483
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,552
l ain't gonna die.

484
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:40,153
First Platoon present and accounted for!

485
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,781
Second Platoon all accounted for!

486
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,989
Third Platoon all present
and accounted for!

487
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:46,491
Fourth Platoon all present
and accounted for!

488
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:48,157
Fifth Platoon all accounted for!

489
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:50,324
Sixth Platoon all accounted for!

490
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,580
Company, dismissed!

491
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:00,382
Prewitt's still absent.

492
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,385
Makes three days now.

493
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,260
How long are you gonna carry him present,
Top?

494
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:11,061
l just mention it.

495
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:13,138
Well, don't mention it.

496
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:22,649
''Upon observing these incidents,
an investigation was made...

497
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,689
''...by the lnspector General's Department
over a period of several months.

498
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:28,654
''lt was found that Captain Holmes...

499
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,613
''...has been guilty of indefensible cruelty
to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

500
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:36,623
''As mentioned, this included instigation
of wholly unauthorised tactics...

501
00:42:36,796 --> 00:42:40,959
''...to force the soldier
to join the interregiment boxing team.''

502
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:47,929
l'm waiting for your reply.

503
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:49,844
l haven't any, sir.

504
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:56,432
First thing l learned in the Army
was that an officer takes care of his men.

505
00:42:56,524 --> 00:42:59,193
lt seems to be the first thing you forgot.

506
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,605
My only regret is...

507
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:04,110
...we have to keep you in uniform
till a court-martial is concluded.

508
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:07,653
lf there were any way
to avoid a court-martial, sir.

509
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:12,577
There is one alternative, General,
if you are so disposed:

510
00:43:12,832 --> 00:43:16,912
A resignation for the good of the service
under Army regulations.

511
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,837
Write a letter of resignation.

512
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,087
Have it on my desk this afternoon.

513
00:43:22,216 --> 00:43:23,877
As far as l'm concerned...

514
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,970
...the quicker you're out,
the better for everybody...

515
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:29,254
...especially the Army.

516
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,391
That's all, Holmes.

517
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:42,273
l know what's been going on in this outfit.

518
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:44,769
l know how far some of you
have been out of line.

519
00:43:45,114 --> 00:43:48,068
lf you want to remain non-coms,
you'd better snap into it.

520
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:49,487
And another thing:

521
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:53,320
From now on,
no man will earn his stripes by boxing.

522
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,867
-Get rid of those.
-Yes, sir.

523
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,914
Dismissed.

524
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:08,215
-About Sergeant Galovitch.
-Yes, sir.

525
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:11,139
Bust him. Sergeant Galovitch
is now Private Galovitch.

526
00:44:11,223 --> 00:44:13,714
Put him in charge of the latrine.

527
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:15,173
What are you grinning at?

528
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,934
l think the Company Commander
made a wise decision, sir.

529
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,939
Company G, Captain Ross.

530
00:44:24,737 --> 00:44:26,065
Just a minute.

531
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:29,109
-lt's for you, Sergeant.
-Thank you, sir.

532
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:32,948
Yes, sir.

533
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:38,750
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

534
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:41,284
What?

535
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:43,835
l've got to see you, Milt. lt's important.

536
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,961
Okay, l'll get away somehow.

537
00:44:49,095 --> 00:44:52,179
Sure, that'd be fine, yeah.

538
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:55,344
l'll be there in about an hour. Right.

539
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:03,399
He's being sent back to the States,
sailing next week, and wants me to go.

540
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:04,564
What will we do?

541
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:09,780
When do you think
you'll get your commission?

542
00:45:12,618 --> 00:45:16,616
l didn't put it in.
l filled it out, but l didn't sign it.

543
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,120
l took it out of my desk a do<i>z</i>en times,
but l couldn't sign it.

544
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:22,575
Why?

545
00:45:24,172 --> 00:45:26,709
-But it was the plan--
-l know.

546
00:45:26,882 --> 00:45:28,341
lt's been weeks.

547
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,714
You can't say you'll do a thing
and not do it.

548
00:45:30,803 --> 00:45:32,084
Karen, listen to me.

549
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:35,595
Why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you tell me?

550
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:38,553
Be back in a minute.

551
00:45:41,189 --> 00:45:44,059
Sorry, l thought you were somebody else.

552
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:53,654
l thought it was a guy from our company,
Prewitt, the kid l told you about.

553
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:56,578
He got mixed up with a girl
at the New Congress Club.

554
00:45:56,662 --> 00:45:59,616
He's AWOL, probably in lots of trouble.

555
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,911
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a cra<i>z</i>y, no-good<i>....</i>

556
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:09,250
Karen, l'm no officer. l'm an enlisted man.

557
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:10,790
l can't be anything else.

558
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:13,376
lf l try to be an officer,
l'll be putting on an act.

559
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:17,089
l just can't do it. Please don't ask me why.

560
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,220
l know why.

561
00:46:21,229 --> 00:46:23,470
You don't have to become an officer now...

562
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:26,102
...now that Dana's out of the Army.

563
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:28,689
You just don't want to marry me.

564
00:46:28,778 --> 00:46:31,351
You're already married to the Army.

565
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,274
l love you, Karen.

566
00:46:38,746 --> 00:46:40,406
l know.

567
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,710
l don't want you to go back to Holmes.

568
00:46:44,877 --> 00:46:47,451
l don't want to, either. But l am.

569
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,079
There's nothing else for me to do.

570
00:46:50,383 --> 00:46:53,383
lt's no good with us, Milt.
lt could never have been any good.

571
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:55,177
Hiding, sneaking.

572
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:57,388
lt had to wear out.

573
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:02,685
Good-bye, Sergeant.

574
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:05,976
-Thanks.
-lt ain't good-bye, it's<i>....</i>

575
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,776
We'll see each other again, somewhere.

576
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,862
Of course we will. Somewhere.

577
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:29,744
Here it is.

578
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,330
Got it on the inside page already.

579
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,380
''Still no clue...

580
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:37,879
''...in the fatal stabbing
of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson.''

581
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:40,591
Did you hear me?

582
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:46,225
Are you trying to set a new world's record?

583
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:50,563
Yeah, as a matter of fact, l am.

584
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:54,269
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt...

585
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,858
...holder of the new world's record.

586
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:16,417
-Everything all right, Top?
-Great.

587
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:20,131
This is a beautiful meal to put in front
of a guy on a Sunday morning.

588
00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:21,884
Congratulations.

589
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:38,322
They sure look pretty
over them mountains.

590
00:48:38,409 --> 00:48:39,785
Don't they, though?

591
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:51,535
Sounds like they're dynamiting
down at Wheeler Field.

592
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:55,581
Mighty ambitious.
Sunday morning before 8:00?

593
00:49:07,939 --> 00:49:11,522
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!

594
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:13,981
l've seen the red circles on the--

595
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:47,343
Get out of here. Hurry up! Go!

596
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:53,724
<i>This is a real attack, not a manoeuvre.</i>

597
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:56,144
<i>The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.</i>

598
00:49:56,237 --> 00:49:58,693
<i>Please keep in your homes.</i>
<i>Do not go on the streets.</i>

599
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:00,110
<i>This is a real attack.</i>

600
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:03,734
<i>Japanese planes are bombing</i>
<i>our Naval and Army installations.</i>

601
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,243
-Quiet down!
-At ease!

602
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:13,492
Non-coms, get BARs and ammunition
from the supply room. Get up on the roof.

603
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:14,619
Anderson!

604
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,966
You're in charge of the loading detail.
Get moving.

605
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:20,010
Rest of you men, listen to me.

606
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:23,754
Every man get his rifle, go to his bunk
and stay there. And l mean...

607
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:25,757
...stay there!

608
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,604
Shut up! You'll get your ears shot off
if you go outside.

609
00:50:30,689 --> 00:50:34,603
You'll get plenty of chances to be heroes
with Japs in your lap before night.

610
00:50:34,776 --> 00:50:37,349
Now get moving, we're wasting time!

611
00:50:41,324 --> 00:50:45,369
lnto the kitchen and make a pot of coffee.
Wait a minute, a barrel of coffee!

612
00:51:05,848 --> 00:51:08,553
l can't issue live ammunition
without a signed order.

613
00:51:08,643 --> 00:51:11,514
-The Captain ain't here, jerk!
-Sorry. No order, no ammo.

614
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:13,478
-What's the matter?
-l got my orders!

615
00:51:13,565 --> 00:51:16,138
Army regulations state that l can't--

616
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,322
You blind? Give me the key!

617
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:25,028
-l got to obey orders, Top.
-l'll see you get a medal!

618
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:27,656
-Bust it down, boys!
-l warned you!

619
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:52,928
Don't go out, Warden, you'll get killed!

620
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:55,642
Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!

621
00:52:22,592 --> 00:52:24,335
Give them a hand with this ammo!

622
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:25,797
Put that stuff over there.

623
00:52:31,976 --> 00:52:34,514
Watch your fire, boys,
and lead those planes!

624
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,657
Friday's gone cra<i>z</i>y!
He's blowing the Cavalry Charge!

625
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:02,584
Here they come, boys!

626
00:53:34,497 --> 00:53:36,324
l got him, Pete! l got him!

627
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:38,451
l got him!

628
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:49,167
<i>The danger of an invasion</i>
<i>continues to exist.</i>

629
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:52,465
<i>lnfantry from Schofield Barracks</i>
<i>moved out within a few hours...</i>

630
00:53:52,557 --> 00:53:54,431
<i>...and have manned beach positions.</i>

631
00:53:54,517 --> 00:53:56,012
<i>This is no manoeuvre.</i>

632
00:53:56,144 --> 00:53:58,136
<i>This is the real McCoy.</i>

633
00:53:58,438 --> 00:54:00,098
<i>Look out for falling shrapnel.</i>

634
00:54:00,398 --> 00:54:01,809
<i>Keep under cover.</i>

635
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,648
<i>Blackout and curfew restrictions</i>
<i>will be rigidly enforced.</i>

636
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,863
<i>Stay in your homes.</i>
<i>Don't use the telephone.</i>

637
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:13,650
<i>Rest assured that immediate relay</i>
<i>to you of any and all information....</i>

638
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:15,862
We've been to Queen's Hospital
giving blood.

639
00:54:15,956 --> 00:54:17,034
The town's a madhouse!

640
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:18,950
A big house was bombed on Kuhio Street.

641
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:21,877
The drugstore down on McNully
and King is smashed flat!

642
00:54:22,086 --> 00:54:23,545
A man and his wife were killed.

643
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:27,918
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Listen to this carefully and keep calm.</i>

644
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:31,218
<i>The danger of an invasion</i>
<i>continues to exist.</i>

645
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:35,053
<i>And the planes have been identified</i>
<i>as Japanese planes.</i>

646
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:38,182
Who do they think they're fighting?

647
00:54:38,353 --> 00:54:42,018
They're picking trouble
with the best Army in the world.

648
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:44,645
Where you going?

649
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:48,648
l gotta get back to the company.

650
00:54:48,863 --> 00:54:51,484
The company? But why?

651
00:54:51,992 --> 00:54:53,106
Why?

652
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:56,108
But you can't. You're not well yet.

653
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:59,117
You're AWOL.
They'll throw you in the stockade.

654
00:54:59,624 --> 00:55:02,993
They'll be throwing them out
of the stockade. They need everyone.

655
00:55:03,085 --> 00:55:04,710
But your side'll open up.

656
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:07,793
They'll find out you killed that soldier.

657
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:11,175
Once l report in to the company,
they'll take care of me.

658
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:12,885
l'll be all right once l get back.

659
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:16,387
But you'll never make it!
There's patrols all over!

660
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:19,179
l'll make it. l know a shortcut.

661
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:24,014
Prew, stay till morning.

662
00:55:24,107 --> 00:55:26,812
Maybe if you stay till morning
you'll change your mind.

663
00:55:34,409 --> 00:55:36,283
Prew, don't go!

664
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:38,410
l'll do anything you want.

665
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:43,198
We can go back to the States together,
we can even get married.

666
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:49,708
lf you go now,
l'll never see you again, l know it.

667
00:55:50,425 --> 00:55:51,587
l'm sorry.

668
00:55:56,848 --> 00:55:59,303
What do you want to go back
to the Army for?

669
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:02,310
What did the Army do for you
besides treat you like dirt...

670
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,269
...and give you one awful going over?

671
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:08,519
Get your friend killed!
What do you want to go back for?

672
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:11,225
What do l want to go back for?
l'm a soldier.

673
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,398
A soldier! A regular.
From the regular Army!

674
00:56:15,491 --> 00:56:17,116
A 30-year man!

675
00:56:18,953 --> 00:56:22,903
l got to turn off the lights,
'cause of the blackout outside.

676
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:39,509
They say they've seen parachutists
land up in the hills.

677
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,927
l ain't worried about them.

678
00:56:41,017 --> 00:56:42,926
Saboteurs is what worries me.

679
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:46,186
l bet they're operating
all over these islands.

680
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,377
Halt!

681
00:58:03,266 --> 00:58:04,297
Halt!

682
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:17,352
Halt!

683
00:58:53,983 --> 00:58:56,308
Do you know this man, Sergeant?

684
00:58:56,486 --> 00:58:57,814
Yes, sir.

685
00:58:58,279 --> 00:59:00,402
He didn't have any regular identification.

686
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,945
They found a card on him with his name.

687
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:05,110
Seems to be membership of a club:

688
00:59:05,245 --> 00:59:07,154
The New Congress Club.

689
00:59:07,538 --> 00:59:10,540
You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.

690
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,212
Was this man a friend of yours?

691
00:59:15,338 --> 00:59:19,418
Yes, sir. He must've been trying to reach
our company position up the beach here.

692
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:21,217
Then why didn't he halt?

693
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:24,469
He was always a hardhead, sir,
but he was a good soldier.

694
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:27,088
He loved the Army
more than any soldier l ever knew.

695
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:30,597
l see. l'm sorry, Sergeant.

696
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:48,908
You just couldn't play it smart, could you?

697
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:53,413
All you had to do was box, but no,
not you, you hardhead.

698
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:58,623
Funny thing is, there ain't gonna be
any boxing championships this year.

699
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:07,962
What's the matter?
Ain't you ever seen a dead man?

700
01:00:08,057 --> 01:00:11,224
Let's get this body out of here!
We ain't got all night!

701
01:00:33,124 --> 01:00:35,200
lt's very beautiful, isn't it?

702
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:43,498
l think it's the most beautiful place
l ever saw in my life.

703
01:00:45,052 --> 01:00:47,970
l can almost see where l worked from here.

704
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:53,559
There's a legend:

705
01:00:54,813 --> 01:00:58,478
lf they float in toward shore,
you'll come back some day.

706
01:00:59,442 --> 01:01:01,067
lf they float out to sea, you won't.

707
01:01:06,949 --> 01:01:09,025
l won't come back.

708
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:13,330
My fianc was killed on December 7.

709
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:16,243
l'm sorry.

710
01:01:17,127 --> 01:01:19,036
He was a bomber pilot.

711
01:01:19,253 --> 01:01:22,208
He tried to taxi his plane
to the edge of the apron.

712
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,748
The Japs made a direct hit on it.

713
01:01:25,593 --> 01:01:28,345
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

714
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:31,047
He was awarded the Silver Star.

715
01:01:32,142 --> 01:01:34,430
They sent it to his mother.

716
01:01:34,644 --> 01:01:36,684
She wrote me she wanted me to have it.

717
01:01:37,355 --> 01:01:39,395
That's very fine of her.

718
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:43,276
They're very fine people. Southern people.

719
01:01:44,195 --> 01:01:46,484
He was named after a general.

720
01:01:47,323 --> 01:01:48,948
Robert E. Lee...

721
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:50,857
...Prewitt.

722
01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:54,068
Who?

723
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:59,206
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

724
01:02:02,005 --> 01:02:03,665
lsn't that a silly old name?
