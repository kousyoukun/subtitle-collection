1
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:48,708
One, two, three, four.

2
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,197
Hey, Maggio! Hello!

3
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,074
Hiya, Prew.

4
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:43,874
What are you doing over here?

5
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,111
Transferred over from Fort Shafter.

6
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,711
-You quit the Bugle Corps?
-Yup.

7
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,113
For here?

8
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,837
I didn't pick it.

9
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,070
You made a very bad mistake.

10
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,394
This outfit, they can give back Custer.

11
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,389
Yeah?

12
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,596
Captain ain't in yet.

13
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,677
I'll look around.

14
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,634
What do you think you're doing?

15
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,198
-What's your name?
-Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

16
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,348
I heard about you.

17
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,830
I heard about you, too, Sergeant.

18
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,791
This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.

19
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,518
You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself
before sundown.

20
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,874
Put up your cue and come along.

21
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,995
Grand went to the hospital yesterday.
You put him in the sick book?

22
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,593
-Didn't have time.
-You're the company clerk, Mazzioli.

23
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,115
The medics returned the sick book
late yesterday. I'll do it now.

24
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,633
Thanks, I already done it for you.

25
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,553
You're the best bugler
they got over at Shafter.

26
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,109
-You're the best bugler on this island.
-That's true.

27
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,472
I feel for you, pal.

28
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:22,551
But from my position,
I can't quite reach you.

29
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,868
Ten-hut!

30
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,348
At ease.

31
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,236
-'Morning, sir.
-'Morning, men.

32
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,674
Anything special for me?
I've only a few minutes.

33
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,715
Yes, sir. New man here.

34
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,551
Oh, yes. Come in.

35
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:51,708
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, reporting
to the Company Commander, as ordered.

36
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,472
At ease. Where's that service record?

37
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,397
"Born in Kentucky.
Enlisted first at Fort Meyer, Virginia.

38
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,549
"Bugle Corps, First Bugler."

39
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,076
Prewitt, I always make it a policy
to talk to my new men.

40
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,229
Now, I have a fine, smooth-running outfit.

41
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,552
If I like a soldier, he can become
a non-commissioned officer quickly.

42
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:16,070
But he has to show me
that he's got it on the ball.

43
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:18,195
What trouble were you in,
in the Bugle Corps?

44
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,314
No trouble, sir.

45
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,031
What made you transfer out, then?

46
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,714
It was a personal matter.

47
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,037
-Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
-Why, yes, sir.

48
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,434
Prewitt, you was a corporal
in the Bugle Corps.

49
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,876
You took a bust to buck private
to transfer to an infantry outfit. Why?

50
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,395
Because you like to hike, or was it
because you couldn't stand to bugle?

51
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,398
It was a personal matter.

52
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,113
That's up to the Company Commander
to decide.

53
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,188
Well?

54
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,475
I was First Bugler for two years.

55
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,676
The Top Kick had a friend
who transferred in from another outfit.

56
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,034
The next day he was made
First Bugler over me.

57
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:53,952
I was a better bugler.

58
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,633
And you asked out on account of that?

59
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,879
Maybe it ain't sensible,
but that's the reason.

60
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,757
His feelings were hurt.
Kids they send us now!

61
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,394
We'll get your stripes back for you,
maybe an extra one for good measure.

62
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,674
-Know why you're assigned to G Company?
-No, sir.

63
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,634
I pulled a few strings. I'm the regimental
boxing coach, you know.

64
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,474
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,478
I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl
year before last. You should have won.

66
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,548
Thank you, sir.

67
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,798
Our regiment got beaten in the finals
last December, but I mean to win this year.

68
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,710
All I've needed is a top middleweight.

69
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,997
I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.

70
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:31,468
Quit fighting? When? What for?

71
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,630
Well, over a year ago.

72
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,868
Maybe you heard about what happened
with Dixie Wells?

73
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,073
-You mean that fellow that got hurt?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,877
Yes, I heard about that. It's too bad.

75
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,553
I can understand how you feel,
but those things happen.

76
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,630
That's why I decided I would quit, sir.

77
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:51,230
You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed.

78
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,834
Our fighting program
is the best morale builder we have.

79
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,833
I've got a mighty sour company bugler.
How'd you like the job?

80
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,988
Not if it means fighting.

81
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,869
Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire
a reputation as a lone wolf.

82
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,551
You should know that in the Army
it's not the individual that counts.

83
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,188
You'll find that we won't put
any pressure on you in my outfit.

84
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:23,396
Just don't make any mistakes in it,
that's all.

85
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,915
I'm going to town.
Anything else, Sergeant?

86
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,955
Company fund report's due tomorrow.

87
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,599
-You make it out. Is that all?
-No, sir.

88
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,635
Whatever it is, you fix it up.

89
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,233
If anything has to go in this afternoon,
sign my name.

90
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,435
-I won't be back.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,557
He'd strangle in his own spit
if I wasn't here to swab his throat out.

92
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,948
Come on.

93
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,832
You been in the Army what now?
Five years? Five and a half?

94
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,908
Yeah.

95
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,991
Don't you think it's about time
you got smart?

96
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,191
You know what you did just now,
turning down Dynamite Holmes?

97
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,917
You put your head in the noose.

98
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,950
Things are soft for a boxer in this outfit.

99
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,950
Otherwise, you better know how to soldier.

100
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,075
I can soldier with any man.

101
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,668
This place is getting to be like
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

102
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:38,437
-Who's that?
-She's Captain Holmes' wife.

103
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,678
You'll fight, Prewitt, because
Captain Holmes wants to be Major Holmes.

104
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,751
He's got an idea he'll make it
if he gets a winning team.

105
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,915
If you don't do it for him, do it for me.

106
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,830
'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?

107
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,276
More he's happy, the less he bothers me,
and the better I run this company.

108
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,953
So, we know where we stand,
don't we, kid?

109
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,270
I know where I stand.
A man don't go his own way he's nothing.

110
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,230
Maybe back in the days of the pioneers
a man could go his own way.

111
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,594
But today, you got to play ball.

112
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,228
Leva!

113
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,436
Can't I once find you in the supply room
working with both hands?

114
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,987
I can't do no better
on what you people pay me.

115
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,798
Draw this man some supplies.

116
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,395
G Company squad room is on the top floor.
Take your bags then come here.

117
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,757
Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.
Save you making four or five trips.

118
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,828
Thanks.

119
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,037
I just hate to see energy wasted.
Besides, you'll be needing yours.

120
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,590
Looks like a good man.

121
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,627
I know his type. He's a hardhead.

122
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,114
Her and them sweaters.

123
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,711
I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.

124
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,076
Not her, Top. She knows the score.
Like I been telling you.

125
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,638
Is that right?

126
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,629
Not around here, but when I soldiered
at Fort Bliss, I heard plenty about this lady.

127
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:10,871
-You did?
-Okay, not me.

128
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,349
But I know some of the guys
she played around with, so don't tell me.

129
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:17,078
I'm not telling you. You're telling me.

130
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,309
-Good morning, Sergeant.
-'Morning, ma'am.

131
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,514
I'm looking for my husband.

132
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,188
Captain Holmes just went into town.
On business.

133
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,596
He was to have left some things for me.
Do you know about them?

134
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,513
No, I don't, ma'am.
Anything I can do for you?

135
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,512
No, thanks.

136
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,989
I'd be glad to help, ma'am.

137
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,310
My husband's been telling me
a lot about you, Sergeant.

138
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,872
He says you're very efficient.

139
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,748
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,674
What is it that makes you
so efficient, Sergeant?

141
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,352
I was born smart, ma'am.

142
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,632
I love that.

143
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,550
Well, good-bye, Sergeant.

144
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,836
Man, she sure is one, ain't she?

145
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,034
One what?

146
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,347
One woman.

147
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,077
I've seen better.

148
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,074
Karen?

149
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,667
-Sorry I'm late.
-It doesn't matter.

150
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,508
I got tied up with General Slater.
I bumped into him in the Officers' Club.

151
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,238
Yeah? What did the General have to say?

152
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,957
Success, he said.

153
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,792
Success in war, success in peacetime.

154
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,593
Not a word about my promotion.

155
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,837
Sometimes I think the old man's
just waiting to ship me down.

156
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,672
Less time buttering generals
and more with your company...

157
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,116
-...maybe you'd get that promotion.
-The company takes care of itself.

158
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,952
I went over there today looking for you.

159
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:08,156
I had some business to attend to
at Kaneohe.

160
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,636
That was all right, wasn't it?

161
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,038
Of course.

162
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,630
I've no right to inquire into your actions.
That was our agreement.

163
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,038
Then why bring it up?

164
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,907
Because I wanted you to know I'm not
as stupid as you maintain all women are.

165
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,591
Now, just what does that mean?

166
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,112
What are you accusing me of now?

167
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,234
Of nothing.

168
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:28,277
It's no longer my business
how many women you go out with.

169
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:31,271
But I wish you could just be honest
about it once.

170
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,827
No reason I should try to hide anything,
is there...

171
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,353
...the way things are between us now?

172
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,711
What right have you
to always be accusing me?

173
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,467
What right?

174
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,708
Are you going back to that again?

175
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,394
How long will it be, I wonder,
before I'm allowed to live that down?

176
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,675
How many times must I say
it was an accident?

177
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,117
Please, Dana.

178
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,228
I'm going to bed.

179
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,154
Please get out of my bedroom.

180
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,355
Captain Holmes says you don't want
to come out and fight for us.

181
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,633
That's right.

182
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,836
We thought we'd buy you a beer
and talk it over.

183
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,628
We're the company boxers.

184
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,878
I figured.

185
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:54,195
What I wouldn't give to have this guy
in a corner poolroom in my hometown!

186
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,957
If you box as good as you used to,
we'd be a cinch this year.

187
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,317
You ain't forget, division champs
get ten-day furloughs, did you, son?

188
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,315
I'm Ike Galovitch.
Platoon guide of your platoon.

189
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,788
And don't think
you're a tough guy, Prewitt.

190
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,394
You no talk now, but out in the field
with us you sing different song.

191
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:20,596
He don't have to fight if he don't want
without being kicked around.

192
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,158
We're playing pool. Take off.

193
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,877
-You want busted head, Maggio?
-No.

194
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,189
Then keep your big nose out altogether.

195
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,588
Training starts next week.
Pick up your stuff--

196
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,274
Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you...

197
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,275
...I ain't fighting. I quit fighting!

198
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,514
You guys want to put the screws on,
go right ahead.

199
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,829
I can take anything you can dish out.

200
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,398
Okay, Prewitt.

201
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,793
Thanks.

202
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,149
I just hate to see a good guy
get it in the gut.

203
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,831
You'd better get used to it, kid.

204
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,956
You'll probably see a lot of it
before you die.

205
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,518
You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?

206
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,513
You know anything in Army regulation
says I got to box?

207
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,472
Every boxer in this outfit's a non-com.

208
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,513
I guess you've never seen
a bunch of them get together...

209
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,952
...and give a man "The Treatment."

210
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,387
What do you mean "chick"? She's 45.

211
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,878
She's still too young for you.

212
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,235
I'm a better man than you any day
and don't forget it.

213
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,308
I won't forget it.

214
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,715
What's the deal with him, anyway?

215
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,397
With Warden. I don't figure him.

216
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,027
Warden?

217
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,395
He ain't like the others.

218
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,515
He'll make it tough on you.

219
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:54,911
But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,
and he won't come over it.

220
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,997
You don't see many top kicks
like him no more.

221
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:02,148
He was with the 15th in Shanghai
when they saw their action.

222
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,514
I heard about it
down in the Philippines, even.

223
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,636
All I know is,
he's the best soldier I ever saw.

224
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,156
Count cadence, count!

225
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,754
One, two, three, four.

226
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,636
Prewitt! Get in step!

227
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,997
Hut! Hut!

228
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,199
Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic!
Get in step!

229
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,839
Hut! Hut! Hut!

230
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,994
Halt!

231
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:59,233
Left face!

232
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,070
Prewitt! One step forward. March!

233
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,275
You march like a drunken gooney bird.
I got to teach you how to drill. Stay here.

234
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,919
Platoon, dismissed!

235
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,907
Detail, right face!

236
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,469
Detail, forward march!

237
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,549
Half left march!

238
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,551
Half right march!

239
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,714
Assemble your weapons.

240
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,197
All right, start.

241
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,592
A rifle's your best friend.

242
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,995
In the case it jams in combat,
could mean life or death.

243
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,118
You got to learn to strip them down
and put them back together, blindfolded.

244
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,917
Your rear sight's way off!

245
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,633
You'd be 50 feet off-target at 300 yards.

246
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,229
That's what happens when a soldier
don't know how to assemble his rifle.

247
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,392
Seven laps around the track, double time.
Keep the rifle at high port!

248
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,150
Wide open, huh, Prewitt?

249
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,953
Maybe seven more laps
will teach you to watch yourself.

250
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,951
Are you crazy? I saw what you did.

251
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,113
Nothing but trouble.
Better keep your mind off her.

252
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:32,157
What do you wanna do,
wind up in Leavenworth?

253
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:47,197
I won't be back in time to take retreat.
Or reveille, either.

254
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,350
All work and no play, Sergeant.

255
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:55,631
All you do is sit around
sweating over papers.

256
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,028
There are other things in the world
beside work.

257
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,110
You ought to get out
more yourself, Warden.

258
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,474
I've been considering it.

259
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,074
Well, I'm going.
I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.

260
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,833
It'll be here when you get back, sir.

261
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,597
Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

262
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,557
You'd better step inside or you'll get wet.

263
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,353
I am wet.

264
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,116
If you're looking for the Captain,
he isn't here.

265
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,395
And if I'm not looking for him?

266
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,957
He still isn't here.

267
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,712
I'm looking for him.
You know where he is?

268
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,878
I haven't the slightest idea.
Perhaps he's in town on business.

269
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:10,157
That's the way you put it
the other day, isn't it?

270
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,470
I got some papers
it's important for him to sign.

271
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,710
I'll try phoning him at the club.

272
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,108
-Maybe he's there.
-Don't do that.

273
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,032
I never like to disturb a man
when he's drinking.

274
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,629
I could use a drink myself.

275
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,315
Do you wanna ask me in?

276
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,717
The liquor's there, Sergeant.
In the cabinet.

277
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,554
You're taking an awful chance, you know.

278
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,278
My maid is liable to be home anytime.

279
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,837
No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.

280
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,916
You think of everything, don't you?

281
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,638
I try. In my position, you have to.

282
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,118
Are these really important?

283
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:16,828
Yes. But not important
they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.

284
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,557
I got copies at the office.

285
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:25,312
So it won't be much work to fix them up.

286
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:28,431
That's what I like about you, Sergeant.
You have confidence.

287
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,475
It's also what I dislike about you.

288
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,197
It's not confidence, ma'am.

289
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,712
It's honesty.

290
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,359
I hate to see a beautiful woman
going to waste.

291
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,117
"Waste" did you say?

292
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:42,235
There's a subject
I might tell you something about.

293
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,359
I know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.

294
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:48,476
You're probably not even remotely aware
of some of them.

295
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,470
Would you like to hear?

296
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,916
For instance,
what about the house without a child?

297
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,990
There's one sort for you.

298
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,750
Then there's another....

299
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,189
You're doing fine, Sergeant.

300
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,517
My husband's off somewhere,
it's raining and we're both drinking now.

301
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,669
You've probably only got one thing wrong:

302
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,511
The lady herself.

303
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,989
The lady's not what she seems.

304
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,198
She's a washout,
if you know what I mean...

305
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,073
...and I'm sure you know what I mean.

306
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,078
You gonna cry?

307
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,756
Not if I can help it.

308
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,237
What are you doing?

309
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,952
I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?

310
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,436
I don't know, Sergeant.

311
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,631
I don't know.

312
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,516
-Speed it up.
-I'm speeding.

313
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,918
"Payday"

314
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,749
All right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?
Knock it off.

315
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:36,833
Angelo! A dollar he's wrong, coming up.

316
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,074
Sorry, I already won my bankroll
in the latrine.

317
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,468
Besides, it's a penny-ante game.

318
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,352
Come on, buddy boy, we're going to town.

319
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,675
Look, don't let them get your goat.

320
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,876
We dress up in civvies
and we're as good as the rest of the world.

321
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,150
Here, wear this.

322
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,514
My sister sent it to me.

323
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,829
She buys everything too big.

324
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,790
Look, first we hit a few bars, see?

325
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,916
Then we go to a place where I'm
a member: The New Congress Club.

326
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,712
Girls!

327
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,517
Any prejudices against girls?

328
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,230
That's what I thought.

329
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:41,918
Well, it looks like you're all primed
for a big night.

330
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,114
Hello, Stark.

331
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,713
-You want some company?
-No, thanks. All tied up.

332
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,628
Leva says you've been eyeing the Captain's
wife like a hound at hunting.

333
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:52,392
He has, huh?
What else did that character tell you?

334
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:54,869
She took up with a lot of men
back at Fort Bliss.

335
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,427
I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.

336
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,237
This ain't no story.

337
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,874
Because I was one of them myself.

338
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,438
Not for long, though.

339
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,669
Sure is something strange
about that woman.

340
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,670
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

341
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,313
See you.

342
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,828
Hello.

343
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,188
-I didn't think you were coming.
-Why not? I ain't late.

344
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,157
No, I guess you're not.

345
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,157
But I got here a little early.
I must have been over-anxious.

346
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:32,948
-You weren't, though, were you?
-I stopped along the way for a few drinks.

347
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,995
You chose a lovely spot for our meeting.

348
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,673
I've had three chances to be picked up
in five minutes.

349
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,636
That's par for the course around here.

350
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,755
Well, I don't care for it.

351
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,075
I never went in much for back-alley loving.

352
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,592
Take it easy.

353
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,396
You probably think I'm a tramp.

354
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,191
What makes you think
I'd think a thing like that?

355
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,553
Don't try to be gallant.

356
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:58,268
If you think this is a mistake,
come right out and say so.

357
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,752
Well, I guess it's about time for me
to be getting home, isn't it?

358
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,234
Isn't it?

359
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,833
What's the matter?
What started all this, anyway?

360
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,274
You think I'd be here
if I thought it was a mistake?

361
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,591
Risking 20 years in Leavenworth
for a date with the Commander's wife?

362
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,592
And her acting like Lady Astor's horse,
and all because I got here on time!

363
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,638
On the other hand,
I've got a bathing suit under my dress.

364
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,667
Me, too.

365
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,512
Why, it's Angelo Maggio.

366
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,510
Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

367
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,157
There you are, sweetie-pie.
Dues all paid up.

368
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,988
Who you got playing the piano, a hippo?

369
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,070
Angelo, I don't think I've met your friend.

370
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,115
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

371
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,952
You know how I hate it
when you boys are in this condition.

372
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,028
You see that, buddy boy?

373
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,156
A woman sees a soldier and, like that,
she figures he's drunk.

374
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,753
-You know why?
-Because he is.

375
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,190
Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
with the entertainment business.

376
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,349
A respectable place
must consider its future.

377
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:50,796
Mrs. Kipfer, you have my solemn word
your future will be safe with us.

378
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,149
Angelo is one of my favorites.

379
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,397
Annette, dear, take care of this gentleman
for me, will you, please?

380
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,074
That'll be $4, babyface.

381
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,431
$2 for initiation fee,
$2 for this month's dues.

382
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,554
What do I get for it?

383
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,795
Entitlement to all privileges of the club:

384
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,228
Dancing, snack bar, soft drink bar.

385
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,628
Gentlemanly relaxation
with the opposite gender.

386
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,398
So long as they are gentlemen.
No liquor is permitted.

387
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,275
Got it?

388
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,712
I've got it.

389
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:48,790
Girls, here's some new poison.

390
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,557
This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.

391
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,397
-Nice meeting you.
-Hi, there.

392
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,957
Don't tell me the princess is your style.

393
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,869
This is Suzanne and Roxanne.

394
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,114
Hello, there.

395
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,918
-Would you like to dance, honey?
-Hey!

396
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,471
Much as I adore your company...

397
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,954
...I hope I may be allowed
to tear myself away.

398
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,677
I just saw a few friends at the door.

399
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,434
I can also see that I will be
of no further use to you.

400
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,676
Hi. You busy?

401
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,918
What's your name?

402
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,113
I'm Lorene.

403
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,953
Lorene?

404
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,351
I haven't seen you in here before.

405
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:51,357
I haven't been in here before.

406
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:56,268
My friend brought me.
He and I are stationed out at Schofield.

407
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,515
I didn't think you were a soldier.

408
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,351
What do you mean?

409
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:03,187
-Well, I--
-I'm a 30-year man, in for the whole ride.

410
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,437
I suppose it's different
when a fellow makes a career of it.

411
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,750
Nothing wrong with a soldier
that isn't wrong with everyone else.

412
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,235
I like you just the same.

413
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,874
I liked you the minute
I saw Annette bring you in.

414
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,194
You did?

415
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:22,154
It's funny, I came in and stood there
and saw you sitting over here.

416
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,833
Knock it off, buddy.
Put a mute in that thing.

417
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,797
I'll play as loud as I want, you little wop!

418
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,948
"Little wop"?

419
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,955
Mess with me, fatstuff, I'll bust you up.

420
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,758
You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.

421
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,191
-Wait right here for me, will you?
-Yeah, sure.

422
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,428
I will not have this.

423
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,398
-Mussolini's telling me how to play.
-Busting my eardrums with his noise!

424
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,912
-Let's not be cruel.
-Break it up.

425
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,796
You'll have to go if you can't behave.

426
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,154
Only my friends call me "wop"!

427
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:52,796
-You know who that guy is?
-What do I care?

428
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:53,868
Who is he?

429
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,519
Fatso Judson.
Sergeant of the Guard at the stockade.

430
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,228
Let him alone.

431
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,754
I seen him nearly murder a guy once.
He likes it.

432
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,717
Okay, bullyboy, now you won the war.
Let's dance, huh?

433
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,914
Yeah, we'll dance.

434
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,796
First I got to calm my nerves.

435
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,588
Let's go to a phone booth
where I'll unveil a fifth of whisky...

436
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:17,557
...I have hidden here
under my loose-flowing sports shirt.

437
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:19,391
Don't get hurt, pal.

438
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,232
Your balance has got to be letter-perfect.

439
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,512
I thought you were gonna wait?

440
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,357
Bill was telling me about surfboarding.

441
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,428
Hello, friend.

442
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,153
Just sit down and listen.
He describes it thrillingly.

443
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,991
You know anything about surfboarding?

444
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,115
No, nothing. Not a thing.

445
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:47,595
You must be stationed inland.
At DeRussey I get lots of chances.

446
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,670
Yeah, but we got mountains.

447
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,472
-Know anything about mountain climbing?
-A little bit.

448
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,635
-You a mountain climber?
-No.

449
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,353
-Know about flying a plane?
-I've had a few lessons.

450
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,997
I can't fly, either.

451
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,832
What do you know about deep-sea diving?

452
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,835
Bill, shall we move into another room?

453
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:08,196
Sure. The air in here seems
to have gotten lousy, hasn't it?

454
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,110
-I noticed that.
-Listen, fella.

455
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,871
Come on, let's go.

456
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:15,756
How's the deep-sea diver?

457
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,717
That was a terrible way you acted.

458
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,553
Maybe I was jealous.

459
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:23,788
You're a funny one.

460
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,192
What do you dames want?
To tease a man to death?

461
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,954
Mrs. Kipfer pays us to be nice
to all the boys.

462
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,872
They're all alike. Is it so important?

463
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,634
It is important.
We may seem all alike, we ain't all alike.

464
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,072
I'm sorry.

465
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,678
Look....

466
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,755
Let's go sit up in Mrs. Kipfer's parlor.

467
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,070
She lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special.

468
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,717
I'll go ask her.

469
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,910
-Then you're not mad?
-No, I'm not mad.

470
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:02,151
Because if you're still mad,
I'd just rather we call the whole thing off.

471
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,229
You certainly are a funny one.

472
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:45,075
I never knew it could be like this.

473
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,988
Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

474
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,674
Nobody?

475
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,756
No. Nobody.

476
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:55,954
Not even one? Out of all the men
you've been kissed by?

477
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,837
Now, that'd take some figuring.

478
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,911
How many do you think there have been?

479
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:01,988
I wouldn't know.

480
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,316
-Can't you give me a rough estimate?
-Not without an adding machine.

481
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,196
Do you have
your adding machine with you?

482
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:08,951
I forgot to bring it.

483
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,837
Then I guess you won't find out, will you?

484
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,316
Maybe I already know.

485
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,031
What's the matter?

486
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,388
What are you hinting at?

487
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,874
Why? Is there something to hint at?

488
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:29,391
Maybe there's been a long line
of beach parties.

489
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,668
You must be crazy.

490
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:31,987
Am I?

491
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,639
What about when you and Holmes
were back at Fort Bliss?

492
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,713
Did you ever hear
of a soldier named Stark?

493
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:39,312
Maylon Stark?

494
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,273
Why, yes.

495
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,794
"Why, yes."

496
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,955
You knew him, too, didn't you?

497
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,592
Didn't you?

498
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,077
I had to go and forget
you were like all the rest of them.

499
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,558
Only it's true, ain't it?

500
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,152
Well, ain't it?

501
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,118
Why don't you tell me about it?

502
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,314
Tell me the story.

503
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:11,037
There's always a story.

504
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,512
You don't leave a person anything, do you?

505
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:34,513
Come back here, Sergeant.
I'll tell you the story.

506
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:39,435
You can take it back
to the barracks with you.

507
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:50,076
I'd only been married to Dana two years
when I found out he was cheating.

508
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,469
But by that time, I was pregnant.

509
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,789
I thought I had something to hope for.

510
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,837
I was almost happy
the night the pains began.

511
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:01,192
I remember
Dana was going to an officers' conference.

512
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,754
I told him to get home early,
to bring the doctor.

513
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,990
He might have, if his conference
hadn't been with a hatcheck girl.

514
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,519
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

515
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,715
I was lying on the floor.

516
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:17,390
I begged him to go for the doctor,
but he fell on the couch and passed out.

517
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,153
The baby was born about an hour later.

518
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,116
Of course it was dead.

519
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:23,673
It was a boy.

520
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,757
But they worked over me at the hospital,
fixed me up fine.

521
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:29,558
They even took my appendix out,
threw that in free.

522
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,674
Karen.

523
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:33,557
And one more thing: No more children.

524
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,038
Sure, I went out with men after that.
And if I'd ever found one that--

525
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,549
Karen, listen to me, listen.

526
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:46,073
I know.

527
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,509
Until I met you,
I didn't think it was possible either.

528
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,388
I enlisted too.

529
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:10,437
Came out here on my own
to get away from my hometown in Oregon.

530
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,913
How come?

531
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,151
I had a boyfriend.

532
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:18,716
I was a waitress, and he was
from the richest family in town.

533
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,677
He just married a girl
suitable for his position.

534
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:24,592
After three years of going around with me.

535
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:28,190
A pretty story, isn't it?
Maybe they could write a book about it.

536
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:30,429
They did. Thousands of them.

537
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,075
So I left and went to Seattle.

538
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,389
When I got there
I met a girl back from Hawaii.

539
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,470
She said she'd made a lot of money there.

540
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,277
So I caught the first boat.

541
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,834
I've been here a year and two months.

542
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,637
You don't like it very much, do you?

543
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,795
Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it.

544
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:47,875
Anyway, I won't be here forever.

545
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,348
No. Sure. I mean, why should you?

546
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,038
I got it all figured out.

547
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:55,595
In another year, I'll be back home,
with a stocking full of money.

548
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,113
And I'll be all set for life.

549
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,628
Who is it?

550
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:10,229
I didn't hear no sounds of combat,
so I thought you might want a drink.

551
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:12,196
You've been hogging the whisky, Angelo.

552
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:16,192
Not me, buddy. It's that Sandra.
She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.

553
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,708
I hope there's a cop under that.

554
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,318
Keep pouring.

555
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,235
No, thanks. I don't drink.

556
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,514
I think it's a weakness.

557
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,757
I grant you that.

558
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,514
I don't like weakness. Do you?

559
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,874
No, I don't like weakness.
But I like to drink.

560
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,270
What are you going to do, marry this guy?

561
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,589
You're grinning at him like you're his wife.

562
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,391
Get out of here!

563
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,995
Okay. I'm going.

564
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,469
Back to old long-legged Sandra.

565
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,027
I love them tall. Acres and acres.

566
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,030
Enjoy yourself, paisan.

567
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,593
You need this more than I do.

568
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,949
Tomorrow you'll be back
with "The Treatment."

569
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:19,111
What does he mean?

570
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,752
That was nice before.

571
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,750
The way you snuggled up in front of him.

572
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,591
What's "The Treatment"?

573
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,115
Some of the guys putting me
over the jumps 'cause I don't want to fight.

574
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,029
Fight?

575
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:35,037
Yeah. On the boxing team.

576
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,758
I don't want to box.
I don't even want to think about it.

577
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,477
Why should you have to box?

578
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:43,908
Well, see, I used to fight, middleweight.

579
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:47,228
I was pretty good, and they know it.

580
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,638
Well, anyway....

581
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,357
Well, come on. Tell me. I want to hear.

582
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:56,349
Well, the thing is, see....

583
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,673
I used to work out with this guy,
Dixie Wells.

584
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:01,835
He's a real good friend of mine.

585
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:05,036
He loved to box.
People on the outside had their eye on him.

586
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,316
He was gonna come out of the Army
and go right up to the top.

587
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,191
Well, one afternoon...

588
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,395
...he and I were sparring in the gym.

589
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,913
You know, kind of friendly-like.

590
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,509
He must have been set pretty flat
on his feet...

591
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,591
...'cause I caught him...

592
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,309
...with a no-more-than-ordinary right cross.

593
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:33,317
He didn't get up. He didn't move.

594
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:35,949
He was in a coma for a week.

595
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,190
Finally, he did pull out of it.

596
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,235
Only, the thing was, he was blind.

597
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,268
I went to see him at the hospital
a couple of times.

598
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,629
Finally, I just couldn't go back.

599
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,348
The last time he and I started talking
about fighting and....

600
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:01,591
He started to cry.

601
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:07,111
Seeing tears coming out of those eyes
that couldn't see anything....

602
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,998
I thought I ought to tell you.

603
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,956
Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.

604
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,110
From now on, it's no holds barred.

605
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:40,998
They aim to run you
right into the stockade if they got to.

606
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,307
Let them.

607
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,711
I'll help you as much as I can.

608
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,190
But I can't go too far out on a limb.

609
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:48,997
I ain't risking losing my stripes.

610
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,398
I like this outfit.

611
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:53,710
So do I. That's funny, ain't it?

612
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:55,551
Yeah, that is funny.

613
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:03,950
Keep going in a straight line, Prewitt.

614
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:07,832
Keep going!

615
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:16,430
All right, that's enough.

616
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,795
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

617
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:28,794
Time!

618
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:47,149
Clean up the mess, Prewitt.

619
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,835
Hurry it up.
You're on fatigue detail, not vacation.

620
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,832
Come on, clean it up!

621
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:06,236
Clean it up yourself!

622
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:08,028
What?

623
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,314
You heard me.
Rub your own nose in it a while.

624
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:13,789
Prewitt, you know better than talk back
to a non-commissioned officer.

625
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:18,117
Yes, sir, but I've never liked being spit on,
not even by a non-commissioned officer.

626
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:20,196
You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.

627
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:23,032
I don't think so.
Sergeant Galovitch owes me an apology.

628
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,598
Corporal Peluso?

629
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:27,637
Have this man roll a full field pack,
extra shoes and helmet.

630
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:30,438
Take a bicycle and hike him up
to Kole Kole Pass and back.

631
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,635
-Then bring him to me.
-Yes, sir.

632
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:34,357
All right, Prewitt, let's go.

633
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:35,554
Time!

634
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:47,151
Hold it a minute.

635
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:52,476
Go ahead and have a cigarette.

636
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:54,515
I don't like this any more than you do.

637
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:55,793
Thanks.

638
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:02,628
I take it you're ready to apologize
to Sergeant Galovitch now?

639
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:04,437
No, sir, I'm not.

640
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:08,392
Peluso, take him up there again.

641
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:11,912
Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, let's go.

642
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:31,591
You can't be decent to a man like that.
You have to treat him like an animal.

643
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,390
Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.

644
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,914
Insubordination
to a non-commissioned officer.

645
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:40,950
Yes, sir.

646
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,678
Only, it's a shame.

647
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:53,748
What is?

648
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,512
I was thinking,
too bad you'll lose a good middleweight.

649
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,829
I don't care.
I don't have to tolerate such insolence.

650
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:00,875
No, sir, you sure don't.

651
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,434
I'll prepare the papers then.

652
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,918
Trouble is,
even if he gets just three months...

653
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:12,150
...he'll still be in the stockade
for the boxing finals.

654
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:14,992
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

655
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:19,074
You could double up
on company punishment, sir.

656
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:21,627
All right. I'll throw the book at him.

657
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:24,513
If you think that's the way to do it.

658
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,231
Nice going, Sarge.

659
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:39,950
Keep looking, you'll find yourself
scrubbing this orderly room floor!

660
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:57,552
Coming through! Watch it.

661
00:47:57,639 --> 00:47:59,675
Me and my waiters
are working our tails off.

662
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:01,397
Hot! Hot! H-O-T!

663
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:06,273
How you doing, buddy boy?

664
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,635
Better than being thrown in the stockade,
ain't it?

665
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,587
How am I doing, Sarge? I'm a rough man.

666
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:15,874
Slow up a little, stop sweating in the food.

667
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,996
Don't hold me back, Sarge.
I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.

668
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,114
You'll never make it.

669
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:22,030
-Hi, Sarge.
-Hi, Top.

670
00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:35,875
Life in a rifle company.

671
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:40,475
You look awful tired, kid.

672
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,154
How do you like straight duty?

673
00:48:44,279 --> 00:48:45,678
What makes you think I mind it?

674
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,397
I didn't say you minded it.

675
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:51,028
I just said you looked tired.
You know, drawn to a fine edge.

676
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:53,434
I like this life. It's a great life.

677
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:55,635
If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in.

678
00:48:55,719 --> 00:48:57,437
Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?

679
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,795
If you didn't put me here,
I'd have no chance to find it, right?

680
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:03,268
Now, there's a man for you.
What do you know?

681
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,431
Since you like it so much,
I'll see if I can find more for you.

682
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:08,510
How about garbage detail?

683
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:10,191
Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.

684
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:13,077
So, you did. What about street cleaning?

685
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:15,074
Yesterday.

686
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:17,195
You got a better memory than me.

687
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:19,031
Of course, if you were smart....

688
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:21,107
Yeah, but I ain't smart.

689
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,316
I know. But if you were,
you wouldn't have to pull KP.

690
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:26,276
Or any other fatigue duty for that matter.

691
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:32,114
If you think you can bribe me into boxing,
Warden, you're wrong.

692
00:49:32,399 --> 00:49:35,391
Not you and Dynamite Holmes
and "The Treatment."

693
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,475
How long are you guys gonna keep
breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?

694
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:48,592
You've had him on that extra duty roster
a month already.

695
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:50,477
-I can't see why you--
-Can't you, Pete?

696
00:49:50,879 --> 00:49:53,951
Getting soft in your old age?
Maybe I want to teach him a lesson.

697
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:56,075
-Maybe you like it.
-Maybe I do.

698
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,510
I'm getting sick and tired
watching you being a stooge for Holmes.

699
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:03,994
You won't see it much longer.
I'm getting sick and tired of it myself.

700
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,877
I'm through, Pete.
Any day now. And I mean it.

701
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,117
Listen, if Holmes'd let me,
I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.

702
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,515
Half a dozen companies in this regiment
would grab me, in grade, too.

703
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,033
Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too.

704
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,587
Only I just can't think of leaving
my old buddies.

705
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,311
Where're you going, Little Sir Echo?

706
00:50:20,399 --> 00:50:23,675
To take my shower, if the stinking
First Sergeant has no objections.

707
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:25,829
Where'd you think?
To the movies in this towel?

708
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,238
Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

709
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:30,117
I wouldn't drink with you
if it was the last beer on Earth.

710
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:31,552
I'm buying.

711
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:33,951
That's different.

712
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:00,314
Do you know why I like
to have you serve me beer?

713
00:51:00,399 --> 00:51:03,152
So as I can watch you
when you walk away.

714
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,673
It's in regulations.
You got a right to complain.

715
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:11,512
You've a right to take your case
to the Inspector General.

716
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,352
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

717
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:17,351
Nope. I ain't gonna complain.

718
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:20,637
They ain't going to get that satisfaction.

719
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:26,757
This soldier's got a real big family.
Fifteen of them.

720
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:28,636
'Course this is only half of them.

721
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,550
You see the gentleman
with the handlebars?

722
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,472
That's Mr. Maggio.
Mr. Maggio is my father.

723
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,758
I never saw anyone so stubborn.

724
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:42,116
-How long since they let you go into town?
-Six weeks.

725
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,314
Liable to be six years.

726
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:45,708
How'd you like it?
Six years before you see a dame?

727
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:48,632
Look, why don't you just
mind your own business?

728
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,552
And why don't you learn to play the bugle?

729
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:26,913
That's my buddy boy!

730
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:42,911
Who's the broad?

731
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:44,712
It's my sister.

732
00:52:58,439 --> 00:52:59,428
You hit me!

733
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,272
Yeah, and I'm about to do it again, too.

734
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:05,797
Why, you dirty wop!

735
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,716
If you want to fight, take it outside!

736
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:09,278
I'll cut this wop's heart out.

737
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,351
Anybody steps in here,
I give it to him first.

738
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:16,991
One step further, Fatso,
and I'm going to de-brain you.

739
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,071
Nobody's doing nothing.
Anybody does any killing, I'll do it!

740
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,598
It's a private affair, Warden.

741
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:24,239
No, it isn't! This man's in my company!

742
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:28,557
And you ain't making two
extra weeks' paperwork for me for nothing.

743
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:29,873
Out for blood, huh?

744
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:31,836
You'd puke at the sight of a dead man.

745
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:34,353
Put down that stool. Put it down!

746
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,831
Drop that knife.

747
00:53:45,879 --> 00:53:49,667
Okay, Fatso,
if it's killing you want, come on.

748
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:53,277
Well, come on!

749
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:00,189
On the floor!

750
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:12,787
Killers, huh?

751
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:16,315
I'd trade the pair of you
for a good Camp Fire Girl!

752
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:25,757
Tough monkey.

753
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,676
Guys like you end up in the stockade
sooner or later.

754
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:32,752
Someday you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.

755
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:34,796
I'll show you a couple of things.

756
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:56,028
I'm going to get a breath of air.

757
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,590
I'm glad he stopped it.

758
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,191
He's a good man.

759
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:30,753
You keep it. Keep it for a souvenir.

760
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:34,114
Okay, I'll keep it.

761
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:37,149
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?

762
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:48,434
Could you stand a weekend pass?

763
00:55:48,919 --> 00:55:50,477
Could I....

764
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,634
What about Holmes?

765
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:55,238
Don't worry about Holmes.

766
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,549
He signs anything without reading it.

767
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,591
I sure could use it.

768
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:07,835
I hear you've gone dippy over some dame
down at the New Congress Club.

769
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,593
What'd you say her name was?

770
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:10,873
Lorene.

771
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:13,030
It's a beautiful name.

772
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:30,037
Hey, paisan!

773
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:32,350
What's holding you up? Let's get going.

774
00:56:32,439 --> 00:56:35,795
What's wrong? Don't you like it here?
Something better to do in town?

775
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:38,473
The bus is leaving right away.
I'm taking the bus.

776
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,471
Take off. You're talking to a rich man.
I'll hop a taxi.

777
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:43,550
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.

778
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:55,390
Maggio. Get ready for guard.

779
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:59,234
Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.
Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.

780
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:00,957
What? I got a pass!

781
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:03,713
Not anymore.
Anderson's sick. You're on guard.

782
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,790
I just had guard yesterday. Why me?

783
00:57:05,919 --> 00:57:09,309
I'll tell you why, you.
You should have gotten dressed faster.

784
00:57:16,759 --> 00:57:19,557
I sure never figured
on your giving me the runaround.

785
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,357
They didn't even want to let me in.

786
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,508
We're mobbed, that's why.

787
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:24,988
A big crowd from Hickam Field
got in here first.

788
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,388
-Did you expect a brass band to meet you?
-No.

789
00:57:27,479 --> 00:57:28,753
Thought you'd want to see me.

790
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:30,192
I'm busy, can't you see? Look.

791
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:31,473
Yes, I see it's crowded.

792
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:32,594
Well, I am.

793
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:37,592
Maggio's going to be
at the Kalakaua Inn later.

794
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,636
Is there no way you can get out of here?

795
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,038
What's the matter with you?

796
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:43,711
I work here, you know, after all.

797
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:45,027
Can't you understand?

798
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,828
Yes, I do. I understand.
I understand very well.

799
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,711
You haven't been here in weeks.
Now you turn up all of a sudden--

800
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:58,029
Watch it, Mack!
Watch where you're going!

801
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,871
Come on out of here.

802
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,752
Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?
I can't just walk out.

803
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,672
-Even if I could, she doesn't like us--
-All right, look.

804
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:17,353
If you feel that way,
just forget about it, okay?

805
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:19,270
You haven't any claims on me, mister.

806
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,917
You're not my husband, you know.

807
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:22,068
There you are.

808
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,071
I vastly admire your taste,
but we really need Lorene now.

809
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:26,911
So many gentlemen are unattended.

810
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:28,557
-It is such a rush, isn't it?
-Yeah.

811
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,109
Almost like one of those big
political conventions in Philadelphia.

812
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:33,518
You are coming, Lorene?

813
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,032
In a minute.

814
00:58:37,759 --> 00:58:38,748
I'm sorry.

815
00:58:39,479 --> 00:58:43,392
How do you think I feel?
I may not get another pass for months.

816
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,309
I've been counting on this
like a kid counts on Christmas.

817
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,113
But forget it.

818
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,554
Lorene's busy, she's got work to do.
Lorene's sorry.

819
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,550
Stop calling me Lorene! My name's Alma!

820
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:56,391
-Alma?
-Yes, Alma Burke!

821
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:57,714
Alma?

822
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:04,155
Mrs. Kipfer picked Lorene
out of a perfume ad.

823
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:07,509
She thought it sounded French.

824
00:59:24,919 --> 00:59:27,558
Hey, how did you get away?

825
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,716
I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.

826
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,558
-But I bet she doesn't believe it.
-I bet she doesn't.

827
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:35,233
-What'll you have?
-A Coke, please.

828
00:59:35,399 --> 00:59:37,435
Give her a big Coke.

829
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:39,317
It's great you meeting me here.

830
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:42,436
You know, I'm just lucky getting in town.

831
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:43,747
Top Kick gave me a break.

832
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,472
They still pouring it on?

833
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:48,357
Holmes and those others,
they really got me on the edge.

834
00:59:48,439 --> 00:59:51,715
-You must hate the Army.
-No, I don't hate the Army.

835
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:53,717
But look what it's doing to you.

836
00:59:54,439 --> 00:59:55,713
I love the Army.

837
00:59:57,239 --> 00:59:59,434
But it sure doesn't love you.

838
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:04,272
A man loves a thing,
that don't mean it's got to love him back.

839
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,829
Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.

840
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,597
You love a thing, you've got to be grateful.

841
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:13,557
I left home when I was 17.

842
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:15,237
Both my folks is dead.

843
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:18,755
I didn't belong no place
till I entered the Army.

844
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:20,950
That's where I learned to bugle.

845
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,668
To bugle?

846
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:27,196
That's the mouthpiece I used
when I played a taps at Arlington.

847
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:32,869
They picked me to play a taps
at Arlington Cemetery on Armistice Day.

848
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:35,035
The President was there.

849
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:39,790
I play the bugle well.

850
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,671
Hello, citizens!

851
01:00:43,279 --> 01:00:44,792
Hey, where you been?

852
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:48,594
Hi, pals. I've been in three bars
and I put a dent in all three of them.

853
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:50,038
Yeah, you look it.

854
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:51,990
Give me a nail. I'm hungry for a nail.

855
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,717
What you doing in uniform?

856
01:00:53,799 --> 01:00:56,188
I'm thinking of joining the Army.

857
01:00:56,839 --> 01:00:59,717
Or maybe I'll go to Mexico
and become a cowboy.

858
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:00,993
You want to go with me?

859
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,078
You keep on drinking,
you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

860
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:09,752
You're absolutely right.
Bartender! Large whisky.

861
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,030
Excuse me. Hey, buddy.

862
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:15,788
Sam!

863
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:20,833
Hey, coming out, fellas,
the terror of Gimbels' basement.

864
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:22,387
Stand back. Here we go.

865
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:24,117
A seven for Daddy, five deuce.

866
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:26,553
Seven.

867
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:28,951
Snake eyes.

868
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:30,718
The story of my life.

869
01:01:34,919 --> 01:01:38,150
Prew, that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
around the corner...

870
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:40,309
...where all those movie stars stay.

871
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,231
Paisan, you'd better simmer down.

872
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,469
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

873
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,311
That's what you say, buddy.

874
01:01:46,399 --> 01:01:48,913
What do you mean?
They only gave you an overnight pass?

875
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:49,988
No pass.

876
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:52,036
No pass. They put me on guard duty.

877
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:54,155
But old Angelo, he foxed them.

878
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:56,271
You walked off guard?

879
01:01:56,399 --> 01:01:58,833
I checked in and I checked right out again.

880
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:02,878
Get your tail right back to the post.
You're in trouble, you know that.

881
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:05,275
I got a good idea. Let's go swimming!

882
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,510
We'll go swimming with a movie star.
That's what I'm gonna do.

883
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,788
Listen, Angelo.

884
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:13,548
Twenty feet tall,
I'm going swimming with a movie star.

885
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:16,791
You'd better go.

886
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,718
Hey, Angelo.

887
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:33,588
You jerk, get up. Wake up.

888
01:02:33,759 --> 01:02:35,909
I'm awake. What are you hollering about?

889
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,990
Yeah, you're awake. Put your clothes on.

890
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,230
Give them back to the Indians.
They need the clothes.

891
01:02:41,439 --> 01:02:43,350
All they wear is G-strings.

892
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,233
You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.

893
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:53,068
I am waiting here for a movie star
to come out of the hotel.

894
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:55,753
I'm not going until she shows up.

895
01:02:56,279 --> 01:02:58,031
Put your clothes on.

896
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:01,957
Let's get out of here
before we get in trouble. Okay?

897
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:03,558
What's the matter with you?

898
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,476
Can't a man get drunk?

899
01:03:05,799 --> 01:03:07,710
Can't a man do nothing?

900
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:12,671
Can't he put his lousy hands
in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

901
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:16,273
A man gotta be hounded all his life?

902
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:18,835
I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

903
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:20,593
I ain't no coward!

904
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:22,317
Buddy boy, look....

905
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:26,713
Get dressed, put your clothes on.

906
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,998
-Wait for me? I'll get a cab.
-Yeah, sure.

907
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,354
-Will you wait?
-You get a cab.

908
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:50,356
Hey, MPs! Come and get me, you guys!

909
01:03:50,439 --> 01:03:51,952
Here I am!

910
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,557
Is that the best you can do?

911
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:00,789
I bet you guys eat Wheaties!

912
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,675
Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?

913
01:04:11,879 --> 01:04:13,392
It's on right now.

914
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:15,038
He'll get the stockade sure.

915
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:19,470
Maybe he won't get it.

916
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,512
All he did was to get drunk.

917
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:25,509
It's a soldier's nature.
It's almost a sacred duty once in a while.

918
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:27,397
But he walked off guard. He went AWOL.

919
01:04:27,479 --> 01:04:29,117
What are you hanging around here for?

920
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,348
Can't a man rest a minute?

921
01:04:30,439 --> 01:04:33,351
What man? You got no work?
Maybe I can scare you up some.

922
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,678
Go shoot some pool.
Any word comes, I'll let you know.

923
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,911
Company G,
First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.

924
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:59,030
Yes, sir, I'll have his things in order.

925
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,510
He got it. Six months.

926
01:05:15,399 --> 01:05:16,752
I'm gonna escape from this dump.

927
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:19,478
Gimbels' basement couldn't hold me,
neither can this.

928
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,789
-Shut up!
-Whatever you say, Brownie.

929
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:24,671
Prisoner! Halt!

930
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:43,471
Hello, tough monkey.

931
01:05:57,999 --> 01:06:02,754
This other girl and I were lucky to rent it.
This is a very fashionable district.

932
01:06:03,799 --> 01:06:05,710
I have another key made for you.

933
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:09,593
You can use it any time you want to,
even when I'm not here.

934
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:19,432
-Hi.
-Hi.

935
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,229
This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.

936
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:25,232
-This is Georgette, my roommate.
-Well, welcome, friend.

937
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,913
Hasn't been a man around the house
since the cat died.

938
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,711
I belong to the Book Guild Club.
I always take every book.

939
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:33,551
That's the way I get all the dividends.

940
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:38,750
She'll be great for your friend
when he gets out of the stockade.

941
01:06:38,839 --> 01:06:41,069
Yes, he'll be crazy about her.

942
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:46,393
Just sit down and get comfortable.

943
01:06:46,479 --> 01:06:50,108
I'll make you a martini
and see what's to cook for dinner.

944
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,154
This is like being married, ain't it?

945
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:54,638
It's better.

946
01:07:14,279 --> 01:07:15,598
You okay?

947
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:38,197
Glad you came?

948
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:09,512
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

949
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,873
It can't go on like this much longer.

950
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,875
Even though we sneaked across
the island...

951
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,554
...we had to run out like jailbirds.

952
01:08:58,599 --> 01:09:00,874
If there was only some way we....

953
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:06,954
Holmes'd probably give you a divorce,
but never let me transfer out of his outfit.

954
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:09,632
There is a way.

955
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:13,036
I've been thinking about it.

956
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:14,752
You've got to become an officer.

957
01:09:15,559 --> 01:09:18,869
You can take the new extension course,
the one they passed last May.

958
01:09:18,959 --> 01:09:22,235
-Once commissioned you go to the States.
-An officer?

959
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:26,229
Yes. Then I could divorce Dana
and marry you.

960
01:09:26,599 --> 01:09:29,318
I hate officers. I've always hated officers!

961
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,557
Well, that's a fine, intelligent point of view.

962
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:36,552
Suppose I said I always hated sergeants.
That'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

963
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,157
You sure made a complete study of it.

964
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,115
Okay, suppose I did it.
And don't think it's a cinch.

965
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:48,550
You'd be here, I'd be in the States,
we'd be apart six months!

966
01:09:48,639 --> 01:09:51,312
-We're sure to be into a war--
-Tell the truth.

967
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:55,278
You don't want the responsibility.
You're probably not even in love with me.

968
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,668
You're crazy! I wish I didn't love you.

969
01:09:57,759 --> 01:09:59,272
Maybe I could enjoy life again.

970
01:10:06,599 --> 01:10:09,955
So they were married
and lived unhappily ever after.

971
01:10:11,559 --> 01:10:15,598
I've never been so miserable in my life
as I have since I met you.

972
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:17,432
Neither have I.

973
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:20,916
-I wouldn't trade a minute of it.
-Neither would I.

974
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:27,790
I'll probably make the lousiest officer
in this man's Army you ever saw.

975
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:30,349
You'll make a fine officer.

976
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:32,990
A remarkable officer.

977
01:10:38,519 --> 01:10:39,872
Thank you.

978
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:43,717
Come here.

979
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,753
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

980
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:53,513
Honey...

981
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:56,438
...I want to marry you.

982
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,072
You're a funny one.

983
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:03,032
Why's it funny if a guy
wants to marry you?

984
01:11:04,639 --> 01:11:07,312
Because I'm a girl you met
at the New Congress Club.

985
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:09,674
That's about two steps
up from the pavement.

986
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:13,308
Well, what am I?
I'm a private, no-class dogface.

987
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:17,678
The way most civilians look at that,
that's two steps up from nothing.

988
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:21,349
Prew, I thought we were happy.

989
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:23,311
Why do you want to spoil things?

990
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:26,516
Look, I've got a year to go
before I re-enlist.

991
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:31,158
If I can swing sergeant's stripes by then,
they'll let me go back to the States.

992
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:32,433
We can go back together...

993
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:34,112
...if you'll wait.

994
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:37,191
How do you expect to become a sergeant
under Captain Holmes?

995
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:39,554
It's all you can do
to keep out of the stockade.

996
01:11:42,919 --> 01:11:44,272
I'll fight.

997
01:11:44,599 --> 01:11:45,668
You're not gonna fight.

998
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,033
It'd be worth it.

999
01:11:51,919 --> 01:11:54,797
Prew, it's true we love each other now.

1000
01:11:55,999 --> 01:11:57,671
We need each other.

1001
01:11:58,879 --> 01:12:01,552
But back in the States
it might be different.

1002
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:04,475
That ain't the real reason.

1003
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:10,391
-All right, it's not.
-What is the real reason?

1004
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:16,797
I won't marry you because
I don't want to be the wife of a soldier.

1005
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:25,070
Well, that would be about the best
I could ever do for you.

1006
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:32,153
Because nobody's going to stop me
from my plan. Nobody, nothing.

1007
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:34,111
Because I want to be proper.

1008
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:35,428
"Proper"?

1009
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,078
Yes, proper.

1010
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,958
In another year,
I'll have enough money saved.

1011
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:42,910
I'll go back to my hometown in Oregon.

1012
01:12:42,999 --> 01:12:45,513
I'll build a house for my mother and myself.

1013
01:12:45,599 --> 01:12:48,159
Join the country club and take up golf.

1014
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:52,754
I'll meet the proper man
with the proper position.

1015
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:55,469
I'll make a proper wife
who can run a proper home.

1016
01:12:55,559 --> 01:12:57,436
Raise proper children.

1017
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:02,035
I'll be happy because when you're proper,
you're safe.

1018
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,951
You got guts, honey.

1019
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,149
I hope you can pull it off.

1020
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:20,798
I do mean it when I say I need you,
'cause I'm lonely.

1021
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:24,797
You think I'm lying, don't you?

1022
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:28,593
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

1023
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:39,430
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

1024
01:13:39,519 --> 01:13:43,671
Why? Because the scandal
would spoil your chances for a promotion?

1025
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:47,075
I ask you once more: I want to know
who he is and where you met him.

1026
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:48,797
I'm not going to tell you.

1027
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,598
One thing I know: I know he's a civilian.

1028
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,954
You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.

1029
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:58,077
I wonder which is hurt more,
your pride or your curiosity?

1030
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,150
You can't know how I feel about this.

1031
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:03,357
I wonder why men feel so differently
about it than women?

1032
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:05,830
It's just not the same.

1033
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:13,431
It's a lovely day. I think I'll go for a walk.

1034
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:22,752
I hear you just got out of the stockade.

1035
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:26,357
It was rugged.
Kept my mouth shut, didn't get in trouble.

1036
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,237
Did you see Maggio?

1037
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,107
Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.
He's using a billy, too.

1038
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:36,194
In places where it won't show.
On the back, on the chest.

1039
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:38,157
He's got it down to a system.

1040
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,195
He kicks him a lot, too.

1041
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:42,950
You know how Maggio's taking it?

1042
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,078
He just keeps spitting in Fatso's eye.

1043
01:14:46,799 --> 01:14:48,517
Ain't he a hot one?

1044
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,750
Well, he's a good man.

1045
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:55,434
Fatso can't make a dent in him.

1046
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:59,952
But, that Fatso, he's smart. He makes sure
the O.D. never sees nothing.

1047
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,876
Why don't Maggio go to the O.D. himself?

1048
01:15:01,959 --> 01:15:04,109
We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.

1049
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,235
That boy's the toughest nut in the woods.

1050
01:15:06,679 --> 01:15:09,318
You think he's going to be all right?

1051
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:10,912
Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.

1052
01:15:10,999 --> 01:15:11,988
What do you mean?

1053
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:15,590
After Fatso threw him in the Hole--
That's solitary...

1054
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:19,189
...he started talking a couple of times
about how he's gonna escape.

1055
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:21,793
He said to tell you
he'll look you up one night.

1056
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:26,150
Still on your knees, Prewitt?

1057
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:29,870
Boxing finals next month: December 15.

1058
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:33,395
You've still got time to help us
win the championship.

1059
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,075
Are you proud to be in this company
or not?

1060
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:47,395
I ain't gonna move around you again.

1061
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:50,199
Something tells me you need a lesson.

1062
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:52,150
Maybe I'll give it to you myself.

1063
01:15:56,519 --> 01:15:58,510
Leave him alone. He's in my detail.

1064
01:15:58,599 --> 01:16:01,477
You'll get in trouble if you fight here.
Get back to work.

1065
01:16:01,559 --> 01:16:03,277
Get out of my way!

1066
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:34,190
I'll be glad to recommend you.

1067
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:36,475
You've got service, experience, grade.

1068
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,073
-You'll make an excellent officer.
-Thank you, sir.

1069
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:42,674
It'd be a feather in my cap, too.
A man from my company.

1070
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:46,236
At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?

1071
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:49,311
They're fighting outside, sir.
Galovitch and Prewitt.

1072
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:50,354
Prewitt?

1073
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,953
Galovitch looks like
he's going to murder him.

1074
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:54,836
I'll take care of it.

1075
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,232
Don't you want to see?

1076
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:02,958
No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!

1077
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:12,112
Why don't Prew go for his head?

1078
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:14,633
Blinded a guy once.
Must be scared of the same thing.

1079
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:24,477
The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!

1080
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:44,712
Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!

1081
01:17:44,839 --> 01:17:46,192
I'll fight any way I want.

1082
01:17:47,919 --> 01:17:49,750
Come on, Prew, get up!

1083
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:23,348
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

1084
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:26,067
-What's his name, Major?
-Captain Holmes, sir.

1085
01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:55,915
At ease. What started this?

1086
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:00,038
Prewitt refused an order I gave him.
Talked back and started a fight.

1087
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,274
I taught him a lesson.

1088
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:04,276
You won't disobey orders in my company.

1089
01:19:04,359 --> 01:19:06,953
Sir, I'm sorry,
but Private Prewitt's not to blame.

1090
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,030
Sergeant Galovitch started it.

1091
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,472
-Thornhill?
-Yes, sir.

1092
01:19:10,559 --> 01:19:12,834
You're in charge of this detail.
What about it?

1093
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:14,438
He's right, Prewitt did nothing.

1094
01:19:14,519 --> 01:19:16,828
Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.

1095
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:19,475
That's all. Let's forget it.

1096
01:19:19,599 --> 01:19:21,669
Let's get back to our jobs.

1097
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:31,276
If you guys think this means
I'll step into a ring, you're wrong.

1098
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,993
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

1099
01:20:15,639 --> 01:20:17,038
Hey, Friday.

1100
01:20:17,559 --> 01:20:19,038
Why are you called "Friday"?

1101
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:21,917
I don't know. I was born on a Wednesday.

1102
01:21:28,839 --> 01:21:30,750
Hey, Prewitt, where you going?

1103
01:21:30,959 --> 01:21:32,028
Where am I going?

1104
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:35,475
I'm going to Choy's.
I'm gonna get me another beer.

1105
01:21:48,999 --> 01:21:50,068
Halt!

1106
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:53,717
Who goes there?

1107
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:55,348
A friend.

1108
01:21:55,559 --> 01:21:57,789
Advance, friend, and be recognized!

1109
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:08,752
Ten-hut!

1110
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:10,798
About face!

1111
01:22:10,879 --> 01:22:12,153
Rear face!

1112
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,354
On your knees!

1113
01:22:13,519 --> 01:22:15,157
Scrub the floor!

1114
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,038
At ease.

1115
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:20,668
Hello, kid.

1116
01:22:20,759 --> 01:22:23,512
What you doing out here all by yourself?

1117
01:22:25,519 --> 01:22:27,237
I'm gonna get a little drink.

1118
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:29,310
Sit down. I got a bottle.

1119
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:37,758
Thanks, Top.

1120
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,278
I got to hand it to you, kid...

1121
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:43,476
...the way you beat up
old Galovitch this afternoon.

1122
01:22:43,599 --> 01:22:46,432
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

1123
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:56,553
Life's crummy, you know it?

1124
01:22:56,959 --> 01:22:59,917
Yes, sir, it's perfectly miserable.

1125
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:06,156
What do you suppose would happen
if a truck came along and ran us over?

1126
01:23:06,879 --> 01:23:08,597
We'd be dead.

1127
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:10,393
Better not sit here anymore.

1128
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:13,630
You'd better get up
and sit over on the side of the road.

1129
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:15,516
What do you mean, I better?

1130
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:17,749
You've got more to live for than I do.

1131
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:19,909
You got your whole company
to take care of.

1132
01:23:19,999 --> 01:23:22,433
You move over
to the other side of the road.

1133
01:23:22,519 --> 01:23:24,828
I'm old and it don't matter if I die.

1134
01:23:24,919 --> 01:23:27,672
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Don't argue. Get up.

1135
01:23:27,759 --> 01:23:29,033
No, sir, not Prewitt.

1136
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:31,997
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

1137
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,233
Okay, we'll stay together.

1138
01:23:40,879 --> 01:23:43,916
I couldn't have got up anyway.

1139
01:23:47,879 --> 01:23:50,916
I got the biggest troubles
in the whole world.

1140
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,115
In the whole world, huh?

1141
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:55,672
Take love.

1142
01:23:56,359 --> 01:23:59,396
Did you personally ever see
any of this love?

1143
01:24:00,039 --> 01:24:02,189
You'll understand what I mean.

1144
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:04,031
This girl...

1145
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:06,989
...she wants me to become....

1146
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:09,556
-Become what?
-An officer.

1147
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:12,194
Can you see me as an officer?

1148
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:15,833
Yeah, I can see you as an officer.

1149
01:24:15,959 --> 01:24:17,153
You'd be a good officer.

1150
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:20,037
Well, you both can see
more than I can see.

1151
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,390
I don't wanna be an officer.
I'm happy where I am.

1152
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:27,947
I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

1153
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:32,392
You wouldn't want me
to be a guy like Holmes, would you?

1154
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:34,871
Well, would you?

1155
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,469
A man should be what he can do.

1156
01:24:49,519 --> 01:24:51,237
How's your girl?

1157
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:53,996
What's her name again?

1158
01:24:56,119 --> 01:24:57,029
Lorene.

1159
01:24:57,119 --> 01:24:58,313
Oh, yeah.

1160
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:00,917
I remember now.

1161
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,351
A beautiful name.

1162
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,513
Beautiful.

1163
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:13,315
You two dumb, crazy screwballs.

1164
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:15,674
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

1165
01:25:15,759 --> 01:25:17,431
Why are you in the middle of the road?

1166
01:25:17,519 --> 01:25:20,636
My friend Prew and I,
we're sitting here discussing the weather.

1167
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:22,835
-Your friend, huh?
-You heard me.

1168
01:25:22,919 --> 01:25:25,274
Don't you know
you gotta take care of this man?

1169
01:25:25,519 --> 01:25:28,352
Holmes is bound to get him
sooner or later.

1170
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,279
And he's the best stinking soldier
in the whole Army.

1171
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:33,748
You both got rocks in your head.

1172
01:25:37,919 --> 01:25:39,432
Angelo.

1173
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:45,593
I figured you'd be here at Choy's.

1174
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:48,867
I done it, Prew.

1175
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:51,195
I escaped just like I said.

1176
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,270
Just like I figured...

1177
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:55,873
...in a back of a truck, under a tarp.

1178
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:57,917
They rode me right out.

1179
01:25:57,999 --> 01:25:59,717
Just like I figured.

1180
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,676
Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,
about a mile back...

1181
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:05,909
...and I fell out in the road.

1182
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,835
You should've seen me bounce.

1183
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:10,955
I must've broke something.

1184
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:18,238
Prew, listen.

1185
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:21,035
Fatso done it, Prew.

1186
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,155
He likes to whack me in the gut.

1187
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:25,435
He asks me if it hurts...

1188
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:27,749
...and I spit at him like always.

1189
01:26:28,279 --> 01:26:31,237
Only yesterday, it was bad.

1190
01:26:31,639 --> 01:26:33,038
He hit me...

1191
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:34,678
...he hit me...

1192
01:26:34,759 --> 01:26:36,112
...he hit me.

1193
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:40,311
I had to get out, Prew.

1194
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:45,630
-They gonna send you to the stockade?
-No, they ain't.

1195
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:47,118
Watch out for Fatso.

1196
01:26:49,959 --> 01:26:51,551
He'll try to crack you.

1197
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,789
If they put you in the Hole...

1198
01:26:53,999 --> 01:26:55,432
...don't yell.

1199
01:26:55,639 --> 01:26:57,436
Don't make a sound.

1200
01:26:57,999 --> 01:27:01,548
You'll still be yelling
when they come to take you out.

1201
01:27:01,919 --> 01:27:03,511
Just lay there.

1202
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:08,112
Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.

1203
01:27:21,799 --> 01:27:23,118
He's dead.

1204
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,675
I'll bet you that's Prew.

1205
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:12,911
Sergeant Judson?

1206
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:15,198
You want me?

1207
01:30:15,879 --> 01:30:17,278
Yeah, Fatso.

1208
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:21,998
I don't like that nickname.
You want to see me about something?

1209
01:30:22,839 --> 01:30:25,876
Let's step around the corner
where we can talk.

1210
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:27,628
Okay.

1211
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:40,031
Are you sore about something?

1212
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,392
I don't like the way you play the piano.

1213
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:46,518
Remember Maggio?

1214
01:30:46,799 --> 01:30:49,233
The wop? Yeah, real tough monkey.

1215
01:30:49,639 --> 01:30:51,550
-You killed him.
-Did I?

1216
01:30:52,199 --> 01:30:53,837
Well, if I did, he asked for it.

1217
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:57,596
The Army's going to get you
sooner or later, Fatso.

1218
01:30:57,839 --> 01:31:00,990
But before they do,
I want a piece of you myself.

1219
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:03,912
I figured that.

1220
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:06,158
See this knife?

1221
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,673
It's the one you pulled on Maggio.

1222
01:32:40,879 --> 01:32:43,109
What's happened?

1223
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:49,788
It's all right.

1224
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:53,992
Don't worry.

1225
01:32:54,439 --> 01:32:55,918
I ain't gonna die.

1226
01:33:12,919 --> 01:33:14,716
First Platoon present and accounted for!

1227
01:33:14,799 --> 01:33:16,278
Second Platoon all accounted for!

1228
01:33:16,359 --> 01:33:18,395
Third Platoon all present
and accounted for!

1229
01:33:18,679 --> 01:33:20,795
Fourth Platoon all present
and accounted for!

1230
01:33:20,879 --> 01:33:22,392
Fifth Platoon all accounted for!

1231
01:33:22,879 --> 01:33:24,471
Sixth Platoon all accounted for!

1232
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:27,593
Company, dismissed!

1233
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:34,117
Prewitt's still absent.

1234
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:36,997
Makes three days now.

1235
01:33:39,639 --> 01:33:42,631
How long are you gonna carry him present,
Top?

1236
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:44,358
I just mention it.

1237
01:33:44,439 --> 01:33:46,350
Well, don't mention it.

1238
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,472
"Upon observing these incidents,
an investigation was made...

1239
01:33:55,559 --> 01:33:59,347
"...by the Inspector General's Department
over a period of several months.

1240
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:01,231
"It was found that Captain Holmes...

1241
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:05,028
"...has been guilty of indefensible cruelty
to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

1242
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:08,873
"As mentioned, this included instigation
of wholly unauthorized tactics...

1243
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:13,032
"...to force the soldier
to join the interregiment boxing team."

1244
01:34:17,919 --> 01:34:19,716
I'm waiting for your reply.

1245
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:21,553
I haven't any, sir.

1246
01:34:23,719 --> 01:34:27,871
First thing I learned in the Army
was that an officer takes care of his men.

1247
01:34:27,959 --> 01:34:30,519
It seems to be the first thing you forgot.

1248
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:31,873
My only regret is...

1249
01:34:31,959 --> 01:34:35,235
...we have to keep you in uniform
till a court-martial is concluded.

1250
01:34:35,959 --> 01:34:38,632
If there were any way
to avoid a court-martial, sir.

1251
01:34:39,839 --> 01:34:43,354
There is one alternative, General,
if you are so disposed:

1252
01:34:43,599 --> 01:34:47,512
A resignation for the good of the service
under Army regulations.

1253
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:50,317
Write a letter of resignation.

1254
01:34:50,439 --> 01:34:52,475
Have it on my desk this afternoon.

1255
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:54,191
As far as I'm concerned...

1256
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,158
...the quicker you're out,
the better for everybody...

1257
01:34:57,279 --> 01:34:59,349
...especially the Army.

1258
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,357
That's all, Holmes.

1259
01:35:09,559 --> 01:35:11,834
I know what's been going on in this outfit.

1260
01:35:11,919 --> 01:35:14,228
I know how far some of you
have been out of line.

1261
01:35:14,559 --> 01:35:17,392
If you want to remain non-coms,
you'd better snap into it.

1262
01:35:17,559 --> 01:35:18,753
And another thing:

1263
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:22,429
From now on,
no man will earn his stripes by boxing.

1264
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,789
-Get rid of those.
-Yes, sir.

1265
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:28,752
Dismissed.

1266
01:35:34,519 --> 01:35:36,714
-About Sergeant Galovitch.
-Yes, sir.

1267
01:35:36,799 --> 01:35:39,518
Bust him. Sergeant Galovitch
is now Private Galovitch.

1268
01:35:39,599 --> 01:35:41,988
Put him in charge of the latrine.

1269
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,387
What are you grinning at?

1270
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:46,994
I think the Company Commander
made a wise decision, sir.

1271
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:50,835
Company G, Captain Ross.

1272
01:35:52,559 --> 01:35:53,833
Just a minute.

1273
01:35:53,919 --> 01:35:56,752
-It's for you, Sergeant.
-Thank you, sir.

1274
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:00,433
Yes, sir.

1275
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:05,998
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

1276
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:08,428
What?

1277
01:36:08,599 --> 01:36:10,874
I've got to see you, Milt. It's important.

1278
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:15,791
Okay, I'll get away somehow.

1279
01:36:15,919 --> 01:36:18,877
Sure, that'd be fine, yeah.

1280
01:36:19,239 --> 01:36:21,912
I'll be there in about an hour. Right.

1281
01:36:25,599 --> 01:36:29,638
He's being sent back to the States,
sailing next week, and wants me to go.

1282
01:36:29,719 --> 01:36:30,754
What will we do?

1283
01:36:32,799 --> 01:36:35,757
When do you think
you'll get your commission?

1284
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:42,313
I didn't put it in.
I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.

1285
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:46,632
I took it out of my desk a dozen times,
but I couldn't sign it.

1286
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:48,028
Why?

1287
01:36:49,559 --> 01:36:51,993
-But it was the plan--
-I know.

1288
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,558
It's been weeks.

1289
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:55,834
You can't say you'll do a thing
and not do it.

1290
01:36:55,919 --> 01:36:57,147
Karen, listen to me.

1291
01:36:57,239 --> 01:37:00,515
Why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you tell me?

1292
01:37:01,599 --> 01:37:03,351
Be back in a minute.

1293
01:37:05,879 --> 01:37:08,632
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

1294
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:17,834
I thought it was a guy from our company,
Prewitt, the kid I told you about.

1295
01:37:17,919 --> 01:37:20,638
He got mixed up with a girl
at the New Congress Club.

1296
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,552
He's AWOL, probably in lots of trouble.

1297
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:26,712
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no-good....

1298
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:32,791
Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.

1299
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,268
I can't be anything else.

1300
01:37:34,359 --> 01:37:36,748
If I try to be an officer,
I'll be putting on an act.

1301
01:37:36,839 --> 01:37:40,309
I just can't do it. Please don't ask me why.

1302
01:37:41,959 --> 01:37:43,312
I know why.

1303
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:46,429
You don't have to become an officer now...

1304
01:37:46,519 --> 01:37:48,953
...now that Dana's out of the Army.

1305
01:37:49,159 --> 01:37:51,434
You just don't want to marry me.

1306
01:37:51,519 --> 01:37:53,987
You're already married to the Army.

1307
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,831
I love you, Karen.

1308
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:02,671
I know.

1309
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:06,798
I don't want you to go back to Holmes.

1310
01:38:06,959 --> 01:38:09,427
I don't want to, either. But I am.

1311
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:11,948
There's nothing else for me to do.

1312
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,117
It's no good with us, Milt.
It could never have been any good.

1313
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,837
Hiding, sneaking.

1314
01:38:17,239 --> 01:38:18,957
It had to wear out.

1315
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:24,037
Good-bye, Sergeant.

1316
01:38:24,759 --> 01:38:27,193
-Thanks.
-It ain't good-bye, it's....

1317
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:30,838
We'll see each other again, somewhere.

1318
01:38:31,879 --> 01:38:34,757
Of course we will. Somewhere.

1319
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:49,988
Here it is.

1320
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:52,468
Got it on the inside page already.

1321
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:54,434
"Still no clue...

1322
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,790
"...in the fatal stabbing
of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson."

1323
01:38:58,799 --> 01:39:00,391
Did you hear me?

1324
01:39:03,519 --> 01:39:05,794
Are you trying to set a new world's record?

1325
01:39:07,759 --> 01:39:09,954
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

1326
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,508
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt...

1327
01:39:13,959 --> 01:39:16,951
...holder of the new world's record.

1328
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:36,667
-Everything all right, Top?
-Great.

1329
01:39:36,839 --> 01:39:40,229
This is a beautiful meal to put in front
of a guy on a Sunday morning.

1330
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:41,911
Congratulations.

1331
01:39:55,639 --> 01:39:57,675
They sure look pretty
over them mountains.

1332
01:39:57,759 --> 01:39:59,078
Don't they, though?

1333
01:40:07,879 --> 01:40:10,347
Sounds like they're dynamiting
down at Wheeler Field.

1334
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:14,227
Mighty ambitious.
Sunday morning before 8:00?

1335
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:29,515
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!

1336
01:40:29,599 --> 01:40:31,874
I've seen the red circles on the--

1337
01:41:01,799 --> 01:41:03,869
Get out of here. Hurry up! Go!

1338
01:41:07,919 --> 01:41:09,989
This is a real attack, not a maneuver.

1339
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:12,309
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.

1340
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:14,754
Please keep in your homes.
Do not go on the streets.

1341
01:41:14,839 --> 01:41:16,113
This is a real attack.

1342
01:41:16,199 --> 01:41:19,589
Japanese planes are bombing
our Naval and Army installations.

1343
01:41:23,519 --> 01:41:24,872
-Quiet down!
-At ease!

1344
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:28,947
Non-coms, get BARs and ammunition
from the supply room. Get up on the roof.

1345
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:30,028
Anderson!

1346
01:41:30,519 --> 01:41:33,238
You're in charge of the loading detail.
Get moving.

1347
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:35,198
Rest of you men, listen to me.

1348
01:41:35,319 --> 01:41:38,789
Every man get his rifle, go to his bunk
and stay there. And I mean...

1349
01:41:38,879 --> 01:41:40,710
...stay there!

1350
01:41:41,479 --> 01:41:45,358
Shut up! You'll get your ears shot off
if you go outside.

1351
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:49,193
You'll get plenty of chances to be heroes
with Japs in your lap before night.

1352
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:51,827
Now get moving, we're wasting time!

1353
01:41:55,639 --> 01:41:59,518
Into the kitchen and make a pot of coffee.
Wait a minute, a barrel of coffee!

1354
01:42:19,159 --> 01:42:21,753
I can't issue live ammunition
without a signed order.

1355
01:42:21,839 --> 01:42:24,592
-The Captain ain't here, jerk!
-Sorry. No order, no ammo.

1356
01:42:24,679 --> 01:42:26,476
-What's the matter?
-I got my orders!

1357
01:42:26,559 --> 01:42:29,027
Army regulations state that I can't--

1358
01:42:33,479 --> 01:42:34,958
You blind? Give me the key!

1359
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:37,553
-I got to obey orders, Top.
-I'll see you get a medal!

1360
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:40,073
-Bust it down, boys!
-I warned you!

1361
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:04,310
Don't go out, Warden, you'll get killed!

1362
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:06,913
Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!

1363
01:43:32,759 --> 01:43:34,431
Give them a hand with this ammo!

1364
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:35,833
Put that stuff over there.

1365
01:43:41,759 --> 01:43:44,193
Watch your fire, boys,
and lead those planes!

1366
01:44:03,999 --> 01:44:06,388
Friday's gone crazy!
He's blowing the Cavalry Charge!

1367
01:44:09,919 --> 01:44:11,113
Here they come, boys!

1368
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:43,471
I got him, Pete! I got him!

1369
01:44:43,919 --> 01:44:45,511
I got him!

1370
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:55,788
The danger of an invasion
continues to exist.

1371
01:44:55,879 --> 01:44:58,951
Infantry from Schofield Barracks
moved out within a few hours...

1372
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:00,836
...and have manned beach positions.

1373
01:45:00,919 --> 01:45:02,352
This is no maneuver.

1374
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:04,390
This is the real McCoy.

1375
01:45:04,679 --> 01:45:06,271
Look out for falling shrapnel.

1376
01:45:06,559 --> 01:45:07,912
Keep under cover.

1377
01:45:07,999 --> 01:45:11,594
Blackout and curfew restrictions
will be rigidly enforced.

1378
01:45:11,799 --> 01:45:14,677
Stay in your homes.
Don't use the telephone.

1379
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:19,268
Rest assured that immediate relay
to you of any and all information....

1380
01:45:19,399 --> 01:45:21,390
We've been to Queen's Hospital
giving blood.

1381
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:22,514
The town's a madhouse!

1382
01:45:22,599 --> 01:45:24,351
A big house was bombed on Kuhio Street.

1383
01:45:24,439 --> 01:45:27,158
The drugstore down on McNully
and King is smashed flat!

1384
01:45:27,359 --> 01:45:28,758
A man and his wife were killed.

1385
01:45:28,959 --> 01:45:32,952
Your attention, please.
Listen to this carefully and keep calm.

1386
01:45:33,159 --> 01:45:36,117
The danger of an invasion
continues to exist.

1387
01:45:36,199 --> 01:45:39,794
And the planes have been identified
as Japanese planes.

1388
01:45:40,759 --> 01:45:42,795
Who do they think they're fighting?

1389
01:45:42,959 --> 01:45:46,474
They're picking trouble
with the best Army in the world.

1390
01:45:47,879 --> 01:45:48,994
Where you going?

1391
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,833
I gotta get back to the company.

1392
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:55,553
The company? But why?

1393
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:57,108
Why?

1394
01:45:57,519 --> 01:45:59,987
But you can't. You're not well yet.

1395
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:02,873
You're AWOL.
They'll throw you in the stockade.

1396
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:06,590
They'll be throwing them out
of the stockade. They need everyone.

1397
01:46:06,679 --> 01:46:08,237
But your side'll open up.

1398
01:46:08,839 --> 01:46:11,194
They'll find out you killed that soldier.

1399
01:46:11,479 --> 01:46:14,437
Once I report in to the company,
they'll take care of me.

1400
01:46:14,519 --> 01:46:16,077
I'll be all right once I get back.

1401
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,435
But you'll never make it!
There's patrols all over!

1402
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:22,113
I'll make it. I know a shortcut.

1403
01:46:24,919 --> 01:46:26,750
Prew, stay till morning.

1404
01:46:26,839 --> 01:46:29,433
Maybe if you stay till morning
you'll change your mind.

1405
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:38,516
Prew, don't go!

1406
01:46:38,999 --> 01:46:40,557
I'll do anything you want.

1407
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:45,148
We can go back to the States together,
we can even get married.

1408
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:51,391
If you go now,
I'll never see you again, I know it.

1409
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:53,194
I'm sorry.

1410
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:00,594
What do you want to go back
to the Army for?

1411
01:47:00,679 --> 01:47:03,477
What did the Army do for you
besides treat you like dirt...

1412
01:47:03,559 --> 01:47:05,356
...and give you one awful going over?

1413
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:09,432
Get your friend killed!
What do you want to go back for?

1414
01:47:09,559 --> 01:47:12,027
What do I want to go back for?
I'm a soldier.

1415
01:47:12,559 --> 01:47:16,029
A soldier! A regular.
From the regular Army!

1416
01:47:16,119 --> 01:47:17,677
A 30-year man!

1417
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:23,227
I got to turn off the lights,
'cause of the blackout outside.

1418
01:47:36,559 --> 01:47:39,153
They say they've seen parachutists
land up in the hills.

1419
01:47:39,239 --> 01:47:40,513
I ain't worried about them.

1420
01:47:40,599 --> 01:47:42,430
Saboteurs is what worries me.

1421
01:47:42,519 --> 01:47:45,556
I bet they're operating
all over these islands.

1422
01:48:55,719 --> 01:48:56,708
Halt!

1423
01:48:59,479 --> 01:49:00,468
Halt!

1424
01:49:11,999 --> 01:49:12,988
Halt!

1425
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:50,349
Do you know this man, Sergeant?

1426
01:49:50,519 --> 01:49:51,793
Yes, sir.

1427
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:54,275
He didn't have any regular identification.

1428
01:49:54,359 --> 01:49:56,714
They found a card on him with his name.

1429
01:49:56,959 --> 01:49:58,790
Seems to be membership of a club:

1430
01:49:58,919 --> 01:50:00,750
The New Congress Club.

1431
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,997
You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.

1432
01:50:06,999 --> 01:50:08,478
Was this man a friend of yours?

1433
01:50:08,599 --> 01:50:12,512
Yes, sir. He must've been trying to reach
our company position up the beach here.

1434
01:50:12,599 --> 01:50:14,237
Then why didn't he halt?

1435
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:17,356
He was always a hardhead, sir,
but he was a good soldier.

1436
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:19,868
He loved the Army
more than any soldier I ever knew.

1437
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:23,233
I see. I'm sorry, Sergeant.

1438
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:40,794
You just couldn't play it smart, could you?

1439
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,114
All you had to do was box, but no,
not you, you hardhead.

1440
01:50:45,799 --> 01:50:50,111
Funny thing is, there ain't gonna be
any boxing championships this year.

1441
01:50:56,759 --> 01:50:59,068
What's the matter?
Ain't you ever seen a dead man?

1442
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:02,196
Let's get this body out of here!
We ain't got all night!

1443
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:25,190
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

1444
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:33,148
I think it's the most beautiful place
I ever saw in my life.

1445
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:37,437
I can almost see where I worked from here.

1446
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:42,797
There's a legend:

1447
01:51:43,999 --> 01:51:47,514
If they float in toward shore,
you'll come back some day.

1448
01:51:48,439 --> 01:51:49,997
If they float out to sea, you won't.

1449
01:51:55,639 --> 01:51:57,630
I won't come back.

1450
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:01,758
My fianc was killed on December 7.

1451
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,552
I'm sorry.

1452
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:07,230
He was a bomber pilot.

1453
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:10,272
He tried to taxi his plane
to the edge of the apron.

1454
01:52:10,399 --> 01:52:12,708
The Japs made a direct hit on it.

1455
01:52:13,519 --> 01:52:16,158
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

1456
01:52:16,599 --> 01:52:18,749
He was awarded the Silver Star.

1457
01:52:19,799 --> 01:52:21,994
They sent it to his mother.

1458
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:24,155
She wrote me she wanted me to have it.

1459
01:52:24,799 --> 01:52:26,755
That's very fine of her.

1460
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,477
They're very fine people. Southern people.

1461
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:33,554
He was named after a general.

1462
01:52:34,359 --> 01:52:35,917
Robert E. Lee...

1463
01:52:36,759 --> 01:52:37,748
...Prewitt.

1464
01:52:39,839 --> 01:52:40,828
Who?

1465
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:45,755
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

1466
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:50,031
Isn't that a silly old name?
