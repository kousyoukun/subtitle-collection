3
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,923
I'm gonna be
the best surfer in the world.

4
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm gonna be
the best surfer in the world, not you.

5
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,866
She's just sliding in there.
Look at that wave.

6
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,827
Anne Marie Chadwick
getting the best wave of the day.

7
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,509
Anne Marie, I’m leaving you!

8
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,433
Hey, how's it, wave riders?
It’s hump day. Wednesday, February 3rd.

9
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,353
Waves are averaging 14 feet in 18 seconds,

10
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,357
so there's definitely some size out there
in the water, and it's moving our way.

11
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,317
There's a little bit of morning sickness
out right now,

12
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,320
but it should clean up as the winds pick up.

13
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,512
It's flat.

14
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,222
Yeah, right.
I’m looking at it.

15
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,933
-Anne Marie?
-What's up, JJ?

16
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,228
Tell Eden she's a hottie. Hook me up.

17
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,189
Tell her yourself. How's Pipe looking?

18
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,902
Whoa! It's going off!
It's at least double overhead.

19
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,278
You better get down here.

20
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,362
Okay. Thanks, JJ.

21
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,159
-Pen. Pen, come on. Get up. Penny. Get up.
-Mmm.

22
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,912
It's double overhead.

23
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,794
-Lena. Hey, Lena.
-What?

24
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,339
-It's double overhead.
-What?

25
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,681
How's it coming?

26
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,143
I can't get the rails right.
They're too pinched.

27
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,772
-You want to get wet?
-I gotta glass before work.

28
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,398
It's perfect Pipe.

29
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,569
-For real?
-For real.

30
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,738
- Let's go!
- Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

31
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,366
- Get a move on. Let's go.
- Let's go!

32
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,577
Okay, got my noodles. Let's go.

33
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,591
Turn it up.

34
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,847
Whoo-hoo!

35
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,100
It's going off!

36
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,241
-What's up, bro?

37
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,329
Great. The Rat Pack's here.

38
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,373
It's gonna be sick.
Look, Kehau and Braden are going.

39
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,582
You know it's gonna be sick.

40
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,917
-Hey. What's up, guys?
- Hey, Rico, what's up?

41
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,002
Hey, girls.

42
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,086
What's up? How you living, man?

43
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,671
We should have been here
at least an hour ago.

44
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,966
If you guys had gotten moving,
maybe we would've been.

45
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,593
- What's up, Tamayo?
-Hey. How's it, girls?

46
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,221
How is it out there?

47
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,849
Oh, It's pretty nuts. Broke my board.

48
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:55,354
It's pretty heavy out there.
Your girl got her head on straight this time?

49
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,858
-Does she?
-You know it.

50
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,217
-Oh, look who's here.
-Hey, what are you girls doing here?

51
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,053
Same thing you are. We came to surf Pipe.

52
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,971
Why don't you check out girlie bowls
or something?

53
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,848
Why don't you crawl back
into the cave you came from?

54
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,141
Why don't I knock you over the head

55
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,517
and drag you in there with me, huh?

56
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:37,646
-You just try that.
-I like girls that are rough and soft inside.

57
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,065
I'm gonna bury you, girl.

58
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,234
Let her go. Seriously, let her go.
We're out of here.

59
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,278
So, what's this I hear
about you surfing the Pipe Masters?

60
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,404
It's a surfing contest,

61
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,989
-not a drowning contest.

62
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,909
Hey, why don't you stop hassling my girl?
She's gonna dominate.

63
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,453
Let's see it.
I don't mind girls that can charge Pipe.

64
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,623
Chick thinks she can charge Pipe. That's
cool. You think she can surf it for real?

65
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,041
What, you think you can surf it for real?

66
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,251
Well, I dated you, Drew.
I guess I can do anything, huh?

67
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,422
Let's see it. I'll get my boys out there.
We'll block every single wave you want.

68
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,675
No matter how big it is, we want you on it.
Let's see what's gonna happen.

69
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,968
-Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

70
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,553
Don't talk bubbles to me. Let's see it.

71
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,108
-So, meet us at the shower at 7:45?
-Okay.

72
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,984
-And stay on the inside.
-Okay.

73
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,236
-Be careful, Pen.
-All right.

74
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,921
Looks like
the reef's breaking down.

75
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,969
Ooh, he got shut down.

76
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,226
-Ooh!
-It's heavy out there.

77
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,061
It's fierce.

78
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,071
He hit the reef.

79
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,783
That's gotta hurt.

80
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:18,247
I think we should start at the sandbar
and work our way over.

81
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,040
I won't argue with that.

82
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,079
Whoo!

83
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,174
Whoo!

84
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,131
Whoo!

85
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,015
I want to get a boat so we can, like,
go around the island

86
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,600
and get some killer secret spots.

87
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,769
-Guaranteed, there's so many.
-God, I know. I know.

88
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,606
Hey!
What's this horseshit on-the-sandbar crap?

89
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,191
You're not gonna win the Masters
surfing the sandbar.

90
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,028
Talking all this crap on the beach, like,
"I dated you, Drew. I can do anything."

91
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,863
This isn't Pipe. Pipe's over there.

92
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,409
Let's go! Pipe's over there.
The boys are gonna block for you.

93
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,288
--Let's do this. Let's go. Come on.

94
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,671
Whoo! Yeah!

95
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,104
Let's go, man.

96
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,107
Actions speak louder than words.

97
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,403
-Now, that's the view I remember.
-What, the one of me leaving?

98
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,071
It's my favorite, too.

99
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,163
Come on. Pick it up.

100
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,669
Like that wave, huh? Next one's yours.

101
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,354
Welcome to the arena, girl.
Let's get you into something big.

102
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,855
What's up, Anne Marie?
Where you been?

103
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,148
I thought you were right behind us.

104
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,734
Today's your big day. Let's do it.

105
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,862
Right. Hey, everybody. This is my girl,
Anne Marie. She's with the boys.

106
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,988
She's gonna get some waves out here.

107
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,907
Any of you get in her way,
you're gonna have to deal with me.

108
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,700
-Come on. Let's go.
- Here it comes. Come on.

109
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,743
Paddle, paddle!

110
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,119
Hurry up. Come on!

111
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,664
Watch out, watch out! Spring girl’s wave.

112
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,504
Go, Anne Marie! Paddle in!

113
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,422
- Come on!
- Paddle! Paddle! Paddle!

114
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,306
What the hell was that?

115
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,977
God!

116
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,439
-You ain't even paddling.
- Girls can't surf Pipe.

117
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,565
What the hell was that?

118
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,693
What the hell is she afraid of?

119
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,411
- This ain't a beauty pageant.
- You do that again, you're barred.

120
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,372
Come on, Anne Marie.
You gotta do it this time. No fooling around.

121
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,832
Let's do it.

122
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,425
This one's yours, right here. Don't blow it,
or I ain't gonna help you anymore.

123
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,137
Come on. Paddle, paddle!
This one's yours now. Go! Go!

124
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,479
Ooh!

125
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,875
You were in the perfect spot.
You were right where you needed to be.

126
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,626
Whatever. That thing was a beast.

127
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,879
-Just dropped out of nowhere.
- How big was it?

128
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,755
It was solid.
It was, like, triple overhead.

129
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,299
- She had that.
- Wow.

130
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,550
She totally had it.

131
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,969
Yeah, she just needed
to paddle a little harder.

132
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,345
I don't know.

133
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,349
It's all in your
head. It's all up here.

134
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,226
I'm telling you,
if you just would have committed,

135
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,895
you could have made that wave.

136
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,230
Whatever. At least she went.
That wave was huge.

137
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,523
I wouldn't have gone.

138
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,816
She was perfectly positioned
on the wave.

139
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,320
Why does the sun rise in
If she had the
balls to really charge it...

140
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,489
-What?
-Hey, why does the sun rise in the east?

141
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,826
-'Cause it sets in the west.
-Because that's the way the Earth rotates.

142
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,537
You remember that Supeman episode

143
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,291
where he was, like,
spinning around the Earth backwards,

144
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,002
trying to rotate it in the other direction?

145
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,962
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-To bring back time?

146
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,339
Penny, I thought you finished
your homework.

147
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,174
I did. I'm just checking it.

148
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,634
It doesn't look like
you're finished.

149
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,010
Geez, stop picking on her, dude.

150
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,053
She's getting it done now.

151
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,137
Yeah,
we're on our way to school.

152
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,263
No, I finished it.

153
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,681
She should've
had it done by last night.

154
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,849
I'm checking it.

155
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,727
- She's just checking it.
- I did it last night. I'm checking it.

156
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,066
- Penny! Penny!
-What?

157
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,150
Slippers.

158
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,945
No ditching.

159
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,154
Okay.

160
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,033
-It sucks to be you!
-Yeah, it does.

161
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,869
Someone's gotta go to college, honey.
Not me.

162
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,955
Shit. It's Mr. Pukui.

163
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,082
Remember how he used to have pee stains
all the time?

164
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,125
Looks like he learned
how to shake right.

165
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,460
-Hi, Mr. Pukui.
-Anne Marie,

166
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,880
this is the eighth time
your sister's been tardy in the last month.

167
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,799
-I know, traffic...
-If you think surfing

168
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,510
is more important than school,
we gotta make other arrangements.

169
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,594
You know what, Mr. Pukui?

170
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,473
The only other arrangement
I can think of right now is my mother,

171
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,934
and she just so happens to be
with her latest meal ticket in Vegas,

172
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,896
who apparently isn't so cool
with the kid's menu, you know what I mean?

173
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,482
So, right now,
this is the best arrangement I can do.

174
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,485
-You know, Penny's a smart girl.
-Yeah, she is.

175
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,948
-Just like her sister was.
-Is. Present tense.

176
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,742
I learned that much while I was here.

177
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,744
You'd better watch it, girl.

178
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,081
You know, I'm doing the best I can do.
That's all I can say.

179
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,833
You can do better.

180
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,253
God!

181
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,922
He's so ripping in that aloha shirt anyway.

182
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,674
I thought he was hot.

183
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,011
-You did kind of peak in seventh grade.
-Shut up, Lena.

184
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,263
-Sexually, she means.
-All right.

185
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,974
-What is this, like, bag on Anne Marie?

186
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Whoo!

187
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,231
-$1 7.53.
-That's kamaaina price?

188
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,774
No kamaaina for candy.

189
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,485
-Aw! Come on, Leilani. It's breakfast.
-Yeah.

190
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,114
-Breakfast? Right. Sorry, girls. $17.53.
- This has corn syrup in it.

191
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,866
-It's a vegetable.
-It's nutritional.

192
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,327
No, I don't think so.
It has sugar. Turns into fat,

193
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,995
and fat comes out like me, okay?

194
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,790
-So, $1 7.53.
-All right. I've got $5.

195
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,459
-I got some on me.
-How much do you have?

196
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,836
-Yeah, I got some cash.
-Hold on, I got like...

197
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,467
- What is this?
-I don't know, like, 70, 60...

198
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,968
That's pathetic. What is that?

199
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,347
I don't know. I didn't say I had a
lot of cash. I just said I had some.

200
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,641
What happened
to the five bucks I gave you yesterday?

201
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,851
- I bought food for Sammi.
-It's not even our dog, Lena.

202
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,978
-Dog's gotta eat.
-Well, so do I. I'm hungry.

203
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,856
-Eat the rest of this Twinkie.
-I don't want a Twinkie. I want breakfast.

204
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Twinkie is breakfast.

205
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,654
It's Keala Kennelly. She's living the life.

206
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,614
She must be here for the contest.

207
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,283
-Check those Jet Skis out.
-So fun.

208
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,077
All right, let's fill these bad boys up.

209
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,288
-It's gonna be a busy day.
-She's with her Billabong sponsor.

210
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,123
-You should go introduce yourself.
- No.

211
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,667
-Why not?
-Because it's weird.

212
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,793
It's not weird. You can go.

213
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,252
-Yes.
- No.

214
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,339
-Hi, can we have your autograph?
-Yeah, sure.

215
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,132
-I'll get you a pen.
-Thanks.

216
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,635
-Hey, I remember this shot. It's Backdoor.
- What a life.

217
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,012
She gets a grand
every time she's in a magazine.

218
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,681
Five grand every time she's on the cover.

219
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,224
-So, you surf?
-Yeah.

220
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:01,019
She gets free clothes, boards,
watches, sunglasses.

221
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,605
The girl doesn't have to open her wallet.

222
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,692
You know,
you score one good wave at Pipe Masters,

223
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,110
and you'll get sponsored just like her.

224
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,237
You'll get flown all around the world,

225
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,782
surf Indo, Australia, Tahiti. You name it.

226
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,033
Surf the world, baby.

227
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,661
And you'll get paid
to surf uncrowded, perfect waves.

228
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,455
-We'll see you at the contest.
-All right. Thanks. Bye.

229
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,793
All you need to do is get noticed.

230
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,877
Surfer girls.

231
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,629
Local girls!

232
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,840
You know, you're just as good as her.

233
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,093
We gotta go to work, guys.
We're gonna be late again.

234
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,757
-Girls, you're late.
-I know. Sorry.

235
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,014
Sorry.

236
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,440
As a reminder,
our Pro Bowl guests are arriving today.

237
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:33,528
They are VIP return guests,
and deserve the highest level of service.

238
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:39,701
We must remember, we depend on our guests
for the survival of our business.

239
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,906
Ew!

240
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,796
Look, this one packed for Vegas
and landed in Hawaii instead.

241
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,132
I'm putting it on.

242
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,134
How hot am I!

243
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,223
I don't have any boobs.

244
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,771
Guys, guys. It's up. It's up.

245
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,526
Look, "Anne Marie Chadwick." Picture.

246
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,698
"Wild-card entry.
This North Shore local first gained notice

247
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,784
"when she dominated in the junior NSSA."

248
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,536
-You dominated.
-Nice! No.

249
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,706
You're wearing my bathing-suit bottoms
in that.

250
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,207
-I know.
-"She dropped out of the competitive circuit

251
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,126
-"after a near-drowning incident..."
-Mmm.

252
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,880
-They love bringing that up, huh?
-That was three years ago.

253
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,549
It's over with. You're gonna go pro,
and you're gonna win this thing.

254
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,175
- I want to be on the Internet.

255
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,552
Oh, crap!

256
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,388
- Oh, my God.
- Hello? Is somebody in there?

257
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,099
- Be there in... I'm stuck!
-Put your shoes on.

258
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,810
-Help me. I'm stuck. Help me!
- Hello? Anyone in there?

259
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,353
Ow, ow!

260
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,774
-One second! One second!
- Can you open this door, please?

261
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,651
Be right with you.

262
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,156
Open this door right now.
I'm not fooling around.

263
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,953
-My shoes.
- Why was this door locked?

264
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,914
I'm sorry. I know. It gets stuck.

265
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,666
Maintenance will come up and look at it
in any second.

266
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,585
-What's going on in here?
-Just cleaning up.

267
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,462
We're just picking up the
clothes off the floor.

268
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,714
What happened to all the clothes
that was on the floor?

269
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,633
We just folded them up
and put them on the bed.

270
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,927
All right. I left the clothes on the floor
so that you would know

271
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,386
that they need to be dry-cleaned.

272
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,097
Okay, well, that's actually why we had
the dry-cleaning bags,

273
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,849
for that specific purpose.

274
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,018
Well, then,
why don't you put them in the bag?

275
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,687
-No problem.
-That's a cute top.

276
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:16,316
"Like, I need for you guys to put
all of my crusty clothes inside of the bag."

277
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
What about the bags in her boobs?

278
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,319
-Her boobs are as big as my head.

279
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,571
And I have one big head.

280
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,992
-Excuse us, please.
- Excuse us.

281
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,037
Don't mind us.

282
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:31,915
Football players.

283
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,083
-Excuse us.
-It's all right.

284
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,464
What?

285
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,093
Slobs.

286
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,484
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

287
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,328
Look at that. They're beautiful.

288
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,167
All right.
Next time, you're paddling.

289
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,920
How about you take a sweet, luscious run
right about now?

290
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,090
Oh, yeah, I don't think so.
You can go for it, though.

291
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,883
You're the one in training, not me.

292
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,428
Do you smell that?

293
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,102
Beer's gone.

294
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,522
Damn it. Penny?

295
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,942
Pen! Pen?

296
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,612
Penny?

297
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,955
Freaking pain in my royal ass! God!

298
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,125
Stop it, stop!

299
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,589
Gotta go. I gotta go.

300
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,800
Where you going, Anne Marie?
You too good for us?

301
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,942
Penny. Penny, get up. Get up!
We're going home. Come on.

302
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,777
-I'm not going anywhere.
-It's not a request. Get up!

303
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,155
-Go away. Leave me alone!
-No. Get up. Penny, get up!

304
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,032
-Get out of my face.
-I'm not kidding!

305
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,994
Stop! Leave me alone! Get off me!

306
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,622
-You're such a bitch!
-What are you doing?

307
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,374
Get off me!

308
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,794
-Why can't you leave me alone?
-'Cause I'm all you have, Penny!

309
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,295
I'm all you have right now!

310
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,047
I don't want you! I don't care!

311
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:30,343
You're the one who made Mom leave!
You were screwing up all the time!

312
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,845
You know what? Fine.

313
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,472
Fine!

314
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,103
We're over this. Turn the music up.

315
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,438
You all right?

316
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,041
Thanks for the ride.

317
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,239
You should just send her
to military school.

318
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,533
You should just shave her head.
That ought to send a message.

319
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,994
You guys are such hypocrites.
We totally partied at her age.

320
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,164
-We did not. We were not 14.
-More like 1 2.

321
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,791
Whose fault is that?
You guys were supposed to be my examples.

322
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,210
-Oh, what?
-Please!

323
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,712
Yeah, like we were the ones
who forced you during freshman year

324
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,174
to climb up the rain gutter
at the Volcom House and steal their rum.

325
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,676
-Shit.
-You remember that?

326
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,054
Ah, don't worry about it.
I mean, we turned out fine, right?

327
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,890
Housekeeping. Housekeeping.

328
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,688
-Oh, shit.
-God, that reeks. What is that?

329
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,816
-What is that smell?
-I'm not doing this. Uh-uh.

330
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,779
-What is that smell?
-Freaking nasty. That's what it is.

331
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,948
-It reeks in this room.
-This really sucks, right here.

332
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,076
- Oh, my God.
-All right. Let's just get started.

333
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,619
-All right.
- Ew! Sick!

334
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,829
-What?

335
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,544
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God, that...

336
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,463
-I'm not cleaning that up.
-We have to do it.

337
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,173
-We have to get it done.
-I'm not cleaning that up.

338
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,634
-We gotta get it done.
It's just the way it is. -It's so sick.

339
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,011
-No-neck pigs.
-Help me make the bed, Lena.

340
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,179
Ugh!

341
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,640
Football players are so nasty.

342
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,433
I mean,
I don't even know where to start.

343
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,893
They think
they can get away with anything.

344
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,603
This is ridiculous.

345
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,855
-Ugh! Sick!
- What?

346
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,941
-Get it off, Anne Marie! It's stuck!
-What?

347
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,443
-It's not coming off!
-What? What is it?

348
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,611
-It's a condom.

349
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,531
- It's stuck!
- No, don't touch it!

350
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,702
-Get it off! Get it off!
-Get it off.

351
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,871
- Put some gloves on.
-Get it off!

352
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:08,626
Just relax. I can't get it
if you're frigging tossing around.

353
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,712
- That's nasty.
- Oh, my God!

354
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:11,963
Ugh!

355
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,300
Oh, sick! Ugh!

356
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,887
You know what? That's it.

357
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,432
Wedding and honeymoon
in the same place?

358
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,767
Girls, I'm hot.
Come on. Let's go snorkeling or something.

359
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,812
I am not snorkeling with this hair.
Give me a break.

360
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,398
I know! Those masks leave the worst marks
on your face.

361
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,859
-There's, like, 1 00 people's spit in them.
-Ooh!

362
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,861
Anybody in room 21 5?

363
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:41,159
-21 5? You ladies in 21 5? Gentlemen! 21 5?

364
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,911
Anybody in room 21 5?

365
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,334
-No? Anybody in room 21 5 out in the water?
-What?

366
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,795
-Suite 21 5? Is it yours?
-Oh.

367
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,094
Jump!

368
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,179
I'm in 21 5.

369
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,973
-I swear to God, that's a condom.
- I think I won something.

370
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,852
-I'm in 21 5. What'd I win?
-Hi. I'm Anne Marie.

371
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,103
I'm the housekeeper of your room.

372
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,273
-Leslie. O-line!
-O-line!

373
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,360
-Do you have a sec, Leslie?
-Sure, take all the time you want.

374
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,444
Sugar wugar.

375
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,528
Step one.

376
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,197
Ew!

377
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,949
Step two.

378
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,664
And step three. You got it?
Thanks for your time, guys.

379
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,377
-No problem.
-Ooh! You got schooled by the maid, homie.

380
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,754
-I'm on vacation.
-You still got schooled by the maid.

381
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,714
But you don't have to clean your room
when you're on vacation.

382
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,050
-You got schooled by the maid.
-But you don't have to clean your room

383
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,968
when you're on vacation!

384
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,639
I'm on vacation.

385
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,894
It was gross! It was disgusting!

386
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,229
I don't care what they did.

387
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,815
They are VIP. Pay the highest rate.

388
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,651
They don't pay good money
to be scolded by a housekeeper.

389
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,862
You can pick up your last check next week.
Surf's up, Anne Marie.

390
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,532
-They peed on the floor.
-There was puke all over the curtain.

391
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,033
Please don't suspend me.
We need the money.

392
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,369
I'm not suspending you. I'm firing you.

393
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,205
-What?
-Well, if she's fired, I quit.

394
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,707
-Me, too.
-Fine.

395
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,586
-You're seriously gonna fire all of us?
-No, I'm firing you.

396
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,424
They quit. So don't get any ideas
about collecting unemployment.

397
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,222
You guys, don't quit.
We need to make rent.

398
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,679
You could've stayed down longer than that.

399
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,223
I'm tired of holding my breath, Eden.

400
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,732
God,
she just loves pissing me off.

401
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,068
Look at her. She's not even out here to get
waves. She just wants to get attention.

402
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,487
What does she see in those guys anyway?

403
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,654
They're such burnouts.

404
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,323
-Same thing you did.
-What?

405
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,949
Cut body and a nice cutback.

406
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,287
-She's right.
- She's got a bad attitude.

407
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,874
It's not who she is.

408
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,513
Inside! Got it! I'm on it!

409
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,398
Hey, hey, hey! Got it!

410
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,487
Hey!

411
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,990
I'm on it! Get off!

412
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,204
Drew, I got it!

413
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,545
Hey!

414
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,943
I had the section. What's your problem?

415
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,404
You need to grow up.

416
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,739
It's not my fault you broke your board,
you stupid kook.

417
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,117
No, you're a kook!
Don't ever drop down on me again!

418
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:54,203
Yeah, that's right.
Go home. Beat it, blondie.

419
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,639
-Can you glue it back together?
-No.

420
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,601
-I was just driving by.
-Okay.

421
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,355
Well, actually, the guy at the hotel
told me where I could find you.

422
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,568
So, that's pretty awesome,
you know. Surfing.

423
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,486
-Right.
-Hey, listen,

424
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:32,366
I wanted to apologize
for my friend back at the hotel.

425
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,662
You know, Leslie's kind of messy, but when
your ass is hanging out in the pocket,

426
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,123
he's the guy you want
protecting your backside.

427
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:44,170
So, next time your ass is hanging back
in the pocket, he's your guy.

428
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,715
-I'll remember that.
- Hey, what's up, Anne Marie?

429
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,176
-Hey, Ben. How're you doing?
-You broke your board? That sucks.

430
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,178
-Yeah.
-Bet you were charging, though.

431
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,597
-Something like that.
-Hey, don't I know you?

432
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,724
-I don't know, maybe.
-Yeah, you're that quarterback.

433
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,894
-Yeah, I play some football.
-That's right, huh?

434
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,271
Nice shoes, bro.

435
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,233
Thanks.

436
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,154
Um, anyway, I was wondering
if maybe you've taught anybody.

437
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,531
-Taught anybody?
-Yeah, how to surf.

438
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,826
-No.
-Well, you know, I've got some free time.

439
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,497
-That's nice.
-Well, I'd love to learn.

440
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,583
-It's not easy.
-I know, but it looks really fun out there.

441
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,127
- You can get hurt.
-I'm sure I could handle myself.

442
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,004
You know what? There's this guy Rick.

443
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,007
He'll set you up with a sponge board
and some baby waves.

444
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,510
-He's gentle.
-And you are?

445
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,262
-Not.
-Right.

446
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,266
-Check it out.
- Who's GQ jock?

447
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,732
Hey. What was that all about?

448
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,693
I don't know.
He wanted lessons or something.

449
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,777
- Anne Marie!
-What?

450
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,404
Lessons? Money? We're broke?

451
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,949
-Well, he didn't say anything about paying.
-Well, did you ask?

452
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,952
-You guys are going tonight? No. What time?
- Go, go, go!

453
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,373
-I don't know. I'm kind of lost.
- Go get him, go get him!

454
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,208
-Hey! Hey!
-I'll try to make it. Hang on.

455
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,459
-What?
-How much?

456
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,128
-What?
- How much?

457
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,880
-I'll have to call you back.
-Shit!

458
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,220
Hey! Watch where you're going!

459
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,393
Hurry up! Go get him. Come on.

460
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:24,937
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry!

461
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,523
For lessons. How much?

462
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,900
I don't know. What's the going rate?

463
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,990
-Twenty bucks an hour.
-$20?

464
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,953
-Too much?
-$1 5?

465
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:45,291
-$1 5?
-The hotel charges $1 50. I'll pay that.

466
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:51,046
150 bucks! For surf lessons?
That's it, right?

467
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,341
-What else are we talking about?
-Got any friends?

468
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,926
Sure I do.

469
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,095
Whoo! Yeah!

470
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,815
-What's with the face, Pen?
-What face?

471
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,692
Don't worry, honey.
It's just one afternoon.

472
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,278
You'll still have plenty of time
to get pregnant and go on welfare.

473
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,030
-Good idea.
- It'll be fun, Pen.

474
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,074
-We'll play rip off the tourist.
-We're not ripping anyone off.

475
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:24,121
Anyone who pays $1,000 a night
for a room is just begging to be ripped off.

476
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,123
I saw those guys
walk into Tommy Bahama yesterday

477
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,042
and drop four Gs on silk boxers.

478
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,127
Yeah.
How is that possible? It's underwear.

479
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,297
Yeah, those guys got money to burn.
They play in the NFL. Are you kidding?

480
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,383
I don't care about the money.
Anything is better than this.

481
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,637
-Oh, my God.
- Yeah, right.

482
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,931
- Let me out here, you guys.
-Penny.

483
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,141
I thought his friends would be hot at least.

484
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,102
-This is so embarrassing to be seen with you.

485
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,729
You gonna teach us how to surf?

486
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,022
Teach us how to surf.

487
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,899
I'm ready to go, baby.

488
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,528
Hey, guys, come on. It's $1 50 each.

489
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,196
What if we see people we know? God.

490
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,824
- Whatever. It's surf lessons.
- So this is what jocks look like?

491
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,701
- One hundred and fifty bucks.
-Let's go surfing, big daddy.

492
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,912
What's up, girls?

493
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,459
This is Lena and Eden. I'm Anne Marie.

494
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,169
-Hi.
-Hey.

495
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,382
If you don't watch out,
I'll make sure you drown out there.

496
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:20,594
-Hey, how's it going? Matt. Nice to meet you.
- This is my little sister, Penny.

497
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,265
What's up, little mama? Little surf baby.

498
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,520
-You're gonna surf in that? -Hell,
no. I'm gonna surf in my da-da-da-da's.

499
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,107
- In your what?
-My da-da-da-da's!

500
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,031
-You're wearing nut huggers.
- Some might call them that.

501
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,784
I call them nut containers.
You're gonna teach me how to surf.

502
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,370
-On three?
-One, two, three.

503
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,414
Snap up!

504
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:51,834
No duck butt.

505
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,045
Oh, yeah.

506
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,468
Oh! Hell, no!

507
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,679
Come on. Go! Paddle!

508
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,973
Come on! Come on, Leslie.

509
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,525
-Go!
-Call me.

510
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,235
Whoo! Yeah!

511
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,802
-Whoa!
-Ahh!

512
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,688
Ooh!

513
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,280
-Okay. Ready?
-Okay.

514
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,867
All right. Start paddling! Paddle! Go! Go!

515
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:11,121
Yeah! Yes! Get up! Get up! Get up!

516
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:16,502
Put your head in the center.
Lean forward. Hula hands! Come on! Go!

517
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,379
Whoa!

518
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:19,922
Yeah!

519
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,719
Come on. Get back out here! One more time!

520
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,932
Hey, I'm giving a lesson.

521
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,606
There you go. Come on. Paddle, paddle.

522
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:41,944
Whoo!

523
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,237
Yeah!

524
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,449
That was so good.

525
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,537
-That was so good.
-That was incredible.

526
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,205
Whoa!

527
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,458
-Are you psyched?
-Yeah, totally.

528
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,419
Let's go and catch one of those big ones.

529
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,631
-Out there? Okay, sure you can handle it?
-Yeah. Definitely.

530
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,016
Come on, Matt. You got it,
you got it. Paddle, paddle, paddle.

531
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,352
Harder. Come on. You gotta dig.

532
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,563
All right, Anne Marie,
I'm right there with you.

533
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,442
Don't worry about me. I got this mastered.

534
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,403
I am a football player. Oh, shit!

535
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,786
A couple more. You got it.
Just a couple more waves.

536
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,255
Dig! Turtle!
Get under your board! Turn it over!

537
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,639
Don't give up. Come on. Paddle.

538
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,854
All right, here we go.
Gotta make it over this wave. Here we go.

539
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,647
-Paddle, paddle.
-Hey, get out of the way!

540
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,024
Harder. There you go.

541
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,158
-You okay?
-Oh, man, that was intense.

542
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,452
I know. It's getting big out here.
Sure you don't want to go in?

543
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,330
-No. I mean, are we safe out here?

544
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:21,168
That depends what you think is safe,
but yeah, pretty much.

545
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,591
- How about this one here?
- No, this one's not a wave.

546
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,426
Almost.

547
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,970
We'll get you one, Matt. I promise.
Come on back.

548
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,057
- Oh, man.
-Just be patient, Matt. We'll get you one.

549
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,392
Anne Marie! We're leaving!

550
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,273
Hey, sweetie. Why don't you come over here
and help me out a little bit?

551
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,192
Gonna need two of us to carry this one.

552
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,944
Maybe we should go in.
It's getting late.

553
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,654
I'm not leaving
until I catch one of these things.

554
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,323
-How about this one?
-Okay, yeah, turn around, quick. Egg beat.

555
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:59,540
There you go, Matt. This is it. Paddling.
Start paddling. Go! Go! Paddle! Paddle!

556
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,210
Stand up. Stand up.

557
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,889
Yeah!

558
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:17,558
Whoo!

559
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,602
Whoa!

560
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,898
-Yes! Yeah!
-There you go! Good job, Matt! Whoo!

561
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,651
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

562
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,236
-Good job.
-Yes.

563
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,782
Good evening.

564
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:34,867
Hi. Welcome to the Lanakai.

565
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,702
No, it's all right.
I'm just dropping him off.

566
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,495
Wait. Why don't you come in for a drink?

567
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,917
-Yeah, no, I'd love to, but I...
-But what?

568
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:49,256
I have to get back to my side of the island.
You know what I mean?

569
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,467
-Uh, no. Why?
-'Cause I'm in training.

570
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,888
-Pipe... Line.
-Pipeline.

571
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,515
-Master. Pipe Masters, right.
-Pipe Masters, right.

572
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,728
Well, I tell you what.

573
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,815
-Uh, I've only got 40 bucks.
-For what?

574
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,319
For you. For the lesson.

575
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:15,574
But if you want to come up to my room,
I'll give you the rest of the money.

576
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:22,456
I would really like to do that,
but see those guys over there?

577
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,041
They see us heading up to your room,

578
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,585
half the island's gonna have us
sleeping together by tomorrow morning,

579
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,711
-guaranteed.
-Really?

580
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,962
It's the coconut wireless. Yeah.

581
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,839
-That's very serious.
-It's great. Yeah.

582
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:34,885
All right. Well, in that case, you wait here.
I'll come right back with your money.

583
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,346
All right. Wait.

584
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:42,517
-I'll come up.
-You sure?

585
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,853
Okay. 'Cause I don't want
to ruin your reputation or anything.

586
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,105
Thanks. I'll worry about that.

587
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,732
-All right.
-Okay.

588
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,944
You go up the elevator. I'll go up
the back way, so it's, like, inconspicuous.

589
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,072
-It's so sneaky. It's like James Bond.
-Just shut up.

590
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,840
Excuse me.

591
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:42,703
What the hell is she doing?

592
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,206
-Hey.
-Hey.

593
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,708
Where you going?

594
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,503
I just...
I didn't know if that was your room or not.

595
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,422
-It's my room.
-Yeah.

596
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,507
-Come in.
-Okay. Thanks.

597
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,887
Wow.

598
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,726
-Looks different at night.
-Yeah, it's pretty nice.

599
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,897
-I'm just gonna go...
-It's right there.

600
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,066
I know where it is. Thanks.

601
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,472
What are you doing?

602
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:47,768
I'm just trying to find the money that I hid.

603
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,270
-What, from the maid?
-Yeah. Right.

604
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:57,486
Uh, let's see.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

605
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,280
-eight, nine...
-Wait. That's way, way...

606
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:05,243
That's $1,000. I'll be here a week.
That's $1 50 a day,

607
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:10,207
so I gave myself a $50 discount
for paying upfront.

608
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,587
-Are you trying to buy me?
-No. No. I just don't want to lose you.

609
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,438
-Can I ask you a really weird question?

610
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:36,191
-Yeah.
-Are you wearing my cologne?

611
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:38,985
Yes.

612
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,864
It smells good on you.

613
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,167
-You should probably get that.
-Yeah. Right.

614
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,676
Yeah? Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

615
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,886
Are you feeling better?

616
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,140
Yeah, no, I tried to call earlier,
but no one was there.

617
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,476
Yeah, I miss you, too. I miss you, too.

618
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,770
-It's been hectic.
-Matt, I'm gonna...

619
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:18,191
Listen, let me call you back, all right?
All right.

620
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,654
I love you, too. All right. Bye.

621
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,448
Sorry.

622
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:28,285
I guess that's why
they have that no-fraternization rule.

623
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,369
What do you mean?

624
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,706
Management gets call
from irate wife

625
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,625
wondering why maid is in husband's room
at 2:00 in the morning.

626
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,004
-That's not my wife.
-Wife, girlfriend, boyfriend.

627
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,798
No, really. It's not my wife.
Look, it's my niece.

628
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:45,719
Actually, my sister's daughter, Rebecca.
There she is.

629
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,600
I swear.

630
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,146
-She's beautiful.
-Yeah, she is. She's a sweetheart.

631
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:00,192
Sorry about that. It's kind of strange
with the time difference and all.

632
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,569
I should probably go. It's getting late.

633
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,198
All right. Do I have a surf lesson tomorrow?

634
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,950
-Definitely.
-All right.

635
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,118
Okay.

636
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,414
-Bye.
-Bye.

637
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,542
Bye.

638
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,364
I thought you were
just giving him lessons.

639
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,491
-I did.
- Yeah, in what?

640
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,493
Penny didn't finish her homework.

641
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,371
-You weren't here to help me.
-Guys, she's gotta do her homework.

642
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,623
Don't give us shit
'cause you were out there working it.

643
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,167
-Shut up.
- Don't deny it.

644
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:03,463
You were working it
like a rib without the sauce.

645
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,259
-What happened?
-Oh, my God. Nothing.

646
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,553
Oh, sure. Tell me what happened.

647
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,722
-No.
-Did you get some play? Did you? Did you?

648
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,891
We kissed for, like, two seconds.
It wasn't a big deal.

649
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,270
I'm sure you did.
How much am I supposed to buy that for?

650
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,564
-God, what do you take me for?
- I don't know.

651
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,568
-Seriously. What else? Come on.
-Here, this will pay the bills.

652
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,406
There's, like, $1,000 here.
I feel like your pimp.

653
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,243
You must know how to kiss, huh?
Or you must know how to do something else.

654
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,204
--Goodnight, Penny. You're going to bed now.

655
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,003
-Hey.
-What's up?

656
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,468
Look, I hate to be the buzzkill here,

657
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:55,098
but the contest is in a week,
and I just don't think that it's time for...

658
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,727
I know. But I did promise him
another lesson tomorrow.

659
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:03,189
-Can't you just blow him off?
-No.

660
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,692
-Why not?
-Because he already paid me.

661
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,278
-Exactly.
-Eden.

662
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,948
Well, I wanted
to rent a Jet Ski tomorrow.

663
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,201
Put you into some size.
Get you ready for Pipe.

664
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,911
All right, well,
I'll meet you at the launch at 4:00.

665
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,663
Why not earlier?

666
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,459
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

667
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,130
Where are we going again?

668
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,633
A little spot the hotel
does not tell the tourists about.

669
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:41,811
- Oh, my God. You drive like you surf.
- I drive like I wish I surfed.

670
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,486
-Wow. This is beautiful.
-Yeah, I used to come here when I was a kid.

671
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,529
I've been dreaming
about surfing all night.

672
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,157
-Oh, Minnesota's got surf stoke, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

673
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,412
Go!

674
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,707
- Whoa! Hop on.

675
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:06,878
Watch out. Whoa.

676
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,014
--Yeah!

677
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,079
How many sisters you got, Minnesota?

678
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,622
-Uh, five.
-Five?

679
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,542
-Five.
-Really? You're the only boy?

680
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,044
-Uh, yep.
-That explains it, then.

681
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,129
Explains what?

682
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,048
That's why you're not intimidated by women.

683
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,551
-Yeah.
-Why is that funny?

684
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,053
Because I'm scared shitless of women.

685
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:01,891
My sisters would beat me on a regular basis.
See, look.

686
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,310
-See how I can't extend my finger?
-Yes.

687
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,397
'Cause my sister Dana broke it
when I was eight,

688
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,315
just because I wouldn't get out of her room.

689
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,234
Because it's broken that way,

690
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,988
when I throw the football,
it gives it a nice little zip.

691
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,323
-A nice little touch?
-Exactly.

692
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,911
Uh, I think we got company.

693
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,165
-Oh, great.
-What's up?

694
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,375
-You know those guys?
-Yeah, I do. We gotta go.

695
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,461
-Really?
-Yeah.

696
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,254
Prepare to get vibed.

697
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,841
This place is kapu.
That means off-limits to you, haole.

698
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,892
- What's up, guys?
-This is a local spot.

699
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,435
-Yeah, and I'm a local.
-He's not.

700
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,479
-What's up, haole boy?
-Drew, back off.

701
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:48,646
We grew here. You flew here.

702
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,482
It's not his fault.
I'm sorry for bringing him.

703
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,150
What are you doing on our beach, haole boy?

704
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,777
You don't live here, you don't surf here.

705
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,069
Drew,
we'll be out in five seconds.

706
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,988
This is a local spot.
Hey. This place is for the boys.

707
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,866
You know not to bring this guy over
here, Anne Marie. What's up with that?

708
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,451
Why don't you just relax, brah?

709
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,995
-"Brah?" You telling me "brah"?
- Drew.

710
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,955
-Where are you from, you honky?
-Drew, stop it.

711
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,457
-You want some of this?
-Drew, stop it.

712
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,708
-Don't even touch me.
-Don't touch her.

713
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:09,959
-What are you gonna do?
-Drew, grow up!

714
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,586
I've got his wallet.
We're out of here. Let's go surf.

715
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,547
Stop, stop, stop. Drew, stop!
Act like an adult.

716
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,424
Just get in the car. Seriously, stop it.
Walk away.

717
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,468
Seriously, stop it.
Why do you have to be like this?

718
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,428
-Right, get over there.
-Don't touch her.

719
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:22,347
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

720
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,270
- Please! What are you doing?
-You want some of this?

721
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,355
Drew!

722
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,489
Both of you! Get off! That's enough! Stop!
Get off!

723
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,866
Get in the car! Stop it!
Stop. Get in the car.

724
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,619
Now, stop it. Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

725
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,703
Walk away.

726
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,080
You're an asshole.

727
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,249
I do what I do best.

728
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,376
-Relax, bro.
-You kicked his ass.

729
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,752
-What?
-Kicked his ass.

730
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:56,256
- Nice meeting you guys.
-Beat it. Go back to the mainland.

731
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,392
This is bullshit.

732
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:12,355
Kawela's? And you expected
to make it back in time?

733
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,315
-I rented a Jet Ski.
-Eden, I know.

734
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,401
I'm sorry. I said I was
sorry a hundred times.

735
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,111
-Whatever.
-She's scared, man.

736
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,445
Hello?

737
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,782
What'd she say?

738
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,493
She's messing up, man.

739
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,345
-Everything okay?
-Oh, yeah. We'll be okay.

740
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:49,058
I can see why the tourists here
never leave their hotels.

741
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:54,606
Oh! Don't say that. That's not real Hawaii.
They're just... They're just crazy.

742
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,401
They're so protective of their land
and their waves, especially.

743
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,485
-And their women?

744
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,242
-What?
-I'm glad I'm here.

745
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,325
-I have to go to practice.
-I'll get up.

746
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,494
-No, no, no, no. Sleep in.
-Are you sure?

747
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:52,080
-Yeah, you sleep.
-Okay.

748
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:53,498
-Bye.
-Bye.

749
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,089
Shit. Shit.

750
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,064
-Hello?
- Lena, it's me.

751
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,609
-Hey. Where are you?
-Don't worry about it.

752
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,238
-You're at his room, huh?
-It's none of your business.

753
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,532
Listen, I just want to make sure
Penny gets to school okay.

754
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,367
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

755
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,786
-What happened?
-I will tell you everything.

756
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,204
Come on, little hooch.

757
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,706
Shut up. Oh, my God.

758
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,085
-All right.
-Bye.

759
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,752
Room service.
Can I help you?

760
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,837
Yes, I'd like to order
some breakfast, please.

761
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,424
Of course, Mrs. Tollman. What can I get you?

762
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,967
Uh, the blueberry waffles.

763
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,488
Housekeeping!

764
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,911
Well, aloha! Look at you,
little miss princess.

765
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,246
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,249
-So the glass slipper fit, huh?
-I even went in the pool.

767
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,960
-Shut up! You're so irritating!

768
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,755
It's wasn't my fault. He abducted me
and forced me to eat blueberry waffles.

769
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,799
-Blueberry waffles? Where?
-Outside.

770
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:08,883
Nice.

771
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,728
-What are you doing?
-Helping.

772
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,315
-Why? You're not a maid anymore.
-Come on, Eden. Don't be mad at me.

773
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,025
I'm not mad.

774
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,779
Mmm. These are so good. You didn't
save me any whipped cream, though.

775
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:35,451
Some guy thinks you look hot in a bikini,
and you forget all about the contest.

776
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,912
That's not fair, and you know it.

777
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:41,457
-Champagne? How cheesy are you?
-Shut up!

778
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,209
I'm not mad.

779
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:47,004
It's just...
I happen to know that you kick ass out there,

780
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,342
and you worked very hard
to get to where you are.

781
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:52,718
I know.

782
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:58,349
Pipe is in three days.
Every single sponsor is here.

783
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,936
And it's just you and one
other girl out there.

784
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,314
-I know. I got it. Okay?
-People would kill to be in your shoes.

785
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,024
I got it!

786
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:14,574
Hey, listen to me.
Contest comes first. Nothing changes that.

787
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,782
I'm gonna whip it around
and put you into this left!

788
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,491
Yeah!

789
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,294
Whoo!

790
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,338
Yeah.

791
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,151
This is it. This is it, right there!

792
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,222
Yeah!

793
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:54,900
Shit!

794
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,829
Anne Marie!

795
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,373
Where are you?

796
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,961
Anne Marie!

797
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,266
Eden, over here!

798
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,608
Get on! Get on!
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

799
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,277
I got you! I got you! Hold on.

800
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,156
Move! What's wrong? Gun it!

801
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,949
-Eden, get out of here!
-Oh, shit!

802
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,661
Bail, bail, bail!

803
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,961
-You all right?
-Where were you?

804
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,588
I was right behind you.
I couldn't get in without getting crushed.

805
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,258
You whipped me in way too deep,
and you need to kick out earlier.

806
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,260
-Are you done with your excuses now?
-I want to go in.

807
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,386
We'll rest for a minute.

808
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,264
I don't want to get some rest!
I almost frigging died out there!

809
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,392
You did not almost die.
You were under for, like, five seconds.

810
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:55,062
-Stop being such a Barbie.
-What did you say to me? What?

811
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,691
A Barbie? What is your problem?

812
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:03,529
Look, all I'm saying
is that if you can't handle this,

813
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,781
there's no way you're gonna be ready
for the Pipe Masters.

814
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:08,701
Then you go!
You're so frigging ballsy, Eden, you go!

815
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,828
I can't. I wasn't invited.

816
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:15,458
-I don't know what the hell you want from me.
-You know, what I want from you

817
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,793
is to get your own life
and stop living through me!

818
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,296
Get your own dreams!

819
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,720
So that's it?
You gonna go run off and be a pro-ho, huh?

820
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,390
At least I have someone
that's interested in me!

821
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:44,653
Why does this seem so familiar, huh?
Run away when things get tough.

822
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,656
"I'm stressed out.
I think I'm gonna ditch my kid

823
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:51,702
-"and run away with some guy I just met."
-Shut up, Eden. I'm not kidding.

824
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,288
-Sounds a little bit too familiar.
-Leave me alone!

825
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,916
-Like mother, like daughter.
-Shut up!

826
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,626
That's what you're gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?

827
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,836
-Get out of my face, Eden.
-You gonna prove these guys right?

828
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:04,507
Assholes who think that you can't surf Pipe
because you don't have the balls!

829
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,927
I guess so, then, 'cause I quit. I quit!

830
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,473
You're not a quitter. You're just scared.

831
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,690
Hey.

832
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:22,775
Oh, my God. What's wrong?

833
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,239
-Are you okay?
-No.

834
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,869
Wow, Rochelle Ballard rips!

835
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,915
You wiped out! Sorry, Rochelle.

836
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,419
-Where's Anne Marie?
-Who cares? Let me play.

837
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,756
- Hey, it's my turn.
- You got beat.

838
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,803
It's hump day.
Wednesday, February 3.

839
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:55,391
We've got that high-surf advisory in effect
for the north and northwest-facing shores.

840
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,106
There's definitely some size out there
in the water.

841
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,775
Sounds a little bit too familiar.

842
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,318
Like mother, like daughter.

843
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:14,201
This is your dream.
This is what you were born to do.

844
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,291
-Don't throw it away on this guy.
- Eden!

845
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,009
You're not a quitter.
You're just scared.

846
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,761
I'm gonna be
the best surfer in the world.

847
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:38,309
And it's just you
and one other girl out there.

848
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,936
It’s just you and one other girl out there.

849
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,589
-Shit!
-What are you doing?

850
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,507
Nothing.

851
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:12,843
-Wow. You look...
-What?

852
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,553
-Where'd you get that?
-What?

853
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,306
-The dress.
-From a store.

854
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,809
-He bought it?
-Yes, he bought it. So what?

855
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,312
-So, I can see your boobs!
-Great.

856
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,648
-I think she looks beautiful.
-Thank you.

857
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,651
-She looks the way he wants her to look.
-Like Baywatch Barbie.

858
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,860
Penny, shut up.

859
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,364
-Is he gonna buy you implants, too?
-Penny! I just can't do this right now, okay?

860
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,449
Man, that girl could rip.

861
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,246
-Who is that?
-You.

862
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:46,460
That was the first time you beat me
at the Menehune Contest in Haleiwa.

863
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,505
You were such a cocky little shit.

864
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:54,218
Always talking all that trash
and how you would be number one.

865
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,805
I was so pissed at you,
'cause I knew you would be.

866
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
All talented and shit.

867
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,852
The boys were spinning. Remember that?

868
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:07,773
They had to throw up some bullshit rule
barring you from the boys' contest.

869
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,781
-I'm gonna be late.
-He's leaving in a few days with a tan.

870
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,827
And what are you gonna be left with?
A pair of shoes?

871
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,884
-I wanted platinum, but...
-At least it's an eight.

872
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,720
-It is?
-It better be.

873
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:40,055
He said it was. One and a half.

874
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,852
-Everybody thinks I'm sexy.
I'm the sexiest...
-You ain't sexy!

875
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,395
He don't know anything.

876
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,064
-Very Tiffany's.
-Then you always get to be at Tiffany's.

877
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:52,025
He likes your little some-some.
A little loving one night...

878
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,154
-Maybe then, you know.
-And then you get yourself a little upgrade.

879
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,869
Good evening, miss.
Welcome to the Lanakai.

880
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,078
Jimmy, are you kidding me?

881
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:06,248
-It's me. It's Anne Marie.
-Holy shit! You look insane!

882
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,459
-Thank you.
-All right.

883
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,429
-Wow. You look...
-Weird.

884
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,056
-No. No. Gorgeous.
-Really?

885
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,020
Let's go show you off. Ah!

886
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:44,077
Okay, now it's time
for a few of you lucky men

887
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,829
to learn how to do the Tahitian hula.

888
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,457
-Do we have any volunteers?
-Hell, yeah!

889
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,543
Some intelligent men. Some men of size.

890
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,340
Here I go. All right. Wish me luck.

891
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:01,386
Get those hands up in the air. Come on, now.

892
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,982
Come on. Let's go, everybody. Totally freaky!

893
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,001
Shake that thing. Come on!

894
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:39,049
Shake that thing. Come on! Show them
what you're worth! Shake that thing!

895
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:57,192
How's it, wave riders?
We got that high-surf advisory posted again.

896
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:00,821
Right now, it's a macking 15-to-20 feet.

897
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:05,701
Out at Pipeline tomorrow,
the girls have the place all to themselves.

898
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,704
So, what are we supposed
to talk about with her anyways?

899
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,622
Windex, I guess, or Comet.

900
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,375
The only person who knows
anything about Windex or Comet

901
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,544
-in our house is Carmen, not me.
-You're right.

902
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,714
Right. Seriously, you guys, I hope
she doesn't think he's gonna marry her.

903
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:22,426
Of course she does. Prince
Charming coming to save her from the toilets.

904
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,720
And get some of
that $1 0 million a year.

905
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,931
Oh, God!
Matt and the maid. It's classic.

906
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,727
Oh, my God.
Did you guys check out that dress? Hello?

907
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,646
God, where does she think
she's going, anyway? The prom?

908
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,190
You guys,
I thought her shoes were totally cute.

909
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:40,986
Trust me on this. He made her up.
The whole Matt Tollman makeover.

910
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,196
Did you see the shoes, the dress,
the bracelet?

911
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,365
His classic line.

912
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,160
Oh, my God.

913
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,245
Do you guys remember
the Denny's waitress?

914
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,997
That's right. I remember.

915
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,416
She was from Denny's.
I knew she looked familiar.

916
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,503
Matt loves to slum. That's just how he is.

917
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,923
Come on. That's his style.

918
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,468
-He likes those cheap, little...
-Cheap Barbie...

919
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,970
Here. They're all yours.

920
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,311
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God. Was that just her?

921
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,647
-It was.
-She was here.

922
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:20,108
Our dancer tonight is Chief...
What's your name?

923
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,235
Leslie, but everybody calls me Poon Daddy!

924
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,322
- Aloha, Chief Poon Daddy!
-Aloha, Chief Poon Daddy!

925
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,032
Oh, yeah!

926
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:29,284
Baby, go!

927
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,454
Yeah. Shake it for us!

928
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:37,000
-You got milk in those coconuts?
- Shake it, shake it, shake it!

929
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,881
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

930
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,970
Anne Marie. Where are you going?
Anne Marie? Stop.

931
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,266
What the... Oh, man.

932
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,561
Ah, Anne Marie, what...

933
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,321
Anne Marie.

934
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,748
-What the hell are you doing?
-I don't know, Matt. What am I doing?

935
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:23,005
The other day,
when I was ordering room service,

936
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,466
the guy on the phone called me
"Mrs. Tollman," and I didn't correct him,

937
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,595
'cause for a minute,
I liked the way it sounded.

938
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:36,768
And I was just wondering
if the Denny's waitress felt the same way.

939
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,731
-Listen...
-You know what? I'm fine, okay?

940
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,275
I know what I am, and I'm fine with it.

941
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,737
What? Who are you?

942
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:52,951
I'm the maid that you slept with on vacation.
I'm the great story you tell

943
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,953
when someone asks you
how you learned how to surf.

944
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,961
-You don't trust anybody, do you?
-Can I? Can I trust you?

945
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,964
To do what?

946
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,841
I mean...

947
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:14,306
-What do you want?
-What do I want? Oh, my God.

948
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:18,935
I want

949
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,232
Penny to quit smoking and to go to college.

950
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,984
I want...

951
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,612
I want to be able to pay the phone
and the electricity and the rent

952
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:29,780
all in the same month.

953
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,908
I want a girl
to be on the cover of Surfmagazine,

954
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:37,954
and that would be great if that girl were me,
but any girl would do. And I want...

955
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,334
I mean,
I wish my mom would come home.

956
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:47,839
And I really, really want
to win Pipe Masters tomorrow.

957
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,219
-That's what I want.
-Well, do it.

958
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:59,768
Matt, you don't understand, okay? Pipe...
Pipe is the heaviest wave in the world, okay?

959
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,105
You don't just get worked there. You die.

960
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,689
People die there.

961
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,947
And what happens when I just paddle out
and I don't take off in a single wave?

962
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,699
'Cause I don't care
if I make a fool out of myself,

963
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,119
but I do not want to embarrass my family,

964
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,455
and that's what Lena and Eden
and Penny are. They're my family.

965
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:29,214
Just tell me what to do, please.

966
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:32,759
-You want me to tell you what to do?
-Yes.

967
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:36,054
-You know what to do.
-No, Matt. I honestly don't.

968
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,476
Just be the girl I met on the beach.

969
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:44,229
Who? Who was she?

970
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:48,400
The girl who'd never ask a guy what to do.

971
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,159
Good morning, everybody.
Welcome to the Pipe Masters

972
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,995
here at Banzai Pipeline,
on the North Shore of Oahu.

973
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,664
You're gonna be watching
women's surfing history today,

974
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,584
as these girls take on
the deadliest waves in the world.

975
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,545
Imagine the Niagara Falls
dumping into two feet of water

976
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:12,799
over hard-rock lava with razor-sharp reef
and underwater caves.

977
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:15,302
It’s gonna be a macking 20 feet,

978
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:19,639
so good luck to all the ladies
competing today at the Pipe Masters.

979
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,516
They may be the best in the world,

980
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,560
but they're gonna have
their hands full today.

981
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,937
If you're going down to watch,
it's not a day for a dip in the water.

982
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,982
-Anne Marie. You all right?
-Mmm-hmm.

983
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:35,197
You guys get out here.
I'll go find some parking.

984
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,240
Pretty much
an impossible score at this point.

985
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:40,744
She's way behind, but she's still
gonna try to put it on the line.

986
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:42,370
Looks like she's going for this one.

987
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:45,790
Oh, and she broke her board.

988
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:49,628
You know, any day at Pipeline is critical,
but today,

989
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:53,840
one false move,
and the consequences could be disastrous.

990
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:58,428
More surfers have died here
than any other spot on the planet combined.

991
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,890
This is the first time the girls
have gotten to compete at Pipeline.

992
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,518
The entire surf media's here today.
Every sponsor, talent scout,

993
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:09,522
the entire surf media,
looking to find the next surf sensation.

994
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:13,401
You get one good ride here today,
and you'll put yourself on the surfing map.

995
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,946
So out there by herself is Lynette MacKenzie,

996
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,240
now that Megan's on the beach
with a broken board.

997
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,951
She's in a nice one. She's coming in.

998
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,749
You really have to commit out here
in order to get the wave.

999
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,794
But I'm sure it'll better the score
she already has...

1000
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,545
-Thanks, Cara.
-Good luck, Layne.

1001
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,588
Thanks. I could use it.

1002
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,257
I'm here for the competition.

1003
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,717
-Are you a volunteer?
-She's a competitor.

1004
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,094
Okay, you need to sign this release form.

1005
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:46,268
"In case of death or dismemberment?"

1006
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:49,396
Thank you.
You'll be in heat four with Kate Skarratt.

1007
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,314
You can go ahead and wait
in the competitor's area.

1008
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:54,401
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

1009
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,077
Oh, my gosh. There's Kate Skarratt.

1010
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,622
She kills it at Pipe.
And there's Rochelle Ballard.

1011
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,582
She's queen of Backdoor.

1012
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,794
-Oh, my gosh. Layne Beachley...
-I know who they are.

1013
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:17,549
What? I'm... You're good.
I'm just saying they're, like, really good.

1014
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:23,722
Shit!

1015
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:29,436
Hey!

1016
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,813
- What's up?
-What's up, man?

1017
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,982
- What up, girl?
-Where's parking around here?

1018
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,818
Anywhere, I guess. Whatever you can find.

1019
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,195
Looks like
she's going on this one.

1020
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,538
Hey. Hey, Anne Marie. Look what I found.

1021
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:50,332
Hey.

1022
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,169
-Just driving by.
-What's up, surfer girl? Do the damn thing!

1023
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,339
Shit!

1024
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:06,056
Be alert out there.
It's a super-clean, west-northwest swell.

1025
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,601
Pipe and Backdoor are both open.

1026
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,730
Yeah. Just be patient.
Don't get too anxious.

1027
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:17,859
It's four-wave sets with 20-second intervals.
Take your time.

1028
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,821
Don't take the first wave of the set.
Third wave looks the best.

1029
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:26,409
Here comes Kennelly
taking off. Steep drop.

1030
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:29,079
-Takes the bottom turn.
-She's fierce, man.

1031
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,956
She's covered up.

1032
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,752
She makes it out.

1033
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:39,005
I'm way out of my league.

1034
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:43,593
Hey, no worries.
Just go out there and have fun.

1035
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,012
Fun?

1036
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:53,561
Up next from Wollongong,
Australia, we have Kate Skarratt in red.

1037
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:56,022
She's a goofy foot,
which favors her at Pipeline.

1038
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:59,609
Loves charging big waves
and has taken first place at Teahupoo,

1039
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,903
another barreling left-hander in Tahiti.

1040
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,490
Surfing against her, we have wild-card entry
Anne Marie Chadwick,

1041
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:09,577
a formerjunior NSSA champion
who dropped out of the competitive circuit

1042
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:14,582
after a near-drowning incident
at this very spot just three years ago.

1043
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,545
Five, four, three, two, one.

1044
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:58,460
We've got 20-minute heats
today with the top four waves scoring.

1045
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,587
Wave selection is critical.

1046
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,923
If you pick the wrong wave, wipeout,
get caught inside...

1047
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:06,217
Well, the currents are fierce today,

1048
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,219
and you can spend the rest of your heat
just trying to...

1049
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,138
-How's it going?
-Good.

1050
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:13,433
Nice set approaching.
We got good sets out the back.

1051
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,685
We have really good consistency
with the swell today.

1052
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:19,314
It’s on the rise. It’s probably gonna get up
to about 1 5-to-20 feet.

1053
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:23,693
Kate Skarratt's going on this one.
She's paddling. Gets to her feet.

1054
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:26,362
Makes the drop. Solid bottom turn.

1055
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,992
--Look at that pit!

1056
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,244
She's setting her line.
Breezing to make it out.

1057
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,581
Trying to get in the shoulder.

1058
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:42,253
Traveling, traveling... Oh! She didn't quite
get around that last section.

1059
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,549
She'll get some kind of score for it.

1060
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,345
Looks like it's a 4.1
that came out on the board.

1061
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,139
Water patrol’s checking on her.
Looks like she's okay.

1062
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:55,850
She doesn't need a ride.
She's paddling back out.

1063
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:01,648
So, Chadwick all alone by herself out there,
yet to even score a ride.

1064
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,193
-Go, go! Paddle!
-Headed for her first ride.

1065
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,495
-Backs out.
-Shit!

1066
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,919
No way.
She's not gonna get any more like that.

1067
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,046
-What a waste of wave.
-Shoot! She should've gone.

1068
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:28,550
-That would've opened up perfectly.
-Shit!

1069
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,301
-When you're out there all alone...
-You can do it, girl.

1070
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,804
...you can psych yourself out.

1071
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,223
Baby, what are you doing?

1072
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:38,726
Kate Skarratt paddling
into one of the best waves of the day.

1073
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:41,896
Whoa! Look at this wave. It is the bomb.

1074
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:46,609
Oh! A little overextended. Goes down.

1075
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,736
-Getting sucked up and over the falls.

1076
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,419
Hope she's okay out there.

1077
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:05,503
Ooh!

1078
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:09,424
Kate Skarratt down.
Water patrol coming to pick her up.

1079
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,596
Gets her on the sled and out of harm's way.

1080
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,888
Hang on!

1081
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:22,228
Okay, everybody. As the Ski comes up
on the beach, please give them some room.

1082
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:25,481
The water patrol needs some space
to work on Kate Skarratt,

1083
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,442
who's gone down on that last wave.

1084
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:30,528
They're carrying the backboard down.
This isn't good.

1085
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,323
We need Dr. Leland Dao
to report to the medical tent.

1086
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:37,577
Leland Dao, please report to the medical
tent. We need you down here immediately.

1087
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,633
Charge it!

1088
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,429
-Go.
-Go, go, go!

1089
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,140
Go! Go!

1090
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:11,444
She sets herrail.
Makes the drop. Textbook.

1091
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:16,616
Oh, it's setting up perfectly.
Look at that beautiful wave.

1092
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,872
-She should get a nice score for this one.
-Oh, yes.

1093
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,874
High enough to take her into the next round.

1094
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:29,671
No, no, no.

1095
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,313
Oh, she got so worked.

1096
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:29,772
- I don't see her. Where is she?
- Do you see her?

1097
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:30,982
Man, is she all right?

1098
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,984
-Where is she?
-Come up, Anne Marie. Come up.

1099
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,670
Anne Marie's taking
a heavy beating out there.

1100
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:48,976
Grab my hand!

1101
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:52,980
I got you. Hang on.

1102
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,573
Not that she probably cares
right now, but the judges' score just came in

1103
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,743
and rewarded her a 4.6 for the last ride,

1104
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:09,413
which will move her into the next round
over Skarratt.

1105
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,333
- Anne Marie.
-Are you okay?

1106
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,960
-Is she gonna be okay?
-Yes. Just give us a moment.

1107
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,711
Anne Marie, are you all right?

1108
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:17,880
-Is she gonna be all right?
-Is she gonna be all right?

1109
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:20,758
-She'll be okay. Just give her some
room here. -

1110
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:24,595
-Is she gonna be okay?
-I think so.

1111
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,306
--Ah!

1112
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,937
Gonna put some ice on it.

1113
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,857
Lift your head.

1114
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,945
Just lay there and relax for a minute.

1115
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,285
Hey.

1116
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,872
If you tell me "be the girl on the beach"
right now,

1117
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:53,624
-I'm gonna kick your ass.

1118
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,088
-So how are you feeling?
-I've been better.

1119
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,924
Yeah.

1120
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:08,890
My first NFL game,
I got blindsided by Warren Sapp,

1121
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:12,059
and I'll tell you,
I've never been hit so hard in my life.

1122
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,103
I just lay there,
praying that something was broken

1123
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,605
so I wouldn't have to get up
and finish the game.

1124
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,899
You think I'm faking it right now?

1125
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:21,193
No, I know you got rocked out there,
just like I did.

1126
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:26,324
But Leslie sat me down and said that
that was the hardest I'd ever be hit

1127
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:31,746
and that I would regret not going back in.
So, I went back in.

1128
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,790
And you won the game.

1129
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,335
No, actually, we lost,

1130
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,880
and I got my ass kicked.

1131
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,802
But there was this one beautiful pass,

1132
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:51,098
one perfect spiral
right into Omar's fingertips,

1133
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,767
and a touchdown.

1134
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,357
Look, I can't talk you
into going back out there.

1135
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:01,734
It seems crazy.

1136
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:09,033
But I know how good you are,
and I know how much this means to you.

1137
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:13,245
I just don't want you to spend your life
wondering what could've been.

1138
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,506
Heads up on the beach, people.
Big set approaching.

1139
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,008
Hey, everybody, we have a set out the back.

1140
01:28:26,093 --> 01:28:31,180
Watch your kids, watch your belongings.
The water is coming over the berm.

1141
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,475
It’s dangerous out there. The water patrol
already has their hands full,

1142
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,852
so we'd appreciate it if you'd just back up.

1143
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,188
Here, today, we have a rising swell,

1144
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:42,358
so I wanted to give a little word of warning
to everybody.

1145
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,237
-Guys, look, this is really not a good time.
-Can we get a picture?

1146
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,655
-What?
-Can we get a picture?

1147
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,115
See, we're working these chicks over here.

1148
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,283
They think you're some great hockey player
or something like that.

1149
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,702
-You're kidding.
-No joke, man.

1150
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,746
I want to get this thing done.
Here you go, Kala.

1151
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,581
Sorry, my pits stink,
but that's just the way it goes.

1152
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,542
- Okay, let's go. Right here.

1153
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,836
-Smile. You're on vacation. Over here.
-This way.

1154
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,839
Fluff your bangs up a little bit.
Just a little bit more attitude in there.

1155
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,007
-Beautiful.
-All right. Great.

1156
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,091
One more, one more. Come on.

1157
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,843
-Hey.
-Hi.

1158
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:11,429
-You going back out there?
-Yep.

1159
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,390
It's just a stupid contest.
Not worth getting hurt over.

1160
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:15,850
-I'll be fine.
-Hey.

1161
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,644
-What?
-Be careful.

1162
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,523
Yeah.

1163
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:26,152
That sounds
the start of the next heat.

1164
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,738
So, Chadwick's pretty much
got her hands full with this next round.

1165
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,907
We have Keala Kennelly from Kauai.
She's a charger.

1166
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:35,578
She goes on anything.
And she goes like the men out here.

1167
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,753
There's a bit of a paddle battle
going on out there.

1168
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:47,298
Looks like Chadwick and Kennelly
are just paddling for the peak.

1169
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,884
Chadwick's got the inside position
as a big set approaches.

1170
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,053
-Looks like she's gonna get the first wave.
-Come on. Come on.

1171
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,222
This paddle battle is really about
who's gonna get the first wave.

1172
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:57,475
Chadwick in position.
Heading for the first wave.

1173
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,477
Starts to paddle. She's going for it.

1174
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,107
Oh, she pulls back.
Kennelly's wide open. She catches the wave.

1175
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:12,740
God! Time and time again, man.

1176
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:34,220
She's out,
making it look so easy.

1177
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:38,390
But, folks, it's not easy out there.
Chadwick's starting to paddle.

1178
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,645
She paddles for it. Doesn't quite get it.

1179
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,650
What a waste of wave.

1180
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,074
That's gotta hurt,
when you know you need a score,

1181
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:57,618
and you're going up against
one of the best surfers in this event,

1182
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,829
and you don't go.

1183
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:04,250
Plenty of time being allowed here
for Kennelly to get back in position,

1184
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:09,421
and she's paddled right inside of Chadwick,
and she's looking to catch her next wave.

1185
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,778
Keala Kennelly.
Hands together, ladies and gentlemen.

1186
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:35,656
Keala Kennelly.
A great tube ride out here at the Pipeline.

1187
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,783
-Keala's pretty much got sack.

1188
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:39,368
She goes like the men out here.

1189
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:41,996
For some reason,
Chadwick has yet to even ride a wave.

1190
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,372
I don't know what's going on out there.

1191
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:44,915
I don't know
if she's just psyching herself out

1192
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,917
or if Keala's just putting it to her.

1193
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:55,593
-What are you doing?
-What?

1194
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,470
You gonna take a wave,
or are you just gonna sit there like a buoy?

1195
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:01,557
Look, you're never gonna catch a wave
sitting all the way over here in the channel.

1196
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,976
Why don't you follow me over to the peak,
actually get you into one.

1197
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:08,397
Give the crowd something to cheer about.
Let's get you a wave. Come on.

1198
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:14,570
All right, follow me into the line-up,
and I'm gonna tell you to go on a wave.

1199
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:18,032
And when I tell you to go, you gotta go.
You gotta paddle your little heart out.

1200
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:22,119
You can't hesitate. You can't pull back.
You can't hold back. No fear, all right?

1201
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:25,247
Because if you hold back for a second,
you're gonna eat shit.

1202
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:27,208
So, come on. Follow me.

1203
01:32:33,632 --> 01:32:35,466
It looks like
the next set's approaching.

1204
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,928
Right. This is the one. Go!

1205
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:42,640
Paddle, paddle! Go, girl! Paddle! Paddle!
Go! Paddle!

1206
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,101
Yeah!

1207
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,853
Whoo! Go!

1208
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,496
-Oh, my God!

1209
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,023
-You all right?
-I'm okay. I'm okay!

1210
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:35,150
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1211
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:37,403
Get back out there, then.

1212
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,827
With only two minutes
left in her heat,

1213
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,954
Chadwick struggles to get back
into the line-up

1214
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,914
so she can catch this one wave.

1215
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:52,918
Chadwick yet to even score a good ride,
a scoring ride.

1216
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:56,964
She needs to redeem herself here.
Keala is absolutely dominating this heat,

1217
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,383
and Chadwick needs to collect a scoring ride
on this one.

1218
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,064
Ouch. You all right?

1219
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,608
-That was nasty.
-It's okay. I want another one.

1220
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:18,152
-You want another one?
-Yep.

1221
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,571
That's the spirit!
Shake off that last wave and let's do this.

1222
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,198
-Less than 20 seconds remaining...
-Feel that adrenaline in you? Use it.

1223
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,450
...Anne Marie Chadwick only has
one more chance.

1224
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,410
Paddle, girl.

1225
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,583
On the outside, here comes one of
the best sets of the whole day coming in.

1226
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,252
We have lines stacked to the horizon.

1227
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:42,468
Here comes the set.

1228
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:47,598
This is the one. This is the one, right here.
All right. Come on. Go! Come on. Go! Go!

1229
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,685
Come on, girl. Go!

1230
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,520
-Paddle hard! Paddle hard!
-Go! Go!

1231
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:57,691
-Go! Go! Go!
- Yeah. This is yours! Don't pull back!

1232
01:34:57,776 --> 01:35:00,736
-Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go!

1233
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:58,085
Yeah!

1234
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:00,587
Whoo!

1235
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:01,672
Yeah!

1236
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:03,924
Whoo!

1237
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:07,636
-She makes it!
-That's my bitch!

1238
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,859
That was insane!

1239
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,490
Whoo!

1240
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:31,243
Waiting on the judges' scores.
They're coming in.

1241
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:34,121
Looks like unanimous 10s across the board.

1242
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,748
Not enough to overtake Kennelly
and move into the next round,

1243
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,959
but she is a hero with the crowd here today.

1244
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,879
That's my sister! Whoo!

1245
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,131
That's my sister!

1246
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,383
Just words don't explain it.

1247
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,344
For Anne Marie Chadwick
to get a ride like that

1248
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:52,890
with the entire North Shore
surf community watching...

1249
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:01,607
-That was insane!
-Yeah!

1250
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:04,526
I'm so proud of her.

1251
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:12,618
-Can I have your autograph?
-That was insane.

1252
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:15,662
She's my bitch.
I taught her everything she knows.

1253
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:18,248
- What's your name?
-That's right. That's our girl.

1254
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,335
Hey.

1255
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:25,255
-That was awesome.
-Thank you.

1256
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,257
Hey, you should check out the boards.

1257
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,512
-Hey, Anne Marie.
-Hi.

1258
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,722
Excuse me, Anne Marie.
I'm Jessica from Billabong.

1259
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,098
I'd love to talk to you
about being on our team.

1260
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,601
-Wait your turn, honey.
-Okay.

1261
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,604
-Does she know she got beat?
-Nice, isn't it?

1262
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:43,398
Hey.

1263
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:51,406
-You did the damn thing, girl.
-Thanks.

1264
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:52,908
Thank you.

1265
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:56,078
You were so amazing.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1266
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:58,747
-Yes.
-Oh, that was insane.

1267
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,707
But I still think you owe me
a few surf lessons.

1268
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:02,209
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1269
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,710
You want to go out there?

1270
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:09,466
Only if you're gentle.

1271
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:12,386
Not a chance.
