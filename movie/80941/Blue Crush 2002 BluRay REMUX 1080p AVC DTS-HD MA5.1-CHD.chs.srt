1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,243
蓝色激情 / 碧海娇娃

2
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,923
我想要成为世界上最棒的冲浪者
I'm gonna be
the best surfer in the world.

3
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,820
我才会是世界上最棒的冲浪者呢
I'm gonna be
the best surfer in the world, not you.

4
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,866
她从那边出场了
看那海浪
She's just sliding in there.
Look at that wave.

5
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,827
安妮玛丽 查德威克
乘着今天最棒的海浪
Anne Marie Chadwick
getting the best wave of the day.

6
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,509
安妮玛丽，我走了
Anne Marie, I’m leaving you!

7
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,433
我是“好热的”浪头骇客
今天是二月三日 星期三
Hey, Howzit, wave riders?
It's hump day. Wednesday, February 3rd.

8
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,353
平均浪高14尺
Waves are averaging 14 feet in 18 seconds,

9
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,357
海面上一定有好东西 让我们出发吧
so there's definitely some size out there
in the water, and it's moving our way.

10
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,317
现在外面有点令人发晨呕
There's a little bit of morning sickness
out right now,

11
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,320
但风速提高后应该就会清爽了--
but it should clean up as the winds pick up.

12
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,512
风平浪静
It's flat.

13
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,222
是啊 我正看着
Yeah, right.
I’m looking at it.

14
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,933
安妮玛丽？
怎么了，杰杰？
-Anne Marie?
-What's up, JJ?

15
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,228
告诉伊登 她是大热门
Tell Eden she's a hottie. Hook me up.

16
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,189
你自己告诉她吧
潮汐看来如何？
Tell her yourself. How's Pipe looking?

17
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,902
哇！大浪突然起来了
至少有两个人高
Whoa! It's going off!
It's at least double overhead.

18
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,278
你最好过来
You better get down here.

19
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,362
哦 谢谢，杰杰
Okay. Thanks, JJ.

20
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,159
潘 起来 快起来 潘妮 快起来
唔
-Pen. Pen, come on. Get up. Penny. Get up.
-Mmm.

21
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,912
两个人高的大浪
It's double overhead.

22
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,970
他会爱你吗
& could you be loved &

23
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,794
会爱你吗
莉娜 嘿，莉娜 什么
&And be loved &
-Lena. Hey, Lena. -What?

24
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,450
两个人高的大浪
-什么？
-It's double overhead.
-What?

25
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,940
他会爱你吗
& could you be loved &

26
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,720
会爱你吗
& And be loved &

27
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,681
进行的如何？
How's it coming?

28
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,143
我无法将这铁条弄直 因为太细了
I can't get the rails right.
They're too pinched.

29
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,772
想要下水吗？
下水前我通常先用用望远镜望望
-You want to get wet?
-I gotta glass before work.

30
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,398
现在海浪正棒呢
It's perfect Pipe.

31
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,569
真的吗？
真的
-For real?
-For real.

32
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,738
走吧
好， 走吧
Let's go!
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

33
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,366
走吧 出发罗
走咯
Get a move on. Let's go.
Let's go!

34
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,577
哦，可以了 走吧
Okay, got my noodles. Let's go.

35
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,591
快加速
Turn it up.

36
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,468
他会爱你吗
& could you be loved &

37
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,847
会爱你吗
喔！
& And be loved &
Whoo-hoo!

38
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,100
浪来了！
It's going off!

39
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,540
他会爱你吗
& could you be loved &

40
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,310
会爱你吗
& And be loved &

41
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,241
怎么了，兄弟？
What's up, bro?

42
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,329
太棒了 大老鼠来了
Great. The Rat Pack's here.

43
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,373
呕
看，凯豪和布雷登来了
It's gonna be sick.
Look, Kehau and Braden are going.

44
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,582
嘿，怎样，家伙们？
You know it's gonna be sick.

45
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,917
嘿，小子，这是怎么？
嘿，艾可，如何？
-Hey. What's up, guys?
-Hey, Rico, what's up?

46
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,002
嘿，女孩们
Hey, girls.

47
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,086
还好吗？怎么才来呀？兄弟们
What's up? How you living, man?

48
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,671
我们该早一个小时来的
We should have been here
at least an hour ago.

49
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,966
若你们早点起来就好了
我们还好啊
If you guys had gotten moving,
maybe we would've been.

50
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,593
怎样， 塔马约？
嘿，女孩们 如何？
-What's up, Tamayo?
-Hey. How's it, girls?

51
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,221
海面上如何？ 
How is it out there?

52
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,849
喔，我靠 冲浪板都打坏了
Oh, It's pretty nuts. Broke my board.

53
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:55,354
海面上狂风巨浪的
你们真的有考虑清楚？
It's pretty heavy out there.
Your girl got her head on straight this time?

54
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,858
有吗？
你也知道的
-Does she?
-You know it.

55
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,217
噢，看看谁来了
你们来做什么？
-Oh, look who's here.
-Hey, what are you girls doing here?

56
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,053
当然是冲浪 
Same thing you are. We came to surf Pipe.

57
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,971
你们何不泡泡妞就算了？
Why don't you check out girlie bowls
or something?

58
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,848
那你何不回到你的洞里去？
Why don't you crawl back
into the cave you came from?

59
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,141
那我何不敲昏你们的头，
Why don't I knock you over the head

60
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,517
拖你们跟我一起下水？唔？
and drag you in there with me, huh?

61
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:37,646
正想试试
我最喜欢外强内柔的女孩了
-You just try that.
-I like girls that are rough and soft inside.

62
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,065
女孩 嫁给我吧 
I'm gonna bury you, girl.

63
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,234
放了她 说真的 放开她
我们要走了
Let her go. Seriously, let her go.
We're out of here.

64
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,278
听说你要参加冲浪名人赛？
So, what's this I hear
about you surfing the Pipe Masters?

65
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,404
那是冲浪比赛
It's a surfing contest,

66
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,989
不是溺水比赛
not a drowning contest.

67
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,909
嘿，别再骚扰她了
她会成功的 
Hey, why don't you stop hassling my girl?
She's gonna dominate.

68
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,453
我正等着瞧啊
我不介意能掌握海浪的女孩
Let's see it.
I don't mind girls that can charge Pipe.

69
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,623
小女孩认为她能掌握海浪
真是酷啊 她真的行吗？
Chick thinks she can charge Pipe. That's
cool. You think she can surf it for real?

70
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,041
你真的以为你行吗？
What, you think you can surf it for real?

71
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,251
德鲁 从现在起，什么我都能做，唔？
Well, I dated you, Drew.
I guess I can do anything, huh?

72
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,422
等着瞧 我去跟我的男伴们会合了
你们要的浪 我们都会将之阻断
Let's see it. I'll get my boys out there.
We'll block every single wave you want.

73
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,675
不论浪多大都一样 让我们走着瞧吧
No matter how big it is, we want you on it.
Let's see what's gonna happen.

74
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,968
来啊 
Let's do it.

75
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,553
别光说不练 做来瞧瞧
Don't talk bubbles to me. Let's see it.

76
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,108
7:45 在浴室会合？
哦！
-So, meet us at the shower at 7:45?
-Okay.

77
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,984
尽量别滑出去太远 
哦
-And stay on the inside.
-Okay.

78
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,236
小心点 潘
好啦
-Be careful, Pen.
-All right.

79
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,921
喔 看起来好像连礁石都要碎了
Looks like the reef's breaking down.

80
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,969
喔，他被浪打倒了
Ooh, he got shut down.

81
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,226
喔！
浪头真猛 真可怕
-Ooh!
-It's heavy out there.

82
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,061
浪太大了
It's fierce.

83
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,071
喔！喔，他撞到礁石了
He hit the reef.

84
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,783
会受伤的
That's gotta hurt.

85
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:18,247
我们还是从沙洲这边开始好了
I think we should start at the sandbar
and work our way over.

86
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,040
我同意
I won't argue with that.

87
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,270
酷夏好难受
& Now we all know summertime is a bummer with no duckets &

88
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,140
生活多奔波
& Honeys want money Exposed like their tummy is &

89
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,770
忙里来偷闲 
& The one time you can just sit right there &

90
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,900
日子总要过
& No way you can't feel it &

91
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,950
世人需振作
& They're coming up skimpy with the coverup &

92
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,210
笑语加欢歌
& I got a long joint for ya MBug cover song &

93
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,610
天热阳光好
& Do what summer does and Shine &

94
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,550
景美天亦高
& Bright like the view of the sky inside the pipeline &

95
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,920
酷夏烦恼多
& It's a cruel, cruel summer, It's a cruel &

96
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,290
快快离开我
& Leaving me here on my own &

97
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,079
酷夏烦恼多
& It's a cruel, cruel summer, It's a cruel &

98
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,079
呼
Whoo!

99
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,470
现在消失了
& Now you've gone & 

100
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,510
沙滩捡到宝
& So we're walking across the beach Bumpin'MBug tunes &

101
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,174
简直乐坏她
& when we spot three lovely jewels, sweet ladies having a bad day &

102
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,174
呼
Whoo!

103
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,280
当着我的面
拼命将我夸
& They looked at me with sad faces & 
& Every day they'd say to me &

104
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,480
路面似烤炉
& Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning &

105
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,350
热浪围着我
& I sit around &

106
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,150
夏天有欢乐
烦恼也多多
& I said you got to be kidding baby &
& summer is the joint whatcha thinking &

107
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,320
我想笑一笑 空气似火烧
& Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry &

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,020
我想骂一骂 力气也没有
& I don't give a f-Need a new rush &

109
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,860
来点新创意
& Let me get a hold and slap back with the new stuff &

110
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,130
我们来K歌
& Strange voices are saying Strange voices &

111
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
随便怎么唱 不论唱什么
& what did they say Things I can't understand what did I say &

112
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,500
唱到坏运消
& Tough luck It's too close for comfort &

113
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,810
唱到热浪走
& This heat has got right out of hand &

114
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,540
一起冲浪吧 日子更好过
& So the Bleste grabbed 'em dragged 'em to the sea splashed 'em in &

115
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,048
酷夏烦恼多
& And that's it &  & It's a cruel, cruel summer &

116
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,131
呼
Whoo!

117
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,889
现在消失了
& Now you've gone &

118
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,015
我想要有艘船能环岛 
I want to get a boat so we can, like,
go around the island

119
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,600
找到一些秘密点
and get some killer secret spots.

120
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,769
保证一定有很多
喔，天啊 我知道
-Guaranteed, there's so many.
-God, I know. I know.

121
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,606
嘿！
你们躲在沙洲这干嘛？
Hey!
What's this horseshit on-the-sandbar crap?

122
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,191
在沙洲这里冲浪 是不可能赢得名人赛的
You're not gonna win the Masters
surfing the sandbar.

123
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,028
在海边时还夸口说
“德鲁 从现在起，我什么都能做”
Talking all this crap on the beach, like,
"I dated you, Drew. I can do anything."

124
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,863
这哪算是浪啊  真的浪在那里 
This isn't Pipe. Pipe's over there.

125
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,409
走吧 真的浪在那里
男孩们会在前面替你们挡的
Let's go! Pipe's over there.
The boys are gonna block for you.

126
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,288
走吧 好啊 快
Let's do this. Let's go. Come on.

127
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,671
呜！ 剑
Whoo! Yeah!

128
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,104
兄弟们 走吧
Let's go, man.

129
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,107
坐而言不如起而行
Actions speak louder than words.

130
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,403
这景象好熟悉
什么，我的一部分要离开了？
-Now, that's the view I remember.
-What, the one of me leaving?

131
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,071
这也是我的最爱
It's my favorite, too.

132
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,163
来啊 就这个浪
Come on. Pick it up.

133
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,669
喜欢吗？下个浪就是你的
Like that wave, huh? Next one's yours.

134
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,354
欢迎来到阿瑞娜，女孩
让你试试真正的大浪
Welcome to the arena, girl.
Let's get you into something big.

135
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,855
安妮玛丽 你去哪儿了？
What's up, Anne Marie?
Where you been?

136
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,148
我以为你在我们之后
I thought you were right behind us.

137
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,734
今天是你的大日子 来吧
Today's your big day. Let's do it.

138
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,862
嗨，大伙们 她是安妮玛丽
她要跟男孩们
Right. Hey, everybody. This is my girl,
Anne Marie. She's with the boys.

139
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,988
一起冲浪
She's gonna get some waves out here.

140
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,907
只要你挡到她 就等着瞧
Any of you get in her way,
you're gonna have to deal with me.

141
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,700
走吧 快用力划！
Come on. Let's go.
Here it comes. Come on.

142
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,743
快用力划！！ 
Paddle, paddle!

143
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,119
快！用力划！！
Hurry up. Come on!

144
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,664
小心！ 小心！春天女郎的浪！
Watch out, watch out! Spring girl's wave.

145
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,504
快！ 快用力划！！
Go, Anne Marie! Paddle in!

146
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,422
快！ 快用力划！
快用力划！ 用力划！
Come on!
Paddle! Paddle! Paddle!

147
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,306
怎么一回事？
What the hell was that?

148
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,977
-天啊！
God!

149
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,439
你根本没有划！
-女孩哪会冲浪
-You ain't even paddling.
-Girls can't surf Pipe.

150
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,565
怎么了？
What the hell was that?

151
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,693
她在怕什么？
What the hell is she afraid of?

152
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,411
这不是选美比赛 
喔，若你再这样 就会被拒绝在外
This ain't a beauty pageant.
You do that again, you're barred.

153
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,372
来吧， 安妮玛丽
这次你得好好干 不是胡言乱语的
Come on, Anne Marie.
You gotta do it this time. No fooling around.

154
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,832
好好干吧
Let's do it.

155
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,425
这个浪就是你的 别搞砸了
否则我不帮你了
This one's yours, right here. Don't blow it,
or I ain't gonna help you anymore.

156
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,137
快 快用力划，用力划！
这个浪是你的  快！ 快！
Come on. Paddle, paddle!
This one's yours now. Go! Go!

157
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,479
喔！
Ooh!

158
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,875
你的位置恰恰好
就是在那里
You were in the perfect spot.
You were right where you needed to be.

159
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,626
又怎样 巨浪就像猛兽般 
Whatever. That thing was a beast.

160
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,879
还是半途退出了
浪有多大？
-Just dropped out of nowhere.
-How big was it?

161
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,755
真是猛
我想有三个人高
It was solid.
It was, like, triple overhead.

162
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,299
她感受到了
哇
She had that.
Wow.

163
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,550
她完全感受到了
She totally had it.

164
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,969
只差再多用力划而已
Yeah, she just needed
to paddle a little harder.

165
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,345
我不知道
I don't know.

166
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,349
全都在你脑子里
It's all in your
head. It's all up here.

167
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,226
我告诉你
若是你没犯错， 
I'm telling you,
if you just would have committed,

168
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,895
应该可以成功的冲上去
you could have made that wave.

169
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,230
不管怎样  至少她试过了
那个浪如此大
Whatever. At least she went.
That wave was huge.

170
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,523
我就不敢去 
I wouldn't have gone.

171
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,816
她的位置真好
She was perfectly positioned
on the wave.

172
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,320
为什么太阳从东方升起？
如果她有本事-
Why does the sun rise in the east? 
If she had the balls to really charge it...

173
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,489
什么？
为什么太阳从东方升起？
-What?
-Hey, why does the sun rise in the east?

174
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,826
因为它从西方落下
因为地球自转的关系
-'Cause it sets in the west.
-Because that's the way the Earth rotates.

175
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,537
记得超人里面有一集
You remember that Supeman episode

176
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,291
超人将地球倒转
where he was, like,
spinning around the Earth backwards,

177
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,002
将地球往反方向转？
trying to rotate it in the other direction?

178
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,962
是啊 是啊
然后将时间回转到过去？
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-To bring back time?

179
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,339
潘妮，我以为你作业完成了
Penny, I thought you finished
your homework.

180
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,174
没错 只是在确认一下
I did. I'm just checking it.

181
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,634
看起来没完 
It doesn't look like
you're finished.

182
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,010
吉芝 别再烦她了
Geez, stop picking on her, dude.

183
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,053
她快要完成了
She's getting it done now.

184
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,137
我们才在往学校的路上 
Yeah,
we're on our way to school.

185
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,263
我完成了
No, I finished it.

186
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,681
她昨晚就完成了
She should've
had it done by last night.

187
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,849
只是在确认一下
I'm checking it.

188
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,727
她只是在确认一下 
昨晚就完成了 只是在确认一下
She's just checking it.
I did it last night. I'm checking it.

189
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,066
潘妮！ 潘妮！
什么事？
-Penny! Penny!
-What?

190
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,150
脚蹼
Slippers.

191
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,945
别偷懒逃避 
No ditching.

192
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,154
噢
Okay.

193
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,033
失败了要怪你
好啦
-It sucks to be you! 
-Yeah, it does.

194
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,869
亲爱的 总有人要上大学去
但不是我
Someone's gotta go to college, honey.
Not me.

195
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,955
喔，不！阿久井老师来了
Shit. It's Mr. Pukui.

196
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,082
记得他裤子上总是有尿痕？
Remember how he used to have pee stains
all the time?

197
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,125
看来他已经知道小便完如何摇了
Looks like he learned
how to shake right.

198
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,460
嗨，阿久井老师
安妮玛丽
-Hi, Mr. Pukui.
-Anne Marie,

199
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,880
这已经是你妹妹这个月第八次迟到了
this is the eighth time
your sister's been tardy in the last month.

200
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,799
我知道  塞车-
若你认为冲浪
-I know, traffic...
-If you think surfing

201
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,510
比上学更重要
我们得要做其他的安排了
is more important than school,
we gotta make other arrangements.

202
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,594
你知道吗，阿久井老师
You know what, Mr. Pukui?

203
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,473
我能想到的安排就是我母亲
The only other arrangement
I can think of right now is my mother,

204
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,934
然而她正好在拉斯维加斯
跟她最近一任饭票在一起
and she just so happens to be
with her latest meal ticket in Vegas,

205
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,896
而他又嫌我们这些拖油瓶  你懂吗？
who apparently isn't so cool
with the kid's menu, you know what I mean?

206
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,482
所以，这是我现在能做的
So, right now,
this is the best arrangement I can do.

207
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,485
你知道，潘妮是个聪明的女孩
没错
-You know, Penny's a smart girl.
-Yeah, she is.

208
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,948
就像他姊姊过去一样
现在 用现在式
-Just like her sister was.
-Is. Present tense.

209
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,742
我在这读书时学到了许多
I learned that much while I was here.

210
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,744
女孩们 最好注意一点
You'd better watch it, girl.

211
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,081
我正尽力去做
我也只能这样说了
You know, I'm doing the best I can do.
That's all I can say.

212
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,833
你可以做得更好
You can do better.

213
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,253
天啊！
God!

214
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,922
他非常适合穿那夏威夷衬衫 
He's so ripping in that aloha shirt anyway.

215
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,674
我觉得他很辣
I thought he was hot.

216
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,011
你七年级时曾是高峰期
莉娜 闭嘴
-You did kind of peak in seventh grade.
-Shut up, Lena.

217
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,263
她是说性的高峰期
对了
-Sexually, she means.
-All right.

218
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,974
这像是什么，困住了安妮玛丽？
What is this, like, bag on Anne Marie?

219
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
呜！
Whoo!

220
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,231
17.53 元
夏威夷币吗？
-$1 7.53.
-That's kamaaina price?

221
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,774
是美金 喔
No kamaaina for candy.

222
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,485
莉拉尼，只是早餐而已
是啊
-Aw! Come on, Leilani. It's breakfast.
-Yeah.

223
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,114
早餐？抱歉 女孩们 $17.53元
里面有玉米糖浆
-Breakfast? Right. Sorry, girls. $17.53.
-This has corn syrup in it.

224
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,866
那是蔬菜
很营养
-It's a vegetable.
-It's nutritional.

225
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,327
不，我不这样认为
它含有糖份  能转化成脂肪
No, I don't think so.
It has sugar. Turns into fat,

226
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,995
然后胖得像我一样 喔？
and fat comes out like me, okay?

227
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,790
这样，$17.53元
好吧  我有五元
-So, $17.53.
-All right. I've got $5.

228
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,459
我有一些
你呢？ 
-I got some on me.
-How much do you have?

229
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,836
我有些现金
慢着， 我好像有-
-Yeah, I got some cash.
-Hold on, I got like...

230
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,467
这是什么？
我不知道， 好像是70.60分--
-What is this?
-I don't know, like, 70, 60...

231
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,968
真可悲 什么东西？
That's pathetic. What is that?

232
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,347
我没说我有很多 我有一些
I don't know. I didn't say I had a
lot of cash. I just said I had some.

233
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,641
我昨天给你的五元呢？
What happened
to the five bucks I gave you yesterday?

234
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,851
我帮萨米买食物
它又不是我们的狗，莉娜
-I bought food for Sammi.
-It's not even our dog, Lena.

235
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,978
狗儿要吃东西
我也是 我好饿
-Dog's gotta eat.
-Well, so do I. I'm hungry.

236
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,856
把剩下的小餐包吃了
我不要 我要吃早餐
-Eat the rest of this Twinkie.
-I don't want a Twinkie. I want breakfast.

237
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
小餐包就是早餐
Twinkie is breakfast.

238
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,654
那是 克阿拉 肯内利
她真是有名
It's Keala Kennelly. She's living the life.

239
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,614
一定是来参加比赛的 
She must be here for the contest.

240
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,283
看他的冲浪板
多么精致 
-Check those Jet Skis out.
-So fun.

241
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,077
好吧， 我们将它们加满油吧
All right, let's fill these bad boys up.

242
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,288
快啊 今天会很忙碌的
她跟“绿洲”的赞助商一起  
-It's gonna be a busy day.
-She's with her Billabong sponsor.

243
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,123
快去自我介绍啊
我不
-You should go introduce yourself.
-No.

244
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,667
为什么不？ 
太奇怪了
-Why not?
-Because it's weird.

245
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,793
没什么好怕的 去吧
It's not weird. You can go.

246
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,252
快啊
不
-Yes.
-No.

247
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,339
嗨 能帮我们签名吗？
没问题
-Hi, can we have your autograph?
-Yeah, sure.

248
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,132
我帮你拿枝笔
谢谢
-I'll get you a pen.
-Thanks.

249

330
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,462
我们正要收拾这衣物
We're just picking up the
clothes off the floor.

331
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,714
地板上的衣物怎么了？
What happened to all the clothes
that was on the floor?

332
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,633
我们折起来放到床上
We just folded them up
and put them on the bed.

333
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,927
我放在地板上是要你们知道
All right. I left the clothes on the floor
so that you would know

334
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,386
这些衣物需要干洗
that they need to be dry-cleaned.

335
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,097
我们需要有干洗袋
Okay, well, that's actually why we had
the dry-cleaning bags,

336
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,849
这也就是原因了
for that specific purpose.

337
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,018
为何你们不将之放入袋里？
Well, then,
why don't you put them in the bag?

338
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,687
没问题
这胸罩好可爱
-No problem.
-That's a cute top.

339
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:16,316
我需要你们将我的脏衣服放入袋中
"Like, I need for you guys to put
all of my crusty clothes inside of the bag."

340
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
就像将她的乳房放入胸罩中
What about the bags in her boobs?

341
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,319
她的乳房跟我的头一样大

Oh, yeah, I don't think so.
You can go for it, though.

354
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,883
是你在受训，而不是我
You're the one in training, not me.

355
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,428
你闻到了吗？
Do you smell that?

356
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,102
啤酒都不见了
Beer's gone.

You know what? Fine.

376
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,472
很好
Fine!

377
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,103
我们就这样了 音乐开大声一点 
We're over this. Turn the music up.

378
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,438
你还好吗？
You all right?

379
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,041
谢谢你载我
Thanks for the ride.

380
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,239
我应该送她去军校的
You should just send her
to military school.

381
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,533
剃掉她的头发
以此为戒
You should just shave her head.
That ought to send a message.

382
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,994
你们真是伪君子
在她的年纪时 谁不参加舞会啊
You guys are such hypocrites.
We totally partied at her age.

383
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,164
我们没有啊 我们不是14岁时参加
而是12岁时
-We did not. We were not 14.
-More like 12.

384
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,791
那是谁的错？
你们应做我的榜样才是啊
Whose fault is that?
You guys were supposed to be my examples.

385
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,210
喔，什么？
拜托！
-Oh, what?
-Please!

386
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,712
就像我们在你大一时强迫你 
Yeah, like we were the ones
who forced you during freshman year

387
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,174
去爬沃尔康家的排水管
并偷了他们的兰姆酒 
to climb up the rain gutter
at the Volcom House and steal their rum.

388
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,676
喔，妈的
你不记得了？
Shit.
-You remember that?

389
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,054
别担心
我们后来没事 对吗？
Ah, don't worry about it.
I mean, we turned out fine, right?

390
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,890
家务 家务
Housekeeping. Housekeeping.

391
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,688
喔，糟了！
呕 臭死了 那是什么？
-Oh, shit.
-God, that reeks. What is that?

392
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,816
那是什么味道？
我没有- 我什么都没做
-What is that smell?
-I'm not doing this. Uh-uh.

393
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,779
那是什么味道？
真是令人作呕，
-What is that smell?
-Freaking nasty. That's what it is.

394
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,948
整个房间里都充满臭味
真是令人讨厌
-It reeks in this room.
-This really sucks, right here.

395
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,076
喔，老天爷
好吧 我们开始吧
-Oh, my God.
-All right. Let's just get started.

396
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,619
好的
喔，变态！
-All right.
-Ew! Sick!

397
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,829
什么？ 喔！
What?

398
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,544
喔， 老天爷！
喔，老天爷！那--
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God, that...

399
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,463
我不要清理那些
我们还是得工作
-I'm not cleaning that up.
-We have to do it.

400
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,173
我们得做完工作
我不要清理 
-We have to get it done.
-I'm not cleaning that up.

401
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,634
我们还是得做完它
真恶心
-We gotta get it done.
It's just the way it is. -It's so sick.

402
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,011
无颈猪 喔！
莉娜 帮我铺床
-No-neck pigs.
-Help me make the bed, Lena.

403
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,179
啊
Ugh!

404
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,640
足球员真是邋遢
Football players are so nasty.

405
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,433
我不晓得从何着手
I mean,
I don't even know where to start.

406
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,893
他们以为什么事都可以做 
They think
they can get away with anything.

407
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,603
真是荒谬
This is ridiculous.

408
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,855
真恶心
什么？
-Ugh! Sick!
-What?

409
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,941
安妮玛丽 拿开！真恶心！
什么？
-Get it off, Anne Marie! It's stuck!
-What?

410
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,443
别来！
那是什么？
-It's not coming off!
-What? What is it?

411
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,611
避孕套
It's a condom.

412
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,531
真恶心！
不 别摸它！
It's stuck!
No, don't touch it!

413
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,702
拿开！拿开！
拿开！
-Get it off! Get it off!
-Get it off.

414
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,871
戴个手套
喔，拿开！
-Put some gloves on.
-Get it off!

415
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:08,626
放轻松 我拿不到
你他妈的摇来摇去 
Just relax. I can't get it
if you're frigging tossing around.

416
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,712
脏死了
喔 天啊！
That's nasty.
Oh, my God!

417
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:11,963

Ugh!

418
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,300
喔 真恶心！喔！
Oh, sick! Ugh!

419
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,887
你知道吗？ 就这样
You know what? That's it.

420
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,432
喔，婚礼与蜜月在同一地点？
Wedding and honeymoon
in the same place?

421
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,767
女孩们，我很热
走，我们去浮潜吧 
Girls, I'm hot.
Come on. Let's go snorkeling or something.

422
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,812
我不要顶着这头发去浮潜
别逗了
I am not snorkeling with this hair.
Give me a break.

423
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,398
那面具会在脸上留下难看的压痕
I know! Those masks leave the worst marks
on your face.

424
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,859
就像是有上百个人吐痰在上面一样
呜
-There's, like, 100 people's spit in them.
-Ooh!

425
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,861
有人在215房吗？
Anybody in room 215?

426
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:41,159
215房？ 有人在215房吗？有人在215房吗？
215? You ladies in 215? Gentlemen! 215?

427
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,911
有人在215房吗？
Anybody in room 215?

428
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,334
没有？ 有人在215房吗？ 外面的水中？
什么？
-No? Anybody in room 215 out in the water?
-What?

429
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,795
215房？ 是你的吗？
喔
-Suite 215? Is it yours?
-Oh.

430
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,883
喔！ 老天啊！
Oh! God!

431
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,094
跳！
Jump!

432
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,179
我在215 房
I'm in 215.

433
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,973
我对天发誓那是个避孕套
我认为我赢得了什么
-I swear to God, that's a condom.
-I think I won something.

434
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,852
我在215号房  我会赢得什么？
嗨 我是安妮玛丽
-I'm in 215. What'd I win?
-Hi. I'm Anne Marie.

435
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,103
我是你房间的服务员
I'm the housekeeper of your room.

436
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,273
莱斯利 O-线！ O-线！
-Leslie. O-line!
-O-line!

437
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,360
莱斯利 你有时间吗？
当然 随您吩咐
-Do you have a sec, Leslie?
-Sure, take all the time you want.

438
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,444
就算唱曲也行
Sugar wugar.

439
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,528
第一步
Step one.

440
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,197
呃
Ew!

441
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,949
第二步
Step two.

442
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,664
然后第三步 懂了吗？
谢谢你们的时间
And step three. You got it?
Thanks for your time, guys.

443
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,377
没问题
你由女侍教养
-No problem.
-Ooh! You got schooled by the maid, homie.

444
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,754
我正在度假 你不必-  
你很有规矩
-I'm on vacation.
-You still got schooled by the maid.

445
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,714
度假时不用打扫房间
But you don't have to clean your room
when you're on vacation.

446
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,050
你很有规矩 
但是不用打扫房间！
-You got schooled by the maid.
-But you don't have to clean your room

447
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,968
当你在度假的时候
when you're on vacation!

448
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,639
我正放假吗？
I'm on vacation.

449
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,894
真是令人讨厌，真是恶心
It was gross! It was disgusting!

450
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,229
我不管他们做什么
I don't care what they did.

451
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,815
他们是贵宾 收费最高
They are VIP. Pay the highest rate.

452
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,651
他们付的钱还不够叫女侍来教导他们呢
They don't pay good money
to be scolded by a housekeeper.

453
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,862
下周你可以领最后一张支票
安妮玛丽，冲浪季到了
You can pick up your last check next week.
Surf's up, Anne Marie.

454
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,532
他们尿在地板上
窗帘上到处是呕吐物
-They peed on the floor.
-There was puke all over the curtain.

455
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,033
请不要停我职
我们需要这笔钱
Please don't suspend me.
We need the money.

456
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,369
我不是要停你职 我要解雇你
I'm not suspending you. I'm firing you.

457
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,205
什么？
好吧，若她被解雇 我也辞职
-What?
-Well, if she's fired, I quit.

458
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,707
我也是
好吧
-Me, too.
-Fine.

459
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,586
你真的要炒我们鱿鱼？
不，我是解雇你
-You're seriously gonna fire all of us?
-No, I'm firing you.

460
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,424
他们是辞职 所以别想成集中解聘
They quit. So don't get any ideas
about collecting unemployment.

461
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,222
你们别辞职
我们需要租金
You guys, don't quit.
We need to make rent.

462
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,679
你应该可以留在下面更久
You could've stayed down longer than that.

463
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,223
伊登 憋气好难受啊
I'm tired of holding my breath, Eden.

464
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,732
天啊，
她就是爱惹我生气
God,
she just loves pissing me off.

465
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,068
你看她 她不是来冲浪的
她只是来吸引众人目光的
Look at her. She's not even out here to get
waves. She just wants to get attention.

466
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,487
那她在那些家伙之间有何搞头？ 
What does she see in those guys anyway?

467
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,654
他们简直是形容枯槁
They're such burnouts.

468
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,323
你也是一样
什么？
-Same thing you did.
-What?

469
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,949
好一个正冲及回冲浪峰
Cut body and a nice cutback.

470
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,287
喔， 太好了
她的姿态不佳
-She's right.
-She's got a bad attitude.

471
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,874
她的表现不该是这样啊
It's not who she is.

472
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,513
内侧！对啊！我在这！
！
Inside! Got it! I'm on it!

473
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,228
打败它
Beat it!

474
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,398
嘿，嘿，嘿！就这样！
Hey, hey, hey! Got it!

475
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,487
嘿！嘿，你到哪里？
Hey! Where are you going?

476
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,990
我在这！走开！
I'm on it! Get off!

477
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,204
德鲁，我做到了！
Drew, I got it!

478
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,545
嘿！
Hey!

479
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,943
我有这部分 你有何问题？
I had the section. What's your problem?

480
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,404
你该长大了
You need to grow up.

481
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,739
你弄坏了冲浪板并非是我的错
你这笨新手 你真傻
It's not my fault you broke your board,
you stupid kook.

482
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,117
不，你是个疯子
别再闯进来  
No, you're a kook!
Don't ever drop down on me again!

483
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,270
没错
回家吧 打败它
Yeah, that's right.
Go home. Beat it, blondie.

484
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,260
猴子
Donkey.

485
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,639
你可否将它黏回去？
不
-Can you glue it back together?
-No.

486
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,601
好吧，我只是开车经过而已
喔
-I was just driving by.
-Okay.

487
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,355
嗯，事实上，是旅馆的人告诉我可以来找你
Well, actually, the guy at the hotel
told me where I could find you.

488
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,568
你知道 冲浪相当的可怕
So, that's pretty awesome,
you know. Surfing.

489
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,486
对
嘿，听着
-Right.
-Hey, listen,

490
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:32,366
我要为我朋友在旅馆的事道歉
I wanted to apologize
for my friend back at the hotel.

491
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,662
莱斯利平常可能不修边幅，但当朋友有难
You know, Leslie's kind of messy, but when
your ass is hanging out in the pocket,

492
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,123
他总是会挺身而出
he's the guy you want
protecting your backside.

493
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:44,170
所以当你有需要时 可以求教于他
So, next time your ass is hanging back
in the pocket, he's your guy.

494
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,715
我会记得的
怎么了 安妮玛丽？
-I'll remember that.
-Hey, what's up, Anne Marie?

495
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,176
嘿，本
你弄坏了冲浪板 真是糟透了
-Hey, Ben. How're you doing?
-You broke your board? That sucks.

496
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,178

我敢说你当时一定是猛冲
-Yeah.
-Bet you were charging, though.

497

嘿，我认识你吗？
-Something like that.

Um, anyway, I was wondering
if maybe you've taught anybody.

503

That's nice.
-Well, I'd love to learn.

506
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,583
你说得倒简单

-It's not easy.
-I know, but it looks really fun out there.

507
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,127
你会受伤
我很确定我会照顾自己
-You can get hurt.
-I'm sure I could handle myself.

508
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,004
这小子是里克 
You know what? There's this guy Rick.

509

他会带你用海绵冲浪板玩些小浪
He'll set you up with a sponge board
and some baby waves.

510
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,510
他很温柔
你呢？
-He's gentle.
-And you are?

511
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,262
我不温柔
对
-Not.
-Right.

512
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,266

517
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,404
学习？钱呢？我们早破产了？ 
Lessons? Money? We're broke?

518
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,949
他没提到钱
那你问了吗？
-Well, he didn't say anything about paying.

00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,990
每小时二十元
二十元？
-Twenty bucks an hour.
-$20?

531
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,953
太贵了吗？
十五块啦？
-Too much?
-$15?

532
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:45,291
十五块？旅馆要价150 元
好 我付
-$15? The hotel charges $150.
-I'll pay that.

533
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:51,046
喔！115 元 为了冲浪课程？
就这样了 对吗？
150 bucks! For surf lessons?
That's it, right?

534
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,341
不然我们是再说什么？
有其他朋友吗？
-What else are we talking about?
-Got any friends?

-What face?

538
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,692
亲爱的 别担心
只是一个下午而已
Don't worry, honey.
It's just one afternoon.

539
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,278
你终究会有时间怀孕
继续你幸福快乐的生活
You'll still have plenty of time
to get pregnant and go on welfare.

540
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,030
好主意
应该会很好玩，潘
-Good idea.

-We'll play rip off the tourist.
-We're not ripping anyone off.

542
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:24,121
有人付1000元就住一晚
不是自己求人敲他竹杠吗
Anyone who pays $1,000 a night
for a room is just begging to be ripped off.

543
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,123

后面跟四个穿着丝绸内衣的女孩
and drop four Gs on silk boxers.

545
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,127
那怎么可能？
那是内衣
Yeah. How is that possible?
It's underwear.

546
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,297
他们的钱多的花不完
都是职业美式足球员 你开玩笑吧?
Yeah, those guys got money to burn.
They play in the NFL. Are you kidding?

547
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,383
我不在乎有没有钱
有其他更重要的
I don't care about the money.
Anything is better than this.

548
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,637

I thought his friends would be hot at least.

551
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,102
被人看到是跟你们在一起会很尴尬
This is so embarrassing to be seen with you.

552
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,729

要是看到认识的人怎么办 天啊！
What if we see people we know? God.

558
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,824
管他的  就是冲浪课程吗
运动员都像是这样吗？
Whatever. It's surf lessons.

If you don't watch out,
I'll make sure you drown out there.

564
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:20,594
今天还好吗？ 马特 很高兴认识你

Maybe we should go in.
It's getting late.

623
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,654

You know what I mean?

639
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,467

But if you want to come up to my room,

I would really like to do that,

他们会看着我们往你房间去，
They see us heading up to your room,

648
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,585

-Okay.

658
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,944
这样 你走电梯 我走后边门
You go up the elevator. I'll go up
the back way, so it's, like, inconspicuous.

659
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,072
真是鬼鬼祟祟  就像是007电影一样
闭嘴啦
-It's so sneaky. It's like James Bond.
-Just shut up.

660
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,840
抱歉
Excuse me.

661
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:42,703

663
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,708

Where you going?

664
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,503
我要-
我--我不知道这是不是你的房间
I just...
I didn't know if that was your room or not.

665
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,422
这是我房间

00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,726
晚上看起来不一样
是啊 很不错吧
-Looks different at night.
-Yeah, it's pretty nice.

669
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,897
我想--我想要
喔 厕所在那边
-I'm just gonna go...
-It's right there.

670
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,066
好的 我知道在哪  谢谢
I know where it is. Thanks.

671
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,472
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

672
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:47,768
喔，我只是要把藏着的钱找出来
I'm just trying to find the money that I hid.

673
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,270
什么，怕给女侍偷走？
是啊
-What, from the maid?
-Yeah. Right.

674
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:57,486

-Wait. That's way, way...

676
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:05,243
--那不就是1，000 块钱
我在这要一周 每天 150块钱
That's $1,000. I'll be here a week.
That's $150 a day,

677
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:10,207
我一次付清 自己打折少付50块
so I gave myself a $50 discount
for paying up front.

678
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,587
你这是要买断我？
不 不是 我只是不想要失去你
-Are you trying to buy me?
-No. No. I just don't want to lose you.

679
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,438
我可以问一个怪问题吗？
Can I ask you a really weird question?

680
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:36,191
可以
你喷了我的古龙水吗？
-Yeah.
-Are you wearing my cologne?

681
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:38,985
嗯 是啊
Yes.

682
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,864
那，嗯 很适合你
It smells good on you.

683
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,167
你是否该接一下
好吧
-You should probably get that.
-Yeah. Right.

684
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,676
嘿 嘿，宝贝
Yeah? Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

685
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,886
你好一些了吗？ 
Are you feeling better?

686
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,140
是啊
我先前有打，但没人接电话
Yeah, no, I tried to call earlier,
but no one was there.

687
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,476

我也爱你 好吧 再见
I love you, too. All right. Bye.

691
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,448
对不起 
Sorry.

692
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:28,285
我想这就是人家说的“无博爱”定律
I guess that's why
they have that no-fraternization rule.

693
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,369
你的意思是？
What do you mean?

694
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,706
接到妻子的电话质疑
Management gets call
from irate wife

695
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,625
怎么凌晨两点有一个女侍在房里
wondering why maid is in husband's room
at 2:00 in the morning.

696
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,004
那不是我妻子
妻子 女友 男友
-That's not my wife.
-Wife, girlfriend, boyfriend.

697
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,798
不 真的 那不是我妻子
看啊 是我外甥女
No, really. It's not my wife.
Look, it's my niece.

698
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:45,719
真的，我姊姊的女儿 洛贝卡
就是她
Actually, my sister's daughter, Rebecca.
There she is.

699
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,500
是这样啊
So.

700
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,600
我发誓
I swear.

701

她很漂亮
是啊 她长的很甜
-She's beautiful.
-Yeah, she is. She's a sweetheart.

702
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:00,192
对不起 小外甥女搞不清楚时差观念
Sorry about that. It's kind of strange
with the time difference and all.

703
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,569
或许我该走了 时间很晚了
I should probably go. It's getting late.

704
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,198
好吧  明天我们有冲浪课程吗？

706
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,118

just giving him lessons.

710
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,491
没错
是啊 教什么？
-I did.
 Yeah, in what?

711
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,493
潘妮 没有做完功课
Penny didn't finish her homework.

712
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,371
你又没在这帮我
应该要自己做作业的
-You weren't here to help me.
-Guys, she's gotta do her homework.

713
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,623
别胡扯什么
因为你正在那边工作
Don't give us shit
'cause you were out there working it.

714
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,167
闭嘴
别否认
-Shut up.
-Don't deny it.

715
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:03,463
你就像是在做些无聊的事
You were working it
like a rib without the sauce.

716
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,259
好吧 发生什么事？
喔 老天 什么事都没有发生

-No.
-Did you get some play? Did you? Did you?

719
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,891
我们吻了两秒钟
没啥大不了的
We kissed for, like, two seconds.
It wasn't a big deal.

720
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,270
我相信是
我出多少钱你才要讲？
I'm sure you did.
How much am I supposed to buy that for?

721
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,564
你把我当成什么了
我不知道
-God, what do you take me for?
-I don't know.

722
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,568
说真的 来吧 还有呢？
这里， 够付我们的帐了
-Seriously. What else? Come on.
-Here, this will pay the bills.

723
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,406
这似乎有 1，000块钱
我觉得好像是你的淫媒
There's, like, $1 ,000 here.
I feel like your pimp.

724
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,243
你要知道如何接吻
或者其他
You must know how to kiss, huh?
Or you must know how to do something else.

725
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,204
潘妮 晚安 你现在就要上床去
Goodnight, Penny. You're going to bed now.

726
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,003
嘿

-Hey.
-What's up?

727
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,468
听着，我不想要唠叨 
Look, I hate to be the buzzkill here,

728
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:55,098
但比赛剩下一周了
我认为现在不适合--
but the contest is in a week,
and I just don't think that it's time for...

729
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,727
我知道 但我答应他明天也有冲浪课
I know. But I did promise him
another lesson tomorrow.

730
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:03,189
可以取消吗？
不
-Can't you just blow him off?
-No.

731
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,692
为何不？
因为他已经付我钱了
-Why not?
-Because he already paid me.

732
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,278
真的
伊登
-Exactly.
-Eden.

733

我明天要租一个喷射滑板 （水上摩托车）
Well, I wanted
to rent a Jet Ski tomorrow.

734
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,201

737
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,459
我尽量啦
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

738
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,130
我们要去哪？ 
Where are we going again?

739
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,633
一个旅馆不会告诉游客的景点
A little spot the hotel
does not tell the tourists about.

740
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:41,811
天啊 你开车就像冲浪一样
我开车就像是我在冲浪一般
Oh, my God. You drive like you surf.
I drive like I wish I surfed.

741
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,486
真美
是啊 我小时候常常来
-Wow. This is beautiful.
-Yeah, I used to come here when I was a kid.

742
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,529
我梦见过整晚在冲浪 
I've been dreaming
about surfing all night.

743
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,157
明尼苏达也有迷冲浪啊
哦，是啊
-Oh, Minnesota's got surf stoke, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

744
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,412
快
Go!

745
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,707
哇！冲上去
Whoa! Hop on.

746
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:06,878
小心
Watch out. Whoa.

747
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,014

Yeah!

748
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,079
明尼苏达 你有几个姊妹啊？
How many sisters you got, Minnesota?

749
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,622
五个
五个？
-Uh, five.
-Five?

750
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,542
五个
真的吗？你是唯一的男生？
-Five.
-Really? You're the only boy?

751
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,044
是啊
那就是了
-Uh, yep.
-That explains it, then.

752
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,129
就是什么？
Explains what?

753
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,048
因此你不怕女人的威吓 
That's why you're not intimidated by women.

754
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,551
是啊
有那么好笑吗？
-Yeah.
-Why is that funny?

755
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,053
因为 我真的怕死了女人
Because I'm scared shitless of women.

756
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:01,891
我姊姊常常揍我
看着
My sisters would beat me on a regular basis.
See, look.

757
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,310
看到我的手指无法伸直了吗？
是的
-See how I can't extend my finger?
-Yes.

758
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,397
因为我八岁时被姊姊达娜打断
'Cause my sister Dana broke it
when I was eight,

759
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,315
只因为我不原离开她的房间而已
just because I wouldn't get out of her room.

760
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,234
是这样的
Because it's broken that way,

761
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,988
我扔出球，嗖的飞了出去，
比一般更有力量
when I throw the football,
it gives it a nice little zip.

762
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,323
只是轻轻的碰了一下？
是的
-A nice little touch?
-Exactly.

763
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,911
噢，有人来了
Uh, I think we got company.

764
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,165
噢，太好了
你认识这些人吗？
-Oh, great.
-What's up?

765
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,375
是的，我认识
我们得走了
-You know those guys?
-Yeah, I do. We gotta go.

766
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,461
真要走吗？
是得
-Really?
-Yeah.

767
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,254
收拾东西
Prepare to get vibed.

768
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,841
这里是“卡普”
意思是只对夏威夷本地人开放，小白
This place is kapu.
That means off-limits to you, haole.

769
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,892
你们好啊！
这里只对本地人开放
-What's up, guys?
-This is a local spot.

770
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,435
是的 我是本地的
他不是
-Yeah, and I'm a local.
-He's not.

771
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,479
你好！小白
德鲁，让开！
-What's up, haole boy?
-Drew, back off.

772
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:48,646
我们在这里长大，你只是来这里度假 
We grew here. You flew here.

773
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,482
这不关他的事
我很抱歉带他来
It's not his fault.
I'm sorry for bringing him.

774
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,150
你在我们的海滩上干什么，小白
What are you doing on our beach, haole boy?

775
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,777
你不是这里人，就不能在这里冲浪
You don't live here, you don't surf here.

776
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,069
德鲁
我们5秒钟就从这里消失 
Drew,
we'll be out in five seconds.

777
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,988
这里只对本地人开放
这里是我们男孩子的地方
This is a local spot.
Hey. This place is for the boys.

778
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,866
你知道不能让这个家伙来的
安妮玛丽 干什么呀
You know not to bring this guy over
here, Anne Marie. What's up with that?

779
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,451
兄弟，冷静点好吗！ 
Why don't you just relax, brah?

780
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,995
兄弟，谁跟你是兄弟了啊！
德鲁
-"Brah?" You telling me "brah"?
-Drew.

781
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,955
够了 你想打架吗？
德鲁 不要再碰我
-Where are you from, you honky?
-Drew, stop it.

782
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,457
你要干什么
德鲁 不要再碰我
-You want some of this?
-Drew, stop it.

783
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,708
不要再碰我
别碰她
-Don't even touch me.
-Don't touch her.

784
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:09,959
不准碰她！
德鲁 你想干嘛？
-What are you gonna do?
-Drew, grow up!

785
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,586
我拿了他的钱包
走吧，去冲浪了
I've got his wallet.
We're out of here. Let's go surf.

786
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,547
够了， ！德鲁
要像个大人
Stop, stop, stop. Drew, stop!
Act like an adult.

787
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,424
到车里去 够了 不要打了
走开
Just get in the car. Seriously, stop it.
Walk away.

788
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,468
够了 不要打了
你怎么这个样子啊？
Seriously, stop it.
Why do you have to be like this?

789
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,428
对了，
不准碰她 
-Right, get over there.
-Don't touch her.

790
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:22,347
那你想怎么样啊？
那你想怎么样啊？
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

791
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,270
求你了！你干什么呀？
你要干什么
-Please! What are you doing?
-You want some of this?

792
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,355
德鲁
Drew!

793
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,489
你们两个！够了！不要打了！
走开
Both of you! Get off! That's enough! Stop!
Get off!

794
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,866
你上车  行了！上车！
Get in the car! Stop it!
Stop. Get in the car.

795
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,619
不要打了，上车  上车啊
Now, stop it. Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

796
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,703
滚开
Walk away.

797
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,080
你真是一混蛋
You're an asshole.

798
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,249
我就该这么做
I do what I do best.

799
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,376
好了，兄弟
你了不起
-Relax, bro.
-You kicked his ass.

800
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,752
什么
了不起
-What?
-Kicked his ass.

801
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:56,256
有钱就了不起了，笨蛋
滚回去吧
Nice meeting you guys.
-Beat it. Go back to the mainland.

802
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,392
真愚蠢
This is bullshit.

803
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,315
我租了一辆水上摩托车
伊登 我知道
-I rented a Jet Ski.
-Eden, I know.

804
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,401
真抱歉，真的很抱歉
I'm sorry. I said I was
sorry a hundred times.

805
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,111
算了
真是他妈的
-Whatever.
-She's scared, man.

806
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,445
喂
Hello?

807
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,782
她怎么说？
What'd she say?

808
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,493
她都不在 干嘛
She's messing up, man.

809
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,345
没什么事吧！
噢，没有
-Everything okay?
-Oh, yeah. We'll be okay.

810
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:49,058
我明白为什么那些游客
不离开他们的酒店房间了
I can see why the tourists here
never leave their hotels.

811
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:54,606
不要谈那个
夏威夷人不都是这样的
他们-他们只是太过头了点
Oh! Don't say that. That's not real Hawaii.
They're just... They're just crazy.

812
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,401
他们特别在意他们的土地
他们的沙滩和那些海浪
They're so protective of their land
and their waves, especially.

813
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,485
还有他们的女人吧？
And their women?

814
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,242
怎么了？
真的很高兴来这里度假
-What?
-I'm glad I'm here.

815
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,269
噢！
Oh!

816
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,325
我要去训练了
那我起来
-I have to go to practice.
-I'll get up.

817
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,494
不用，不用了 继续你的好梦
真的？
-No, no, no, no. Sleep in.
-Are you sure?

818
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:52,080
当然了  继续睡吧
喔
-Yeah, you sleep.
-Okay.

819
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:53,498
那再见
再见
-Bye.
-Bye.

820
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,089
哦，糟了，
糟了
Shit. Shit.

821
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,064
喂
莉娜，是我
-Hello?
-Lena, it's me.

822
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,609
你在哪里啊？
不要担心我了
-Hey. Where are you?
-Don't worry about it.

823
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,238
不会吧，你在他的房间里？
你别管太多
-You're at his room, huh?
-It's none of your business.

824
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,532
我只想问问潘妮上学有没有问题
Listen, I just want to make sure
Penny gets to school okay.

825
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,367
没问题 不要担心
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

826
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,786
告诉我你们干了些什么啊？
以后会告诉你的了  
-What happened?
-I will tell you everything.

827
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,204
快点告诉我，小酒虫
Come on, little hooch.

828
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,706
不要这样叫我嘛 哦，我的天
Shut up. Oh, my God.

829
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,085
好吧好吧
那再见
-All right.
-Bye.

830
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,752
房间服务部，有什么可以帮你的吗？
Room service. Can I help you?

831
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,837
我想要份早餐
Yes, I'd like to order
some breakfast, please.

832
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,424
当然 托尔曼太太 你想吃点什么呢？
Of course, Mrs. Tollman. What can I get you?

833
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,967
嗯，草莓蛋糕吧
Uh, the blueberry waffles.

834
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,488
打扫房间的，
Housekeeping!

835
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,911
早安，阿洛哈，看看我们的小公主
Well, aloha! Look at you,
little miss princess.

836
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,246
是，是，是
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

837
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,249
你的漂亮拖鞋很合脚啊
我还穿着去游泳池了
-So the glass slipper fit, huh?
-I even went in the pool.

838
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,960
算了吧 你可真是够刺激人的啊
-Shut up! You're so irritating!

839
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,755
这不关我的事 是他追我的
还让我吃什么草莓蛋糕
It's wasn't my fault. He abducted me
and forced me to eat blueberry waffles.

840
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,799
草莓蛋糕？哪里啊？
外面桌上
-Blueberry waffles? Where?
-Outside.

841
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:08,883
很好吃的
Nice.

842
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,728
你干什么啊？
帮忙啊
-What are you doing?
-Helping.

843
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,315
你不再是个女侍了
过来 伊登 不要生我的气了
-Why? You're not a maid anymore.
-Come on, Eden. Don't be mad at me.

844
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,025
我没有
I'm not mad.

845
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,779
嗯！太好吃了  你怎么不加点奶油
Mmm. These are so good. You didn't
save me any whipped cream, though.

846
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:35,451
某人认为你穿着比基尼很性感，你就忘了比赛
Some guy thinks you look hot in a bikini,
and you forget all about the contest.

847
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,912
不是那样的，你知道的
That's not fair, and you know it.

848
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:41,457
香槟酒？你可真乐啊？
别说了
-Champagne? How cheesy are you?
-Shut up!

849
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,209
我不是生你的气
I'm not mad.

850
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:47,004
我只是刚好知道你在那里
It's just...
I happen to know that you kick ass out there,

851
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,342
你努力工作，去你想去的地方
and you worked very hard
to get to where you are.

852
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:52,718
我知道
I know.

853
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:58,349
冲浪名人赛三天后就开始了
每个赞助商都会来这里
Pipe is in three days.
Every single sponsor is here.

854
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,936
那天肯定有人会脱颖而出
不是你就是其他人
And it's just you and one
other girl out there.

855
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,314
我了解，我明白  好了吧
人们对你抱有很大的希望  
-I know. I got it. Okay?
-People would kill to be in your shoes.

856
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,024
我知道
I got it!

857
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:14,574
嘿，听我说 比赛肯定是放在第一位的
没有什么能改变
Hey, listen to me.
Contest comes first. Nothing changes that.

858
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,782
我将脱颖而出
会胜过你
I'm gonna whip it around
and put you into this left!

859
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,491

Yeah!

860
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,294
呜
Whoo!

861
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,338

Yeah.

862
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,151
看 看 来了
This is it. This is it, right there!

863
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,222
太棒了
Yeah!

864
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:54,900
糟了
Shit!

865
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,829
安妮玛丽！
Anne Marie!

866
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,373
你在哪里
Where are you?

867
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,961
安妮玛丽！
Anne Marie!

868
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,266
伊登，我在这里
Eden, over here!

869
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,608
快点快点
我们离开这里
Get on! Get on!
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

870
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,277
我抓到你了！我抓到你了！握紧
I got you! I got you! Hold on.

871
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,156
走啊！怎么了？握紧！
Move! What's wrong? Gun it!

872
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,949
伊登，离开这里！
哦，糟了
-Eden, get out of here!
-Oh, shit!

873
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,661
往外舀水！
Bail, bail, bail!

874
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,961
还好吧
刚才你在哪里啊？
-You all right?
-Where were you?

875
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,588
我就在你后面
看来我不行了
I was right behind you.
I couldn't get in without getting crushed.

876
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,258
你追我太急
你想我提前就被淘汰吗
You whipped me in way too deep,
and you need to kick out earlier.

877
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,260
难道我们不是一步一步在训练吗？
我想参赛
-Are you done with your excuses now?
-I want to go in.

878
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,386
我们休息一下吧
We'll rest for a minute.

879
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,264
我不想休息
我差点就死在那里了
I don't want to get some rest!
I almost frigging died out there!

880
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,392
你死不了
你只是在水下，差不多5秒钟
You did not almost die.
You were under for, like, five seconds.

881
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:55,062
不要象个巴比娃娃
你说什么，啊？
-Stop being such a Barbie.
-What did you say to me? What?

882
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,691
巴比娃娃  你怎么了
A Barbie? What is your problem?

883
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:03,529
我说如果这样你都受不了的话，
Look, all I'm saying
is that if you can't handle this,

884
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,781
你就不可能为那场比赛做好充分的准备
there's no way you're gonna be ready
for the Pipe Masters.

885
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:08,701
那好啊，你去啊
你有胆量，伊登，你去啊
Then you go!
You're so frigging ballsy, Eden, you go!

886
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,828
我不能  我不在被邀请的行列里
I can't. I wasn't invited.

887
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:15,458
我不管  你到底想要我怎么样啊
我想让你做的
-I don't know what the hell you want from me.
-You know, what I want from you

888
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,793
就是你自己去实现你的梦想
不要通过我
is to get your own life
and stop living through me!

889
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,296
实现你的梦想吧
Get your own dreams!

890
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,720
就算是的
那你想退出吗，你想引起人们的注意吗？
So that's it?
You gonna go run off and be a pro-ho, huh?

891
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,390
至少，还有人关心我
At least I have someone
that's interested in me!

892
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:44,653
怎么听起来那么熟悉啊？
遇到困难就缩头
Why does this seem so familiar, huh?
Run away when things get tough.

893
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,656
我重复了好多遍了，
我发现我好像在哄小孩一样
"I'm stressed out.
I think I'm gonna ditch my kid

894
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:51,702
为了一个在刚认识的男人而放弃比赛吗
闭嘴，伊登 我是认真的
-"and run away with some guy I just met."
-Shut up, Eden. I'm not kidding.

895
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,288
听起来很熟悉
不要管我！
-Sounds a little bit too familiar.
-Leave me alone!

896
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,916
像是母亲又像是女儿
闭嘴
-Like mother, like daughter.
-Shut up!

897
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,626
你想干什么
我就想不干了
That's what you're gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?

898
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,836
从我面前消失
那些看不起你的家伙看来是对的
-Get out of my face, Eden.
-You gonna prove these guys right?

899
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:04,507
为什么那些混蛋不认为你能冲浪呢
就是因为你放不开
Assholes who think that you can't surf Pipe
because you don't have the balls!

900
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,927
是的我也这么认为， 所以我不干了
我不干了
I guess so, then, 'cause I quit. I quit!

901
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,473
你不是个儒夫  你只是害怕
You're not a quitter. You're just scared.

902
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,690
嘿
Hey.

903
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:22,775
噢，天啦  你这是怎么了？
Oh, my God. What's wrong?

904
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,239
发生了什么事情吗？
是的
-Are you okay?
-No.

905
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,869
罗谢尔站在浪尖上
Wow, Rochelle Ballard rips!

906
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,915
我已经尽力了 不好意思，罗谢尔，
You wiped out! Sorry, Rochelle.

907
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,419
安妮玛丽在哪里啊？
管她呢？让我来玩一把
-Where's Anne Marie?
-Who cares? Let me play.

908
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,756
嘿，轮到我了
你输了，
Hey, it's my turn.
You got beat.

909
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,803
星期三，一个大浪天
It's hump day.
Wednesday, February 3.

910
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:55,391
我们已经知道北方和西北方
We've got that high-surf advisory in effect
for the north and northwest-facing shores.

911
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,106
很适合冲浪
There's definitely some size out there
in the water.

912
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,775
听起来有点太熟悉了
Sounds a little bit too familiar.

913
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,318
像是母亲，像是女儿
Like mother, like daughter.

914
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:14,201
这一直是你的梦想
注定的，
This is your dream.
This is what you were born to do.

915
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,291
不要落后那些家伙
伊登！
-Don't throw it away on this guy.
-Eden!

916
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,009
你不是个儒夫
你只是害怕，
You're not a quitter.
You're just scared.

917
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,761
我要成为世界上最好的冲浪手
I'm gonna be
the best surfer in the world.

918
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:38,309
总有人脱颖而出的
不是你，就是其他的女孩子
And it's just you and one other girl out there.

919
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,936
不是你，就是其他的女孩子
It's just you and one other girl out there.

920
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,589
糟了
你在干什么啊？
-Shit!
-What are you doing?

921
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,507
没有干什么
Nothing.

922
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:12,843
哇，你看起来
什么？
-Wow. You look...
-What?

923
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,553
这件衣服哪儿弄来的？
什么啊？
-Where'd you get that?
-What?

924
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,306
衣服啊
当然是商店里买的了
-The dress.
-From a store.

925
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,809
他买给你的吗？
是的 那又怎么样？
-He bought it?
-Yes, he bought it. So what?

926
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,312
我可以看到你的乳房
太好了
-So, I can see your boobs!
-Great.

927
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,648
她看起来很漂亮
谢谢
-I think she looks beautiful.
-Thank you.

928
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,651
这就是她要的样子
像个巴比娃娃
-She looks the way he wants her to look.
-Like Baywatch Barbie.

929
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,860
潘妮 闭嘴
Penny, shut up.

930
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,364
他要买了的全部吗？
潘妮！我现在没法做这些，喔？
-Is he gonna buy you implants, too?
-Penny! I just can't do this right now, okay?

931
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,449
看，那个小女孩竟然可以做的这么好
Man, that girl could rip.

932
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,246
是谁啊？
你啊
-Who is that?
-You.

933
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:46,460
那是你第一次在比赛中打败我的时候
That was the first time you beat me
at the Menehune Contest in Haleiwa.

934
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,505
你那时真的很狂
You were such a cocky little shit.

935
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:54,218
不要总谈些无聊的事情
你怎样成为第一的
Always talking all that trash
and how you would be number one.

936
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,805
我对你很生气
因为我知道你能行的
I was so pissed at you,
'cause I knew you would be.

937
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
有天分，还有狗屎运
All talented and shit.

938
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,852
男孩子们在结网 记得吗？
The boys were spinning. Remember that?

939
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:07,773
他们制定了很多的鸟规则
就是想让你在比赛中出丑
They had to throw up some bullshit rule
barring you from the boys' contest.

940
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,781
我要迟到了
他几天后就走了，晒的一身黑
-I'm gonna be late.
-He's leaving in a few days with a tan.

941
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,827
你呢？你留下了些什么呢？
一双名贵的鞋子吗？
And what are you gonna be left with?
A pair of shoes?

942
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,884
我要白金的
至少是银的
-I wanted platinum, but...
-At least it's an eight.

943
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,720
不是吗？
最好是的
-It is?
-It better be.

944
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:40,055
他说过是的  一又二分之一个银
He said it was. One and a half.

945
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,852
每个人都觉得我很性感
我是最性感的 你不是
-Everybody thinks I'm sexy.
I'm the sexiest...You ain't sexy! 

946
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,395
他什么也不懂的
He don't know anything.

947
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,064
蒂芙尼银饰品
你喜欢蒂芙尼
-Very Tiffany's.
-Then you always get to be at Tiffany's.

948
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:52,025
他喜欢你的全部，
一夜情
He likes your little some-some.
A little loving one night...

949
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,154
接着你也变了，更有吸引力
-Maybe then, you know.
-And then you get yourself a little upgrade.

950
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,869
晚安 欢迎光临
Good evening, miss.
Welcome to the Lanakai.

951
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,078
吉米，你在开玩笑吧
Jimmy, are you kidding me?

952
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:06,248
是我，安妮玛丽
哦，真是的，你看起来象变了一个人试的
-It's me. It's Anne Marie.
-Holy shit! You look insane!

953
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,459
谢谢
不用
-Thank you.
-All right.

954
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,429
哇喔，你看起来--
很难看吗
-Wow. You look...
-Weird.

955
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,056
不是，太美了
真的？
-No. No. Gorgeous.
-Really?

956
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,020
走吧  展示一下你自己 喔！
Let's go show you off. Ah!

957
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:44,077
现在是该那些幸运的人
Okay, now it's time
for a few of you lucky men

958
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,829
学跳我们的草裙舞了
to learn how to do the Tahitian hula.

959
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,457
有人自愿吗？
呵，
-Do we have any volunteers?
-Hell, yeah!

960
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,543
一群聪明伶俐的男人  一群有体型的人
Some intelligent men. Some men of size.

961
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,340
开始，来吧，祝我好运吧
Here I go. All right. Wish me luck.

962
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:01,386
把你们的手举在空中，
Get those hands up in the air. Come on, now.

963
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,982
快点 来吧，各位怪胎
Come on. Let's go, everybody. Totally freaky!

964
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,001
摇起来吧 快点！
Shake that thing. Come on!

965
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:39,049
摇起来吧 快点！
展示一下你自己！摇起来吧！
Shake that thing. Come on! Show them
what you're worth! Shake that thing!

966
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:57,192
嘿，我是“好热的”海浪预报员，
又一高浪过去了
How's it, wave riders?
We got that high-surf advisory posted again.

967
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:00,821
现在大概又15-20英尺高
Right now, it's a macking 15-to-20 feet.

968
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:05,701
明天肯定有浪管
那将是那些勇敢的女孩的好舞台
Out at Pipeline tomorrow,
the girls have the place all to themselves.

969
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,704
我们在这里谈些什么呢？
So, what are we supposed
to talk about with her anyways? 

970
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,622
风浪或者彗星
Windex, I guess, or Comet.

971
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,375
这里唯一知道风浪或者彗星的是
The only person who knows
anything about Windex or Comet

972
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,544
卡门，不是我
对啊
-in our house is Carmen, not me.
-You're right.

973
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,714
我希望她不要自认为他会娶她
Right. Seriously, you guys, I hope
she doesn't think he's gonna marry her.

974
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:22,426
她当然这么认为了
白马王子把她从这里赎了出去
Of course she does. Prince
Charming coming to save her from the toilets.

975
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,720
并且每年有一千万，
And get some of that $10 million a year.

976
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,931
喔，上帝
马特和女侍的经典之作
Oh, God!
Matt and the maid. It's classic.

977
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,727
你们看到她的衣服了吗？
Oh, my God.
Did you guys check out that dress? Hello?

978
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,646
她认为她来到了那里了，班级舞会吗？
God, where does she think
she's going, anyway? The prom?

979
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,190
她的鞋真的很可爱
You guys,
I thought her shoes were totally cute.

980
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:40,986
相信我，肯定是他给她的，
所有的，都是马特托尔曼给她的
Trust me on this. He made her up.
The whole Matt Tollman makeover.

981
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,196
看那些鞋子，衣服，还有手镯
Did you see the shoes, the dress,
the bracelet?

982
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,365
他的杰作，
His classic line.

983
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,160
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

984
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,245
你们记得丹尼的女服务员吗？
Do you guys remember
the Denny's waitress?

985
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,997
哦，是的
That's right. I remember.

986
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,416
她原来在丹尼
难怪看起来很眼熟了
She was from Denny's.
I knew she looked familiar.

987
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,503
马特喜欢穷女孩，他就是那样的
Matt loves to slum. That's just how he is.

988
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,923
不要这样说，那是他的个性
Come on. That's his style.

989
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,468
他喜欢那些不值钱的
便宜的野花
-He likes those cheap, little...
-Cheap Barbie... 

990
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,970
这双鞋是你的了
Here. They're all yours.

991
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,311
哦上帝
哦上帝 那不就是她吗？
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God. Was that just her?

992
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,647
是的
她在这里
-It was.
-She was here.

993
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:20,108
我们今晚的优胜者
你叫什么名字啊？
Our dancer tonight is Chief...
What's your name?

994
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,235
莱斯利 这里的每个人都叫我“胡桐爸爸“
Leslie, but everybody calls me Poon Daddy!

995
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,322
哇喔，优胜者是“胡桐爸爸“
-Aloha, Chief Poon Daddy!
-Aloha, Chief Poon Daddy!

996
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,032
哦，剑
Oh, yeah!

997
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:29,284
喔，宝贝，来吧，
Baby, go!

998
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,454
来吧  扭起来吧
Yeah. Shake it for us!

999
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:37,000
你的“胸”里是不是也有奶啊？
摇起来！摇起来！摇起来！
-You got milk in those coconuts?
Shake it, shake it, shake it!

1000
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,881
哦，  哦，
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1001
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,970
安妮玛丽 你去哪里啊？
安妮玛丽 站住
Anne Marie. Where are you going?
Anne Marie? Stop.

1002
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,266
怎么 哦，
What the... Oh, man.

1003
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,561
喔，安妮玛丽，喔
Ah, Anne Marie, what...

1004
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:12,202
安妮玛丽
Anne Marie.

1005
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,748
你到底在干些什么啊？
马特，我也不知道我在干些什么
-What the hell are you doing?
-I don't know, Matt. What am I doing?

1006
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:23,005
前天，我在叫早餐的时候，
The other day,
when I was ordering room service,

1007
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,466
服务员称我托尔曼太太，我没有纠正他，
the guy on the phone called me
"Mrs. Tollman," and I didn't correct him,

1008
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,595
因为那个时候
我好像真的是了
'cause for a minute,
I liked the way it sounded.

1009
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:36,768
但是我怀疑那个服务员是否真的这么认为
And I was just wondering
if the Denny's waitress felt the same way.

1010
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,731
听着
你知道的 我很好，喔
-Listen...
-You know what? I'm fine, okay?

1011
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,275
我知道我是谁  我能承受这些
I know what I am, and I'm fine with it.

1012
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,737
什么啊，你是谁啊
What? Who are you?

1013
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:52,951
我是你在度假的时候睡过的一个女佣人
我肯定是你故事的主角了
I'm the maid that you slept with on vacation.
I'm the great story you tell

1014
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,953
当你告诉别人你是怎样学会冲浪的时候 
when someone asks you
how you learned how to surf.

1015
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,961
你不相信任何人是吗？
我能吗？我能相信你吗？
-You don't trust anybody, do you?
-Can I? Can I trust you?

1016
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,964
干什么？
To do what?

1017
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,841
我的意思是-
I mean...

1018
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:14,306
你想要什么？
我想要什么？哦，上帝
-What do you want?
-What do I want? Oh, my God.

1019
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:18,935
我想要
I want

1020
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,232
戒烟，去上大学
Penny to quit smoking and to go to college.

1021
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,984
我想要
I want...

1022
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,612
一次付清电话费，电费和房租等所有的费用
I want to be able to pay the phone
and the electricity and the rent

1023
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:29,780
在一个月里
all in the same month.

1024
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,908
我想女孩子能成为冲浪杂志的封面人物，
I want a girl
to be on the cover of Surfmagazine,

1025
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:37,954
如果是我的话更好，如果是其她的女孩子也行的
and that would be great if that girl were me,
but any girl would do. And I want...

1026
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,334
我的意思是
我想要妈妈回家
I mean,
I wish my mom would come home.

1027
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:47,839
我真的真的很想赢明天的比赛
And I really, really want
to win Pipe Masters tomorrow.

1028
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,219
这就是我想要的
好的，那就实现它啊，
-That's what I want.
-Well, do it.

1029
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:59,768
马特，你不明白的
浪管是世界上最凶的浪
Matt, you don't understand, okay? Pipe...
Pipe is the heaviest wave in the world, okay?

1030
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,105
好的，那你就不要在这里工作
你会死的
You don't just get worked there. You die.

1031
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,689
有人就死在浪管里
People die there.

1032
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,947
如果真发生这种事情 是我没用
一个浪都应付不了
And what happens when I just paddle out
and I don't take off in a single wave?

1033
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,699
我不在乎我自己，
'Cause I don't care
if I make a fool out of myself,

1034
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,119
但我不想让家人难过
but I do not want to embarrass my family,

1035
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,455
我不想让莉娜，伊登和潘妮难过
她们是我的家人
and that's what Lena and Eden
and Penny are. They're my family.

1036
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:29,214
能告诉我该怎么做吗
Just tell me what to do, please.

1037
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:32,759
你想我告诉你该怎么做吗？
是的
-You want me to tell you what to do?
-Yes.

1038
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:36,054
你知道该怎么做的
我不知道，马特，我确实不知道
-You know what to do.
-No, Matt. I honestly don't.

1039
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,476
就象那天我在沙滩上碰到的那个女孩
Just be the girl I met on the beach.

1040
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:44,229
谁啊，是谁？
Who? Who was she?

1041
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:48,400
一个从不让其他人告诉她要做什么的女孩
The girl who'd never ask a guy what to do.

1042
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,159
早安，各位，欢迎来到比赛现场
Good morning, everybody.
Welcome to the Pipe Masters

1043
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,995
瓦胡岛北岸的浪管万岁，
here at Banzai Pipeline,
on the North Shore of Oahu.

1044
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,664
今天你将看到女子冲浪最具历史意义的一天
You're gonna be watching
women's surfing history today,

1045
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,584
这些女孩们将要征服这些死亡之浪，
as these girls take on
the deadliest waves in the world.

1046
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,545
想想尼亚加拉河瀑布直冲而下的情景，
Imagine the Niagara Falls
dumping into two feet of water

1047
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:12,799
这里有熔岩形成硬岩和锋利的珊瑚礁
还有水下洞穴
over hard-rock lava with razor-sharp reef
and underwater caves.

1048
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:15,302
今天可是20英尺的浪啊
It's gonna be a macking 20 feet,

1049
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:19,639
祝福今天参赛的女士们，
so good luck to all the ladies
competing today at the Pipe Masters.

1050
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,516
她们都是世界上最好的选手
They may be the best in the world,

1051
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,560
命运就在她们自己的手上
but they're gonna have
their hands full today.

1052
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,937
今天不仅仅是一次冲浪的比赛，
If you're going down to watch,
it's not a day for a dip in the water.

1053
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,982
安妮玛丽 你还好吗？
嗯，
-Anne Marie. You all right?
-Mmm-hmm.

1054
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:35,197
你们走吧
我找个地方停车
You guys get out here.
I'll go find some parking.

1055
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,240
太好了，这次的分数肯定很高，
Pretty much
an impossible score at this point.

1056
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:40,744
她远远的落在了后面
但她还是不想放弃
She's way behind, but she's still
gonna try to put it on the line.

1057
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:42,370
她想冲这一次
Looks like she's going for this one.

1058
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:45,790
哦，她的冲浪板被劈成了两半
Oh, and she broke her board.

1059
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:49,628
对冲浪者来说，每天都是刺激的
但是，今日不比往常
You know, any day at Pipeline is critical,
but today,

1060
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:53,840
一次的失误，造成的后果都是惨重的，
one false move,
and the consequences could be disastrous.

1061
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:58,428
在这里丧生的冲浪者远比其他的地方要多
More surfers have died here
than any other spot on the planet combined.

1062
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,890
这是第一次让女人来参加这个比赛，
This is the first time the girls
have gotten to compete at Pipeline.

1063
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,518
所有的冲浪社团都来了
所有的赞助商，星探
The entire surf media's here today.
Every sponsor, talent scout,

1064
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:09,522
冲浪媒体
都来看这次精心动人的比赛，
the entire surf media,
looking to find the next surf sensation.

1065
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:13,401
哪怕只有一次惊人演出
你都会成为冲浪史上的一页
You get one good ride here today,
and you'll put yourself on the surfing map.

1066
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,946
正在冲浪的是琳内特 麦肯齐氏
So out there by herself is Lynette MacKenzie,

1067
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,240
在沙滩上的是美耿和被劈坏了的冲浪板
now that Megan's on the beach
with a broken board.

1068
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,951
她是个好的冲浪手 她退出了
She's in a nice one. She's coming in.

1069
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,749
选择这个浪头肯定是个错误
You really have to commit out here
in order to get the wave.

1070
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,794
但我相信她的分数已经很不错了
But I'm sure it'll better the score
she already has...

1071
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,545
谢谢你，卡拉
祝你好运，莱恩
-Thanks, Cara.
-Good luck, Layne.

1072
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,588
谢谢，我能行的
Thanks. I could use it.

1073
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,257
我来参赛的
I'm here for the competition.

1074
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,717
你是自愿者吗？
她是参赛者
-Are you a volunteer?
-She's a competitor.

1075
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,094
你必须签了这个
Okay, you need to sign this release form.

1076
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:46,268
伤亡保险
"In case of death or dismemberment?"

1077
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:49,396
谢谢
你第四 和凯特斯卡拉特一起
Thank you.
You'll be in heat four with Kate Skarratt.

1078
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,314
你可以先到参赛员区等着
You can go ahead and wait
in the competitor's area.

1079
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:54,401
谢谢
祝你好运
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

1080
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:56,840
看起来很吓人啊
Looks scary.

1081
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,077
喔，那就是凯特 斯卡拉特
Oh, my gosh. There's Kate Skarratt.

1082
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,622
她是个好手
那是罗谢尔 巴拉德
She kills it at Pipe.
And there's Rochelle Ballard.

1083
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,582
她是做背切的女王
She's queen of Backdoor.

1084
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,794
喔 莱恩比克利
是-我知道她们
-Oh, my gosh. Layne Beachley...
-I know who they are.

1085
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:17,549
什么，我-你行的
我只是想说她们 她们真的很厉害
What? I'm... You're good.
I'm just saying they're, like, really good.

1086
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:23,722
糟了
Shit!

1087
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:28,394
来吧，走
Come on, let's go.

1088
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:29,436
嘿
Hey!

1089
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,813
你好
你好，兄弟
What's up?
-What's up, man?

1090
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,982
你好，女孩
哪儿可以停车啊， 
-What up, girl?
-Where's parking around here?

1091
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,818
只要你能找到地方，哪儿都可以的了
Anywhere, I guess. Whatever you can find.

1092
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,195
看来这次她要冲了
Looks like she's going on this one.

1093
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,040
嘿，安妮玛丽 看我带谁来了
Hey. Hey, Anne Marie. Look what I found.

1094
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,332
下一轮 克阿拉 肯内利
Up next, Keala Kennelly.

1095
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:50,332
嗨
Hey.

1096
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,169
只是玩玩
你好，冲浪女孩 去做你那鸟事吧
-Just driving by.
-What's up, surfer girl? Do the damn thing!

1097
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,339
糟了 
Shit!

1098
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:06,056
到20英尺了
太不可思议了 太美妙了
Be alert out there.
It's a super-clean, west-northwest swell.

1099
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,601
浪管和浪墙都有了
Pipe and Backdoor are both open.

1100
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,730
有点耐心
不要太激动了
Yeah. Just be patient.
Don't get too anxious.

1101
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:17,859
每隔20秒钟就有连续的四浪
注意掌握时间
It's four-wave sets with 20-second intervals.
Take your time.

1102
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,821
不要冲第一浪
第三好像事最好的
Don't take the first wave of the set.
Third wave looks the best.

1103
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:26,409
肯内利来了 起飞，俯冲
Here comes Kennelly
taking off. Steep drop.

1104
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:29,079
她做了个底转向
她太凶了
-Takes the bottom turn.
-She's fierce, man.

1105
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,956
她被盖住了
She's covered up.

1106
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,752
喔，她出来了
She makes it out.

1107
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:39,005
给她鼓掌吧
我怕不一定能成功
Applaud it to her.
I'm way out of my league.

1108
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:43,593
嘿，别想太多了
就当是去娱乐一把
Hey, no worries.
Just go out there and have fun.

1109
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,012
“娱乐”
Fun?

1110
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:53,561
下一个 来自澳大利亚的伍伦贡
穿红衣服的凯特 斯卡拉特
Up next from Wollongong,
Australia, we have Kate Skarratt in red.

1111
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:56,022
她的脚底功夫厉害，
这样是她冲浪的时候很有优势
She's a goofy foot,
which favors her at Pipeline.

1112
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:59,609
喜欢挑战大浪
这使她在”绰普“成为了的第一名
Loves charging big waves
and has taken first place at Teahupoo,

1113
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,903
一个横冲直撞，大溪地的左撇子
another barreling left-hander in Tahiti.

1114
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,490
下一个选手 持外卡参赛
安妮玛丽 查德威克，
Surfing against her, we have wild-card entry
Anne Marie Chadwick,

1115
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:09,577
以前的冠军，后来退出了巡回赛
a formerjunior NSSA champion
who dropped out of the competitive circuit

1116
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:14,582
因为三年前就是在这里的一起事故
after a near-drowning incident
at this very spot just three years ago.

1117
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,545
5，4，3，2，1
Five, four, three, two, one.

1118
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:58,460
20分钟一轮，取四轮中最高分
We've got 20-minute heats
today with the top four waves scoring.

1119
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,587
选择浪是关键
Wave selection is critical.

1120
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,923
如果选错了浪，被卷了进去，
If you pick the wrong wave, wipeout,
get caught inside...

1121
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:06,217
那就是在今天的激烈的比赛中
Well, the currents are fierce today,

1122
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,219
你只能在一旁做陪衬了
and you can spend the rest of your heat
just trying to...

1123
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,138
怎么样
很好
-How's it going?
-Good.

1124
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:13,433
接近得很漂亮
选择个好浪
Nice set approaching.
We got good sets out the back.

1125
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,685
浪得频率真得很好
We have really good consistency
with the swell today.

1126
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:19,314
来了
好像会到15-20英尺
It's on the rise. It's probably gonna get up
to about 15-to-20 feet.

1127
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:23,693
凯特 斯卡拉特来了， 她在滑行，她站起来了
Kate Skarratt's going on this one.
She's paddling. Gets to her feet.

1128
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:26,362
俯冲，来了个漂亮得底转弯
Makes the drop. Solid bottom turn.

1129
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,992
看看这个美妙的场景
Look at that pit!

1130
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,244
她进入了下一轮，她通过了
She's setting her line.
Breezing to make it out.

1131
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,581
尽力到肩部地带
Trying to get in the shoulder.

1132
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:42,253
滑行 喔，最后的一个转弯没有处理好
Traveling, traveling... Oh! She didn't quite
get around that last section.

1133
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,549
不管怎样她得分了
She'll get some kind of score for it.

1134
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,345
好像是4 1
Looks like it's a 4.1
that came out on the board.

1135
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,139
巡逻人员找到了她， 她看起来没有什么事情
Water patrol’s checking on her.
Looks like she's okay.

1136
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:55,850
如果她想继续，她就可以滑回去
She doesn't need a ride.
She's paddling back out.

1137
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:01,648
查德威克 一个人呆在那里
So, Chadwick all alone by herself out there,
yet to even score a ride.

1138
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,193
去吧去吧，滑行，好像要来她的第一了
-Go, go! Paddle!
-Headed for her first ride.

1139
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,495
停止了
狗屎
-Backs out.
-Shit!

1140
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,919
没办法
多漂亮的浪啊
No way.
She's not gonna get any more like that.

1141
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,046
真是浪费
她不该停止的，
-What a waste of wave.
-Shoot! She should've gone.

1142
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:28,550
也许刚才会是她的一个好的开始
狗屎
-That would've opened up perfectly.
-Shit!

1143
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,301
一个人呆在那里可不行的
你行的
-When you're out there all alone...
-You can do it, girl.

1144
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,804
你要相信自己
...you can psych yourself out.

1145
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,223
查德威克 在等下一次
你在干什么啊
Chadwick is waiting for the next.
Baby, what are you doing?

1146
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:38,726
凯特 斯卡拉特 选择了一个今天好浪
Kate Skarratt paddling
into one of the best waves of the day.

1147
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:41,896
哦，看看这个浪，像个炸弹一样
Whoa! Look at this wave. It is the bomb.

1148
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:46,609
哦，她滑的过头了
Oh! A little overextended. Goes down.

1149
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,736
她被卷下去了
Getting sucked up and over the falls.

1150
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,419
希望她没事
Hope she's okay out there.

1151
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:05,503
哦
Ooh!

1152
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:09,424
凯特斯卡拉特退下来了
浪管找到她了
Kate Skarratt down.
Water patrol coming to pick her up.

1153
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,596
离开了危险区
Gets her on the sled and out of harm's way.

1154
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,888
抓住
Hang on!

1155
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:22,228
哎哟， 各位，请大家不要靠的太近
Okay, everybody. As the Ski comes up
on the beach, please give them some room.

1156
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:25,481
巡逻人员需要些地方，以便他们能做的更好
The water patrol needs some space
to work on Kate Skarratt,

1157
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,442
凯特 斯卡拉特最后一次冲浪失败了
who's gone down on that last wave.

1158
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:30,528
他们的冲浪板翻了
主要是这个浪不是很好
They're carrying the backboard down.
This isn't good.

1159
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,323
需要乐兰 道医生报告伤势情况
We need Dr. Leland Dao
to report to the medical tent.

1160
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:37,577
乐兰道，请报告帐篷里的情况
请立刻到这里来好吗
Leland Dao, please report to the medical
tent. We need you down here immediately.

1161
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:44,230
来吧来吧
Come on, come on.

1162
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,633
冲啊
Charge it!

1163
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,429
上，上，上
-Go.
-Go, go, go!

1164
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,140
上，上，上
Go! Go!

1165
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:11,444
她站在了板上
哦，落下的很规范
She sets herrail.
Makes the drop. Textbook.

1166
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:16,616
站的太漂亮了
看，多漂亮的浪啊
Oh, it's setting up perfectly.
Look at that beautiful wave.

1167
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,872
她能得到一个高分 是的
-She should get a nice score for this one.
-Oh, yes.

1168
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,874
足够她进入下一轮的分数
High enough to take her into the next round.

1169
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:29,671
不 不 不
No, no, no.

1170
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,139
哦
Oh.

1171
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,313
哦，她本来做的很好的
Oh, she got so worked.

1172
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:29,772
我看不到她了，她到哪儿去了
I don't see her. Where is she?
Do you see her?

1173
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:30,982
她还好吗
Man, is she all right?

1174
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,984
她在哪里？
浮上来，安妮玛丽，浮上来
-Where is she?
-Come up, Anne Marie. Come up.

1175
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:02,555
哦
Ow.

1176
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,670
安妮玛丽遭受了重创
Anne Marie's taking
a heavy beating out there.

1177
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:48,976
抓紧我的手
Grab my hand!

1178
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:52,980
我抓到你了，抓好
I got you. Hang on.

1179
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,573
现在她肯定没法管她的分数了， 裁判的分数应该出来了
Not that she probably cares
right now, but the judges' score just came in

1180
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,743
最后一次的的分是4．6
and rewarded her a 4.6 for the last ride,

1181
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:09,413
这使她超过了斯卡拉特而进入下一轮
which will move her into the next round
over Skarratt.

1182
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,333
安妮玛丽！有事吗？
-Anne Marie.
-Are you okay?

1183
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,960
她能好吗？
能好 让我们试一试
-Is she gonna be okay?
-Yes. Just give us a moment.

1184
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,711
安妮玛丽！有事吗？
Anne Marie, are you all right?

1185
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:17,880
她还好吧 她还好吧
-Is she gonna be all right?
-Is she gonna be all right?

1186
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:20,758
她没问题的 让她清醒一下
-She'll be okay. Just give her some room here.

1187
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:24,595
她没有问题吧？
应该没有什么问题的
-Is she gonna be okay?
-I think so.

1188
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,306
啊
Ah!

1189
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,937
我将放些冰块
Gonna put some ice on it.

1190
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,857
抬起你的头
Lift your head.

1191
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,945
躺着休息会儿
Just lay there and relax for a minute.

1192
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,285
嘿
Hey.

1193
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,872
如果你再说我是那个沙滩女孩的话，
If you tell me "be the girl on the beach"
right now,

1194
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:52,280
我踢死你
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1195
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,510
哦
Oh.

1196
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,088
那你怎么样啊 很好
-So how are you feeling?
-I've been better.

1197
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,924

Yeah.

1198
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:08,890
我 我的第一次NFL比赛
我在场上找不到位置
My first NFL game,
I got blindsided by Warren Sapp,

1199
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:12,059
告诉你 我一生中重来没有受过那么大的打击
and I'll tell you,
I've never been hit so hard in my life.

1200
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,103
我躺在那里，希望哪里受了严重的伤
I just lay there,
praying that something was broken

1201
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,605
那样我就没有必要坚持完那场比赛了
so I wouldn't have to get up
and finish the game.

1202
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,899
你觉得我是假装吗？
You think I'm faking it right now?

1203
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:21,193
不是的，我知道你撞到了岩石
就象我当初那样
No, I know you got rocked out there,
just like I did.

1204
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:26,324
但是莱斯利让我坐下，
告诉我说那是被撞的最厉害的一次
But Leslie sat me down and said that
that was the hardest I'd ever be hit

1205
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:31,746
他也后悔没有重新回到场上
因此我有回去了
and that I would regret not going back in.
So, I went back in.

1206
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,790
你们赢了那场比赛
And you won the game.

1207
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,335
没有，实际上我们输了
 No, actually, we lost,

1208
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,880
我难过死了
and I got my ass kicked.

1209
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,802
但那却是我最美好的回忆
But there was this one beautiful pass,

1210
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:51,098
我传了一个绝好的球给奥马尔
one perfect spiral
right into Omar's fingertips,

1211
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,767
然后触地得分了
and a touchdown.

1212
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,357
光说是没有办法重现当时地情景地
 Look, I can't talk you
into going back out there.

1213
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:01,734
太爽了
It seems crazy.

1214
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:09,033
但是我知道你很棒地 我也知道这对你意味着什么
But I know how good you are,
and I know how much this means to you.

1215
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:13,245
我只是不想你到时候后悔你现在做的一切
I just don't want you to spend your life
wondering what could've been.

1216
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,506
各位注意了 大浪就要来了
Heads up on the beach, people.
Big set approaching.

1217
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,008
嘿 我们必须后退点
Hey, everybody, we have a set out the back.

1218
01:28:26,093 --> 01:28:31,180
看好你们的孩子和你们的东西
大浪来了
Watch your kids, watch your belongings.
The water is coming over the berm.

1219
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,475
这个很危险
浪到了最高峰了
It's dangerous out there. The water patrol
already has their hands full,

1220
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,852
如果你们能稍微的退后一点， 我们将感激不尽
so we'd appreciate it if you'd just back up.

1221
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,188
看来今天浪越来越大了
Here, today, we have a rising swell,

1222
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:42,358
因此各位一定要小心了
so I wanted to give a little word of warning
to everybody.

1223
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,237
嗨，我知道现在不是时候，我们照张像好吗？
-Guys, look, this is really not a good time.
-Can we get a picture?

1224
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,655
什么？ 照张像
-What?
-Can we get a picture?

1225
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,115
看啊，在我们这里工作的小妞
See, we're working these chicks over here.

1226
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,283
她们说你好像是个有名的 曲棍球运动员或是什么的
They think you're some great hockey player
or something like that.

1227
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,702
你开玩笑吧 我真的
-You're kidding.
-No joke, man.

1228
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,746
这些我把它照下来
你过这边来，卡拉
I want to get this thing done.
Here you go, Kala.

1229
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,581
不好意思，我身上很脏
照了
Sorry, my pits stink,
but that's just the way it goes.

1230
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,542
好了，走吧 走右边
Okay, let's go. Right here.

1231
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,836
笑一笑  你在度假 看这里
看这里
-Smile. You're on vacation. Over here.
-This way.

1232
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,839
笑一笑 来点感情
Fluff your bangs up a little bit.
Just a little bit more attitude in there.

1233
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,007
太漂亮了
好的，太好了
-Beautiful.
-All right. Great.

1234
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,091
再来一张 来吧
One more, one more. Come on.

1235
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,843
嘿 嘿
-Hey.
-Hi.

1236
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:11,429
你确定还要参加吗？ 是的
-You going back out there?
-Yep.

1237
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,390
这是个愚蠢的比赛 不值得去冒险
It's just a stupid contest.
Not worth getting hurt over.

1238
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:15,850
我没事的 嘿
-I'll be fine.
-Hey.

1239
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,644
什么啊 小心点
-What?
-Be careful.

1240
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,523
好的
Yeah.

1241
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:26,152
第二轮开始了
That sounds
the start of the next heat.

1242
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,738
查德威克看来要全力一搏了
So, Chadwick's pretty much
got her hands full with this next round.

1243
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,907
夏威夷的克阿拉 肯内利现在领先
We have Keala Kennelly from Kauai.
She's a charger.

1244
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:35,578
她可以应付一切大浪， 她可像男人那样的潇洒
She goes on anything.
And she goes like the men out here.

1245
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,753
好像滑行一样 她们过去了
There's a bit of a paddle battle
going on out there.

1246
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:47,298
看起来查德威克和肯内利 想滑到最高峰去
Looks like Chadwick and Kennelly
are just paddling for the peak.

1247
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,884
查德威克在较里面的位置
Chadwick's got the inside position
as a big set approaches.

1248
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,053
大浪来了，她将第一个碰到 上，上
-Looks like she's gonna get the first wave.
-Come on. Come on.

1249
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,222
这个滑行赛将决定谁会第一个碰到浪头
This paddle battle is really about
who's gonna get the first wave.

1250
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:57,475
查德威克领现，她好像会碰到第一个
Chadwick in position.
Heading for the first wave.

1251
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,477
开始滑行了，她要上了
Starts to paddle. She's going for it.

1252
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,107
哦，她被拉回去了 肯内利成功的抓住了机会
Oh, she pulls back.
Kennelly's wide open. She catches the wave.

1253
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:12,740
一次又一次失败
God! Time and time again, man.

1254
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:34,220
她出来了 看她多轻松啊
She's out,
making it look so easy.

1255
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:38,390
但是各位 那可是很难的哦
查德威克开始滑行
But, folks, it's not easy out there.
Chadwick's starting to paddle.

1256
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,645
她又来了 还不够好
She paddles for it. Doesn't quite get it.

1257
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,650
又浪费了一个好机会
What a waste of wave.

1258
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,074
当你考虑到分数的时候，你会很伤心的
That's gotta hurt,
when you know you need a score,

1259
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:57,618
当你得到了一个好的浪，就像这次
and you're going up against
one of the best surfers in this event,

1260
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,829
但你却没有上
and you don't go.

1261
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:04,250
有足够的时间让肯内利回到她的位置
Plenty of time being allowed here
for Kennelly to get back in position,

1262
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:09,421
她就在查德威克的旁边滑行，
她好像又要上了
and she's paddled right inside of Chadwick,
and she's looking to catch her next wave.

1263
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,778
女士 先生们 克阿拉 肯内利，
Keala Kennelly.
Hands together, ladies and gentlemen.

1264
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:35,656
克阿拉 肯内利，成功了两次了
Keala Kennelly.
A great tube ride out here at the Pipeline.

1265
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,783
克阿拉 太棒了
Keala's pretty much got sack.

1266
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:39,368
像男人那样的潇洒
She goes like the men out here.

1267
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:41,996
查德威克好像一次也没有
For some reason,
Chadwick has yet to even ride a wave.

1268
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,372
不知怎么一回事情
I don't know what's going on out there.

1269
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:44,915
不知道她是不是在玩心理战
I don't know
if she's just psyching herself out

1270
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,917
或者克阿拉根本就不把它放在心上
or if Keala's just putting it to her.

1271
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:55,593
你在干嘛 什么啊？
-What are you doing?
-What?

1272
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,470
你是来冲浪还是当浮标的啊
You gonna take a wave,
or are you just gonna sit there like a buoy?

1273
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:01,557
你知道你一次也没有冲，只是坐在那里
Look, you're never gonna catch a wave
sitting all the way over here in the channel.

1274
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,976
跟着我，让我带着你
Why don't you follow me over to the peak,
actually get you into one.

1275
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:08,397
给观众一些惊喜
这个浪给你 来吧
Give the crowd something to cheer about.
Let's get you a wave. Come on.

1276
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:14,570
照我说的做，我告诉你什么时候该上
All right, follow me into the line-up,
and I'm gonna tell you to go on a wave.

1277
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:18,032
我说上，你就上
And when I tell you to go, you gotta go.
You gotta paddle your little heart out.

1278
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:22,119
放心大胆的去 不要犹豫 不要后退
不要后退 不要怕，好吗
You can't hesitate. You can't pull back.
You can't hold back. No fear, all right?

1279
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:25,247
因为只要你由于一秒钟，你就玩玩了
Because if you hold back for a second,
you're gonna eat shit.

1280
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:27,208
来吧，跟着我
So, come on. Follow me.

1281
01:32:33,632 --> 01:32:35,466
看来下一个浪要来了
It looks like
the next set's approaching.

1282
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,928
就是这个，上
Right. This is the one. Go!

1283
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:42,560
滑行，滑行 上  滑行，滑行
Paddle, paddle! Go, girl! Paddle! Paddle!
Go! Paddle!

1284
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,090
继续
Go!

1285
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,101
啊
Yeah!

1286
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,853
上
Whoo! Go!

1287
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,496
哦，我的天
Oh, my God!

1288
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,023
你没事吧
没事，没事
-You all right?
-I'm okay. I'm okay!

1289
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:35,150
真的没事
是的，没事
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1290
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:37,403
回去吧
Get back out there, then.

1291
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,827
只有两分钟了
With only two minutes left in her heat,

1292
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,954
查德威克 努力的回到了她的位置，
Chadwick struggles to get back
into the line-up

1293
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,914
因此她可以开始
so she can catch this one wave.

1294
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:52,918
查德威克 还没有一次有效的冲浪，她还没有得分
Chadwick yet to even score a good ride,
a scoring ride.

1295
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:56,964
她要为她挽回点面子 克阿拉完全的控制了比赛
She needs to redeem herself here.
Keala is absolutely dominating this heat,

1296
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,383
查德威克需要给她的记分牌上留下个分数
and Chadwick needs to collect a scoring ride
on this one.

1297
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,064
哦 你好吗
Ouch. You all right?

1298
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,608
那个太差了，我要下一个
-That was nasty.
-It's okay. I want another one.

1299
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:18,152
你要下一个
是
-You want another one?
-Yep.

1300
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,571
就是那个
来吧，这是最后的一个了 来吧
That's the spirit!
Shake off that last wave and let's do this.

1301
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,198
只有20秒钟了，正让人激动
-Less than 20 seconds remaining...
-Feel that adrenaline in you? Use it.

1302
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,450
安妮玛丽 查德威克只有一次机会了
...Anne Marie Chadwick only has
one more chance.

1303
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,410
用力划，女孩
Paddle, girl.

1304
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,583
看，那是一天中最好的一个浪
On the outside, here comes one of
the best sets of the whole day coming in.

1305
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,252
太美妙了
We have lines stacked to the horizon.

1306
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:42,468
来了
Here comes the set.

1307
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:47,598
就是这个
好的，来吧！ 上，上
This is the one. This is the one, right here.
All right. Come on. Go! Come on. Go! Go!

1308
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,685
上，女孩
查德威克就在那里，在使劲的滑行
Come on, girl. Go!
Chadwick is there. Paddle hard!

1309
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,520
用力划！用力划！
上！上！
-Paddle hard! Paddle hard!
-Go! Go!

1310
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:57,691
上，上，上
这是你的，不要迟疑
-Go! Go! Go!
Yeah. This is yours! Don't pull back!

1311
01:34:57,776 --> 01:35:00,736
上，上，上 上，上，上
-Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go!

1312
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:13,870
哦
Whoo!

1313
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,649
哦
Whoo!

1314
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,000
哦，狗屎
Oh, shit

1315
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:58,085

Yeah!

1316
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:00,587
哦
Whoo!

1317
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:01,672

Yeah!

1318
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:03,924
哦
Whoo!

1319
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:07,636
她成功了
她是我们这里的人
-She makes it!
-That's my bitch!

1320
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,859
太棒了
That was insane!

1321
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,490
哦 
Whoo!

1322
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:31,243
看裁判给分了
他们已经有了结果了 好像一致通过了
Waiting on the judges' scores.
They're coming in.

1323
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:34,121
看看记分牌，好像是10分
Looks like unanimous 10s across the board.

1324
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,748
不是很高，但是超过了肯内利，进入了下一轮
Not enough to overtake Kennelly
and move into the next round,

1325
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,959
但是她是今天的英雄
but she is a hero with the crowd here today.

1326
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,879
哦，她是我的姐姐
That's my sister! Whoo!

1327
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,131
她是我的姐姐
That's my sister! 

1328
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,383
难以用言语来表示
Just words don't explain it.

1329
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,344
因为 安妮玛丽 查德威克 做了一次如此成功的表演
For Anne Marie Chadwick
to get a ride like that

1330
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:52,890
所有北岸的冲浪社团都看在眼里
with the entire North Shore
surf community watching...

1331
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:01,607
太棒了
-That was insane!
-Yeah!

1332
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:04,526
我们这为她骄傲
I'm so proud of her.

1333
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:12,618
可以签个名吗 可以签个名吗
-Can I have your autograph?
-That was insane.

1334
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:15,662
那些都是我教她的
She's my bitch.
I taught her everything she knows.

1335
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:18,248
你叫什么名字
她是我们这里的女孩
-What's your name?
-That's right. That's our girl.

1336
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,335
嘿
Hey.

1337
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:25,255
真让人敬佩
谢谢
-That was awesome.
-Thank you.

1338
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,257
嘿，你该看看冲浪板，伊登的冲浪板
Hey, you should check out the boards.

1339
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,512
嗨，安妮玛丽， 借过 嗨
-Hey, Anne Marie.
-Hi.

1340
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,722
我是“绿洲”的杰西卡
Excuse me, Anne Marie.
I'm Jessica from Billabong.

1341
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,098
能和你谈谈关于加入我们社团的事情吗
I'd love to talk to you
about being on our team.

1342
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,601
排队等等吧，宝贝 喔
-Wait your turn, honey.
-Okay.

1343
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,604
她知道她和上镜吗
-Does she know she got beat?
-Nice, isn't it?

1344
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:43,398
嘿
Hey.

1345
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,613
哦
