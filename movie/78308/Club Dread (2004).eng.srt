2
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,733
I can't believe
you invited that guy.

3
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,738
He's such a bloody wanker.

4
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,161
Oh, cut it out, Rolo. God!
Why are you always makin' fun of him?

5
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:23,179
Give me a break. Sissy Brit.

6
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:25,740
- Who the hell talks like that?

7
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:28,911
- You're such a jerk, Rolo.
- You're gonna love this shit.

8
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:31,469
Pure Costa Rica Freaka.

9
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:33,678
- Ow!
- Hey, Stacy...

10
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,978
while I torch this baby,
how about you lick my chest?

11
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:39,946
Oh.

12
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:56,498
- Hey, what about my nipples?
- Shut up! Someone's watching us.

13
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:59,598
A peeper, huh?
My kind of guy.

14
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,214
- Rolo, I'm serious. It creeped me out.
- All right, all right.

15
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:05,293
I know a place more private...

16
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:08,529
- and romantic.
- Oh.

17
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,248
Ow!

18
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,053
Check it out.

19
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:19,380
- What do you think?
- Ooh!

20
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,682
Should we be doin' this here?

21
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:24,781
I mean, isn't this, like,
sacred or something?

22
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:27,252
What? No, they're dead.

23
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,278
You got any objections, Ricky?

24
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:36,171
I think you should give it to her, senor.

25
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:41,456
There he is again.

26
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:45,169
This guy's gonna be
picking his teeth out of my dump.

27
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,504
Stacy, this guy doesn't even have teeth.

28
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,019
Watch the hair, asshole!

29
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:09,809
- Goddamn monkeys.

30
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,245
Oh, my God!

31
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:19,855
Who needs a love potion?
I whipped up something extra tasty.

32
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,419
Ow!

33
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,893
So, where are we gonna do this?

34
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,324
I don't wanna get caught
in the middle of a cemetery.

35
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,515
Let's at least go inside
that old mausoleum.

36
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:35,597
Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,155
- Wow.

38
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,172
- Wow.
- Check this out.

39
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,333
Oh. Looks like
we don't need you anymore.

40
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,303
What the--

41
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,362
It was probably just the wind.

42
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:16,373
Okay, we're back in.

43
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,445
- Whoo!

44
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,452
Heads or tails?

45
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:25,104
- Mmm... heads.
- Oh!

46
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:30,869
- What's "tails"?
- You don't wanna know.

47
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,621
What is it? Too waxy?

48
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,247
Shh. I heard something.

49
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,166
Was it, um,
a strange sucking sound?

50
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,172
Oh!

51
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,581
Say, what do you think about smacking
me in the face a couple of times?

52
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:56,075
Not hard.
Well, kinda hard.

53
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:57,939
What do you say?

54
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,617
- No.
- Oh, come on.

55
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,606
- No!
- Oh, come on, Kelly.

56
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,125
- It's not like I'm asking you
to eat my crap.
- No!

57
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:09,679
-Just slug me.

58
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,998
- Over here!
- No, this way!

59
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:47,373
All right. Here we go.

60
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:08,654
Welcome to Pleasure Island!
I'm your host, Coconut Pete.

61
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,404
Put your bags down and meet me
at the pool for a nice drink.

62
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:14,773
Are you ready
for the time of your life?

63
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,494
Yeah, fiesta time!
Are you ready to party?

64
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,611
-!Buenos dias! Lars Brunckhorst.
- Right this way, my friend.

65
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,745
- Welcome to the island.
Please, keep walking.
- Listen, I--

66
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:33,622
Are you ready to party?
Come on, now!

67
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,924
Party!
Who'd like to party?

68
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,426
- Hey, Lars Brunckhorst.
- Time to party. Welcome to the party.

69
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:46,645
- Lars Brunckhorst.
- Follow the officer.
Just follow the officer.

70
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:48,883
- Follow the officer. Follow the officer.
- You don't understand--

71
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:52,661
Whoo-hoo! Welcome
to Coconut Pete's Pleasure Island!

72
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,378
Now, you are here to have fun.

73
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,968
If you choose not to have fun,
fun will be provided for you.

74
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:03,444
Whoo-hoo!

75
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:06,064
All right, let's go have some fun
now, huh? Bring it down. Bring it down.

76
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:09,102
- Left, right! Left, right!
- Hey, General. Lars Brunckhorst. Listen--

77
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,078
- Nice fuckin' hat, pussy!
- Hey, you got that bag of grass
I loaned you?

78
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:15,217
Ooh, sorry. You know how it is.

79
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,207
Let me know
when you score some more.

80
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:19,922
Ooh!

81
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:28,403
Hey, you. I'm sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

82
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:31,406
Yeah, all right. Go on.

83
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:35,985
Who wants drinks?
Drinks, drinks, drinks.

84
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:38,030
- Yeah, I like that!
- Bring it on!

85
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,407
Hey, Dave. Hey, Carlos.

86
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:48,018
- Hola, Kelly.
- Think you could put a little
something ex-tra in my drinks?

87
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,160
I know ex-actly what you need.

88
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,948
- There you go.

89
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:56,627
If anyone else is eager
to share the ex-perience...

90
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:58,801
I'll be around this e-vening...

91
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:01,938
- and we'll be ex-pecting them.
- Okay, okay, okay. I get it.

92
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,016
Put it on my tab.

93
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,542
- Hey, at least give me
one of those margaritas.
- Sorry.

94
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:09,648
They're so spoken for.

95
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,727
We're gonna go for a quick romp
in the jungle before the pool party.

96
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,929
Oh, I don't know, Stace.

97
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:21,617
I have to play tennis soon,
and, well, to be honest...

98
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:25,430
that stretch of the jungle gives me an
extraordinary case of the wonky britches.

99
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,082
Sweet Jesus,
you're an F-cake, Putman.

100
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,094
- What the hell?

101
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,470
You were just telling me
what a nut-cup this guy is.

102
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,023
I did not!

103
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:38,127
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

104
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,305
- your host and rock and roll's
favorite son...

105
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,296
Coconut Pete!

106
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:48,083
Welcome to Pleasure Island!

107
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:51,185
Whoo-hoo!

108
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,413
I love you, Coconut Pete!

109
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:10,361
Oh! Well l, I guess
you all heard this one, huh?

110
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:16,662
- Back you go, dickweed!

111
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,609
I guess you also know
that I took this song and turned it...

112
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:22,705
into a beautiful reality.

113
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:26,584
- This gorgeous group of people
behind me is our staff.

114
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:30,390
And they're here to take care of you
in more ways than one!

115
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:34,932
Now, you came here to
escape civilization...

116
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,942
and we're gonna hold you to it.

117
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:39,415
Your cell phones won't work here.
There are no fax machines...

118
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,862
and most importantly of all,
no strings attached!

119
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:53,015
Coconut Pete, you're under arrest!

120
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:55,120
What are the charges, officer?

121
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:58,225
For keeping these people from enjoying
free drinks at the pool from noon to 3:.00!

122
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,363
- That would be a crime!

123
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:04,214
Well, you heard the man.
Free drinks at the pool!

124
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:06,201
Last one in
is a rotten coconut!

125
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:46,162
- Are you all right?

126
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:50,094
Yeah. That thing just scared me a little.

127
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:53,201
It's just Welkie, the Welcome Gorilla.

128
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:56,786
These two idiots were trying to hump him,
so I thought I'd stash him out here.

129
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,061
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Penelope.

130
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:01,049
I'm a little lost.

131
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:04,309
You look familiar.
Have you ever been here before?

132
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,580
Oh, yeah. Um, well, no.

133
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,137
Huh.
So where are you from?

134
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:12,308
- Uh, Nome, Alaska?
- Hmm.

135
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,962
I guess you just have
one of those faces.

136
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:18,065
-Just take a right up there
to get to the big path.

137
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,853
But you better hurry.
You'll miss the drinks by the pool.

138
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,773
Oh, Manny,
look at the chassis on this one.

139
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,784
Oh, dude.
Wanna get nailed?

140
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,930
Hot dudes lookin'
for some gander juice.

141
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,139
Yeah!

142
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:36,538
- Okay, maybe later. Yeah.
- I'll get back to you.

143
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:39,569
Oh, dude, look at that one, dude.
Green bikini? Oh, dude.

144
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,583
- Look at that little cheetah.
- Hair pie.

145
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,050
-Jackie O'Tripod.
- Dude, what--

146
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,699
Oh, dude, check out that
orange bikini, dude.

147
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:58,071
Oh, dude, come on.

148
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,243
- Do you want to be drilled by Manny?

149
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,583
Bogey. Bogey.

150
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,625
- 12:00 noon.
- Holy shit, dude.

151
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,178
I know that chick.
That's the chick on that TV show--

152
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:11,249
- A.M. Pump Up With Amy Aerobics.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

153
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,012
She's the one in the way back.

154
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,417
Dude, she was. But then the chick
by the palm tree died...

155
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:18,296
so she got promoted to palm tree.

156
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,467
And then Amy Aerobics died, and so
she's the new number one chick, dude.

157
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,571
- She's the new Amy Aerobics!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Amy Aerobics died?

158
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:27,123
- What did she die of?
- She didn't die of a fat ass,
I'll tell you that, bro.

159
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:32,242
What's up?
Dude, don't be gay, man.

160
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,256
- I don't think so.
- Hi.

161
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,402
Oh! Whoo! Hey.

162
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:39,289
- Lars Brunckhorst. I'm the new masseur.
- Hi.

163
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,275
- I'm Jenny.
- Really nice to meet you, Jenny.

164
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,429
- And this is Yu.
- And really nice to meet you, Yu.

165
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,865
- So you’re subbing in for Inga this week?

166
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:50,329
- Yeah.
- Well, you'd better be good.

167
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:53,012
Inga had some great moves.
Let's see what you got.

168
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,838
Ooh.

169
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:05,369
Oh, God.
Inga never did anything like that.

170
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:07,571
- Who's the fucking hippie?
- I'll take that.

171
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,585
Hey, get your own margy.

172
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:14,296
- It's not for me.
It's for our new masseur, Lars.
- Are you serious?

173
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,948
We swapped out a six-foot
Swedish broad for this guy?

174
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,938
- I'm six-one.
- Cool!

175
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:21,173
Oh, don't worry about him.

176
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:24,406
He's Coconut Pete's nephew, so he
thinks he can get away with murder.

177
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,612
At least assault
with a deadly wet one.

178
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,854
- Who wants to limbo?
- Limbo! Limbo!

179
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,883
I'll show you the ropes
at the club tonight.

180
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:40,053
Look for me.
I'll be the cute chick behind the bar.

181
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,834
Attention: Frankie back to Hollywood!

182
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,484
- Dude, whatever.
- Dude, this is you! This is you!

183
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:53,107
- Bend it, don't break it.
- I'll bend anything. I'm gettin'
so fuckin' laid tonight.

184
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:15,771
Yeah, drink, sugar! Chug it down!

185
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,809
Chug it down for me!

186
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,988
Hey, what's up there,
you foxes and cockses?

187
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,709
Here comes Coconut Pete!

188
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,948
Hey, am I go. You must be Lars.

189
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:33,208
Coconut Pete. Hey, man, I really appreciate
you bringing me into your life circle.

190
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,893
Pleasure's all mine. Say, I hear
good things about your fingers.

191
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,701
Is that a tranquility blouse?

192
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:42,224
Yeah, it is. It's actually the same one
you wore on your album cover.

193
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:45,201
"Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations"?

194
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:47,216
I read a 1977 interview
where you said that...

195
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,689
the teal and blue really kept
you focused during the tough times.

196
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:52,854
That sounds like something
I said back in '77.

197
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,865
I guess nobody told you, but, uh...

198
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,208
you're supposed to wear
the Pleasure Sweater on luge duty.

199
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:59,991
Oh, yeah, they did, but it's actually
kind of hot in here...

200
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,979
and it was kind of
wadded up on the ground--

201
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:05,110
Just put the goddamn thing on.
Hank, give Lars a hand, will ya?

202
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,153
Oh, yeah.

203
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:13,204
- Thanks, Hank.
- Hey, Coco Pete, I have
a present for you, my friend.

204
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,722
- You see the beautiful flower
in the yellow dress?
- Mmm!

205
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:18,868
She's in full bloom.

206
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:22,452
She said she saw you in Tucson
three years ago, 14th row.

207
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:30,714
Excuse me, but weren't you
at one of my shows?

208
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:33,146
U of A, '99?

209
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,383
- Yeah!
- I remember you! You were in the--

210
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:39,029
Don't tell me-- 15th row.

211
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,736
- Fourteenth row!
- I have a pictographic memory
for pretty faces.

212
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,771
Well, hey, how about the grand tour?

213
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:49,658
- Yeah, sure.
- Right this way.

214
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,418
Hey, buddy!

215
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,451
Ah, Jesus Christ!
That's tequila!

216
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:02,102
I was doubles partners
with Andre Agassi for an entire week.

217
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:05,018
I'm the one who taught 'Dre
to play Cocks and Quarters.

218
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:09,045
If you can believe it,
he'd never played Cocks and Quarters.

219
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:11,701
Wow. That's interesting.

220
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,844
- Yeah, it's-- Well, it's--
- Hey, snow bunny!

221
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:16,053
- Give me a Drambuie, neat.
- You got it.

222
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:20,465
Well, all alone, huh? Well, don't worry.
"No woman, no cry," right, mon?

223
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:24,085
Actually, I was quite engaged
until you bullied your way in here.

224
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,937
Yeah, I heard you. Something about, uh,
Cocks and Quarters?

225
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:30,298
You know, we have that game in the States
too, except we call it Hide the Sausage.

226
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:34,074
I beg your pardon? Excuse me,
new fellow, please cut off this minor.

227
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,889
Oh, come on! If there’s grass
on the field, then play ball.

228
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:39,836
Right, guv'nor?
Hey, Sammy, hit me!

229
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:45,848
Mmm!
Gracias, Sheriff.

230
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:47,924
Legalize it!

231
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:53,113
Hey, late night fun
at the campfire in one hour.

232
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:56,344
- And don't forget your condoms.
- Tequila! Who wants some?

233
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:59,346
Hey, what, are you dancing alone?
Hey, sweetie. Come here.

234
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:01,110
- Hi!

235
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:05,304
Whoo! I now pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. Funzy!

236
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,740
You owe me one, bro.

237
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,652
Uh, may I kiss the bride?

238
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:13,978
- Um... do you work here?
- I do.

239
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:17,622
I'm Juan Castillo.
I am dive master.

240
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,896
Like, cliffs, or-or--

241
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:24,504
Cliffs, rocks, boards.
Whatever you wish.

242
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:28,467
Oh, that is a beautiful name.
"Peenalop."

243
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:31,988
Peenalop.
It's breathtaking.

244
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:35,027
Um, thank you.

245
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:39,093
So, tell me, what brings you
here to us, Peenalop?

246
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:43,058
Oh, oh. I'm on spring break.
I go to Oral Roberts.

247
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:46,961
Oral Roberts?
Is that anything like an Anal Johnson?

248
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,589
'Cause, well,
I've done that a few times.

249
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:54,646
Or am I thinking of a Dirty Sanchez?
That's the one.

250
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:59,288
- I don't know what that is.
- Uh... it's not for you.

251
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,553
- Oh, my God!
- Ah, yes.

252
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,726
A very magical place.

253
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:23,228
- Hey.
- Hey, Carlos.

254
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:25,845
Make it quick.
We got a lot of dishes.

255
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,794
Goddamn monkeys.

256
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,326
- You?

257
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,074
Carlos, these knives are filthy.
When are you gonna clean 'em?

258
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,028
Manana.

259
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:04,697
One, two! One, two, three, four!

260
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,699
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

261
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,972
- All right!
- Solid.

262
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,142
Play "Margaritaville."

263
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,490
Excuse me?

264
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,267
Play "Margaritaville."
I love that song.

265
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:49,781
Darlin', I think you're referrin'
to my song "Pina Coladaburg."

266
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:52,472
No, "Margaritaville."

267
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:57,908
I think you mean "Pina Coladaburg."

268
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:01,178
A little song I wrote
seven and a half fucking years...

269
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:04,028
before "Margaritaville"
was even on the map!

270
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:07,225
Of course,
you wouldn't know that 'cause...

271
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,214
you weren't even born yet!

272
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,219
- Come on, hog shell. Let's get us a drink.

273
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:13,214
- I don't need this shit.
- Come on, man.

274
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,252
Fuck that guy!
Son of a son of a bitch!

275
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:18,620
Mothermotherfucker!

276
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:21,533
- Hey, Jenny.

277
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,556
- God!
- Sorry.

278
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:28,662
Give me a heads-up
before you do that.

279
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:32,062
It's just a habit. I could see
how tight you were from a mile away.

280
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,133
What can I say?
Some girls are just tighter than others.

281
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,068
- Sorry.

282
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:43,127
Uh-- So, uh, I guess
I'm talkin' to a celebrity.

283
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,823
Congratulations.
I heard you got your own fitness show?

284
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:49,017
Uh, yeah. Amy Aerobics
accidentally ate some rat poison.

285
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,224
It was awful.

286
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:54,556
But I'm still really psyched.
I've been waiting a long time for this.

287
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,924
- That's great.
- Hey, Jen.

288
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:01,304
I will be glad to never
have to do this again.

289
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:03,294
Yeah, it must be tough
living in paradise.

290
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,812
Oh, yeah.
You love it now, but just wait.

291
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,100
Hey, you guys ever hear the story
of the Machete Maniac?

292
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:17,467
Ooh!

293
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:19,389
Let's hear it.

294
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:22,301
Yeah, I don't know.
It's probably too scary for you guys.

295
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:26,425
- No. No, it's not.
- No, come on, Dave.
Please, tell us the story.

296
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:29,210
All right, what the hell.

297
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:32,027
This must've been, like,
15 years ago, you know?

298
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:35,443
We had a kid working at the club
named Phil Coletti.

299
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:39,610
And one night--
it was a night a lot like tonight--

300
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:43,126
this gorgeous woman comes
into the club, asks him if he
wants to go out to the jungle.

301
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,435
He's like, "Yeah. Why not?'"

302
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:48,950
So they split. And as they started
getting out to the jungle...

303
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:52,535
further and further away
from the lights of the club...

304
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,778
she starts asking him
these questions, like...

305
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:58,556
does he believe
in the local legends of the island...

306
00:23:58,655 --> 00:24:01,044
voodoo, zombies.

307
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:04,566
He's not too worried about it.

308
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:06,613
He just rolls right over,
starts putting the screws to her.

309
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,909
But something doesn't
feel right to Coletti.

310
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,782
But he can't see shit. It's pitch black,
so he just keeps bangin' away.

311
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,985
But then, boom!

312
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:21,527
A flash of lightning lights up the
whole island, and in that one moment...

313
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:26,236
Coletti looks around and sees
not only is he out in the middle
of that old Mayan cemetery...

314
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:30,394
not only are all the other guys from
the resort standing around watching him...

315
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:33,594
but he sees that
he's having sex with a corpse.

316
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,367
A cold, white...

317
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:40,984
- dirty-from-the-grave dead body.

318
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:43,737
And they say...

319
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,417
Phil Coletti calmly walked
to the groundskeeper's shack...

320
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,275
found a machete...

321
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:52,855
and chopped those staff members
into a hundred pieces.

322
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,590
And they say
he took that same machete...

323
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,754
chopped his own dick off
and ran screaming into the jungle.

324
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:05,051
Nobody ever saw him after that.

325
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,191
But from that point on...

326
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:10,645
Phil Coletti was forever known...

327
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:13,173
as Machete Phil.

328
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,589
Are you telling me there's some
totally deranged, dickless dude
running around out there?

329
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:21,340
All I 'm saying is I don't
go into the jungle alone if I can help it.

330
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,822
'Cause you can hear him,
and I've heard him...

331
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:27,611
crying out...

332
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:31,574
"Where's my penis?

333
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,349
Where's my penis?
Where's my penis??'

334
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,936
- And that boy was me!

335
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:52,924
You're an asshole,
Putman.

336
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:57,594
- Anybody get laid tonight?
- Hey, Pete.

337
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,835
- I know I did.

338
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:02,108
Say, anybody seen
Rolo, Stacy or Kelly?

339
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,247
They're probably off screwing around
in the jungle somewhere.

340
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:07,254
Well, shit. I'm gonna need somebody
to run Luau Night tomorrow.

341
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:10,780
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll run Luau Night.

342
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,335
What, cut up a couple
of pineapples, whatever.

343
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,091
- Yeah, great.
Sam, will you run Luau Night?
- Sure. Can do.

344
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,974
We'll get some grass mini-skirts,
maybe have a poi-eating contest...

345
00:26:19,072 --> 00:26:21,276
and, uh, everyone'll get laid.

346
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:24,343
- Sounds great. People, please.

347
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,132
Is it too much to ask?
Have sex with the guests.

348
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,688
- Some of 'em aren't bad-looking.

349
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,476
Hola, Peenalop!

350
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,181
Change!

351
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:20,350
- All right, 200 points. 200 points.
- Oh, good Christ!

352
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,067
Oh, you're dead, fucker!
You little yellow prick!

353
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,169
You're fucked!

354
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:27,866
- Ohh!
- 500 points!

355
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:32,093
- Fuckin' worked!
- A simple tag would have sufficed.

356
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:34,910
Eat it, fuck-nut!

357
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:38,009
- Cue Pretzel.

358
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:40,023
Where's Pretzel?

359
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:44,057
Come on. Cue Pretzel.
Cue Pretzel. Pretzel-- Ah.

360
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:47,995
Pretzel!

361
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:51,512
Hey, Pretzel!
Get your twisted, salty ass out here.

362
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:54,846
- Hey!

363
00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:02,169
Ocupado, bro. Go!

364
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,423
Sorry, Cliff.
I need you in the maze.

365
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:15,416
- I'm on break.
- Be happy in your work, Pear.

366
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:18,075
Shit.

367
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,542
Eh, yeah.
Hey, look, I salty, yeah?

368
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:26,649
- Wait. What's your name?
- Listen, mami,
I call you later, all right?

369
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:29,820
- Bye.

370
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,577
- Shit!

371
00:29:56,674 --> 00:30:00,253
- I got you!

372
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:15,351
Whoa!

373
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:38,715
Huh?

374
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,753
- Hello?

375
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:22,527
Hello?

376
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:40,344
- Lars?
- Huh?

377
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,346
Oh. Sorry.
I was just in the middle of my Qi Kung.

378
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,622
Wow. Qi Kung?

379
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:49,821
- Whoa!
- I should have you on my show.

380
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:52,476
- I guess you're not
just into massage, are you?
- Yeah, well--

381
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,994
I mean, bodywork's still my life,
but I've also done the Dianetic thing.

382
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,757
Spent a little time in the Forum.

383
00:31:57,858 --> 00:32:00,541
Did a little Falun Gong in Bang Chow.

384
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,781
- But you know who’s got
a great philosophy?
- Who?

385
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:04,955
Coconut Pete.

386
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,881
Have a good time all the time.

387
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:09,183
- Always eat the worm.
- Totally.

388
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:12,894
- Sign our asses! Sign our asses!
- Sign our asses!

389
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:15,580
- What do you know about Feng Chi?
- Um, nothing.

390
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:20,571
- Snoring Panda.

391
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:23,196
Not to be confused
with Linou Gano...

392
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,022
- the Leaking Turtle.
- Oh, my God!

393
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:27,742
- Don't try that in public.
- Dude!

394
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:29,752
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
send you back over there.

395
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:32,859
- You'll get plenty
of signatures, all right?
- Come on, hop.

396
00:32:32,963 --> 00:32:35,384
Go ahead.

397
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,465
- Come on, hop!
- That's amazing.

398
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:39,611
It's all really about
connecting your meridians.

399
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:42,497
We all have energy that flows through
us, and it's all connected by buttons.

400
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:44,984
So, what other buttons
can you push?

401
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,425
Tian-Tu.

402
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:50,872
- The Heaven Point.

403
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:54,973
Fuck me!

404
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:58,141
Damn!

405
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,479
Maybe I should
take you home with me.

406
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:04,223
I don't know if
I'd fit in your luggage. Oh, shit!

407
00:33:04,324 --> 00:33:07,585
What the--
Oh, my God!

408
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:09,788
- Carlos?
- What's he doin' up in the air?

409
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,160
- It's gonna be okay, dude.
- I'm not getting a pulse.

410
00:33:14,531 --> 00:33:16,800
"Naughty Carlos'"?

411
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:21,593
Who's driving the boat?

412
00:33:23,204 --> 00:33:25,112
You really never played
this game as a kid?

413
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:29,049
We had a cheap
Nicaraguan version called Circle Eater.

414
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:32,537
- But, you know--

415
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,676
Are you trying to tell us something, boy?
Is Timmy trapped in a well?

416
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,819
Come on!

417
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:40,509
- You must come quick!
- Follow the banana!

418
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,722
- Oh!

419
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Oh, man!

420
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:51,680
Cliff!.

421
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,535
Oh!

422
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:04,475
Who would do something like this?

423
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,969
I mean, who the fuck would wanna
come here and do something like this?

424
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:10,873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on. Settle down, now.

425
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:13,826
- You're makin' a scene.
- There's a bloody killer on the island.

426
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:18,146
I know who it is. It's Machete Phil,
come out from the jungle.

427
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:20,513
Cool it, Juanny. You know that's
just a bullshit story for the guests.

428
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:23,262
Hey, it looks like
everybody else is okay.

429
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:26,233
But you gotta see what
someone did to my activities board.

430
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,957
- Oh, my God!

431
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:40,096
"Do your jobs and live.

432
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:42,335
Tell the guests and die'"?

433
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:44,410
""Cause everybody's looking
to find their own paradise."'

434
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,102
What the hell does that mean?

435
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:50,816
- We have to get off the island.
- We have to get everyone off the island.

436
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:13,084
Ahh! Okay.

437
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:16,865
Okay, the radio's smashed,
and we got no boats.

438
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:19,779
- No boats?
- How could somebody steal both boats?

439
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,786
I don't know. I--
I mean, the Smilin' Smuggler...

440
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:24,063
Looked like it was
just driving around on its own.

441
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,335
- What? On its own?
- And that phone line
had definitely been cut?

442
00:35:26,436 --> 00:35:28,541
It sure as shit was not
chewed up by jungle rats.

443
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:32,092
- We have jungle rats?
- Okay, what are we gonna tell the guests?

444
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,139
- Nothing. I mean, you saw the board.
- He's right.

445
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:37,147
We tell the guests there's some crazed
maniac on the island with no way off?

446
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:39,837
We're gonna have a hundred
crazed maniacs running around.

447
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,788
What about the sign on Cliff?
I mean, it clearly said, "staff only."

448
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:44,795
I mean, that means
he's targeting us.

449
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:47,268
- I don't understand.

450
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,699
Why are they coming after us?

451
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:58,553
Ahhh.

452
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,719
When you're all done with your little
pink panty meltdown let me know...

453
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:04,893
'cause I'd like to
get down to business.

454
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:09,274
I thought it was time
to bring in the pro.

455
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,584
- Hank?
- Yes, Hank.

456
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:14,652
- The head of security on all my tours.
- So, what?

457
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,539
He keeps aging hippies from stealing
the bong out of your tour bus?

458
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:20,190
It just so happens
Hank used to be a federal agent.

459
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:24,351
Yeah, that's right. Headed
an F.B.I. task force on serial killers.

460
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:27,552
Single-handedly caught
the Minneapolis Mangler.

461
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,882
- Who's the Minneapolis Mangler?
- Exactly.

462
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,664
Pete, you are aware that
I personally have served this guy...

463
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:36,416
twenty beers a day
for the last 10 years, right?

464
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:38,621
Hey, I was in Nicaragua, junior!

465
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:41,113
When you can stuff
your intestines back in your pockets...

466
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,130
and walk 20 klicks to an aid station...

467
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:46,717
after a knife fight with guerrilla
drug lords, then you talk to me.

468
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:52,161
All right, since there's
no way off this rock...

469
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:54,716
- we're gonna have to catch this guy.
- Catch him?

470
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,985
We couldn't even catch the bloody
raccoon that was stealing
my wristbands last month.

471
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,500
You didn't ask me to catch
the raccoon, did you, Pip?

472
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,892
All right, now here's the plan.

473
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:08,062
You're gonna give this wing nut
exactly what he wants.

474
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:11,743
- You're all gonna do your jobs.
- All right, then tell us something.

475
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,266
How the hell are we
supposed to do our job...

476
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:17,308
when somebody is killing the dick
out of everybody on the island?

477
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:20,096
- Take it easy there, menstrual cramp.

478
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:23,842
You read the poem
on that board out there.

479
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,396
I seen this a million times.

480
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:29,797
This guy's playing a game,
and we're gonna play right back.

481
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:33,439
Just keep cool,
and this cat'll come to us.

482
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,028
And when he does,
I promise you...

483
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:39,745
I'll be there
with my whompin' stick.

484
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,906
Come on, hit it!
Hit it!

485
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:53,053
Definitely not this guy.

486
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:55,578
Maybe. Maybe not.

487
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:58,074
What in the queen's wig
is going on here?

488
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:01,051
We've got a killer on the loose, and
you're throwing a bloody pinata party.

489
00:38:01,157 --> 00:38:04,670
The cut on that pear kid
was left to right.

490
00:38:04,773 --> 00:38:08,351
Left to right! I'm looking
for the left-handed killer, you idiot!

491
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,176
Oh. I see.

492
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:20,869
This is totally fucked up.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

493
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,038
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

494
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:27,388
Hey, you know, I've been thinking
about that poem on the board.

495
00:38:27,494 --> 00:38:30,396
There's something
really familiar about those words.

496
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:33,022
I just can't seem to
wrap my fingers around it.

497
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,973
- Can you wrap your fingers around this?
- Whoa!

498
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:44,964
- Hi, Juan.
- Hi. Uh--

499
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:48,029
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. I made you a hat.

500
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,555
Oh. I-I don't know what to say.

501
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,182
Well, say "thank you" and put it on.

502
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:56,155
All right, all right.

503
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:58,334
Thank you. I-I love it.

504
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:00,477
You wanna take a walk on the beach?

505
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:03,397
Eh--

506
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:06,308
You know,
it's the same here as it is down there.

507
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:10,400
You know, um, the sand and water here,
the sand and water--

508
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:18,879
I heard you were being
very bad today Juan.

509
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,121
What you mean?

510
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:23,742
When you were
supposed to be in the maze...

511
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:26,398
you were eating watermelon.

512
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:30,692
- How you find out about that?
- Because I see everything, Juan.

513
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:40,316
Hey, you-you know--
you know what? You know what?

514
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:45,507
I think it's a good idea if we were
to go down the beach a little more far.

515
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:49,697
- Huh? The two of us.
- Okay.

516
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:58,342
Oh, you know, I forgot.

517
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:01,340
I'm supposed
to go make S'mores.

518
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:09,120
- We checked every guest cabana.
- No weapons? No bloody clothes?

519
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:11,109
Just pornography and
an ass-load of condoms.

520
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,028
The guy in 14
had a wooden Bible.

521
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:15,036
A wooden Bible, huh?
That's good.

522
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:17,116
That's a good job.
All right now, Jenny.

523
00:40:17,223 --> 00:40:19,524
You go check on Yu. She's freakin' out.

524
00:40:19,622 --> 00:40:21,596
New meat, you take over here.

525
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,599
Okay? Break!

526
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,744
Okay? Break!

527
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:26,716
- You'll be all right?
- Yeah.

528
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:28,764
Sure.

529
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:37,695
- Shite. Shite. Not her best.

530
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:40,003
Hello, Pete.

531
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:43,936
"Hope They've Got Hammocks
in Heaven."

532
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:47,458
Great.

533
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:50,461
And again, Peter.

534
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:53,054
You dirty bugger.

535
00:40:59,462 --> 00:41:01,666
What's this?

536
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:08,382
Jesus, this is crazy!
We can't do this anymore!

537
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:10,494
Quiet, Yu.
The guests will hear.

538
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:13,021
Jenny, we cannot act like
there's nothing wrong, okay?

539
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:15,135
There are guests everywhere.
We have to tell them.

540
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,857
No! You saw that board.

541
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:30,179
So I said it's totally tea bag season.

542
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:32,384
Dude, shut up, gay-rod. Give me a light.

543
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:35,204
Hey, guys, I 'm gonna need you
back at the bonfire. We're
gonna make an announcement.

544
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:37,824
Oh, good, 'cause I got
an announcement to make to Roy.

545
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:41,375
- I'm totally bake-ached.
- Come on!

546
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,845
- Idiots.

547
00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:47,358
- Hey, come to the beach.

548
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,212
We're gonna make
an announcement.

549
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:55,877
Help!

550
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:57,600
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

551
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,604
Help!

552
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:16,355
There's always one fuck-head like you...

553
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:18,342
trying to shit in the apple pie.

554
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:23,166
You just shat in the one apple pie
that knows how to shit back.

555
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,749
So why don't, uh, you and me,
let's just--

556
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:32,001
- Oh, God!

557
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,007
Oh, my God!

558
00:42:46,535 --> 00:42:48,772
Shit!

559
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:57,412
Shit!

560
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:15,836
Amy's got some fantastic advice for
everybody this morning, haven't you, Amy?

561
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:19,522
Here are humans,
here is God, and here are we.

562
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:21,827
You're the girl, Ame!

563
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,993
Shoulders down.

564
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,943
- How are we looking, Dr. Wick?
- You're looking fantastic, Amy.

565
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,308
Looking fantastic.
This is one of the top five cardio--

566
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:05,768
Let's do the sun salute!

567
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,486
Let's do the sun salute!

568
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:11,845
Crab, crab, crab.
Shot. Throw it away. Salute.

569
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:14,758
Crab, crab, crab.
Shot. Throw it away. Salute.

570
00:44:14,856 --> 00:44:17,955
Hey, let's dance.
It's easier when you're smiling.

571
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:21,055
- I heard one of our ski boats last night.
- Holy shit! That's great!

572
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,135
- I only heard it for a second, but--
- So what do we do?

573
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,477
If it is one of ours, this guy's got it.
It's probably not a real good idea...

574
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:28,512
to go lookin' for it unless you
want to get your dingy chopped off.

575
00:44:28,616 --> 00:44:30,655
- What?

576
00:44:34,023 --> 00:44:38,464
Hey, I figured it out. I know where
those lines on the board came from.

577
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:42,245
You know that line, "Everyone's
looking to find their own paradise"?

578
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:45,443
- That's from one of your songs.
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
One of my songs?

579
00:44:45,544 --> 00:44:49,156
Yeah, it's off your album
"Sea Shanties and Wet Panties. '"

580
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:52,868
- 1978?
- Let's see those pinchers, people!

581
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:55,238
What does this song
have to do with all this?

582
00:44:55,336 --> 00:44:57,606
The name of the song
is "Naughty Cal."

583
00:44:57,704 --> 00:45:00,639
- Naughty Cliff. Naughty Carlos.
- Naughty Cal!

584
00:45:18,184 --> 00:45:20,421
- Shit.

585
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,888
That's the line that was
on the board yesterday.

586
00:45:29,704 --> 00:45:31,559
I didn't know
where it was from.

587
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:34,144
How do you not know
the words to your own song?

588
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:37,926
I don't even remember
making the album, okay?

589
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:41,855
Shit, it was '78.
We were all out of our gourds.

590
00:45:41,961 --> 00:45:45,790
It was kind of a crazy time in 1978.

591
00:45:45,897 --> 00:45:48,679
Oh, man, we had
some fuckin' parties.

592
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:00,230
- "High as a kite"?

593
00:46:00,328 --> 00:46:03,296
"He fell and cracked his shell"?
That's like Carlos up in the parasail.

594
00:46:04,776 --> 00:46:08,289
Then "lost in a maze,"
exactly like Cliff.

595
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:14,336
So this guy is killing people
according to a fucking acid trip song?

596
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,383
- This is insane!
- Peter.

597
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:21,279
What's the song about? I s there
some sort of special significance?

598
00:46:21,385 --> 00:46:23,524
Fuck no. I mean, uh,
I don't know.

599
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:27,880
It's a sea shanty. Naughty Cal's
this, uh, underwater cowboy...

600
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:29,864
and Tokey and Bongo
are his buddies.

601
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:32,809
And they go on this adventure
to find, uh, Atlantis or some shit.

602
00:46:32,905 --> 00:46:37,030
- I-I-I--
- Let's listen to the next line
and see what happens.

603
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:44,421
Maybe if I play it backwards.

604
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,617
- Wait, listen. Listen.

605
00:46:58,377 --> 00:47:01,344
- So, what the hell?
The orca and the octopus?

606
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:04,167
I mean, is it
the next victims, or is it the killer?

607
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:07,910
Our lives depend on us interpreting
the dumbest fucking song I've ever heard.

608
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,311
Please, don't hold back.
Just say what you really think.

609
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:12,165
I'm not sensitive.

610
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:14,819
You know, I won about five fucking
gold records in my lifetime.

611
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:17,158
H-How many gold records
do you have?

612
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:19,560
- Let's see how it ends.

613
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:36,514
-Jesus.

614
00:47:36,618 --> 00:47:39,432
Pete!
Yu and Hank are dead.

615
00:47:39,529 --> 00:47:41,602
- Why? What did we do?
- No, man.

616
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:44,324
Yu and Hank are fucking dead.

617
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:48,004
You threatening me? 'Cause if you are,
you little hairless lap dog--

618
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:49,992
!Ay, puta!
Just come and look!

619
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:54,818
"Don't let this be Yu. '"

620
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:58,085
She was just trying
to warn the guests.

621
00:47:58,186 --> 00:48:00,258
- Hank!

622
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:05,857
Yu?

623
00:48:19,242 --> 00:48:21,151
Why are we doing
a goddamn fashion show?

624
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:23,560
Because it's goddamn
Fashion Show Wednesday, that's why!

625
00:48:23,658 --> 00:48:27,303
Look what happened to Yu! Remember
the warning: "Do your jobs or die"?

626
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:29,312
So we're just gonna put
little smiles on our faces...

627
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:31,305
and march out there
and do our goddamn jobs.

628
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:33,987
- You got that? Lars, you're up.
Come on. Let's go.
- You got it, Pete.

629
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:40,164
Lars Brunckhorst, everybody.

630
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:43,463
Lars is sporting
the Pleasure Poncho.

631
00:48:43,562 --> 00:48:47,556
Only 19.95 at the gift shop.
Thank you, Lars.

632
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,601
I'm tellin'ya, I got a bad
feeling about that new guy.

633
00:48:49,706 --> 00:48:53,350
You are right. It all started
when he got here, didn't it?

634
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,871
- Sam, it isn't Lars or any of us.
- Look, Jenny.

635
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:58,978
- I know why you’re defending him.
- Pajamas! Come on! Move!

636
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:03,306
- Putman, pillow.
- Putman Livingston, I presume.

637
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:06,119
Oh, if it isn't
Little Lord Fauntleroy!

638
00:49:06,218 --> 00:49:08,040
Pip, pip! Tallyho!

639
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:10,473
I got it. In that song...

640
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,953
Naughty Cal sings
about the scary octopus.

641
00:49:14,058 --> 00:49:17,374
Look at Putman!
Putman is the octopus.

642
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:21,792
- Hello?
- Dave, just go play with
the curtains or something.

643
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:24,265
No, no, no. We can't dismiss
that song. What about Carlos and Cliff?

644
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:28,421
What about the fact that
Hank was buried in the sand like
the buried treasure in the song?

645
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:30,498
All right,
so maybe the octopus...

646
00:49:30,603 --> 00:49:32,577
is the way
the next person dies?

647
00:49:32,682 --> 00:49:35,137
How do you kill someone
with an octopus?

648
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:38,788
Octopus spelled backward is "supotco."
Juan, isn't that Spanish for something?

649
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:41,542
"Supotco"? No.
The word for shoe is zapato.

650
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:46,247
- Hmm. Shoe.
- Am I the only one who thinks
his head looks like an octopus?

651
00:49:46,346 --> 00:49:48,735
- Shh, shh, shh. Here he comes.
- What did I miss?

652
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:51,778
- Apparently, somebody's gonna
get killed by a shoe.
- Hmm.

653
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:55,232
Okay, you guys, instead of
focusing on the song, why don't
we go look for those boats?

654
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:59,267
- Good idea.
-Jenny, why don't you and I
go search together?

655
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,705
- Um--
- Putman.

656
00:50:01,802 --> 00:50:04,257
- Why don't you and I
go and look for that boat?
- Are you daft?

657
00:50:04,363 --> 00:50:07,679
I'm not going out in the jungle
with you and your bloody shiatsu.

658
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:10,821
If you’re the killer,
you'll snap my neck like a twig.

659
00:50:10,923 --> 00:50:14,021
All right, stick to the shore.
There's no reason to go in the jungle.

660
00:50:14,123 --> 00:50:16,806
The boats are probably
gonna be covered with sticks.

661
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:18,881
Or branches.

662
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:21,540
Thanks much, officer.

663
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,010
Aren't you taking any weapons?

664
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,180
- I have all the weapons I need.

665
00:50:26,283 --> 00:50:29,666
Piss on that.
I'm taking a machete.

666
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,226
Thanks for doing this,
Lars.

667
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,145
You're very brave.
Just be careful, all right?

668
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:48,578
Good luck, Putman.

669
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:53,888
Better believe I'll be keeping
an eye on you, Mr. Miyagi.

670
00:51:06,027 --> 00:51:10,151
I know you guys are probably
a little intimidated by
cooking for the whole resort...

671
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:13,350
but I think you’re gonna get
a big kick out of it, okay?

672
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:16,484
- I bet you watched Yu and Kelly.

673
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,075
And most of it's just common sense.
Like right now...

674
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,961
I'm making my famous
Coconut Pete's Paella.

675
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,547
Can anyone guess
the secret ingredient?

676
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:27,402
Come on.

677
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:30,150
Coconut Pete's Paella?

678
00:51:31,563 --> 00:51:33,832
The secret ingredient?

679
00:51:33,931 --> 00:51:37,227
- Coconut... Pete's--
- Eh--

680
00:51:37,323 --> 00:51:40,170
- Coconut?
- Yes, goddamn it! Yes!

681
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:45,024
Yes!

682
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:49,539
Jesus! You think Eddie Money
has to put up with this shit?

683
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:55,780
Goddamn it!
Coconut Pete's Paella!

684
00:51:57,419 --> 00:52:00,322
Jesus Christ.
What you think?

685
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:02,565
I think Pete's under
a lot of pressure.

686
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:04,642
I don't think
we can say for sure. God, I don't know.

687
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,886
- What are you doing?
- Uh, you know.

688
00:52:06,988 --> 00:52:10,087
Just, uh, hanging around,
uh, looking through the window.

689
00:52:10,187 --> 00:52:13,384
Calamari?

690
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:16,745
- Uh--
- It's an aphrodisiac, Juan.

691
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,479
- Oh. Oh!
- What's wrong?

692
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,482
You're not afraid of
a little octopus, are you?

693
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:26,530
Thank you.

694
00:52:28,267 --> 00:52:30,155
When you're done here...

695
00:52:30,252 --> 00:52:32,259
I want you to come inside
and find me...

696
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:35,396
'cause I wanna
wrap my little tentacles around you.

697
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:38,467
Okay.

698
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:47,170
- No way.

699
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,002
Think about it, the octopus.

700
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,987
Look, she's a weird little chick,
I'll give you that.

701
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:59,623
But, look, it still
doesn't prove that she's the killer.

702
00:52:59,724 --> 00:53:03,947
All right. There is only
one way to find out.

703
00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:12,837
- Don't be nervous.

704
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:18,439
Eh, I just want our first time
to be wonderful.

705
00:53:20,204 --> 00:53:23,052
So I would say that
if you’re the killer...

706
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:25,287
just, you know,
just maybe don't kill me.

707
00:53:25,388 --> 00:53:27,625
Or at least make it,
you know, painless.

708
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:29,666
With those moves of yours, I bet
you could put me down nice and easy.

709
00:53:29,772 --> 00:53:31,844
-Just, zip, and I'm out, right?
- Look.

710
00:53:31,948 --> 00:53:34,632
The whole reason we're hiding
in this closet is because
we think she's the killer.

711
00:53:34,732 --> 00:53:36,641
- Oh.
- I'm gonna bite you.

712
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:38,887
- Well, not too hard, I hope.
- I really like Juan.

713
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:41,377
I remember when we first met, I was
kinda like, "Who the fuck is this guy?

714
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:43,524
Some local guy
comin' down here and--"

715
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,104
- Mmm.

716
00:53:51,149 --> 00:53:55,142
- I haven't been entirely honest with you.
- You mean...

717
00:53:55,244 --> 00:53:58,059
you don't really go
to the Oral Roberts?

718
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:13,548
Aah!

719
00:54:13,645 --> 00:54:15,783
I mean...

720
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:20,391
I just wanted to leave
my past behind me when I came here.

721
00:54:20,492 --> 00:54:23,656
What the fuck are you,
a praying mantis woman?

722
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,828
- I--

723
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,748
I've never been
to a place like this.

724
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:34,732
I mean, it's just so free.

725
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,807
Juan, I have spent
my whole life in a gym.

726
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:43,756
I just wanted to party
like everyone else.

727
00:54:45,293 --> 00:54:48,076
My coach, Orgrav,
would kill me if he found out.

728
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:52,264
He would hunt me down
like a deranged lunatic.

729
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:56,838
- He's really scary some--
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

730
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,869
- You are a gymnast?
- Yeah.

731
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:04,104
Oh!
Gracias.

732
00:55:09,261 --> 00:55:11,814
No tushie! No! No!

733
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:39,751
I 'l I be right back.

734
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:45,220
Okay.

735
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,951
Eh, I 'm still not sure.

736
00:55:51,053 --> 00:55:54,119
I may need a few more hours
to pump her for information.

737
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:56,229
You asshole!
Now you're just trying to get laid.

738
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:58,822
How would you like to be stuffed in this
closet while I go out there and have sex?

739
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:01,772
- That is a great idea.

740
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:04,106
Shh! Here she comes!

741
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:13,196
What exactly
are your intentions with Jenny?

742
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:20,580
You know, Put...

743
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:25,159
during the Sung Dynasty, there was
a great mystic -- Master Tsu Tong Po.

744
00:56:25,261 --> 00:56:27,171
And he once said
something very wise:

745
00:56:28,845 --> 00:56:31,463
"If you love something, set it free.

746
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:33,475
- If it comes back to you--"
- Fuck off.

747
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:35,686
It's a bloody Hallmark card.

748
00:56:36,909 --> 00:56:38,797
Just trying to help you, man.

749
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:43,877
Well, she has taken
quite a fancy to you, hasn't she?

750
00:56:43,981 --> 00:56:48,138
But I have some...
ammunition of my own.

751
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:54,659
What kind of man would I be if sat
idly by while you stole her from me?

752
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:03,043
Do not underestimate me, Lars.

753
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:09,420
I know things you don't.

754
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:42,348
All right, Lars,
let's see what you got.

755
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:54,696
- Look what I found.

756
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:57,547
- Wow.
- Yeah. Shiny.

757
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:11,725
Hey.

758
00:58:16,943 --> 00:58:21,449
Oh! I knew it.

759
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:25,989
Oh, sick fuck.

760
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:29,509
Dear God in heaven.

761
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:38,886
Lars?

762
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:44,102
Oh, dear God!

763
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:10,379
No!

764
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:14,313
- No!

765
00:59:14,415 --> 00:59:17,709
- Huh?

766
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:32,361
- You!
- That's right, love.

767
00:59:32,463 --> 00:59:36,140
Now take that stupid bag
off your head and give us a kiss.

768
00:59:37,902 --> 00:59:41,481
- What?
- Advantage, Putman.

769
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:45,031
Hey--

770
00:59:45,135 --> 00:59:47,273
- Putman!

771
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,164
- Putman!

772
00:59:49,262 --> 00:59:52,678
Putman! Wake up, Putman.
It's a dream! It's just a dream, Putman.

773
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,781
Farewell.

774
01:00:06,991 --> 01:00:08,901
Keep it clean,
keep it clean, huh, mister?

775
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:11,396
That's a point!
That's a point!

776
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:13,990
!Mira! The boat!

777
01:00:19,855 --> 01:00:22,375
- Whoo!
-!Ay Mami! He found the fucking boat!

778
01:00:23,726 --> 01:00:25,832
Whoo!

779
01:00:25,935 --> 01:00:27,823
Hang on to your kudos.

780
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:32,335
- Oh!
- She's not going anywhere.

781
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:34,820
- What did you do to the propeller, man?
- I didn't do anything.

782
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:36,837
This is the one
that was pulling Carlos.

783
01:00:36,944 --> 01:00:39,399
Well, we could send a group
to paddle out to the mainland.

784
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:42,318
- We've got plenty of strong guys.
- No chance.

785
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:45,645
The riptide'll take you out to sea.

786
01:00:45,744 --> 01:00:48,613
You'll be drinking your own urine
in less than 20 hours.

787
01:00:49,904 --> 01:00:52,653
- Where's Putman?
- He's not here?

788
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:54,726
He left last night.
He ran off into the jungle.

789
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:57,482
- Oh, by "ran off'
do you mean "got killed by you"?
- Ah!

790
01:00:57,583 --> 01:01:00,879
What, did you really think we
wouldn't notice Putman was gone
if you came back with a boat?

791
01:01:00,975 --> 01:01:03,561
- Sam, that's ridiculous.
- Why is that ridiculous?

792
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:08,104
Hey, look. Putman freaked out
in the middle of the night
and took off into the jungle.

793
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,117
Look, we went into your room
last night, Lars.

794
01:01:10,224 --> 01:01:12,198
Mark David Chapman over here
has a shrine to Pete.

795
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:15,271
- It's unbelievable!
- So I'm a fan.

796
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,612
A fan?
Man, you're a fucking loon!

797
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:20,013
Look, nobody here
was killed last night...

798
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:23,210
because Lars
was in the jungle killing Putman.

799
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,701
Hey, look. I could never hurt
another person, okay?

800
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:27,913
- I don't believe in violence.
- Mm-hmm.

801
01:01:28,016 --> 01:01:29,925
I touch other people
to make them feel better.

802
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:31,248
Come on. I have an obligation
to get to the bottom of that--

803
01:01:31,248 --> 01:01:32,524
Come on. I have an obligation
to get to the bottom of that--

804
01:01:32,624 --> 01:01:36,585
-!Ay! You are the fucking Fun Police!
-Juan!

805
01:01:36,687 --> 01:01:39,109
- What the hell--
- Come on, take it easy!
Quit your bickering!

806
01:01:39,215 --> 01:01:42,477
Now, we just get through one more night,
the boat will be here tomorrow.

807
01:01:42,576 --> 01:01:45,675
We’ll be all right. So, come on,
everybody, let’s just have a drink...

808
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:49,072
- and... mellow out.
- I don't want to mellow out, Pete!

809
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:52,430
I want to know what Lars's deal
is, huh? You come here and
everyone starts getting killed.

810
01:01:52,528 --> 01:01:55,049
Hey, I don't have to tell you shit,
Fun Pig! You wanna Fun arrest me?

811
01:01:55,152 --> 01:01:57,672
You get a Fun-fucking warrant!
Until then...

812
01:01:57,776 --> 01:02:01,038
stay out of my
Fun-fucking face!

813
01:02:01,136 --> 01:02:03,111
Come on!

814
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:10,406
Jenny, you know
I'm not the killer, right?

815
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:12,421
Look, Lars,
it's not so bad in here, okay?

816
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,950
- I'll bring you some magazine.
- Yeah.

817
01:02:15,056 --> 01:02:17,161
You familiar
with the expression "sitting duck"?

818
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:19,271
No.

819
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:22,920
- You guys, this is totally fucked up.
- Look, Jenny...

820
01:02:23,023 --> 01:02:26,090
if he’s the killer,
then we have him in this room.

821
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:28,745
And if not,
then at least we know it's not him.

822
01:02:36,368 --> 01:02:40,230
Did it stink?
You bet it stunk.

823
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:43,304
Oh, shit!

824
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:46,725
- Hey, you guys gonna be
hanging around for a while?
- Totally.

825
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:50,248
We're just getting started.
Anyway, that's my mom for you.

826
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:55,941
Any of you guys
have a mother?

827
01:02:56,048 --> 01:02:58,252
Free drinks,
whoever catches me!

828
01:02:58,352 --> 01:03:00,906
- Whoo-hoo!

829
01:03:13,296 --> 01:03:15,184
Shit.

830
01:03:17,744 --> 01:03:20,046
Oh, God!

831
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:29,195
Your prayers have been answered.

832
01:03:29,297 --> 01:03:32,199
- You asshole!
- Nah, I'm not an asshole.

833
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:35,272
I'm just young, dumb and full--
What the fuck?

834
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:39,370
- What?
- Something just brushed
against my leg. What the--

835
01:03:39,472 --> 01:03:41,960
No, there's seriously
something down here.

836
01:03:42,064 --> 01:03:45,032
- What?
- Oh, no, wait!

837
01:03:45,136 --> 01:03:47,689
It's just my gigantic cock.

838
01:03:47,793 --> 01:03:50,182
Amy's got
some fantastic advice for everybody.

839
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:52,907
- Oh, my God.
- So, you want to get it on?

840
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:55,430
Dirk, get outta the pool!

841
01:03:55,536 --> 01:03:57,479
- Huh?
- I'm not kidding!

842
01:03:57,585 --> 01:04:02,025
- Hurry!
- Hey, that's what I call service!

843
01:04:02,128 --> 01:04:04,846
- Now! Get outta the pool!

844
01:04:17,713 --> 01:04:20,876
Hey, help me!

845
01:04:22,354 --> 01:04:25,965
Putman! You're alive!

846
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:28,334
- You've got your arms around me, Jenny.

847
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:31,116
I can only assume this means
every other man on the island is dead.

848
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:33,518
We got to get outta here! Dirk's dead!

849
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:35,919
He just got electrocuted in the pool!

850
01:04:36,017 --> 01:04:39,846
Really? What was the look on his face?
He must have screamed bloody murder.

851
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:42,735
You're scaring me.

852
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:46,248
I just want to know if smoke
came out of his ears. Is that so wrong?

853
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:49,485
- Hey! Oh! Putman, where have you been?

854
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:52,007
Running in circles through
this bloody jungle, that's where.

855
01:04:52,114 --> 01:04:54,154
Thank God you're not dead. Now,
we need to get over to Pete's cabana...

856
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,264
- and get that auxiliary generator.
- Wait, hang on!

857
01:04:56,368 --> 01:05:00,559
If Dirk just got killed,
then Lars couldn't be the killer!

858
01:05:03,538 --> 01:05:06,156
All right now, be on guard.
He might be a little cranky.

859
01:05:06,258 --> 01:05:08,745
Lars! Lars, we're here!

860
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:11,053
Oh, do give it a rest, Jen.

861
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:18,921
He couldn't have.

862
01:05:19,026 --> 01:05:21,262
He's far too large.

863
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:25,932
We gotta find Pete.

864
01:05:27,378 --> 01:05:30,541
- Pete!

865
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:34,154
Pete?

866
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:41,452
Pete?

867
01:05:41,554 --> 01:05:43,462
You in here, Pete?

868
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:46,766
Peter! We need the key
to the generator box.

869
01:06:03,537 --> 01:06:07,728
- Damn it!
- Isn't somebody going to get
the fuckin' door?

870
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:17,040
- Who's there?
- Who's out there?

871
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,913
- Hey!

872
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:28,588
I think there's a problem with the lights!

873
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,407
- Right?

874
01:06:31,538 --> 01:06:34,604
All right,
Lars will probably come after us here.

875
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:37,226
We don't know for sure
that it is Lars.

876
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,785
And we don't know if he got out
or if someone else got in.

877
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:43,752
What is it with you and Lars?
I'm beginning to wonder
if you aren't in cahoots!

878
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:46,444
I mean, let's see.
You had sex with Rolo, and he's dead.

879
01:06:46,546 --> 01:06:48,554
You and Cliff, right?
He's dead.

880
01:06:48,658 --> 01:06:52,270
Give me a break. I screwed Juan
and Pete, and those guys aren't dead.

881
01:06:52,371 --> 01:06:54,891
Bloody hell, Jen!
Am I the only one?

882
01:06:54,994 --> 01:06:57,296
All right, let's get back to the case.
What we have to do--

883
01:06:57,394 --> 01:07:00,111
Why don’t you drop
the bullshit cop routine, okay, Sam?

884
01:07:00,209 --> 01:07:04,007
Oh, just as soon as you drop the "I've
got nothing to hide" routine, Juan.

885
01:07:04,114 --> 01:07:08,904
Let me guess. You were in here
looking for this letter from
the Encarnacion prison facility?

886
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:12,904
- What the fuck, man?
- Fuck, why you are doing this, man?

887
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,425
"Juan shows no signs
of the bizarre and horrible behavior...

888
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,439
"that brought him to this institution.

889
01:07:18,546 --> 01:07:21,612
"We believe him to be
fully rehabilitated...

890
01:07:21,715 --> 01:07:24,714
and will be an excellent
addition to your staff."

891
01:07:24,818 --> 01:07:28,167
- What did you do, Juan?
- I did nothing, Jenny.

892
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:30,446
What the fuck did you do, man?

893
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:34,638
Costa Rican prison--
that's some hard-core anal action, man.

894
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:38,600
-Juan, we have to know.
- What did you do, Juan?
- What did you do, Juan?

895
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:41,837
- What the fuck
did you do, man, huh?
- What did you do?

896
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:44,394
- Tell us!
- I did nothing! Huh?

897
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:49,681
- El Chupacabra!

898
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:52,079
- Hey!
- No!

899
01:07:52,178 --> 01:07:55,856
- Oh! Oh, my God!

900
01:08:00,819 --> 01:08:04,528
- How could you do that?
- Wait, wait!

901
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:05,970
I did not do this. I 'm not a killer.

902
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:07,116
I did not do this. I'm not a killer.

903
01:08:07,218 --> 01:08:10,186
What the fuck, man?
Then, what is this?

904
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,363
You want to know what I did?

905
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:14,473
Huh?
You all want to know what I did?

906
01:08:16,914 --> 01:08:20,527
Juan Castillo...
went to jail...

907
01:08:20,627 --> 01:08:24,009
for having sex with a goat.

908
01:08:24,115 --> 01:08:26,962
All right?

909
01:08:27,059 --> 01:08:29,132
What you want me to say?

910
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:31,471
We lived on a farm!

911
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:33,775
And I got lonely!

912
01:08:35,379 --> 01:08:37,681
We were--

913
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:41,356
Oh, we were just
a couple of stupid kids.

914
01:08:41,459 --> 01:08:43,914
No, it wasn’t Juan.

915
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,124
It was Dave...

916
01:08:46,226 --> 01:08:48,114
wasn't it?

917
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:51,245
You hated him
for what he did to your parents.

918
01:08:51,347 --> 01:08:55,624
You see,
what none of us did know...

919
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:58,481
indeed,
what none of us could know...

920
01:08:58,579 --> 01:09:00,488
was that David's parents...

921
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:05,330
were trampled to death
at a Coconut Pete concert.

922
01:09:05,427 --> 01:09:07,882
What the hell's
wrong with you, Putman?

923
01:09:07,987 --> 01:09:10,637
Everyone knows Dave's parents
got killed at a Pete show.

924
01:09:10,739 --> 01:09:13,456
- Yeah, way to bring up a sore subject.

925
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:18,094
- What? I-- What?
- You think
I could have killed him?

926
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:21,162
He's my Uncle Petey.

927
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:23,602
You all saw him as...

928
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,088
a mellow island songster...

929
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,813
and a resort owner, but...

930
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:32,494
how many of you knew that he--
he was afraid of dogs...

931
01:09:32,595 --> 01:09:34,831
and that his favorite spice
was rosemary?

932
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:37,932
How many of you knew that...

933
01:09:38,035 --> 01:09:41,232
he was uncircumcised
and smelled of oranges?

934
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:44,114
Yes, that's all
well and good, David.

935
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:46,634
But I'll bet hind to horses...

936
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,976
that you inherit the island.

937
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:53,772
- The island is already mine.
- What?

938
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:56,753
Pete signed it over to me last week.

939
01:09:56,851 --> 01:09:59,436
He was going back on the--
on the road where he belonged.

940
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:02,987
He was forming a super group--
Billy Squier and Eddie Money!

941
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:07,630
Don Henley was gonna play drums!
Fuck, that would've been tight! Fuck.

942
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:12,106
He was gonna sell the island
to the navy for test bombing.

943
01:10:12,211 --> 01:10:14,829
But I told him I-I could handle
the responsibility.

944
01:10:14,931 --> 01:10:18,161
- Lars.

945
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,911
No! No!

946
01:10:21,012 --> 01:10:24,394
Pete.

947
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,565
Oh, my God! Pete!

948
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:34,632
Bravo, Lars, bravo.

949
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,839
Very convincing.
Very convincing.

950
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:42,577
- You fucker!
- Lars! No, stop it! No!

951
01:10:45,459 --> 01:10:46,921
- Stop it!
- Hold it, hold it!

952
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:50,672
- Let's lock him up again.
- No! No! Stop it!

953
01:10:50,772 --> 01:10:53,325
Stop it!
We're not locking anybody up!

954
01:10:53,428 --> 01:10:56,177
We're all gonna stay together,
in one room!

955
01:10:56,276 --> 01:10:58,348
Look, the boat
will be here tomorrow.

956
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:00,906
We'll go to the club,
gather all the guests...

957
01:11:01,013 --> 01:11:03,696
and wait until the morning,
and we're going to do this together.

958
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:07,276
And we're gonna make it
through the night, okay?

959
01:11:21,716 --> 01:11:23,604
Screw this, man!
I'm not going anywhere with Lars.

960
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:25,642
Well, I'm not going anywhere with Juan.

961
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,788
- Ooh!
- What kind of a man has sex with a goat?

962
01:11:27,892 --> 01:11:30,511
- Hey, I used a condom.
- Oh.

963
01:11:30,613 --> 01:11:32,817
You told me
they were against your religion.

964
01:11:34,516 --> 01:11:38,672
Ehhh, you know, I need to find Peenalop.

965
01:11:38,772 --> 01:11:42,417
- I am sure you all understand.

966
01:11:42,516 --> 01:11:45,549
You come anywhere near
my cabana, I'm taking your head off!.

967
01:11:45,652 --> 01:11:49,613
Let's get outta here, Dave. Come on,
Dave, let's get outta here, man.

968
01:11:49,717 --> 01:11:51,757
I don't think so.

969
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:59,982
-Jenny, you're making
a most grievous mistake.

970
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:05,197
I'm still not sure what happened...

971
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,268
with all that dodgy business
back in the jungle.

972
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:10,860
But I'm plagued by the dreams.

973
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:16,012
I believe I'm safer on my own.

974
01:12:16,116 --> 01:12:18,505
- Well, that plan went to hell.

975
01:12:18,612 --> 01:12:21,711
Well, at least
they left us a torch.

976
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:24,201
Jenny? Jenny?

977
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,075
I believe I know where the generator is.

978
01:12:47,157 --> 01:12:49,196
Damn it!
He must have taken my swords.

979
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,497
I don't care if have to carve a spear
out of bamboo, this asshole's--

980
01:12:52,596 --> 01:12:54,637
- Shh, shh, listen.
- No, I'm not gonna shush!

981
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:57,555
- I'm so sick of running from this--

982
01:12:57,652 --> 01:12:59,562
I thought
we didn't have any power.

983
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:03,596
- Dave?

984
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:07,214
- Dave. Dave?

985
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:15,763
God!

986
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:25,843
- It's me! It's me! It's me!

987
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:30,804
- Holy shit!

988
01:13:38,261 --> 01:13:41,610
Oh, my God!
The lock's broken!

989
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,604
Oh, my God! He's out there.

990
01:13:43,701 --> 01:13:46,800
Quick, under the bed,
hurry. Come on!

991
01:13:46,901 --> 01:13:50,610
- Go, go! Hurry!
- You'll never fit.

992
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:53,360
- Go, go, go, go, go!

993
01:13:54,581 --> 01:13:56,010
- Come on!

994
01:13:56,117 --> 01:13:58,027
- Hurry! Come on!

995
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,199
What are you doing?
Lars, what are you doing? Hurry!

996
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,210
- Lars, please!

997
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:05,618
- Come on!

998
01:14:05,717 --> 01:14:08,400
- Lars, come on! He's coming!

999
01:14:08,501 --> 01:14:11,884
- Oh, my God!

1000
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,673
- He's coming!

1001
01:14:16,213 --> 01:14:18,188
- Whew!
- Holy shit!

1002
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:20,911
Is that how you escaped
out of that window?

1003
01:14:21,013 --> 01:14:23,402
Why don’t you
just do that all the time?

1004
01:14:23,509 --> 01:14:26,192
Is that a fat joke?

1005
01:14:26,294 --> 01:14:28,181
What the hell?

1006
01:14:29,621 --> 01:14:32,404
- What the hell, Jenny?

1007
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:18,832
Putman! It was you?

1008
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:21,804
- What? What was me?
- Step back, Putman!

1009
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:25,358
Oh, you actually believe that
I'm the killer. Oh, that's a laugh.

1010
01:15:25,462 --> 01:15:27,534
Then what are you doing here?

1011
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:30,453
Well, I just popped by to say--

1012
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:33,200
- Uh--
- You perv.

1013
01:15:33,302 --> 01:15:36,848
Really, Jenny, there's a
perfectly reasonable explanation
for all this. I mean--

1014
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:40,081
Well, you see, it seemed like
such a good final memento and--

1015
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:43,760
Well l, I -- You know how good I think
you look in red, and that little--

1016
01:15:43,862 --> 01:15:47,889
- No!
- Oh, dear God! Oh, dear God!

1017
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,129
- Where's the key?
- I don't know.

1018
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:52,401
Lock the door!
Lock the door!

1019
01:15:52,503 --> 01:15:54,892
The lock's broken!

1020
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:56,656
Broken?

1021
01:15:56,757 --> 01:16:00,336
You've manacled me to my deathbed,
you Piccadilly whore!

1022
01:16:00,437 --> 01:16:04,180
- I'm so sorry.
- I could never stay mad at you, Jenny.

1023
01:16:04,278 --> 01:16:08,401
Quickly!
Give me the racket! Give me the balls!

1024
01:16:08,502 --> 01:16:11,764
- Go! Go! Yeah!
- Quickly! Run!

1025
01:16:13,142 --> 01:16:14,866
Get out!

1026
01:16:19,094 --> 01:16:21,942
Machete Phil! I knew it!

1027
01:16:23,734 --> 01:16:27,596
- Oh, God!

1028
01:16:27,702 --> 01:16:30,637
- Oh--
- Oh, God!

1029
01:16:30,743 --> 01:16:33,230
- Go.
- N-No!

1030
01:16:33,334 --> 01:16:35,406
- Go, dear Jen. Go.
- No!

1031
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,795
Namaste.

1032
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:42,000
Fuck off!.

1033
01:16:42,103 --> 01:16:44,885
- Come on.

1034
01:16:44,982 --> 01:16:47,317
I'm sorry.

1035
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:58,130
Ahhh, you!
I should have known it was you!

1036
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:01,133
- Doesn't surprise me a bit, really.
- Damn it, Putman!

1037
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:05,232
- Who is it?
- I'm sure you think
I'll go down without a fight.

1038
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:08,084
But it's not yet game, set--

1039
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:16,689
Soap, please.

1040
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:31,151
Hey! Nice helmet, Lars!

1041
01:18:31,255 --> 01:18:33,644
About time you two perverts
showed up for the party!

1042
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,751
Pour it! Pour it!

1043
01:18:39,255 --> 01:18:42,004
Oh, Jesus Christ!
That's blood!

1044
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:55,956
- What the fuck?
- Oh, God!

1045
01:18:57,495 --> 01:18:59,535
Oh, God!

1046
01:19:02,296 --> 01:19:06,070
- We're all gonna die!

1047
01:19:15,671 --> 01:19:18,835
Help! Help!

1048
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,479
Penelope!
Where's Juan?

1049
01:19:23,576 --> 01:19:26,892
I don't know,
I haven't seen him all night.

1050
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:30,196
What the hell is going on?

1051
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:33,198
Juan! Juan!

1052
01:19:33,304 --> 01:19:35,693
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What are you doing?

1053
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,175
- Let me go!
- Don't move!
Where the hell have you been?

1054
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:45,516
I was looking for Peenalop.
Why you are looking at me like that?

1055
01:19:45,624 --> 01:19:48,439
'Cause you disappeared a half-hour ago,
and now you show up covered in blood.

1056
01:19:48,536 --> 01:19:50,445
Because I just found Putman.

1057
01:19:50,551 --> 01:19:51,864
- He's dead.
- Oh, shit! Sam!

1058
01:19:51,864 --> 01:19:53,554
- He's dead.
- Oh, shit! Sam!

1059
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:56,176
- Oh, my God!

1060
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,866
- The mud bath!
- Let's go, Peenalop.

1061
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:18,224
Oh, God.

1062
01:20:54,264 --> 01:20:57,559
- Oh, no.
- What?

1063
01:20:59,033 --> 01:21:02,710
- Oh, fuck.
- Sam. Sam.

1064
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,669
- Sam!

1065
01:21:26,744 --> 01:21:29,330
- Get out.
- What?

1066
01:21:29,432 --> 01:21:32,912
Get out, now!

1067
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:39,223
Did you know that
I can hold my breath...

1068
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,287
for three minutes and 33 seconds?

1069
01:21:42,393 --> 01:21:45,175
Nobody ever suspects
the Fun Police.

1070
01:21:45,273 --> 01:21:48,055
- Bullshit. I always have suspected you.
- Bullshit. You did not.

1071
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,041
- You are the bullshit!

1072
01:21:50,136 --> 01:21:54,260
He's the guy from the campfire story--
Machete Phil, the kid with no dick.

1073
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,045
No. That's just
an old campfire story.

1074
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:59,633
What do you piss out of,
your asshole?

1075
01:21:59,736 --> 01:22:03,381
It's just a story! I have a dick.

1076
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,455
I'm not Machete Phil.

1077
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:07,862
I'm Machete Sam.

1078
01:22:07,961 --> 01:22:10,928
- Sam, why are you doing this?

1079
01:22:11,033 --> 01:22:13,815
Oh, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

1080
01:22:13,913 --> 01:22:18,036
I asked Rolo if he had any grass,
and he said he didn't have any.

1081
01:22:18,137 --> 01:22:20,657
So then I followed him
into the jungle.

1082
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:22,670
- Would you believe what I saw?
- No.

1083
01:22:22,777 --> 01:22:25,232
He had grass. My grass!

1084
01:22:25,337 --> 01:22:28,566
- A huge bag of it.

1085
01:22:28,665 --> 01:22:32,047
And he was smokin' it
with those two little hussies...

1086
01:22:32,153 --> 01:22:35,187
even though
he said he had none.

1087
01:22:36,697 --> 01:22:40,975
So then--
No, wait, that's not it.

1088
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,448
I found out that Pete was
giving the island to Dave.

1089
01:22:43,545 --> 01:22:46,359
Oh, yeah. That's it.
It wasn't about the grass.

1090
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:50,102
Although that was incredibly uncool.

1091
01:22:50,202 --> 01:22:53,168
It was about Pete giving the island
to that little shithead!

1092
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:56,851
All-night raving,
pill-popping little son of a bitch!

1093
01:22:56,953 --> 01:23:00,433
What about me? H uh?
I deserved it!

1094
01:23:00,538 --> 01:23:03,254
I 'm the best goddamned employee
this place has ever seen!

1095
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,328
Dave was gonna run it
into the ground.

1096
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:08,881
Not on my watch!
This is my home.

1097
01:23:08,986 --> 01:23:12,564
Pete thinks I’m just a clown,
good for fun and games.

1098
01:23:12,665 --> 01:23:15,283
Well, I got you guys
to do your jobs, didn't I?

1099
01:23:15,385 --> 01:23:17,490
Pretty good managerial skills,
don't you think?

1100
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:21,553
Setting you guys up to decipher
that stupid "Naughty Cal'"song.

1101
01:23:23,993 --> 01:23:26,132
Who's the orca?
Who's the octopus?

1102
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:30,902
I am the Walrus!
I am the Walrus! I am the Walrus!

1103
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:33,140
- Oh! Ooh!

1104
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,859
Get outta here! Now!
I can't hold him for long.

1105
01:23:35,962 --> 01:23:38,744
Try putting him to sleep!
Try the-the Snoring Panda!

1106
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:41,558
I can't reach it.
I can handle this.

1107
01:23:41,657 --> 01:23:43,861
- He'll orgasm for
another few minutes. Go!
- Ooh.

1108
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:46,296
- I'm not leaving you!
- I'll be okay.

1109
01:23:46,393 --> 01:23:49,044
- Get outta here. It's gonna get messy.
- Ooh. Ooh.

1110
01:23:49,146 --> 01:23:51,448
- Go.
- Go.

1111
01:23:51,546 --> 01:23:55,637
- Oh! Ohhh!

1112
01:23:55,738 --> 01:23:57,877
Oh! Ooh!

1113
01:23:57,977 --> 01:24:00,366
- Back to the club!
- Are you crazy?

1114
01:24:00,473 --> 01:24:04,533
It's the most secure building on
the island. It's where we keep the booze!

1115
01:24:07,994 --> 01:24:11,092
Look out, now.
Oh, oh-oh-oh! There you are!

1116
01:24:11,194 --> 01:24:13,081
- Baba-boobie!

1117
01:24:13,177 --> 01:24:15,927
- Peenalop!
-Juan!

1118
01:24:16,026 --> 01:24:18,579
Oh, God!

1119
01:24:18,682 --> 01:24:22,064
Look, he's after us.
She's safer with them. Let's go!

1120
01:24:23,386 --> 01:24:25,327
Let's go!

1121
01:24:25,433 --> 01:24:27,321
Get the gate!

1122
01:24:39,994 --> 01:24:41,969
Oh, God!

1123
01:24:42,074 --> 01:24:44,659
Oh, God! Nooo!

1124
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:46,802
- Oh, God!
- Peenalop!

1125
01:24:46,906 --> 01:24:50,037
- No! No!
- Peenalop! Peenalop!

1126
01:24:50,138 --> 01:24:52,277
- Stop!

1127
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:56,273
God! Stop it!
What are you doing?

1128
01:24:56,378 --> 01:24:59,127
- You'll never make it!
- Sam! Please!

1129
01:24:59,226 --> 01:25:04,081
- God!
What do you think you’re--
- Watch out!

1130
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:07,415
- Harder! Harder!

1131
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:11,289
- She can't breathe!

1132
01:25:15,482 --> 01:25:17,490
- Penelope! Get up.

1133
01:25:21,786 --> 01:25:26,097
- Ohh!
- uan! Juan! Juan, get up!

1134
01:25:26,202 --> 01:25:28,210
-Juan, get up.

1135
01:25:28,314 --> 01:25:32,242
Come on! Hurry! Come on!

1136
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:37,334
Oh, God.

1137
01:25:37,435 --> 01:25:41,232
It's not a party until
someone breaks the Jacuzzi.

1138
01:25:41,339 --> 01:25:43,412
- Oh, God! Juan!

1139
01:25:55,835 --> 01:25:58,683
- Lars!
- The Fun...

1140
01:25:58,778 --> 01:26:00,916
is done.

1141
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:06,355
What happened
to the hot tub?

1142
01:26:25,499 --> 01:26:27,387
Here we go!

1143
01:26:28,859 --> 01:26:30,768
Oh, God!

1144
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:34,769
- No!
- No, it's not possible!

1145
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:36,980
- What do we do?
- We can lose him in the jungle.

1146
01:26:37,082 --> 01:26:39,352
- The jungle?
- I can get us through!

1147
01:26:43,707 --> 01:26:46,009
Come on!

1148
01:26:46,107 --> 01:26:48,344
- Hurry!
- Go, go, go, go!

1149
01:26:48,443 --> 01:26:52,272
I know where this goes!
Let's go! Come on, quickly!

1150
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,583
- Go!

1151
01:26:57,563 --> 01:27:00,694
Oh, God!
This was your big plan?

1152
01:27:00,795 --> 01:27:03,894
We can do it. It's high tide.
All right, now listen.

1153
01:27:03,995 --> 01:27:06,745
I know this is going
to sound disgusting, but...

1154
01:27:06,842 --> 01:27:10,771
when you jump, keep your legs
together and clench your ass cheeks.

1155
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:14,519
Or else, water will fly up your butt hole
and pulverize your intestine.

1156
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:16,440
- Gross!

1157
01:27:16,539 --> 01:27:18,197
- Where are you?

1158
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:22,555
- I trust you, Juan.
- I'm coming! I'm coming!

1159
01:27:29,403 --> 01:27:30,586
Jesus!
Who is this girl?

1160
01:27:30,586 --> 01:27:32,375
Jesus!
Who is this girl?

1161
01:27:32,475 --> 01:27:34,363
She's...

1162
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,631
my girlfriend.

1163
01:27:58,587 --> 01:28:01,457
- Did you see it?
- I saw it.
- Oh, my asshole!

1164
01:28:01,563 --> 01:28:04,051
- What did you see?
- The Randy Rumrunner.

1165
01:28:04,156 --> 01:28:06,676
He didn't take it. He sunk it.

1166
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:09,397
Juan, anyway you could
dive down and get the propeller off?

1167
01:28:09,499 --> 01:28:11,955
We could put it
on the Smilin' Smuggler.

1168
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:15,705
- Consider it done, my friend.
- Come on, let's go.

1169
01:28:36,379 --> 01:28:38,354
Come on!

1170
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:43,643
Juan!

1171
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:48,789
- Come on.
- In the boat. In the boat.

1172
01:28:51,483 --> 01:28:55,280
Oh, God!
Where the hell is Juan?

1173
01:28:55,387 --> 01:28:58,966
-Juan? Juan?
- Juan, where are you?

1174
01:29:03,355 --> 01:29:05,494
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- It's okay.

1175
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:08,313
- You should see the other hombre.
- I'll put it on.

1176
01:29:11,196 --> 01:29:13,716
- Come on.

1177
01:29:17,148 --> 01:29:19,122
Juan!

1178
01:29:21,116 --> 01:29:24,564
It's all right.
It's okay.

1179
01:29:24,668 --> 01:29:27,735
I cannot imagine
a more beautiful way to go.

1180
01:29:27,836 --> 01:29:31,731
Just remember, Peenalop.

1181
01:29:31,836 --> 01:29:34,619
I love you.
!Carajo de mierda!

1182
01:29:34,717 --> 01:29:37,018
- I love you!

1183
01:29:37,116 --> 01:29:39,604
Maybe...

1184
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,716
before I go...

1185
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,707
one kiss.

1186
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:48,249
No, no, no.

1187
01:29:48,348 --> 01:29:51,480
I meant,
maybe you and Jenny could...

1188
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:54,002
- kiss each other.

1189
01:29:54,108 --> 01:29:56,280
I always...

1190
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,519
wanted...

1191
01:29:58,621 --> 01:30:02,134
to see that.

1192
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:05,532
- Oh, God!
- Juan!

1193
01:30:05,629 --> 01:30:08,018
Juan!

1194
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,973
- Aargh!
- Come on!

1195
01:30:34,077 --> 01:30:38,485
- Son of a bitch!

1196
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:49,243
- Go! Go, Jenny, go!

1197
01:30:52,477 --> 01:30:55,608
- Whoo-whoo!

1198
01:30:58,717 --> 01:31:00,757
Shit!
Turn it, turn it!

1199
01:31:00,861 --> 01:31:03,316
- Lars, what are you doing?
- Trust me.

1200
01:31:05,437 --> 01:31:07,346
- Lars, stop it!
- Come on, come on!

1201
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:11,381
- Yeah!

1202
01:31:13,308 --> 01:31:15,610
- You're bringing us closer to the raft!
- I know.

1203
01:31:32,061 --> 01:31:34,679
- Ahhhhhh!

1204
01:31:38,205 --> 01:31:40,474
Yeah!

1205
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,850
- Slowly, slowly.
- Okay.

1206
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:50,939
We gotta untie these lines.

1207
01:31:54,365 --> 01:31:58,010
- Hit it, Jenny! Go!

1208
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:06,324
- Ahhhhhh!
- Yeah!

1209
01:32:28,062 --> 01:32:30,647
Let's get the hell outta here.

1210
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:42,644
- Come on!
- Oh, come on!

1211
01:32:47,518 --> 01:32:50,682
- Die!

1212
01:32:50,781 --> 01:32:52,603
Son of a bitch!

1213
01:33:01,597 --> 01:33:04,019
They'll probably kick me
out of the Pacifist Club now.

1214
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,362
Or at least
ask you nicely to leave.

1215
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:12,917
Tian-tu--

1216
01:33:13,022 --> 01:33:15,575
- the Heaven Point.

1217
01:33:15,677 --> 01:33:18,328
Oh.

1218
01:33:30,558 --> 01:33:33,241
- Let's go, Peenalop.

1219
01:35:48,446 --> 01:35:51,414
Gracias, Sheriff!.

1220
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:56,405
- Cut it.

1221
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:58,998
- That is so whack!
- Knock that shit off, Juan.

1222
01:35:59,103 --> 01:36:01,045
You're gonna cause
a hysterical... thing.

1223
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:07,802
- That is so cheebah!

1224
01:36:07,903 --> 01:36:11,100
- I just lost it. Keep rolling,
keep rolling, keep rolling.

1225
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,086
That is some trick shit!

1226
01:36:13,182 --> 01:36:15,932
That is so on time, off the hook!

1227
01:36:16,031 --> 01:36:17,974
Tight! And heavy!

1228
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:20,599
That is so...
out of the planet!

1229
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,640
What other dumb fuckin'
catchphrases can I say?

1230
01:36:27,743 --> 01:36:32,085
Man, I can't hear shit. I've been standin'
next to amplifiers my whole life.

1231
01:36:34,752 --> 01:36:37,621
- Hello.

1232
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:44,408
- Oh, God, no!
- Oh, God--

1233
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:47,926
- Kinda scared me. Sorry.

1234
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:55,635
Which-Which, something.

1235
01:36:55,744 --> 01:36:57,882
Which seemed to suggest, uh--

1236
01:36:57,983 --> 01:37:00,285
Fuck, I don't know what it seemed
to suggest. Let me try that again.

1237
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,421
- Aaah!

1238
01:37:23,327 --> 01:37:26,142
Here we go, I 'l I do, um--
Okay, ready and action.

1239
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,126
But what about the sign
on Cliffs neck?

1240
01:37:28,223 --> 01:37:30,776
- It said, "staff only."
I mean, that clearly means--

1241
01:37:35,264 --> 01:37:37,685
- Mark!
- All right, well, tell us, then...

1242
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,864
how the hell are we
supposed to do our jobs...

1243
01:37:39,968 --> 01:37:42,903
when somebody is killing
the dick out of everybody on the island?

1244
01:37:43,008 --> 01:37:45,245
- Yes.

1245
01:37:45,344 --> 01:37:50,101
- Hey, listen. Listen, sugar britches.

1246
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:54,037
- All right. All right. Are we cutting?
- Just-Just do your job.

1247
01:37:54,143 --> 01:37:56,696
- No, I'm not cutting.
- Okay, cut it.

1248
01:39:06,591 --> 01:39:12,440
- Yeah!

1249
01:39:12,545 --> 01:39:19,004
- Come on, everybody!

1250
01:39:19,105 --> 01:39:23,894
- Pass that bong over here! Yeah!

1251
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,383
Whoo! Yeah!

1252
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,317
- Whoo!

1253
01:39:36,305 --> 01:39:42,879
