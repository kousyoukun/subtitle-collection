00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,634
I can't believe
you invited that guy.

2
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,800
He's such a bloody wanker.

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,333
Oh, cut it out, Rolo. God!
Why are you always makin' fun of him?

4
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,258
Give me a break.
Sissy Brit.

5
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,008
Who the hell
talks like that?

6
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,458
You're such a jerk, Rolo.
You're gonna love this shit.

7
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:49,125
Pure Costa Rica Freaka.

8
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,091
Ow!
Hey, Stacy,

9
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,917
while I torch this baby,
how about you lick my chest?

10
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:57,542
Oh.

11
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:15,208
Hey, what about my nipples?
Shut up! Someone's watching us.

12
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:18,133
A peeper, huh?
My kind of guy.

13
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,125
Rolo, I'm serious. It creeped me out.
All right, all right.

14
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,833
I know a place
more private...

15
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:27,542
and romantic.
Oh.

16
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:30,166
Ow!

17
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,175
Check it out.

18
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,759
What do you think?
Ooh!

19
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,217
Should we be doin' this here?

20
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:44,542
I mean, isn't this, like,
sacred or something?

21
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:46,834
What?
No, they're dead.

22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,217
You got any objections,
Ricky?

23
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:56,500
I think you should
give it to her, señor.

24
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,883
There he is again.

25
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,542
This guy's gonna be picking
his teeth out of my dump.

26
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,458
Stacy, this guy
doesn't even have teeth.

27

So, where are we
gonna do this?

33
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,458
I don't wanna get caught in
the middle of a cemetery.

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,125
Let's at least go inside
that old mausoleum.

35
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,125
Mm-hmm.

36
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,217
Wow.

we don't need you anymore.

What the...

40
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
It was probably
just the wind.

41
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,024
Okay, we're back in.

42

43

Heads or tails?

44
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:49,708
Mmm... heads.
Oh!

45
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:56,125
What's "tails"?
You don't wanna know.

46
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:06,171
What is it?
Too waxy?

47
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:08,800
Shh. I heard something.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,125
Was it, um,
a strange sucking sound?

49

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,508
Jackie O'Tripod.
Dude, what...

159
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,458
Oh, dude, check out that
orange bikini, dude.

160
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,717
Oh, dude, come on.

161
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,125
Do you want to
be drilled by Manny?

162
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,467
Bogey. Bogey.

163
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,717
12:00 noon.
Holy shit, dude.

164
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:55,750
I know that chick.
That's the chick on that TV show...

165
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,750
A.M. Pump Up with Amy Aerobics.
Oh, yeah.

166
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,550
She's the one
in the way back.

167
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,083
Dude, she was.
But then the chick by the palm tree died,

168
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,841
so she got promoted
to palm tree.

169
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,333
And then Amy Aerobics died,
and so she's the new number one chick, dude.

170
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,717
She's the new Amy Aerobics!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Amy Aerobics died?

171
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:15,000
What did she die of? She didn't die of
a fat ass, I'll tell you that, bro.

172
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,625
What's up?
Dude, don't be gay, man.

173
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,792
I don't think so.
Hi.

174
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,717
Oh! Whoo!
Hey.

175
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,717
Lars Brunckhorst. I'm the new masseur.
Hi.

176
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,675
- I'm Jenny.
- Really nice to meet you, Jenny.

177
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:34,175
- And this is Yu.
- And really nice to meet you, Yu.

178
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,875
So you're subbing in
for Inga this week?

179
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,425
Yeah.
Well, you'd better be good.

180
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,083
Inga had some great moves.
Let's see what you got.

181
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:43,792
Ooh.

182
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,087
Oh, God.
Inga never did anything like that.

183
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,250
Who's the fucking hippie?
I'll take that.

184
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,675
Hey, get your own
margy.

185
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:04,333
It's not for me. It's for our new masseur,
Lars. Are you serious?

186
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:07,125
We swapped out a six-foot
Swedish broad for this guy?

187
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,521
- I'm six-one.
- Cool!

188
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:11,717
Oh, don't worry about him.

189
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,834
He's Coconut Pete's nephew,
so he thinks he can get away with murder.

190
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:17,050
At least assault
with a deadly wet one.

191
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,667
Who wants to limbo?
Limbo! Limbo!

192
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,883
I'll show you the ropes
at the club tonight.

193
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:33,250
Look for me.
I'll be the cute chick behind the bar.

194
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,008
Attention:
Frankie back to Hollywood!

195
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,000
Dude, whatever.
Dude, this is you! This is you!

196
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,875
Bend it, don't break it. I'll bend anything.
I'm gettin' so fuckin' laid tonight.

Here comes Coconut Pete!

Hey, amigo.
You must be Lars.

Coconut Pete. Hey, man, I really appreciate
you bringing me in your life circle.

204
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,166
Pleasure's all mine.
Say, I hear good things about your fingers.

205
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,300
Is that a tranquillity blouse?

206
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,041
Yeah, it is. It's actually the same
one you wore on your album cover.

207
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,883
"Pink Crustaceans
and Good Vibrations"?

208
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,050
I read a 1977 interview
where you said that...

209
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,875
the teal and blue really kept you
focused during the tough times.

210
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:47,250
That sounds like something
I said back in '77.

211
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,050
I guess nobody told you,
but, uh,

212
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,837
you're supposed to wear the
Pleasure Sweater on luge duty.

213
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:54,625
Oh, yeah, they did,
but it's actually kind of hot in here,

214
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,717
and it was kind of
wadded up on the ground...

215
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,917
Just put the goddamn thing on.
Hank, give Lars a hand, will ya?

216
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:01,792
Oh, yeah.

217
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,417
- Thanks, Hank.
- Hey, Coco Pete, I have a present for you, my friend.

218
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:12,083
You see the beautiful flower
in the yellow dress? Mmm!

219
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:14,050
She's in full bloom.

220
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,750
She said she saw you in Tucson
three years ago, 14th row.

221
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,834
Excuse me, but weren't you
at one of my shows?

222
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,050
U of A, '99?

223
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,375
Yeah! I remember you!
You were in the...

224
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:35,091
Don't tell me...
15th row.

225
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:40,250
Fourteenth row! I have a pictographic
memory for pretty faces.

226
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,417
Well, hey,
how about the grand tour?

227
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:46,125
Yeah, sure.
Right this way.

228
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,300
Hey, buddy!

229
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,342
Ah, Jesus Christ!
That's tequila!

230
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:59,458
I was doubles partners with
Andre Agassi for an entire week.

231
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:02,091
I'm the one who taught 'Dre
to play Cocks and Quarters.

232
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:06,417
If you can believe it,
he'd never played Cocks and Quarters.

233
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,467
Wow. That's interesting.

234
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,816
Yeah, it's... Well, it's...
Hey, snow bunny!

235
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:13,966
- Give me a Drambuie, neat.
- You got it.

236
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:18,458
Well, all alone, huh? Well, don't worry.
"No woman, no cry," right, mon?

237
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:22,291
Actually, I was quite engaged until
you bullied your way in here.

238
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:25,175
Yeah, I heard you.
Something about, uh, Cocks and Quarters?

239
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,000
You know, we have that game in the States
too, except we call it Hide the Sausage.

240
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,000
I beg your pardon? Excuse me,
new fellow, please cut off this minor.

241
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,708
Oh, come on! If there's grass on the field,
then play ball.

242
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,375
Right, guv'nor?
Hey, Sammy, hit me!

And don't forget your condoms.
Tequila! Who wants some?

247
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:59,208
Hey, what, are you dancing alone?
Hey, sweetie. Come here.

So, tell me,
what brings you here to us, Peenalop?

260
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:44,648
Oh, oh. I'm on spring break.
I go to Oral Roberts.

261
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:48,959

Is that anything like an Anal Johnson?

'Cause, well,
I've done that a few times.

Or am I thinking of a Dirty Sanchez?
That's the one.

I don't know what that is.
Uh... it's not for you.

00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,792
But I'm still really psyched.
I've been waiting a long time for this.

308
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:09,041
- That's great.
- Hey, Jen.

309
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,400
I will be glad to never
have to do this again.

310
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,012
Yeah, it must be tough
living in paradise.

311
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:20,402
Oh, yeah.
You love it now, but just wait.

312
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:24,592
♪ Crab legs, crab legs
Rah, rah, rah ♪

313
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:28,375
Hey, you guys ever hear the
story of the Machete Maniac?

314
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:30,550
Ooh!

315
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,717
Let's hear it.

316
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:35,550
Yeah, I don't know.
It's probably too scary for you guys.

317
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,125
- No. No, it's not.
- No, come on, Dave. Please, tell us the story.

318
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,966
All right, what the hell.

319
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,254
This must've been, like,
15 years ago, you know?

320
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:50,085
We had a kid working at the club
named Phil Coletti.

321
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:53,717
And one night...
it was a night a lot like tonight...

322
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:57,708
this gorgeous woman comes into the club,
asks him if he wants to go out to the jungle.

323
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:59,592
He's like,
"Yeah. Why not?"

324
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:03,583
So they split. And as they started
getting out to the jungle...

325
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:07,333
further and further away
from the lights of the club,

326
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:09,508
she starts asking him
these questions, like,

327
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,542
does he believe in the local
legends of the island,

328
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:16,133
voodoo, zombies.

329
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,717
He's not too worried about it.

330
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:22,000
He just rolls right over,
starts putting the screws to her.

331
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,508
But something doesn't
feel right to Coletti.

332
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:30,542
But he can't see shit. It's pitch black,
so he just keeps bangin' away.

333
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:32,550
But then, boom!

334
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,383
A flash of lightning lights up the
whole island, and in that one moment...

335
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:42,583
Coletti looks around and sees not only is he
out in the middle of that old Mayan cemetery,

336
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:46,834
not only are all the other guys from the
resort standing around watching him,

337
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:49,834
but he sees that
he's having sex with a corpse.

338
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,883
A cold, white,

339
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,625
dirty-from-the-grave
dead body.

340
00:25:57,825 --> 00:26:00,550
And they say...

341
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,625
Phil Coletti calmly walked
to the groundskeeper's shack,

342
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,217
found a machete...

343
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:10,000
and chopped those staff members
into a hundred pieces.

344
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:15,217
And they say
he took that same machete,

345
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:19,417
chopped his own dick off and
ran screaming into the jungle.

346
00:26:19,617 --> 00:26:22,708
Nobody ever saw him after that.

347
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,800
But from that point on,

348
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,583
Phil Coletti
was forever known...

349
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:31,383
as Machete Phil.

350
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:36,083
Are you telling me there's some totally
deranged, dickless dude running around out there?

351
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:40,125
All I'm saying is I don't go into
the jungle alone if I can help it.

352
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,542
'Cause you can hear him,
and I've heard him...

353
00:26:43,742 --> 00:26:46,467
crying out,

354
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:50,592
"Where's my penis?

355
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:55,300
Where's my penis?
Where's my penis?"

356
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,959
And that boy was me!

357
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,583
You're an asshole,
Putman.

358
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,708
- Anybody get laid tonight?
- Hey, Pete.

359
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:19,800
I know I did.

360
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,508
Say, anybody seen
Rolo, Stacy or Kelly?

361
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,004
They're probably off screwing
around in the jungle somewhere.

362
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,500
Well, shit. I'm gonna need somebody
to run Luau Night tomorrow.

363
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,300
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll run Luau Night.

364
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,966
What, cut up a couple
of pineapples, whatever.

365
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,841
- Yeah, great. Sam, will you run Luau Night?
- Sure. Can do.

366
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:40,000
We'll get some grass mini-skirts,
maybe have a poi-eating contest,

367
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,258
and, uh,
everyone'll get laid.

368
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:45,342
Sounds great. People, please.

369
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:48,129
Is it too much to ask?
Have sex with the guests.

370
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,917

Where's Pretzel?

405
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,917
Come on. Cue Pretzel.
Cue Pretzel. Pretzel... Ah.

406
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,508
Pretzel!

407
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:19,125
Hey, Pretzel!
Get your twisted, salty ass out here.

00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:22,250
Hey!

409
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:30,125
Ocupado, bro.
Go!

410
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,717
Sorry, Cliff.
I need you in the maze.

411
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:43,834
I'm on break.
Be happy in your work, Pear.

412
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:46,750
Shit.

413
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,550
Eh, yeah.
Hey, look, I salty, yeah?

414
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,792
Wait. What's your name?
Listen, mommy, I call you later, all right?

415
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:58,625
Bye.

416
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,759
Shit!

417
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:30,417
I got you!

418
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,125
Whoa!

419
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,500
Huh?

420
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:37,000
♪

421
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,875
Hello?

422
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:56,208
Hello?

423
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,966
Lars?
Huh?

424
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:19,250
Oh. Sorry.
I was just in the middle of my Qi Kung.

425
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,508
Wow. Qi Kung?

426
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,841
Whoa!
I should have you on my show.

427
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,841
I guess you're not just into massage,
are you? Yeah, well...

428
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,417
I mean, body work's still my life,
but I've also done the Dianetic thing.

429
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:33,833
Spent a little time
in the Forum.

430
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,050
Did a little Falun Gong
in Bang Chow.

431
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,333
But you know who's got a great philosophy?
Who?

432
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,550
Coconut Pete.

433
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,550
Have a good time
all the time.

434
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,091
Always eat the worm.
Totally.

435
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,274
Sign our asses! Sign our asses!
Sign our asses!

436
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:51,458
What do you know about Feng Chi?
Um, nothing.

437
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,883
Snoring Panda.

438
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,275
Not to be confused
with Linou Gano,

439
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:01,950
the Leaking Turtle.
Oh, my God!

440
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,425
Don't try that in public.
Dude!

441
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,759
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
send you back over there.

442
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:09,917
You'll get plenty of signatures, all right?
Come on, hop.

443
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:12,300
Go ahead.

444
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,425
Come on, hop!
That's amazing.

445
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,883
It's all really about
connecting your meridians.

446
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,917
We all have energy that flows through us,
and it's all connected by buttons.

447
00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:22,333
So, what other buttons
can you push?

448
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,883
Tian-Tu.

449
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,983
The Heaven Point.

450
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:32,883
Fuck me!

451
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:36,091
Damn!

452
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,675
Maybe I should
take you home with me.

453
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:42,333
I don't know if I'd fit in your luggage.
Oh, shit!

454
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:46,091
What the...
Oh, my God!

455
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,258
Carlos?
What's he doin' up in the air?

456
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,542
- It's gonna be okay, dude.
- I'm not getting a pulse.

457
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,417
"Naughty Carlos"?

458
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,333
Who's driving the boat?

459
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,133
You really never played
this game as a kid?

460
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:08,500
We had a cheap Nicaraguan

00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,800
Shoulders down.

614
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,775
How are we looking, Dr. Wick?
You're looking fantastic, Amy.

615
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:35,750
Looking fantastic.
This is one of the top five cardio...

616
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:15,008
Let's do the sun salute!

617
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:18,441
Crab, crab, crab. Shot.
Throw it away. Salute.

618
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:21,741
Crab, crab, crab. Shot.
Throw it away. Salute.

619
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:24,841
Hey, let's dance.
It's easier when you're smiling.

620
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:28,250
I heard one of our ski boats last night.
Holy shit! That's great!

621
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,508
- I only heard it for a second, but...
- So what do we do?

622
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,917
If it is one of ours, this guy's got it.
It's probably not a real good idea...

623
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:36,083
to go lookin' for it unless you
want to get your dingy chopped off.

624
00:46:36,283 --> 00:46:38,000
What?

625
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:46,212
Hey, I figured it out. I know where
those lines on the board came from.

626
00:46:46,412 --> 00:46:50,550
You know that line, "Everyone's
looking to find their own paradise"?

627
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,750
That's from one of your songs. What the
fuck you talkin' about? One of my songs?

628
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,708
Yeah, it's off your album
"Sea Shanties and Wet Panties."

629
00:46:57,908 --> 00:47:00,791
- 1978?
- Let's see those pinchers, people!

630
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:03,875
What does this song
have to do with all this?

631
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:06,175
The name of the song
is "Naughty Cal."

632
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:09,583
Naughty Cliff. Naughty Carlos.
Naughty Cal!

633
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:13,583
♪ Naughty Cal
Bongo and Tokey ♪

634
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:17,383

♪ And fell and cracked
his shell ♪ Shit.

639
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:32,417
That's the line that was
on the board yesterday.

640
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,634
I didn't know
where it was from.

641
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:45,150
How do you not know
the words to your own song?

642
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,825
I don't even remember
making the album, okay?

643
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:52,500
Shit, it was '78.
We were all out of our gourds.

644
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,083
It was kind of a crazy time
in 1978.

645
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:59,467
Oh, man, we had
some fuckin' parties.

646
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:03,458
♪ Bongo the stoned crab
got high as a kite ♪

647

♪
"High as a kite"?

650
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:14,583
"He fell and cracked his shell"?
That's like Carlos up in the parasail.

651
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:19,792
Then "lost in a maze,"
exactly like Cliff.

652
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:26,750
So this guy is killing people
according to a fucking acid trip song?

653
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,634
This is insane!
Peter.

654
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:33,708
What's the song about?
Is there some sort of special significance?

655
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:35,883
Fuck no. I mean, uh,
I don't know.

656
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:40,417
It's a sea shanty.
Naughty Cal's this, uh, underwater cowboy,

657
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,634
and Tokey and Bongo
are his buddies.

658
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:46,400
And they go on this adventure to find,
uh, Atlantis or some shit.

659
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,166
- I-I-I...
- Let's listen to the next line and see what happens.

660
00:48:50,366 --> 00:48:55,250
♪ La-la-la-la lala-la-la-la
lalala-la-la ♪

661
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,800

I play it backwards.

666

♪ So, what the hell?
The orca and the octopus?

667
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:18,050
I mean, is it the next victims,
or is it the killer?

668
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:22,250
Our lives depend on us interpreting the
dumbest fucking song I've ever heard.

669
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,834
Please, don't hold back.
Just say what you really think.

670
00:49:25,034 --> 00:49:26,675
I'm not sensitive.

671
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,417
You know, I won about five fucking
gold records in my lifetime.

672
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:31,917
H-How many gold records
do you have?

673
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:34,467
Let's see how it ends.

674
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:37,650

we're all gonna die ♪

678
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:51,925
Jesus.

679
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,650
Pete!
Yu and Hank are dead.

680
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,429
Why? What did we do?
No, man.

681
00:49:57,629 --> 00:50:00,008
Yu and Hank
are fucking dead.

682
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:04,041
You threatening me? 'Cause if you are,
you little hairless lap dog...

683
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:05,959
Ay, puta!
Just come and look!

684
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:11,008
"Don't let this be Yu."

685
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,417
She was just trying
to warn the guests.

686
00:50:14,617 --> 00:50:16,875
Hank!

687
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:22,883

692
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,800
Why are we doing
a goddamn fashion show?

693
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,008
Because it's goddamn Fashion Show Wednesday,
that's why!

694
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:45,041
Look what happened to Yu!
Remember the warning: "Do your jobs or die"?

695
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,125
So we're just gonna put
little smiles on our faces...

696
00:50:47,325 --> 00:50:49,091
and march out there
and do our goddamn jobs.

697
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:52,041
You got that? Lars, you're up.
Come on. Let's go. You got it, Pete.

698
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,258
Lars Brunckhorst, everybody.

699
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:01,717
Lars is sporting
the Pleasure Poncho.

700
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:06,050
Only 19.95 at the gift shop.
Thank you, Lars.

701
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,150
I'm tellin' ya, I got a bad
feeling about that new guy.

702
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,250
You are right.
It all started when he got here, didn't it?

703
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,800
Sam, it isn't Lars or any of us.
Look, Jenny.

704
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,041
- I know why you're defending him.
- Pajamas! Come on! Move!

705
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,625
- Putman, pillow.
- Putman Livingston, I presume.

706
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:25,208
Oh, if it isn't
Little Lord Fauntleroy!

707
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:27,175
Pip, pip! Tallyho!

708
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,841
I got it.
In that song,

709
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:33,545
Naughty Cal sings
about the scary octopus.

710
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:37,050
Look at Putman!
Putman is the octopus.

711
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,959
- Hello?
- Dave, just go play with the curtains or something.

712
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,300
We can't dismiss that song.
What about Carlos and Cliff?

713
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,792
What about the fact that Hank was buried in
the sand like the buried treasure in the song?

714
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:50,937
All right,
so maybe the octopus...

715
00:51:51,137 --> 00:51:52,883
is the way
the next person dies?

716
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,717
How do you kill someone
with an octopus?

717
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:59,625
Octopus spelled backward is "supotco."
Juan, isn't that Spanish for something?

718
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,133
"Supotco"? No.
The word for shoe is zapato.

719
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:07,291
- Hmm. Shoe.
- Am I the only one who thinks his head looks like an octopus?

720
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,841
- Shh, shh, shh. Here he comes.
- What did I miss?

721
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:13,091
Apparently,
somebody's gonna get killed by a shoe. Hmm.

722
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:17,000
Okay, you guys, instead of focusing on the
song, why don't we go look for those boats?

723
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,166
- Good idea.
- Jenny, why don't you and I go search together?

724
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:23,217
Um...
Putman.

725
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:26,008
Why don't you and I go and look
for that boat? Are you daft?

726
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:30,041
I'm not going out in the jungle
with you and your bloody shiatsu.

727
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:32,966
If you're the killer,
you'll snap my neck like a twig.

728
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:36,250
All right, stick to the shore.
There's no reason to go in the jungle.

729
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,083
The boats are probably
gonna be covered with sticks.

730
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:41,050
Or branches.

731
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,966
Thanks much, officer.

732
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,508
Aren't you taking
any weapons?

733
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,841
I have all
the weapons I need.

734
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,500
Piss on that.
I'm taking a machete.

735
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,217
Thanks for doing this,
Lars.

736
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:58,041
You're very brave.
Just be careful, all right?

737
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,041
Good luck, Putman.

738
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:17,625
Better believe I'll be keeping an eye on you,
Mr. Miyagi.

739
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:35,041
I know you guys are probably a little
intimidated by cooking for the whole resort,

740
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:38,312
but I think you're gonna get
a big kick out of it, okay?

741
00:53:38,512 --> 00:53:41,383
I bet you watched
Yu and Kelly.

742
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:44,333
And most of it's just common sense.
Like right now,

743
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:47,146
I'm making my famous
Coconut Pete's Paella.

744
00:53:47,346 --> 00:53:49,959
Can anyone guess
the secret ingredient?

745
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:52,759
Come on.

746
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:55,333
Coconut Pete's Paella?

747
00:53:57,125 --> 00:54:00,004
The secret ingredient?

748
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,883
Coconut Pete's...
Eh...

749
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:06,208
- Coconut?
- Yes, goddamn it! Yes!

750
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:10,925
Yes!

751
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:15,959
Jesus! You think Eddie Money
has to put up with this shit?

752
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:22,166
Goddamn it!

753
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:27,091
Jesus Christ.
What you think?

754
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:29,467
I think Pete's under
a lot of pressure.

755
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,708
I don't think we can say for sure.
God, I don't know.

756
00:54:31,908 --> 00:54:33,966
- What are you doing?
- Uh, you know.

757
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:37,208
Just, uh, hanging around,
uh, looking through the window.

758
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:40,717
Calamari?

759
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:44,208
- Uh...
- It's an aphrodisiac, Juan.

760
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,925
Oh. Oh!
What's wrong?

761
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:52,333
You're not afraid of
a little octopus, are you?

762
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,166
Thank you.

763
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,050
When you're done here,

764
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,383
I want you to come inside
and find me,

765
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,542
'cause I wanna wrap my
little tentacles around you.

766
00:55:03,742 --> 00:55:06,583
Okay.

767
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:15,750
No way.

768
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:22,008
Think about it,
the octopus.

769
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:25,524
Look, she's a weird little chick,
I'll give you that.

770
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:29,041
But, look,
it still doesn't prove that she's the killer.

771
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:33,291
All right.
There is only one way to find out.

772
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:35,834
♪

773
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,550
Don't be nervous.

774
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:48,458
Eh,
I just want our first time to be wonderful.

775
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,962
So I would say that
if you're the killer,

776
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:55,668
just, you know,
just maybe don't kill me.

777
00:55:55,868 --> 00:55:58,175
Or at least make it,
you know, painless.

778
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:00,458
With those moves of yours,
I bet you could put me down nice and easy.

779
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,550
Just, zip, and I'm out, right?
Look.

780
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,625
The whole reason we're hiding in this closet
is because we think she's the killer.

781
00:56:05,825 --> 00:56:07,383
Oh.
I'm gonna bite you.

782
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,634
Well, not too hard, I hope.
I really like Juan.

783
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:12,583
I remember when we first met,
I was kinda like, "Who the fuck is this guy?

784
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:14,542
Some local guy
comin' down here and..."

785
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,500
Mmm.

786
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:26,834
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
You mean...

787
00:56:27,034 --> 00:56:29,625
you don't really go
to the Oral Roberts?

788
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:45,925
Aah!

789
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,175
I mean,

790
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:53,166
I just wanted to leave my past
behind me when I came here.

791
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,291
What the fuck are you,
a praying mantis an?

792
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,759
I...

793
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:06,250
I've never been
to a place like this.

794
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,875
I mean,
it's just so free.

795
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:13,337
Juan, I have spent
my whole life in a gym.

796
00:57:13,537 --> 00:57:17,208
I just wanted to party
like everyone else.

797
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,775
My coach, Orgrav,
would kill me if he found out.

798
00:57:22,975 --> 00:57:26,300
He would hunt me down
like a deranged lunatic.

799
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:31,291
He's really scary some...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

800
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:35,500
You are a gymnast?
Yeah.

801
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,458
Oh!
Gracias.

802
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,542
No tushie!
No! No!

803
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,667
I'll be right back.

804
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:21,250
Okay.

805
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,383
Eh, I'm still not sure.

806
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:31,000
I may need a few more hours
to pump her for information.

807
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,050
You asshole!
Now you're just trying to get laid.

808
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,792
How would you like to be stuffed in this
closet while I go out there and have sex?

809
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:38,521
That is a great idea.

810
00:58:38,721 --> 00:58:41,250
Shh! Here she comes!

811
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:50,417
What exactly
are your intentions with Jenny?

812
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:58,508
You know, Put,

813
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:03,291
during the Sung Dynasty, there was a
great mystic... Master Tsu Tong Po.

814
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:05,041
And he once said
something very wise:

815
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:09,316
"If you love something,
set it free.

816
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,792
If it comes back to you..."
Fuck off.

817
00:59:11,992 --> 00:59:14,000
It's a bloody Hallmark card.

818
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,125
Just trying
to help you, man.

819
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:22,834
Well, she has taken quite a fancy to you,
hasn't she?

820
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:26,917
But I have some...
ammunition of my own.

821
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:34,750
What kind of man would I be if I sat
idly by while you stole her from me?

822
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:42,458
Do not underestimate me, Lars.

823
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,125
I know things you don't.

824
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,041
All right, Lars,
let's see what you got.

825
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:36,567
Look what I found.

826
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:39,375
Wow.
Yeah. Shiny.

827
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:53,875
Hey.

828
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:04,208
Oh! I knew it.

829
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,841
Oh, sick fuck.

830
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:12,583
Dear God in heaven.

831
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:22,750
Lars?

832
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,917
Oh, dear God!

833
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:55,250
No!

834
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,550
No!

835
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,917
Huh?

836
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:18,425
- You!
- That's right, love.

837
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:22,083
Now take that stupid bag off
your head and give us a kiss.

838
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:27,875
- What?
- Advantage, Putman.

839
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:31,508
Hey...

840
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:33,800
Putman!

841
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,883
Putman!

842
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:39,708
Putman! Wake up, Putman. It's a dream!
It's just a dream, Putman.

843
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:46,208
♪

844
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:50,959
Farewell.

845
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,750
Keep it clean, keep it clean,
huh, mister?

846
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,000
That's a point!
That's a point!

847
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,500
Mira! The boat!

848
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,291
Whoo! Ay, Mami!
He found the fucking boat!

849
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,759
Whoo!

850
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:16,000
Hang on to your kudos.

851
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:20,717
Oh!
She's not going anywhere.

852
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:23,625
- What did you do to the propeller, man?
- I didn't do anything.

853
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:25,467
This is the one
that was pulling Carlos.

854
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:28,583
Well, we could send a group
to paddle out to the mainland.

855
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:31,217
We've got plenty of strong guys.
No chance.

856
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:34,717
The riptide'll
take you out to sea.

857
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:37,667
You'll be drinking your own
urine in less than 20 hours.

858
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,966
- Where's Putman?
- He's not here?

859
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,175
He left last night.
He ran off into the jungle.

860
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:47,133
Oh, by "ran off" do you mean
"got killed by you"? Ah!

861
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:50,750
What, did you really think we wouldn't notice
Putman was gone if you came back with a boat?

862
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,508
- Sam, that's ridiculous.
- Why is that ridiculous?

863
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:58,333
Hey, look. Putman freaked out in the middle
of the night and took off into the jungle.

864
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:00,604
Look, we went into your room last night,
Lars.

865
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:02,875
Mark David Chapman over here
has a shrine to Pete.

866
01:04:03,075 --> 01:04:05,541
It's unbelievable!
So I'm a fan.

867
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,008
A fan?
Man, you're a fucking loon!

868
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,508
Look, nobody here
was killed last night,

869
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,841
because Lars was in the
jungle killing Putman.

870
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,792
Hey, look.
I could never hurt another person, okay?

871
01:04:16,992 --> 01:04:18,717
I don't believe in violence.
Mm-hmm.

872
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:20,800
I touch other people
to make them feel better.

873
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,875
Come on. I have an obligation
to get to the bottom of that...

874
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:27,800
Ay! You are the fucking Fun Police!
Juan!

875
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,634
What the hell... Come on, take it easy!
Quit your bickering!

876
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:34,150
Now, we just get through one more night,
the boat will be here tomorrow.

877
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:37,667
We'll be all right. So, come on,
everybody, let's just have a drink...

878
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:41,008
and... mellow out.
I don't want to mellow out, Pete!

879
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:44,708
I want to know what Lars's deal is, huh? You
come here and everyone starts getting killed.

880
01:04:44,908 --> 01:04:47,291
Hey, I don't have to tell you shit, Fun Pig!
You wanna Fun arrest me?

881
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:50,000
You get a Fun-fucking warrant!
Until then,

882
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,291
stay out of my
Fun-fucking face!

883
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:55,333
Come on!

884
01:04:59,166 --> 01:05:02,170
Jenny, you know
I'm not the killer, right?

885
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:05,105
Look, Lars,
it's not so bad in here, okay?

886
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:07,841
- I'll bring you some magazine.
- Yeah.

887
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:10,166
You familiar with the expression
"sitting duck"?

888
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:13,508
No.

889
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:16,608
You guys, this is totally fucked up.
Look, Jenny,

890
01:05:16,808 --> 01:05:19,324
if he's the killer,
then we have him in this room.

891
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:22,041
And if not,
then at least we know it's not him.

892
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:34,291
Did it stink?
You bet it stunk.

893
01:05:34,491 --> 01:05:37,592
Oh, shit!

894
01:05:37,792 --> 01:05:41,213
Hey, you guys gonna be hanging
around for a while? Totally.

895
01:05:41,413 --> 01:05:44,834
We're just getting started.
Anyway, that's my mom for you.

896
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,566
Any of you guys
have a mother?

897
01:05:50,766 --> 01:05:53,095
Free drinks,
whoever catches me!

898
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:55,625
Whoo-hoo!

899
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,500
Shit.

900
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,917
Oh, God!

901
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:25,217
Your prayers
have been answered.

902
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:28,550
You asshole!
Nah, I'm not an asshole.

903
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,675
I'm just young, dumb and full...
What the fuck?

904
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:36,000
What? Something just brushed against my leg.
What the...

905
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,792
No, there's seriously
something down here.

906
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:41,800
- What?
- Oh, no, wait!

907
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,883
It's just my gigantic cock.

908
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,524
Amy's got some fantastic
advice for everybody.

909
01:06:47,724 --> 01:06:50,166
- Oh, my God.
- So, you want to get it on?

910
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:52,666
Dirk, get outta the pool!

911
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:54,966
Huh?
I'm not kidding!

912
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:59,708
- Hurry!
- Hey, that's what I call service!

913
01:06:59,908 --> 01:07:02,583
Now! Get outta the pool!

914
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,917
Hey, help me!

915
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:24,342
Putman! You're alive!

916
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:26,966
You put your arms
around me, Jenny.

917
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:30,125
I can only assume this means every
other man on the island is dead.

918
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:32,625
We got to get outta here!
Dirk's dead!

919
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:34,925
He just got electrocuted
in the pool!

920
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:39,083
Really? What was the look on his face?
He must have screamed bloody murder.

921
01:07:39,283 --> 01:07:42,008
You're scaring me.

922
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:45,959
I just want to know if smoke came
out of his ears. Is that so wrong?

923
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,925
Hey! Oh! Putman,
where have you been?

924
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,800
Running in circles through this
bloody jungle, that's where.

925
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,041
Thank God you're not dead.
Now, we need to get over to Pete's cabana...

926
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:56,091
and get that auxiliary generator.
Wait, hang on!

927
01:07:56,291 --> 01:08:00,291
If Dirk just got killed,
then Lars couldn't be the killer!

928
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:06,458
All right now, be on guard.
He might be a little cranky.

929
01:08:06,658 --> 01:08:08,895
Lars!
Lars, we're here!

930
01:08:09,095 --> 01:08:11,333
Oh, do give it
a rest, Jen.

931
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:19,588
He couldn't have.

932
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:21,959
He's far too large.

933
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,834
We gotta find Pete.

934
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:31,625
Pete!

935
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,333
Pete?

936
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:42,966
Pete?

937
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,217
You in here, Pete?

938
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:49,000
Peter!
We need the key to the generator box.

939
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:10,500
- Damn it!
- Isn't somebody going to get the fuckin' door?

940
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:20,041
Who's there?
Who's out there?

941
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,467
Hey!

942
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:32,542
I think there's
a problem with the lights!

943
01:09:32,742 --> 01:09:35,217
Right?

944
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,834
All right,
Lars will probably come after us here.

945
01:09:39,034 --> 01:09:41,300
We don't know for sure
that it is Lars.

946
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,217
And we don't know if he got out
or if someone else got in.

947
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:48,417
What is it with you and Lars? I'm beginning
to wonder if you aren't in cahoots!

948
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:51,208
I mean, let's see.
You had sex with Rolo, and he's dead.

949
01:09:51,408 --> 01:09:53,133
You and Cliff, right?
He's dead.

950
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:57,166
Give me a break. I screwed Juan and Pete,
and those guys aren't dead.

951
01:09:57,366 --> 01:09:59,883
Bloody hell, Jen!
Am I the only one?

952
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:02,650
All right, let's get back to the case.
What we have to do...

953
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:05,217
Why don't you drop the bullshit cop routine,
okay, Sam?

954
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:09,217
Oh, just as soon as you drop the
"I've got nothing to hide" routine, Juan.

955
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:14,458
Let me guess. You were in here looking for this
letter from the Encarnacion prison facility?

956
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:18,416
- What the fuck, man?
- Fuck, why you are doing this, man?

957
01:10:18,616 --> 01:10:22,375
"Juan shows no signs of the
bizarre and horrible behavior...

958
01:10:22,575 --> 01:10:24,258
"that brought him
to this institution.

959
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,467
"We believe him to be
fully rehabilitated...

960
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:31,046
and will be an excellent
addition to your staff."

961
01:10:31,246 --> 01:10:34,625
- What did you do, Juan?
- I did nothing, Jenny.

962
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:36,925
What the fuck
did you do, man?

963
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:41,258
Costa Rican prison...
that's some hard-core anal action, man.

964
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:44,941
- Juan, we have to know.
- What did you do, Juan? - What did you do, Juan?

965
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:48,625
- What the fuck did you do, man, huh?
- What did you do?

966
01:10:48,825 --> 01:10:51,125
Tell us!
I did nothing! Huh?

967
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,966
El Chupacabra!

968
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,342
Hey!
No!

969
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:03,417
Oh! Oh, my God!

970
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,733
- How could you do that?
- Wait, wait!

971
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:15,012
I did not do this.
I'm not the killer.

972
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:18,291
What the fuck, man?
Then, what is this?

973
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:20,467
You want to know what I did?

974
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,500
Huh?
You all want to know what I did?

975
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:29,250
Juan Castillo...
went to jail...

976
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:32,625
for having sex
with a goat.

977
01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:35,425
All right?

978
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:38,166
What you want me to say?

979
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:40,458
We lived on a farm!

980
01:11:40,658 --> 01:11:42,750
And I got lonely!

981
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:46,841
We were...

982
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:51,041
Oh, we were just
a couple of stupid kids.

983
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:53,375
No, it wasn't Juan.

984
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,729
It was Dave,

985
01:11:55,929 --> 01:11:57,883
wasn't it?

986
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:01,333
You hated him for what
he did to your parents.

987
01:12:01,533 --> 01:12:04,958
You see,
what none of us did know,

988
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:08,583
indeed,
what none of us could know...

989
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,634
was that
David's parents...

990
01:12:10,834 --> 01:12:15,917
were trampled to death
at a Coconut Pete concert.

991
01:12:16,117 --> 01:12:18,300
What the hell's
wrong with you, Putman?

992
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,400
Everyone knows Dave's parents
got killed at a Pete show.

993
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,300
Yeah, way to bring up
a sore subject.

994
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:29,291
- What? I... What?
- You think I could have killed him?

995
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,999
He's my Uncle Petey.

996
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,508
You all saw him as...

997
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,399
a mellow island songster...

998
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:40,091
and a resort owner, but...

999
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:44,208
how many of you knew that he...
he was afraid of dogs...

1000
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:46,291
and that his favorite spice
was rosemary?

1001
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,634
How many of you knew that...

1002
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:53,333
he was uncircumcised
and smelled of oranges?

1003
01:12:53,533 --> 01:12:56,417
Yes, that's all
well and good, David.

1004
01:12:56,617 --> 01:12:58,771
But I'll bet
hind to horses...

1005
01:12:58,971 --> 01:13:01,125
that you inherit
the island.

1006
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:06,212
- The island is already mine.
- What?

1007
01:13:06,412 --> 01:13:09,258
Pete signed it over to me
last week.

1008
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,712
He was going back on the...
on the road where he belonged.

1009
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:15,966
He was forming a supergroup...
Billy Squier and Eddie Money!

1010
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:20,792
Don Henley was gonna play drums!
Fuck, that would've been tight! Fuck.

1011
01:13:20,992 --> 01:13:25,500
He was gonna sell the island
to the navy for test bombing.

1012
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,375
But I told him I-I could
handle the responsibility.

1013
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,521
Lars.

1014
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:34,467
No! No!

1015
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:38,091
Pete.

1016
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:41,667
Oh, my God! Pete!

1017
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,675
Bravo, Lars, bravo.

1018
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:52,175
Very convincing.
Very convincing.

1019
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:57,333
- You fucker!
- Lars! No, stop it! No!

1020
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,592
Stop it!
Hold it, hold it!

1021
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:05,834
- Let's lock him up again.
- No! No! Stop it!

1022
01:14:06,034 --> 01:14:08,383
Stop it!
We're not locking anybody up!

1023
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:11,458
We're all gonna stay together,
in one room!

1024
01:14:11,658 --> 01:14:13,592
Look, the boat
will be here tomorrow.

1025
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:16,300
We'll go to the club,
gather all the guests...

1026
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,333
and wait until the morning,
and we're going to do this together.

1027
01:14:19,533 --> 01:14:22,667
And we're gonna make it
through the night, okay?

1028
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,212
Screw this, man!
I'm not going anywhere with Lars.

1029
01:14:40,412 --> 01:14:42,342
Well, I'm not going
anywhere with Juan.

1030
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:44,542
Ooh!
What kind of a man has sex with a goat?

1031
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:47,091
Hey, I used a condom.
Oh.

1032
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:49,375
You told me they were
against your religion.

1033
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:55,508
Ehhh, you know,
I need to find Peenalop.

1034
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:59,467
I am sure you all understand.

1035
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:02,800
You come anywhere near my cabana,
I'm taking your head off!

1036
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,250
Let's get outta here, Dave.
Come on, Dave, let's get outta here, man.

1037
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:09,458
I don't think so.

1038
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:17,708
Jenny, you're making
a most grievous mistake.

1039
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,217
I'm still
not sure what happened...

1040
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:26,750
with all that dodgy business
back in the jungle.

1041
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,041
But I'm plagued by the dreams.

1042
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:34,550
I believe
I'm safer on my own.

1043
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,217
Well, that plan
went to hell.

1044
01:15:37,417 --> 01:15:40,500
Well, at least
they left us a torch.

1045
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,217
Jenny? Jenny?

1046
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:48,375

01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,675
Oh, my God!
The lock's broken!

1066
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:05,800
Oh, my God! He's out there.

1067
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,587
Quick, under the bed,
hurry. Come on!

1068
01:17:09,787 --> 01:17:12,731
- Go, go! Hurry!
- You'll never fit.

1069
01:17:12,931 --> 01:17:15,875
Go, go, go, go, go!

1070
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:18,759
Come on!

1071
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:21,008
Hurry! Come on!

1072
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:24,458
What are you doing?
Lars, what are you doing? Hurry!

1073
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:26,300
Lars, please!

1074
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,883
Come on!

1075
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,841
Lars, come on! He's coming!

1076
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:35,425
Oh, my God!

1077
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:38,458
He's coming!

1078
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,883
Whew!
Holy shit!

1079
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:44,712
Is that how you escaped
out of that window?

1080
01:17:44,912 --> 01:17:47,542
Why don't you just do
that all the time?

1081
01:17:47,742 --> 01:17:50,417
Is that a fat joke?

1082
01:17:50,617 --> 01:17:52,250
What the hell?

1083
01:17:53,959 --> 01:17:56,583
What the hell, Jenny?

1084
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:45,133
Putman!
It was you?

1085
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:48,592
- What? What was me?
- Step back, Putman!

1086
01:18:48,792 --> 01:18:52,083
Oh, you actually believe that I'm the killer.
Oh, that's a laugh.

1087
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:54,812
Then what are you
doing here?

1088
01:18:55,012 --> 01:18:57,542
Well, I just popped by
to say...

1089
01:18:57,742 --> 01:19:00,383
Uh...
You perv.

1090
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:04,125
Really, Jenny, there's a perfectly reasonable
explanation for all this. I mean...

1091
01:19:04,325 --> 01:19:07,425
Well, you see, it seemed like
such a good final memento and...

1092
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:11,625
Well, I... You know how good I think
you look in red, and that little...

1093
01:19:11,825 --> 01:19:14,812
No! Oh, dear God!
Oh, dear God!

1094
01:19:15,012 --> 01:19:18,000
- Where's the key?
- I don't know.

1095
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,396
Lock the door!
Lock the door!

1096
01:19:20,596 --> 01:19:22,792
The lock's broken!

1097
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:24,550
Broken?

1098
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:28,608
You've manacled me to my deathbed,
you Piccadilly whore!

1099
01:19:28,808 --> 01:19:32,667
- I'm so sorry.
- I could never stay mad at you, Jenny.

1100
01:19:32,867 --> 01:19:37,166
Quickly, give me the racket,
give me the balls!

1101
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:40,208
Go! Go! Yeah!
- Quickly! Run!

1102
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,458
Get out!

1103
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,834
Machete Phil!
I knew it!

1104
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:56,717
Oh, God!

1105
01:19:56,917 --> 01:20:00,125
- Oh...
- Oh, God!

1106
01:20:00,325 --> 01:20:02,841
Go.
N-No!

1107
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:05,041
Go, dear Jen. Go.
No!

1108
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:09,503
Namaste.

1109
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:11,841
Fuck off!

1110
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:14,754
Come on.

1111
01:20:14,954 --> 01:20:17,667
I'm sorry.

1112
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:28,717
Ahhh, you! I should
have known it was you!

1113
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:31,841
Doesn't surprise me a bit, really.
Damn it, Putman!

1114
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:36,208
Who is it? I'm sure you think
I'll go down without a fight.

1115
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:39,166
But it's not yet
game, set...

1116
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:50,834
Soap, please.

1117
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,800
Hey!
Nice helmet, Lars!

1118
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,333
About time you two perverts
showed up for the party!

1119
01:22:08,533 --> 01:22:11,375
Pour it! Pour it!

1120
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,834
Oh, Jesus Christ!
That's blood!

1121
01:22:27,959 --> 01:22:31,375
What the fuck?
Oh, God!

1122
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:35,166
Oh, God!

1123
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,959
We're all gonna die!

1124
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,333
Help! Help!

1125
01:22:57,291 --> 01:23:00,383
Penelope!
Where's Juan?

1126
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:04,000
I don't know,
I haven't seen him all night.

1127
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,291
What the hell is going on?

1128
01:23:07,491 --> 01:23:10,383
Juan! Juan!

1129
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:13,217
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What are you doing?

1130
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:17,841
- Let me go!
- Don't move! Where the hell have you been?

1131
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:23,175
I was looking for Peenalop.
Why you are looking at me like that?

1132
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:26,250
'Cause you disappeared a half hour ago,
and now you show up covered in blood.

1133
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:29,042
Because I just found Putman.

1134
01:23:29,242 --> 01:23:31,634
- He's dead.
- Oh, shit! Sam!

1135
01:23:31,834 --> 01:23:34,508
Oh, my God!

1136
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,041
The mud bath!
- Let's go, Peenalop.

1137
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,208
Oh, God.

1138
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:38,166
- Oh, no.
- What?

1139
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,583
Oh, fuck.
- Sam. Sam.

1140
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,667
Sam!

1141
01:25:08,959 --> 01:25:11,458
- Get out.
- What?

1142
01:25:11,658 --> 01:25:15,333
Get out, now!

1143
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:21,759
Did you know that
I can hold my breath...

1144
01:25:21,959 --> 01:25:24,962
for three minutes
and 33 seconds?

1145
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:27,966
Nobody ever suspects
the Fun Police.

1146
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:31,166
- Bullshit. I always have suspected you.
- Bullshit. You did not.

1147
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:33,175
You are the bullshit!

1148
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:37,583
He's the guy from the campfire story...
Machete Phil, the kid with no dick.

1149
01:25:37,783 --> 01:25:40,500
No. That's just
an old campfire story.

1150
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,417
What do you piss out of,
your asshole?

1151
01:25:43,617 --> 01:25:47,250
It's just a story!
I have a dick.

1152
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,166
I'm not Machete Phil.

1153
01:25:49,366 --> 01:25:51,759
I'm Machete Sam.

1154
01:25:51,959 --> 01:25:54,841
Sam, why are you doing this?

1155
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,008
Oh, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

1156
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:02,417
I asked Rolo if he had any grass,
and he said he didn't have any.

1157
01:26:02,617 --> 01:26:05,208
So then I followed him
into the jungle.

1158
01:26:05,408 --> 01:26:07,291
Would you believe what I saw?
No.

1159
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:09,717
He had grass.
My grass!

1160
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:13,217
A huge bag of it.

1161
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:17,041
And he was smokin' it
with those two little hussies,

1162
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:20,041
even though
he said he had none.

1163
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:26,091
So then... No, wait,
that's not it.

1164
01:26:26,291 --> 01:26:29,083
I found out that Pete was
giving the island to Dave.

1165
01:26:29,283 --> 01:26:32,083
Oh, yeah. That's it.
It wasn't about the grass.

1166
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:35,883
Although that was
incredibly uncool.

1167
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:39,083
It was about Pete giving the
island to that little shithead!

1168
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:42,917
All-night raving,
pill-popping little son of a bitch!

1169
01:26:43,117 --> 01:26:46,425
What about me? Huh?
I deserved it!

1170
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:49,583
I'm the best goddamned employee
this place has ever seen!

1171
01:26:49,783 --> 01:26:51,583
Dave was gonna run it
into the ground.

1172
01:26:51,783 --> 01:26:55,175
Not on my watch!
This is my home.

1173
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:59,333
Pete thinks I'm just a clown,
good for fun and games.

1174
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:01,833
Well, I got you guys
to do your jobs, didn't I?

1175
01:27:02,033 --> 01:27:04,133
Pretty good managerial skills,
don't you think?

1176
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:08,500
Setting you guys up to decipher that stupid
"Naughty Cal" song.

1177
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:13,217
Who's the orca?
Who's the octopus?

1178
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:18,458
I am the Walrus! I am
the Walrus! I am the Walrus!

1179
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:20,592
Oh! Ooh!

1180
01:27:20,792 --> 01:27:23,300
Get outta here! Now!
I can't hold him for long.

1181
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,462
Try putting him to sleep!
Try the-the Snoring Panda!

1182
01:27:26,662 --> 01:27:29,425
I can't reach it.
I can handle this.

1183
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,959
He'll orgasm for another few minutes.
Go! Ooh.

1184
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,217
I'm not leaving you!
I'll be okay.

1185
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:37,291
Get outta here.
It's gonna get messy. Ooh. Ooh.

1186
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:39,467
Go.
Go.

1187
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:43,004
Oh!
Ohhh!

1188
01:27:43,204 --> 01:27:46,342
Oh! Ooh!

1189
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:49,300
Back to the club!
Are you crazy?

1190
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:53,375
It's the most secure building on the island.
It's where we keep the booze!

1191
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,333
Look out, now. Oh, oh-oh-oh!
There you are!

1192
01:28:00,533 --> 01:28:02,300
Baba-boobie!

1193
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,166
- Peenalop!
- Juan!

1194
01:28:05,366 --> 01:28:08,133
Oh, God!

1195
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:11,458
Look, he's after us.
She's safer with them. Let's go!

1196
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,008
Let's go!

1197
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,875
Get the gate!

1198
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:32,508
Oh, God!

1199
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:35,175
Oh, God! Nooo!

1200
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,383
- Oh, God!
- Peenalop!

1201
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:40,337
- No! No!
- Peenalop! Peenalop!

1202
01:28:40,537 --> 01:28:43,091
Stop!

1203
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:47,300
God! Stop it!
What are you doing?

1204
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,425
You'll never make it!
Sam! Please!

1205
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:55,625
- God! What do you think you're...
- Watch out!

1206
01:28:55,825 --> 01:28:59,175
Harder! Harder!

1207
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:02,792
She can't breathe!

1208
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,500
Penelope!
Get up.

1209
01:29:13,917 --> 01:29:17,254
- Ohh!
- Juan! Juan! Juan, get up!

1210
01:29:17,454 --> 01:29:20,592
Juan, get up.

1211
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:24,583
Come on!
Hurry! Come on!

1212
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:30,217
Oh, God.

1213
01:29:30,417 --> 01:29:34,500
It's not a party until
someone breaks the Jacuzzi.

1214
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,375
Oh, God! Juan!

1215
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:52,291
Lars!
The Fun...

1216
01:29:52,491 --> 01:29:54,834
is done.

1217
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,500
What happened
to the hot tub?

1218
01:30:20,417 --> 01:30:22,083
Here we go!

1219
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:26,133
Oh, God!

1220
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:29,925
No!
No, it's not possible!

1221
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,417
- What do we do?
- We can lose him in the jungle.

1222
01:30:32,617 --> 01:30:34,542
- The jungle?
- I can get us through!

1223
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,467
Come on!

1224
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:44,008
Hurry!
Go, go, go, go!

1225
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:48,500
I know where this goes!
Let's go! Come on, quickly!

1226
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,458
Go!

1227
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,966
Oh, God!
This was your big plan?

1228
01:30:57,166 --> 01:31:00,254
We can do it. It's high tide.
All right, now listen.

1229
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:03,342
I know this is going
to sound disgusting, but...

1230
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:07,467
when you jump, keep your legs
together and clench your ass cheeks.

1231
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:11,708
Or else, water will fly up your butt
hole and paralyze your intestine.

1232
01:31:11,908 --> 01:31:13,508
Gross!

1233
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:15,383
Where are you?

1234
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:19,583
I trust you, Juan.
I'm coming! I'm coming!

1235
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:30,250
Jesus!
Who is this girl?

1236
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:32,133
She's...

1237
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:34,250
my girlfriend.

1238
01:31:57,417 --> 01:31:58,675
Did you see it?

1239
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:00,800
I saw it.
Ow, my asshole!

1240
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,291
What did you see?
The Randy Rumrunner.

1241
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,759
He didn't take it.
He sunk it.

1242
01:32:05,959 --> 01:32:08,917
Juan, any way you could dive
down and get the propeller off?

1243
01:32:09,117 --> 01:32:11,383
We could put it
on the Smilin' Smuggler.

1244
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:15,041
- Consider it done, my friend.
- Come on, let's go.

1245
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,667
Come on!

1246
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:44,166
Juan!

1247
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:49,458
Come on. In the boat.
In the boat.

1248
01:32:52,542 --> 01:32:56,508
Oh, God!
Where the hell is Juan?

1249
01:32:56,708 --> 01:33:00,500
Juan? Juan?
Juan, where are you?

1250
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:07,258
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
It's okay.

1251
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:09,875
- You should see the other hombre.
- I'll put it on.

1252
01:33:12,959 --> 01:33:15,959
Come on.

1253
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:21,166
Juan!

1254
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:26,925
It's all right.
It's okay.

1255
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:30,500
I cannot imagine
a more beautiful way to go.

1256
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:34,550
Just remember, Peenalop.

1257
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,750
I love you.
Carajo de mierda!

1258
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:39,800
I love you!

1259
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,467
Maybe,

1260
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:44,834
before I go...

1261
01:33:45,034 --> 01:33:46,792
one kiss.

1262
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:51,675
No, no, no.

1263
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,671
I meant,
maybe you and Jenny could...

1264
01:33:54,871 --> 01:33:57,667
kiss each other.

1265
01:33:57,867 --> 01:34:00,104
I always...

1266
01:34:00,304 --> 01:34:03,302
wanted...

1267
01:34:03,502 --> 01:34:06,300
to see that.

1268
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,708
Oh, God!
Juan!

1269

Juan!

1270
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:39,342

- Come on!

Trust me.

Come on, come on!

Slowly, slowly.
Okay.

1282
