This trip to Lyon should take
no more than three hours

3
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,234
if we don't stop.

4
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,636
Maybe we stop there then and
have a late dinner or something.

5
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,506
(Speaking french) right?

6
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,447
No...
I butchered that

7
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,117
Then we're in Lyon
for two nights or three?

8
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,253
We can just leave that open.

9
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:59,258
But there's some big old church
that we've got to see, Basilica.

<i>You've reached Crystal Davis,

<i>I'll call you back as soon
as I can, bye bye, God bless.</i>

12
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:20,212
Hey mom, it's me.
Um, just trying you again.

13
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,615
Um, they're guessing

14
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,417
she's not going
to make it through the night,

15
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,122
but um... I will
try you again later, bye.

I'd like to thank you all

17

for coming out here today.

18
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,620
This is a time of terrible loss.

19
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,623
We are gathered here
in Jesus's name

20
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,293
<i>to share our love
for our friend Nicole Prevot.</i>

21

compassion for each other

I don't have
any where else to go.

I know... Look,
I'm going back to work, Okay?

34
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,523
I've had to be in the hospital
for like,

35
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,724
the last four months.

36
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,661
Could I just have
one more month?

37
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:16,728
Please.

38
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,730

00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,740
I'm seriously in like a really
bad thing with my landlord.

41
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,377
So, like you wanna come back?

42
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,280
No, I never left,

43
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,549
I just asked for
a couple extra weeks off.

44
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,321
Oh shit, you're right.

45
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,424
Now I feel like an asshole.

46
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,993
Look, I'm sorry, but,

47
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,796
I mean, we really don't
need anyone right now.

taking orders again?

50

Right, but half of these
designs are mine, JD.

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,578
Aw shit, I'm sorry.

Hey! Mwah. Come on in.

I just got home myself.

58
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,513
I found this bed skirt
at Big Lots for $9.

59
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,549
It's perfect for hiding
some of the stuff

60
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,950
that doesn't look so pretty.

61
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,887
- Never was there. [Laughs]
- Looks good.

62
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,926
I am so excited that
you're home to stay.

63
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:04,596
I'm sorry that I never ended up
making it down to the hospital.

64
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,799
I was planning to that
Tuesday when you called,

65
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,967
but then I went off and left

66
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,470
Mr. Moffat's
prescriptions at home.

67
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,739

his whole house.

[laughs]

73
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,621
Uh, yeah that night I called
I just got overwhelmed

74
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,959
I thought you had experience,
but it's totally Okay.

75
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,695
It is never easy moving on,

76
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:40,632
I could clean out
a couple of these drawers,

77
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,501
make them free again.

78
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,803
I mean I really
don't have anything.

79
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,005
Oh and your brother's
coming home in a couple of days.

80
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,876
I guess he couldn't hide her
from us forever, could he?

81
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,778
Couple days, right?

82
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,546
Ohhh,

a new picture of you.

He's just told me a little bit,
he looks just like him.

It's got my name!

- It's a decanter.
- Oh and what's that for?

Oh well, we don't
drink that stuff, dear.

Oh everyone's going
to be so excited to see y'all.

00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,912
I'm hoping to get some
boating time in too.

161

Carrie has never fished.

If there's time. It's gonna
be an insane couple of weeks

making sure this
deal goes through,

166
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,192
so can't make any promises.

167
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,728
Well, I've got nothing going on,

168
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,196
so if you guys need any help.

169
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,264
- Oh thank you.
- Sorry, one sec.

170
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,934
This is Justin.

171
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,937
So, when are you heading back?

172
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,273
Spending a lot more
time here now, with this...

173
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,809
Yeah well we weren't really sure

174
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,978
how long the branch
set up here would take.

175
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
- So, no flights booked back yet.
- Yay!

176
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,215
(Lauren) <i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>it's actually happening</i>

177
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,217
Justin has been
talking about this forever.

178
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,018
Yeah, but my parents

179
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,854
will probably need us
back in Napa soon,

180
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,756
we're part of the
headquarters team,

181
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,758
but Kenny will run
the Vineyard here,

182
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,060
once it's set up, so thankfully
we don't have to stay.

183
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,866
But, we will
be be back and forth

184
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:51,770
I'm sure, and visiting a lot.

185
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,073
You just do what you need to do,

186
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:59,310
things were hectic for Averall
and I too at your age,

187
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,247
you've got each other and some
day you'll have more time.

188
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,884
Yeah, we really
work well together,

189
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,986
it helps with the chaos.

190
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,021
Oh, I understand,

191
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,091
such a blessing and you'd
be surprised how many people

192
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,193
never wind up finding that.

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,803
Lauren, Justin told me
about Nicole, I'm so sorry.

194
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,271
Oh, thank you.

195
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,406
Yeah, I just can't even imagine.

196
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,810
<i>You know,
to be one of those that</i>

197
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,812
has found what you were saying,

198
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:37,949
I... it's just not fair.

199
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,820
Well, that's not really
what I was meaning.

200
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,222
But, she was a real good friend.

201
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,392
Thank you.

202
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,031
Lobi Kenobi!

203
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,968
- Just fixing this real quick.
- Fun.

204
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,905
Don't want Carrie thinking,
you know,

205
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,407
going for charming
over hillbilly.

206
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,411
Hoping to win her over

207
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,213
to the dark side.

208
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,882
[Darth Vader imitation]

209
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,619
<i>Oh my gosh.</i>

210
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,020
Let me see those.

211
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,962
Okay, these earrings you added
kind of look like sperm now.

212
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,232
Yeah a little bit.

213
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,202
You wanna play?

214
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,270
Yeah.

215
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,440
- Take five.
- Okay.

216
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,177
All right, all right.

217
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,980
Do you have the guy who

218
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,183
is required to remain 200 feet
away from playgrounds?

219
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,355
- That guy?
- Yup, that's him.

220
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,360
You been... uh

221
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,296
You been Okay?

222
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,965
Yeah I've been totally Okay.
You have?

223
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,001
I really thought the timing
was gonna work out,

224
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,303
and we'd be here.

225
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,039
But, it all happened
so quick at the end.

226
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,110
I'm so sorry.
She was so great.

227
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,346
5pm, yeah, 5pm, right.

228
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,148
Sorry Lobi, can we...

229
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,182
Can we finish later?

230
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,920
We're on a really tight leash
right now and this designer

231
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,988
is taking his sweet time
with the labels.

232
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,190
Labels? Wine labels?

233
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:30,428
Yes, we will send them over
immediately, thank you.

234
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,330
[sighs]

235
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,133
I mean, I can help
you guys out with that.

236
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,168
If you have something already,
that's totally fine,

237
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,004
but you know that's what I do.

238
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,139
Well...

239
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,174
I'd love to help you guys out

240
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,012
Yeah.
You wanna take a crack at it?

241
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:54,018
There, we actually have
some bids out already, so...

242
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,286
Right, there are some bids out,

243
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,356
but we haven't
settled on anything yet.

244
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,959
Great, just tell me
what you guys want.

245
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,295
- I mean if it sounds fun, yeah?
- Yeah.

246
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,297
Yeah.

247
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,539
Stacy, Stacy, look who's here.

248
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,042
- And look.
- Oh my God, I can't believe it

249
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,347
(Crystal) <i>Wait until you see</i>
<i>Heather, she's about to pop.</i>

250
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,084
Good to see you.

251
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,286
Hi how are you, Heather?

252
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,988
Hey!

253
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,589
Well hello stranger,
how are you?

254
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,492
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

255
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,230
I got both of my kids back,
I got Lauren and Justin.

256
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,033
Who has the "J"?
Think jelly bean.

257
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,134
(Justin)
<i>And this little local start up</i>

258
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,403
that Kenny and I
had in mind years ago,

259
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,772
well it could turn into
something pretty legit.

260
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,341
Once we convince the investors
to take a chance here,

261
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,443
Missouri and Kansas are next.

262
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,379
Lauren and Kenny used to go out.

263
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:58,016
- Right, I remember.
- Oh, I met him didn't I?

264
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,184
Carrie's been marketing
wine tastings for her family

265
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,320
since she was like a teenager,

266
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,354
tell em babe.

267
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,057
That's right, since I was a kid.

268
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,159
You don't drink
that stuff do ya?

269
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,131
I got dirty.

270
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,199
Now, why'd you do that?
Come here.

271
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,468
Lauren this might be
something good for you to do,

272
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,304
- we could sell it together.
- Yeah maybe so.

273
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,273
No, you all could be a lot
more generous than that

274
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,275
with your pours, I got plenty.

275
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,352
Excuse me,
really good seeing you.

276
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,389
Oh,

277
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,060
this place wasn't really built
with reception in mind, was it?

278
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,494
Nope, probably not.

279
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,499
- Feeling overdressed?
- They said party.

280
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,335
[sighs]

281
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,675
So, I've had vodka all along.

282
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,243
Don't tell anybody

283
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,313
Thank God.

284
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,853
I just wanna make sure
we get a prayer in,

285
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,155
before people start
needing to leave.

286
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,491
I know we've got bed times
for some of our little ones.

287
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,194
Also, I want to say
how excited we are

288
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,162
to welcome back
a few of our own.

289
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:23,134
Lauren, and Justin, and Carrie,
it's also so great to have you.

290
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:28,172
Justin, I was wondering if
you'd mind leading us in prayer?

291
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,641
I'd love to, yeah, Okay.

292
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,311
Um, well it's really great
to be back,

293
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,179
miss seeing a lot of your faces

294
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,681
some not so much.

295
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,183
- Oh, he didn't mean that
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

296
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,466
So let's go ahead and pray
before I make a fool of myself.

297
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,724
We just want to thank you
so much for this opportunity

298
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,327
<i>to come together
friends and family,</i>

299
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,463
<i>to just celebrate the day,
and life, and...</i>

300
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,199
I pray that you bless all of us
<i>as we head out of here today,</i>

301
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,202
keep us all safe,
in the days and weeks to come.

302
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,571
We love you.
In your holy name we pray. Amen.

303
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,607
- Amen.
- Go Sooners!

304
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,277
And the decanter
was a total bust,

305
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,512
I felt like an idiot.

306
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,913
We don't drink wine.

307
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,249
Well, I wish I had known that.

308
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,750
It didn't even occur to me babe.

309
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,654
I promise, she didn't think...

310
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,391
- it's not a big deal, I promise.
- Well, to me, it... I just,

311
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,193
I want them to like me.

312
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,563
- Never mind.
- They do, I can tell.

313
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,933
It's fine.
But Justin, the labels.

314
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:33,337
- They're already on their way...
- Shhh, stop, stop.

315
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,175
- The vent. She can hear you.
- Okay.

316
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,779
No, it's fine, you can tell me,
just do it quietly.

317
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,652
You know that the labels
are ready for shipping

318
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,254
and that my Dad
usually uses the same guy

319
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,257
- Why would you tell Lauren?
- You saw her face,

320
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,593
this will help her take her
mind off of all the other stuff

321
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,795
and then we'll just tell her
that your Dad uses a...

322
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:01,632
You know what, you're right.
It's not a big deal.

323
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,735
Sounds like it is.

324
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:09,640
Here, take the floor,
state your case, babe.

325
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,414
I just think... maybe

326
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,317
Lauren doesn't need
the distraction, I mean,

327
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,286
maybe you should just
let her feel it instead...

328
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,354
Here you go.

329
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,589
There's a wash cloth here,

330
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,490
you just gotta shove it
in the drain hole

331
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,725
if you need to take a bath.

332
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,594
Oh, thank you.

333
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,662
And I'm leaving
a night light on in the hall

334
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,231
in case you have to pee-pee.

335
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,367
- Thank you.
- Okay-dokey, well good night.

336
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,302
Justin, I fixing up the couch

337
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,305
- Oh, Mom let me do that.
- The couch?

338
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,342
Yeah, yeah, that's just
how it's done here.

339
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,776
Listen, can you set
a backup alarm for eight?

340
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,311
We have to be up
and at Kenny's by...

341
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,713
10, I have two set already.

342
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,548
You're perfect.

343
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,817
Night.

344
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:56,854
[sighs]

345
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,516
[bangs on barrel]
Hey.

346
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,351
- Hey!
- Sorry.

347
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,587
- Kenny!
- Hi,

348
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,389
- it's been a while.
- I know, how are you?

349
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,358
- Good, good, busy.
- Yeah.

350
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,327
That's great,
is Justin here or Carrie?

351
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,063
Yeah, out in the field
with my Mom.

352
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,498
Great.

353
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,733
I thought I'd see you
at the funeral.

354
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,436
Oh you went to the funeral?

355
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,638
Yeah, I, we
thought you'd be there.

356
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,507
Yeah, I was sick, but,

357
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,776
you went, thank you.
That's really sweet.

358
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,477
I mean you
didn't really have to go,

359
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,646
because you barely knew her,
but thank you!

360
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,649
Yeah, I just wanted to,
you're Okay?

361
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,386
I just, I really need
to go find Justin or Carrie

362
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,821
because they're
helping me with something.

363
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,525
But, thank you so much
for thinking of me

364
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,860
and congratulations on
all of this, this is so great!

365
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,596
Really good seeing you.

366
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,333
Yeah.

367
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,600
Good seeing you too.

368
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,472
This soil it'll grow anything
you've got in California,

369
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,907
- or Italy even.
- Wow.

370
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,409
Hi.

371
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,878
- Hey Darlin'.
- Hi, how are you?

372
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
- Good to see you.
- So good seeing you.

373
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,583
- You look good.
- Thank you.

374
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,453
I think I might know
what we need for the labels.

375
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,921
It's, uh, an idea.

376
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:45,363
But then I could do paintings
based on a whole collection.

377
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,833
You know, it's Heartland,
but it's like specific. Yeah?

378
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,915
I mean, either of you have
some time to come with me?

379
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,571
Um...

380
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:55,639
- The labels?
- Um hmm.

381
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:01,812
- If you guys hate the idea.
- Branding, Carrie's territory.

382
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,715
We'll cover you here, Okay?
We got time.

383
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,418
Yeah. She doesn't
want to waste her time.

384
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,533
No, this is not the place
that we should be.

385
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,701
Why not?
You afraid of old people?

386
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,539
This was our grandparents house.

387
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,046
Hi, hi.

388
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,648
We do not need to be doing this.

389
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,484
It's fine, Justin's probably
hoisted me over this fence

390
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,719
like 600 times,
it's totally fine.

391
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,455
- No
- Come on, Puss

392
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,458
I'm sorry did you
just call me a Puss-y.

393
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,993
No I called you a Puss,
it's different...

394
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,795
But you are pussy.

395
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,231
I'm not... a pussy.

396
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,866
I'll help you, turn around.

397
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,569
Jump, jump, jump.

398
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,037
[squeals]

399
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,475
Hi there.

400
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,010
You're a good dog.

401
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,918
What the fuck
are y'all doin' here?

402
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,019
Um,

403
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:52,656
do you care if my friend
and I take a few pictures

404
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,791
of you and your dogs?

405
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,761
Do you want me
to take my clothes off?

406
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,498
No thank you.

407
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,869
Well, make me look purdy.

408
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,738
Okay.
[dogs barking]

409
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,709
[gunshot]

410
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,715
[laughs]
Them's bird dogs.

411
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,049
[laughing]

412
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,054
For this it might be fine,

413
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,824
but that's just not
how branding works.

414
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,994
Hi, thank you.

415
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,797
Thanks.

416
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,933
Because then you have what,

417
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,836
six different logos
for one product?

418
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,104
Okay, just listen.

419
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,641
On the label there's
a section here,

420
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:44,708
where everything's the same

421
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,943
and then another section

422
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,546
with different art
for each type of wine.

423
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,813
Okay,

424
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,850
I like the graphic.

425
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,753
But let me just explain
a few key elements

426
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,021
to creating a brand.

427
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,757
You want Heartland.
Oklahoma, yeah?

428
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,091
This guy is Heartland.

429
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,728
Let me just have the floor
for two minutes.

430
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,863
What?

431
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,733
Let me present my side
and then you can counter,

432
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,834
the floor.

433
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,103
The floor.

434
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,606
It's a technique for
conducting business

435
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,042
that I learned in school,
we've adopted it,

436
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,910
I'm big on communicating.

437
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,979
Okay.

438
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,649
It works, gives me a chance
to express my concern,

439
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:28,719
before Justin
jumps in with a solution.

440
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,120
Just talk, I'll listen.

441
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,856
Name one successful product

442
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,892
that keeps changing
it's label design.

443
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,596
(Male) <i>Wheaties.</i>

444
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,133
Yes. Ha!

445
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,071
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

446
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,872
Yes, thank you.

447
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,843
Yeah and so then
Justin and I got together

448
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,212
and they were
super psyched because

449
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,848
of his passion for growing.

450
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,883
My parents have been
in the wine industry

451
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,886
for four generations.
So, perfect.

452
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:06,090
What if this one
is the fourth composition?

453
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,628
- Yeah, I really love that.
- Yeah?

454
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,697
I do, almost more than
the snow cone stand.

455
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,200
Yeah, I think so too.

456
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:19,236
Yeah, so then that's what
you've always wanted to do too?

457
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,976
Uh, yeah, yeah, I mean I've
always known I was going to.

458
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,911
I'm an only child, so

459
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,980
pretty much always
known that I was going to

460
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,050
inherit the company
one day and all that.

461
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:36,120
Well, I mean that's good,
takes the guess work out, right?

462
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,055
Oh yeah, yeah.

463
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,226
You know,

464
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,062
I actually one time briefly,

465
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,131
campaigned to be journalist.

466
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,099
But then my dad and I
compromised

467
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:52,136
and I just ended up
taking journalism classes

468
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,838
while double majoring in
communications and marketing.

469
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,973
All right.

470
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,010
Let's drink more.

471
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,046
Wow.

472
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,782
I should probably forego
and finish this.

473
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:08,285
And tell him to get his ass
over here to drink with me.

474
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:12,723
I will do that for you,
but he's probably sleeping.

475
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,692
He really needs his rest.

476
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,896
Watch this.

477
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,734
Okay, Puss.

478
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,771
If you can stack a tower
higher than this

479
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,040
without making it topple,

480
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,942
then no shots for you.

481
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,844
Oh, please.

482
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,783
Okay? I'll be right back.

483
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,040
Thank you.

484
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,845
[sound of cups toppling]

485
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,881
Here you go.

486
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,817
- No.
- Yup.

487
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,254
- You said one shot.
- I predict more of that.

488
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,093
- Oh my God, cheater!
- Sorry! [Laughing]

489
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,763
- Shot, now.
- Okay.

490
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,301
I hate that.

491
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,370
- No you don't.
- I do.

492
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,176
- Carrie. Carrie, serious.
- Yeah?

493
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,880
Does Justin ever
purposefully wait to poop

494
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,148
until you're in the shower?

495
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,250
[laughing]

496
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:49,319
What the fuck?
He used to do that to me.

497
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,855
Well, use a lock.

498
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,357
That's gross.

499
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,096
Do you always drink like this?

500
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,334
Stop holding your cups steady,

501
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,203
- shot.
- Oh, no.

502
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,139
Are you always
this fucking blunt?

503
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,912
No, I'm usually more tactical
than this, but you know...

504
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,917
Well, I talk sometimes.

505
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,318
Doesn't mean I have to.

506
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,021
Well it might help.

507
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:26,123
Oh? Why is that?

508
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,959
Well, like I said I'm

509
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,862
a former communications major,

510
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:34,598
and I also grew up in
a very therapized community,

511
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,033
so I'm armed...

512
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,835
- Therapized?
- and dangerous.

513
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,838
Therapized?
That's not even a word

514
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,409
- I do not like you.
- Yes you do.

515
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,345
- No I don't.
- Hey no.

516
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:52,115
- I win. I win, right?
- She does not win.

517
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,185
(Carrie) Excuse me.

518
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,924
[laughing]

519
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,326
Whoo!

520
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:06,029
This is so much fun.

521
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,432
I cannot even remember
the last time...

522
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,268
I don't even know
what time it is.

523
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,208
Can you... can you drive?

524
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,345
There's a whole lot happening
over here right now.

525
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:24,348
No, I don't know to drive
one of these things.

526
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,350
- Really?
- Yeah.

527
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,285
[laughing]

528
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,359
[crying]

529
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,428
Hey. Woah, you Okay?

530
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,965
Hey, you Okay?

531
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,204
Uh, Lauren.

532
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,976
Uhh...

533
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:56,980
Okay. Um...

534
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,448
Let's get you home.

535
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,259
[sound of vomiting]

536
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,094
[coughing/sighing]

537
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,133
[laughing]

538
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,402
Oh my God.

539
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:21,538
You're a champ Lobi,
right here. Okay.

540
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,441
I got you, I got you,
let go, let go.

541
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,245
Oh man.

542
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,513
You are a mess.

543
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,482
What'd you do?

544
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,020
(Lauren) Not funny.

545
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,255
I hate you.

546
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,360
[birds chirping]

547
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,366
I have been working on this
going on three months now

548
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:53,170
And I was saving it to be
a wedding present someday if

549
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:56,106
well... I just have
to show it to you.

550
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:01,511
- Oh, wow. That's... so...
- Thank you

551
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,180
Now previously,

552
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,415
I had always just
bought a pre-made book

553
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:10,554
but I figured if I wanted
to make a true family heirloom,

554
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,456
then from scratch
was the way to go.

555
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,392
I bought these cardboard sheets,

556
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:18,462
and I covered it with fabric.
I just love paisley.

557
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,297
And I made these little ties.

558
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,133
Oh, there he is.

559
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,537
You have the prettiest eyes.

560
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,373
Oh, thank you.

561
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,077
Oh, and here to find
these particular stencils

562
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,179
I had to join up
on a site called Etsy,

563
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,148
- have you heard of that?
- Yeah.

564
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,385
Oh, there's their daddy.

565
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,353
That's Averall.

566
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:47,290
He passed,
near 15 years ago now.

567
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,593
Grain explosion. Terrible.

568
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:52,162
Oh, I'm so sorry,

569
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:53,463
Justin told me.

570
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,136
Some people just can't
be replaced, so why try?

571
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:05,409
Oh Averall, he could calm
any tizzy just by being there.

572
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:08,145
Just taking both hands in his

573
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:14,051
and well, I'm sure
you know how it is.

574
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,353
Bitsy got hold of it.

575
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:19,156
She was a biter, but it's
one of my favorite pictures

576
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,158
so I just had to keep it in.

577
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,361
Oh, that backpack.

578
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,264
We had to look everywhere
for that exact one.

579
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,669
- Peek-a-boo
- Oh, wow!

580
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,672
- That's so creative.
- Oh, isn't that clever...

581
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,241
I can't take credit for that,

582
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,577
but Justin had a tree-house
down at the lake,

583
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,281
Their daddy put it up for them
when they were little.

584
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:47,384
You should make him show
it to you while you're here.

585
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:49,352
Has he shown you around it all?

586
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,622
Hey Carrie,
can I talk to you for a minute?

587
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,291
<i>Yeah.</i>

588
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,194
Okay. I'm so sorry,
I'll be right back.

589
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,433
What's going on?

590
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,635
Fort Worth, gotta go tonight.

591
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:10,107
Turns out one of the investor's
sure thing isn't so sure.

592
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,274
Shit.

593
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,178
Okay. So...

594
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,115
- we're leaving like now?
- No.

595
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,283
One of us has to stay here
or the tasting obviously.

596
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,154
I don't want to go back
to your dad's people.

597
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,222
I promised new guys.

598
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,224
So you're leaving?

599
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,492
Makes the most sense, yeah?

600
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:30,594
Yeah, yeah.
When do you get back?

601
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,429
Two days, Monday.

602
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,464
Okay, so I'll handle the tasting.

603
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,500
Take over catering, printing,

604
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,602
you already sent in the deposit
for the speakers right?

605
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:39,703
Already done.

606
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,576
I really wanted to be here
with Kenny, and you.

607
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,378
This was the part I was
most looking forward to

608
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,746
and now I'm gonna miss it.

609
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,583
You're perfect.

610
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,654
All right, you've got this babe.

611
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,523
- Thank you.
- Breath.

612
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:00,657
Wait, wait.

613
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,393
Wait, wait!

614
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,498
Just a little
something something.

615
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,468
(Lauren) Where's he going?
(Carrie)Fort Worth.

616
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,439
Oh.
Last night was pretty, uh...

617
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,375
It was fun right?

618
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:21,178
Even though now
I can't find my keys.

619
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,580
I drove.

620
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,516
- You drove?
- Yeah.

621
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,318
Well that was
clearly a good idea.

622
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,724
- You girls want some ice water?
- Yeah.

623
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,493
It's getting hot.

624
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,482
[faucet turns on]

625
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,564
Oh, you should add visiting
the tree-house to that list.

626
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,766
Write down,
"See Justin's tree-house,"

627
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,402
and have him take you
when he gets back.

628
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,473
Very romantic.
Or could be I think.

629
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:24,808
So add that in.

630
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:30,313
This is more of an itinerary
for the important stuff,

631
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:34,551
so I will, yes. I definitely.
Doing that now.

632
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,255
I just have to show you this.

633
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,658
This is a pillow sham

634
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,761
embroidered by Justin's
great aunt from Denver.

635
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,031
- Oh.
- Isn't that pretty?

636
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,333
(Carrie)
The stitching is so pretty.

637
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,472
Oh, Lauren,
come hang out with us.

638
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:57,507
Yeah, I want to,

639
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,277
I'm kinda behind on the labels
right now though.

640
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,678
Oh...

641
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,587
And this, this is Justin's

642
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:14,624
great great grandmother
Johnson's wedding veil.

643
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,527
They saved it
from the 1923 flood.

644
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,764
Oh, wow.

645
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,300
Great great grandmother.

646
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,737
That's on my side.
We go way back.

647
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:33,410
We kind of need to sort
through the copyright issue

648
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:37,881
- before Justin gets back.
- Oh now? Oh, Okay.

649
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,749
If it's Okay with you.

650
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,520
Oh, now go ahead,
it's way over my head.

651
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,455
Thank you so much.

652
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,529
[sighs]

653
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:53,763
I thought she was gonna pull out

654
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,900
her great great great
aunt's wedding band.

655
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,802
Oh my God, give it a day.

656
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,741
Oh, thank you.

657
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,876
You are so welcome.

658
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,568
Can you check the tub
under the bed over there

659
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,437
and see if my mom
has a graphite stick?

660
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,772
Okay..

661
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,942
No I don't see any,

662
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,910
I'm pretty sure
I know what those are.

663
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,582
Shit,

664
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,917
I kind of need some of my stuff.

665
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,537
(Lauren) <i>Hey.</i>

666
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,572
Yeah?

667
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,575
Would you want to do something
crazy with me right now?

668
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,681
[cricket chirping]

669
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,691
No, no, no, no, we could
get into so much trouble.

670
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,498
[window squeaks open]

671
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,827
Taupe?

672
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,028
Yellow?

673
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,230
Neither.

674
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,766
It looks kind of like
our stucco back home.

675
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,970
Sonoma Beige, that's fancy.

676
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,715
At least they
boxed it all up for me,

677
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:26,883
that was nice.

678
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,754
Was this yours?

679
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,624
Yeah and hers.

680
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,762
- Nicole's?
- Right

681
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,943
[toothbrush falls in box]

682
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,803
[breath out]

683
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,113
Lauren I want to live here...

684
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,156
They're just going
to paint over everything?

685
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,639
Hey.

686
00:42:56,641 --> 00:43:00,076
It would be easier
if it wasn't so dark in here.

687
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,952
[deep breath out]

688
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,024
I mean what's the etiquette?

689
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,759
It's all mostly her stuff.

690
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,127
Where's it all supposed to go?

691
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,899
Well, um, she have other family?

692
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,935
None that count.

693
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,005
Definitely belongs to you then.

694
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:32,008
Well then let's just take
what we have in here I guess.

695
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,743
It's all just stuff.

696
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,881
Well, your mom
has been through this before

697
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,717
maybe she has some ideas

698
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,052
to help you take more
and really sort through it.

699
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:46,856
She doesn't really like to talk
about that kind of thing.

700
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:48,891
- What?
- Nicole.

701
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,129
She's fine about it,
she's totally fine.

702

00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,894
- Where you going lover boy?
- Kissing Kenny.

881
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,862
Kissing Kenny.

883
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,676
[laughing]

884
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,509
[cell phone vibrates]

885
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,555
[tapping]

886
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:34,890
Carrie.

887
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,726
[tapping]

888
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,894
<i>Carrie.</i>

889
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:40,729
[tapping]

890
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,798
<i>- Carrie.
- Yup?</i>

891
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,768
- Hi, uh...
- Oh my God, my head.

892
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,805
Yeah, hey, Justin
just called eh...

893
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,476
No, no, no,
don't say anything. Uh...

894
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:56,678
I won't tell him
about the one before.

895
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,813
Before?

896
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,549
Shit.

897
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,984
I can't find my phone.

898
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,889
- Are there a dozen there?
- I think there are thirteen.

899
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:09,758
I still got a couple more
boxes in the trunk.

900
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,794
I never did get
Paulette to sign up.

901
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:15,197
Oh just keep her in your
back pocket, hon, you'll see.

902
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,567
Once you and Lauren start
making sales, it'll be fine.

903
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:19,635
[knocking]

904
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:20,869
Oh.

905
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,939
Oh, hi! Come on in.

906
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,607
So good to see you.

907
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,643
You girls,
you remember Kenny right?

908
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:30,479
- Hi there.
- Look at you tall boy!

909
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,616
Did you come by to visit Lauren?

910
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,719
No I actually found
this in my truck, Carrie's.

911
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,655
Oh well she's asleep
up in Justin's room,

912
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,023
you can go on up
just slip it under the door.

913
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:44,760
Lauren's been working
real hard on those drawings

914
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:46,562
you should take a look.

915
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:47,696
Okay.

916
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,933
He knows the way.

917
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:52,734
He's such a cutie!

918
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,938
It's not anywhere.

919
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,574
And he didn't leave a message?

920
00:57:58,576 --> 00:58:01,944
No, oh God, I did not
remember the one before.

921
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:05,881
- Did anyone see?
- No, no, no. Oh God, oh God.

922
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:10,652
Okay, nothing even
really happened so,

923
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,820
it doesn't have to get weird.

924
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:13,755
[knocking]

925
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,663
Hey I'm sure he was just calling
to see how everything went,

926
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,532
all right you can call him
back on my phone if you...

927
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:24,066
[knocking]

928
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:26,034
Yeah? Come in.

929
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,572
What are you doing here?

930
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,107
I brought Carrie's phone
and your Vespa back,

931
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:35,511
but your mom said you wanted
to show me some drawings?

932
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,281
Oh, God no, she's...
no, never mind,

933
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,884
- she's... that's just my mom.
- Everything Okay?

934
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:43,685
Yeah, uh...
[phone vibrates]

935
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,787
Can we not do this right now?

936
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,624
Yeah, yeah, sure.

937
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,025
(Justin) <i>Call me, call me.</i>

938
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,796
<i>He's in,
thought you'd wanna hear.</i>

939
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,967
<i>Call me.
Wanna tell you about it.</i>

940
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,804
<i>Kenny said your home safe
and that all went well</i>

941
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:06,775
<i>and the investors loved it,
so, it's a go,</i>

942
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:07,910
<i>huge day!</i>

943
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,945
<i>Can you call me?</i>

944
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,153
(Carrie) <i>It's not like I</i>
<i>purposefully didn't call you,</i>

945
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:21,623
and the second I found it
I called you back.

946
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:22,758
Okay, you don't need
to get so defensive.

947
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,928
It's just really hard to be two
places at once as a team,

948
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,030
<i>- if we can't communicate.
- Trust me, I know.</i>

949
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,899
And it was a really
unfortunate day for an incident.

950
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,334
Justin!

951
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:34,636
Nothing went wrong,
I dropped my phone

952
00:59:34,638 --> 00:59:37,739
and that is the only thing
that varied minutely from

953
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,141
all the details
that we discussed,

954
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,809
and planned,
and discussed again.

955
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:43,145
<i>Let's not get upset.
[sighs]</i>

956
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:45,814
[tornado siren]
Uh...

957
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:47,049
<i>We can discuss it,</i>

958
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,051
we'll share the floor
when I get back.

959
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:52,120
Just keep your phone
on you is all, Okay?

960
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:54,790
I'm keeping my phone on.
Is that a tornado?

961
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,692
Does that mean that
there's a tornado outside?

962
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:57,826
What's going on?

963
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,161
There's a siren.

964
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:01,730
All right it'll be Okay,
just find my mom.

965
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,668
Carrie? Carrie, hello?
[beeping]

966
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,204
Justin? Hello?
[beeping]

967
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,740
Hello?
[tornado siren]

968
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,077
You hear them sirens?

969
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:17,079
The Dogs'll be
peein' on the couch.

970
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,614
I gotta call home.

971
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:20,749
Mom?

972
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,920
Oh, bless her heart.
[laughing]

973
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,991
Lauren, go grab a mattress
and y'all two take the tub.

974
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:30,959
It'll be alright darlin'.

975
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,961
I think this
is her first tornado.

976
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,898
[tornado siren]

977
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,704
Oh God...

978
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,172
Wouldn't I be safer
away from the wall?

979
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,907
It seems safer where you are.

980
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,210
The whole room's built
in the center of the house,

981
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,645
we're safe.

982
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,214
Dorothy did not get into a tub.

983
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,182
Well Dorothy wound up in Oz.

984
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,987
- Ow.
- Sorry!

985
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:02,858
- Okay, here.
- No, no, no, no, no

986
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,260
You don't need this. Here.

987
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:11,066
We've never actually
had one touch down here.

988
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,202
[loud thunder crack]

989
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,839
Oh my God, oh my God.

990
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,875
- Do you wanna trade places?
- Uh huh.

991
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,011
No, no, no, please stay.

992
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,847
Okay.

993
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,849
Here.

994
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,859
Is that better?

995
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,163
Yeah, that's better.

996
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:44,833
Sorry, I'm...

997
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:46,101
just gonna...

[thunder]

999
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,912
You can tell how far away
the storm is by

1000
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:58,914
counting the seconds
after you see lightening

1001
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,749
until you hear the thunder

1002
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:03,852
and that's how
many miles away it is.

1003
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:07,956
Of course, we don't
see any lightening.

1004
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,797
[thunder]
Sorry.

1005
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,768
It's Okay...

1006
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,339
I don't mind.

1007
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:28,210
[thunder]

1008
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:30,045
You still scared?

You girls got flashlights?

1024
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,219
It's Okay, we have our phones.

<i>Y'all survive it?</i>

1026
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,161
Yeah, we're good.

1027
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,230
Hi.

1028
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,533
Bless her heart.

1029
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,335
Yeah, they're just fine,

1030
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:16,438
just had a little wind is all,
and some hail.

1031
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,974
Oh, sweetie, you wanna
speak to Justin?

1032
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:23,178
Tell him,
I'll talk to him later.

1033
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,412
- Okay.
- Hi, Justin!

1034
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:27,215
- Hey Justin.
- Hey.

1035
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:31,987
Yeah, everything's just fine.
Yeah, it's all good.

1036
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,489
<i>All right, here you go.</i>

1037
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,395
It's really good.

1038
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,530
- Yeah?
- Isn't it?

1039
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:47,135
And it's jammed packed
with antioxidants.

1040
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:50,238
And Phyto nutrients
in digestible form.

1041
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,342
My daughter got married
a year and a half ago,

1042
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,477
how'd y'all meet?

1043
01:06:55,479 --> 01:07:02,350
Oh we, his internship, he...
at my parents vineyard.

1044
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,618
Well we know that.

1045
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:10,525
Yup, you do.
We, that's, yeah my dad...

1046
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,161
really liked him
and sort of adopted him.

1047
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:17,599
And... so he was
just around a lot and...

1048
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,468
we just, you know,
kind of kept crossing...

1049
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,806
- Paths?
- Paths, yup,

1050
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:26,441
and I still remember
the first time I...

1051
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,510
Oh when are y'all
just gonna get married?

1052
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:30,412
[laughing]

1053
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:34,349
You know, my son
got married four years back.

1054
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:36,351
Now I got two grand-babies.

1055

1056
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,360
I'm so, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1057
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,532
This provides
a terrific opportunity

1058
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:54,269
<i>to supplement
a husband's income.</i>

1059
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,106
Yeah, just gotta get everyone
to drink the kool-aid.

1060
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,374
[laughing]

1061
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:01,543
Now, it isn't kool-aid.

1062
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,579
Tell her why.

1063
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:08,216
Oh, well, um...

1064
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,286
Dynamic essentials.

1065
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:13,254
Kool-aid doesn't have
dynamic essentials

1066
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:17,425
Whenever somebody compares
Vitamade to an inferior product,

1067
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,562
you jump right in and you
explain what makes our distinct.

1068
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:23,465
I was just kidding,
I was just referring to...

1069
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,267
No wonder
you're only second tier.

1070
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:27,869
I signed her up 8 months ago.

1071
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:30,271
By then,
I was already peach diamond.

1072
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,374
Well, could be that working
with dementia patients

1073
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:36,411
is kind of edging out the
pyramid scheme at the moment.

1074
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:40,682
Maybe they could use some
dynamic essentials too.

1075
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:42,517
[laughing]

1076
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,520
(Carrie) <i>I'm so... So sorry.</i>

1077
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:47,689
I don't know
what's gotten into me.

1078
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,626
I'm sorry.
[laughing]

1079
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,495
<i>I'll be right back.
[laughing]</i>

1080
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:55,330
I'm so happy that you're showing

1081
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:57,665
this sudden respect
for your mom, Lauren.

1082
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,169
<i>It's a long time prayer of mine.</i>

1083
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,471
You gave her a lot of grief,

1084
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,709
but now it's really nice.

1085
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,611
Please explain.

1086
01:09:09,613 --> 01:09:13,214
No, it's none of my business.

1087
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:16,384
- It seems like it is.
- Lauren, now

1088
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,587
I have something for you Sherri.

1089
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,392
I have a magic ingredient

1090
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,461
that's really
gonna help your sales.

1091
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:30,598
Lauren, go to your
room this instant.

1092
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,169
- Go to my room?
- Get out of here now!

1093
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,607
I'm sorry, you can stay. Gail,

1094
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,477
you can stay, please, Sherri.

1095
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,381
Oh, Lauren!

1096
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:50,251
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

1097
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,454
(Lauren) <i>Who gives a shit</i>
<i>what they think?</i>

1098
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:56,291
(Crystal)
<i>I care those are my friends</i>

1099
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:58,426
and let me tell you
something Missy,

1100
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:01,196
there wasn't a meal you ate
after your daddy died

1101
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:02,697
that those women
didn't fix for you.

1102
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:06,434
Fine, but I...
I was defending you.

1103
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:08,436
Why can't you just take my side?

1104
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:12,340
(Crystal) <i>I defend you</i>
<i>all the time. Believe me.</i>

1105
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,379
<i>Babe, you survived
your first tornado warning,</i>

1106
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,348
<i>- I'm so proud.
- Yeah, I...</i>

1107
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,983
<i>It's a serious right of passage,</i>

1108
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:23,351
<i>kind of fun though right?</i>

1109
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:26,421
Babe, can we go ahead and
book our flights back yet?

1110
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:31,659
Who's hungry? Surprise!
Surprise babe!

1111
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,595
Congratulations.

1112
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,366
Look what I brought
for us to celebrate.

1113
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,570
- Oh boy.
- Oh, look who's here.

1114
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:43,671
Mom!

1115
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:48,309
- Oh no, we gotta celebrate.
- Come on, let's eat.

1116
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:49,377
I'm hungry.

1117
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,479
That tornado took it out of me.

1118
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:57,518
Book a cabin on lake
Eufala next weekend,

1119
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,254
<i>see if Kenny can
bring his boat down</i>

1120
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:01,322
<i>and teach Carrie
how to fly fish.</i>

1121
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:04,492
Mom you think you could get
couple days off of work?

1122
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:08,496
- Well I could sure try.
- Tell them we're celebrating.

1123
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:09,797
Y'all scooch together.

1124
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,533
<i>Lauren, get over there.</i>

1125
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:15,703
<i>Get over there next
to Carrie now, right now.</i>

1126
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,606
She's practically
your sister after all.

1127
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:19,674
Mom!

1128
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:22,677
I know.

1129
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,680
<i>Squeeze in there Lauren,
squeeze in.</i>

1130
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:28,750
<i>One, two three... yeah.</i>

1131
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,419
Oh that's darlin', look at that.

1132
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:32,687
Oh, that's so great.

1133
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:34,889
We should probably
head back soon now.

1134
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,491
We don't want
to leave my parents

1135
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:38,059
carrying the load
of opening the new branch.

1136
01:11:38,061 --> 01:11:40,428
But I wanted to be here
to help Kenny,

1137
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,463
at least through bottling.

1138
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,766
- We have several weeks...
- Weeks?

1139
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:47,402
We'll discuss it later
and I'll talk to your dad.

1140
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,771
How are the labels coming Lobi?

1141
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:54,676
Great! They're great.
I'm gonna go finish those.

1142
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,744
Lauren, you didn't
even eat anything.

1143
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:58,446
I'm not hungry!

1144
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,717
She's so skinny,
she's gonna blow away.

1145
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,687
Mom, no tornado jokes.
[laughing]

1146
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,765
[text message alert]

1147
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,873
You awake?

1148
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,529
Look, I know

1149
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,598
I know you're not.

1150
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,368
I don't want you
to think that I'm like,

1151
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,970
but now you're
in this big hurry to leave

1152
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:59,440
and I don't want to not
ever see you, and, and,

1153
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:00,641
you won't even look at me.

1154
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:04,479
No, it's not because of you,
it's just,

1155
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:05,913
what happened,

1156
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:09,650
- that can't happen.
- No, that, that won't happen.

1157
01:13:09,652 --> 01:13:12,754
And Justin cannot ever know.

1158
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:15,456
Justin, no, Justin cannot.

1159
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,459
I would never, just,
I am so sorry,

1160
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:19,660
but are you like, so freaked out

1161
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:21,996
that you never want
to see me again?

1162
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,531
No.

1163
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:25,933
No.

1164
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,736
We're good.

1165
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:33,708
Good, cause
it's meant a lot to me

1166
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:38,746
that, you know,
not like that, just...

1167
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:42,750
and I don't want to have like,
fucked all that up.

1168
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,552
Or for you and Justin either.

1169
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:48,856
No, No, Justin and I
are gonna be fine.

1170
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:52,727
That's, that
is all good. Okay?

1171
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:56,898
People freak out, you know?

1172
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,001
- Uh, and I fucked up.
- No.

1173
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:03,738
Yes, commitment is...

1174
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,908
commitment is really, um...

1175
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,444
It happens, you know?

1176
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:12,046
And that does not mean that
Justin and I aren't gonna...

1177
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,452
Shit...

1178
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,555
Okay.

1179
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,023
- Yeah, I really should go.
- Yeah, go.

1180
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:24,058
I should go, but this
is not because of you,

1181
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,995
it's just because I...
really don't belong here.

1182
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,731
I get it.

1183
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,074
[sighs]

1184
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,045
[sighs]

1185
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,818
[gasps]

1186
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,054
Oh, you scared me.

1187
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:54,755
What am I not
supposed to find out?

1188
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,827
- What?
- The vent, I, I heard.

1189
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,730
You guys seemed super upset,

1190
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:04,765
what did you fuck up?

1191
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,536
Just, uh, the labels.

1192
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:09,804
Shit...

1193
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:12,607
I know...

1194
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,744
- Hang on, I'll handle it Okay?
- No, no.

1195
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:18,646
No, Justin, Lauren, um,

1196
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:21,716
I just told her
and she's pretty upset.

1197
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:25,720
So, I, I, I handled it.

1198
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:29,624
- No it's gonna be Okay.
- No, Justin, I handled it.

1199
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,659
- It's gonna be Okay.
- Justin, I handled it.

1200
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,662
[knocking]
Lauren?

1201
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:35,763
God.
[knocking]

1202
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,064
Lauren?

1203
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,569
I know,
I shouldn't have done that.

1204
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:43,804
Done?

1205
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,640
Lied about the labels.

1206
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,643
(Lauren) <i>Oh, don't,</i>
<i>it's Okay, don't worry.</i>

1207
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:52,713
No, I should've said something.
I'm really sorry.

1208
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:57,752
No, I really, don't worry.
Really, really, it's...

1209
01:15:57,754 --> 01:15:59,854
But Carrie said you were upset

1210
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:01,956
and then you guys had
this intense conversation.

1211
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,959
- So, are you?
- Yeah, I mean, yeah,

1212
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,794
I'm angry Justin!

1213
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,729
Like what was that, honestly?

1214
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:11,165
Justin, was that some kind
of like, pity assignment?

1215
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:14,835
I thought it would give you
something to take your mind off,

1216
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:18,005
I don't know, and then it
turned into a big lie, and...

1217
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:19,040
<i>Yeah, it's fine.</i>

1218
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:22,743
that Carrie had
nothing to do with it.

1219
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:25,646
She tried to tell me and look,
look, her dad uses

1220
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:27,081
- Got it, got it.
- No, her dad uses the same guy

1221
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,184
- maybe we can talk to him, yeah?
- Yeah, maybe.

1222
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:33,054
And I'm, I'm sorry
that Carrie had to tell you,

1223
01:16:33,056 --> 01:16:38,125
Fine! Just, it's fine,
let's move on.

1224
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:40,127
No, I don't want
you to be upset.

1225
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,063
Justin, it was
my fault too, Okay?

1226
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:45,132
I should've... I should've
told you that I knew, so...

1227
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,668
But, but, Carrie just told you.

1228
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,673
Okay, what's going on?

1229
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:56,644
<i>Carrie. Carrie please. Baby.
[crying]</i>

1230
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:58,713
I'm so sorry.

1231
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,683
<i>What happened?</i>

1232
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,053
It wasn't a planned thing.

1233
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,160
No.

1234
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,198
No, no, no.
(Carrie) <i>Please forgive me.</i>

1235
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:21,035
There's no way, there's no way.

1236
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:22,970
Are you kidding?

1237
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,672
(Carrie) <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1238
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:26,741
(Justin) <i>No!</i>

1239
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,010
That's my little sister!

1240
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:35,116
Oh, you better believe
it's not going to happen again.

1241
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:38,119
I mean, how did it even get to
this point? I was two days!

1242
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:41,088
- A lot happened.
- Are you kidding me?

1243
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:41,989
I don't get it.

1244
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,091
I, I can't. Oh my God.

1245
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,827
- Justin!
- No.

1246
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,729
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- No, hey let me talk to him.

1247
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:51,666
Lauren, please.
It's between me and Justin...

1248
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,771
Lauren, what the fuck
were you thinking?

1249
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,139
Stop it. I wasn't!

1250
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:01,442
Too bad Nicole's not around,
I could even the score.

1251
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:04,211
You don't say shit
about her, you hear me?

1252
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:06,881
You were happy to be off
making your big important deals.

1253
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:08,049
You were too busy for us.

1254
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:11,719
Yes, I was busy.
I told you I'd be busy.

1255
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:13,954
I am sorry your
girlfriend's dead.

1256
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,289
Doesn't mean you get mine.

1257
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,225
Got it, Justin.
You're very important.

1258
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,094
I'm just gonna try
to stay out of your way.

1259
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:22,163
No! You do not get
to twist this around.

1260
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,465
You think I like
kissing ass all day?

1261
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:27,835
Fuck you!
People make sacrifices!

1262
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,237
Justin, you apologize
right this second.

1263
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,972
Mom, go back to bed.

1264
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:35,076
No sir, no siree bob,
I'll do nothing of the kind.

1265
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:38,112
You apologize your sister
right this minute.

1266
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:40,948
Okay I'm sorry,

1267
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:44,985
just so sorry, that you
slept with my girlfriend!

1268
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:46,153
(Carrie) <i>Justin!</i>

1269
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,056
Okay we are not children,

1270
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,292
I think we should talk
about this like adults.

1271
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:55,329
- Please take the floor.
- Okay.

1272
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,164
Something happened

1273
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,134
and Lauren hasn't
really been in,

1274
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:04,171
(Justin) <i>To fuck her?</i>
<i>Feel sorry for me? No.</i>

1275
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:06,107
That's not what happened

1276
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:08,109
- That is not what happened.
- Lauren is this true?

1277
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:10,778
Two days! How?

1278
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:13,814
I mean it was only
two days, right?

1279
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:17,351
(Justin) <i>Do you need a shrink?</i>
<i>I'm finding you a shrink.</i>

1280
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:19,253
- Justin!
- No, Google's great for this,

1281
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,888
I'm worried, Carrie thinks
you need someone.

1282
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,189
- Justin!
- We are not children!

1283
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:24,959
- Stop it!
- Let go! Justin!

1284
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,961
Ow, God!

1285
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,930
- Why are you taking her side?
- I'm not.

1286
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:34,101
Whatever, I'm done.
You can have her.

1287
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,338
Please, I want you,
please let's go back to Napa,

1288
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:41,308
Did you do this thing?
Lauren, did you?

1289
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,043
Lauren just needed somebody,
to be there for her

1290
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:44,845
- Stop! I don't...
- Oh my God, its such bullshit,

1291
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:47,915
- I'm going Justin.
- Go, you're so fucked.

1292
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,183
- Language.
- You're fucked!

1293
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:50,184
- You are!
- You are!

- You are!
- You're fucked!

Stop it, that's enough,
out of both of you.

1296
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:59,059
This is the last straw.

1297
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,997
I have, I have been forgiving,
and I tolerated that...

1298
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:04,365
thing with that friend of yours.

1299
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:06,901
Mom, nobody really
likes being tolerated.

1300
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:08,369
Great, now I'm defending you.

I tried to help you.
I gave you a place to stay,

1303

I tried to get you work,
I made you meals.

1304

Yeah, you're great.

1305

that you're a bigot?

01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:44,038
Hey, is it cool if I chill
with you for a little bit?

1308
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,373
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Thank you.

1309

- Everything Okay?
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1310

I just uh... is it Okay
if I chill here with you?

1311
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:56,083
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh my God, it's late.

1312
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,985
- Yeah.
- Were you asleep?

1313
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,286
- No, not yet.
- Oh, good.

1314
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,990
Um, oh, no, no
I'm good, thank you.

1315
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:05,359
Okay. Just make
yourself at home.

1316

Thank you.

your place before.

- No, I'm fine. I'm fine Kenny.
- No, you're obviously...

You keep acting
like nothing happened.

1332

It's fucked up.

What do you want, me to cry
for the rest of my life?

1334

No, you don't get to tell me
how to handle this. No!

1335
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:05,319
I was there,
I was there for all of it,

1336
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,688
I was there to remind her
what her catheter was,

1337
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:10,224
every time she
tried to take it out

1338
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,393
and I was there
to rock her when it hurt,

1339
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:14,361
because she would do it anyway!

1340
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:17,398
I was there to shave her legs
in the bathroom sink

1341
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,100
when she still cared
what the nurses thought.

1342
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,969
And I was there to feed her,

1343
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:24,138
when she didn't care
about anyone else.

1344
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,472
At all. Okay?

1345
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:29,276

don't make the mistake of

1350
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:47,461
it was just a one time thing.

I'll call your dad,
I'll let him know.

You always do this.
You jump to a solution.

Isn't that one of
the off-limit words

in your communications rulebook?

1355
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:03,277
Effective communication
makes for a strong team, Justin.

1356
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:05,179
This is a strong team?

1357
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:07,047
Yes, are you kidding me?

1358
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,318
Babe, we convinced
four Napa bred investors

1359
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,989
to buy into a vineyard
in Oklahoma.

- Go us.

- That's not...
- And fuck you,

I'm so glad to hear
my dream of local wine

1363
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:26,066
is so preposterous to you.
Not surprised.

1364
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:29,336
You made it very clear
how much you hate it here.

1365
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,171
Why don't you just decide
where all the branches go.

1366
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:34,041
Justin, I don't care where the
branches go, I honestly don't.

1367
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:36,443
Well I do care!
I care about this branch.

1368

I know you do,
and of course I care. I just,

everything in my power

1370

What future are we
talking about right now?

1374

Are we talking about business
or are we talking about us?

a line Carrie, either side...

- this is the problem

- just listen.
- Oh, is that it? Lauren listens?

(Female) <i>Three bedroom,</i>
<i>one bath and the last tenant...</i>

1391
01:26:35,591 --> 01:26:36,657
[door opens]

1392
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,799
(Carrie) <i>It just doesn't</i>
<i>make sense anymore,</i>

1393
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:48,635
<i>for him to come back with me.</i>

1394
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:51,338
I've had more with you,

1395
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,740
than I've had
in two years with Justin.

1396
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:56,577
I just feel like,
if you guys tried

1397
01:26:56,579 --> 01:26:59,413
- then maybe.
- I don't want to.

1398
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,257
You know that none of this

1399
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:12,626
was ever about
feeling sorry for you, right?

1400
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,829
Yeah I do.

1401
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:25,439
I've just been such a mess

1402
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:26,773
and

1403
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:31,712
I'm really glad
that you were here.

1404
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:36,283
Me too.

1405
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,387
[car pulls up]

1406
01:29:01,403 --> 01:29:03,937
Justin, Justin. I know
you don't want me here,

1407
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:06,773
I'm not going to stay,
I promise you, Okay?

1408
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:09,109
I did these for you.
And you haven't seen them,

1409
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:11,745
I just want you to,
just have them.

1410
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:28,695
It's mostly stuff you showed me,

1411
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,931
and places we went
when we were kids.

1412
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:34,534
This one's great.
[paper tearing]

1413
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:46,880
No thanks.

1414
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:06,500
I was gonna be head
of the whole Midwest operation.

1415
01:30:06,502 --> 01:30:08,869
The whole thing, you know?

1416
01:30:08,871 --> 01:30:10,537
Could've been a big deal.

1417
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:11,972
- Still can be.
- No, no.

1418
01:30:11,974 --> 01:30:14,674
- We had a three year plan to...
- You know what I think?

1419
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:18,545
I think this whole thing,
this whole fiasco

1420
01:30:18,547 --> 01:30:19,746
sort of saved you
from becoming a...

1421
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,481
Oh God, have you been
talking to her?

1422
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:23,483
No, I have been watching you,

1423
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:25,018
on the rare occasions
you're around

1424
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,853
stressed as fuck over some shit

1425
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:29,756
that I know you
couldn't care less about.

1426
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:30,857
We worked very hard.

1427
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:32,893
Tell me you're
happier in a board room

1428
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:35,929
talking quarterly bullshit
than you are

1429
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:37,464
right here.

1430
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,502
I mean, if you're really
into it though, you know,

1431
01:30:42,504 --> 01:30:43,837
tell me to shut up.

1432
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:50,977
[birds chirping]

1433
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:56,716
Come on.

1434
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:04,591
Kenny told me you were here.

1435
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:08,495
<i>I was surprised.</i>

1436
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,636
I don't know how to,

1437
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:17,537
[deep breath]

1438
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:19,673
I am so sorry.

1439
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:22,609
I know that's not enough,
I know.

1440
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:26,613
I know it's enough, but I am.

1441
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,746
<i>Chapter one.</i>

1442
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:03,683
<i>Once in a kingdom
called Delaine,</i>

1443
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,919
there was a king with two sons.

1444
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:07,988
Delaine was a very old kingdom

1445
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,623
and it had hundreds of kings,

1446
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,725
perhaps even thousands.

1447
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:13,059
<i>When time goes on long enough</i>

1448
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:15,996
not even historians
can remember everything.

1449
01:32:15,998 --> 01:32:17,864
Roland the Good
was neither the best

1450
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,600
nor the worst king
ever to rule the land.

1451
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,974
He tried very hard
not to do anyone great evil

1452
01:32:27,976 --> 01:32:30,043
and mostly succeeded.

1453
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,579
He also tried very hard
to do great works,

1454
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:35,715
<i>but unfortunately he didn't
succeed so well at that.</i>

1455
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:38,151
<i>The result was
a very mediocre king.</i>

1456
01:32:38,153 --> 01:32:41,621
be remembered
long after he was dead.

1457
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,113
[boxes sliding]

1458
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:14,020
[knocking]

1459
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:24,030
Lauren.

1460
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:25,665
Did you lose your key?

1461
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:27,667
Um, no.

1462
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:29,636
Good.

1463
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:34,207
I came to get my boxes,

1464
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:36,943
and I wanted to tell you
that I was sorry...

1465
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,113
and stuff.

1466
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:43,883
Is Justin here?

1467
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:46,186
He is.

1468
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:49,189
Okay.

1469
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,960
That's for you.

1470
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,633
Well, thank you.

1471
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:04,904
- Okay bye.
- Take care.

1472
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:07,674
Can I ask you?

1473
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:11,911
When Nicole was dying,

1474
01:34:11,913 --> 01:34:14,781
why didn't you just
come to the hospital?

1475
01:34:14,783 --> 01:34:17,651
Oh, honey, I told you

1476
01:34:17,653 --> 01:34:20,987
- I tried, more than once.
- Yeah,

1477
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,856
but I needed you there with me.

1478
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:27,761
Oh, honey she was
your friend, not mine.

1479
01:34:27,763 --> 01:34:29,129
My girlfriend.

1480
01:34:29,131 --> 01:34:32,198
Oh for pity's sake, Lauren,
do we have to do this?

1481
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,103
No.

1482
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,907
Bye Mom.
