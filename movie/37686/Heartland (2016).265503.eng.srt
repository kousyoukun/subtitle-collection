00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,978
how long the branch
set up here would take.

176
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
-So, no flights booked back yet.
-Yay!

177
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,215
(Lauren) <i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>it's actually happening</i>

178
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,217
Justin has been
talking about this forever.

179
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,018
Yeah, but my parents

180
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,854
will probably need us
back in Napa soon,

181
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,756
we're part of the
headquarters team,

182
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,758
but Kenny will run
the Vineyard here,

183
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,060
once it's set up, so thankfully
we don't have to stay.

184
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,866
But, we will
be be back and forth

185
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:51,770
I'm sure, and visiting a lot.

186
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,073
You just do
what you need to do,

187
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:59,310
things were hectic for Averall
and I too at your age,

188
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,247
you've got each other and some
day you'll have more time.

189
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,884
Yeah, we really
work well together,

190
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,986
it helps with the chaos.

191
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,021
Oh, I understand,

192
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,091
such a blessing and you'd
be surprised how many people

193
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,193
never wind up finding that.

194
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,803
Lauren, Justin told me
about Nicole, I'm so sorry.

195
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,271
Oh, thank you.

196
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,406
Yeah, I just can't even imagine.

197
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,810
<i>You know,</i>
<i>to be one of those that</i>

198
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,812
has found what you were saying,

199
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:37,949
I... it's just not fair.

200
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,820
Well, that's not really
what I was meaning.

201
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,222
But,
she was a real good friend.

202
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,392
Thank you.

203
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,031
Lobi Kenobi!

204
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,968
-Just fixing this real quick.
-Fun.

205
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,905
Don't want Carrie thinking,
you know,

206
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,407
going for charming
over hillbilly.

207
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,411
Hoping to win her over

208
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,213
to the dark side.

209
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,882
[Darth Vader imitation]

210
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,619
<i>Oh my gosh.</i>

211
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,020
Let me see those.

212
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,962
Ok, these earrings you added
kind of look like sperm now.

213
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,232
Yeah a little bit.

214
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,202
You wanna play?

215
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,270
Yeah.

216
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,440
-Take five.
-Ok.

217
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,177
All right, all right.

218
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,980
Do you have the guy who

219
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,183
is required to remain 200 feet
away from playgrounds?

220
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,355
-That guy?
-Yup, that's him.

221
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,360
You been...uh

222
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,296
You been OK?

223
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,965
Yeah I've been totally OK.
You have?

224
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,001
I really thought the timing
was gonna work out,

225
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,303
and we'd be here.

226
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,039
But, it all happened
so quick at the end.

227
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,110
I'm so sorry.
She was so great.

228
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,346
5pm, yeah, 5pm, right.

229
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,148
Sorry Lobi, can we...

230
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,182
Can we finish later?

231
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,920
We're on a really tight leash
right now and this designer

232
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,988
is taking his sweet time
with the labels.

233
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,190
Labels? Wine labels?

234
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:30,428
Yes, we will send them over
immediately, thank you.

235
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,330
[sighs]

236
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,133
I mean, I can help
you guys out with that.

237
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,168
If you have something already,
that's totally fine,

238
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,004
but you know that's what I do.

239
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,139
Well...

240
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,174
I'd love to help you guys out

241
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,012
Yeah.
You wanna take a crack at it?

242
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:54,018
There, we actually have
some bids out already, so...

243
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,286
Right, there are some bids out,

244
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,356
but we haven't
settled on anything yet.

245
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,959
Great, just tell me
what you guys want.

246
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,295
-I mean if it sounds fun,yeah?
-Yeah.

247
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,297
Yeah.

248
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,539
Stacy, Stacy, look who's here.

249
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,042
-And look.
-Oh my God, I can't believe it

250
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,347
(Crystal) <i>Wait until you see</i>
<i>Heather, she's about to pop.</i>

251
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,084
Good to see you.

252
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,286
Hi how are you,Heather?

253
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,988
Hey!

254
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,589
Well hello stranger,
how are you?

255
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,492
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

256
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,230
I got both of my kids back,
I got Lauren and Justin.

257
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,033
Who has the "J"?
Think jelly bean.

258
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,134
(Justin)
<i>And this little local start up</i>

259
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,403
that Kenny and I
had in mind years ago,

260
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,772
well it could turn into
something pretty legit.

261
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,341
Once we convince the investors
to take a chance here,

262
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,443
Missouri and Kansas are next.

263
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,379
Lauren and Kenny used to go out.

264
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:58,016
-Right, I remember.
-Oh, I met him didn't I?

265
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,184
Carrie's been marketing
wine tastings for her family

266
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,320
since she was like a teenager,

267
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,354
tell em babe.

268
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,057
That's right, since I was a kid.

269
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,159
You don't drink
that stuff do ya?

270
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,131
I got dirty.

271
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,199
Now, why'd you do that?
Come here.

272
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,468
Lauren this might be
something good for you to do,

273
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,304
-we could sell it together.
-Yeah maybe so.

274
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,273
No, you all could be a lot
more generous than that

275
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,275
with your pours, I got plenty.

276
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,352
Excuse me,
really good seeing you.

277
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,389
Oh,

278
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,060
this place wasn't really built
with reception in mind, was it?

279
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,494
Nope, probably not.

280
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,499
-Feeling overdressed?
-They said party.

281
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,335
[sighs]

282
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,675
So, I've had vodka all along.

283
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,243
Don't tell anybody

284
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,313
Thank God.

285
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,853
I just wanna make sure
we get a prayer in,

286
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,155
before people start
needing to leave.

287
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,491
I know we've got bed times
for some of our little ones.

288
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,194
Also, I want to say
how excited we are

289
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,162
to welcome back
a few of our own.

290
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:23,134
Lauren, and Justin, and Carrie,
it's also so great to have you.

291
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:28,172
Justin, I was wondering if
you'd mind leading us in prayer?

292
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,641
I'd love to, yeah, OK.

293
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,311
Um, well it's really great
to be back,

294
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,179
miss seeing a lot of your faces

295
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,681
some not so much.

296
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,183
-Oh, he didn't mean that
-I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

297
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,385
So let's go ahead and pray
before I make a fool of myself.

298
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,724
We just want to thank you
so much for this opportunity

299
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,327
<i>to come together</i>
<i>friends and family,</i>

300
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,463
<i>to just celebrate the day,</i>
<i>and life, and...</i>

301
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,199
I pray that you bless all of us
<i>as we head out of here today,</i>

302
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,202
keep us all safe,
in the days and weeks to come.

303
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,571
We love you.
In your holy name we pray. Amen.

304
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,607
-Amen.
-Go Sooners!

305
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,277
And the decanter
was a total bust,

306
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,512
I felt like an idiot.

307
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,913
We don't drink wine.

308
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,249
Well, I wish I had known that.

309
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,750
It didn't even
occur to me babe.

310
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,654
I promise, she didn't think...

311
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,391
-it's not a big deal, I promise.
-Well, to me, it... I just,

312
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,193
I want them to like me.

313
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,563
-Never mind.
-They do, I can tell.

314
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,933
It's fine.
But Justin, the labels.

315
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:33,337
-they're already on their way...
-Shhh, stop, stop.

316
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,175
-The vent. She can hear you.
-OK.

317
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,779
No, it's fine, you can tell me,
just do it quietly.

318
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,652
You know that the labels
are ready for shipping

319
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,254
and that my Dad
usually uses the same guy

320
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,257
-Why would you tell Lauren?
-You saw her face,

321
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,593
this will help her take her
mind off of all the other stuff

322
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,795
and then we'll just tell her
that your Dad uses a...

323
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:01,632
You know what, you're right.
It's not a big deal.

324
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,735
Sounds like it is.

325
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:09,640
Here, take the floor,
state your case, babe.

326
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,414
I just think... maybe

327
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,317
Lauren doesn't need
the distraction, I mean,

328
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,286
maybe you should just
let her feel it instead...

329
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,354
Here you go.

330
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,589
There's a wash cloth here,

331
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,490
you just gotta shove it
in the drain hole

332
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,725
if you need to take a bath.

333
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,594
Oh, thank you.

334
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,662
And I'm leaving
a night light on in the hall

335
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,231
in case you have to pee-pee.

336
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,367
-Thank you.
-Okey-dokey, well good night.

337
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,302
Justin, I fixing up the couch

338
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,305
-Oh, Mom let me do that.
-The couch?

339
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,342
Yeah, yeah, that's just
how it's done here.

340
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,776
Listen, can you set
a backup alarm for eight?

341
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,311
We have to be up
and at Kenny's by...

342
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,713
10, I have two set already.

343
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,548
You're perfect.

344
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,817

-Yeah?
-Isn't it?

And it's jammed packed
with antioxidants.

1053
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:50,238
And phyto nutrients

1054
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,342
My daughter got married
a year and a half ago,

1055
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,477
how'd y'all meet?

1056
01:06:55,479 --> 01:07:02,350
Oh we, his internship, he...
at my parents vineyard.

1057
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,618
Well we know that.

1058
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:10,525
Yup, you do.
We, that's, yeah my dad...

1059
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,161
really liked him
and sort of adopted him.

1060
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:17,599
And... so he was
just around a lot and...

1061
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,468
we just, you know,
kind of kept crossing...

1062
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,806
-Paths?
-Paths, yup,

1063
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:26,441
and I still remember
the first time I...

1064
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,510
Oh when are y'all
just gonna get married?

1065

1066
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:34,349
You know, my son
got married four years back.

1067
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:36,351
Now I got two grandbabies.

1068

Kool-aid doesn't have
dynamic essentials

No wonder
you're only second tier.

1083
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:27,869

1084

By then,
I was already peach diamond.

1085
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,374
Well, could be that working
with dementia patients

1086
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:36,411

pyramid scheme at the moment.

1087
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:40,682
maybe they could use some
dynamic essentials too.

I know,
I shouldn't have done that.

1218
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:43,804
Done?

1219
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,640
Lied about the labels.

1220
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,643
(Lauren) <i>Oh, don't,</i>
<i>it's OK, don't worry.</i>

1221
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:52,713
No, I should've said something.
I'm really sorry.

1222
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:57,752
No, I really, don't worry.
Really, really, it's...

1223
01:15:57,754 --> 01:15:59,854
But Carrie said you were upset

1224
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:01,956
and then you guys had
this intense conversation.

1225
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,959
-So, are you?
-Yeah, I mean, yeah,

1226
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,794
I'm angry Justin!

1227
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,729
Like what was that, honestly?

1228
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:11,165
Justin, was that some kind
of like, pity assignment?

1229
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:14,835
I thought it would give you
something to take your mind off,

1230
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:18,005
I don't know, and then it
turned into a big lie, and...

1231
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:19,040
<i>Yeah, it's fine.</i>

1232
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:22,743
that Carrie had
nothing to do with it.

1233
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:25,646
She tried to tell me and look,
look, her dad uses

1234
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:27,081
-Got it, got it.
-No, her dad uses the same guy

1235
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,184
-maybe we can talk to him, yeah?
-Yeah, maybe.

1236
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:33,054
And I'm, I'm sorry
that Carrie had to tell you,

1237
01:16:33,056 --> 01:16:38,125
Fine! just, it's fine,
let's move on.

1238
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:40,127
No, I don't want
you to be upset.

1239
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,063
Justin, it was
my fault too, OK?

1240
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:45,132
I should've... I should've
told you that I knew, so...

1241
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,668
But, but, Carrie just told you.

1242
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,673
OK, what's going on?

1243
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:56,644
<i>Carrie. Carrie please. Baby.</i>
<i>[crying]</i>

1244
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:58,713
I'm so sorry.

1245
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,683
<i>What happened?</i>

1246
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,053
It wasn't a planned thing.

1247
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,160
No.

1248
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,198
-No, no, no.
(Carrie) <i>Please forgive me.</i>

1249
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:21,035
There's no way,
there's no way.

1250
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:22,970
Are you kidding?

1251
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,672
(Carrie) <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1252
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:26,741
(Justin) <i>No!</i>

1253
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,010
That's my little sister!

1254
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:35,116
Oh, you better believe
it's not going to happen again.

1255
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:38,119
I mean, how did it even get to
this point? I was tw days!

1256
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:41,088
-A lot happened.
-Are you kidding me?

1257
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:41,989
I don't get it.

1258
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,091
I, I can't. Oh my God.

1259
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,827
-Justin!
-No.

1260
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,729
-I'm gonna talk to him.
-No, hey let me talk to him.

1261
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:51,666
Lauren, please.
It's between me and Justin...

1262
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,771
Lauren, what the fuck
were you thinking?

1263
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,139
Stop it. I wasn't!

1264
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:01,442
Too bad Nicole's not around,
I could even the score.

1265
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:04,211
You don't say shit
about her, you hear me?

1266
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:06,881
You were happy to be off
making your big important deals.

1267
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:08,049
You were too busy for us.

1268
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:11,719
Yes, I was busy.
I told you I'd be busy.

1269
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:13,954
I am sorry your
girlfriend's dead.

1270
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,289
Doesn't mean you get mine.

1271
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,225
Got it, Justin.
You're very important.

1272
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,094
I'm just gonna try
to stay out of your way.

1273
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:22,163
No! You do not get
to twist this around.

1274
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,465
You think I like
kissing ass all day?

1275
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:27,835
Fuck you!
People make sacrifices!

1276
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,237
Justin, you apologize
right this second.

1277
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,972
Mom, go back to bed.

1278
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:35,076
No sir, no siree bob,
I'll do nothing of the kind.

1279
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:38,112
You apologize your sister
right this minute.

1280
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:40,948
OK I'm sorry,

1281
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:44,985
just so sorry, that you
slept with my girlfriend!

1282
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:46,153
(Carrie) <i>Justin!</i>

1283
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,056
OK we are not children,

1284
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,292
I think we should talk
about this like adults.

1285
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:55,329
-Please take the floor.
-OK.

1286
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,164
Something happened

1287
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,134
and Lauren hasn't
really been in,

1288
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:04,171
(Justin) <i>To fuck her?</i>
<i>-Feel sorry for me? No.</i>

1289
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:06,107
That's not what happened

1290
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:08,109
-That is not what happened.
-Lauren is this true?

1291
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:10,778
Two days! How?

1292
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:13,814
I mean it was only
two days, right?

1293
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:17,351
(Justin) <i>Do you need a shrink?</i>
<i>I'm finding you a shrink.</i>

1294
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:19,253
-Justin!
-No, google's great for this,

1295
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,888
I'm worried, Carrie thinks
you need someone.

1296
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,189
-Justin!
-We are not children!

1297
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:24,959
-Stop it!
-Let go! Justin!

1298
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,961
Ow, God!

1299
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,930
-Why are you taking her side?
-I'm not.

1300
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:34,101
Whatever, I'm done.
You can have her.

1301
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,338
Please, I want you,
please let's go back to Napa,

1302
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:41,308
Did you do this thing?
Lauren, did you?

1303
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,043
Lauren just needed somebody,
to be there for her

1304
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:44,845
-Stop! I don't...
-Oh my God, its such bullshit,

1305
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:47,915
-I'm going Justin.
-Go, you're so fucked.

1306
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,183
-Language.
-You're fucked!

1307
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:50,184
-You are!
-You are!

1308
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:51,886
-You are!
-You're fucked!

1309
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:56,257
Stop it, that's enough,
out of both of you.

1310
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:59,059
This is the last straw.

1311
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,997
I have, I have been forgiving,
and I tolerated that...

1312
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:04,365
thing with that
friend of yours.

1313
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:06,901
Mom, nobody really
likes being tolerated.

1314
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:08,369
Great, now I'm defending you.

1315
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:14,275
(Crystal) <i>This is my home.</i>
<i>You did this thing in my home?</i>

1316
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:16,944
I tried to help you.
I gave you a place to stay,

1317
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:19,346
I tried to get you work,
I made you meals.

1318
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,183
Yeah, you're great.

1319
01:20:22,185 --> 01:20:24,118
Who would guess
that you're a bigot?

1320
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,099
[knocking]

1321
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:44,038
Hey, is it cool if I chill
with you for a little bit?

1322
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,373
-Yeah, sure, sure.
-Thank you.

1323
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,209
-Everything OK?
-Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1324
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:51,111
I just uh... is it OK
if I chill here with you?

1325
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:56,083
-Can I get you anything?
-Oh my God, it's late.

1326
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,985
-Yeah.
-Were you asleep?

1327
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,286
-No, not yet.
-Oh, good.

1328
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,990
Um, oh, no, no
I'm good, thank you.

1329
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:05,359
OK. Just make
yourself at home.

1330
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,061
Thank you.

1331
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:11,432
I've never seen
your place before.

1332
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:14,635
-This is, looks really good.
-Thank you.

1333
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:16,003
Is that your Dad's?

1334
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:18,005
Yes, yeah.

[crying]

1336
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,313
I've just missed you.

1337
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,153
-You OK?
-Yeah...

1338
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,156
What are you?

1339
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:37,391
-It's OK, Kenny, it's OK.
-Are you drunk?

1340
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,226
What are you doing? Lauren!

1341
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:43,898
Hey, um.

1342
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,165
[sighs]

1343
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:47,968
-I'm gonna go.
-No, hey, you don't have to...

1344
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,137
-No, I'm fine. I'm fine Kenny.
-No, you're obviously...

1345
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:53,340
You keep acting
like nothing happened.

1346
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:54,508
It's fucked up.

1347
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,912
What do you want, me to cry
for the rest of my life?

1348
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:02,483
No, you don't get to tell me
how to handle this. No!

1349
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:05,319
I was there,
I was there for all of it,

1350
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,688
I was there to remind her
what her catheter was,

1351
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:10,224
every time she
tried to take it out

1352
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,393
and I was there
to rock her when it hurt,

1353
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:14,361
because she would do it anyway!

1354
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:17,398
I was there to shave her legs
in the bathroom sink

1355
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,100
when she still cared
what the nurses thought.

1356
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,969
And I was there to feed her,

1357
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:24,138
when she didn't care
about anyone else.

1358
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,472
At all. OK?

1359
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:29,276
I am not fucked.
I am not fucked!

1360
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,512
[vespa engine revs]

1361
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,082
Lauren!

1362
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,021
(Justin) How do we go forward?

1363
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,225
Please, please,
don't make the mistake of

1364
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:47,461
it was just a one time thing.

1365
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:52,099
I'll call your dad,
I'll let him know.

1366
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:55,002
You always do this.
You jump to a solution.

1367
01:22:55,004 --> 01:22:57,338
Isn't that one of
the off-limit words

1368
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,306
in your
communications rulebook?

1369
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:03,277
Effective communication
makes for a strong team, Justin.

1370
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:05,179
This is a strong team?

1371
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:07,047
Yes, are you kidding me?

1372
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,318
Babe, we convinced
four Napa bred investors

1373
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,989
to buy into a vineyard
in Oklahoma.

1374
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:18,058
-I mean, Oklahoma.
-Go us.

1375
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,027
-That's not...
-And fuck you,

1376
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:22,262
I'm so glad to hear
my dream of local wine

1377
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:26,066
is so preposterous to you.
Not surprised.

1378
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:29,336
You made it very clear
how much you hate it here.

1379
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,171
Why don't you just decide
