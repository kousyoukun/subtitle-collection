1
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,870
Where are my golf balls?

2
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
Anyone seen my sun block?

3
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,470
What's the point of going to Florida
if you use sun block?

4
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,410
I don't care, I'm getting toasted.

5
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,440
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a darker shade of skin.

6
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,010
He's jealous because he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

7
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,210
Hey, hey, easy on the fluids!
The rubber sheets are packed.

8
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,780
She wants "Ding. "

9
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,480
Behind "Ding" is 200 points!

10
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,820
All right!

11
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,690
That gives you 4700 points.

12
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,020
200 points! All right!

13
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,020
Honey, are you packed yet?

14
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,590
Yes.

15
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,190
Yes.

16
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,460
Everything I put out for you?

17
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,930
Yes.

18
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,890
Yes.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,990
Oh, did you see what Grandma sent you?

20
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,500
Let me guess. Donald Duck唐老鸭 slippers拖鞋?

21
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,660
Close.

22
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,000
Inflatable clown to play with in the pool.

23
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,130
How exciting.

24
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,900
Why Florida? There's no Christmas trees in Florida.

25
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,970
What is it with Christmas trees?

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,200
How can you have Christmas without a Christmas tree?

27
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,100
We'll find a nice fake silver one.
Or decorate a palm tree.

28
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,740
Guests of Ding, Dang, Dong
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel

29
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,640
New York's most exciting hotel experience.

30
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,910
For reservations, call toll-free,免费电话 
1- 800-759,..

31
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:09,780
- Where's the camcorder摄像机 battery电池?
 I put it in the charger充电器.

32
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,090
How's this?

33
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,250
Oh, much better.

34
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,150
Kevin, put your tie on. We'll be
late for the Christmas pageant.

35
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,390
It's in the bathroom. I can't go in.
Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

36
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,390
He says if I walk in there and see him
naked, I'd never feel like a real man.

37
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,060
Whatever that means他说些什么.

38
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,460
I'm sure he was kidding.
Just run in and get your tie...

39
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,930
...get out, and don't look at anything.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,470
Well

41
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,370
This cat they're talking about I wonder who could it be

42
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,430
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat

43
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,840
The heaviest cat you ever did see

44
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,740
When they see me walking down the street

45
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,740
None of the fellas want to speak Hey, hey, hey

46
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,070
On their faces they wear a silly smirk 'Cause they know

47
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,010
I'm the king Of the cool jerks

48
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,210
Get out of here, you pervert, or I'll slap you silly!

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.

50
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,880
Christmas tree, My Christmas tree

51
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
Lit up like a star

52
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,050
When I see my Christmas tree

53
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,990
Can loved ones be far

54
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,120
Christmas tree I'm certain

55
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,660
Wherever I roam

56
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,930
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Leslie.

57
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,460
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Frank.

58
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,730
Okay. Frank.

59
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,460
Frank!

60
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,370
Christmastime means laughter

61
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,870
Toboggans in the snow

62
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,230
Caroling together

63
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,970
With faces aglow

64
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,540
Stockings on the mantel

65
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,970
A wreath on the door

66
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,810
And my merriest Christmas

67
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,540
Needs just one thing more

68
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,040
Christmas tree

69
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,680
My Christmas tree

70
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,180
Kevin!

71
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,120
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

72
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,890
...I'd like to apologize for whatever displeasure...

73
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,190
...I might have caused you. - What?

74
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,730
My prank was immature and ill-timed.

75
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,330
Immature or not, it was pretty darn hilarious.

76
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I also apologize to my brother.

77
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,600
Kevin.

78
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,770
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
Oh, Buzz...

80
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,730
...that was very nice.

81
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,510
Kevin, do you have something to say?

82
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,210
Beat that, you trout-sniffer.

83
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm not sorry. I did it because Buzz humiliated me.

84
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,420
He gets away with everything, so I got him.

85
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,790
Since you stupidly believe his lies...

86
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,950
...I don't care if your Florida trip is wrecked.

87
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,190
Who wants to spend Christmas in a tropical climate?

88
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,160
Kevin!

89
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,660
You walk out, you sleep on the 3rd floor.

90
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,630
Yeah, with me.

91
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,020
So, what else is new?

92
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,890
Don't wreck my trip. Your dad's paying good money for it.

93
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,360
Wouldn't want to spoil your fun, Mr. Cheapskate.

94
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,760
What a troubled young man.

95
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,630
They're all a bunch of jerks.

96
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,100
Hi.

97
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,670
Last time we tried to take a trip,  
we had a problem just like this.

98
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,870
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.
  
99
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,340
I don't care for your choice of words. 
That's not what happened.

100
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,740
Buzz apologized to you.

101
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,210
Yeah, then he called me a trout-sniffer.

102
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,340
He didn't mean it. He was just sucking up to you.

103
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,710
Okay, why don't you just sit up here 
and think things over?

104
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,550
When you're ready to apologize to 
everyone, you can come down.

105
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,280
I'm not apologizing to Buzz. 
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat!

106
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,050
Then stay up here all night.

107
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,480
I don't want to go down anyway! 
I can't trust anybody in this family.

108
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,290
You know what? If I had my own money, 
I'd go on my own vacation.

109
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,120
Alone, without any of you. And I'd have 
the most fun of my whole life.

110
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,690
You got your wish last year. 
Maybe you will this year.

111
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,260
I hope so.

112
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,110
- We did it again! - We did it again!

113
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,480
Our McCallisters here, other McCallisters there.

114
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,690
I shouldn't complain, but you give 
the worst wake-up calls.

115
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,490
- Do you have the tickets? 
- I've got them. Here's your family's.

116
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,520
- How many do you have? 
- Seven.

117
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
- We have seven. 
- 14!

118
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,830
Seven...

119
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,860
...eight...

120
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,530
...nine, ten. 
- How come we're not sitting together?

121
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,790
This time of year, we're lucky to 
get on the same plane. 11, 12, 13,

122
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,930
Where's Kevin?


00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,630
14,

123
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,970
Good thing I have my own ticket, 
just in case you try to ditch me.

124
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,340
- Come on. - I need batteries.

125
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,840
I'll give them to you on the plane.

126
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,270
- Here's two more. 
- Why not now?

127
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,610
Not now! What's the gate number?

128
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
H-17,

129
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,640
Better hurry, it's the last gate. 
Dad, what gate is it?

130
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,810
H-17, Buzz. Come on, Kevin.

131
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,810
Kevin, you gonna take my bag? Take my bag.

132
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,910
Come on. Come on.

133
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,360
American Airlines flight 226 to New York...

134
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,260
...is now in the final boarding process.

135
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,630
Come on. Come on!

136
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,000
Dad, wait up!

137
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,500
Dad, wait up!

138
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,000
Wait up!

139
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,370
Wait!

140
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,610
Come on, come on!

141
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,570
Dad, wait!

142
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,610
Here we are! Here!

143
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,480
We made it.

144
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,010
Everybody here? We made it? All right.

145
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,450
Please board, the plane's leaving.

146
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,950
- I'll make sure everyone gets on. 
- We'll get everyone on.

147
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,950
Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight.

148
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
Bye. - Bye-bye.

149
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,890
Hey, wait up!

150
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,920
Hey, guys, wait for me!

151
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,690
- Cutting it kind of close. 
- Yes.

152
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

153
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,790
Wait!

154
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,760
Wait!

155
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,260
- I'm sorry. 
- That's okay. Are you on this flight?

156
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,090
Yeah. My family's on the plane. 
I don't want to be left here.

157
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,830
- Do you have a boarding pass? 
- Somewhere...

158
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,490
They're ready to go.

159
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,760
He dropped his pass.

160
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,530
This happened to me last year and almost wrecked my Christmas.

161
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,470
You sure your family's onboard?

162
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,840
My dad ran in right before I bumped into this lady.

163
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,500
Board him. Make sure he locates his family before you leave him.

164
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,170
Okay. Come on.

165
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,040
Do you see your family?

166
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,970
There's my dad.

167
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,770
- Find an empty seat. Merry Christmas. - You too.

168
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,210
In order to push back from the gate...

169
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,610
...all passengers must have their seat belts fastened.

170
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,890
So have you ever been to Florida?

171
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,600
Welcome aboard American Airlines 
flight 176 non-stop to New York.

172
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,440
I didn't think we'd make it.

173
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,170
Something wrong?

174
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,610
Honey?

175
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,680
I have that feeling.

176
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,610
We forgot something?

177
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,350
No, I don't think we did, but I just have that feeling.

178
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,910
Just bad memories.

179
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,810
We did everything, brought everything. We have everybody.

180
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,720
There's nothing to worry about.

181
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,420
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. We're fine.

182
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Nothing to worry about.

183
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,730
Mom?

184
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,660
Dad?

185
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,360
Uncle Frank?

186
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,070
Buzz?

187
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,540
We're the last ones off the plane.

188
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,470
Where are those guys?

189
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
Is this Megan's? It's Brooke's.

190
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,650
Give this to Brooke, this to Kevin.

191
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,850
- Give this... Give this to Kevin. - Give this to Kevin.

192
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,250
Give this to Kevin.

193
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,520
- Kevin. - Kevin.

194
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,850
- Give this to Kevin. - Give this to Kevin.

195
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
- Give this to Kevin. - Kevin.

196
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,950
- Give this to Kevin. - Here you go, Kevin.

197
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,550
- Kevin's not here. - Kevin's not here.

198
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,290
- Kevin's not here. - Kevin's not here.

199
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:53,230
- Kevin's not here. - Kevin's not here.

200
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,730
What!

201
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,000
Kevin!

202
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,310
Excuse me, this is an emergency!

203
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,080
Yes, sir?

204
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,580
What city is that?

205
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,140
That's New York.

206
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,110
Yikes, I did it again!

207
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,450
Something wrong, sir?

208
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,450
I'll be fine.

209
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,220
Oh, no. My family's in Florida and I'm in New York.

210
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,060
Wow.

211
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,970
What's the child's name?

212
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,900
- Kevin. - K-E-V-I-N.

213
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,140
When did you see him last?

214
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,340
Curbside check-in?

215
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,910
No, I saw him at the door. 
He was with us in the terminal.

216
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,710
Most people get separated at security. 
Did everyone get through security?

217
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
I don't know. Peter...

218
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,910
We were in a hurry. 
We ran all the way to the gate.

219
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,210
When did you notice he was missing?

220
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,780
When we picked up our baggage here.

221
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,620
- Has the boy ever run away from home? - No.

222
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,620
Has he ever been in a situation on his own?

223
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,490
As a matter of fact, this has happened before.

224
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,260
It's becoming a McCallister family travel tradition.

225
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,760
Funnily enough, we never lose our luggage.

226
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,960
He was left at home, by accident, last year.

227
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,830
That's what my wife meant calling it 
a McCallister family travel tradition.

228
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,230
We'll call Chicago and...

229
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,740
...notify them of the situation.

230
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,340
The odds are that's where he is.

231
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,910
Thanks.

232
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,540
Very unlikely he'd be anywhere else.

233
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,180
Watch out, kid!

234
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Yo, where's your manifest?

235
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,160
Here we are, Marv, New York City.

236
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,590
The land of opportunity.

237
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,090
Smell that?

238
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,390
Yeah.

239
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,030
Know what that is?

240
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,890
- Fish. - It's freedom.

241
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,890
No, it's fish.

242
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,160
- It's freedom and it's money. - Okay, okay.

243
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,260
It's freedom.

244
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,930
Come on, let's go before someone sees us.

245
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,800
And it's fish.

246
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,000
Yes, one quick score.

247
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,970
We get ourselves some phony passports...

248
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,070
...and we hightail it to some foreign country.

249
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,040
Arizona?

250
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:52,310
That's very smart, Marv.

251
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,580
You bust out of jail to rob 14 cents from a Santy Claus?

252
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Every bit helps.

253
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,150
Besides, now we got our new nickname.

254
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,950
We're the Sticky Bandits!

255
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,010
Real cute.

256
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,110
Very cute.

257
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,920
"The Plaza Hotel. New York's most exciting hotel experience. "

258
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,600
Sick!

259
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,920
What's the matter?

260
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,220
Thought I saw something.

261
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,430
Serves you right! Come on, let's go.

262
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,500
I think she likes me.

263
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,160
Ahh.

264
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,280
Excuse me, where's the lobby?

265
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,350
- Down the hall and to the left. - Thanks.

266
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,590
Wow.

267
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,360
Guests of the new Celebrity Ding-Dang-Dong...

268
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,290
...stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel:

269
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,930
New York's most exciting hotel experience.

270
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,990
For reservations, call toll-free...

271
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,230
...1-800-759-3000,

272
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,600
I'll do just that.

273
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,200
Howdy-do. This is Peter McCallister. The father.

274
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,070
I'd like a hotel room.

275
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,770
With an extra-large bed, a TV...

276
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,900
...and one of those little refrigerators with a key.

277
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Credit card? You got it.

278
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,510
Plaza Reservations, may I help you?

279
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,440
Howdy-do. This is Peter McCallister.

280
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,110
The father.

281
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,110
Yes, sir. - I'd like a hotel room.

282
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,610
Yes. - With an extra-large bed, a TV...

283
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,680
...and one of those little refrigerators with a key.

284
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,380
You'll need a major credit card.

285
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,380
Credit card? You got it.


286
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,350
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

287
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Yes, two at eight, Henri. Mr. Yamamoto.

288
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,790
Hold on a second.

289
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
I'll call you back.

290
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,290
Hi.

291
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,990
Can I help you?

292
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,060
Reservation for McCallister.

293
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,230
A reservation for yourself?

294
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,900
My feet are hardly touching the ground. 
I can barely see over the counter.

295
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,700
How can I make a reservation for a room?

296
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,970
Think about it: A kid going into a hotel making a reservation?

297
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,070
I don't think so.

298
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,270
I'm confused.

299
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,170
I'm traveling with my dad. He's on business. 
He's at a meeting.

300
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,640
I hate meetings. I'm not allowed to go in, 
only to sit in the lobby.

301
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,870
That's boring.

302
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,870
So my dad dropped me off.

303
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,440
Gave me his credit card and said to have check-in...

304
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,810
...let me in the room so I won't get into mischief.

305
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,510
Ma'am, sometimes I do get into mischief.

306
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,810
We all do.

307
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,080
Merry Christmas.

308
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,780
No sign of him.

309
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,880
We'll need to be in touch. You have hotel rooms?

310
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,450
- Yeah. - Do you have a recent photo of him?

311
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,450
I have one in my wallet.

312
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,350
I don't have my wallet.

313
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,490
My wallet's in my bag.

314
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,460
Kevin was looking in my bag at the airport. 
He has my wallet.

315
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,730
- Did you have credit cards? - Credit cards, money...

316
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,260
We'll notify the credit card companies.

317
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,190
If your son has the cards, 
we can get a location on him when he uses them.

318
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,230
I don't think he knows how to use a credit card.

319
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,300
Wow! It worked!

320
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,430
- Cedric. - Yes?

321
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,770
- Don't count your tips in public.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,300
And find out everything you can about that young fellow.

323
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,270
Front, please!

324
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,070
Enjoy your stay with us.

325
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Don't forget to remind your dad, when he arrives...

326
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,380
...he must come down and sign a couple of things.

327
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,780
- Thank you, you've been helpful. May I take your bag?

328
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,150
Up here to your left.

329
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,650
Herbert Hoover once stayed on this floor.

330
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,250
The vacuum guy?

331
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,680
No, the president.

332
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,390
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

333
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,190This is great!

334
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,130
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

335
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,730
Luxurious and spacious.

336
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,170
How convenient.

337
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,040
Hey.

338
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,040
Did you want the key in the bag? 
Or did you want to hang on to it?

339
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,710
I'll hang on to it.

340
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,740
Everything all right?


00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,210
- Is the temperature okay? - It's okay.


00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,380
- Do you know how the TV works? 
- I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.


00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,910
Well...


00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,780I'm sorry.


00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,890And there's plenty more where that came from.


00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,620Thank you.


00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,630Would you mind if I worked on my cannonballs?


00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,370No.


00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,100Thanks.


00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,170Yikes!


00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,950This is a vacation.


00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,450Hold it right there!


00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,820It's me, Johnny.


00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,550I knew it was you.


00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,560I could smell you getting off the elevator.


00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,690- Two scoops, sir? - Two? Make it three, I'm not driving.


00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,920Gardenias, Johnny, your favorite. - Thank you.



00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,590You was here last night too, wasn't you?


00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,730I was singing at the Blue Monkey last night.


00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,330She was not. She was smooching your brother.


00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,360You was here and you was smooching with my brother.


00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,200That's a dirty lie. - See?


00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,270Don't give me that. You been smooching everybody!


00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,070Snuffy, Al, Leo...



00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,740...Little Moe with the gimpy leg, Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...


00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,700I could go on forever, baby.


00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600You have me all wrong!


00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,840All right...


00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,340...I believe you.


00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,870But my Tommy gun don't!


00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,610Johnny!


00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,110You're the only duck in my pond!


00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,940Get down on your knees and tell me you love me.


00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,980Baby! I'm over the moon for you!


00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,010You gotta do better than that!


00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,810If my love was an ocean, Lindy'd have to take two planes to get across it.


00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,280Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you.


00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,050That's why I'm letting you go.


00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,520I'm gonna give you till the count of three, to get your lousy...


00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,920...lying...


00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,990...lowdown, four-flushing carcass out my door!


00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,090She's rat bait.


00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,290One!


00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,520Two!


00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,430Three!


00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,990Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.


00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,930And a Happy New Year.


00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,080Housekeeping.


00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,530We know a guy who can do the cool jerk


00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,000We know a guy who can do the cool jerk


00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,700This cat they're talkin ' about


00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,540I wonder who could it be


00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,700'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat


00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,800The heaviest cat you ever did see


00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,810When they see me Walkin ' down the street


00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,740None of the fellas want to speak Hey, hey, hey


00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,810On their faces they wear a silly smirk 'Cause they know


00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,370I'm the king of the cool jerks


00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,680Get out of here, you pervert, or I'll slap you silly!


00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,210Uh...


00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,150Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.


00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,920Oh, my foot!


00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,360Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.


00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,900Uncle Rob lives here.


00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,510If they're back from Paris, I'll drop in on them.


00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,380They usually give pretty good presents.


00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,230Good night, Mom.


00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,500Good night, Kevin.


00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,150Your drawers, sir.


00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,220Don't flash these babies around here! There could be girls on this floor!
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,090I was very careful, sir.
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,090You can't be too careful with underwear.
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,450I understand.
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,520I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,120That won't be necessary, sir. I still have some tip left over.
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,990No tip?
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,660Okay.
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,990No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,830The doorman will be happy to find you a taxi...
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,400Mr. McCallister.
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,130Excuse me.
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,530Sure.
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,730And how are we this morning?
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,100- Fine. Is my transportation here? - Out in front, sir.
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,770A limousine and a pizza.
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,640Compliments of the Plaza Hotel.
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,210I do hope your father understands that last night...
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,010...I was simply checking to see that everything was in order.
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,840Oh, he was pretty mad.
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140He was?
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,780He said he didn't come here to have his naked rear spied on.
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,050Of course not.
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,240Will he be down soon?
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,580He already left.
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,580I would've liked to have offered my personal apology.
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,150If a guy saw you in the shower, would you want to see him?
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,420I suppose not.
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,750I don't think you'll see him again.
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,750I understand.
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,620Bye.
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,990Have a lovely day.
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,390McCallister...
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,900- Good morning, Mr. McCallister. - Morning.
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,340Mr. McCallister, here's your very own...
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,170...cheese pizza.
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,320- Hello? - Hello.
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,950Know any good toy stores?
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,020Yes, sir.
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,860Ahh.
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,460Bingo!
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,870Get outta here! Go on, get outta here! Get outta here!
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,330Beat it! Beat it! Get outta here!
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,230Hey, Marv! Get over here! I gotta talk to you!
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,940Whoa, whoa!
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,910- Would you like a scarf? - Forget about that, we gotta talk.
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,580We don't have the equipment to pull off anything big: Banks, jewelry stores...
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:09,010We don't want goods. We need cash and we need it now.
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,510How about...
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,980...hotels?
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,950Tourists carry lots of cash.
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:19,050I got a better idea. Stores ain't depositing cash on Christmas Eve.
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,490The stores that will have cash are the ones dealing in moderate priced goods.
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,890Right. Right.
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,890Ergo, what store's gonna make the most cash on Christmas Eve...
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,920...that nobody's gonna rob?
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,890Candy stores.
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,190Nine-year-olds rob candy stores.
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,060This is what I had in mind:
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,060That's brilliant, Harry! Brilliant!
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,130Nobody's dumb enough to knock off a toy store on Christmas Eve.
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,200Oh, yes, there is.
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,770Here we are, sir: Duncan's Toy Chest.
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,040Merry Christmas, Kevin.
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,360This is the greatest accident of my life.
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,740Marv. Marv!
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000Hey, nice house. But there's no bathroom in it.
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,940So, what's the plan?
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,810Everyone leaves for a holiday off. We come out of our houses.
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,310Yeah, then what?
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,910We empty the registers and walk out.
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,110Great plan, Harry!
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,110Well, now, thank you and Merry Christmas.
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,380Say hello to the family.
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,750Let me see.
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,050You shopping alone?
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,520In New York? Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow.
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,120- I was just checking. - That's very responsible of you.
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,850Oh, well, thank you.
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,490My pleasure.
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,290That'll be $23,75,
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,520My, my, my. Where did you get all that money?
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,030- I have a lot of grandmothers. - Oh.
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,300Well, that explains it.
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,860This is a nice store. One of the finer toy dealerships I've visited.
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,060Well, thank you.
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,200Mr. Duncan must be a nice guy...
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,530...letting kids come in here and play with his toys.
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,700Most toy stores prohibit that.
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,070- Is that so? - Yes.
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,540Well, he loves kids.
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,940As a matter of fact, all the money the store takes in today...
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,340...Mr. Duncan is donating to the Children's Hospital.
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,670And the day after Christmas...
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,080...we empty out all the money in the cash register...
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:01,440...and Mr. Duncan takes it right down to the hospital.
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,110That's generous of him.
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,640Well, children bring him a lot of joy...
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,150...as they do to everyone who appreciates them.
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,850I'm not supposed to spend this, but I have $20 in a jar in our garage...
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,950...where my brother can't find it. So I can pay my mother back.
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:29,250So give this to Mr. Duncan. The hospital needs it more than I do.
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:34,030Besides, I'll probably spend it on stuff that will rot my teeth and mind.
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,190Ah, that's... That's very sweet of you.
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,130You see that tree there?
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,030Well, to show our appreciation for your generosity...
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,900...I'll let you select an object from that tree...
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,270...to take home with you. - For free?
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,400- May I make a suggestion? - Okay.
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,730Take the turtledoves.
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,640I can have two?
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,270Well, "two turtledoves. " And I tell you what you do.
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,110You keep one...
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:12,310...and give the other one to a very special person.
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,810You see, turtledoves...
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,270...are a symbol of friendship and love.
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,040Now, as long as each of you have your turtledove...
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,880...you'll be friends forever.
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,310Wow, I never knew that. I thought they were just part of a song.
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,280They are. And for that very special reason.
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,350Wow.
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,720Thanks.
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,220Merry Christmas.
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,420Merry Christmas to you too.
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,490Be sure to bundle up if you go outside. It's nippy.
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,820Oh. I'll do that.
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,540Well, where to?
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,840You promised you'd take me to the Central Park Zoo.
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,910Hey, look who it is.
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,240Come on, let's get him.
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,280Hi, pal.
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,990Come on.
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,900Hey!
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,600Hey, watch it, man!
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:42,270Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush. Two for $5, Two for $5,
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,140Four for 10,
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,770There he is!
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,440All right.
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,610- Thanks. - Merry Christmas, dude.
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,620Whoa!
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,490Oh...
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,320Yes!
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,060Thank you for your suggestion. My duty. My pleasure.
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,130Help! There's two guys after me!
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,200What's the matter? Store wouldn't take your...
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,830...stolen credit card?
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,700Let's see what the police have to say about this.
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,200Get up! Get up!
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,140Come on! Let's go get him.
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,940Get back here, you little thief!
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,940Stop that child!
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,040Grab him!
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,810Whoa!
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,720You little sh...
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,990I've committed credit card fraud.
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,150Get me security!
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,450We've got to stop that delinquent!
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,660Come along, Cedric!
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,200I've had enough of this vacation. I'm going home.
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,440Hold it!
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,440This is the Concierge, sir!
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,440I knew it was you.
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,770I could smell you getting off the elevator.
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,640You was here last night too, wasn't you?
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,980Yes, sir.
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,040I was.
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,910You was here and you was smooching with my brother.
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,520Bu...
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,350You're mistaken, sir.
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,920Don't give me that. You've smooched everybody.
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:01,620Snuffy, Al, Leo, Little Moe with the gimpy leg...
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,090...Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,020No!
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,290It's a lie!
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,860I could go on forever, baby.
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,030I'm terribly sorry, sir.
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,830I'm afraid you're mistaken.
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,200We're looking for a young man.
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,900All right, I believe you...
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,590...but my Tommy gun don't.
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,800Get down on your knees and tell me you love me.
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,470On your knees.
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,700I love you!
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,640You gotta do better than that!
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,380I love you!
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,840Maybe I'm off my hinges...
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,340...but I believe you.
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,010That's why I'm gonna let you go.
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,880I'm gonna give you till the count of three to get your lousy...
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,380...lying, low-down...
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,080...four-flushing carcass out my door!
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,380- One! - Open the door!
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,450Two!
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,520Three.
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,990Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,590And a happy new year.
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,900Stay in your rooms! This is an emergency!
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,930There's an insane guest with a gun!
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,770No!
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,010Come to Papa!
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,670Round trip to Miami. What's the matter, get on the wrong plane?
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,680You won't be needing this.
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:20,110American don't fly to the promised land, little buddy.
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:26,210We spent 9 months in jail thinking we had the worst luck in the universe.
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,880We were wrong.
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,610We busted out and we're doing fine. Even better...
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,320...because we're not robbing houses, we're robbing toy stores.
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,650At midnight tonight, we'll hit Duncan's Toy Chest.
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,590Five floors of cash.
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,390Then after that, we grab some phony passports and go to Rio.
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,450- You want to shut up? - He's not gonna talk to anybody.
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,690Except maybe a fish.
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,990Or the undertaker.
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,230Let's go to the subway tunnel. I'll feel better once I get him on ice.
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,590I've got a gun.
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,530Say anything and you'll be spitting gum out through your forehead.
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,140Well, hello.
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,140He did it!
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:32,940Did what?
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,240Thanks!
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,480Go get him. He went in the park.
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,550What are you doing flirting?!
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,430Over there!
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,960Don't! Give it!
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,160Hey, Harry.
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,030- I got him. - Let me see!
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,170That ain't him! Put him down. That ain't him.
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:42,200We should've shot him. I hate pulling a job, knowing that creep's loose.
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,900- What can he do? Kids are helpless. - Not this kid.
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,570But this time he doesn't have a house full of dangerous goodies.
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:54,570He's in the park. He's alone. Kids are scared of the park.
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,780Yeah. Grown men come in the park and don't leave alive.
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,880Good luck, little fella.
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,510I want to go home.
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,280Mom, where are you?
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,300Turn that down!
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,660- Hello? Kate McCallister.
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,470- This is she. - We found him.
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,200- Oh, my God! - What?
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,330- They know where Kevin is. - Where?
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,570- He's in New York City. - New York!
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,040New York?
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,740What?
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,540- He's scared, he's not a troublemaker. - What? What?
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:11,870Just a second. He used your credit card to check into the Plaza Hotel.
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,610- Do they have him? - Is he there?
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,070- No, they're still looking. - Damn it!
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,780- Get to New York. - We're on the next flight out.
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,310Thanks. We're going to New York, move it!
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:23,780Yes!
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,950He ran away when they asked about the card. He must be scared!
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:32,380- Would he go to my brother's? - Aren't they in Paris?
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:36,250- Maybe they have a housesitter. - Aren't they renovating?
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,730Hello?!
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,400Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:23,570Anybody home?!
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,470Hello!
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,640Anybody home?
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,640It's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin!
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,970Uncle Rob!
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,770Aunt Georgette!
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,330Watch it, kid!
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,060You looking for someone to read you a bedtime story?
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,500Taxi!
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,610It's scary out there.
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,670Ain't much better in here.
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,250I don't ever want to take a vacation like this again.
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,470Where did you come from?
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,540I don't have enough for everybody.
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,130How hungry are you guys?
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,840You guys ate all my food.
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,900I'm sorry I screamed in your face. You were trying to help me, right?
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,400I'm Kevin McCallister.
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:18,730Your birds are real nice.
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,430I've seen you before.
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,770You had pigeons all over you.
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,300At first, you look scary, but when I think about it, it's not so bad.
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,140They must like you to be all over you.
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:35,240If I'm bothering you, I can leave.
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:36,910Am I bothering you?
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,710No.
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,940Good. I'm not a pain in the butt?
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,510No.
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,910Will the pigeons come back on their own or do you call them?
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:06,490Give me your hand.
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,620They can hear it.
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,130This is great!
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,900It's pretty cold out.
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:40,800I'd sure like a cup of hot chocolate. How about you?
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,840My treat.
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,470I'd hate to spend Christmas Eve in such a park.
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:51,700Can we go someplace warm?
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,040Yes.
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,670I know a place.
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,530Nice music.
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,060This place is great.
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:50,260I've heard the world's great music from here.
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,330Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie.
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,300Frank Sinatra.
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,770Luciano Pavarotti.
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,700Do you bring your friends here?
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,470I haven't got many friends.
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:11,840Sorry.
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:14,710I'm like the birds I care for.
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:19,780People pass me in the street. They see me but they try to ignore me.
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,110They prefer I wasn't in their city.
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,610Yeah. It's like that with my family. I'm like the pigeon of the house...
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,310...just because I'm the youngest.
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,310Everyone fights for position.
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,320Everyone wants to be seen...
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,580...and heard.
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,180I guess so.
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:41,950I'm seen and heard pretty much. But I get sent to my room a lot too.
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,020I wasn't always like this.
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,660What were you like before?
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,920I had a job. I had a home.
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,760- I had a family. - Any kids?
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:58,460No.
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,030I wanted them.
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:05,160But the man I loved fell out of love with me.
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,300That broke my heart.
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:10,760When the chance to be loved came along again...
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,700...I ran away from it.
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,170I stopped trusting people.
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,530No offense, but that seems like sort of a dumb thing to do.
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:23,700I was afraid of getting my heart broken again.
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,800Sometimes you can trust a person...
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,770...and then, when things are down, they forget about you.
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,510Maybe they're just too busy.
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,480Maybe they don't forget about you, but they forget to remember you.
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,640People don't mean to forget.
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,580My grandfather says...
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:46,080...if my head wasn't screwed on, I'd leave it on the school bus.
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:50,310I'm just afraid if I do trust someone, I'll get my heart broken.
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,850I understand.
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,650I had a nice pair of Rollerblades.
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,120I was afraid to wreck them...
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,080...so I kept them in a box. Do you know what happened?
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:06,190I outgrew them. I never wore them outside. Only in my room a few times.
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:11,290A person's heart and feelings are very different than skates.
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,190They're kind of the same thing.
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,490If you won't use your heart, who cares if it gets broken?
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:21,730If you just keep it to yourself, maybe it'll be like my Rollerblades.
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:25,430When you do decide to try it, it won't be any good.
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,430You should take a chance. Got nothing to lose.
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,830Little truth in there somewhere.
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,500I think so. Your heart might still be broken, but it isn't gone.
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:39,030If it was gone, you wouldn't be so nice.
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,630Thank you.
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,770Do you know it's been...
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,840...a couple of years since I've talked to anybody?
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:52,100That's okay. You're good at it.
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,970You're not boring. You don't mumble or spit.
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,940You should do it more often.
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,470Just wear an outfit with no pigeon poop on it.
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,180I have been working very hard at keeping people away.
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,010I always think I'll have a lot of fun if I'm alone...
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,610...but when I'm alone, it's not fun.
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,820I don't care how much people bug me...
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,480...I'd rather be with someone than alone.
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,480So what are you doing alone on Christmas Eve?
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,450Did you get into trouble?
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,420Yeah.
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,090You did something wrong?
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:29,720A lot of things.
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:35,790Did you know that a good deed erases a bad deed?
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,790It's late. I don't know if I'll have enough time...
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:42,030...to do enough good deeds to erase all my bad ones.
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:45,660It's Christmas Eve. Good deeds count extra tonight.
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:48,590- They do? - Of course they do.
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:52,630Think of an important thing you can do for others...
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,300...and go do it.
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,700Just follow the star in your heart.
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,770Okay.
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:04,370It's getting pretty late. I'd better get going.
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,970If I don't see you, I hope everything turns out okay.
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,810Thank you.
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,070Tell the birds I said goodbye.
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,640I will.
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,050Merry Christmas.
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,510Merry Christmas.
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:35,180If you need somebody to trust, it can be me.
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,310I won't forget to remember you.
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,920Don't make promises you can't keep.
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,710All the money in the registers...
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:45,440...Mr. Duncan is gonna donate to the Children's Hospital.
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,710At midnight tonight, we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:54,910You can mess with a lot of things, but you can't mess with kids on Christmas.
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,470We'd like to offer you a complimentary suite.
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,680It's a penthouse with a view of the park.
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:26,410I think you'll find it satisfactory. It was recently vacated by a countess.
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,880What kind of hotel lets a child check in alone?
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,380The boy had a very convincing story.
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,880What kind of idiots work here?
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,650The finest in New York.
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,780When you learned the credit card...
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,990I made the discovery.
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:44,580Why did you let him leave?
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,590We confronted him and he ran!
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:48,820You scared him!
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:53,490It's Christmas Eve, and because of you, our child is lost in a huge city.
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,860Take our family and luggage up to the room.
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:01,160Yes, sir!
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,760Run along, Cedric.
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:06,630I'll go to the police station to make sure they're looking for Kevin.
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,630I want you to stay here.
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:11,030- I'm going to look for him. - What?
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:15,300With all due respect, your son is lost in one of the world's biggest cities.
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,430Could you stay out of this?
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,130As you wish.
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:25,440Thank you. It's not a good idea to run around New York City alone.
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,270If Kevin can, so can I.
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,600- Kate... - I'll be fine.
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,740The way I feel, no mugger or murderer would mess with me.
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:37,310There are hundreds of armed parasites out there!
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:42,110Do bundle up. It's awfully cold outside.
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:17,990Marv. Marv.
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,920Come on, let's go.
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:41,700Marv.
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:43,700Crowbars up!
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,570Merry Christmas, Harry!
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:58,210Happy Hanukkah, Marv!
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,750This is more money than I can even count!
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:15,180It makes you wonder why we spent so much time robbing homes.
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:31,720The amazing thing is, we're fugitives from the law...
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,960...we're up to our elbows in cash and nobody even knows about it.
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,930He's back!
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:44,590He took our picture!
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,130How was my hair?
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:55,830This is it. No turning back.
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,770Another Christmas in the trenches.
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,730No!
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,640Wow.
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:11,040That's it! Get the money! Get it!
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,410I'll kill him!
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,940- Marv! - I'm coming, Harry!
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:33,450Harry?
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,520Harry!
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,180That was incredible.
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:45,720- I twisted my ankle. - Where is he?
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:48,190Hey, guys! Smile!
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:52,120Come on! Come on!
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,290- Help me. - I got you.
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,090I got you.
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,870Taxi!
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:31,840Times Square!
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,050Where'd he go?
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,750I'm up here! Come get me!
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,480Let's kill!
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,380Hold on, pea-brain.
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:07,390We got busted because we underestimated that bundle of misery.
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,890This ain't like that.
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:13,590This ain't his house. The kid's running scared. He ain't got a plan.
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,760May I do the thinking, please?
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,090Thank you.
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,260Sonny!
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:23,860Yes?
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,830Nothing would thrill me more greatly than to shoot you.
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:31,460Knocking off a youngster won't mean that much to me.
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,060- Understand? - Mm-hm.
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,060But since we're in a hurry, I'll make a deal with you.
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:41,200You throw down your camera and we won't hurt you.
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:46,000You'll never hear from us again. Okay?
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,300Promise?
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:51,570I cross my heart and hope to die.
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,040Okay!
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,780Okay, kid...
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,780...give it to me.
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:12,080Direct hit!
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,280How many fingers am I holding up?
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:24,020Eight?
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:31,320Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks? Go ahead, throw another one.
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,420Don't do that!
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:40,460If you can't do any better than that, you're going to lose.
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:43,590Harry...
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,030...no.
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,400You got any more?
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,430Get up. He don't have any more bricks.
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,770What?
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,870What?
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,470What?
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:20,040That did it! Nobody throws bricks at me and gets away with it. Come on!
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,610You go this way. I'll go around back.
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,640Harry?
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,750Harry?
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,080Harry?
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:59,490Huh?
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:01,840Harry!
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:04,140I reached the top!
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,950Ahh.
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:58,770You better do better than this.
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:25,010Wow!
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,080What a hole!
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:49,390Whoa!
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,390Uh-oh.
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:36,840Ah!
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,350Harry.
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:58,820I'm coming up!
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,960Uh-oh.
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,830I'm gonna murder that kid!
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,070Yes!
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,340Whoa.
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:54,510Whoa, whoa!
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:06,220Hey!
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:09,350Don't you know a kid always wins against two idiots?
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:11,820Harry! In the living room!
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,990He went up the ladder!
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:31,630Oh.
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,330I'm coming, Harry.
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,030I'm coming.
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:42,430Harry!
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:48,300You didn't lose any teeth! Come on, he went to the second floor.
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,730Hey!
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:51,270Try the stairs.
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,610Right.
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,270Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,970Remember last year?
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:02,140No.
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:04,540Watch this.
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,840Let's get him!
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:11,810Ow!
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,180He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:16,580That's one.
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,910Don't worry, Harry.
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:21,920I'll get him.
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:27,650Ow!
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,790Right in the schnoz.
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:32,950That's two.
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,690Come on, let's get him.
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,620Oops.
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,830That's...
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:49,390...three.
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,330No.
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:00,530That's four.
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,500- Come on, Harry. - Marv, are you sure this is safe?
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:11,940I've worked all the kinks out.
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:13,670Solid as a rock.
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,950Like a rock, huh?
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:34,110Give up?
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:37,720Have you had enough pain? - Never!
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:51,750You better say every prayer you ever heard!
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:54,520I hope your parents got you a tombstone for Christmas.
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:58,660Where'd he go?
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:01,520I'm up here and I'm really scared.
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:13,200What's that sound?
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,640That was the sound of a tool chest...
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:38,370...falling down the stairs.
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:39,810Oh.
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:45,840Yes!
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:22,220Over there!
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:25,430Even if I get the chair, I'm killing that kid!
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,760Surrender, kid!
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,200He vanished.
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:33,230I'm here, you horse's ass!
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,130Whoa.
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,830Nice night for a neck injury!
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:44,270Suck brick, kid!
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,940Come on, Marv.
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,240I don't know.
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,410I said, come on!
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,210Come on, you big sissy.
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,810Harry? You wearing aftershave?
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,810That's kerosene.
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,910The rope is soaked in it.
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:23,680Why would anyone soak a rope in kerosene?
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:30,720Merry Christmas.
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:31,790Go up!
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:09,040Get off me!
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:33,750Get the bag!
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,580Two guys who robbed Duncan's Toy Chest are in the park.
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:42,680Central Park West, 95th Street. Look for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun.
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,150I'm here.
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:53,420Better come and get me before I call the cops.
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:02,030Whoa!
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:11,230My, how the tables have turned.
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:12,930How do you like the ice?
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:21,700Let's go for a little stroll in the park.
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,770Give me the bag.
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:41,570Give me it!
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,580Great for the album.
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:53,240You may've won the battle, dude, but you lost the war.
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:56,080You ought not of messed with us.
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:57,510We're dangerous.
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,650- Harry? - Shut up!
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:11,190Harry.
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,950Shut up! I want to enjoy this.
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:16,520Something's wrong.
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,220- Let's get out of here! - Shut up!
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:23,460I never made it to the 6th grade...
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:27,430...and it doesn't look like you're gonna either.
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:29,960Let him go!
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,630Kevin, run!
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,930Shoot her!
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,800Shoot her!
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:38,960- Shoot her! - I'm trying!
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:20,220Bye! Thanks.
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,530Jesus, looks like the 4th of July!
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,200We got the bridge. Take the tunnel.
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:53,830Let's go, let's go!
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:03,200Oh, my God!
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:15,240All right, let's go.
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,200Come on, on your feet.
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:26,710You guys should've started earlier. The prisoners already exchanged gifts.
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,540We missed the presents?
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:32,380He made us hide in the store and steal the kiddies' charity money.
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:34,510Shut up, Marv.
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:38,510You've got the right to remain silent.
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:41,850He's a little cranky. We just broke out of prison.
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,920Shut up, Marv!
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:46,750Get them out of here!
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:48,520If this makes the papers...
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:52,290...we're no longer the Wet Bandits, we're the Sticky Bandits.
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,550That's sticky. S...
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:57,090...T...
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:59,260I. I.
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:14,900It's all over. We apprehended the thieves and got your money.
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,530I want to get that money over to the Children's Hospital.
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:21,400I'll handle it. Thank you.
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:23,500Excuse me.
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:27,400I found this note. Looks like a kid broke your window.
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,400Dear Mr. Duncan:
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,470I broke your window to catch the bad guys.
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:34,170Do you have insurance?
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,910If not, I'll send you some money, if I ever get home.
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,110Merry Christmas. Kevin McCallister.
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:43,140P. S. Thanks for the turtledoves.
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:46,010Turtledoves.
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,340Oh.
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,350Excuse me. I'm looking for my son. This boy here.
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:05,120Please help me. This boy right here. Have you seen him?
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:17,690I'm looking for my son. He's been missing for two days.
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:20,790- Have you filed a report? - Of course we have.
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,360Then trust us. We'll handle it.
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,360Oh.
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,430I'm his mother.
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,830I know, but you're looking for a needle in a haystack.
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:38,400Do you have kids?
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,630Yes, ma'am.
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:42,630What if one was missing?
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:47,740I'd probably do the same thing you're doing.
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:50,130Thank you.
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:54,740Put yourself in his shoes.
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:57,100What would you do?
01:47:57,270 --> 01:48:00,710Me? I'd probably be lying dead in a gutter somewhere.
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:03,540But not Kevin.
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:07,410No. Kevin is so much stronger and braver than I am.
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:11,010I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is.
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:15,250But he's still alone in a big city.
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:17,950He doesn't deserve that.
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:22,650He deserves to be at home with his own family around his Christmas tree.
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,650Oh, dear God...
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:30,120...I know where he is.
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:33,420I need to get to Rockefeller Center.
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,960- Hop in. - Thank you.
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:44,390I know I don't deserve a Christmas even if I did do a good deed.
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,890I don't want any presents.
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:51,230Instead, I want to take back every mean thing I ever said to my family...
01:48:51,430 --> 01:48:53,700...even if they don't do the same.
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:58,130I don't care. I love all of them. Including Buzz.
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:02,530If I can't see all of them, could I just see my mother?
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:07,470I'll never want another thing, ever. I just want my mother.
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,500I know it won't be tonight...
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:13,870...but promise me I can see her again. Sometime. Anytime.
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:18,340Even if it's just once and only for a few minutes.
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,910I need to tell her I'm sorry.
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,710Kevin?
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,750Mom?
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:42,150That worked fast!
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:54,520Oh, Kevin.
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:57,790Mom, I'm sorry.
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:01,260I'm sorry too.
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,300Merry Christmas, Mom.
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:19,800Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:22,760Thank you.
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:24,560Let's go.
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:26,800How'd you know I was here?
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:29,840I know you and Christmas trees, and this is the biggest.
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,300Where's everyone else?
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:34,470At the hotel. They didn't like palm trees either.
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,990Holy smokes, it's morning!
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,690It's Christmas morning, man.
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:27,790Don't get your hopes up.
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:29,260Huh?
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:31,290I don't think Santa visits hotels.
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,900Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,590He goes everywhere.
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:39,130Wake up, it's Christmas!
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,100Mom! Dad! It's Christmas!
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,040Wow.
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,770Where'd it come from?
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,510Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,910- My gosh! - Peter!
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:12,550Are we in the right room?
01:52:18,110 --> 01:52:19,780Don't open any of mine.
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,920- Who's Mr. Duncan? - Duncan? I don't know.
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:24,710Everybody calm down.
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:27,180Calm down!
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,490All right. Now...
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:33,650...if Kevin hadn't screwed up in the first place, again...
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:36,990...we wouldn't be in this most perfect...
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:39,890...and huge hotel room with all this free stuff.
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:41,520So...
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:45,390...I think it only fair that Kevin get to open the first gift.
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,490Then I'll go and the rest of you and so on.
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,660Merry Christmas, Kev.
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:58,430Merry Christmas, Buzz.
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:02,100Merry Christmas, Kevin.
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,630All right! Merry Christmas!
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:08,900Enough gooey sh...
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:12,540Show of emotion. Everyone, let's dig in!
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:19,340Everybody, save the paper. We can use it next year. And the bows.
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:57,190Merry Christmas.
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:00,420Kevin!
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:02,230Merry Christmas!
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:04,420I got something for you.
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:13,960What's this?
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:17,330It's a turtledove. I have one. You have one.
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,330As long as we each have a turtledove, we'll be friends forever.
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:27,900Oh, Kevin.
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,170Thank you.
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,300I won't forget you. Trust me.
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:06,350The room service bill, sir.
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:10,050Merry Christmas.
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:12,920Uh, oh.
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,920Nice family.
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:19,290Really.
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:30,190Merry Christmas indeed.
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:35,460Kevin!
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:38,500      You spent $967 on room service?!
