1
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,394
Where are my golf balls?

2
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,149
Anyone seen my sun block?

3
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,945
What's the point of going to Florida
if you use sun block?

4
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,906
I don't care, I'm getting toasted.

5
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,952
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a darker shade of skin.

6
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,540
He's jealous because he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

7
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,752
Hey, hey, easy on the fluids!
The rubber sheets are packed.

8
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,295
She wants "Ding. "

9
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,006
Behind "Ding" is 200 points!

10
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,341
All right!

11
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,219
That gives you 4700 points.

12
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,555
200 points! All right!

13
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,560
Honey, are you packed yet?

14
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,144
Y es.

15
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,688
Yes.

16
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,983
Everything I put out?

17
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,443
Y es.

18
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,404
Yes.

19
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,115
Oh, did you see what Grandma sent you?

20
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,243
Let me guess. Donald Duck slippers?

21
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,203
Close.

22
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,373
Inflatable clown to play with
in the pool.

23
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,666
How exciting.

24
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,462
Why Florida? There's no
Christmas trees in Florida.

25
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,590
What is it with Christmas trees?

26
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,759
How can you have Christmas
without a Christmas tree?

27
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,680
We'll find a nice fake silver one.
Or decorate a palm tree.

28
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:50,230
Guests of Ding, Dang, Dong

29
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,983
New York 's most exciting
hotel experience.

30
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,862
For reservations, call toll-free,
1-800-759--

31
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:02,326
- Where's the camcorder battery?
- I put it in the charger.

32
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,672
How's this?

33
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,341
Oh, much better.

34
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,553
Kevin, put your tie on. We'll be
late for the Christmas pageant.

35
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,974
It's in the bathroom. I can't go in.
Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

36
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,979
He says if I walk in there and see him
naked, I'd never feel like a real man.

37
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,607
Whatever that means.

38
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,072
I'm sure he was kidding.
Just run in and get your tie...

39
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,491
...get out, and don't look
at anything.

40
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,036
Well

41
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,958
This cat they're talking about
I wonder who, could it be

42
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,086
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat

43
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,422
The heaviest cat you ever did see

44
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,342
When they see me
Walkin ' down the street

45
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,345
None of the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey, hey

46
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,682
On their faces they wear a silly smirk
'Cause they know

47
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,644
I'm the king
Of the cool jerks

48
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,817
Get out of here, you pervert,
or I'll slap you silly!

49
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,489
Oh, you' re cooking, Frankie.

50
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,500
Christmas tree
My Christmas tree

51
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,337
Lit up like a star

52
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,674
When I see
My Christmas tree

53
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,636
Can loved ones be far

54
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,764
Christmas tree
I'm certain

55
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,310
Wherever I roam

56
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,521
Kevin's solo's coming up.
T ell Leslie.

57
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,065
Kevin's solo's coming up.
T ell Frank.

58
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,359
Okay. Frank.

59
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,069
Frank!

60
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,036
Christmastime means laughter

61
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,498
Toboggans in the snow

62
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,876
Caroling together

63
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,671
With faces aglow

64
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,175
Stockings on the mantel

65
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,637
A wreath on the door

66
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,432
And my merriest Christmas

67
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,228
Needs just one thing more

68
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,729
Christmas tree

69
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,315
My Christmas tree

70
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,833
Kevin!

71
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,843
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

72
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,601
...I'd like to apologize
for whatever displeasure...

73
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,895
- ... I might have caused you.
- What?

74
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,399
My prank was immature and ill-timed.

75
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,986
Immature or not, it was
pretty darn hilarious.

76
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,282
I also apologize to my brother.

77
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,285
Kevin.

78
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,452
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,706
Oh, Buzz...

80
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,416
...that was very nice.

81
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,215
Kevin, do you have something to say?

82
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,902
Beat that, you trout-sniffer.

83
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,327
I'm not sorry. I did it
because Buzz humiliated me.

84
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,121
He gets away with everything,
so I got him.

85
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,499
Since you stupidly
believe his lies...

86
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,668
...I don't care if your
Florida trip is wrecked.

87
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,922
Who wants to spend Christmas
in a tropical climate?

88
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:26,882
Kevin!

89
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,384
You walk out,
you sleep on the 3rd floor.

90
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,345
Yeah, with me.

91
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,764
So, what else is new?

92
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,643
Don't wreck my trip.
Your dad's paying good money for it.

93
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,104
Wouldn't want to spoil your fun,
Mr. Cheapskate.

94
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,445
What a troubled young man.

95
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,327
They're all a bunch of jerks.

96
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,829
Hi.

97
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:04,419
Last time we tried to take a trip,
we had a problem just like this.

98
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,630
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.

99
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,093
I don't care for your choice of words.
That's not what happened.

100
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,470
Buzz apologized to you.

101
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,014
Yeah, then he called me
a trout-sniffer.

102
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,059
He didn't mean it.
He was just sucking up to you.

103
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:23,397
Okay, why don't you just sit up here
and think things over?

104
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,276
When you're ready to apologize
to everyone, you can come down.

105
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,988
I'm not apologizing to Buzz.
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat!

106
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,782
Then stay up here all night.

107
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,078
I don't want to go down anyway!
I can't trust anybody in this family.

108
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:42,040
You know what? If I had my own
money, I'd go on my own vacation.

109
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:46,879
Alone, without any of you. And l'd
have the most fun of my whole life.

110
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,465
You got your wish last year.
Maybe you will this year.

111
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,050
I hope so.

112
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,935
- We did it again!
- We did it again!

113
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,281
Our McCallisters here,
other McCallisters there.

114
00:10:56,532 --> 00:11:00,494
I shouldn't complain, but
you give the worst wake-up calls.

115
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,289
- Do you have the tickets?
- I've got them. Here's your family's.

116
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,333
- How many do you have?
- Seven.

117
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,585
- We have seven.
- 14!

118
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,590
Seven...

119
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,675
...eight...

120
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:18,303
- ...nine, ten.
- How come we're not sitting together?

121
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:22,641
This time of year, we're lucky to get
on the same plane. 11, 12, 13.

122
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,770
Where's Kevin?

123
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,439
14.

124
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,777
Good thing I have my own ticket,
just in case you try to ditch me.

125
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,165
- Come on.
- I need batteries.

126
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,667
I'll give them to you on the plane.

127
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,128
- Here's two more.
- Why not now?

128
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,464
Not now! What's the gate number?

129
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:55,716
H-17.

130
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,512
- Better hurry, it's the last gate.
- Dad, what gate is it?

131
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,681
H-17, Buzz. Come on, Kevin.

132
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,726
Kevin, you gonna take my bag?
Take my bag.

133
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,811
Come on. Come on.

134
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,216
American Airlines
flight 226 to New York...

135
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,135
...is now in the final
boarding process.

136
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,516
Come on. Come on!

137
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,894
Dad, wait up!

138
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,359
Dad, wait up!

139
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,861
Wait up!

140
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,197
Wait!

141
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,492
Come on, come on!

142
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,374
Dad, wait!

143
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,464
Here we are! Here!

144
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,386
We made it.

145
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,930
Everybody here? We made it?
All right.

146
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,349
Please board, the plane's leaving.

147
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,853
- I'll make sure everyone gets on.
- We'll get everyone on.

148
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,814
Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight.

149
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,607
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

150
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,736
Hey, wait up!

151
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,864
Hey, guys, wait for me!

152
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,576
- Cutting it kind of close.
- Yes.

153
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,619
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

154
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,704
Wait!

155
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,665
Wait!

156
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,170
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Are you on this flight?

157
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,007
Yeah. My family's on the plane.
I don't want to be left here.

158
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,759
- Do you have a boarding pass?
- Somewhere...

159
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,386
They're ready to go.

160
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,679
He dropped his pass.

161
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,474
This happened to me last year
and almost wrecked my Christmas.

162
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,393
You sure your family's onboard?

163
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,730
My dad ran in right before
I bumped into this lady.

164
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,401
Board him. Make sure he locates
his family before you leave him.

165
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,069
Okay. Come on.

166
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,908
Do you see your family?

167
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,910
There's my dad.

168
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,705
- Find an empty seat. Merry Christmas.
- You too.

169
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,124
In order to push back from the gate...

170
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,544
...all passengers must have
their seat belts fastened.

171
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,825
So have you ever been to Florida?

172
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:37,563
Welcome aboard American Airlines
flight 176 non-stop to New York.

173
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,409
I didn't think we'd make it.

174
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,164
Something wrong?

175
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,582
Honey?

176
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,667
I have that feeling.

177
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,587
We forgot something?

178
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:06,341
No, I don't think we did,
but I just have that feeling.

179
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,926
Just bad memories.

180
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,848
We did everything, brought everything.
We have everybody.

181
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,725
There's nothing to worry about.

182
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:21,398
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. We're fine.

183
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,901
Nothing to worry about.

184
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,755
Mom?

185
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,674
Dad?

186
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,385
Uncle Frank?

187
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,096
Buzz?

188
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,524
We' re the last ones off the plane.

189
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,489
Where are those guys?

190
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,163
- Is this Megan's?
- It's Brooke's.

191
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,667
Give this to Brooke, this to Kevin.

192
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,878
- Give this-- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

193
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,255
Give this to Kevin.

194
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,548
- Kevin.
- Kevin.

195
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,925
- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

196
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,135
- Give this to Kevin.
- Kevin.

197
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,013
- Give this to Kevin.
- Here you go, Kevin.

198
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,648
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

199
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,317
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

200
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,070
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

201
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,781
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

202
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,449
Kevin's not here.

203
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,285
Kevin's not here.

204
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,787
What!

205
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,001
Kevin!

206
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,364
Excuse me, this is an emergency!

207
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,159
Y es, sir?

208
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,660
What city is that?

209
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,206
That's New York.

210
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,209
Yikes, I did it again!

211
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,548
Something wrong, sir?

212
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,553
I'll be fine.

213
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:10,317
Oh, no. My family's in Florida
and I'm in New York.

214
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,821
My family's in Florida?

215
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,365
I'm in...

216
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,867
...New York?

217
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,189
Wow.

218
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,183
What's the child's name?

219
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:09,102
- Kevin.
- K-E-V-l-N.

220
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,271
When did you see him last?

221
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,523
Curbside check-in?

222
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:16,068
No, I saw him at the door.
He was with us in the terminal.

223
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:21,823
Most people get separated at security.
Did everyone get through security?

224
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,992
I don't know. Peter--

225
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,079
We were in a hurry.
We ran all the way to the gate.

226
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,374
When did you notice he was missing?

227
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,002
When we picked up our baggage here.

228
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,798
- Has the boy ever run away from home?
- No.

229
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,759
Has he ever been in a situation
on his own?

230
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,684
As a matter of fact,
this has happened before.

231
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,479
It's becoming a McCallister
family travel tradition.

232
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,942
Funnily enough,
we never lose our luggage.

233
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:12,166
He was left at home,
by accident, last year.

234
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:18,005
That's what my wife meant calling it
a McCallister family travel tradition.

235
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,466
We'll call Chicago and...

236
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,969
...notify them of the situation.

237
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,555
The odds are that's where he is.

238
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,140
Thanks.

239
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,768
Very unlikely he'd be anywhere else.

240
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:48,452
Watch out, kid!

241
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,091
Yo, where's your manifest?

242
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,390
Here we are, Marv, New York City.

243
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,851
The land of opportunity.

244
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,354
Smell that?

245
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:16,605
Yeah.

246
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,273
Know what that is?

247
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:21,109
- Fish.
- It's freedom.

248
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,111
No, it's fish.

249
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,406
- It's freedom and it's money.
- Okay, okay.

250
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:27,491
It's freedom.

251
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,160
Come on, let's go before
someone sees us.

252
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,037
And it's fish.

253
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,295
Yes, one quick score.

254
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:43,215
We get ourselves
some phony passports...

255
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,301
...and we hightail it
to some foreign country.

256
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,303
Arizona?

257
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,644
That's very smart, Marv.

258
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,814
You bust out of jail to rob 14 cents
from a Santy Claus?

259
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,315
Every bit helps.

260
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:03,402
Besides, now we got our new nickname.

261
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,238
We' re the Sticky Bandits!

262
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,323
Real cute.

263
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,409
Very cute.

264
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:31,221
"The Plaza Hotel. New Y ork's most
exciting hotel experience. "

265
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,861
Sick!

266
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,253
What's the matter?

267
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,547
Thought I saw something.

268
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,690
Serves you right! Come on, let's go.

269
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,775
I think she likes me.

270
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,486
Ahh.

271
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,564
Excuse me, where's the lobby?

272
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:48,692
- Down the hall and to the left.
- Thanks.

273
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,916
Wow.

274
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,760
Guests of
the new Celebrity Ding-Dang-Dong...

275
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,679
...stay at the world-renowned
Plaza Hotel:

276
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,307
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.

277
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,392
For reservations, call toll-free...

278
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:26,563
... 1-800-759-3000.

279
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,983
I'll do just that.

280
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,529
Howdy-do. This is Peter
McCallister. The father.

281
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,447
I'd like a hotel room.

282
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:38,158
With an extra-large bed, a TV...

283
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,286
...and one of those little
refrigerators with a key.

284
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,997
Credit card? You got it.

285
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,920
Plaza Reservations, may I help you?

286
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,798
Howdy-do. This is Peter McCallister.

287
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,508
The father.

288
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,510
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like a hotel room.

289
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,013
- Yes.
- With an extra-large bed, a TV...

290
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:04,101
...and one of those little
refrigerators with a key.

291
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,812
You'll need a major credit card.

292
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,731
Credit card? You got it.

293
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:12,734
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

294
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:19,116
Y es, two at eight, Henri.
Mr. Y amamoto.

295
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,201
Hold on a second.

296
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:27,332
I'll call you back.

297
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:31,712
Hi.

298
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,426
Can I help you?

299
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,511
Reservation for McCallister.

300
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,682
A reservation for yourself?

301
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,353
My feet are hardly touching the ground.
I can barely see over the counter.

302
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,106
How can I make a reservation
for a room?

303
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,402
Think about it: A kid going into
a hotel making a reservation?

304
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,487
I don't think so.

305
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:00,699
I'm confused.

306
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,620
I'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business. He's at a meeting.

307
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:09,082
I hate meetings. I'm not allowed
to go in, only to sit in the lobby.

308
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,334
That's boring.

309
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,336
So my dad dropped me off.

310
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,882
Gave me his credit card and said
to have check-in...

311
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,302
...Iet me in the room
so I won't get into mischief.

312
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,930
Ma'am, sometimes I do
get into mischief.

313
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,266
We all do.

314
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,521
Merry Christmas.

315
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,232
No sign of him.

316
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:37,319
We'll need to be in touch.
You have hotel rooms?

317
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:40,906
- Yeah.
- Do you have a recent photo of him?

318
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,910
I have one in my wallet.

319
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,830
I don't have my wallet.

320
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:50,958
My wallet's in my bag.

321
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,920
Kevin was looking in my bag at
the airport. He has my wallet.

322
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:58,257
- Did you have credit cards?
- Credit cards, money--

323
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,759
We'll notify the credit card
companies.

324
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:05,597
If your son has the cards, we can get
a location on him when he uses them.

325
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:08,725
I don't think he knows
how to use a credit card.

326
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:12,771
Wow! It worked!

327
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,902
- Cedric.
- Yes?

328
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,239
- Don't count your tips in public.
- I'm sorry.

329
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:26,827
And find out everything you can
about that young fellow.

330
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,746
Front, please!

331
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,587
Enjoy your stay with us.

332
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,756
Don't forget to remind
your dad, when he arrives...

333
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:42,885
...he must come down and
sign a couple of things.

334
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,346
- Thank you, you've been helpful.
- May I take your bag?

335
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,686
Up here to your left.

336
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,148
Herbert Hoover
once stayed on this floor.

337
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,733
The vacuum guy?

338
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,194
No, the president.

339
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,910
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

340
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,711
This is great!

341
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:26,678
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

342
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:36,230
Luxurious and spacious.

343
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,695
How convenient.

344
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,575
Hey.

345
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:54,623
Did you want the key in the bag?
Or did you want to hang on to it?

346
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,250
I'll hang on to it.

347
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,296
Everything all right?

348
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,841
- ls the temperature okay?
- It's okay.

349
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:07,928
- Do you know how the TV works?
- I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.

350
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,472
Well...

351
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,352
I'm sorry.

352
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,443
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

353
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:27,156
Thank you.

354
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:57,227
Would you mind if I worked
on my cannonballs?

355
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,979
No.

356
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:00,647
Thanks.

357
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,746
Yikes!

358
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:39,561
This is a vacation.

359
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,022
Hold it right there!

360
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,399
It's me, Johnny.

361
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,151
I knew it was you.

362
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,154
I could smell you getting off
the elevator.

363
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:54,284
- Two scoops, sir?
- Two? Make it three, l' m not driving.

364
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:58,539
- Gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.
- Thank you.

365
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:01,208
You was here last night too,
wasn't you?

366
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,336
I was singing at the Blue Monkey
last night.

367
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:06,964
She was not.
She was smooching your brother.

368
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:11,009
You was here and you was
smooching with my brother.

369
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:12,845
- That's a dirty lie.
- See?

370
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,931
Don't give me that.
You been smooching everybody!

371
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,725
Snuffy, Al, Leo...

372
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:23,355
...Little Moe with the gimpy leg,
Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...

373
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,357
I could go on forever, baby.

374
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,234
You have me all wrong!

375
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,443
All right...

376
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,945
...I believe you.

377
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,489
But my Tommy gun don't!

378
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,283
Johnny!

379
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,702
You're the only duck in my pond!

380
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,580
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

381
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:42,624
Baby! I'm over the moon for you!

382
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,668
You gotta do better than that!

383
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:50,465
If my love was an ocean, Lindy'd have
to take two planes to get across it.

384
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,928
Maybe I'm off my hinges,
but I believe you.

385
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,723
That's why I'm letting you go.

386
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,186
I'm gonna give you till the count
of three, to get your lousy...

387
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:03,604
...Iying...

388
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:07,608
...Iowdown, four-flushing carcass
out my door!

389
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,735
She's rat bait.

390
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:10,944
One!

391
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:13,155
Two!

392
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,040
Three!

393
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,668
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

394
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,631
And a Happy New Year.

395
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:04,706
Housekeeping.

396
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:50,252
We know a guy who can do the cool jerk

397
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:55,716
We know a guy who can do the cool jerk

398
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:59,428
This cat they're talkin ' about

399
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,264
I wonder who could it be

400
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,434
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat

401
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,604
The heaviest cat you ever did see

402
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:11,523
When they see me
Walkin ' down the street

403
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:14,443
None of the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey, hey

404
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,529
On their faces they wear a silly smirk
'Cause they know

405
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:22,117
I'm the king of the cool jerks

406
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:29,374
Get out of here, you pervert,
or I'll slap you silly!

407
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:30,959
Uh--

408
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,923
Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.

409
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,676
Oh, my foot!

410
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,128
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

411
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,647
Uncle Rob lives here.

412
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,234
If they' re back from Paris,
I'll drop in on them.

413
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,154
They usually give pretty
good presents.

414
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:41,048
Good night, Mom.

415
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,347
Good night, Kevin.

416
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:17,000
Your drawers, sir.

417
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:22,047
Don't flash these babies around here!
There could be girls on this floor!

418
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,966
I was very careful, sir.

419
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,927
You can't be too careful
with underwear.

420
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,303
I understand.

421
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,390
I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

422
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:36,019
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.

423
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:38,814
No tip?

424
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:40,482
Okay.

425
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,819
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

426
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,658
The doorman will be happy
to find you a taxi--

427
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:51,243
Mr. McCallister.

428
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:55,998
Excuse me.

429
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:57,374
Sure.

430
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,588
And how are we this morning?

431
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,966
- Fine. Is my transportation here?
- Out in front, sir.

432
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:08,635
A limousine and a pizza.

433
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,512
Compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

434
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,099
I do hope your father understands
that last night...

435
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,895
...I was simply checking to see
that everything was in order.

436
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,688
Oh, he was pretty mad.

437
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,981
He was?

438
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,651
He said he didn't come here
to have his naked rear spied on.

439
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:26,904
Of course not.

440
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,114
Will he be down soon?

441
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:30,532
He already left.

442
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:36,455
I would've liked to have offered
my personal apology.

443
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:40,042
If a guy saw you in the shower,
would you want to see him?

444
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,336
I suppose not.

445
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,630
I don't think you'll see him again.

446
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:46,632
I understand.

447
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:49,510
Bye.

448
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:53,889
Have a lovely day.

449
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,275
McCallister...

450
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,791
- Good morning, Mr. McCallister.
- Morning.

451
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:31,260
Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own...

452
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,095
...cheese pizza.

453
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:57,244
- Hello?
- Hello.

454
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,871
Know any good toy stores?

455
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,914
Yes, sir.

456
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:13,802
Ahh.

457
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:20,434
Bingo!

458
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,827
Get outta here! Go on, get
outta here! Get outta here!

459
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:41,288
Beat it! Beat it! Get outta here!

460
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:45,250
Hey, Marv! Get over here!
I gotta talk to you!

461
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:56,929
Whoa, whoa!

462
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:02,893
- Would you like a scarf?
- Forget about that, we gotta talk.

463
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:08,482
We don't have the equipment to pull off
anything big: Banks, jewelry stores...

464
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:13,028
We don't want goods.
We need cash and we need it now.

465
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,488
How about...

466
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:15,948
...hotels?

467
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,908
Tourists carry lots of cash.

468
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:23,038
I got a better idea. Stores ain't
depositing cash on Christmas Eve.

469
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:28,460
The stores that will have cash are the
ones dealing in moderate priced goods.

470
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,920
Right. Right.

471
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,882
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve...

472
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:35,926
...that nobody's gonna rob?

473
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:37,886
Candy stores.

474
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:41,181
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores.

475
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,059
This is what I had in mind:

476
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:49,022
That's brilliant, Harry! Brilliant!

477
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,112
Nobody's dumb enough to knock off
a toy store on Christmas Eve.

478
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,197
Oh, yes, there is.

479
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,886
Here we are, sir: Duncan's Toy Chest.

480
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:22,014
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

481
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:07,434
This is the greatest accident
of my life.

482
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:27,746
Marv. Marv!

483
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:31,041
Hey, nice house.
But there's no bathroom in it.

484
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:35,003
So, what's the plan?

485
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:39,883
Everyone leaves for a holiday off.
We come out of our houses.

486
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:44,388
Y eah, then what?

487
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:46,932
We empty the registers and walk out.

488
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,184
Great plan, Harry!

489
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,146
Well, now, thank you
and Merry Christmas.

490
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:55,440
Say hello to the family.

491
00:46:58,152 --> 00:46:59,820
Let me see.

492
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,115
You shopping alone?

493
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:06,577
In New York?
Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow.

494
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:10,247
- I was just checking.
- That's very responsible of you.

495
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,915
Oh, well, thank you.

496
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,625
My pleasure.

497
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:18,380
That'll be $23.75.

498
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:22,634
My, my, my.
Where did you get all that money?

499
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,139
- I have a lot of grandmothers.
- Oh.

500
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:29,433
Well, that explains it.

501
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,898
This is a nice store. One of the
finer toy dealerships I've visited.

502
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:37,149
Well, thank you.

503
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,318
Mr. Duncan must be a nice guy...

504
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:42,613
...Ietting kids come in here
and play with his toys.

505
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,781
Most toy stores prohibit that.

506
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,158
- ls that so?
- Yes.

507
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:48,660
Well, he loves kids.

508
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:53,040
As a matter of fact, all the money
the store takes in today...

509
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,460
...Mr. Duncan is donating
to the Children's Hospital.

510
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,795
And the day after Christmas...

511
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:02,174
...we empty out all the money
in the cash register...

512
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:05,552
...and Mr. Duncan takes it
right down to the hospital.

513
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:07,221
That's generous of him.

514
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:10,766
Well, children bring him
a lot of joy...

515
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:14,269
...as they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

516
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:24,947
I'm not supposed to spend this, but
I have $20 in a jar in our garage...

517
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:29,117
...where my brother can't find it.
So I can pay my mother back.

518
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:33,372
So give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.

519
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,168
Besides, I'll probably spend it on
stuff that will rot my teeth and mind.

520
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,299
Ah, that's--
That's very sweet of you.

521
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:47,261
You see that tree there?

522
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:51,181
Well, to show our appreciation
for your generosity...

523
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,101
...I'll let you select an object
from that tree...

524
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:57,437
- ...to take home with you.
- For free?

525
00:48:58,564 --> 00:49:01,525
- May I make a suggestion?
- Okay.

526
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,861
Take the turtledoves.

527
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:05,821
I can have two?

528
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:10,409
Well, "two turtledoves. "
And I tell you what you do.

529
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:12,244
You keep one...

530
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:16,456
...and give the other one
to a very special person.

531
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,917
You see, turtledoves...

532
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:22,462
...are a symbol of friendship
and love.

533
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:26,216
Now, as long as each of you
have your turtledove...

534
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,052
...you'll be friends forever.

535
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:33,473
Wow, I never knew that. I thought
they were just part of a song.

536
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:37,477
They are. And for that
very special reason.

537
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,480
Wow.

538
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:40,856
Thanks.

539
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:42,357
Merry Christmas.

540
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,568
Merry Christmas to you too.

541
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,654
Be sure to bundle up if you
go outside. It's nippy.

542
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,991
Oh. I'll do that.

543
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:29,613
Well, where to?

544
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,908
You promised you'd take me
to the Central Park Zoo.

545
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:44,002
Hey, look who it is.

546
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,341
Come on, let's get him.

547
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:56,390
Hi, pal.

548
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:17,161
Come on.

549
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:34,052
Hey!

550
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,767
Hey, watch it, man!

551
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:47,399
Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush.
Two for $5. Two for $5.

552
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:49,276
Four for 10.

553
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:50,903
There he is!

554
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,529
All right.

555
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:55,741
- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas, dude.

556
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:26,772
Whoa!

557
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:30,651
Oh...

558
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,487
Yes!

559
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:37,199
- Thank you for your suggestion.
- My duty. My pleasure.

560
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,296
Help! There's two guys after me!

561
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,384
What's the matter?
Store wouldn't take your...

562
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:58,011
...stolen credit card?

563
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:01,890
Let's see what the police
have to say about this.

564
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:09,356
Get up! Get up!

565
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:12,317
Come on! Let's go get him.

566
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:17,114
Get back here, you little thief!

567
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,118
Stop that child!

568
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:26,248
Grab him!

569
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,005
Whoa!

570
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:42,931
You little sh--

571
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:47,227
I've committed credit card fraud.

572
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:49,396
Get me security!

573
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:52,649
We've got to stop that delinquent!

574
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,861
Come along, Cedric!

575
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:17,424
I've had enough of this vacation.
I'm going home.

576
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:29,686
Hold it!

577
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,649
This is the Concierge, sir!

578
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,652
I knew it was you.

579
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:38,987
I could smell you
getting off the elevator.

580
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,867
You was here last night too,
wasn't you?

581
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,205
Y es, sir.

582
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,289
I was.

583
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:53,168
You was here and you was smooching
with my brother.

584
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:55,712
Bu--

585
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,590
You' re mistaken, sir.

586
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:02,177
Don't give me that.
You 've smooched everybody.

587
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:06,890
Snuffy, Al, Leo, Little Moe
with the gimpy leg...

588
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:09,351
... Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...

589
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:14,273
No!

590
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,526
It's a lie!

591
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:20,112
I could go on forever, baby.

592
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:23,240
I' m terribly sorry, sir.

593
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,117
I' m afraid you' re mistaken.

594
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:27,452
We' re looking for a young man.

595
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:30,164
All right, I believe you...

596
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:31,874
...but my Tommy gun don't.

597
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,086
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

598
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,757
On your knees.

599
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,019
I love you!

600
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,899
You gotta do better than that!

601
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,652
I love you!

602
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,114
Maybe I'm off my hinges...

603
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,616
...but I believe you.

604
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:08,285
That's why I'm gonna let you go.

605
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:13,165
I'm gonna give you till the count
of three to get your lousy...

606
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,667
...Iying, low-down...

607
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:18,337
... four-flushing carcass out my door!

608
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:21,673
- One!
- Open the door!

609
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:22,799
Two!

610
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:38,816
Three.

611
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:42,277
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

612
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:46,865
And a happy new year.

613
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:52,204
Stay in your rooms!
This is an emergency!

614
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:56,250
There's an insane guest with a gun!

615
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,095
No!

616
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,350
Come to Papa!

617
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,981
Round trip to Miami. What's the
matter, get on the wrong plane?

618
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:20,983
You won't be needing this.

619
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:25,445
American don't fly to the
promised land, little buddy.

620
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:31,535
We spent 9 months in jail thinking
we had the worst luck in the universe.

621
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,203
We were wrong.

622
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:36,957
We busted out and we're doing fine.
Even better...

623
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:40,627
...because we're not robbing houses,
we're robbing toy stores.

624
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:44,006
At midnight tonight,
we'll hit Duncan's Toy Chest.

625
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:45,924
Five floors of cash.

626
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:49,761
Then after that, we grab some
phony passports and go to Rio.

627
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:53,807
- You want to shut up?
- He's not gonna talk to anybody.

628
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:56,101
Except maybe a fish.

629
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,352
Or the undertaker.

630
00:57:57,603 --> 00:58:02,566
Let's go to the subway tunnel.
I'll feel better once I get him on ice.

631
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:05,944
I've got a gun.

632
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:09,865
Say anything and you'll be spitting
gum out through your forehead.

633
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:31,512
Well, hello.

634
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:36,517
He did it!

635
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:38,310
Did what?

636
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,606
Thanks!

637
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:47,861
- Go get him.
- He went in the park.

638
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:49,905
What are you doing flirting?!

639
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:26,817
Over there!

640
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:35,367
- Don't!
- Give it!

641
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:37,578
Hey, Harry.

642
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:39,454
- I got him.
- Let me see!

643
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:42,583
That ain't him! Put him down.
That ain't him.

644
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:47,629
We should've shot him. I hate pulling
a job, knowing that creep's loose.

645
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,341
- What can he do? Kids are helpless.
- Not this kid.

646
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:56,013
But this time he doesn't have a house
full of dangerous goodies.

647
00:59:56,221 --> 01:00:00,017
He's in the park. He's alone.
Kids are scared of the park.

648
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:04,188
Yeah. Grown men come in the park
and don't leave alive.

649
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:07,274
Good luck, little fella.

650
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,995
I want to go home.

651
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,706
Mom, where are you?

652
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:53,737
Turn that down!

653
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:57,115
- Hello?
- Kate McCallister.

654
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:58,909
- This is she.
- We found him.

655
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,619
- Oh, my God!
- What?

656
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:02,788
- They know where Kevin is.
- Where?

657
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:05,040
- He's in New York City.
- New Y ork!

658
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:06,500
New York?

659
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,211
What?

660
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,006
- He's scared, he's not a troublemaker.
- What? What?

661
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:17,344
Just a second. He used your credit
card to check into the Plaza Hotel.

662
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,055
- Do they have him?
- ls he there?

663
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,558
- No, they're still looking.
- Damn it!

664
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:25,310
- Get to New York.
- We' re on the next flight out.

665
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:27,771
Thanks.
We' re going to New Y ork, move it!

666
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,189
Y es!

667
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:34,444
He ran away when they asked about
the card. He must be scared!

668
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:37,865
- Would he go to my brother's?
- Aren't they in Paris?

669
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:41,743
- Maybe they have a housesitter.
- Aren't they renovating?

670
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:23,243
Hello?!

671
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:26,914
Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!

672
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:29,082
Anybody home?!

673
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,001
Hello!

674
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:33,170
Anybody home?

675
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,173
It's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin!

676
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,467
Uncle Rob!

677
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,302
Aunt Georgette!

678
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:25,848
Watch it, kid!

679
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:35,607
You looking for someone
to read you a bedtime story?

680
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:43,031
Taxi!

681
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:58,172
It's scary out there.

682
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:01,258
Ain't much better in here.

683
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,830
I don't ever want to take a vacation
like this again.

684
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:04,112
Where did you come from?

685
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:06,114
I don't have enough for everybody.

686
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,742
How hungry are you guys?

687
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:12,454
You guys ate all my food.

688
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:16,602
I'm sorry I screamed in your face.
You were trying to help me, right?

689
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:22,024
I'm Kevin McCallister.

690
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,359
Your birds are real nice.

691
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:27,070
I've seen you before.

692
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:29,406
You had pigeons all over you.

693
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:33,952
At first, you look scary, but when
I think about it, it's not so bad.

694
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:36,788
They must like you to be all over you.

695
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,918
If I'm bothering you, I can leave.

696
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,586
Am I bothering you?

697
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:45,380
No.

698
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:48,634
Good. I'm not a pain in the butt?

699
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:52,179
No.

700
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:59,603
Will the pigeons come back
on their own or do you call them?

701
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,157
Give me your hand.

702
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:18,288
They can hear it.

703
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:36,849
This is great!

704
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:42,563
It's pretty cold out.

705
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:46,483
I'd sure like a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you?

706
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:47,526
My treat.

707
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:55,159
I'd hate to spend Christmas Eve
in such a park.

708
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:57,369
Can we go someplace warm?

709
01:07:57,744 --> 01:07:58,704
Yes.

710
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:00,372
I know a place.

711
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:49,296
Nice music.

712
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:52,799
This place is great.

713
01:08:53,217 --> 01:08:56,011
I've heard the world's
great music from here.

714
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:00,098
Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie.

715
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:02,059
Frank Sinatra.

716
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:04,478
Luciano Pavarotti.

717
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,443
Do you bring your friends here?

718
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:15,197
I haven't got many friends.

719
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:17,574
Sorry.

720
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:20,494
I'm like the birds I care for.

721
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:25,541
People pass me in the street.
They see me but they try to ignore me.

722
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,876
They prefer I wasn't in their city.

723
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:33,298
Yeah. It's like that with my family.
I'm like the pigeon of the house...

724
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:35,092
...just because I'm the youngest.

725
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,095
Everyone fights for position.

726
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,139
Everyone wants to be seen...

727
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:41,348
...and heard.

728
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:42,975
I guess so.

729
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:47,688
I'm seen and heard pretty much.
But I get sent to my room a lot too.

730
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,776
I wasn't always like this.

731
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:55,404
What were you like before?

732
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,782
I had a job. I had a home.

733
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,535
- I had a family.
- Any kids?

734
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:04,246
No.

735
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:06,790
I wanted them.

736
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:10,961
But the man I loved
fell out of love with me.

737
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,088
That broke my heart.

738
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:16,550
When the chance
to be loved came along again...

739
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,469
...I ran away from it.

740
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:21,972
I stopped trusting people.

741
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:26,351
No offense, but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.

742
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:29,480
I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

743
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,524
Sometimes you can trust a person...

744
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:36,570
...and then, when things are down,
they forget about you.

745
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:39,281
Maybe they're just too busy.

746
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:43,285
Maybe they don't forget about you,
but they forget to remember you.

747
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:45,454
People don't mean to forget.

748
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,372
My grandfather says...

749
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:51,877
...if my head wasn't screwed on,
I'd leave it on the school bus.

750
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:56,131
I'm just afraid if I do trust someone,
I'll get my heart broken.

751
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,674
I understand.

752
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:00,469
I had a nice pair of Rollerblades.

753
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,013
I was afraid to wreck them...

754
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:06,934
...so I kept them in a box.
Do you know what happened?

755
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:11,980
I outgrew them. I never wore them
outside. Only in my room a few times.

756
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:17,110
A person's heart and feelings
are very different than skates.

757
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:19,988
They're kind of the same thing.

758
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,325
If you won't use your heart,
who cares if it gets broken?

759
01:11:23,909 --> 01:11:27,538
If you just keep it to yourself,
maybe it'll be like my Rollerblades.

760
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:31,250
When you do decide to try it,
it won't be any good.

761
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,253
You should take a chance.
Got nothing to lose.

762
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:37,673
Little truth in there somewhere.

763
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:42,344
I think so. Your heart might
still be broken, but it isn't gone.

764
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:44,888
If it was gone,
you wouldn't be so nice.

765
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:47,474
Thank you.

766
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:51,645
Do you know it's been...

767
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:55,649
...a couple of years
since I've talked to anybody?

768
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:57,943
That's okay. You're good at it.

769
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,863
You're not boring.
You don't mumble or spit.

770
01:12:01,113 --> 01:12:02,823
You should do it more often.

771
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:06,326
Just wear an outfit
with no pigeon poop on it.

772
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:13,041
I have been working very hard
at keeping people away.

773
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,878
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone...

774
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:18,505
...but when I'm alone, it's not fun.

775
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:21,633
I don't care how much people bug me...

776
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:24,344
...I'd rather be with someone
than alone.

777
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:28,348
So what are you doing alone
on Christmas Eve?

778
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,350
Did you get into trouble?

779
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:32,311
Yeah.

780
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:33,937
You did something wrong?

781
01:12:34,188 --> 01:12:35,564
A lot of things.

782
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:41,653
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

783
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:44,656
It's late. I don't know
if I'll have enough time...

784
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:47,910
...to do enough good deeds
to erase all my bad ones.

785
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:51,538
It's Christmas Eve.
Good deeds count extra tonight.

786
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:54,458
- They do?
- Of course they do.

787
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:58,504
Think of an important
thing you can do for others...

788
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,130
...and go do it.

789
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:03,550
Just follow the star in your heart.

790
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:06,720
Okay.

791
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:10,265
It's getting pretty late.
I'd better get going.

792
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:20,818
If I don't see you, I hope
everything turns out okay.

793
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:22,694
Thank you.

794
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,947
Tell the birds I said goodbye.

795
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,573
I will.

796
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:35,958
Merry Christmas.

797
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,417
Merry Christmas.

798
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:41,046
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

799
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:43,215
I won't forget to remember you.

800
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:46,802
Don't make promises you can't keep.

801
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:47,654
All the money in the registers...

802
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:51,366
...Mr. Duncan is gonna donate
to the Children 's Hospital.

803
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:55,662
At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan 's Toy Chest.

804
01:14:55,913 --> 01:15:00,876
You can mess with a lot of things, but
you can't mess with kids on Christmas.

805
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:24,520
We'd like to offer you
a complimentary suite.

806
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:27,689
It's a penthouse
with a view of the park.

807
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:32,486
I think you'll find it satisfactory.
It was recently vacated by a countess.

808
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:35,864
What kind of hotel lets a child
check in alone?

809
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:38,450
The boy had a very convincing story.

810
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,911
What kind of idiots work here?

811
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,705
The finest in New York.

812
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,834
When you learned the credit card--

813
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,044
I made the discovery.

814
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:50,629
Why did you let him leave?

815
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:53,632
We confronted him and he ran!

816
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:54,883
You scared him!

817
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:59,555
It's Christmas Eve, and because of you,
our child is lost in a huge city.

818
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,936
T ake our family and luggage
up to the room.

819
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:07,229
Y es, sir!

820
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:08,814
Run along, Cedric.

821
01:18:09,273 --> 01:18:12,693
I'll go to the police station to make
sure they're looking for Kevin.

822
01:18:12,943 --> 01:18:14,653
I want you to stay here.

823
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:17,072
- I'm going to look for him.
- What?

824
01:18:17,322 --> 01:18:21,368
With all due respect, your son is lost
in one of the world's biggest cities.

825
01:18:22,703 --> 01:18:24,496
Could you stay out of this?

826
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:26,165
As you wish.

827
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:31,461
Thank you. It's not a good idea
to run around New Y ork City alone.

828
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:33,338
If Kevin can, so can l.

829
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:34,673
- Kate--
- I'll be fine.

830
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:37,843
The way I feel, no mugger
or murderer would mess with me.

831
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:43,390
There are hundreds of armed
parasites out there!

832
01:18:45,476 --> 01:18:48,228
Do bundle up.
It's awfully cold outside.

833
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:24,097
Marv. Marv.

834
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:26,058
Come on, let's go.

835
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:47,830
Marv.

836
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,832
Crowbars up!

837
01:19:55,712 --> 01:19:57,714
Merry Christmas, Harry!

838
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:04,346
Happy Hanukkah, Marv!

839
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:16,817
This is more money
than I can even count!

840
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:21,321
It makes you wonder why we spent
so much time robbing homes.

841
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:37,838
The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law...

842
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:42,134
...we're up to our elbows in cash
and nobody even knows about it.

843
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,015
He's back!

844
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:50,767
He took our picture!

845
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:52,311
How was my hair?

846
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:01,987
This is it. No turning back.

847
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:04,907
Another Christmas in the trenches.

848
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:07,910
No!

849
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:14,750
Wow.

850
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,211
That's it! Get the money!
Get it!

851
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:24,593
I'll kill him!

852
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:29,139
- Marv!
- I'm coming, Harry!

853
01:21:38,357 --> 01:21:39,650
Harry?

854
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:43,695
Harry!

855
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:45,364
That was incredible.

856
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:51,912
- I twisted my ankle.
- Where is he?

857
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,373
Hey, guys! Smile!

858
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,377
Come on! Come on!

859
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:00,504
- Help me.
- I got you.

860
01:22:00,921 --> 01:22:02,297
I got you.

861
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:31,034
Taxi!

862
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,125
Times Square!

863
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,273
Where'd he go?

864
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:03,984
I'm up here! Come get me!

865
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:07,654
Let's kill!

866
01:23:07,905 --> 01:23:09,615
Hold on, pea-brain.

867
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:13,619
We got busted because we underestimated
that bundle of misery.

868
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:15,120
This ain't like that.

869
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:19,833
This ain't his house. The kid's
running scared. He ain't got a plan.

870
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:23,003
May I do the thinking, please?

871
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:25,339
Thank you.

872
01:23:27,633 --> 01:23:28,509
Sonny!

873
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:30,093
Yes?

874
01:23:30,427 --> 01:23:34,097
Nothing would thrill me
more greatly than to shoot you.

875
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:37,726
Knocking off a youngster
won't mean that much to me.

876
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:39,353
- Understand?
- Mm-hm.

877
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:43,315
But since we're in a hurry,
I'll make a deal with you.

878
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:47,402
You throw down your camera
and we won't hurt you.

879
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:52,241
You'll never hear from us again.
Okay?

880
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:53,575
Promise?

881
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:57,830
I cross my heart and hope to die.

882
01:23:58,664 --> 01:24:00,290
Okay!

883
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:07,047
Okay, kid...

884
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:09,049
...give it to me.

885
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,392
Direct hit!

886
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:26,567
How many fingers am I holding up?

887
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:30,320
Eight?

888
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:37,619
Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead, throw another one.

889
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,705
Don't do that!

890
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:46,753
If you can't do any better than that,
you're going to lose.

891
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,882
Harry...

892
01:24:50,299 --> 01:24:51,341
...no.

893
01:24:57,764 --> 01:24:59,725
You got any more?

894
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,771
Get up.
He don't have any more bricks.

895
01:25:11,904 --> 01:25:13,071
What?

896
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:16,200
What?

897
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:19,786
What?

898
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:26,376
That did it! Nobody throws bricks
at me and gets away with it. Come on!

899
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:28,921
You go this way. I'll go around back.

900
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:34,968
Harry?

901
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:38,096
Harry?

902
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:41,433
Harry?

903
01:26:04,665 --> 01:26:05,833
Huh?

904
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:08,247
Harry!

905
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,541
I reached the top!

906
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:26,390
Ahh.

907
01:29:02,926 --> 01:29:05,220
You better do better than this.

908
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:31,455
Wow!

909
01:29:31,705 --> 01:29:33,540
What a hole!

910
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:55,813
Whoa!

911
01:30:13,038 --> 01:30:13,872
Uh-oh.

912
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:43,235
Ah!

913
01:33:41,163 --> 01:33:42,956
Harry.

914
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:05,479
I'm coming up!

915
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:12,569
Uh-oh.

916
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,412
I'm gonna murder that kid!

917
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:41,723
Yes!

918
01:34:48,689 --> 01:34:49,898
Whoa.

919
01:34:58,657 --> 01:35:01,160
Whoa, whoa!

920
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:12,838
Hey!

921
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:16,008
Don't you know a kid always wins
against two idiots?

922
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:18,510
Harry! In the living room!

923
01:35:20,095 --> 01:35:21,722
He went up the ladder!

924
01:35:36,695 --> 01:35:38,280
Oh.

925
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:40,991
I'm coming, Harry.

926
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:42,701
I'm coming.

927
01:35:47,915 --> 01:35:49,124
Harry!

928
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:55,005
You didn't lose any teeth!
Come on, he went to the second floor.

929
01:35:55,506 --> 01:35:56,423
Hey!

930
01:35:56,632 --> 01:35:57,966
Try the stairs.

931
01:35:58,801 --> 01:36:00,260
Right.

932
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:04,973
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

933
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,683
Remember last year?

934
01:36:08,018 --> 01:36:08,852
No.

935
01:36:09,478 --> 01:36:11,230
Watch this.

936
01:36:11,688 --> 01:36:13,524
Let's get him!

937
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:18,529
Ow!

938
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:21,865
He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!

939
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:23,242
That's one.

940
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:25,577
Don't worry, Harry.

941
01:36:26,829 --> 01:36:28,622
I'll get him.

942
01:36:33,377 --> 01:36:34,378
Ow!

943
01:36:35,254 --> 01:36:37,506
Right in the schnoz.

944
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:39,633
That's two.

945
01:36:39,883 --> 01:36:41,426
Come on, let's get him.

946
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:45,305
Oops.

947
01:36:53,272 --> 01:36:54,523
That's...

948
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:56,108
...three.

949
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:03,031
No.

950
01:37:05,242 --> 01:37:07,244
That's four.

951
01:37:12,124 --> 01:37:15,252
- Come on, Harry.
- Marv, are you sure this is safe?

952
01:37:16,503 --> 01:37:18,672
I've worked all the kinks out.

953
01:37:18,922 --> 01:37:20,382
Solid as a rock.

954
01:37:37,483 --> 01:37:39,693
Like a rock, huh?

955
01:37:39,943 --> 01:37:40,861
Give up?

956
01:37:41,195 --> 01:37:44,448
- Have you had enough pain?
- Never!

957
01:37:55,751 --> 01:37:58,462
You better say every prayer
you ever heard!

958
01:37:58,712 --> 01:38:01,256
I hope your parents got you
a tombstone for Christmas.

959
01:38:04,092 --> 01:38:05,427
Where'd he go?

960
01:38:05,677 --> 01:38:08,305
I'm up here and I'm really scared.

961
01:38:18,190 --> 01:38:19,900
What's that sound?

962
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,422
That was the sound of a tool chest...

963
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:45,175
...falling down the stairs.

964
01:38:45,384 --> 01:38:46,593
Oh.

965
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,641
Yes!

966
01:39:27,676 --> 01:39:29,052
Over there!

967
01:39:29,428 --> 01:39:32,264
Even if I get the chair,
I'm killing that kid!

968
01:39:35,017 --> 01:39:36,602
Surrender, kid!

969
01:39:37,227 --> 01:39:38,061
He vanished.

970
01:39:38,312 --> 01:39:40,022
I'm here, you horse's ass!

971
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:44,943
Whoa.

972
01:39:45,194 --> 01:39:46,695
Nice night for a neck injury!

973
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:51,116
Suck brick, kid!

974
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:58,749
Come on, Marv.

975
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:00,083
I don't know.

976
01:40:00,334 --> 01:40:02,252
I said, come on!

977
01:40:03,879 --> 01:40:06,048
Come on, you big sissy.

978
01:40:20,103 --> 01:40:22,648
Harry? You wearing aftershave?

979
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:24,691
That's kerosene.

980
01:40:25,484 --> 01:40:27,736
The rope is soaked in it.

981
01:40:27,986 --> 01:40:30,531
Why would anyone soak a rope
in kerosene?

982
01:40:35,494 --> 01:40:37,579
Merry Christmas.

983
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:38,622
Go up!

984
01:41:14,283 --> 01:41:15,909
Get off me!

985
01:41:39,141 --> 01:41:40,726
Get the bag!

986
01:41:41,393 --> 01:41:44,438
Two guys who robbed Duncan's Toy Chest
are in the park.

987
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:49,610
Central Park West, 95th Street. Look
for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun.

988
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:57,034
I'm here.

989
01:41:57,284 --> 01:42:00,370
Better come and get me
before I call the cops.

990
01:42:07,753 --> 01:42:08,921
Whoa!

991
01:42:15,385 --> 01:42:18,138
My, how the tables have turned.

992
01:42:18,388 --> 01:42:19,848
How do you like the ice?

993
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:28,565
Let's go for a little stroll
in the park.

994
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:46,750
Give me the bag.

995
01:42:47,042 --> 01:42:48,502
Give me it!

996
01:42:53,382 --> 01:42:55,509
Great for the album.

997
01:42:56,510 --> 01:43:00,180
You may've won the battle, dude,
but you lost the war.

998
01:43:01,056 --> 01:43:02,975
You ought not of messed with us.

999
01:43:03,475 --> 01:43:04,476
We're dangerous.

1000
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:12,568
- Harry?
- Shut up!

1001
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:18,115
Harry.

1002
01:43:18,574 --> 01:43:20,909
Shut up! I want to enjoy this.

1003
01:43:21,827 --> 01:43:23,453
Something's wrong.

1004
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:26,165
- Let's get out of here!
- Shut up!

1005
01:43:28,417 --> 01:43:30,419
I never made it to the 6th grade...

1006
01:43:31,378 --> 01:43:34,381
...and it doesn't look like
you're gonna either.

1007
01:43:35,466 --> 01:43:36,925
Let him go!

1008
01:43:37,259 --> 01:43:38,635
Kevin, run!

1009
01:43:40,512 --> 01:43:41,889
Shoot her!

1010
01:43:42,097 --> 01:43:43,765
Shoot her!

1011
01:43:44,016 --> 01:43:45,934
- Shoot her!
- I'm trying!

1012
01:44:26,141 --> 01:44:27,226
Bye! Thanks.

1013
01:44:53,877 --> 01:44:56,547
Jesus, looks like the 4th of July!

1014
01:44:57,256 --> 01:44:59,216
We got the bridge.
Take the tunnel.

1015
01:44:59,466 --> 01:45:00,843
Let's go, let's go!

1016
01:45:08,767 --> 01:45:10,227
Oh, my God!

1017
01:45:21,029 --> 01:45:22,239
All right, let's go.

1018
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:24,199
Come on, on your feet.

1019
01:45:29,037 --> 01:45:33,709
You guys should've started earlier.
The prisoners already exchanged gifts.

1020
01:45:33,959 --> 01:45:35,586
We missed the presents?

1021
01:45:35,836 --> 01:45:39,423
He made us hide in the store
and steal the kiddies' charity money.

1022
01:45:39,673 --> 01:45:41,550
Shut up, Marv.

1023
01:45:43,427 --> 01:45:45,554
You've got the right to remain silent.

1024
01:45:45,971 --> 01:45:48,932
He's a little cranky.
We just broke out of prison.

1025
01:45:49,183 --> 01:45:50,976
Shut up, Marv!

1026
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,812
Get them out of here!

1027
01:45:54,062 --> 01:45:55,522
If this makes the papers...

1028
01:45:55,772 --> 01:45:59,318
...we're no longer the Wet Bandits,
we're the Sticky Bandits.

1029
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:01,570
That's sticky. S...

1030
01:46:02,696 --> 01:46:04,114
...T...

1031
01:46:04,698 --> 01:46:06,283
- l.
- l.

1032
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:21,965
It's all over. We apprehended
the thieves and got your money.

1033
01:46:22,216 --> 01:46:25,594
I want to get that money
over to the Children's Hospital.

1034
01:46:25,803 --> 01:46:28,514
- I'll handle it.
- Thank you.

1035
01:46:29,306 --> 01:46:30,557
Excuse me.

1036
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:34,478
I found this note. Looks like
a kid broke your window.

1037
01:46:35,187 --> 01:46:36,438
Dear Mr. Duncan:

1038
01:46:36,688 --> 01:46:39,483
I broke your window
to catch the bad guys.

1039
01:46:39,733 --> 01:46:41,235
Do you have insurance?

1040
01:46:41,485 --> 01:46:44,947
If not, I'll send you some money,
if I ever get home.

1041
01:46:45,197 --> 01:46:47,157
Merry Christmas.
Kevin McCallister.

1042
01:46:47,491 --> 01:46:50,202
P. S. Thanks for the turtledoves.

1043
01:46:51,411 --> 01:46:53,080
T urtledoves.

1044
01:46:54,248 --> 01:46:55,415
Oh.

1045
01:47:02,756 --> 01:47:05,467
Excuse me. I' m looking for my son.
This boy here.

1046
01:47:08,303 --> 01:47:12,224
Please help me. This boy right here.
Have you seen him?

1047
01:47:21,358 --> 01:47:24,778
I'm looking for my son.
He's been missing for two days.

1048
01:47:25,028 --> 01:47:27,865
- Have you filed a report?
- Of course we have.

1049
01:47:29,825 --> 01:47:32,494
Then trust us. We'll handle it.

1050
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:35,456
Oh.

1051
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:38,542
I'm his mother.

1052
01:47:40,252 --> 01:47:42,921
I know, but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

1053
01:47:44,423 --> 01:47:45,591
Do you have kids?

1054
01:47:46,925 --> 01:47:47,759
Yes, ma'am.

1055
01:47:48,051 --> 01:47:49,761
What if one was missing?

1056
01:47:52,347 --> 01:47:54,850
I'd probably do the same thing
you're doing.

1057
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:57,269
Thank you.

1058
01:48:00,022 --> 01:48:01,815
Put yourself in his shoes.

1059
01:48:02,232 --> 01:48:04,151
What would you do?

1060
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:07,779
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

1061
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:10,699
But not Kevin.

1062
01:48:10,908 --> 01:48:14,578
No. Kevin is so much stronger
and braver than I am.

1063
01:48:15,496 --> 01:48:18,123
I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is.

1064
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:22,377
But he's still alone in a big city.

1065
01:48:23,295 --> 01:48:25,088
He doesn't deserve that.

1066
01:48:25,339 --> 01:48:29,802
He deserves to be at home with his own
family around his Christmas tree.

1067
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:34,807
Oh, dear God...

1068
01:48:35,724 --> 01:48:37,267
...I know where he is.

1069
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:40,562
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.

1070
01:48:40,813 --> 01:48:43,065
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

1071
01:48:47,361 --> 01:48:51,532
I know I don't deserve a Christmas
even if I did do a good deed.

1072
01:48:52,491 --> 01:48:54,034
I don't want any presents.

1073
01:48:54,368 --> 01:48:58,330
Instead, I want to take back every mean
thing I ever said to my family...

1074
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:00,791
...even if they don't do the same.

1075
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:05,295
I don't care. I love all of them.
Including Buzz.

1076
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:09,675
If I can't see all of them,
could I just see my mother?

1077
01:49:10,551 --> 01:49:14,638
I'll never want another thing, ever.
I just want my mother.

1078
01:49:15,222 --> 01:49:16,682
I know it won't be tonight...

1079
01:49:17,015 --> 01:49:21,061
...but promise me I can see her again.
Sometime. Anytime.

1080
01:49:22,062 --> 01:49:25,440
Even if it's just once
and only for a few minutes.

1081
01:49:25,774 --> 01:49:28,068
I need to tell her I'm sorry.

1082
01:49:36,493 --> 01:49:37,870
Kevin?

1083
01:49:44,084 --> 01:49:44,918
Mom?

1084
01:49:47,629 --> 01:49:49,339
That worked fast!

1085
01:50:00,267 --> 01:50:01,727
Oh, Kevin.

1086
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:04,938
Mom, I'm sorry.

1087
01:50:06,773 --> 01:50:08,400
I'm sorry too.

1088
01:50:20,996 --> 01:50:22,539
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1089
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:27,002
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1090
01:50:28,504 --> 01:50:29,963
Thank you.

1091
01:50:30,631 --> 01:50:31,715
Let's go.

1092
01:50:32,633 --> 01:50:34,009
How'd you know I was here?

1093
01:50:34,259 --> 01:50:37,012
I know you and Christmas trees,
and this is the biggest.

1094
01:50:37,262 --> 01:50:38,514
Where's everyone else?

1095
01:50:38,764 --> 01:50:41,683
At the hotel.
They didn't like palm trees either.

1096
01:51:25,769 --> 01:51:28,188
Holy smokes, it's morning!

1097
01:51:29,565 --> 01:51:31,900
It's Christmas morning, man.

1098
01:51:33,026 --> 01:51:35,028
Don't get your hopes up.

1099
01:51:35,571 --> 01:51:36,446
Huh?

1100
01:51:36,697 --> 01:51:38,574
I don't think Santa visits hotels.

1101
01:51:38,907 --> 01:51:41,118
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.

1102
01:51:41,326 --> 01:51:42,828
He goes everywhere.

1103
01:51:44,663 --> 01:51:46,373
Wake up, it's Christmas!

1104
01:51:51,044 --> 01:51:53,297
Mom! Dad! It's Christmas!

1105
01:52:05,809 --> 01:52:07,311
Wow.

1106
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:09,021
Where'd it come from?

1107
01:52:09,271 --> 01:52:11,732
Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!

1108
01:52:15,569 --> 01:52:17,154
- My gosh!
- Peter!

1109
01:52:17,863 --> 01:52:19,781
Are we in the right room?

1110
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:27,039
Don't open any of mine.

1111
01:52:27,414 --> 01:52:30,167
- Who's Mr. Duncan?
- Duncan? I don't know.

1112
01:52:30,667 --> 01:52:32,002
Everybody calm down.

1113
01:52:32,336 --> 01:52:34,463
Calm down!

1114
01:52:35,214 --> 01:52:36,799
All right. Now...

1115
01:52:37,299 --> 01:52:40,928
...if Kevin hadn't screwed up in
the first place, again...

1116
01:52:41,637 --> 01:52:44,223
...we wouldn't be
in this most perfect...

1117
01:52:44,473 --> 01:52:47,184
...and huge hotel room
with all this free stuff.

1118
01:52:47,976 --> 01:52:48,811
So...

1119
01:52:49,144 --> 01:52:52,648
...I think it only fair that Kevin
get to open the first gift.

1120
01:52:54,066 --> 01:52:56,777
Then I'll go and the rest
of you and so on.

1121
01:53:01,323 --> 01:53:02,950
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1122
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,702
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1123
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:09,373
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1124
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:12,918
All right! Merry Christmas!

1125
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:16,213
Enough gooey sh--

1126
01:53:17,172 --> 01:53:19,842
Show of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!

1127
01:53:22,594 --> 01:53:26,598
Everybody, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

1128
01:54:02,676 --> 01:54:04,511
Merry Christmas.

1129
01:54:06,722 --> 01:54:07,723
Kevin!

1130
01:54:07,931 --> 01:54:09,600
Merry Christmas!

1131
01:54:10,434 --> 01:54:11,768
I got something for you.

1132
01:54:20,277 --> 01:54:21,278
What's this?

1133
01:54:21,904 --> 01:54:24,656
It's a turtledove. I have one.
You have one.

1134
01:54:24,907 --> 01:54:28,702
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

1135
01:54:32,706 --> 01:54:35,250
Oh, Kevin.

1136
01:54:38,045 --> 01:54:39,505
Thank you.

1137
01:54:40,964 --> 01:54:43,634
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1138
01:55:11,703 --> 01:55:13,705
The room service bill, sir.

1139
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,417
Merry Christmas.

1140
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:20,295
Uh, oh.

1141
01:55:24,007 --> 01:55:25,342
Nice family.

1142
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:26,677
Really.

1143
01:55:36,019 --> 01:55:37,604
Merry Christmas indeed.

1144
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:42,818
Kevin!

1145
01:55:43,068 --> 01:55:45,863
You spent $967 on room service?!

1146
01:59:59,032 --> 02:00:00,075
