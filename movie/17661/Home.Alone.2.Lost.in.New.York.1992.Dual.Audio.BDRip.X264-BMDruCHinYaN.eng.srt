to let me in the hotel room...

We'll notify the credit card companies.

If your son has the cards...

we can get a location on him when and if he uses them.

00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:25,426
The only stores that'll have cash on hand...

663
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:28,555
are ones that deal in moderate-priced goods.

667

668

KEVlN: Mr. Duncan must be a pretty nice guy...

709
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:41,490
Ietting all the kids come into his store...

710

and play with his toys.

711
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:44,925

all the money the store takes in today...

716
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:56,598
Mr. Duncan is donating it to the Children's Hospital...

717
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:58,937
and the day after Christmas...

718
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,138
we empty all the money in the cash register...

719
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:05,669
and Mr. Duncan just takes it right down to the hospital.

720
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:07,340
That's very generous of him.

721
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:11,113
Well, children bring him a lot of joy...

722
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:14,452
as they do to everyone who appreciates them.

723
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:21,623
I'm not supposed to spend this money...

724
00:48:21,664 --> 00:48:23,723
but I have twenty dollars from shoveling snow...

725
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:25,063
in a jar in our garage...

726

where my older brother can't find it.

727
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:29,196
So I'll pay my mother back with that.

728
00:48:29,238 --> 00:48:31,206
You can give this to Mr. Duncan.

729
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,504
The hospital needs it more than I do.

730
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:35,533
Besides, I'll probably spend it on stuff...

731
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:38,308
that'll rot my teeth and my mind.

and you give the other one to a very special person.

747
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,113
turtledoves are a symbol of friendship and love.

748

Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie...

995
01:09:00,335 --> 01:09:02,326
Frank Sinatra...

996
01:09:02,403 --> 01:09:03,802
Luciano Pavarotti.

997
01:09:09,677 --> 01:09:11,474
So, do you bring your friends up here?

998
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:15,179
I haven't got many friends.

999
01:09:15,216 --> 01:09:17,616
Oh. Sorry.

1000
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:19,948
I'm like the birds I care for.

1001
01:09:21,422 --> 01:09:22,753
People pass me in the street.

1002
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,258
They see me, but they try to ignore me.

1003
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:27,818
They'd prefer I wasn't part of their city.

1004
01:09:27,862 --> 01:09:29,193
Yeah.

1005
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,221
It's sorta like that with my family.

1006
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:33,234
I'm kinda the pigeon of the house...

1007
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:35,133
just because I'm the youngest.

1008
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,494
Everyone fights for position.

1009
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,168
Everybody wants to be seen...

1010
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:41,334
and heard.

1011
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:43,139
I guess so.

1012
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:45,237
I'm seen and heard pretty much...

1013
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,271
but then I get sent to my room a lot, too.

1014
01:09:50,285 --> 01:09:52,913
I wasn't always like this, you know.

1015
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:54,683
Oh. What were you like before?

1016
01:09:56,057 --> 01:09:57,490
I had a job...

1017
01:09:57,525 --> 01:09:59,152
I had a home...

1018
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:00,320
I had a family.

1019
01:10:00,361 --> 01:10:01,521
Did you have any kids?

1020
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:03,924
No.

1021
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:06,259
Oh, I wanted them...

1022
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:09,270
but the man I loved...

1023
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:10,771
fell out of love with me.

1024
01:10:11,639 --> 01:10:13,106
That broke my heart.

1025
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:16,568
And whenever the chance to be loved came along again...

1026
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:19,043
I ran away from it.

1027
01:10:20,248 --> 01:10:21,943
I stopped trusting people.

1028
01:10:21,983 --> 01:10:23,450
No offense...

1029
01:10:23,484 --> 01:10:26,317
but that seems like sort of a dumb thing to do.

1030
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,879
I was afraid of getting my heart broken again.

1031
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:32,185
You see, sometimes you can trust a person...

1032
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:34,695
and then, when things are down...

1033
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:36,560
they forget about you.

1034
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:39,328
Maybe they're just too busy.

1035
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,697
Maybe they don't forget about you...

1036
01:10:40,768 --> 01:10:43,396
but they forget to remember you.

1037
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:45,234
I don't think people mean to forget.

1038
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:47,503
I think it just happens.

1039
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:50,204
My grandfather says if my head wasn't screwed on...

1040
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:51,872
I'd leave it on the school bus.

1041
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:53,904
I'm just afraid if I do trust someone...

1042
01:10:53,948 --> 01:10:56,246
I'll get my heart broken again.

1043
01:10:56,284 --> 01:10:57,649
KEVlN: I understand that.

1044
01:10:57,685 --> 01:11:00,620
I used to have a really nice pair of roller blades.

1045
01:11:00,655 --> 01:11:03,215
I was afraid I'd wreck them...

1046
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:04,782
so I kept them in the box.

1047
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:06,919
-You know what happened? -No.

1048
01:11:06,961 --> 01:11:08,087
I outgrew them.

1049
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:09,721
I never wore them once outside...

1050
01:11:09,764 --> 01:11:11,959
just in my room a couple of times.

1051
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:14,968
A person's heart and a person's feelings...

1052
01:11:15,003 --> 01:11:17,096
are very different than skates.

1053
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:19,268
Well, they're kind of the same thing.

1054
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,275
If you aren't going to use your heart...

1055
01:11:21,309 --> 01:11:23,300
then what's the difference if it gets broken?

1056
01:11:23,344 --> 01:11:25,278
If you just keep it to yourself...

1057
01:11:25,313 --> 01:11:27,543
maybe it'll be like my roller blades--

1058
01:11:27,582 --> 01:11:29,550
when you do decide to try it...

1059
01:11:29,584 --> 01:11:31,211
it won't be any good.

1060
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:32,719
You should take a chance.

1061
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:34,278
You got nothing to lose.

1062
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,621
A bit of truth in there somewhere.

1063
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:39,126
I think so.

1064
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,855
Your heart might still be broken...

1065
01:11:40,895 --> 01:11:42,362
but it isn't gone.

1066
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:44,888
If it was gone, you wouldn't be this nice.

1067
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:47,298
Thank you.

1068
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:51,099
Do you know that it's been...

1069
01:11:52,874 --> 01:11:55,638
a couple of years since I've talked to anybody?

1070
01:11:55,677 --> 01:11:58,077
That's OK. You're really good at it.

1071
01:11:58,112 --> 01:11:59,238
You're not boring.

1072
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,077
You don't mumble or spit when you talk.

1073
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:03,242
You should do it more often.

1074
01:12:03,284 --> 01:12:04,581
You just have to wear an outfit...

1075
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:06,211
that doesn't have pigeon poop on it.

1076
01:12:06,254 --> 01:12:08,245
[Woman laughs]

1077
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:10,724
Oh, I have been working very hard...

1078
01:12:10,758 --> 01:12:13,249
at keeping people away, haven't l?

1079
01:12:13,294 --> 01:12:16,024
I always think I'll have a lot of fun if I'm alone...

1080
01:12:16,064 --> 01:12:18,464
but being alone isn't much fun.

1081
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:21,229
I don't care how much people bug me sometimes...

1082
01:12:21,302 --> 01:12:24,328
I'd rather be with somebody than by myself.

1083
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,830
So what are you doing running around the streets...

1084
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:28,341
on Christmas Eve alone?

1085
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:30,344
Did you get into trouble?

1086
01:12:30,378 --> 01:12:32,437
Yeah.

1087
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,004
WOMAN: You've done something wrong?

1088
01:12:34,048 --> 01:12:35,572
A lot of things.

1089
01:12:37,985 --> 01:12:41,648
Did you know that a good deed erases a bad deed?

1090
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:43,122
It's getting pretty late.

1091
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:45,182
I don't know if I'll have enough time...

1092
01:12:45,226 --> 01:12:47,888
to erase all the bad deeds I did.

1093
01:12:47,929 --> 01:12:49,726
Well, it's Christmas Eve.

1094
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:51,527
Good deeds count for extra tonight.

1095
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:54,591
-They do? -Of course they do.

1096
01:12:54,669 --> 01:12:56,899
So you must think of the most important thing...

1097
01:12:56,938 --> 01:12:58,462
that you can do for others...

1098
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:00,166
and go and do it.

1099
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:03,170
Just follow the star in your own heart.

1100
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:06,269
OK.

1101
01:13:07,281 --> 01:13:08,748
It's getting pretty late.

1102
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:10,273
I better get going.

1103
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:20,757
If I don't see you again, I hope everything turns out OK.

1104
01:13:20,795 --> 01:13:22,126
Thank you.

1105
01:13:23,331 --> 01:13:24,889
Say good-bye to your birds for me.

1106
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:26,092
Oh, I will.

1107
01:13:34,809 --> 01:13:35,935
Merry Christmas.

1108
01:13:35,977 --> 01:13:37,376
Merry Christmas.

1109
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:40,870
If you need somebody to trust, it can be me.

1110
01:13:40,915 --> 01:13:43,247
I won't forget to remember you.

1111
01:13:44,285 --> 01:13:46,253
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1112
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:08,736
CHlLDREN SlNGlNG: Distant stars at home up in the heavens

1113
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:12,234
Wonder what they see

1114
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,738
Are they watching me?

1115
01:14:15,783 --> 01:14:18,752
Christmas star

1116
01:14:18,786 --> 01:14:23,086
You watch the world so wisely

1117
01:14:23,124 --> 01:14:27,060
At my journey's end

1118
01:14:27,094 --> 01:14:30,154
Will you be my true friend?

1119
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:33,997
Starlight, shine bright

1120
01:14:34,068 --> 01:14:38,004
See me through the dark night

1121
01:14:38,072 --> 01:14:41,838
Light my pathway

1122
01:14:41,876 --> 01:14:45,368
Guide me home for Christmas

1123
01:14:45,413 --> 01:14:47,711
DUNCAN: All the money in the cash register...

1124
01:14:47,748 --> 01:14:51,411
Mr. Duncan is going to donate to the Children's Hospital.

1125
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:55,682
MARV: At midnight tonight, we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

1126
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:57,714
You can mess with a lot of things...

1127
01:14:57,758 --> 01:15:00,727
but you can't mess with kids on Christmas.

1128
01:17:21,268 --> 01:17:22,360
CONClERGE: We'd like to offer you...

1129
01:17:22,436 --> 01:17:24,529
a complimentary suite while you're here.

1130
01:17:25,272 --> 01:17:27,740
It's a penthouse with a view of the park.

1131
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:28,901
I think you'll find it satisfactory.

1132
01:17:28,943 --> 01:17:32,470
It was recently vacated by the Countess of Worcestershire.

1133
01:17:32,513 --> 01:17:35,846
What kind of hotel allows a child to check in alone?

1134
01:17:35,883 --> 01:17:38,545
The boy had a very convincing story.

1135
01:17:38,586 --> 01:17:40,986
What kind of idiots are working here?

1136
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:44,489
The finest in New York.

1137
01:17:44,525 --> 01:17:46,891
PETER: When you discovered the credit card was stolen--

1138
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:49,020
I made the discovery.

1139
01:17:49,063 --> 01:17:50,587
Why did you let him leave?

1140
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:53,590
When we attempted to confront him, he ran.

1141
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:54,828
You scared him away.

1142
01:17:54,902 --> 01:17:57,029
KATE: It's Christmas Eve, and because of you...

1143
01:17:57,104 --> 01:17:59,572
our child is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world.

1144
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,936
Could you take our family and our luggage up to the room?

1145
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,379
Yes, sir.

1146
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:08,814
Run along, Cedric.

1147
01:18:08,849 --> 01:18:10,544
I'm going down to the police station...

1148
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:12,711
and make sure they're trying to find Kevin.

1149
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:14,550
I want you to stay with the kids.

1150
01:18:14,588 --> 01:18:17,079
-No. I'm going to look for him. -What?

1151
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:18,557
With all due respect, madam...

1152
01:18:18,592 --> 01:18:21,390
your son is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world.

1153
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,498
Could you stay out of this, please?

1154
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:26,123
As you wish.

1155
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,532
Thank you. I don't think it's a good idea...

01:48:15,154 --> 01:48:17,486
I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is.

1489
01:48:17,523 --> 01:48:19,320
Fine.

1490
01:48:19,358 --> 01:48:21,519
But he's still all by himself in a big city...

1491
01:48:22,895 --> 01:48:24,726
and he doesn't deserve that.

1492
01:48:24,763 --> 01:48:27,391
He deserves to be at home with his own family...

1493
01:48:27,433 --> 01:48:29,094
around his Christmas tree.

1494
01:48:32,771 --> 01:48:34,102
Oh, dear God.

1495
01:48:35,374 --> 01:48:36,602
I know where he is.

1496
01:48:37,576 --> 01:48:39,100
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.

1497
01:48:40,045 --> 01:48:41,171
Hop in.

1498
01:48:41,213 --> 01:48:42,737
Thank you.

1499
01:48:46,986 --> 01:48:49,045
KEVlN: I know I don't deserve a Christmas...

1500
01:48:49,121 --> 01:48:51,089
even if I did do a good deed.

1501
01:48:52,124 --> 01:48:53,682
I don't want any presents.

1502
01:48:53,759 --> 01:48:55,488
Instead, I want to take back...

1503
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:58,190
every mean thing I ever said to my family....

1504
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:00,460
even if they don't take back the things they said.

1505
01:49:00,499 --> 01:49:02,899
I don't care. I'll love all of them...

1506
01:49:03,903 --> 01:49:05,530
including Buzz.

1507
01:49:05,571 --> 01:49:09,337
If I can only see one, can I see my mother?

1508
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:12,902
I'll never want another thing as long as I live.

1509
01:49:12,945 --> 01:49:14,412
I just want my mother.

1510
01:49:14,446 --> 01:49:16,346
I know I won't see her tonight...

1511
01:49:16,382 --> 01:49:18,907
but promise me I can see her again...

1512
01:49:18,951 --> 01:49:20,942
sometime, anytime.

1513
01:49:20,986 --> 01:49:24,922
Even if it's just once and only for a couple of minutes.

1514
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:27,288
I just need to tell her I'm sorry.

1515
01:49:35,367 --> 01:49:36,527
Kevin?

1516
01:49:43,342 --> 01:49:44,502
Mom?

1517
01:49:47,212 --> 01:49:48,907
Wow. That worked fast.

1518
01:49:59,558 --> 01:50:00,855
KATE: Oh, Kevin.

1519
01:50:02,728 --> 01:50:04,628
Mom, I'm sorry.

1520
01:50:06,165 --> 01:50:07,655
I'm sorry, too.

1521
01:50:20,546 --> 01:50:22,207
KEVlN: Merry Christmas, Mom.

1522
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:26,677
KATE: Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1523
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,085
Thank you.

1524
01:50:30,155 --> 01:50:31,383
Let's go.

1525
01:50:32,391 --> 01:50:33,858
KEVlN: How'd you know I was here?

1526
01:50:33,926 --> 01:50:35,154
KATE: I know you and Christmas trees...

1527
01:50:35,194 --> 01:50:36,786
and this is the biggest around.

1528
01:50:36,829 --> 01:50:38,023
KEVlN: Where's everybody else?

1529
01:50:38,063 --> 01:50:39,189
KATE: They're at the hotel.

1530
01:50:39,231 --> 01:50:40,892
They didn't like the palm trees, either.

1531
01:51:03,455 --> 01:51:04,888
[Snoring]

1532
01:51:25,044 --> 01:51:27,774
Holy smokes! It's morning!

1533
01:51:29,148 --> 01:51:30,945
It's Christmas morning, man.

1534
01:51:32,384 --> 01:51:34,682
Fuller, don't get your hopes up.

1535
01:51:34,753 --> 01:51:36,243
FULLER: Huh?

1536
01:51:36,321 --> 01:51:38,255
I don't think Santa Claus visits hotels.

1537
01:51:38,290 --> 01:51:40,758
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.

1538
01:51:40,826 --> 01:51:42,521
He goes everywhere.

1539
01:51:44,163 --> 01:51:46,063
Hey, guys, wake up! It's Christmas!

1540
01:51:50,736 --> 01:51:51,862
Mom, Dad, it's Christmas!

1541
01:51:51,904 --> 01:51:53,064
FRANK: What?!

1542
01:51:56,675 --> 01:51:57,937
GlRL: What on earth?

1543
01:51:57,976 --> 01:51:59,466
JEFF: Come on. I wanna find out.

1544
01:52:04,983 --> 01:52:06,644
ROD: Oh, wow.

1545
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:08,687
JEFF: Where did it all come from?

1546
01:52:08,721 --> 01:52:10,780
KEVlN: Mom! Dad! You got to see this!

1547
01:52:15,394 --> 01:52:17,294
-Gosh. -Peter!

1548
01:52:17,329 --> 01:52:18,694
BUZZ: Are you sure we're in the right room?

1549
01:52:20,032 --> 01:52:22,227
-Look at all this stuff! -Yeah!

1550
01:52:22,267 --> 01:52:24,360
-Oh, wow! -Look!

1551
01:52:25,037 --> 01:52:26,698
FRANK: Don't open any of mine. I mean it.

1552
01:52:26,739 --> 01:52:28,206
Who's Mr. Duncan?

1553
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,299
KATE: Duncan? I don't know.

1554
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:31,639
All right. Everyone just calm down.

1555
01:52:31,677 --> 01:52:34,373
Calm down. Hey, hey!

1556
01:52:34,413 --> 01:52:36,438
All right. Now...

1557
01:52:36,482 --> 01:52:41,215
if Kevin hadn't screwed up in the first place again...

1558
01:52:41,286 --> 01:52:44,847
then we wouldn't be in this most perfect and huge hotel room...

1559
01:52:44,923 --> 01:52:46,857
with a truckload of all this free stuff...

1560
01:52:46,892 --> 01:52:48,519
so...

1561
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:49,686
I think it only fair...

1562
01:52:49,728 --> 01:52:52,356
that Kevin get to open up the first present.

1563
01:52:52,998 --> 01:52:54,124
Then I'll go...

1564
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:55,793
and the rest of you, and so on.

1565
01:53:00,272 --> 01:53:02,900
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1566
01:53:02,941 --> 01:53:04,704
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1567
01:53:07,379 --> 01:53:08,505
PETER: Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1568
01:53:08,547 --> 01:53:10,242
FRANK: OK, Kevin!

1569
01:53:10,282 --> 01:53:12,512
All right! Merry Christmas!

1570
01:53:14,586 --> 01:53:16,611
Enough of this gooey sh--

1571
01:53:16,688 --> 01:53:18,349
show...of emotion.

1572
01:53:18,423 --> 01:53:19,515
Everyone, let's dig in!

1573
01:53:19,591 --> 01:53:22,754
-All right! -Everybody, wait.

1574
01:53:22,795 --> 01:53:24,353
LESLlE: Save the paper. We can use it next year.

1575
01:53:24,396 --> 01:53:26,455
Give me the bows.

1576
01:54:02,034 --> 01:54:03,661
Merry Christmas.

1577
01:54:06,138 --> 01:54:07,571
Kevin!

1578
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:09,266
Merry Christmas!

1579
01:54:10,275 --> 01:54:11,435
I got something for you.

1580
01:54:19,818 --> 01:54:20,910
What's this?

1581
01:54:20,986 --> 01:54:22,453
It's a turtledove.

1582
01:54:22,487 --> 01:54:24,421
I have one, you have one.

1583
01:54:24,456 --> 01:54:26,356
As long as we each have a turtledove...

1584
01:54:26,391 --> 01:54:27,915
we'll be friends forever.

1585
01:54:31,964 --> 01:54:34,228
Oh, Kevin.

1586
01:54:37,236 --> 01:54:39,397
Thank you.

1587
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:42,903
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1588
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:52,810
WOMAN: Oh.

1589
01:55:11,169 --> 01:55:13,399
Mr. McCallister's room service bill, sir.

1590
01:55:15,507 --> 01:55:16,701
Merry Christmas, sir.

1591
01:55:18,076 --> 01:55:19,236
Uh, oh.

1592
01:55:23,282 --> 01:55:24,977
Nice family.

1593
01:55:25,017 --> 01:55:26,507
Really.

1594
01:55:35,394 --> 01:55:37,328
BUZZ: Merry Christmas, indeed.

1595
01:55:38,397 --> 01:55:40,695
Oh, Dad...

1596
01:55:40,732 --> 01:55:45,567
PETER: Kevin! You spent $967 on room service?!

1597
01:56:00,585 --> 01:56:01,882

Simply a matter of reason

01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:42,083
Just listen, you'll hear when they land on the roof
