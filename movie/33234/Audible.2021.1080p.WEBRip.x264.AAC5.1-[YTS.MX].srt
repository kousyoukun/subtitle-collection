3
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,296
It's not over.

4
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,927
Hey! Hey! This is not flag football!
This is real football!

5
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,596
I'm fine! Stop worrying about me!

6
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,307
What about you?

7
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,726
What the hell are you doing out there?

8
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,895
What the hell are you doing, man?

9
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,647
Hey! Hey! Take a seat.

10
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,774
Not in front of them!

11
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,612
Don't look at the scoreboard.
We're still alive! All right.

12
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,996
Stop feeling sorry for yourselves.

13
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,498
We're down by two touchdowns.

14
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,250
They're doing better
than we are, but that's fine!

15
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,085
We just need to man up!

16
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,881
If you see an opponent in front of you,
tackle him and get him down!

17
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,259
Quit being petty with them
and letting them get into your heads.

18
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,343
That's their goal!

19
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,220
They're trying to get you mad.

20
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,639
That's their goal.

21
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,642
It's the second half.
Focus on football, not them.

22
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,087
You have to be aggressive.

23
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,839
Now we gotta stay focused.

24
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:12,502
Hey, hey! Amaree! Stop! Amaree! Stop it!

25
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,674
Why? Why? Take a breath.
I need you the whole game.

26
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,343
When they talk trash to you,
don't get in their face like that.

27
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,261
Just be cool.

28
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,201
You can do better! We need you!

29
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,369
Hey, hey, hey, accept it.
You need to accept what happened.

30
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,288
You think I don't accept this?
Screw you, man.

31
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,916
All right, okay.
It's just one loss, man. It's nothing!

32
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,506
Will I see you later?

33
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,094
It's our first loss of the season.

34
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,472
I know we're all upset.

35
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:53,019
Don't let the nerves get to you.

36
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,273
We beat Texas last year, remember?

37
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,567
We had a long winning streak.

38
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,944
It's our senior year.
We gotta finish strong.

39
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:33,142
You M-A-M-M-A-S-B-O-Y.

40
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,483
I became deaf when I had meningitis.

41
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,611
I was born hearing.

42
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,948
And later, at two
or three years old, I lost my hearing.

43
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:52,078
I was sick and close to dying,
and I had a brain infection and swelling.

44
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,837
I can't hear anything.

45
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,296
I can't hear cheering,

46
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
the fans yelling.

47
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,509
I feel their vibration.

48
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:12,390
I feel their footsteps when they run,
the boom, boom, boom of the vibration.

49
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,646
The cochlear implant, or CI,

50
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,815
gives you more ability to hear.

51
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,025
I have the cochlear implant,

52
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:28,072
and I only use it to listen to music,
and that's it.

53
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,534
I can feel the vibrations
and I can hear the music,

54
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,162
but I don't hear the lyrics.

55
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:39,000
Music helps me stay focused and calm.

56
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,875
I'm not crazy into basketball.
Honestly, football, that's my thing.

57
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,129
You know what keeps me motivated?
Working hard.

58
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,549
That's why I don't like baseball.

59
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,802
You know
I don't like that bullshit... Right.

60
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,888
True, true.

61
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,556
You're dumb.

62
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,277
So, Lera, are you going
to homecoming with Amaree orâ€¦?

63
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,738
I'm not sure. We'll see how it goes.

64
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,533
If things are good with us,
then we might go together. We'll see.

65
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,786
Amaree said he didn't really wanna go,
so we'll see about that.

66
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,227
Football is one of the avenues for them

67
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,646
to show the world what we're made of.

68
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,897
That's not the only way,

69
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,191
but it's one of the many great ways
to put that on display.

70
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,987
From here on out,
we are seriously focused.

71
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,119
Our goal is
to win all the way to homecoming

72
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,288
and win that homecoming game.

73
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,253
With a Deaf team, because they don't hear,

74
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,672
I believe
their other senses are heightened.

75
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,009
Our players
have a better feel on the field,

76
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,553
and I believe they see things better
because they can't hear.

77
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,939
How do we communicate on the field?

78
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,191
We huddle up and shoot our plays out.
We have a secret code.

79
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,125
The drum
is a very important part of cheering.

80
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,628
Yeah, we feel that vibration,
and it's great.

81
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,899
No, no, watch. Follow me.

82
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,853
I'm the only Deaf person in my family.

83
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,148
Yeah, I do feel lonely.

84
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,483
When I was a kid,
they would just talk around me.

85
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,777
And I didn't understand any of it,
so I'd just go off on my own.

86
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:21,574
When I run into hearing people
out in the world,

87
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,910
I feel, as a Deaf person, I am alone.

88
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,787
That's Dad?

89
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,497
Yes.

90
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:36,213
I was about two years old
when my dad left.

91
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,843
I do wonder why my dad left.

92
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:45,139
Is it because I'm Deaf?
Maybe. I don't know.

93
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,012
Teddy's gone. He was my best friend.

94
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:48,327
Teddy was on our football team
at Maryland School for the Deaf.

95
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,582
Jalen and Teddy,
that was Jalen's first relationship.

96
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,043
Jalen's first love.

97
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,133
The reason
I was attracted to Teddy is he was funny.

98
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,344
He always made me laugh.

99
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,055
Not only that, but we could have
really good conversations.

100
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,807
We could talk about anything.

101
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,185
And then sophomore year,
he transferred to a hearing school.

102
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,730
They were asking him, "Hey, you're Deaf,
what are you doing here?"

103
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,233
"You should go back to the Deaf school."

104
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,867
He was being bullied
because of his Deafness.

105
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,996
And he was wearing hearing aids,
and they would flick his hearing aid off.

106
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,166
He just had so many issues going on.

107
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,837
His identity, his family, his friendsâ€¦
He was being bulliedâ€¦

108
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,382
There were so many things going on,
and it took a toll on him.

109
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,305
Teddy hanged himself.

110
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:40,856
Teddy was my close friend.
We grew up together.

111
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,984
When he killed himself,
it was a huge shock to us.

112
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,195
It had a really big impact
on our community.

113
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,281
I felt like I wanted to hurt myself,

114
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,369
because he was gone.

115
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,747
I wanted to hurt myself.
I tried to cut myself.

116
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,874
I felt angry.

117
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,295
It was a mixture of anger,
feeling upset, sadness.

118
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,632
I feel that, now that he's gone,

119
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,218
it's made it a little bit tougher.

120
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:14,682
He's gone, but Teddy's always
going to have a special place in my heart.

121
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,888
Discrimination is everywhere.

122
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,350
It's pretty much inevitable for them.

123
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,812
I think
it's how we react to the discrimination.

124
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,741
Ready, readyâ€¦

125
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,936
A lot of the hearing teams
don't want to play us.

126
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,315
And most coaches
don't like to lose to Deaf coaches.

127
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,735
Out in the hearing world,
they tend to look down on Deaf people,

128
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,489
and they don't think
we can do things as well.

129
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,617
So the way to prove them wrong
is to beat them,

130
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,620
to crush them on the field, and teach them
that Deaf people can do anything.

131
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,664
And we prove to them that we are the same.

132
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,986
In the game, when we go to huddle,
pay attention to the next play.

133
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,362
Get in and get out.

134
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,115
So make sure
you're looking at the play call,

135
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,451
not messing around
and talking to each other.

136
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,204
The important thing is,
this is our last game.

137
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,500
I need 110% effort out there.

138
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,087
Work hard.
We don't need any heroes out there.

139
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,425
Let's tackle it. And we'll get the win.

140
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,511
That's all it takes.
Not showin' off. No messin' around.

141
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,973
Hey, what about homecoming?

142
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,393
Me? Who am I gonna ask?

143
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,772
What about Lera?

144
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,318
I'm just askin'. Just askinâ€™.

145
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,405
She doesn't want me. She avoids me.

146
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,032
So I give her space.

147
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,035
Ya know? Thanks!

148
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,830
Yep! Well, "peace out."

149
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,791
I am copying your sign for that!

150
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,393
Hey, shut up! Blow out the candles!

151
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,182
Do you want to get some ice cream here?

152
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,154
Are you gonna pay?
Oh, am I paying for you?

153
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,989
I'm broke.

154
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,452
I'm just teasing you.

155
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,923
I'm just curious, what's goin' on with us?

156
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,217
What are we?

157
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:58,139
I don't know.
Are we together or we not? I don't know.

158
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,058
I'm a little scared.

159
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,811
We have a lot going on.

160
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,399
Are we together?

161
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,569
I had a strong throw.

162
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,071
You were a receiver?

163
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,239
-W-R.
-Oh, you were a wide receiver?

164
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,574
What happened?

165
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,869
Not now.
That was way back then. Way back.

166
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,329
Right, back in the day.

167
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,415
I was good!

168
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,958
-Oh, really?
-I was good.

169
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,545
Could you catch the ball
with only one hand?

170
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,090
When I was growing up without Dad,

171
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,841
he left,
and I was kind of disgusted with him.

172
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,343
It's tough.

173
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,971
It's difficult,
and my role model was gone.

174
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,849
But now I feel
like I'm connecting with Dad.

175
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,312
First down. Yeah.

176
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,094
So, tomorrow is our homecoming game
and our homecoming day.

177
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,638
It's homecoming.
We're expecting a big crowd.

178
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,432
We're playing the Virginia Spartans.

179
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,518
The Virginia Spartans are a hearing team.

180
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:52,230
It's my very last game.

181
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,483
I'm going to be very emotional about it.

182
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,846
You ready? Ready? The big announcement.

183
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,975
The homecoming king goes toâ€¦

184
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:17,106
Amaree McKenstry!

185
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,873
You know, any success is for Teddy.

186
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,418
When we win, we win for Teddy.

187
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,797
We keep him in our hearts.

188
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,519
Don't let up!
Let's come back stronger, together!

189
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,108
So don't give up! Don't give up! Come on!

190
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:47,668
I think their biggest challenge
is going to be coming out of this bubble.

191
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,671
Once they get out there,
it's not a guarantee.

192
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,007
So there are going to be
a lot of obstacles for them to face

193
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,802
that they haven't faced here on campus.

194
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,368
Life is short, you knowâ€¦

195
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,662
anything can happen at any time.

196
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,331
Just be who you want to be
and be yourself,

197
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,542
and that's all it needs to be.

198
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,044
Be yourself, you know?

199
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,188
You know, I'll be 18 soon.

200
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,440
I'll be graduating
and going out into the real world.

201
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,108
I need to be prepared for that.

202
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,653
And what scares me

203
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,114
is the unknown.

204
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,617
Things that can get fucked up.

205
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,369
Those challenges, you know,

206
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,496
when I'm out in the world,

207
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,416
help me learn.

208
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,461
And I'm ready for the world.

209
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:08,392
I LOVE YOU.
