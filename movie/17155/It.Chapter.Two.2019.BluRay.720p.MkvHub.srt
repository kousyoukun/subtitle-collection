00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:29,512
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

3
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:30,979
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

4
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:33,081
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

5
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,625
I saw all of us.

6
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:45,595
All of us were there.

7
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,464
Back in the cistern.

8
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,267
But we were older.

9
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,102
We were our parents' ages.

10
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:56,639
Am I still handsome
as an adult?

11
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,675
You grow into your looks.

12
00:00:59,742 --> 00:01:01,577
What the fuck does that mean?

13
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,247
What about me?

14
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:08,384
Like now,

15
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,552
but taller.

16
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,294
Swear it.

17
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:23,932
Swear if It isn't dead,

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,002
if It ever comes back,

19
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,270
we'll come back, too.

20
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,276
<i>Memory,</i>

21
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:38,046
<i>it's a funny thing.</i>

22
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,217
<i>People want to
believe they are</i>

23
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:43,985
<i>what they choose
to remember.</i>

24
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:46,988
<i>The good stuff.</i>

25
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:49,525
<i>The moments.</i>

26
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,261
<i>The places.</i>

27
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,066
<i>The people
we all hold on to.</i>

28
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,137
<i>But sometimes...</i>

29
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,107
<i>sometimes</i>

30
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:10,680
<i>we are what we wish
we could forget.</i>

31
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,638
Okay, kids.

32
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:37,640
Get ready.

33
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,007
Go!

34
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,176
Who's it gonna be?

35
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:42,721
First one to pop
their balloon's a winner!

36
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,580
It could be anyone!
We got a real

37
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,949
- barn burner here, folks.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

38
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,351
It's getting close.

39
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,019
Who's gonna catch the
leader, huh?

40
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,623
Who's gonna be
the big winner tonight?

41
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:54,891
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

42
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:57,660
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

43
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,094
- Thank you.
- Wow.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,730
You really showed 'em, huh?

45
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,163
I did. I...

46
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,400
Yeah.

47
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:08,404
Hey, girl, do you want this?

48
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,805
Thanks
for letting me win.

49
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,074
Yeah.

50
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,242
What'd you get, Vicky?

51
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:15,478
Aww.
Such a gentleman.

52
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:17,647
Look at that!

53
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:20,850
Well, here is
your consolation prize.

54
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,284
Look at that.

55
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:24,587
Never been a fan
of the beaver,

56
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,088
but look at this hat.
I mean...

57
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:28,791
Thank you.

58
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:34,597
So, we need
to talk logistics.

59
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,599
Ooh. How romantic.

60
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,266
Romantic?

61
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:41,202
What's so
fucking romantic, huh?

62
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,641
Hey.

63
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,586
Your mommas ever teach you
boys to respond to someone

64
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,244
when they ask you
a fucking question?

65
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,380
Come on, Adrian.

66
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,550
You got a problem, faggot?

67
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:59,789
I don't,
but Meg Ryan called.

68
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,090
She wants her wig back.

69
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,224
All right. All right.

70
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,193
Come on.
Come on, Adrian.

71
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:11,367
Stuff like that is

72
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:12,945
why I have to leave
this shithole town.

73
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,036
Small minds.

74
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:15,170
They have small dicks.

75
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:16,639
I'm being serious.

76
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:17,873
We belong elsewhere.

77
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,675
Hey, look,
if you end up hating New York,

78
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,078
we can always
move back here.

79
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,646
I just want
to be with you.

80
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:25,715
I don't care.
New York, Derry, whatever. It's...

81
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,248
You have to say that.

82
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:28,451
I don't have
to say anything.

83
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,553
Take off that fucking hat.

84
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,488
- Oh, God.
- Come on, let's go.

85
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:34,289
Wouldn't want to
give people the impression

86
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,068
we allow a bunch of fucking
fairies like you in this town.

87
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,560
Yeah, he was
born here, asshole.

88
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:40,463
- All right, let's go.
- No. You know what?

89
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:41,797
I'll take off the hat
for you.

90
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,432
But why leave it there?

91
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,900
Anything else
you would like me

92
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,636
to take off
for you tonight?

93
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:49,805
Any special requests, ladies?

94
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,174
Fucker!

95
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,978
Let him go!

96
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,185
- What's that?
- Stop.

97
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:06,122
I don't think
you'll be needing that.

98
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:08,156
- Leave him alone!
- Hit him.

99
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,893
He's got asthma, fucker!

100
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,567
Come on!

101
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,436
Fuck him up!

102
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,571
Come on,
kick him!

103
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:23,882
Come on,
kick the shit out of him.

104
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,775
Adrian!

105
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:32,247
I still hate
your fucking hair.

106
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,819
Adrian!

107
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:38,821
Get the fuck off him!

108
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,791
Look what you did
to his fucking face!

109
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,293
Hey! Hey!
Help me get him up.

110
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,796
Adrian.

111
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:49,598
Help me get this fucking
punk up right now.

112
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:57,740
Give me the hat, Chris.

113
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:58,774
It's fucking mine!

114
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,543
I said give me
the fucking hat!

115
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,013
Adrian!

116
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:06,549
You like that?

117
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,651
Welcome to Derry,
motherfucker.

118
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:12,054
No! Adrian!

119
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,489
No!

120
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,593
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

121
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,395
- Let's go!
- No!

122
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,869
Adrian!

123
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:28,971
Help!

124
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,007
Help me!

125
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,443
Somebody!

126
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:40,015
Somebody fucking help me!

127
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,464
Oh...

128
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,369
Adrian.

129
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,380
No!

130
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,086
Adrian!

131
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:28,329
<i>We all
float down here!</i>

132
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,669
<i>Thing is,</i>

133
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,639
<i>sometimes what we wish
was forgotten,</i>

134
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,643
<i>what we tried to
leave in the past,</i>

135
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,446
<i>won't stay there.</i>

136
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,017
<i>Units, please respond.</i>

137
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,963
<i>I'm getting reports of a
body found dismembered.</i>

138
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,421
<i>Come back.
Was that "dismembered"?</i>

139
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,789
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

140
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,066
<i>Scene is near
the south entrance</i>

141
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,425
<i>of the festival grounds.</i>

142
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:57,960
<i>Copy that. En route.</i>

143
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,261
<i>Any directive for TC?</i>

144
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:01,063
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

145
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,998
<i>Chief said to tape off
the Derry Street Bridge.</i>

146
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,801
<i>Sometimes,
it comes back for you.</i>

147
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,512
Ah.

148
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,849
Mr. Denbrough?
They need you on set.

149
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,690
We're just going to
go this way.

150
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,592
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
- No, don't!

151
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,193
Hey!
Clear the door!

152
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,571
<i>Oh, come on.
You've never seen Indiana Jones?</i>

153
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,463
Watch your back.

154
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,032
Hey, hey.
You a crewmember?

155
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:44,700
I'm the writer.

156
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:55,811
Your husband's here.

157
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,947
Hey!
Do you have the pages?

158
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:00,516
Everyone,
keep clear of the crane.

159
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:04,286
My friend,
a film needs an ending.

160
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,055
- You do know that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,123
You said that
you needed another day

162
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,558
to finish the pages,

163
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,635
and we're shooting this thing.
It's tonight.

164
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,694
That's, like, 17 hours...

165
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,995
Everybody, calm down, okay?

166
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,129
I'm calm.

167
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,965
I want you to be
happy with the movie.

168
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,766
You understand?
I'm on your side.

169
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,635
That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending...

170
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,203
Is terrible.

171
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,039
All due respect,
people loved your book. Loved.

172
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,574
They hated the ending.

173
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,343
You said
you liked the ending.

174
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,844
That was a lie.

175
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:31,046
- We gotta do better, okay?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:34,049
Audra, you have my notes.
Would you...

177
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:37,019
Okay, thank you very much.
Take me back to one, please.

178
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:38,320
Bye.

179
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,390
You have his notes?

180
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,392
He's not wrong.

181
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,126
You hate my endings, too?

182
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:45,594
Not all your endings.

183
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:46,729
But this...

184
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,797
- Okay.
- Just...

185
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,133
What? Do you want me
to keep lying to you

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,302
- just because I'm your wife?
- You're my wife?

187
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,870
No. No.
But you know what?

188
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,848
You've been blowing smoke
up my ass for eight years?

189
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:58,249
I guess I thought
you were someone else.

190
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:01,010
I have not been
blowing smoke up your ass.

191
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,212
Everybody wants
a happy ending.

192
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,613
Everybody wants closure.

193
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,281
But that's not
the way life works out.

194
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:08,684
I think what Peter wants
and what the studio wants...

195
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,186
The studio?
When'd you become a company man?

196
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,721
Jesus, you're an artist.

197
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,232
Come on.
What's wrong with just doing it

198
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,991
the way it's written?
The way I wanted.

199
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,058
What's wrong with being
the woman I want you to be?

200
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,496
Fuck you, Bill.

201
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,631
On the page.
The part, I mean. Not you.

202
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,005
Hello?

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,876
<i>Bill Denbrough?
It's Mike.</i>

204
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:34,943
Mike who?

205
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,846
Mike Hanlon.

206
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,815
<i>From Derry.</i>

207
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:48,724
You need to come home.

208
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,198
<i>Eddie,
I keep telling you</i>

209
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:57,733
<i>not to scare me
like this.</i>

210
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,034
<i>And you never
listen to me.</i>

211
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,537
All right. Myra, please.
Not now.

212
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,838
You shouldn't be out there.

213
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,106
Eddie, it's not safe
to drive

214
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,574
when the roads
are slick like this.

215
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,751
Sweetheart,
it stopped raining, like,

216
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,210
three hours ago.
All right?

217
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:10,112
Everything is gonna be fine.

218
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,424
Hey, dickhead!
Flow of traffic mean anything to you?

219
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:12,681
What if you hydroplane?

220
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,451
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

221
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:16,218
It is my job
to assess risk.

222
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,953
So, please trust me
when I tell you

223
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,321
that, statistically speaking,

224
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,066
I am much more likely to
get into an accident

225
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,258
because I am talking
to you on the phone!

226
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,693
All right?
I have to go.

227
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,463
I will talk to you soon.
Goodbye.

228
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,065
Edward Kaspbrak speaking.

229
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:31,544
<i>You didn't say,
"Okay, bye, I love you,"</i>

230
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:32,634
<i>like you usually do.</i>

231
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,902
Listen to me. I can't!

232
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,169
I'm going to be
late to this...

233
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,440
meeting.

234
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,740
<i>Say "I love you," Eddie.</i>

235
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:40,577
Okay, I love you, Mommy.

236
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:42,311
What?

237
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:44,380
Myra. Bye.

238
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,149
Hello? Who's this?

239
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:48,518
<i>It's me. Mike.</i>

240
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,785
Mike who?

241
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,022
<i>Eddie! You okay?</i>

242
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,891
Yeah,
I'm pretty good.

243
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,298
Dude! Dude,
what the fuck?

244
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,067
You were fine, like,
five seconds ago.

245
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,370
Who was it? Who called? Huh?

246
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:09,771
Rich? Rich?
Talk to me.

247
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:11,541
You're on in two minutes.
You good?

248
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,308
'Cause you look not good.

249
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:16,721
- I'm fine.
- You're fine? Okay.

250
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,247
And we're walking.
We're walking.

251
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:19,449
Sixty seconds.

252
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:20,749
Even faster. All right.

253
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,060
Can we get him
a bottle of water, maybe?

254
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,052
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon. Sure, sure.

255
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,588
And a mint.

256
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,189
It is showtime.

257
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:28,900
- I don't think I can do this.
- It's what you do.

258
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,635
- You kill. You're a killer.
- That was fast.

259
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,362
Okay. We are
good to go, and...

260
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,029
Hey! Where we going?
Where we going?

261
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,365
No. This way. Attaboy.

262
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,932
Okay.

263
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,502
All right.
How do I look?

264
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,336
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

265
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,704
Shit.

266
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,206
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

267
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:46,875
<i>please welcome Richie Tozier!</i>

268
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,418
All right.
How are we doing tonight?

269
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:00,490
So, my girlfriend
caught me masturbating

270
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:02,425
to her friend's Facebook page.

271
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,862
And so now
I'm in Masturbators Anonymous.

272
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,765
And I stand up
at the first meeting

273
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:12,602
and I say, "My name
is Richie Trashmouth."

274
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:14,571
<i>- Trashmouth.
- Shut up, Richie.</i>

275
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:16,639
<i>- Fucking perv.
- Shut up, Richie.</i>

276
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:17,806
<i>Pussy!</i>

277
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,775
Trashmouth. Uh...

278
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:23,812
Forgot the joke.

279
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,948
You suck!

280
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,387
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

281
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,088
for letting us
present to you today.

282
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:36,693
Now, this will include
over a million square feet

283
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:39,828
of commercial
and residential space.

284
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,464
State-of-the-art
office towers.

285
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,899
What I'm really looking for
is to understand

286
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,868
how we create even more
retail opportunities.

287
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:50,205
If we put in walls here
and all along here...

288
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:51,873
<i>Lose them.</i>

289
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:56,278
<i>With all due respect,
Mr. Hanscom...</i>

290
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:59,649
Ben, please.
And with all due respect to you,

291
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:01,016
I'm getting claustrophobic

292
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,553
just looking at this model.
Aren't you?

293
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,122
Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.

294
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:08,733
You know what people
want to do in prison?

295
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:10,560
Get out. Right?

296
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:13,529
This should be a place
that brings people together.

297
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:15,465
A meeting ground.

298
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,773
A clubhouse.

299
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,142
<i>And if,</i>

300
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,077
while people are there...

301
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,517
<i>Excuse me
for one second.</i>

302
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,358
<i>- Hello?
- Ben?</i>

303
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,260
<i>It's Mike Hanlon.
From Derry.</i>

304
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,913
Should I just book it?

305
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,649
You're sure you can
get away from work?

306
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,216
It's summer, why not?

307
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,754
Okay, we are
Buenos Aires-bound.

308
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,437
Stanley Uris speaking.

309
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,506
It's Mike.

310
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,674
I'm sorry?

311
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,208
<i>Mike Hanlon.</i>

312
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,344
<i>From Derry.</i>

313
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,014
Mike.

314
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,517
God, sorry. Yes, hi.

315
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,885
I don't
know why I didn't...

316
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,591
How long's it been?

317
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:50,192
A long time.

318
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,261
<i>27 years.</i>

319
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,804
It's come back,
hasn't it?

320
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,071
<i>That's why
you're calling me?</i>

321
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,273
It's starting again, Stan.

322
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,209
<i>Bad things are happening.</i>

323
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,411
Did you call the others?

324
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,747
I mean,
what if they don't come?

325
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,716
We made a promise,
remember?

326
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,317
<i>How soon
can you get here?</i>

327
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,185
Um...

328
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,521
Well, I...

329
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,790
Yeah, I would need to
do a few things...

330
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,492
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

331
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,060
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

332
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:28,382
<i>I'll text you
everything you need.</i>

333
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:30,932
I'll see you soon,
Stan the Man.

334
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:10,406
Do you swear?

335
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,015
I swear, Bill.

336
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,831
<i>You made
a promise, Beverly.</i>

337
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,700
I'm so sorry, Mike.

338
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:13,335
I don't even really remember.

339
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,203
Haven't you ever wondered
why you can't seem

340
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,339
to remember the things
most people should

341
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,109
<i>about where they're from,
about who they are,</i>

342
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,111
<i>why you have that scar
on your hand?</i>

343
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,149
<i>No one else remembered,
either.</i>

344
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:31,621
<i>Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie...</i>

345
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:32,755
<i>Bill.</i>

346
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,222
Bill.

347
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:37,025
You have to come back.

348
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:39,662
You all do.

349
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,265
When?

350
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,315
Whoa.

351
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,918
Are you okay?
What's going on?

352
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:06,121
It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?

353
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:07,623
I didn't want to wake
you, honey.

354
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,058
I know this week's
been really exhausting.

355
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,229
I just got a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

356
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:18,634
I have to go back there.

357
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,603
It's really hard
to explain why.

358
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,671
It's okay.

359
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:26,341
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

360
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:28,477
I trust you.

361
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:29,745
Thank you.

362
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:37,085
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

363
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,758
I heard you.

364
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,562
You said the name Mike.

365
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:47,630
Yes, my friend.

366
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,498
See, there was
a group of us back then,

367
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,743
and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

368
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,670
You know trust is everything
in a relationship.

369
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:58,074
You know
it's everything to me, right?

370
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,108
- I know. This isn't...
- Right?

371
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,110
What?
Like the last time?

372
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,946
I never cheated on you.

373
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,414
You're a bad fucking liar,

374
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,649
Bev.

375
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:09,217
You're not going anywhere,
okay?

376
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,921
I want you to stay right here,

377
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:13,356
and you're gonna show me

378
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:15,758
what it is you're gonna
do with Mike. Okay?

379
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:17,360
You're hurting me, honey.

380
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,495
No one else is
gonna love you like me.

381
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,796
You know that, right?

382
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:23,866
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:31,540
Don't make this
fucking harder!

384
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:32,742
Don't.

385
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,704
You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?

386
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:03,406
Tell me I'm wrong!

387
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,715
Jesus Christ.

388
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:21,349
Boys.

389
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,886
Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.

390
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:25,020
Far enough, Bowers!

391
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:26,321
I'm not done yet.

392
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:27,757
I'm not done.
I'm not fucking done.

393
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,225
- On your knees.
- I can't. No!

394
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,326
I gotta kill them all!
Fuck, fuck!

395
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:32,962
Fucking kill them all!
Stop it!

396
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:36,165
- Cuff this sorry sack of shit!
- Fuck you!

397
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:37,633
Fuck you!

398
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,568
Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrest

399
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,370
for the murder
of Oscar Bowers.

400
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:43,606
Do you understand, dipshit?

401
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,475
You have the right
to an attorney.

402
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,644
You have the right
to remain silent.

403
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:35,424
Bowers!

404
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:38,360
Bowers, calm the fuck down!

405
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,805
Someone needs a little extra
clozapine today, don't they?

406
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,108
Stay in your fucking room.

407
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,004
Hockstetter.

408
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,643
My knife.

409
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:17,459
- Whoa.
- Careful.

410
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,061
This way.

411
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,696
Thanks a lot.

412
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,935
- Hey.
- Oh...

413
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,336
- Mike, you look good.
- Bill.

414
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:29,838
Yup. Whoa.
Hey. How you doing?

415
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:31,640
Bill.

416
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,885
I didn't know
if any of you would...

417
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,020
I mean,
after all this time...

418
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,324
- Yeah.
- But of course you came.

419
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:38,447
You know,
an oath is an oath.

420
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,482
Losers

421
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,185
gotta stick together, right?

422
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,387
The Losers.

423
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:46,789
You remember that.
That's good.

424
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,491
What else do you remember?

425
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:50,859
I am allergic to soy,

426
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,928
anything that has egg in
it, uh, gluten,

427
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:56,932
and if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

428
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,902
Holy shit.

429
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,019
Is there a password
or something?

430
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:20,789
I'm sorry.

431
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,258
The new kid.

432
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:25,527
Ben?

433
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:27,496
Yeah.

434
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:30,566
Oh, my God.

435
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,768
Oh, my God.

436
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:35,037
It's been so long.

437
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:39,975
<i>Stay cool,
Ben from soc class.</i>

438
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:41,844
<i>You too, Beverly.</i>

439
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,190
<i>Hang tough,
new kid on the block.</i>

440
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:46,548
Wow.

441
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,284
You two look amazing.

442
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:51,520
What the fuck
happened to me?

443
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,032
- What's going on, man?
- Hey, man.

444
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:56,091
- It's Richie. Hi.
- Yeah. It's Ben.

445
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,228
- Hi.
- Hey.

446
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:02,874
This meeting
of the Losers' Club

447
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:04,199
has officially begun.

448
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,601
Look at these guys.

449
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:09,938
Ben.

450
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:18,013
So, wait, Eddie,
you got married?

451
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,557
Yeah, why's that so fucking
funny, dickwad?

452
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:20,949
What?
To, like, a woman?

453
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,918
Fuck you, bro.

454
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:24,387
Fuck you!

455
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:25,797
All right. What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?

456
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:27,589
There's no way
Richie's married.

457
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:28,857
No, I got married.

458
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,235
- Richie, I don't believe it.
- When?

459
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:31,627
- Did you not hear this?
- No.

460
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,895
You didn't know
I got married?

461
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,139
- No.
- Yeah, no. Me and your mom

462
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:36,131
are very, very happy
right now.

463
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:37,733
Yeah, very happy.

464
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,160
- He totally fell for it!
- Thanks.

465
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:42,004
Fuck you.

466
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,215
She's very sweet.
Sometimes, she'll put her arm around me,

467
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,275
and she'll whisper to me,
she'll go...

468
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:52,147
We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.

469
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:53,582
Shh.

470
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,751
Hilarious. Hysterical.

471
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,456
Yeah,
it's a nice watch.

472
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:01,957
Wait, let's talk about the
elephant not in the room...

473
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:03,158
Ben.

474
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:04,494
What the fuck, man?

475
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,429
Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.

476
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,256
- Lost a few pounds?
- Yeah, no shit you lost

477
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:09,774
- a few pounds.
- You're, like... You're hot!

478
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,333
That's true.

479
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,877
No, you're like
every Brazilian soccer player

480
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:14,112
wrapped up into one person.
Gorgeous.

481
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,071
Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.

482
00:29:16,138 --> 00:29:17,906
Okay, okay, all right.
Please, come on.

483
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:19,708
Is Stanley coming
or what?

484
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,210
Someone save me.

485
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:24,713
Stan.

486
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:27,584
Stan...

487
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:29,852
Stan Uris.
Stan Urine.

488
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:32,221
Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a fucking pussy.

489
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:33,255
He's not gonna show.

490
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:35,190
Why would
Stanley save you, anyway?

491
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,859
Was I not the one
who basically

492
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,227
performed surgery on you

493
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:39,628
- after Bowers cut you up?
- Yes!

494
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,296
Holy shit!
That's right.

495
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:42,907
Please tell me you ended
up becoming a doctor, Eds.

496
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:46,268
No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.

497
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:47,645
Oh, that sounds
really interesting.

498
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,104
What does that entail?

499
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:51,974
Yeah, so I work for
a big insurance firm and...

500
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:02,552
Fuck you, dude.
Fuck you.

501
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:05,087
Was this job
invented before fun?

502
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:07,856
- That's so not funny.
- It is funny.

503
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:10,426
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

504
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,294
I propose a toast

505
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,297
to the Losers.

506
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:23,105
Let's take our
shirts off and kiss!

507
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:24,907
Oh!

508
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:31,747
- Oh, here we go.
- Thank you.

509
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,383
Thank you.

510
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:36,586
Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?

511
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:38,787
That's...
That's huge.

512
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:41,990
That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.

513
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,393
How long have
you been married?

514
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:44,960
Hey, we saw your movie,

515
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:46,295
- by the way.
- You did?

516
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:47,863
Oh, my God!
It was so good.

517
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,865
- Oh, my God.
- It was so scary.

518
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,233
And the ending sucked?

519
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:55,270
Yeah, it did.
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,439
That's all right.

521
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:03,613
What?

522
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,247
Nothing.
This is just weird.

523
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,315
Yeah.

524
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,050
Just all this,
all these memories,

525
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,286
people that I don't even
remember forgetting.

526
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,692
I mean, it's weird, right?

527
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:17,527
Now that we're all here,

528
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:20,530
everything just comes back
faster and faster.

529
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:21,797
I mean, all of it.

530
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,434
Yeah.

531
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,380
Yeah, you know,
when Mike called me, I threw up.

532
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,737
Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.

533
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,473
I got, like,
sick and I threw up.

534
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,509
I feel fine now.

535
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:35,376
I feel very relieved to be
here with you guys.

536
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:37,112
Why is everybody
looking at me like this?

537
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,947
When Mike called me,
I crashed my car.

538
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:40,082
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

539
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,618
Shit, man,
I hear you.

540
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,519
I mean, my heart
was literally

541
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:46,188
pounding right
out of my chest.

542
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:48,424
- I thought it was only me.
- It was like pure...

543
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:51,260
Fear.

544
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:56,098
It's fear.
What you felt.

545
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,968
Why did we all
feel like that, Mike?

546
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:03,105
You remember something
we don't, don't you, Mike?

547
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:07,744
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

548
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:10,012
The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.

549
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:12,415
But me, I never left.

550
00:32:13,483 --> 00:32:14,484
So, yeah.

551
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:17,353
I remember.

552
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,889
I remember all of it.

553
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:25,127
Pennywise.

554
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:29,197
Oh, the fucking clown.

555
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:31,501
- Oh, shit.
- Pennywise.

556
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,536
Mike, you said you wanted
our help with something.

557
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,137
What was that?

558
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,773
There's an echo
here in Derry

559
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:38,474
that bounces back
every 27 years.

560
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,621
What are you talking about?

561
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:41,143
Hold on.
Listen, listen.

562
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,011
We thought
we stopped It back then.

563
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:44,880
We thought It
was done, but...

564
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,149
Mike.

565
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,251
A week ago, a man,

566
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:51,086
Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.

567
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:53,589
A girl, Lisa Albrecht,
the other night, went missing.

568
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:55,290
All right.

569
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:56,934
There've already been others,
and there will be more.

570
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,236
I don't want to
hear about this shit.

571
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,463
- More death. More pain.
- Calm down.

572
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,631
Let's get another drink.

573
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:03,065
Let him explain.
Let him explain.

574
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,833
Explain it to us, Mike.

575
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,402
That echo,

576
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:09,439
we might have changed It,

577
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:10,740
just like It changed us.

578
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:12,675
But we didn't stop It.

579
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,843
Because It just bounced back.

580
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:19,415
We made an oath.

581
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:22,585
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

582
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,454
To finish It.

583
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,021
For good.

584
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:29,958
Well, that shit got dark fast.

585
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:31,226
Thanks, Mike.

586
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:37,099
My fortune cookie
just says "Could."

587
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,211
They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.

588
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,404
Mine just says "Guess."

589
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:44,774
You wanna throw
that over here?

590
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:48,877
What you got, Mikey?

591
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:55,451
Wait, what?

592
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:57,119
This is
what I'm talking about.

593
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,555
"Guess. Cut.
Not. Could. It."

594
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,089
It's a message.

595
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,024
No,
"Guess it could not cut."

596
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,361
Why would it guess
it could not cut?

597
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:06,496
Cut what?

598
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:07,963
"Guess
it could not cut."

599
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:09,699
"It" goes in front.
There.

600
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:11,133
"It could not guess."

601
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,569
- It couldn't guess.
- "Could it..."

602
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:14,903
No. "Could it not cut."

603
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,515
When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?

604
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:18,374
- Yeah. All right.
- Is that what it means?

605
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:19,801
- Is "It" It?
- Where does this go?

606
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:20,918
That's what
I'm talking about.

607
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,310
It... It could...

608
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,722
I don't know
what it fucking means!

609
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:25,256
You fuck with
the fortune cookies, Mike?

610
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
- No.
- Whoa. Let him speak, man.

611
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,851
This is not me.
This is what It does.

612
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,586
I need my fucking inhaler!

613
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,493
What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?

614
00:34:32,522 --> 00:34:33,965
- This is not fucking funny!
- This is so not funny!

615
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,323
- Beverly?
- This is so not funny.

616
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,321
Why does it say Stanley?

617
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:09,759
Someone else
fucking answer me!

618
00:35:10,893 --> 00:35:12,194
Holy shit.

619
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:14,730
Holy shit.

620
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:25,140
What the fuck
is that, man?

621
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,742
Oh, my God.

622
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,480
Whoa, whoa!

623
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:36,284
Whoa!

624
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,591
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

625
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:43,726
Shit.

626
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,128
Hey! Hey!

627
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,699
That fortune cookie's
looking at me! Shit!

628
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,136
I don't want to be here.
I can't fucking do this.

629
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,239
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

630
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,140
I don't wanna be here!

631
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:00,207
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

632
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,477
Holy shit!

633
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:04,312
Hey! God damn it.

634
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,453
Hey, Eddie!

635
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:29,104
Whoa! Fuck!

636
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,540
It's not real!

637
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,543
This isn't real!
It's not real!

638
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:36,612
It's not real!
It's not real!

639
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:39,180
It's not real!
It's not real!

640
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:42,585
It's not real!
It's not real!

641
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:44,520
Is everything all right?

642
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:49,057
Yeah, yeah.
Could we get the check?

643
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:55,731
That's what
Pennywise does, right?

644
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,476
He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.

645
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,001
Hey, Mike.
Do you have Stan's number?

646
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:00,603
Yeah.

647
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,837
Hey, Richie.

648
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:05,675
How'd you...

649
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:07,075
How'd you know my name?

650
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,210
The fun's just beginning.

651
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,279
Right?

652
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:17,920
What he said, is it...

653
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,555
Listen.
You think this is funny?

654
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:20,690
All right?

655
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:23,258
Think this is
some sort of game, huh?

656
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,527
Well, fuck you,
all right?

657
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:25,895
Rich,
be careful, dude.

658
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:27,697
Fuck you!
I'm not afraid of you!

659
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:30,499
"The fun's just beginning."

660
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,902
The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.

661
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:35,571
- Are those your parents?
- Yeah.

662
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,340
You want a picture?

663
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,509
- You okay, Dean? Come on.
- I think I'm good.

664
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:43,446
Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.

665
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,213
Jesus, Richie.
You don't remember a line

666
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,582
from your own show?

667
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:48,751
I don't write
my own material.

668
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:51,554
I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!

669
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:55,958
Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.

670
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,258
I apologize for calling,

671
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,127
but I'm an old friend
of your husband's.

672
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,796
You lied to us.
That's not okay.

673
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,708
Yeah, first words out of your
mouth should have been like,

674
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:04,643
"Hey, man. You want to come
to Derry and get murdered?"

675
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,968
'Cause then
I would have said no.

676
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,069
Guys.

677
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:08,838
Fucking entrapment, man.

678
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:10,006
<i>Oh...</i>

679
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:13,476
<i>He passed.</i>

680
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:16,344
When did it happen?

681
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:19,180
<i>Yesterday.</i>

682
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:21,884
<i>It was horrible,
the way he died.</i>

683
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:24,487
<i>His wrists.</i>

684
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,822
<i>- In the bathtub.
- In the bathtub.</i>

685
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,662
<i>I'm sorry.
I have to go.</i>

686
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,263
We're all very
sorry, Patty.

687
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,599
<i>Thank you.</i>

688
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:40,936
Stanley.

689
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,807
Pennywise knew.
He knew before we did.

690
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:46,609
We have to stop him.
I have a plan.

691
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:48,356
I got a plan.
Getting the fuck out of Dodge

692
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,680
before this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.

693
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,180
Who's with me?

694
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,487
We made a promise
to each other.

695
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:55,117
Let's un-make the promise.

696
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:56,528
Richie, other people
are gonna die.

697
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:58,688
Other people
die every day, man!

698
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,723
We don't owe
this town shit!

699
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,426
Plus, I just remembered I grew up
here, like, two hours ago.

700
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:06,261
So, I'm fucking leaving.
Fuck this.

701
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,664
I'm sorry, man,
I'm with Richie.

702
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:10,231
- Eds, please.
- Listen.

703
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:13,069
What? We stay,
we die, that's it?

704
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:15,538
I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shit,

705
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,106
and I'm gonna
drive to my home.

706
00:39:17,173 --> 00:39:18,541
I'm sorry, man. Good luck.

707
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,376
No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!

708
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,977
Eddie, wait!

709
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,881
You okay?

710
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:29,461
I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.

711
00:39:29,485 --> 00:39:31,252
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

712
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:35,157
You should have told us,
Mikey.

713
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:37,393
Bill. Please, man.

714
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,627
I'm begging you.
Please.

715
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:40,162
Just listen to me, man.
Please.

716
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,831
What are you gonna say?

717
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:44,934
What could you possibly say

718
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,144
that would make
any kind of a difference?

719
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:48,336
They're all gone.

720
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:50,673
Come on.
Let me show you something.

721
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,275
One thing. And if you want to
leave, you can leave.

722
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:55,902
Just let me show you
this first. Please.

723
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:05,187
Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?

724
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:06,589
My mom swings
better than you!

725
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:07,990
How many times
do I have to...

726
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:10,793
She doesn't even play
baseball! You suck!

727
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,632
Mommy, how much longer?

728
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:19,535
Victoria,
we came to watch the game.

729
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:21,704
We're gonna
watch the game.

730
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,865
Hello, Vicky.

731
00:41:22,932 --> 00:41:25,201
Isn't that what
your friends call you?

732
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:26,468
Vicky?

733
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,371
How did I know that?

734
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:33,008
I guess I must be
your friend, too.

735
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:36,011
If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

736
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,883
You're not my friend.
You're scary.

737
00:41:50,226 --> 00:41:51,760
Why are you crying?

738
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:57,566
People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.

739
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:02,571
I thought if you
couldn't see my face,

740
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:06,041
then maybe you'd
want to be my friend.

741
00:42:07,243 --> 00:42:09,011
Never mind.

742
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:14,650
Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

743
00:42:14,717 --> 00:42:16,552
People make fun
of me, too.

744
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,421
They do?

745
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,524
'Cause of this.

746
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,828
Well, isn't that silly?

747
00:42:26,996 --> 00:42:29,098
That little thing?

748
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:31,834
Why, I can blow
that thing right away.

749
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,270
You could?

750
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:35,671
Oh, yes!

751
00:42:35,738 --> 00:42:38,674
One poof and it'd be gone!

752
00:42:41,543 --> 00:42:45,114
You would have to get close
enough to see my face.

753
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:47,149
I don't know, Vicky.

754
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,952
No, it's okay.
I won't make fun. I promise.

755
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:52,988
Promise promise?

756
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,425
Well, okie-dokie!

757
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,093
Just come on in
a little closer,

758
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,997
and we'll blow it away on
the count of three!

759
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,968
One,

760
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:10,773
two...

761
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:23,018
You're supposed to say three.

762
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:57,186
Holy fuck.

763
00:43:59,088 --> 00:44:00,088
Boo!

764
00:44:13,202 --> 00:44:14,803
Fuck yeah!

765
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:18,774
Hey, Hockstetter.

766
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,276
Let's go!

767
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,896
Let's get our shit and
get the fuck out of here.

768
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:42,365
Did you leave
your stuff here?

769
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:43,732
No, my stuff's
still in the car.

770
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:01,183
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

771
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,019
Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

772
00:45:08,257 --> 00:45:09,958
Bev. Bev.

773
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:11,269
Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's...

774
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:12,294
Stop.

775
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:17,266
She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

776
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:18,867
but, Bev, I saw you.

777
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:22,439
I heard it.
You said it first.

778
00:45:22,505 --> 00:45:24,006
Whatever you guys
are talking about,

779
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:25,817
let's make it happen faster,
all right? We gotta go.

780
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:27,976
<i>Eduardo, andale!
Let's go!</i>

781
00:45:28,043 --> 00:45:30,746
There's something
you're not telling us.

782
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,015
You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.

783
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:35,351
Wait, what?

784
00:45:36,386 --> 00:45:38,787
I can't do this.

785
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:40,390
She knew how Stanley
was going to die,

786
00:45:40,457 --> 00:45:41,690
is that what
she just said?

787
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,892
You can't just
walk away from this.

788
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:45,260
How did you know

789
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:46,328
where he killed himself?

790
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:47,596
Bev.

791
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:49,832
Talk to me.

792
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:51,767
Just talk to me.
Like we used to.

793
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:53,735
Come on,
how did you know?

794
00:45:54,404 --> 00:45:55,838
Because I saw it.

795
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,808
I've seen all of us die.

796
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:02,620
Okay, I just got to
grab my toiletry bag,

797
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:03,679
and then we can go.

798
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,082
What'd I miss?

799
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:22,831
The library?

800
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:24,266
Mmm-hmm.

801
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:28,036
Wow.

802
00:46:28,103 --> 00:46:30,706
Didn't this place
used to be bigger?

803
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:45,120
Yo!
Mike, where are you going?

804
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:12,748
Mike, you live here?

805
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:14,816
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.

806
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:17,853
- You want some water?
- Yeah, sure.

807
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:33,902
You see, memory's the thing.

808
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:35,505
It's the key.

809
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:37,072
It's the key
to everything.

810
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:40,909
If It really does want
us back here,

811
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:42,220
don't you think the
smartest thing we can do

812
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:43,646
is just get the hell
out of Derry?

813
00:47:43,712 --> 00:47:46,281
No, no, no.
It does want us back.

814
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:47,450
Of course It does!

815
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:48,893
But It doesn't know
I know what I know.

816
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:50,052
What do you know?

817
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:51,421
How to kill the shit
out of It!

818
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:54,390
I've read every book.

819
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:56,992
I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,

820
00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:58,661
everybody that would talk to
me, anyway,

821
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:00,862
and that's not a long list.

822
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:02,164
But it wasn't enough.

823
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:04,467
I had to know
how this all started.

824
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:07,236
How It started.

825
00:48:11,773 --> 00:48:13,476
And It started

826
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:18,615
- here.
- Whoa.

827
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:21,817
- What am I looking at, Mike?
- It's an artifact.

828
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:24,219
Early 18th century Shokopiwah.

829
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:26,689
Shoko...
How'd you get it?

830
00:48:26,755 --> 00:48:28,257
I found it, in the...

831
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,727
No, no,
they gave it to me.

832
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:31,860
I stole it.

833
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:33,895
You stole it?

834
00:48:33,962 --> 00:48:36,198
- From Native Americans?
- Uh...

835
00:48:36,265 --> 00:48:39,569
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, it is.

836
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:40,969
They helped me
on my journey.

837
00:48:41,036 --> 00:48:42,804
So beautiful.

838
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:46,041
They showed me things.
A vision.

839
00:48:46,108 --> 00:48:47,677
Ow.

840
00:48:47,744 --> 00:48:49,111
Holy fuck.

841
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:51,213
I feel kind of funky.

842
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,347
Hot.

843
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:53,516
Am I sweating?

844
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,718
I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.

845
00:48:55,784 --> 00:48:57,119
Bill.

846
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,891
They live outside of Derry.

847
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,027
<i>Beyond It's reach.</i>

848
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:07,296
<i>They moved there
many years ago.</i>

849
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:09,965
<i>Their holy man,</i>

850
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:12,368
<i>their holy of holies,</i>

851
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:14,737
<i>he took me in.</i>

852
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,541
<i>Fed me their sacred Maturin.</i>

853
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:22,478
<i>I started to...
To react.</i>

854
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:25,581
All living things
must abide by the laws

855
00:49:25,648 --> 00:49:27,215
of the shape they inhabit.

856
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:35,391
<i>While I sat there,
looking out over the valley,</i>

857
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,560
<i>I saw It arrive.</i>

858
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:45,334
I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.

859
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:46,402
Mike,

860
00:49:48,805 --> 00:49:50,540
did you put something
in my drink?

861
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:53,543
It's, uh...

862
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:54,777
It's a root.

863
00:49:54,843 --> 00:49:56,178
You...

864
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,423
You drugged me?
You drugged me?

865
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:59,281
No, it's a root
with properties.

866
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:01,493
It's just a micro-dose of
what the Shokopiwah gave me...

867
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:02,585
Why would you do that?

868
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:04,487
...to open my eyes.

869
00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:06,154
I don't feel real good.

870
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:09,392
I need you to look,

871
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:10,593
and you'll see.

872
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,562
I don't feel good.

873
00:50:12,628 --> 00:50:14,029
Open your eyes.

874
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:15,931
Open your eyes.

875
00:50:15,997 --> 00:50:18,200
<i>They showed me the past.</i>

876
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,510
<i>Showed me the way
It appeared to them.</i>

877
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:41,824
<i>They showed me
their pain.</i>

878
00:50:45,428 --> 00:50:48,029
<i>They showed me
how to stop It!</i>

879
00:50:57,939 --> 00:50:59,141
It's over.

880
00:50:59,207 --> 00:51:00,710
It's over.
You're okay.

881
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:03,813
You're okay.
Did you see it?

882
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,180
The ritual?

883
00:51:05,247 --> 00:51:06,948
- The Ritual of Chud?
- Yeah, I knew you...

884
00:51:07,015 --> 00:51:09,585
I knew you would see it.

885
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:12,789
I saw the whole fucking
thing, Mike.

886
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:15,157
That's how we kill It.

887
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:23,433
How are we going
to do it?

888
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:26,903
Everybody already
said no.

889
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:28,671
But with you,

890
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,141
they'll listen.

891
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:36,111
This won't work
without all of us.

892
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:42,317
Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

893
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:43,786
Yeah,
'cause I gotta be honest.

894
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:45,813
That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.

895
00:51:46,823 --> 00:51:48,658
Every night since Derry,

896
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,495
I've been having
these nightmares.

897
00:51:54,095 --> 00:51:57,199
People in pain.
People dying.

898
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:58,768
People...

899
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:00,202
So, you have nightmares.

900
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:01,780
I have nightmares.
People, they have nightmares.

901
00:52:01,804 --> 00:52:04,474
But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.

902
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:10,278
I've watched
every single one of us...

903
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:12,548
You've seen
every single one of us what?

904
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:19,622
At the place that
Stanley wound up.

905
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:23,893
That's how we end.

906
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,662
Okay, how come the rest of
us aren't seeing that shit?

907
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,196
I mean,
what makes her so different?

908
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:29,465
The Deadlights.

909
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,201
The Deadlights.

910
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:47,650
She was the only
one of us

911
00:52:47,717 --> 00:52:50,051
that got caught in
the Deadlights that day.

912
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:52,722
We were all
touched by It.

913
00:52:52,788 --> 00:52:54,222
Changed.

914
00:52:54,289 --> 00:52:58,126
Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.

915
00:52:58,193 --> 00:53:00,530
A virus.
You understand.

916
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:01,864
Slowly growing.

917
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:05,200
That virus,
it's been growing for 27 years.

918
00:53:05,267 --> 00:53:07,335
This whole time,
metastasizing.

919
00:53:07,403 --> 00:53:08,843
It just got to Stan
first, because...

920
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:10,006
He was the weakest.

921
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:11,574
Jesus Christ, Rich.

922
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:13,519
Just saying what everyone
else is thinking, man.

923
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:14,977
I mean,
Rich, come on.

924
00:53:15,043 --> 00:53:17,880
What Beverly sees,
it will come to pass.

925
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:19,815
It's what'll happen to
all of us, eventually,

926
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:21,182
unless we stop It.

927
00:53:21,249 --> 00:53:22,809
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

928
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:25,153
The Ritual of Chud.

929
00:53:26,756 --> 00:53:28,323
The Shokopiwah.

930
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:31,594
The first ones who fought
It, they have a saying.

931
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:33,596
"All living things
must abide by

932
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:35,039
"the laws of the
shape they inhabit."

933
00:53:35,063 --> 00:53:36,365
A tribal ritual?

934
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:39,569
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

935
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:41,370
All right,
there's gotta be another way.

936
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:43,472
Okay? This thing comes
back, what, every 27 years?

937
00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:45,551
Let's just kick the can down
the road and do it then.

938
00:53:45,575 --> 00:53:47,208
Wait, we'll be 70 years
old, asshole.

939
00:53:47,275 --> 00:53:49,077
It doesn't
work that way.

940
00:53:50,413 --> 00:53:52,213
None of us make it
another 20 years,

941
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,650
and the way it happens...

942
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:59,889
So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then...

943
00:53:59,956 --> 00:54:01,424
We die.

944
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,558
Horribly.

945
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,360
Yeah, I don't need
the "horribly" part.

946
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:06,094
I didn't say it.
She said it. Not me.

947
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:07,496
All right, guys.
Look.

948
00:54:07,563 --> 00:54:10,366
I've seen
what he's talking about,

949
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:13,536
and it's all true.

950
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,271
It's the only way.

951
00:54:17,673 --> 00:54:19,307
If we want
this ritual to work...

952
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:20,710
We have to remember.

953
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,547
Remember what?

954
00:54:29,385 --> 00:54:31,219
<i>It's better
if I show you.</i>

955
00:54:32,488 --> 00:54:34,255
<i>We don't have
much time.</i>

956
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:38,193
<i>His cycle
will end soon.</i>

957
00:54:40,062 --> 00:54:41,364
<i>And once it does...</i>

958
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,698
<i>We're fucked.</i>

959
00:55:05,421 --> 00:55:07,222
The Barrens.

960
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:08,924
This is where we came.

961
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:11,661
After the rock fight.

962
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:14,195
The clubhouse.

963
00:55:14,997 --> 00:55:16,632
You built that for us.

964
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:18,175
Yeah, the hatch has got to
be around here someplace.

965
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:20,102
You did.
I do remember that!

966
00:55:20,168 --> 00:55:21,737
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!

967
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:24,507
You okay?

968
00:55:27,643 --> 00:55:29,244
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

969
00:55:30,446 --> 00:55:31,781
You haven't changed.

970
00:55:32,848 --> 00:55:34,050
It's a good thing.

971
00:55:38,654 --> 00:55:41,390
You know what?
I actually think the door was more like

972
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,693
around...

973
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:51,199
Found it.

974
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:52,968
I'm okay!

975
00:55:53,703 --> 00:55:54,770
Come down!

976
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:13,288
What the dick is this?

977
00:56:13,355 --> 00:56:14,724
How'd you build it?

978
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:17,693
When did you build it?

979
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,862
Here and there,
I guess.

980
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:21,406
It was already dug
out from something,

981
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,699
so I just had to
reinforce the walls

982
00:56:23,766 --> 00:56:25,401
and get some wood
for the roof door,

983
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,203
and that's pretty much it.

984
00:56:27,268 --> 00:56:29,270
Pretty good for
my first time, huh?

985
00:56:31,707 --> 00:56:33,308
Now,
that's a cool feature.

986
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,553
What happens when
you put your hand

987
00:56:34,577 --> 00:56:36,311
on the other pillar,
professor?

988
00:56:36,378 --> 00:56:38,557
Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes,

989
00:56:38,581 --> 00:56:40,049
why we have permits.

990
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:41,760
This place is a death trap.
You understand that?

991
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:43,464
Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?

992
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,130
Just so you know, I get
hurt, you are liable.

993
00:56:45,154 --> 00:56:47,132
And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?

994
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:48,256
That's a flashlight.

995
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:49,492
What is that,
a horse hitch?

996
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:50,993
When do you have
horses down...

997
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,228
Oh, this is cool.

998
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:53,529
That was like,
three dollars,

999
00:56:53,596 --> 00:56:55,097
so be careful with that, please.

1000
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:56,708
I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?

1001
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:58,367
Yeah, okay,
can you maybe not?

1002
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:00,112
Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?

1003
00:57:00,136 --> 00:57:01,504
Be awesome and have fun

1004
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,405
and celebrate the magic
of the paddle-ball?

1005
00:57:04,272 --> 00:57:05,741
Wow.

1006
00:57:05,808 --> 00:57:07,568
Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.

1007
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,711
- I broke it?
- Yeah,

1008
00:57:08,778 --> 00:57:10,045
you broke it
with your face.

1009
00:57:10,112 --> 00:57:11,847
What?

1010
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:13,594
I'm not putting
my fucking hand down there.

1011
00:57:20,556 --> 00:57:21,991
Oh, man.
That's so cool.

1012
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,994
Oh, my God.

1013
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,464
How do we all not
remember that this was here?

1014
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:30,432
Hey, Losers.

1015
00:57:32,868 --> 00:57:34,737
Time to float.

1016
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,510
- Ahh!
- Fuck, Richie.

1017
00:57:41,577 --> 00:57:43,145
- Dude!
- Remember when he used to say

1018
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:45,748
that shit?
And he'd do that little dance.

1019
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,852
Am I the only one
who remembers this shit?

1020
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:52,988
Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?

1021
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:55,224
All right. Just trying to
add some levity to this shit.

1022
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:56,926
I'll go fuck myself.

1023
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:00,796
It smells so fucking
terrible in here.

1024
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,035
Hey, you guys?

1025
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,906
This says "Stan."

1026
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:13,943
"For the use
of Losers only."

1027
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:17,680
Bill.

1028
00:58:26,755 --> 00:58:28,524
The fuck is this?

1029
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:29,792
So you don't get
spiders stuck

1030
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:31,393
in your hair
when you're down here.

1031
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,220
Stanley, we're not afraid
of fucking spiders.

1032
00:58:36,165 --> 00:58:37,499
I stand corrected.

1033
00:58:38,434 --> 00:58:39,635
That's a first.

1034
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:41,737
Touche.

1035
00:58:41,804 --> 00:58:43,405
Hey, Rich,
your ten minutes are up.

1036
00:58:43,472 --> 00:58:44,874
What are you talking about?

1037
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,618
The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.

1038
00:58:46,642 --> 00:58:48,043
- I don't see any sign.
- Are you

1039
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,879
being this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.

1040
00:58:49,945 --> 00:58:51,723
Why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement?

1041
00:58:51,747 --> 00:58:54,583
And I remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule!

1042
00:58:56,151 --> 00:58:57,453
I can see your vagina!

1043
00:58:57,519 --> 00:58:59,088
Ten minutes each.

1044
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:00,823
Go back in
your dumb little corner!

1045
00:59:01,523 --> 00:59:03,058
I fucked your mom!

1046
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:05,961
No, you didn't.
Take that back!

1047
00:59:06,028 --> 00:59:08,030
You're awfully good at
this, new kid.

1048
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,466
You really think so?

1049
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:14,003
There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor.

1050
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:15,881
Teaches you, like,
everything about architecture.

1051
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:17,139
I was thinking about applying.

1052
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:18,674
I'll do that.

1053
00:59:18,741 --> 00:59:21,543
I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry.

1054
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:23,679
Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.

1055
00:59:23,746 --> 00:59:25,547
What's in Florida, Mike?

1056
00:59:26,615 --> 00:59:28,217
I don't know.

1057
00:59:28,284 --> 00:59:30,061
You know, I guess it's just a
place I always wanted to go.

1058
00:59:30,085 --> 00:59:32,154
Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.

1059
00:59:32,221 --> 00:59:33,756
You already act 80.

1060
00:59:33,822 --> 00:59:35,358
You'd clean up with all the grandmas.

1061
00:59:38,928 --> 00:59:41,063
Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?

1062
00:59:43,332 --> 00:59:44,667
When we're older?

1063
00:59:44,733 --> 00:59:47,002
What?

1064
00:59:47,069 --> 00:59:49,438
Why wouldn't we be?

1065
00:59:49,505 --> 00:59:50,749
Do any of your parents
still hang out

1066
00:59:50,773 --> 00:59:52,253
with their friends
from middle school?

1067
00:59:53,575 --> 00:59:56,545
I mean, things might
be different then.

1068
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,615
We all might be different.

1069
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:04,286
We'll always still be friends.

1070
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:06,622
I don't think that just,
you know,

1071
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:08,824
goes away
because we get older.

1072
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:12,094
Yeah, Stan. Come on.

1073
01:00:14,563 --> 01:00:17,232
You don't have
to be so...

1074
01:00:17,299 --> 01:00:18,701
Sad.

1075
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:24,974
He was old
before his time.

1076
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,009
Yeah.

1077
01:00:27,076 --> 01:00:29,745
I wonder what he was
like all grown up.

1078
01:00:29,812 --> 01:00:31,747
Probably what he
was like as a kid.

1079
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,251
The best.

1080
01:00:37,553 --> 01:00:38,787
Here.

1081
01:00:40,322 --> 01:00:42,691
All right, Mike.
What are we doing here?

1082
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:45,127
The ritual.

1083
01:00:45,194 --> 01:00:47,629
To perform it
requires a sacrifice.

1084
01:00:47,696 --> 01:00:50,265
- Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.
- Wait, what?

1085
01:00:50,332 --> 01:00:52,267
Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.

1086
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,612
I'm 5'9". It's, like,
average height in most of the world.

1087
01:00:54,636 --> 01:00:57,139
It's not that kind of
a sacrifice, guys.

1088
01:00:58,107 --> 01:00:59,241
Mike?

1089
01:01:00,209 --> 01:01:01,944
The past is buried.

1090
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:04,213
But you're gonna have
to dig it up.

1091
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:06,281
Piece by piece.

1092
01:01:06,348 --> 01:01:07,616
And these pieces,

1093
01:01:07,683 --> 01:01:09,284
these artifacts,

1094
01:01:10,387 --> 01:01:11,887
that's why we're here.

1095
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:15,557
They are
what you'll sacrifice.

1096
01:01:16,892 --> 01:01:19,094
And since Stan
isn't here to find his...

1097
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:21,163
I figured we should
all be here together

1098
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,765
to find his artifact.

1099
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:27,036
I think Bill just did that.

1100
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:34,143
Okay, Mike, so where
do we find our tokens?

1101
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:35,954
Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.

1102
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:38,147
This is fucking stupid,
all right?

1103
01:01:38,213 --> 01:01:39,782
Why do we need tokens?
All right?

1104
01:01:39,848 --> 01:01:41,384
We already remember
everything.

1105
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,684
Saving Bev,
defeating It...

1106
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:44,653
I mean,
we're caught up!

1107
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,055
It's not everything.

1108
01:01:47,656 --> 01:01:49,758
We fought.
But what happened after that?

1109
01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:52,795
Before the house
on Neibolt.

1110
01:01:54,096 --> 01:01:55,197
Think.

1111
01:01:57,232 --> 01:02:00,202
We can't
remember, can we?

1112
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:02,304
See, there's more to our story.

1113
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:03,739
What happened that summer.

1114
01:02:04,673 --> 01:02:06,376
And those blank spaces,

1115
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:08,577
like pages torn out of a book.

1116
01:02:08,644 --> 01:02:11,113
That's what
you need to find.

1117
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,881
We need to split up.

1118
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:15,250
You each need to
find your artifact.

1119
01:02:15,317 --> 01:02:17,219
Alone.
That's important.

1120
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:18,287
When you do,

1121
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:21,090
meet me
at the library tonight.

1122
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:23,025
Yeah,
I gotta say,

1123
01:02:23,092 --> 01:02:24,836
statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios,

1124
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,529
we're gonna do much
better as a group.

1125
01:02:26,595 --> 01:02:28,330
Yeah, splitting up
would be dumb, man.

1126
01:02:28,398 --> 01:02:30,232
Okay, we gotta go together.
All right?

1127
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:32,267
We were together that
summer, right?

1128
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:34,770
No.

1129
01:02:34,837 --> 01:02:38,575
Not that
whole summer.

1130
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,175
Take it back.

1131
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:41,743
Bill!

1132
01:02:43,178 --> 01:02:44,913
You're just
a bunch of losers.

1133
01:02:45,515 --> 01:02:46,615
Fuck off!

1134
01:02:46,682 --> 01:02:48,217
- Fucking...
- Stop!

1135
01:02:49,985 --> 01:02:52,688
We were all together
when we hurt It.

1136
01:02:52,754 --> 01:02:54,923
That's why
we're still alive.

1137
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,693
Yeah? Well,
I plan to keep it that way.

1138
01:03:06,802 --> 01:03:07,870
I bet by tomorrow,

1139
01:03:07,936 --> 01:03:09,238
we'll all be
back together.

1140
01:03:11,773 --> 01:03:13,275
I don't think so.

1141
01:03:13,342 --> 01:03:15,411
Well, if we're gonna stop
It, we better be.

1142
01:03:17,346 --> 01:03:18,847
Maybe Richie was right.

1143
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:24,186
Maybe we shouldn't do anything about
It, or maybe we can't.

1144
01:03:24,253 --> 01:03:26,589
Okay, don't let them
get to you.

1145
01:03:26,655 --> 01:03:28,358
It's a little late
for that.

1146
01:03:32,294 --> 01:03:33,729
You should go.

1147
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:37,166
Before your dad sees.

1148
01:04:11,733 --> 01:04:12,935
Yes?

1149
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,771
Sorry. I...

1150
01:04:17,306 --> 01:04:19,341
May I help you?

1151
01:04:19,409 --> 01:04:20,709
I thought I rang Marsh.

1152
01:04:20,776 --> 01:04:22,711
Marsh?

1153
01:04:23,379 --> 01:04:24,846
Alvin Marsh?

1154
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:26,848
My father.

1155
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:29,284
I grew up here.

1156
01:04:35,757 --> 01:04:37,125
Dear,

1157
01:04:37,192 --> 01:04:40,663
it's not for me to
tell you this,

1158
01:04:40,729 --> 01:04:43,065
but your father
passed away.

1159
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:47,836
I'm so sorry.
You didn't know?

1160
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,576
We hadn't spoken
in a while.

1161
01:04:53,643 --> 01:04:55,777
Well, won't you
come in?

1162
01:04:55,844 --> 01:04:57,879
Let me offer you
something to drink.

1163
01:04:57,946 --> 01:05:00,882
No, it's fine.
I have to go.

1164
01:05:00,949 --> 01:05:03,453
It's the least
I can do.

1165
01:05:05,988 --> 01:05:07,789
Sure. Okay.

1166
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:22,304
Is it like you remember?

1167
01:05:22,372 --> 01:05:24,139
Cleaner.

1168
01:05:24,206 --> 01:05:26,376
Well, you feel free
to look around

1169
01:05:26,442 --> 01:05:28,277
while I get
the water boiling.

1170
01:05:28,343 --> 01:05:30,021
Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.

1171
01:05:30,045 --> 01:05:32,848
Don't be so polite.

1172
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:02,911
Today is her birthday.

1173
01:06:07,082 --> 01:06:08,950
I can still smell
her perfume.

1174
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,557
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

1175
01:06:16,626 --> 01:06:18,160
Mama was sick.

1176
01:06:18,226 --> 01:06:21,830
You know that's why
she did what she did.

1177
01:06:21,897 --> 01:06:24,066
She did what she did

1178
01:06:24,132 --> 01:06:28,236
because she was embarrassed
to be your mother.

1179
01:06:29,938 --> 01:06:31,407
You look like her.

1180
01:06:34,076 --> 01:06:36,546
But you are nothing
like her.

1181
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:40,882
Come here.

1182
01:06:43,419 --> 01:06:45,355
I said come here!

1183
01:06:48,056 --> 01:06:49,459
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1184
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,943
You know that I
would never hurt you.

1185
01:07:08,009 --> 01:07:09,277
You know that,
don't you?

1186
01:07:19,054 --> 01:07:21,557
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1187
01:07:21,624 --> 01:07:24,926
You'll always be my little
girl, won't you?

1188
01:07:25,628 --> 01:07:27,095
Always.

1189
01:08:37,132 --> 01:08:39,469
"Your hair is winter fire,

1190
01:08:40,268 --> 01:08:43,038

1191
01:08:43,104 --> 01:08:45,675
<i>"My heart burns
there, too."</i>

1192
01:09:02,725 --> 01:09:05,528
There. I do apologize.

1193
01:09:05,595 --> 01:09:10,933
It gets so very hot
here this time of year.

1194
01:09:10,999 --> 01:09:12,468
It's fine.

1195
01:09:12,535 --> 01:09:16,372
Well, you feel like you
could just about die.

1196
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:19,542
But you know what
they say about Derry.

1197
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:23,746
"No one who dies here
ever really dies."

1198
01:09:36,324 --> 01:09:39,795
But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?

1199
01:09:41,998 --> 01:09:43,966
It's good.
Strange.

1200
01:09:44,032 --> 01:09:45,902
Strange?

1201
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:47,235
Oh, my.

1202
01:09:47,302 --> 01:09:49,705
Strange, how?

1203
01:09:51,407 --> 01:09:53,476
Oh.

1204
01:09:53,543 --> 01:09:56,646
I had some cookies in
the oven before you came.

1205
01:09:56,712 --> 01:09:58,046
You stay right there.

1206
01:09:58,113 --> 01:10:00,282
I really... I shouldn't impose...
I'm gonna...

1207
01:10:00,348 --> 01:10:03,118
No, no, no. I insist.

1208
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:10,626
Mrs. Kersh,
are these your family?

1209
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:12,160
Yes, dear.

1210
01:10:12,227 --> 01:10:16,231
My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.

1211
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:18,534
And he didn't ask
for a handout

1212
01:10:18,601 --> 01:10:21,303
the way that people
come in here these days.

1213
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,972
You know what he did?

1214
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:25,140
What did he do,
Mrs. Kersh?

1215
01:10:25,206 --> 01:10:28,243
My father joined the circus.

1216
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:48,664
I was always
Daddy's little girl.

1217
01:10:49,799 --> 01:10:50,866
What about you?

1218
01:10:54,737 --> 01:10:58,340
Are you still
his little girl, Beverly?

1219
01:11:01,644 --> 01:11:03,178
Are you?

1220
01:11:15,491 --> 01:11:17,460
Mustn't lie
to our father!

1221
01:11:23,866 --> 01:11:25,166
Help!

1222
01:11:25,233 --> 01:11:28,504
Run, run, run.

1223
01:11:28,938 --> 01:11:31,172
Run, run.

1224
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:37,613
You haven't
changed anything yet.

1225
01:11:40,315 --> 01:11:44,520
You haven't
changed their futures.

1226
01:11:47,423 --> 01:11:52,293
You... You haven't
saved any of them.

1227
01:11:56,231 --> 01:11:58,299
Close your eyes, Bev.

1228
01:11:58,868 --> 01:11:59,935
Fuck you!

1229
01:12:00,002 --> 01:12:02,203
If you don't believe,

1230
01:12:05,007 --> 01:12:06,709
close them

1231
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:09,612
and see!

1232
01:13:09,538 --> 01:13:11,006
Come on, you.
Come on.

01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:59,595
You wanna use
that kind of language,

1295
01:18:01,464 --> 01:18:03,098
take it out
in the street.

1296
01:18:03,165 --> 01:18:04,666
I'm sorry.

1297
01:18:04,733 --> 01:18:07,102
Can we just start over and
pretend that I just walked in?

1298
01:18:08,537 --> 01:18:09,905
How can I help you?

1299
01:18:09,972 --> 01:18:12,641
Thank you. Yes.
I want to buy the bike.

1300
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:15,010
Aren't you William
Denbrough, the writer?

1301
01:18:15,077 --> 01:18:16,446
Yeah, that's...

1302
01:18:16,513 --> 01:18:17,746
That's me.

1303
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:20,716
That bike
used to be mine.

1304
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:24,286
Well, it's mine now.

1305
01:18:24,354 --> 01:18:25,554
But you're
the big author.

1306
01:18:25,621 --> 01:18:27,122
You want it,
you can afford it.

1307
01:18:28,358 --> 01:18:30,225
All right.
How much?

1308
01:18:34,296 --> 01:18:35,297
$300.

1309
01:18:36,832 --> 01:18:38,267
You can afford it.

1310
01:18:39,301 --> 01:18:40,537
I'll get it.

1311
01:18:40,602 --> 01:18:43,272
I guess
that's kind of a deal.

1312
01:18:53,749 --> 01:18:55,452
You... You want me to
sign it for you?

1313
01:18:55,518 --> 01:18:56,585
Nah.

1314
01:18:56,652 --> 01:18:58,253
I didn't like the ending.

1315
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,825
Uh...

1316
01:19:03,725 --> 01:19:05,428
Three big ones.

1317
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:07,196
- All yours.
- Uh-huh.

1318
01:19:07,262 --> 01:19:09,298
I don't know
how fast she'll go.

1319
01:19:10,132 --> 01:19:12,101
Been there
a lot of years.

1320
01:19:13,268 --> 01:19:15,237
You know what,
mister?

1321
01:19:16,271 --> 01:19:18,740
She was fast enough
to beat the devil.

1322
01:19:26,215 --> 01:19:27,282
Come on.

1323
01:19:34,123 --> 01:19:36,125
Yeah,
I missed you, too.

1324
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:44,700
Yeah!

1325
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:46,268
Whoo!

1326
01:19:55,512 --> 01:19:58,013
Hi-ho, Silver!

1327
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,948
Away!

1328
01:20:22,671 --> 01:20:24,339
Bye, Billy!

1329
01:20:56,573 --> 01:20:57,873
I know you're
down there.

1330
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,342
I know you
can hear me.

1331
01:21:02,378 --> 01:21:03,979
There's something
I have to know.

1332
01:21:06,416 --> 01:21:08,360
All of the kids in this
town you could have taken,

1333
01:21:08,384 --> 01:21:10,252
why Georgie?

1334
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,893
Say something!

1335
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:21,263
Why him?

1336
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:23,466
Why him?
Why him? Why him?

1337
01:21:43,752 --> 01:21:45,320
Why?

1338
01:21:49,392 --> 01:21:54,229
Because you weren't
there, Billy.

1339
01:22:09,445 --> 01:22:11,213
Billy,
don't leave.

1340
01:22:12,881 --> 01:22:14,082
Hello?

1341
01:22:16,653 --> 01:22:17,886
Billy.

1342
01:22:22,358 --> 01:22:23,426
I'm still here.

1343
01:22:26,663 --> 01:22:28,364
Help me.

1344
01:22:29,465 --> 01:22:30,466
Georgie.

1345
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:37,473
Georgie?

1346
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:40,142
Help me, Billy.

1347
01:22:41,043 --> 01:22:42,745
Take my hand.

1348
01:22:42,811 --> 01:22:44,580
Take my hand.

1349
01:22:44,647 --> 01:22:46,048
I've got you, buddy.
Come on.

1350
01:22:46,114 --> 01:22:47,316
He's coming.

1351
01:22:48,317 --> 01:22:49,686
Take my hand!

1352
01:22:49,752 --> 01:22:51,195
- I got you. Come on.
- Billy, please. He's coming.

1353
01:22:51,219 --> 01:22:52,555
- Take my hand.
- Billy!

1354
01:22:52,622 --> 01:22:54,122
Come on,
take my hand!

1355
01:23:16,646 --> 01:23:18,280
I hate you!

1356
01:23:19,081 --> 01:23:21,384
I hate you.

1357
01:23:21,451 --> 01:23:22,851
Who are
you talking to?

1358
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:25,987
Move, move, move!

1359
01:23:26,054 --> 01:23:28,190
Move! Move!

1360
01:23:28,256 --> 01:23:30,416
You hear voices from that
sewer, you stay away from it.

1361
01:23:32,027 --> 01:23:34,364
You hear voices
from the sewer?

1362
01:23:34,831 --> 01:23:35,964
No.

1363
01:23:36,031 --> 01:23:38,601
No. Just stay away
from that sewer.

1364
01:23:41,804 --> 01:23:43,373
I only hear voices
in the tub.

1365
01:23:45,307 --> 01:23:47,577
You know.
From the drain.

1366
01:23:49,277 --> 01:23:51,179
What kind of voices?

1367
01:23:51,913 --> 01:23:53,148
Kids.

1368
01:23:54,149 --> 01:23:56,486
And other times,
like a...

1369
01:23:56,552 --> 01:23:57,587
Like a clown?

1370
01:24:03,559 --> 01:24:05,060
You listen to me.
You listen good.

1371
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:07,497
You need to
get out of this town.

1372
01:24:07,563 --> 01:24:09,375
All right? Tell your parents.
Make up a reason.

1373
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:11,109
You make up a fucking lie.
I don't care what you do.

1374
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:12,411
Just get out of this town.
Make them

1375
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:14,202
never bring you back.
Do you understand?

1376
01:24:14,269 --> 01:24:16,138
You leave Derry and
you stay out of Derry!

1377
01:24:16,204 --> 01:24:17,473
Do you understand me?

1378
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,940
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1379
01:24:19,007 --> 01:24:21,511
Tell me you understand!

1380
01:24:26,516 --> 01:24:28,818
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1381
01:24:28,885 --> 01:24:30,553
I gotta go.

1382
01:24:33,423 --> 01:24:34,657
Just be careful!

1383
01:25:17,165 --> 01:25:19,100
Come on,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1384
01:25:19,968 --> 01:25:22,137
Wake up, fat-ass.

1385
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:26,542
Fucking loser.

1386
01:25:49,465 --> 01:25:50,900
Whoa.

1387
01:25:50,967 --> 01:25:54,069
Easy. It's just me.

1388
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:56,939
What are you and your little
buddies up to in here?

1389
01:25:57,005 --> 01:26:00,242
Oh. Those guys are
definitely not my buddies.

1390
01:26:00,308 --> 01:26:02,043
No, I meant
your real friends.

1391
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,779
Joey. Jonathan.
Donnie. Danny.

1392
01:26:03,846 --> 01:26:05,414
Oh.

1393
01:26:08,951 --> 01:26:10,520
Are you smoking
in school?

1394
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:13,723
Secret hideout.

1395
01:26:14,757 --> 01:26:16,124
Don't tell anyone.

1396
01:26:24,032 --> 01:26:25,635
You okay, new kid?

1397
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:27,202
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1398
01:26:28,771 --> 01:26:31,306
I guess I'm just worried

1399
01:26:32,909 --> 01:26:37,245
that we're not all gonna be
the same after the fight.

1400
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,382
As long as we can still hang
out, who cares?

1401
01:26:41,316 --> 01:26:42,518
You really mean that?

1402
01:26:45,454 --> 01:26:48,056
Well, yeah,
of course, dummy.

1403
01:26:52,795 --> 01:26:54,129
You and me.

1404
01:26:59,802 --> 01:27:01,202
Oh, my God!

1405
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:04,407
I meant as a friend.

1406
01:27:06,174 --> 01:27:07,719
You actually thought
I could like someone

1407
01:27:07,743 --> 01:27:11,747
as fat and gross and
disgusting like you?

1408
01:27:13,348 --> 01:27:15,116
No matter
how many stupid poems

1409
01:27:15,183 --> 01:27:16,419
you write.

1410
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,294
"Your hair is winter fire.

1411
01:27:32,668 --> 01:27:34,235
"January embers.

1412
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,274
"My heart
burns there, too."

1413
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:06,535
That's not the real Beverly.

1414
01:28:06,602 --> 01:28:09,204
Beverly would never
say anything like that.

1415
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:10,706
She'd never say that.

1416
01:28:25,554 --> 01:28:28,256
Kiss me, fat boy.

1417
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:43,773
Oh, nobody wants to
kiss the fat boy.

1418
01:28:43,839 --> 01:28:45,141
Just leave me alone.

1419
01:28:45,206 --> 01:28:47,043
Alone?

1420
01:28:47,109 --> 01:28:51,147
Oh, you've always
been alone.

1421
01:28:51,212 --> 01:28:54,383
That's not true.
I have real friends.

1422
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:56,385
Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.

1423
01:28:56,452 --> 01:28:58,286
They're my real friends.

1424
01:28:58,354 --> 01:29:02,058
Kiss me as if it
were the last time.

1425
01:29:09,432 --> 01:29:11,266
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

1426
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:29,351
Guys?

1427
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:31,319
Hey.

1428
01:29:32,922 --> 01:29:34,289
Hey.

1429
01:29:35,758 --> 01:29:38,060
So, what did you see
out there?

1430
01:29:38,127 --> 01:29:40,228
Something I wish
I hadn't.

1431
01:29:43,866 --> 01:29:45,266
So, what, we just...

1432
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:52,307
We kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?

1433
01:29:52,374 --> 01:29:54,677
I hope so.
Don't you?

1434
01:29:54,744 --> 01:29:56,979
I don't know.

1435
01:29:57,046 --> 01:29:59,915
I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

1436
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:01,282
Mmm.

1437
01:30:01,349 --> 01:30:02,789
Come on.
There must be something from

1438
01:30:02,818 --> 01:30:04,887
the past that you don't
want to forget again.

1439
01:30:06,756 --> 01:30:08,958
I remember
being scared shitless.

1440
01:30:09,925 --> 01:30:12,361
Cold.

1441
01:30:12,428 --> 01:30:14,897
I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.

1442
01:30:14,964 --> 01:30:17,867
Okay. Please forget
that moment.

1443
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:21,704
I remember this.

1444
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:26,709
I remember the boy
who wrote it for me.

1445
01:30:29,145 --> 01:30:30,946
Not him, so much,

1446
01:30:33,215 --> 01:30:35,417
but how he made me feel.

1447
01:30:38,354 --> 01:30:40,422
And a kiss.

1448
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:49,064
It's still blurry,
but I think the longer we're here,

1449
01:30:49,131 --> 01:30:50,900
the more I can see it.

1450
01:30:50,966 --> 01:30:53,334
The more I can see that moment.

1451
01:30:53,402 --> 01:30:54,837
The more
I can see...

1452
01:30:55,871 --> 01:30:56,872
Bill.

1453
01:30:59,842 --> 01:31:00,976
I think.

1454
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:05,981
I don't know.
Do you remember...

1455
01:31:07,817 --> 01:31:09,985
Bev, um...

1456
01:31:11,487 --> 01:31:13,455
- Move. Move.
- What's wrong?

1457
01:31:13,522 --> 01:31:15,591
I'm leaving.

1458
01:31:15,658 --> 01:31:17,193
What?
You can't leave, man.

1459
01:31:17,259 --> 01:31:18,828
We split,
we all die.

1460
01:31:18,894 --> 01:31:20,934
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.

1461
01:31:21,564 --> 01:31:23,799
Rich. Um...

1462
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:27,469
Rich.

1463
01:31:28,971 --> 01:31:31,607
Hey, kids!
It's Burrow the Beaver!

1464
01:31:31,674 --> 01:31:33,876
Come on down.
It's the last day

1465
01:31:33,943 --> 01:31:36,312
of the festival here
at Canal Days.

1466
01:31:38,113 --> 01:31:39,114
Ahh!

1467
01:31:39,782 --> 01:31:40,883
Asshole!

1468
01:31:54,563 --> 01:31:56,031
Hello?

1469
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:09,511
Can I help you?

1470
01:32:09,578 --> 01:32:11,013
Yeah, I called in...

1471
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,748
I had prescription
called in for Kaspbrak.

1472
01:32:13,215 --> 01:32:14,416
Kaspbrak?

1473
01:32:14,483 --> 01:32:15,684
It's an inhaler.

1474
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:20,322
Uh... Eddie Kaspbrak?

1475
01:32:20,389 --> 01:32:21,957
Mmm-hmm.
That's me.

1476
01:32:23,259 --> 01:32:24,460
I remember you.

1477
01:32:24,894 --> 01:32:26,061
Yeah.

1478
01:32:26,128 --> 01:32:27,696
- Mmm-hmm.
- How's your mom?

1479
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:29,531
Oh, uh...
Well, she died a few years ago.

1480
01:32:29,598 --> 01:32:31,009
It's very sad.
It was from liver cancer.

1481
01:32:31,033 --> 01:32:32,234
What's that?

1482
01:32:32,301 --> 01:32:34,403
- What's what?
- That.

1483
01:32:35,671 --> 01:32:37,439
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

1484
01:32:37,506 --> 01:32:38,741
Okay.

1485
01:32:38,807 --> 01:32:41,076
No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.

1486
01:32:41,143 --> 01:32:43,279
It might not be cancer.

1487
01:32:43,345 --> 01:32:44,546
Cancer?

1488
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:48,450
But it might be.

1489
01:32:48,517 --> 01:32:50,319
You just stay here.

1490
01:32:50,387 --> 01:32:52,355
I'll get you something.

1491
01:32:54,156 --> 01:32:55,457
Okay.

1492
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:07,102
You came here for your
stinky breath pills?

1493
01:33:08,604 --> 01:33:10,806
My breath
is fine.

1494
01:33:10,873 --> 01:33:12,641
Thank you.

1495
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:15,378
That's not
what my dad said.

1496
01:33:15,444 --> 01:33:17,446
He said you have a tumor.

1497
01:33:20,082 --> 01:33:21,384
On your dick.

1498
01:33:22,618 --> 01:33:24,920
But you don't
take pills for...

1499
01:33:26,889 --> 01:33:28,190
Wait, what did
your dad say?

1500
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:30,459
There you go.

1501
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,995
I hope your dick
feels better.

1502
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:36,598
Thank you.

1503
01:33:37,967 --> 01:33:41,236
For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.

1504
01:33:41,303 --> 01:33:43,505
Eddie!

1505
01:33:46,508 --> 01:33:48,610
Eddie bear!

1506
01:33:51,847 --> 01:33:53,148
Mommy?

1507
01:33:59,356 --> 01:34:00,923
Eddie bear!

1508
01:34:04,427 --> 01:34:05,794
Mommy?

1509
01:34:08,697 --> 01:34:11,000
Eddie, come help me!
Quick!

1510
01:34:27,916 --> 01:34:29,452
Eddie!

1511
01:34:29,518 --> 01:34:30,953
Mommy?

1512
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,187
Eddie?

1513
01:34:32,254 --> 01:34:33,655
Eddie, help me!

1514
01:34:33,722 --> 01:34:35,190
Quick, help me!

1515
01:34:35,257 --> 01:34:37,526
Mommy?

1516
01:34:37,593 --> 01:34:39,661
Eddie bear,
come help me, quick!

1517
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:58,614
Eddie?

1518
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,349
The fuck
is she doing here?

1519
01:35:00,417 --> 01:35:01,750
What is taking you
so long?

1520
01:35:01,817 --> 01:35:03,886
I don't know.
Why are you here?

1521
01:35:13,295 --> 01:35:14,863
Mommy!

1522
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:16,632
He's coming!
You gotta get me outta here!

1523
01:35:16,698 --> 01:35:18,333
- Who's coming?
- Eddie.

1524
01:35:20,002 --> 01:35:21,970
What the fuck is that?

1525
01:35:28,911 --> 01:35:30,946
- Mommy.
- You gotta get me outta here.

1526
01:35:31,013 --> 01:35:32,482
He's coming!

1527
01:35:32,549 --> 01:35:34,583
He's gonna kill me!
Eddie!

1528
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:38,087
Help! Please, help me!
He's going to infect me!

1529
01:35:38,153 --> 01:35:40,756
Eddie! He's gonna infect me!
Eddie!

1530
01:35:40,823 --> 01:35:42,791
Help me!

1531
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,362
Help me, Eddie!
He's coming, Eddie!

1532
01:35:46,429 --> 01:35:48,997
Eddie, hurry!

1533
01:35:49,064 --> 01:35:51,200
He's gonna infect me, Eddie!

1534
01:35:53,902 --> 01:35:55,104
Oh, my God!
Eddie!

1535
01:35:56,305 --> 01:35:57,339
Hurry up, Eddie!

1536
01:36:03,413 --> 01:36:04,713
Eddie!

1537
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:14,323
- I can't do it!
- Eddie! Eddie!

1538
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:17,025
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

1539
01:36:17,092 --> 01:36:19,928
I knew you would leave me, Eddie!

1540
01:36:22,164 --> 01:36:23,665
Eddie, help me!

1541
01:36:29,304 --> 01:36:30,440
Eddie!

1542
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:37,746
What's all this shit
doing here?

1543
01:36:37,813 --> 01:36:39,748
Why is that curtain
still here?

1544
01:36:40,349 --> 01:36:41,451
Okay, all right.

1545
01:36:41,518 --> 01:36:43,752
Are you gonna
do this, Eds?

1546
01:36:43,819 --> 01:36:45,020
It's just a memory.

1547
01:36:45,087 --> 01:36:46,523
It's just a memory.
You're fine.

1548
01:36:46,589 --> 01:36:48,924
Deep breath.
Deep breath.

1549
01:36:49,725 --> 01:36:51,994
Okay.
You gonna do it?

1550
01:37:01,538 --> 01:37:03,506
Shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!

1551
01:37:09,678 --> 01:37:11,213
Stop! Stop!

1552
01:37:31,767 --> 01:37:33,068
That's right!

1553
01:37:34,136 --> 01:37:36,038
Fuck you!

1554
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:38,173
Fuck you!

1555
01:37:51,521 --> 01:37:52,955
What the fuck?

1556
01:37:57,594 --> 01:37:59,127
What?

1557
01:37:59,194 --> 01:38:00,896
Push, don't pull,
you moron.

1558
01:38:00,963 --> 01:38:03,165
Oh. Thanks.

1559
01:38:17,346 --> 01:38:19,748
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

1560
01:38:19,815 --> 01:38:21,049
Nothing. I'm fine.

1561
01:38:21,116 --> 01:38:23,118
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

1562
01:38:24,554 --> 01:38:26,064
Hey, how you doing?
Where's everybody else?

1563
01:38:26,088 --> 01:38:27,390
Richie wants to leave.

1564
01:38:27,457 --> 01:38:28,900
Ben's upstairs
trying to get him to stay.

1565
01:38:28,924 --> 01:38:30,859
Eddie's just scared.

1566
01:38:30,926 --> 01:38:32,194
So am I, Bill.

1567
01:38:32,261 --> 01:38:33,730
Aren't you?

1568
01:38:33,795 --> 01:38:35,365
We're all scared.

1569
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:36,566
That's what worries me.

1570
01:38:36,633 --> 01:38:37,966
Because that's
what It wants.

1571
01:38:38,033 --> 01:38:39,334
We can do this,

1572
01:38:39,402 --> 01:38:40,836
but we have
to stick together.

1573
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:40,496
Should we be running?

1574
01:39:40,563 --> 01:39:42,398
This is Derry.
I'm kinda getting used to it.

1575
01:40:11,627 --> 01:40:12,628
What does that mean?

1576
01:40:14,196 --> 01:40:15,864
Shit. It's the kid.

1577
01:40:16,532 --> 01:40:18,033
What?

1578
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,370
It's the kid
from the place.

1579
01:40:20,436 --> 01:40:21,504
The Chinese place.

1580
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:22,638
I saw him
on the way here.

1581
01:40:22,705 --> 01:40:24,540
He lives
at my old house.

1582
01:40:24,607 --> 01:40:26,542
He was going to the fair, and...

1583
01:40:30,011 --> 01:40:31,590
He's going to the fair.
I gotta help him.

1584
01:40:31,614 --> 01:40:33,516
Okay, okay. Listen to me.
We'll go together.

1585
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:35,385
I'm gonna get Richie
and Ben and we'll go.

1586
01:40:35,451 --> 01:40:37,986
There's no time.
I can't let it happen again.

1587
01:40:38,053 --> 01:40:39,573
What happened before
wasn't your fault.

1588
01:40:39,622 --> 01:40:40,690
None of it was.

1589
01:40:40,757 --> 01:40:42,358
I wish
that were true, Bev.

1590
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,363
Bill! Bev!

1591
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:49,632
- What is this? What happened?
- Uh...

1592
01:40:49,699 --> 01:40:50,867
Did Bill just leave?

1593
01:40:50,932 --> 01:40:52,000
I couldn't stop him.

1594
01:40:52,067 --> 01:40:53,369
Everybody's leaving.

1595
01:40:53,436 --> 01:40:54,979
It's all right. It's Bill.
He'll be back.

1596
01:40:55,003 --> 01:40:56,873
He'll come back.

1597
01:40:56,938 --> 01:40:59,141
Well, at least
I got Richie to stay.

1598
01:41:01,711 --> 01:41:03,044
Fuck. Oh.

1599
01:41:19,896 --> 01:41:21,740
Oh. And then the leper,
he threw up all over me.

1600
01:41:21,764 --> 01:41:22,964
"Hey, it's Mike Hanlon.

1601
01:41:23,031 --> 01:41:24,391
"Why don't you
come back to Maine?"

1602
01:41:27,269 --> 01:41:29,037
It's your time, Eddie.

1603
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,774
What?

1604
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:35,711
Why?

1605
01:41:35,778 --> 01:41:37,447
Why did you do that?

1606
01:41:37,513 --> 01:41:40,182
Because he says
it's your time.

1607
01:41:40,248 --> 01:41:42,184
Who says it's my time?

1608
01:41:43,886 --> 01:41:45,788
You know, Eddie.

1609
01:41:45,855 --> 01:41:47,890
You know.

1610
01:41:47,956 --> 01:41:49,892
Time to float.

1611
01:41:56,031 --> 01:41:57,633
Where did he go?

1612
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:03,406
Now give me back
my fucking knife!

1613
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:21,999
You should cut
that fucking mullet.

1614
01:42:22,023 --> 01:42:23,960
It's been, like,
30 years, man.

1615
01:42:24,025 --> 01:42:25,561
Guys!

1616
01:42:27,396 --> 01:42:28,498
Oh, shit.

1617
01:42:30,332 --> 01:42:31,333
Eds?

1618
01:42:33,268 --> 01:42:35,605
Jesus, Eds.
What the hell?

1619
01:42:35,671 --> 01:42:37,272
- Bowers is in my room.
- Oh, my...

1620
01:42:39,675 --> 01:42:41,410
- Is it bad?
- No.

1621
01:42:56,124 --> 01:42:57,727
<i>I'm gonna
carve my whole name</i>

1622
01:42:57,793 --> 01:42:59,094
<i>onto this cottage cheese!</i>

1623
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:07,670
One down!

1624
01:43:08,905 --> 01:43:10,406
Fuck yeah!

1625
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,035
Hey!

1626
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,102
Hey, kid! Kid!

1627
01:43:42,405 --> 01:43:44,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1628
01:43:44,607 --> 01:43:45,608
Hey!

1629
01:43:45,675 --> 01:43:48,044
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Hey!

1630
01:43:48,109 --> 01:43:49,679
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1631
01:43:52,548 --> 01:43:53,616
Fuck.

1632
01:44:03,893 --> 01:44:05,327
Fuck!

1633
01:44:22,445 --> 01:44:24,179
Kid! Hey, kid!

1634
01:44:25,047 --> 01:44:26,348
Fuck.

1635
01:44:26,749 --> 01:44:27,750
Kid?

1636
01:44:32,088 --> 01:44:33,288
Fuck.

1637
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:45,901
Kid?

1638
01:44:46,502 --> 01:44:47,536
Hey!

1639
01:44:56,112 --> 01:44:57,345
Kid.

1640
01:45:03,653 --> 01:45:05,655
Kid? Hey! Hey!

1641
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:07,023
Kid!

1642
01:45:07,089 --> 01:45:08,924
Fuck.

1643
01:45:09,725 --> 01:45:10,793
Shit.

1644
01:45:11,594 --> 01:45:13,062
Hey.

1645
01:45:13,129 --> 01:45:14,195
What are you
doing here?

1646
01:45:14,262 --> 01:45:16,065
Hey.

1647
01:45:16,132 --> 01:45:18,668
No, I'm here to
help.

1648
01:45:18,734 --> 01:45:20,301
Stop following me!

1649
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:22,705
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1650
01:45:29,145 --> 01:45:30,345
No.

1651
01:45:32,615 --> 01:45:33,683
Please.

1652
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,588
Ah.

1653
01:45:39,655 --> 01:45:41,724
I'm here this time.
Just take me.

1654
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:48,731
Son of a bitch!

1655
01:46:00,142 --> 01:46:01,242
Help!

1656
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,716
Help!

1657
01:46:07,817 --> 01:46:08,851
Help!

1658
01:46:35,111 --> 01:46:36,812
I should go back there.
I just fucking

1659
01:46:36,879 --> 01:46:38,757
left them in the lurch, man.
I should go back there.

1660
01:46:38,781 --> 01:46:40,750
What the fuck are you talking about?
Fuck that.

1661
01:46:40,816 --> 01:46:41,884
Fuck them.

1662
01:46:43,284 --> 01:46:45,888
I got dates
in fucking Reno, man.

1663
01:46:55,231 --> 01:46:56,966
<i>Reflecting
on the meaning of</i>

1664
01:46:57,032 --> 01:46:58,333
<i>what I just read,</i>

1665
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,770
<i>the word "Leshanot"
comes up a lot,</i>

1666
01:47:00,836 --> 01:47:03,773
which means "to
change, to transform."

1667
01:47:04,673 --> 01:47:06,742
Which makes sense,
I guess,

1668
01:47:06,809 --> 01:47:09,578
because today I'm
supposed to become a man.

1669
01:47:12,681 --> 01:47:15,017
<i>It's funny, though.</i>

1670
01:47:15,084 --> 01:47:18,420
<i>Everyone, I think,
has some memories</i>

1671
01:47:18,487 --> 01:47:20,356
<i>they're prouder of
than others, right?</i>

1672
01:47:22,124 --> 01:47:25,561
<i>And maybe that's why
change is so scary.</i>

1673
01:47:27,496 --> 01:47:29,999
<i>'Cause the things we wish
we could leave behind...</i>

1674
01:47:31,467 --> 01:47:33,869
- Good morning, Mike.
- How you doing?

1675
01:47:33,936 --> 01:47:35,838
<i>...the whispers we wish
we could silence...</i>

1676
01:47:35,905 --> 01:47:39,375
His pa is the one.
The one that set that fire.

1677
01:47:41,443 --> 01:47:44,713
<i>...the nightmares we most
want to wake up from,</i>

1678
01:47:47,149 --> 01:47:50,052
<i>the memories we wish
we could change...</i>

1679
01:47:54,623 --> 01:47:57,593
<i>...the secrets we feel
like we have to keep</i>

1680
01:47:59,662 --> 01:48:02,431
<i>are the hardest to
walk away from.</i>

1681
01:48:06,302 --> 01:48:08,838
<i>The good stuff?</i>

1682
01:48:08,904 --> 01:48:13,108
<i>The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest?</i>

1683
01:48:13,175 --> 01:48:16,779
<i>Those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose.</i>

1684
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,517
<i>Maybe I don't want to forget.</i>

1685
01:48:23,552 --> 01:48:26,856
Maybe if that's what
today is all about,

1686
01:48:29,124 --> 01:48:31,026
forget it, right?

1687
01:48:31,093 --> 01:48:32,728
Thank you, Stanley.

1688
01:48:32,795 --> 01:48:34,463
Today, I'm supposed
to become a man,

1689
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:37,533
but I don't feel
any different.

1690
01:48:39,501 --> 01:48:41,604
I know I'm a loser.

1691
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:43,873
And no matter what,

1692
01:48:43,939 --> 01:48:45,875
I always fucking will be.

1693
01:49:06,262 --> 01:49:08,130
Thanks for showing up,
Stanley.

1694
01:49:49,672 --> 01:49:52,041
<i>Mike! Help!</i>

1695
01:49:53,842 --> 01:49:55,010
Help us!

1696
01:49:55,077 --> 01:49:58,280
- Please, Mikey, get help!
- Help us!

1697
01:49:58,347 --> 01:50:01,418
Please, Mikey,
get help!

1698
01:50:01,483 --> 01:50:02,785
Mikey!

1699
01:50:28,110 --> 01:50:30,913
You should
have burned, Mike.

1700
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,988
Just like
your druggie parents.

1701
01:50:39,054 --> 01:50:41,790
Can you see them yet?

1702
01:50:41,857 --> 01:50:43,192
Crisping?

1703
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,929
Like fried fucking...

1704
01:50:58,941 --> 01:51:01,610
I guess you could say
that was long overdue.

1705
01:51:01,677 --> 01:51:03,512
Get it?
'Cause we're in a library.

1706
01:51:03,579 --> 01:51:05,147
No.

1707
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:07,616
Oh...

1708
01:51:10,119 --> 01:51:11,354
Mike?

1709
01:51:11,421 --> 01:51:13,622
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, my God.

1710
01:51:19,661 --> 01:51:21,263
Are you all right?

1711
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:23,330
No, I'm not all right.
I just fucking killed a guy.

1712
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:25,701
I was talking to Mike.

1713
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:29,271
Where's Bill?

1714
01:51:34,943 --> 01:51:36,278
Bill, we're all
at the library.

1715
01:51:36,345 --> 01:51:37,780
Where are you at?

1716
01:51:37,846 --> 01:51:40,082
He took a little
kid, Mike.

1717
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:43,719
He took a little kid right
in fucking front of me.

1718
01:51:43,786 --> 01:51:45,554
No, no, no, no, no.
Just, just...

1719
01:51:45,621 --> 01:51:47,021
Look, just come here
to the library.

1720
01:51:47,056 --> 01:51:48,557
We can talk about
the plan.

1721
01:51:48,624 --> 01:51:50,726
<i>- I'm gonna go kill It.
- No, no, no.</i>

1722
01:51:50,793 --> 01:51:54,596
I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.

1723
01:51:54,663 --> 01:51:56,031
<i>Bill! Bill!</i>

1724
01:52:00,803 --> 01:52:02,439
He's going
to fight It alone.

1725
01:52:02,505 --> 01:52:04,873
- What?
- Alone.

1726
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:06,208
It's about the group.

1727
01:52:06,275 --> 01:52:07,752
The ritual doesn't work
without the group.

1728
01:52:07,776 --> 01:52:09,344
Doing it together
is why it'd work.

1729
01:52:13,282 --> 01:52:15,717
Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?

1730
01:52:15,784 --> 01:52:17,619
If he really wanted
to kill Pennywise,

1731
01:52:17,686 --> 01:52:19,221
there's only one place
he'll go.

1732
01:52:19,288 --> 01:52:21,168
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

1733
01:52:21,223 --> 01:52:23,659
Oh, we're not gonna like
this, are we?

1734
01:52:24,626 --> 01:52:26,095
Fuck.

1735
01:52:55,558 --> 01:52:57,427
Bill!

1736
01:52:57,494 --> 01:52:59,529
No, no,
you guys, no!

1737
01:52:59,596 --> 01:53:01,598
I started all this.

1738
01:53:01,663 --> 01:53:04,434
It's my fault that
you're all here.

1739
01:53:04,501 --> 01:53:07,936
This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside you all.

1740
01:53:08,003 --> 01:53:09,972
It started growing
the day

1741
01:53:10,038 --> 01:53:11,574
that I made you go
down to the Barrens

1742
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:16,278
because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

1743
01:53:17,713 --> 01:53:19,181
Now, I'm gonna
go in there,

1744
01:53:19,248 --> 01:53:20,916
and I don't know
what's gonna happen,

1745
01:53:20,983 --> 01:53:23,785
but I can't ask you
to do this.

1746
01:53:25,854 --> 01:53:27,189
Well,

1747
01:53:27,256 --> 01:53:29,425
we're not asking you,
either.

1748
01:53:29,492 --> 01:53:30,527
- Bev...
- We didn't

1749
01:53:30,593 --> 01:53:32,127
do it alone
then, Bill,

1750
01:53:32,194 --> 01:53:34,830
so we're not gonna
do this alone now.

1751
01:53:34,897 --> 01:53:37,132
Losers stick together.

1752
01:53:42,704 --> 01:53:45,375
So, does somebody
want to say something?

1753
01:53:47,209 --> 01:53:50,345
Richie said it best
when we were here last.

1754
01:53:50,413 --> 01:53:51,780
I did?

1755
01:53:53,348 --> 01:53:56,151
- "I don't want to die"?
- Not that.

1756
01:53:56,218 --> 01:53:57,986
"You're lucky we're
not measuring dicks"?

1757
01:53:59,455 --> 01:54:00,956
No.

1758
01:54:02,991 --> 01:54:04,427
"Let's kill
this fucking clown"?

1759
01:54:08,364 --> 01:54:11,033
Let's kill this
fucking clown.

1760
01:54:35,857 --> 01:54:37,326
Hmm.

1761
01:54:37,393 --> 01:54:39,073
Well, I love what he's
done with the place.

1762
01:54:39,728 --> 01:54:40,862
Beep-beep, Richie.

1763
01:54:40,929 --> 01:54:42,197
All right.

1764
01:55:01,216 --> 01:55:03,318
Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?

1765
01:55:09,291 --> 01:55:11,026
Ben?

1766
01:55:11,093 --> 01:55:13,328
No, no!
Hey, hey! Ben!

1767
01:55:13,396 --> 01:55:14,497
Ben!

1768
01:55:14,564 --> 01:55:15,565
Ben? What's wrong?

1769
01:55:17,899 --> 01:55:20,102
- Ben!
- Okay. All right.

1770
01:55:20,168 --> 01:55:21,803
Ben!

1771
01:55:27,943 --> 01:55:29,945
Okay, that can't
be good, right?

1772
01:55:31,381 --> 01:55:33,115
Help! Hey!

1773
01:55:39,756 --> 01:55:40,956
Ugh!

1774
01:55:47,630 --> 01:55:48,830
It's Stan.

1775
01:55:52,602 --> 01:55:53,802
It can't
be real.

1776
01:55:55,438 --> 01:55:57,473
Oh!

1777
01:55:59,007 --> 01:56:00,443
Oh, God.

1778
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:01,577
Shit.

1779
01:56:09,818 --> 01:56:12,254
I'd still be alive if
it wasn't for you, Bill.

1780
01:56:13,389 --> 01:56:14,390
No.

1781
01:56:18,795 --> 01:56:20,128
Beverly!

1782
01:56:42,050 --> 01:56:44,252
Richie, what's happening to me?

1783
01:57:04,072 --> 01:57:06,642
You gotta be
fucking kidding.

1784
01:57:11,947 --> 01:57:14,249
Fuck!

1785
01:57:15,685 --> 01:57:19,054
Oh, God damn it, get it away from me.
Oh, God!

1786
01:57:22,023 --> 01:57:24,059
Whoa, whoa!

1787
01:57:34,737 --> 01:57:35,872
Eddie.

1788
01:57:35,937 --> 01:57:38,073
Hey. Are you okay?

1789
01:57:38,574 --> 01:57:39,575
I'm...

1790
01:57:44,781 --> 01:57:46,014
Oh, there he is.

1791
01:57:49,752 --> 01:57:50,952
Get it off of me!

1792
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,623
Get it off of me!

1793
01:57:55,591 --> 01:57:56,591
Richie!

1794
01:57:56,592 --> 01:57:58,895
- Richie!
- Richie! Hey!

1795
01:58:01,564 --> 01:58:03,231
- Get it off of me!
- I wanna go home.

1796
01:58:04,801 --> 01:58:06,301
Get the knife!

1797
01:58:06,369 --> 01:58:08,136
God damn it, Eddie,
get the knife!

1798
01:58:08,203 --> 01:58:10,706
Bill! Get it off of me, Bill!
Quick!

1799
01:58:13,208 --> 01:58:14,976
Eddie, get the knife!

1800
01:58:15,611 --> 01:58:17,179
Ahh! Fuck!

1801
01:58:37,867 --> 01:58:38,868
What?

1802
01:58:50,746 --> 01:58:52,548
Is everybody okay?

1803
01:58:52,615 --> 01:58:55,418
You all right?

1804
01:58:55,485 --> 01:58:57,787
He could have
fucking died, man.

1805
01:58:57,854 --> 01:58:58,987
You know that, right?

1806
01:58:59,054 --> 01:59:00,623
I can't see.

1807
01:59:00,690 --> 01:59:04,326
Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.

1808
01:59:04,393 --> 01:59:06,929
You want Richie, too?
You want Richie, too?

1809
01:59:06,995 --> 01:59:09,264
I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.

1810
01:59:14,002 --> 01:59:16,004
Please don't
be mad, Bill.

1811
01:59:19,909 --> 01:59:21,777
I was just scared.

1812
01:59:24,279 --> 01:59:27,215
That's what
he wants, right?

1813
01:59:29,685 --> 01:59:31,621
Don't give it to him.

1814
01:59:44,165 --> 01:59:45,768
A lot of memories, huh?

1815
01:59:48,036 --> 01:59:49,337
All bad.

1816
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:03,285
Oh, man.

1817
02:00:04,787 --> 02:00:06,756
Blech. Gray water.

1818
02:00:45,061 --> 02:00:46,495
Shit. This is it.

1819
02:00:48,464 --> 02:00:49,699
This is where
it happened.

1820
02:01:05,581 --> 02:01:07,148
No, no, no.

1821
02:01:07,215 --> 02:01:08,784
No. Ugh!

1822
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,661
Bevvie.

1823
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:29,270
Bev, what is it?

1824
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:36,112
I thought
I heard something.

1825
02:01:38,648 --> 02:01:40,016
Bev!

1826
02:01:40,082 --> 02:01:41,450
Time to sink!

1827
02:01:45,153 --> 02:01:46,555
Bev!

1828
02:01:48,457 --> 02:01:49,692
Guys.

1829
02:01:52,895 --> 02:01:54,563
Okay, guys.
Come on.

1830
02:01:59,035 --> 02:02:00,803
Hey, guys.

1831
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:02,972
Guys, come on.
Please, come on.

1832
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:04,840
I don't want to walk
out of here alone.

1833
02:02:08,678 --> 02:02:10,413
You okay?

1834
02:02:10,479 --> 02:02:12,682
I feel like crying.

1835
02:02:12,748 --> 02:02:15,551
Mike. Where do we go from here?

1836
02:02:22,591 --> 02:02:24,325
In the depths
is where It crept.

1837
02:02:24,393 --> 02:02:26,194
In the beneath,
to find belief.

1838
02:02:26,261 --> 02:02:27,563
In the depths
is where It crept.

1839
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:29,098
In the beneath,
to find belief.

1840
02:02:29,165 --> 02:02:30,633
Is he okay?

1841
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:32,611
I think at this point,
that's a relative question.

1842
02:02:32,635 --> 02:02:34,403
What's on
the other side?

1843
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:36,839
I don't know.
No one does.

1844
02:02:39,675 --> 02:02:40,876
Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

1845
02:02:41,711 --> 02:02:42,712
Mike.

1846
02:02:47,817 --> 02:02:49,852
- Mike, don't.
- All right.

1847
02:02:49,919 --> 02:02:51,219
- See you down there.
- Mike!

1848
02:02:51,286 --> 02:02:52,521
Wait!

1849
02:02:58,694 --> 02:03:00,963
- Stay together.
- Okay.

1850
02:03:04,066 --> 02:03:05,300
You guys,
I can't do it.

1851
02:03:07,403 --> 02:03:09,538
I can't.
You saw what happened up there.

1852
02:03:09,605 --> 02:03:11,674
I was gonna
let you die.

1853
02:03:11,741 --> 02:03:13,642
I just fucking
froze up.

1854
02:03:13,709 --> 02:03:15,745
If you let me go
down there with you,

1855
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:17,345
I'm gonna get us all killed.

1856
02:03:17,413 --> 02:03:18,514
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.

1857
02:03:18,581 --> 02:03:19,582
- Give me that.
- Richie.

1858
02:03:19,648 --> 02:03:21,282
Let go,
you little turd.

1859
02:03:21,349 --> 02:03:23,119
Just let me get...

1860
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:25,721
- I got it.
- Stop.

1861
02:03:26,455 --> 02:03:27,990
Listen to me.

1862
02:03:28,057 --> 02:03:29,625
You had a moment.
Fine.

1863
02:03:29,692 --> 02:03:32,495
But who killed a psychotic
clown before he was 14?

1864
02:03:34,029 --> 02:03:35,164
Me.

1865
02:03:35,231 --> 02:03:36,341
Who stabbed Bowers
with a knife

1866
02:03:36,365 --> 02:03:37,633
he pulled out
of his own face?

1867
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,968
Also me.

1868
02:03:39,034 --> 02:03:40,874
Who married a woman 10
times his own body mass?

1869
02:03:43,304 --> 02:03:44,907
- Me.
- Yeah.

1870
02:03:47,943 --> 02:03:50,345
You're braver
than you think.

1871
02:03:50,412 --> 02:03:51,614
All right.
Thanks, Rich.

1872
02:03:52,548 --> 02:03:54,583
- Ow.
- Sorry.

1873
02:03:57,086 --> 02:03:58,220
Hey.
Here.

1874
02:03:58,286 --> 02:03:59,355
Take it.

1875
02:03:59,421 --> 02:04:01,322
It kills monsters.

1876
02:04:03,324 --> 02:04:05,561
- Does it?
- Yeah.

1877
02:04:05,628 --> 02:04:07,295
If you believe
it does.

1878
02:04:08,864 --> 02:04:09,932
Thanks, Bev.

1879
02:04:28,150 --> 02:04:29,285
You guys good?

1880
02:04:29,351 --> 02:04:30,619
Yeah.

1881
02:04:35,157 --> 02:04:36,258
Can you get through that?

1882
02:04:36,324 --> 02:04:37,404
It's the only way.
This way.

1883
02:04:37,459 --> 02:04:38,994
It's in here!

1884
02:04:42,932 --> 02:04:44,066
Through here.

1885
02:04:44,133 --> 02:04:46,035
It's tight,
but we can get through.

1886
02:05:01,584 --> 02:05:03,452
This is where It hid.

1887
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:28,377
So, all this has been under
Derry, like, forever?

1888
02:05:28,444 --> 02:05:30,279
Not forever.

1889
02:05:30,346 --> 02:05:31,780
Just a few million years.

1890
02:06:07,716 --> 02:06:10,819
It can only be
attacked in its true form.

1891
02:06:10,886 --> 02:06:12,006
The ritual
will show us that.

1892
02:06:12,054 --> 02:06:13,656
And what is
It's true form?

1893
02:06:13,722 --> 02:06:15,557
I hope it's a puppy.

1894
02:06:15,624 --> 02:06:17,927
Like a Pomeranian or...

1895
02:06:17,993 --> 02:06:18,994
I'll shut up.

1896
02:06:19,995 --> 02:06:21,030
It's light.

1897
02:06:24,867 --> 02:06:26,936
A light that must be
snuffed out by darkness.

1898
02:06:40,115 --> 02:06:41,116
Your artifacts.

1899
02:06:42,718 --> 02:06:44,887
Place them in the fire.

1900
02:06:44,954 --> 02:06:47,022
The past must
burn with the present.

1901
02:06:55,464 --> 02:06:58,734
This is the boat
that I built

1902
02:07:01,170 --> 02:07:02,671
with Georgie.

1903
02:07:07,276 --> 02:07:09,545
It's my inhaler.

1904
02:07:14,783 --> 02:07:15,951
Come on, dude.

1905
02:07:18,554 --> 02:07:20,789
Something that
I wish I had held on to.

1906
02:07:26,463 --> 02:07:29,366
This is a page
from my yearbook.

1907
02:07:29,432 --> 02:07:32,034
That only
one person signed.

1908
02:07:32,101 --> 02:07:35,438
I probably should
have forgotten it,

1909
02:07:35,504 --> 02:07:37,973
but I couldn't,
because I kept it in my wallet

1910
02:07:39,775 --> 02:07:41,276
for 27 years.

1911
02:07:47,583 --> 02:07:49,183
This is a token
from the Capitol Theater.

1912
02:07:49,218 --> 02:07:50,895
- You brought an actual token?
- Yeah, man.

1913
02:07:50,919 --> 02:07:52,597
That's what we were supposed to
do, asshole.

1914
02:07:52,621 --> 02:07:54,265
Do you have any idea how long
that's gonna take to burn?

1915
02:07:54,289 --> 02:07:55,724
Yeah, but so is your
inhaler, dude.

1916
02:07:55,791 --> 02:07:57,427
Guys, come on.

1917
02:07:57,494 --> 02:07:59,494
All the toxic fumes and
the plastic and shit, so...

1918
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:03,232
Look closely, Bev.

1919
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:06,602
You see it?

1920
02:08:06,668 --> 02:08:08,103
That's where
you hit Bowers.

1921
02:08:10,105 --> 02:08:11,106
The rock fight.

1922
02:08:13,609 --> 02:08:15,544
The day these bonds were forged.

1923
02:08:16,513 --> 02:08:18,013
That's not
gonna burn, either.

1924
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:24,753
Oh, wait.

1925
02:08:28,157 --> 02:08:29,658
Couldn't forget
about Stan,

1926
02:08:30,393 --> 02:08:31,660
again.

1927
02:08:36,632 --> 02:08:38,267
Okay.

1928
02:08:38,333 --> 02:08:39,334
Grab hands.

1929
02:08:41,036 --> 02:08:42,071
Come on.

1930
02:08:49,678 --> 02:08:51,780
The Ritual of Chud.

1931
02:08:51,847 --> 02:08:54,650
It's a battle of wills.

1932
02:08:54,716 --> 02:08:57,186
The first step
was our reunion.

1933
02:08:57,252 --> 02:09:01,056
The second was
the gathering of tokens.

1934
02:09:02,925 --> 02:09:04,960
This is the final step.

1935
02:09:07,796 --> 02:09:08,997
What the...

1936
02:09:17,739 --> 02:09:19,375
Fuck is that?

1937
02:09:19,442 --> 02:09:20,809
- Don't look at them!
- Are those

1938
02:09:20,876 --> 02:09:22,512
- the Deadlights?
- Don't look at it!

1939
02:09:22,579 --> 02:09:24,213
Okay.

1940
02:09:24,279 --> 02:09:25,957
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark. Say it!

1941
02:09:25,981 --> 02:09:27,584
- Say what?
- Say it!

1942
02:09:27,683 --> 02:09:29,118
Turn light
into dark.

1943
02:09:31,086 --> 02:09:32,721
Turn light into dark.

1944
02:09:32,788 --> 02:09:34,289
Turn light
into dark.

1945
02:09:34,357 --> 02:09:35,991
Turn light
into dark.

1946
02:09:37,594 --> 02:09:39,862
Turn light into dark.

1947
02:09:52,442 --> 02:09:54,810
Turn light into dark.
Mike, what's happening, man?

1948
02:09:54,877 --> 02:09:56,513
Keep chanting!

1949
02:09:56,579 --> 02:09:57,779
Turn light
into dark.

1950
02:10:00,949 --> 02:10:03,419
Turn light
into dark!

1951
02:10:03,486 --> 02:10:05,355
Turn light
into dark!

1952
02:10:05,421 --> 02:10:08,157
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

1953
02:10:08,223 --> 02:10:09,858
- Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

1954
02:10:09,925 --> 02:10:11,561
- Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

1955
02:10:15,532 --> 02:10:17,467
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

1956
02:10:17,534 --> 02:10:18,614
Is it working?
Did we do it?

1957
02:10:22,304 --> 02:10:23,739
What is this?
Is this part of it?

1958
02:10:23,805 --> 02:10:25,316
Mike, is this supposed
to be happening?

1959
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:26,619
- What? No, no, no.
- Keep chanting!

1960
02:10:26,643 --> 02:10:28,110
- What?
- Keep chanting!

1961
02:10:28,177 --> 02:10:29,479
Turn light
into dark!

1962
02:10:29,546 --> 02:10:31,013
- Turn light into dark.
- Come on!

1963
02:10:31,079 --> 02:10:33,682
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark.

1964
02:10:33,749 --> 02:10:35,050
Whoa!

1965
02:10:39,522 --> 02:10:40,822
Hey! Hey!

1966
02:10:45,294 --> 02:10:46,429
Shit!

1967
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:52,167
Move, move!
Whoa!

1968
02:11:00,342 --> 02:11:02,277
Bev. Bev.

1969
02:11:03,413 --> 02:11:05,948
- Richie.
- Are you okay?

1970
02:11:06,014 --> 02:11:07,483
- I can't hear shit.
- He's okay.

1971
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:09,110
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No, no, no.

1972
02:11:09,151 --> 02:11:10,687
- Wait, where's Mike?
- Mike!

1973
02:11:10,752 --> 02:11:11,954
Mike!

1974
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:14,022
- I'm here!
- Hey, guys.

1975
02:11:14,089 --> 02:11:16,091
Did we do it? Did we do it?
Yeah? Did we do it?

1976
02:11:16,158 --> 02:11:17,726
We put the
tokens in the thing.

1977
02:11:17,793 --> 02:11:18,860
That's good, right?

1978
02:11:18,927 --> 02:11:20,697
We did it, right?

1979
02:11:22,699 --> 02:11:24,132
Shit! Shit!

1980
02:11:24,199 --> 02:11:27,269
Oh, did it work, Mikey?
Did it work?

1981
02:11:29,338 --> 02:11:32,874
Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

1982
02:11:34,109 --> 02:11:35,877
Tell them
it's all just a...

1983
02:11:35,944 --> 02:11:37,746
What's the word, Eds?

1984
02:11:37,813 --> 02:11:39,081
Gazebo?

1985
02:11:40,349 --> 02:11:41,984
Mike, what's
he talking about?

1986
02:11:42,050 --> 02:11:43,218
Mikey?

1987
02:11:44,753 --> 02:11:49,525
Oh, Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, did you?

1988
02:11:51,059 --> 02:11:52,495
Didn't want them to know

1989
02:11:52,562 --> 02:11:55,498
what actually happened to
the poor Shokopiwah?

1990
02:11:55,565 --> 02:11:57,833
<i>Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.</i>

1991
02:12:06,341 --> 02:12:08,611
Fuck, Mikey.
You lied to us, again?

1992
02:12:08,678 --> 02:12:11,813
No,
but they didn't believe!

1993
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:13,157
They didn't believe
they could kill It!

1994
02:12:13,181 --> 02:12:14,560
That's why it didn't
work back then!

1995
02:12:14,584 --> 02:12:15,864
Are you fucking kidding
me, Mike?

1996
02:12:15,917 --> 02:12:17,453
- We hurt him.
- Fuck!

1997
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:19,054
Fuck you, Mikey.

1998
02:12:19,121 --> 02:12:22,157
I needed something,
anything, for us to remember.

1999
02:12:22,224 --> 02:12:23,726
Anything for us
to believe!

2000
02:12:23,792 --> 02:12:24,893
- God damn it!
- Fuck!

2001
02:12:33,902 --> 02:12:34,970
The Deadlights!

2002
02:12:35,037 --> 02:12:36,406
Don't look at them!

2003
02:12:41,444 --> 02:12:43,045
For 27 years,

2004
02:12:43,979 --> 02:12:47,450
I dreamt of you.

2005
02:12:48,685 --> 02:12:50,986
I craved you.

2006
02:12:51,053 --> 02:12:53,656
Oh, I've
missed you!

2007
02:12:53,723 --> 02:12:55,658
Mike! Move back!

2008
02:12:55,725 --> 02:12:59,828
Waiting for
this very moment.

2009
02:12:59,895 --> 02:13:02,398
Mikey!
You gotta move, Mikey!

2010
02:13:02,465 --> 02:13:04,242
- Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
- Mike, come on, man!

2011
02:13:04,266 --> 02:13:05,635
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

2012
02:13:05,702 --> 02:13:08,103
Time to float!

2013
02:13:10,707 --> 02:13:12,240
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry.

2014
02:13:14,410 --> 02:13:16,111
Mike, come on, get up!
Get him up!

2015
02:13:16,178 --> 02:13:18,013
- Go, go!
- Run!

2016
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:20,416
- Oh, shit!
- Run! Go, go, go!

2017
02:13:30,727 --> 02:13:32,160
Go, go, go!

2018
02:13:36,366 --> 02:13:37,400
Go!

2019
02:13:50,613 --> 02:13:52,114
Go, go, go!

2020
02:13:56,452 --> 02:13:57,453
Where'd he go?

2021
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:58,840
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out.

2022
02:14:20,342 --> 02:14:21,977
- Oh, shit!
- Can he see us?

2023
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:24,346
Oh, my God!

2024
02:14:24,414 --> 02:14:25,481
Shit.

2025
02:14:26,281 --> 02:14:27,949
Oh, shit.

2026
02:14:28,016 --> 02:14:30,118
Holy shit!
Holy shit! Run!

2027
02:14:30,185 --> 02:14:31,687
Oh, shit!

2028
02:14:33,356 --> 02:14:34,956
Shit.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2029
02:14:41,129 --> 02:14:42,330
We're trapped.

2030
02:14:42,398 --> 02:14:44,166
Where do we go?

2031
02:15:13,161 --> 02:15:15,163
- God damn it!
- Uh...

2032
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:17,433
All right.
"Not Scary At All." All right?

2033
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:18,434
No, no, no.

2034
02:15:18,435 --> 02:15:20,101
Wait. Why?

2035
02:15:20,168 --> 02:15:21,938
They're flipped.
He's fucking with us.

2036
02:15:22,003 --> 02:15:24,172
- Are you sure? Positive?
- Trust me.

2037
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:25,541
- Yes!
- Okay.

2038
02:15:30,145 --> 02:15:31,380
Where's my shoe?

2039
02:15:44,259 --> 02:15:46,562
What the fuck?
You told me to trust you!

2040
02:15:48,898 --> 02:15:50,065
He's not
fucking with us.

2041
02:15:50,131 --> 02:15:51,309
Let's go to
"Not Scary At All."

2042
02:15:51,333 --> 02:15:52,635
Okay.

2043
02:15:58,541 --> 02:16:00,543
It's all right.
Let's go.

2044
02:16:02,812 --> 02:16:04,447
Oh, shit.

2045
02:16:06,616 --> 02:16:08,417
No way am I falling
for this shit again.

2046
02:16:08,484 --> 02:16:10,920
Oh, yeah.
That thing's a fucking monster.

2047
02:16:10,987 --> 02:16:12,220
Richie, make it sit.

2048
02:16:12,287 --> 02:16:14,790
I know your moves,
you little bitch.

2049
02:16:17,426 --> 02:16:18,427
Rich?

2050
02:16:19,127 --> 02:16:20,463
It's gone, man.

2051
02:16:20,530 --> 02:16:21,931
- Yeah. Wait.
- Oh. Okay.

2052
02:16:21,998 --> 02:16:23,265
Okay.

2053
02:16:24,767 --> 02:16:25,768
Sit.

2054
02:16:26,936 --> 02:16:28,437
He did it.

2055
02:16:28,504 --> 02:16:29,872
Oh, that's cute.

2056
02:16:29,939 --> 02:16:31,717
- That's a good boy.
- That's actually super cute.

2057
02:16:31,741 --> 02:16:33,041
That's a good boy.

2058
02:16:33,108 --> 02:16:34,477
- Are you a good boy?
- Good boy.

2059
02:16:39,515 --> 02:16:40,783
Shit!

2060
02:16:40,850 --> 02:16:42,752
Yo, next time,
we just go with regular "Scary."

2061
02:16:42,818 --> 02:16:44,152
Next time?

2062
02:16:56,666 --> 02:16:59,635
I lost it,
Billy.

2063
02:17:01,404 --> 02:17:03,673
It just floated off.

2064
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:09,110
I'm not mad at you.

2065
02:17:10,513 --> 02:17:13,248
It's your fault what
happened, isn't it?

2066
02:17:15,585 --> 02:17:19,622
You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

2067
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:22,223
No.

2068
02:17:24,125 --> 02:17:27,128
I just pretended

2069
02:17:27,195 --> 02:17:29,599
because I didn't want to
play with you.

2070
02:17:33,035 --> 02:17:34,870
I just didn't want to.

2071
02:17:36,072 --> 02:17:38,674
You lied and I died.

2072
02:17:39,442 --> 02:17:43,045
You lied and I died.

2073
02:17:43,111 --> 02:17:46,082
You lied and I died!

2074
02:17:46,147 --> 02:17:48,951
You lied and I died!

2075
02:17:49,018 --> 02:17:50,920
You lied and I died!

2076
02:17:50,987 --> 02:17:53,254
It happened because of
me, Georgie. Me.

2077
02:17:53,321 --> 02:17:54,824
No, no, no.
It was...

2078
02:18:03,032 --> 02:18:04,100
Lied and died!

2079
02:18:04,165 --> 02:18:06,068
Lied and died!

2080
02:18:06,134 --> 02:18:07,903
Lied and died!

2081
02:18:07,970 --> 02:18:10,039
You lied and I died!

2082
02:18:42,405 --> 02:18:45,340
You in there, you little shit?
I can smell you.

2083
02:18:45,408 --> 02:18:47,843
You smell
just like Lois Lane.

2084
02:18:48,878 --> 02:18:50,046
Here's Johnny!

2085
02:19:30,251 --> 02:19:31,921
All that success,

2086
02:19:31,987 --> 02:19:33,389
all those sit-ups,

2087
02:19:33,456 --> 02:19:35,290
but deep down,
still just

2088
02:19:35,357 --> 02:19:38,293
a little fat, fat,
fatty loser...

2089
02:19:39,729 --> 02:19:43,331
...who always knew
he would die alone.

2090
02:19:49,972 --> 02:19:52,108
- Slut!
- Bev!

2091
02:19:55,077 --> 02:19:56,311
Beverly!

2092
02:19:56,912 --> 02:19:58,346
Bevvie.

2093
02:19:58,414 --> 02:20:01,217
Just open up the door for
me, okay?

2094
02:20:01,282 --> 02:20:03,219
Beverly,
can you hear me?

2095
02:20:04,954 --> 02:20:07,255
Come to Daddy, now.

2096
02:20:07,322 --> 02:20:08,591
Bev, don't listen!

2097
02:20:10,291 --> 02:20:11,494
Bev!

2098
02:20:12,728 --> 02:20:14,730
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2099
02:20:16,565 --> 02:20:18,400
Beverly, I love you!

2100
02:20:19,368 --> 02:20:20,636
Ben!

2101
02:20:20,703 --> 02:20:23,105
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2102
02:20:23,172 --> 02:20:25,040
Are you still
my little girl?

2103
02:20:25,107 --> 02:20:26,142
Not anymore!

2104
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:31,346
You little...

2105
02:20:31,413 --> 02:20:33,314
"Your hair
is winter fire.

2106
02:20:34,784 --> 02:20:36,952
"January embers.

2107
02:20:37,019 --> 02:20:38,821
"My heart...

2108
02:20:41,824 --> 02:20:42,858
"My heart..."

2109
02:20:44,894 --> 02:20:45,895
No!

2110
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:53,569
Ben!

2111
02:20:53,636 --> 02:20:56,005
Ben!

2112
02:21:18,127 --> 02:21:19,428
"January embers."

2113
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:23,065
"My heart
burns there, too."

2114
02:21:24,934 --> 02:21:26,402
It was you.

2115
02:21:41,349 --> 02:21:42,952
We deserve to die.

2116
02:21:43,018 --> 02:21:44,486
No.

2117
02:21:44,553 --> 02:21:48,691
You were the best big brother
there ever was.

2118
02:21:48,757 --> 02:21:51,527
No! We killed
our little brother!

2119
02:21:53,062 --> 02:21:54,830
He loved you.

2120
02:21:54,897 --> 02:21:56,532
And just because
you didn't want to play

2121
02:21:56,599 --> 02:21:57,867
on a rainy day,

2122
02:21:59,034 --> 02:22:00,703
just one time,

2123
02:22:03,072 --> 02:22:05,074
that does not
make it our fault.

2124
02:22:16,552 --> 02:22:18,053
And it never,

2125
02:22:20,789 --> 02:22:22,424
ever...

2126
02:22:25,127 --> 02:22:26,128
...did.

2127
02:23:00,429 --> 02:23:01,630
Bill.

2128
02:23:03,198 --> 02:23:04,533
Miss me?

2129
02:23:06,035 --> 02:23:07,803
I know what you are.

2130
02:23:07,870 --> 02:23:09,171
That's why
I'm not afraid.

2131
02:23:15,811 --> 02:23:17,980
Well, I know
what you are.

2132
02:23:20,049 --> 02:23:21,583
A madman.

2133
02:23:28,057 --> 02:23:29,058
Hey, fuckface!

2134
02:23:36,031 --> 02:23:37,700
You wanna play
Truth or Dare?

2135
02:23:37,766 --> 02:23:39,034
Here's a truth.

2136
02:23:39,101 --> 02:23:40,703
You're a sloppy bitch!

2137
02:23:40,769 --> 02:23:41,870
Yeah, that's right!

2138
02:23:41,937 --> 02:23:44,506
Let's dance!
Yippee-ki-yay...

2139
02:24:17,706 --> 02:24:19,975
This kills monsters.

2140
02:24:20,843 --> 02:24:22,845
If you believe it does.

2141
02:24:22,911 --> 02:24:24,713
If you believe it does.

2142
02:24:25,514 --> 02:24:27,016
If you believe it does.

2143
02:24:27,916 --> 02:24:29,618
If you believe it does.

2144
02:24:31,687 --> 02:24:34,656
Beep-beep,
motherfucker!

2145
02:24:53,443 --> 02:24:54,511
Holy shit!

2146
02:24:59,048 --> 02:25:00,149
Rich!

2147
02:25:00,215 --> 02:25:01,583
Oh, Rich!

2148
02:25:01,650 --> 02:25:03,285
Hey, Rich,
wake up!

2149
02:25:03,353 --> 02:25:04,620
Hey.

2150
02:25:04,686 --> 02:25:06,255
Yeah, yeah! There he is, buddy!

2151
02:25:06,321 --> 02:25:07,756
Hey, Richie, listen!

2152
02:25:07,823 --> 02:25:09,158
I think
I got him, man!

2153
02:25:11,494 --> 02:25:12,828
I think I killed It!

2154
02:25:12,895 --> 02:25:14,397
I did! I think
I killed It for real!

2155
02:25:19,301 --> 02:25:20,302
Eddie.

2156
02:25:23,072 --> 02:25:24,073
Richie.

2157
02:25:27,276 --> 02:25:28,378
Richie.

2158
02:25:33,248 --> 02:25:34,249
No!

2159
02:25:35,584 --> 02:25:36,819
Eddie.

2160
02:25:38,287 --> 02:25:40,589
Uh-oh!

2161
02:25:42,291 --> 02:25:43,292
No!

2162
02:25:56,539 --> 02:25:57,806
Eddie!

2163
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:05,647
Eds!

2164
02:26:06,516 --> 02:26:08,717
- Eds! Eds!
- Eddie!

2165
02:26:08,784 --> 02:26:10,252
Eds,
come on, man.

2166
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:13,021
Be careful!
Be careful!

2167
02:26:23,665 --> 02:26:26,001
Come out
and play, Losers!

2168
02:26:27,504 --> 02:26:28,971
He's hurt.
He's hurt really bad.

2169
02:26:29,037 --> 02:26:30,339
We gotta
get him out of here.

2170
02:26:30,406 --> 02:26:31,926
How are we supposed
to do that, Richie?

2171
02:26:35,644 --> 02:26:37,246
I almost killed It.

2172
02:26:38,548 --> 02:26:39,748
The leper.

2173
02:26:40,649 --> 02:26:42,818
My hands
around his throat.

2174
02:26:42,885 --> 02:26:45,087
And I could feel
him choking.

2175
02:26:46,456 --> 02:26:48,257
I made him small.

2176
02:26:53,596 --> 02:26:54,830
He seemed so weak.

2177
02:26:57,666 --> 02:26:59,268
He seemed so weak.

2178
02:27:00,235 --> 02:27:01,270
The Shokopiwah.

2179
02:27:02,905 --> 02:27:04,206
All living things
must abide by

2180
02:27:04,273 --> 02:27:05,774
the laws of the shape
they inhabit.

2181
02:27:06,775 --> 02:27:08,310
Guys!

2182
02:27:08,378 --> 02:27:10,446
There's a passageway.
Through here.

2183
02:27:11,747 --> 02:27:13,849
The tunnel.

2184
02:27:13,916 --> 02:27:15,851
Pennywise has to
make himself small

2185
02:27:15,918 --> 02:27:19,021
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

2186
02:27:19,087 --> 02:27:20,466
Okay, so, if we can get back
there, we can

2187
02:27:20,490 --> 02:27:22,625
- force him down to size.
- Yeah.

2188
02:27:22,691 --> 02:27:25,894
We make him small.
Small enough so we can kill him.

2189
02:27:28,063 --> 02:27:31,434
I can smell
the stink of your fear!

2190
02:27:32,968 --> 02:27:34,970
- Let's go! Go!
- Come on! Come on!

2191
02:27:35,037 --> 02:27:36,838
It's tight. It's tight.
Be careful!

2192
02:27:51,053 --> 02:27:54,357
I need a little rest.
Oh, thanks.

2193
02:27:55,525 --> 02:27:57,125
Hey.

2194
02:27:57,192 --> 02:27:58,227
Hey, Richie?

2195
02:27:58,293 --> 02:27:59,562
I gotta
tell you something.

2196
02:27:59,629 --> 02:28:01,230
What?
What's up, buddy?

2197
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,401
I fucked your mother.

2198
02:28:10,005 --> 02:28:11,840
Losers out!

2199
02:28:14,644 --> 02:28:15,844
Go. Go!

2200
02:28:26,922 --> 02:28:28,123
Gotcha!

2201
02:28:29,425 --> 02:28:30,993
Whoa!

2202
02:28:31,059 --> 02:28:34,397
You filthy little children.

2203
02:28:36,131 --> 02:28:37,610
You got a plan B, man?
What the hell do we do now?

2204
02:28:37,634 --> 02:28:39,301
You die.
That's what you do.

2205
02:28:40,335 --> 02:28:41,504
Mike?

2206
02:28:44,106 --> 02:28:45,986
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

2207
02:28:48,176 --> 02:28:49,143
Oh!

2208
02:28:49,144 --> 02:28:51,280
Make him
believe that he is.

2209
02:28:51,346 --> 02:28:53,215
- What?
- Make him believe that he is.

2210
02:28:53,282 --> 02:28:56,818
Oh? Me?
Small?

2211
02:28:57,853 --> 02:29:00,922
I am
the Eater of Worlds.

2212
02:29:00,989 --> 02:29:02,190
Not to us,
you're not.

2213
02:29:04,926 --> 02:29:06,328
You're just a clown.

2214
02:29:11,634 --> 02:29:13,001
You're a weak old woman.

2215
02:29:15,837 --> 02:29:18,508
The Eater of Worlds.

2216
02:29:18,574 --> 02:29:19,941
A headless boy!

2217
02:29:21,843 --> 02:29:23,345
Impostor!

2218
02:29:24,813 --> 02:29:26,281
You're a mimic!

2219
02:29:28,551 --> 02:29:30,185
A mimic!

2220
02:29:30,252 --> 02:29:33,088
You're a fucking bully!

2221
02:29:33,155 --> 02:29:34,823
You're just
a fucking clown!

2222
02:29:34,890 --> 02:29:36,024
Eater of Worlds!

2223
02:29:36,091 --> 02:29:38,126
A clown!
A dumb fucking clown!

2224
02:29:39,328 --> 02:29:40,996
Clown!

2225
02:29:42,598 --> 02:29:44,634
A leper!

2226
02:29:44,701 --> 02:29:46,536
You're a clown!

2227
02:29:46,602 --> 02:29:47,869
You're a clown!

2228
02:29:47,936 --> 02:29:49,071
A painting!

2229
02:29:49,137 --> 02:29:50,440
You're a clown!

2230
02:29:50,506 --> 02:29:51,840
I'm not afraid
of you anymore!

2231
02:29:51,907 --> 02:29:54,777
A motherfucking
stupid mummy!

2232
02:29:54,843 --> 02:29:56,044
You're a clown!

2233
02:29:57,480 --> 02:29:59,314
Clown! Clown!

2234
02:30:01,116 --> 02:30:03,453
- Clown!
- Clown!

2235
02:30:03,519 --> 02:30:05,688
You're a fucking clown!

2236
02:30:05,755 --> 02:30:07,122
You're a clown!

2237
02:30:07,189 --> 02:30:09,324
- A stupid mummy!
- Clown!

2238
02:30:10,693 --> 02:30:12,027
Clown, motherfucker!

2239
02:30:12,094 --> 02:30:15,365
I am the Eater of Worlds!

2240
02:30:19,935 --> 02:30:21,937
Clown!

2241
02:30:22,003 --> 02:30:24,607
- Clown!
- You're just a clown! Clown!

2242
02:30:24,674 --> 02:30:27,377
- I am the Eater of Worlds!
- A clown!

2243
02:30:27,443 --> 02:30:28,910
Whoa!

2244
02:30:28,977 --> 02:30:31,079
A clown! A clown!

2245
02:30:33,148 --> 02:30:35,485
No one's
afraid of you.

2246
02:30:35,551 --> 02:30:36,985
No one's scared of you.

2247
02:30:38,588 --> 02:30:40,889
Clown! Clown!

2248
02:30:41,890 --> 02:30:45,595
Clown. Clown. Clown.

2249
02:30:48,029 --> 02:30:50,198
- Clown.
- Clown.

2250
02:30:52,402 --> 02:30:54,336
A clown.

2251
02:30:54,404 --> 02:30:56,439
With a scared,
beating heart.

2252
02:31:44,019 --> 02:31:46,389
Look at you.

2253
02:31:47,790 --> 02:31:52,628
You're all grown up.

2254
02:32:55,992 --> 02:32:57,225
Eddie. Eddie.

2255
02:33:00,897 --> 02:33:03,064
Eddie.
We got Pennywise, man.

2256
02:33:05,166 --> 02:33:06,369
Eddie?

2257
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:20,383
Richie.

2258
02:33:21,017 --> 02:33:22,250
He's gone.

2259
02:33:22,317 --> 02:33:23,753
He's all right.
No, he's just hurt.

2260
02:33:23,819 --> 02:33:26,154
We gotta get him outta here.
He's hurt. Ben.

2261
02:33:26,221 --> 02:33:27,599
Bill, he's okay.
We gotta get him outta here.

2262
02:33:27,623 --> 02:33:28,624
Bev.

2263
02:33:29,725 --> 02:33:31,192
Richie.

2264
02:33:33,930 --> 02:33:35,230
What?

2265
02:33:35,297 --> 02:33:37,232
Honey, he's dead.

2266
02:33:40,603 --> 02:33:42,838
We have to go. Come on.
Come on, Richie.

2267
02:33:42,905 --> 02:33:44,473
We gotta go.

2268
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:46,241
Come on, buddy. Come on.

2269
02:33:50,111 --> 02:33:51,346
Let him go, man.
Let him go.

2270
02:33:51,414 --> 02:33:53,348
Got it.

2271
02:33:53,416 --> 02:33:56,151
We can still help him, guys!
We can still help him!

2272
02:33:57,152 --> 02:33:58,320
Go! Go! Get up!

2273
02:33:58,387 --> 02:34:00,590
Guys, we can
still help him!

2274
02:34:12,300 --> 02:34:14,370
No! Eddie!

2275
02:34:14,804 --> 02:34:16,271
Eddie!

2276
02:34:20,576 --> 02:34:21,777
Come on!
Let's go!

2277
02:34:26,816 --> 02:34:27,817
Come on! Let's go!

2278
02:34:30,753 --> 02:34:31,754
Move, move!

2279
02:34:38,126 --> 02:34:39,962
- Move, move!
- Run!

2280
02:34:40,029 --> 02:34:41,229
Run!

2281
02:34:55,210 --> 02:34:56,646
- Eddie!
- No, no, no!

2282
02:34:56,712 --> 02:34:57,713
Eddie!

2283
02:34:59,448 --> 02:35:01,817
We gotta get in there
and get him!

2284
02:35:01,884 --> 02:35:03,552
He's still in there!

2285
02:35:14,195 --> 02:35:15,564
Eddie!

2286
02:35:16,065 --> 02:35:17,366
Eddie!

2287
02:36:17,026 --> 02:36:18,461
You know what?

2288
02:36:18,527 --> 02:36:21,697
Eddie would have
hated this, guys.

2289
02:36:21,764 --> 02:36:24,867
What? Cleaning ourselves
in dirty water?

2290
02:36:24,934 --> 02:36:26,402
Yeah.

2291
02:36:26,469 --> 02:36:29,205
He'd be telling us we'd get
streptococcal something.

2292
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:31,440
Yeah.

2293
02:36:31,507 --> 02:36:32,984
But he would have
made us laugh, though.

2294
02:36:33,008 --> 02:36:34,543
Oh, yeah.

2295
02:36:34,610 --> 02:36:36,579
He'd be
looking out for us.

2296
02:36:38,313 --> 02:36:40,348
The way he always was.

2297
02:36:44,220 --> 02:36:46,021
Ain't that right, Richie?

2298
02:36:48,591 --> 02:36:49,592
Hey.

2299
02:37:20,288 --> 02:37:21,490
Oh.

2300
02:37:22,224 --> 02:37:23,324
Thank you.

2301
02:37:23,392 --> 02:37:24,994
I don't have
my glasses on,

2302
02:37:25,060 --> 02:37:27,020
so I don't know who you people
are, but thank you.

2303
02:37:29,297 --> 02:37:30,933
I legit
can't find my glasses.

2304
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:32,234
You're serious?

2305
02:37:32,300 --> 02:37:33,636
- Glasses?
- Go that way.

2306
02:37:33,702 --> 02:37:35,303
Around here somewhere?

2307
02:37:41,110 --> 02:37:42,788
- I can't see them.
- Oh, I see them. Right there.

2308
02:37:42,812 --> 02:37:45,147
- Where?
- Look. Right...

2309
02:37:45,214 --> 02:37:46,615
If you just go, like...

2310
02:37:47,383 --> 02:37:48,818
Anybody have any luck?

2311
02:38:50,946 --> 02:38:51,947
Hey, guys.

2312
02:38:53,816 --> 02:38:54,884
Look.

2313
02:39:04,493 --> 02:39:06,028
Nothing lasts forever.

2314
02:39:26,448 --> 02:39:28,150
I can't go home
like this, guys.

2315
02:39:29,018 --> 02:39:30,185
My mom will kill me.

2316
02:39:30,252 --> 02:39:32,621
Dude, you've been gone
for 24 straight hours.

2317
02:39:32,688 --> 02:39:34,890
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

2318
02:39:34,957 --> 02:39:37,526
Also, that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers.

2319
02:39:37,593 --> 02:39:38,794
Oh, shut up, Richie.

2320
02:39:38,861 --> 02:39:40,301
Okay, first of all,
my mom's slippers

2321
02:39:40,363 --> 02:39:42,264
smell like potpourri, asshole.

2322
02:39:42,331 --> 02:39:43,799
No, they don't.

2323
02:39:43,866 --> 02:39:45,210
Yes, they do.
And, also, how would you know

2324
02:39:45,234 --> 02:39:46,835
what they smell like
in the first place?

2325
02:39:46,902 --> 02:39:47,970
Can we
just keep it quiet,

2326
02:39:48,037 --> 02:39:49,705
please,
until we get home?

2327
02:39:49,772 --> 02:39:51,182
"Potpourri" is
literally a French word

2328
02:39:51,206 --> 02:39:52,875
meaning "rotten pot."

2329
02:39:52,942 --> 02:39:54,622
I knew there
was something rotten about it.

2330
02:40:15,597 --> 02:40:17,866
<i>- Mike?
- Hey.</i>

2331
02:40:17,933 --> 02:40:20,135
I just thought
I'd check up on you.

2332
02:40:20,202 --> 02:40:21,546
You know,
just to see if you learned

2333
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:22,871
how to finish
a book for once.

2334
02:40:25,107 --> 02:40:26,909
I just finished
the first chapter.

2335
02:40:28,644 --> 02:40:32,181
And I think I actually know
where I'm going this time.

2336
02:40:32,915 --> 02:40:33,915
Good.

2337
02:40:33,916 --> 02:40:35,918
Say, can I ask
you a question?

2338
02:40:35,985 --> 02:40:37,152
<i>Sure.</i>

2339
02:40:38,687 --> 02:40:40,589
Why do you think
we're not forgetting?

2340
02:40:41,490 --> 02:40:43,393
You know, like last time?

2341
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:45,194
Maybe 'cause It's dead.

2342
02:40:48,398 --> 02:40:49,765
Or maybe 'cause
we have more

2343
02:40:49,832 --> 02:40:52,301
we want to remember
than we want to forget.

2344
02:40:52,369 --> 02:40:53,902
I like that one.

2345
02:40:57,773 --> 02:40:58,883
You decide
what you want to do?

2346
02:40:58,907 --> 02:41:00,242
<i>About leaving Derry?</i>

2347
02:41:00,309 --> 02:41:02,678
Man, I've been in this cell
for 27 years.

2348
02:41:04,046 --> 02:41:05,614
Just seeing
what It wanted me to.

2349
02:41:09,386 --> 02:41:12,121
I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

2350
02:41:13,255 --> 02:41:15,425
<i>Go get it, Mikey.</i>

2351
02:41:15,492 --> 02:41:17,059
Oh, did you get the letter?

2352
02:41:18,293 --> 02:41:19,595
What letter?

2353
02:41:19,661 --> 02:41:22,432
You'll know
when you see it.

2354
02:41:22,499 --> 02:41:24,566
Well, hold on.
I just got the mail.

2355
02:41:24,633 --> 02:41:26,135
<i>We all got one.</i>

2356
02:41:28,737 --> 02:41:29,972
Patricia Uris?

2357
02:41:30,939 --> 02:41:31,940
<i>Just...</i>

2358
02:41:33,108 --> 02:41:34,444
Just read it.

2359
02:41:34,511 --> 02:41:35,611
Okay.

2360
02:41:35,677 --> 02:41:37,913
<i>And call me.
Anytime.</i>

2361
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:39,982
I will.

2362
02:41:40,049 --> 02:41:41,116
<i>And, Bill,</i>

2363
02:41:46,755 --> 02:41:49,024
I love you, man.

2364
02:41:49,091 --> 02:41:50,826
I love you, too.

2365
02:41:50,893 --> 02:41:53,262
<i>All right.
See you around.</i>

2366
02:42:20,423 --> 02:42:22,791
<i>Dear Losers,</i>

2367
02:42:22,858 --> 02:42:24,827
<i>I know what this must seem like,</i>

2368
02:42:24,893 --> 02:42:26,695
<i>but this isn't
a suicide note.</i>

2369
02:42:28,465 --> 02:42:32,167
<i>You're probably wondering
why I did what I did.</i>

2370
02:42:32,234 --> 02:42:35,270
<i>It's because I knew I was
too scared to go back.</i>

2371
02:42:35,337 --> 02:42:37,339
<i>And if
we weren't together,</i>

2372
02:42:37,407 --> 02:42:40,776
<i>if all of us alive
weren't united,</i>

2373
02:42:40,843 --> 02:42:43,078
<i>I knew we'd all die.</i>

2374
02:42:43,145 --> 02:42:47,517
<i>So, I made
the only logical move.</i>

2375
02:42:47,584 --> 02:42:49,284
<i>I took myself
off the board.</i>

2376
02:42:51,554 --> 02:42:53,155
<i>Did it work?</i>

2377
02:42:54,823 --> 02:42:56,859
<i>Well, if you're reading
this, you know the answer.</i>

2378
02:42:59,194 --> 02:43:01,163
<i>I lived
my whole life afraid.</i>

2379
02:43:03,031 --> 02:43:07,102
<i>Afraid of
what would come next.</i>

2380
02:43:07,169 --> 02:43:09,238
<i>Afraid of what
I might leave behind.</i>

2381
02:43:12,207 --> 02:43:13,242
<i>Don't.</i>

2382
02:43:15,277 --> 02:43:17,380
<i>Be who you want to be.</i>

2383
02:43:18,647 --> 02:43:20,215
<i>Be proud.</i>

2384
02:43:20,949 --> 02:43:22,585
You sleep okay?

2385
02:43:22,651 --> 02:43:23,986
Yeah.

2386
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,955
I had a beautiful dream.

2387
02:43:27,022 --> 02:43:29,858
<i>And if you find
someone worth holding on to,</i>

2388
02:43:31,059 --> 02:43:33,929
<i>never ever let them go.</i>

2389
02:43:42,505 --> 02:43:44,173
<i>Follow your own path.</i>

2390
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:50,312
<i>Wherever that takes you.</i>

2391
02:43:56,852 --> 02:43:59,988
<i>Think of this letter
as a promise.</i>

2392
02:44:02,991 --> 02:44:05,127
<i>A promise
I'm asking you to make.</i>

2393
02:44:06,362 --> 02:44:07,363
<i>To me.</i>

2394
02:44:08,598 --> 02:44:09,932
<i>To each other.</i>

2395
02:44:11,867 --> 02:44:13,302
<i>An oath.</i>

2396
02:44:17,172 --> 02:44:19,208
<i>See,
the thing about being a Loser</i>

2397
02:44:21,910 --> 02:44:23,979
<i>is you don't have
anything to lose.</i>

2398
02:44:26,649 --> 02:44:28,585
<i>So...</i>

2399
02:44:28,651 --> 02:44:30,587
<i>Be true.</i>

2400
02:44:30,653 --> 02:44:31,853
<i>Be brave.</i>

2401
02:44:32,888 --> 02:44:34,089
<i>Stand.</i>

2402
02:44:34,856 --> 02:44:36,825
<i>Believe.</i>

2403
02:44:36,892 --> 02:44:39,194
<i>And don't ever forget...</i>

2404
02:44:40,329 --> 02:44:41,797
<i>We're Losers,</i>

2405
02:44:43,065 --> 02:44:45,033
<i>and we always will be.</i>

2406
02:44:55,750 --> 02:45:02,750
