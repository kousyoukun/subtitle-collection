1
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:46,413
你真是不可思议。
You were incredible.

2
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,283
我的心还在狂跳。
My heart is still racing.

3
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,419
我也感觉到了。
I felt it too.

4
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,454
这都要归功于你的蛮力，Dash。
All thanks to your brute strength, Dash,

5
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,659
以及你对古代阿拉姆语数学的了解。
and your knowledge of ancient Aramaic mathematics.

6
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,662
请注意。这与我的两个博士学位没有关系
Please. This has nothing to do with my two doctorates

7
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,897
和我的性别研究硕士课程
and my master's in Gender Studies

8
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,768
和所有与你有关的事情，洛夫莫尔博士。
and everything to do with you, Dr. Lovemore.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,069
事实是。
The truth is,

10
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,539
我从未想过我能找到失落的D城。
I never thought I would find the Lost City of D.

11
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:14,609
我会仔细选择你的措辞。
I would choose your words carefully.

12
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,443
他们将是你的最后一次。
They will be your last.

13
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:20,314
你带我到卡拉曼国王的墓前
You led me right to King Kalaman's tomb

14
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:24,018
和他的女王的传奇性的火之冠。
and his queen's legendary Crown of Fire.

15
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,021
现在我将变得非常富有。
And now I will be very rich,

16
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,891
而你将会死得很惨。
and you will be very dead.

17
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:34,161
暂停。这些是...这些是你的蛇吗？
Hold up. Are these... Are these your snakes?

18
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,863
不，他们只是在这里。
No, they were just here.

19
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:38,432
这座寺庙里有数百条蛇
There were just hundreds of snakes in this temple

20
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,400
只是在等待我们出现？
just waiting for us to show up?

21
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,604
- 谁喂养它们？你喂他们？
- 不，他们吃什么？
- Who feeds them? You feed them?
- No, what do they eat?

22
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:44,906
为什么那个人没有咬那个人？为什么会出现这种情况？
Why is that one not biting that guy? Why is that happening?

23
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,875
- 他们是否接受过不咬随从或其他方面的训练？
- 是的，嗯...
- Are they trained not to bite henchmen or something?
- Yeah, well...

24
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,277
我的意思是，光是蛇与寺庙的比例...
I mean, the snake-to-temple ratio alone...

25
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,880
这很荒唐。删除。
This is ridiculous. Delete.

26
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,950
I...我想我的性格还是可以的。
I... I think my character can still work.

27
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,785
删除。
Delete.

28
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,220
洛雷塔，你仍然有一个故事要写。
Loretta, you still have a story to write.

29
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,122
删除。
Delete.

30
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,293
<i>嘿，是我，贝丝。</i>。
Hey, it's me, Beth.

31
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,830
<i>我不想打出 "我是你的出版商 "的牌，但我就是这样。
I don't want to pull the whole "I'm your publisher" card, but I am.

And I'm really looking forward to seeing this last chapter.

<i>但没有压力。不，实际上有压力。</i>
But no pressure. No, there actually is pressure.

<i>又是我。</i>

38
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,813
<i>好的，所以一切都准备好了，以便进行图书巡回展，</i>。
Okay, so everything is set for the book tour,

39
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:28,750
<i>但是，呃，我们唯一需要的是一本可以巡回展出的书。
but, uh, the only thing we need is a book to tour with.

40
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,985
<i>我不禁有一种感觉，你没有完成</i>。
I can't help but get the feeling that you're not finishing

41
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:33,554
<i>因为你不想离开你的房子。</i>。
because you don't want to leave your house.

42
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:38,860
<i>听着，我知道在约翰去世后的这五年很艰难，</i>。
Listen, I know these last five years have been hard after John's passing,

43
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,362
<i>在你的浴缸里生活感觉更轻松，</i>。
and it feels easier to live in your bathtub,

44

<i>在冰上喝霞多丽</i>。
drinking Chardonnay on ice.

45
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,002
<i>但是，女孩，有一个很大的世界在等着你</i>。
But, girl, there is a great big world waiting for you

46
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:51,139
<i>还有一个我不能取消的巡回售书活动，所以请务必实现它，好吗？
and a book tour that I can't cancel, so just make it happen, all right?

47
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,540
<i>爱你，再见！</i>。
Love you, bye!

48
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,027
<i>我们必须继续前进。</i>。
We have to keep going.

49
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,496
让我们看看那扇门的另一边有什么。
Let's see what's on the other side of that door.

50
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,766
但如果什么都没有呢？
But what if there isn't anything?

51
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,602
只有一个办法可以找到答案。
There's only one way to find out.

52
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,371
然后Lovemore意识到
Then Lovemore realized

53
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,741
她想要的宝藏永远失去了
the treasure she wanted was lost forever

54
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,242
而她的冒险也即将结束。
and her adventures were coming to an end.

55
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,477
这感觉不对。
That doesn't feel right.

56
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,379
是的，但仅此而已。
Yeah, but that's it.

57
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:33,981
这就结束了。
That's the end.

58
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,625
好吧，约翰。
Well, John,

59
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:46,259
在这里，我走了。
here I go.

60
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,696
<i>Dulcius ex asperis.</i>。
Dulcius ex asperis.

61
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,839
- 好了，亲爱的，表演时间到了。
- 你确定这一点吗？
- Okay, honey, it's showtime.
- Are you sure about this?

62
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:01,609
因为我在这个东西里，后面和前面都有一个楔子。
Because I have a wedgie in the back and in the front in this thing.

63
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,878
我觉得自己像一个呆板的花样滑冰运动员。
I feel like a nerdy figure skater.

64
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,681
- 性感。Stunner。我都是这样的。
- 不，不是的。它不是。
- Sexy. Stunner. I'm all about it.
- No, it's not. It's not.

65
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,750
- 我如何在这里面移动？
- 不要碰它。
- How do I move in this?
- Don't touch it.

66
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:11,052
- 我没有碰它。我把它拿出来了。
- 停止吧。你会停下来吗？
- I'm not touching it. I'm holding it out.
- Stop it. Will you stop?

67
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,353
现在就把它拿出来，因为你不能在舞台上这样做。
Get it out now 'cause you can't do that onstage.

68
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,157
我们已经完成了。我们已经完成了。好的，很好。
And we're done. And we're done. Okay, good.

69
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,159
我需要穿上闪闪发光的连衣裙吗？
Do I need to be wearing a glitter onesie?

70
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,694
你只需要穿两个小时就可以了。
You only have to wear this for two hours.

71
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,763
不要搞砸了，你听到了吗？这是借来的。
Do not mess this up, do you hear me? This is on loan.

72
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,898
现在每个人都在穿亮片。
Everyone's wearing sequins right now.

73
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,467
- 她为什么要拍我的照片？
- 这就是艾莉森。
- Why is she taking my photo?
- This is Allison.

74
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,871
她是我们新的社会媒体经理。
She is our new social media manager.

75
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,807
她将帮助我们瞄准年轻群体。
And she's gonna be helping us target that younger demographic.

76
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,408
意思是30多岁的女性，希望她们在20多岁的时候。
Meaning women in their 30s who wish they were in their 20s.

77
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,011
嘿，怎么了？
Hey, what's up?

78
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,515
嗯，我接管了你的社交网站，所以今天早上你发了推特。
Um, I took over your socials, so this morning you tweeted,

79
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:45,820
"我的女士们在哪里？下午5点在G宴会厅等我。
"Where are my ladies at? Meet me at Ballroom G at 5:00 p.m.

80
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,354
#ShawnMendes。
#ShawnMendes.

81
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,323
#GaggingToMeetYouAll"。
#GaggingToMeetYouAll."

82
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,960
好了，我们正在享受乐趣。我们走吧。
Okay, we are having fun. Let's go.

83
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,997
我们需要提醒人们，你还活着。
We need to remind people that you are still alive.

84
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,497
人们知道我还活着。
People know I'm alive.

85
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,567
并提醒他们为什么这曾经是
And to remind them why this used to be

86
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,803
- 最畅销的特许经营权。
- 在浪漫中。
- the best selling franchise.
- In Romance.

87
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,437
是的，这是创收最多的文学类别。
Yes, which is the top revenue-generating literary category.

88
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:07,440
创收并不是我现在要描述我们的预售。
Revenue-generating isn't how I would describe our presales right now.

89
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,677
就把这看作是一种利用口碑的方式。
Just think of this as a way that uses word of mouth.

90
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,411
哦，你想要口碑？在这里，我们走了。这个怎么样？
Oh, you want word of mouth? Here we go. How's this?

91
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:14,347
"唯一比城市更迷失的是作者本人"。
"The only thing more lost than the city is the author herself."

92
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,184
"无爱"。
"没有激情"。
"Loveless."
"Passionless."

93
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,221
呃，"已经过了她的黄金时期"。还有，哦。
"这是最糟糕的假历史"。
Uh, "Way past her prime." And, oh,
"This is fake history at its worst."

94
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,489
一次图书巡展可以改变一切，好吗？
A book tour could change everything, okay?

95
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,892
我们必须提醒粉丝们为什么他们这么爱你。
We have to remind the fans why they love you so much.

96
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:28,596
真实的历史。我只是把它换成了多一点的裸体。
Real history. I merely season it with a smidge more nudity.

97
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,965
历史上有大量的裸体行为。
History had a ton of nudity.

98

Will Lovemore and Dash find Queen Taha's priceless Crown of Fire?

101
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,511
<i>加入他们的搜索。</i>。
Join them on their search.

102
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,546
所以，听着，我想和你谈谈一些事情。
So, listen, I wanted to talk to you about something.

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,881
有这么多的人。
There's so many people.

104
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,116
我知道你有多讨厌做这些事情。
I know how much you hate doing these things,

105
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,986
所以我今天邀请了艾伦来和大家做问答。
so I've invited Alan to do the Q and A with you today.

106
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,055
- 什么？
- 还有其余的图书之旅。
- What?
- And the rest of the book tour.

107
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,058
贝丝，我明确要求不要再和小飞做任何活动了......阿兰，阿兰!
Beth, I expressly asked not to do any more events with Dash... Alan, Alan!

108
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,994
- 他要羞辱我。
- 他不会羞辱你。
- He's gonna humiliate me.
- He's not gonna humiliate you.

109
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,164
谢谢你。你的工作非常出色。非常感谢你。谢谢你。
Thank you. You're very good at your job. Thank you so much. Thank you.

110
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,464
让我来帮助你。
Let me help you with that.

111
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,466
他是...他是一个沐浴露广告。
He is... He's a body wash commercial.

112
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,401
他总是浑身闪闪发光。
He's always glistening all over the place.

113
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,438
没有一次活动他的衬衫没有飞起来。
There hasn't been an event where his shirt didn't come flying off.

114
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,040
- 你希望如此。
- 嗯，他已经在这里了。
- You wish.
- Well, he's already here,

115
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:15,309
因此，穿上你的大女孩内裤，让我们去那里。
so put on your big-girl panties and let's get out there.

116
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,613
请记住，不要有暴躁的脸，大话或无聊的学术谈话。
Remember, no grumpy face, big words or boring academic talk.

117
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,016
是的，是的。
Yes! Yes!

118
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,051
来吧，RTP!
Come on, RTP!

123
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,099

- 你在跟我开玩笑吗？
- Beth, I can't do this. I'm not ready.
- Are you kidding me?

124
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,934
听着，我支持你。你有这个。
Listen, I've got your back. You got this.

去给人民他们想要的东西。
Go give the people what they want.

126

- It's not me they want.
- Get out there now!

00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:56,984
是的。装上它。
Yep. Mount it.

129
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,323
装上它。装上它。好的。
Mount it. Mount it. Okay.

130
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,091
找到你的中心。
Find your center.

131
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,762
而现在，你们都在等待的时刻。
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.

132
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,630
- 最性感的...
- 好的！
- The sexiest...
- All right!

133
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:13,734
...一代人中最有影响力的英雄。
...most influential hero of a generation.

134
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,036
这话说得有点重。
That's a bit strong.

135
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,872
他的第20本安吉拉-洛夫莫尔小说的封面。
His 20th cover of an Angela Lovemore novel.

136
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,541
Dash McMahon!
Dash McMahon!

137
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,516
哦，我的上帝！小飞！
Oh, my God! Dash!

138
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,574
- 鞠躬吧。
- 我已经做了我的。我做了我的。
- Take a bow.
- I already did mine. I did mine.

139
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,644
好吧，来吧。再来一个。我抓住你了。
Okay, come on. One more. I got you.

140
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,227
你们排练过吗？哦，我的天。
Did you guys rehearse that? Oh, my God.

141
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:17,198
我很喜欢你们俩之间的这种化学反应，我得说。
I'm loving this chemistry between you two, and I got to say,

142
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,433
我喜欢这本书。
I love this book.

143
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,601
- 哦，谢谢你，雷。
- 谢谢...
- Oh, thank you, Ray.
- Thank...

144
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,103
扰流板警告。
Spoiler alert.

145
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,471
一个非常大胆的选择
A really bold choice

146
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,506
为了不让他们在最后进入坟墓。
to not have them go into the tomb at the end.

147
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,208
谈谈这一次是怎么做的。
Talk about what went into this one.

148
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,778
我的意思是，这本书对我个人来说是如此特别。
I mean, this one's such a special book for me personally.

149
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,714
I...我不知道该怎么说它对我的意义有多大
I... I don't know how to say how much it means to me

150
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,916
那位洛雷塔，文字作家的特长。
that Loretta, word writer extraordinaire,

151
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,086
已经，你知道，以我的名字命名这本书。
has, you know, named the book after me.

152
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,022
<i>《失落的达什之城》</i>。
The Lost City of Dash.

153
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,189
<i>《失落的D城》</i>。
The Lost City of D.

154
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:44,558
嗯，但这不是D所代表的含义。
Um, but that's not what the D stands for.

155
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,228
- 是 "D "的意思，对吗？
- 没有鸡巴，没有。
- It's D for "dick," right?
- No dick, no.

156
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,431
它是基于一个古老部落的名字，Dapocagihou-dysphem-ica。
It's based on the name of an ancient tribe, Dapocagihou-dysphem-ica.

157
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:55,136
而且，嗯，这对欧洲殖民者来说太难发音了。
And, um, it was too difficult for the European colonizers to pronounce,

158
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,472
- 因此，以真正的殖民主义方式，他们把它缩写了。
- 没有人关心这个问题。
- so, in true colonial fashion they abbreviated it.
- No one cares about this.

159
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,274
这真是太有趣了。好的。
That's so interesting. Okay.

160
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,710
我们从观众那里接受一些问题如何？
How about we take some questions from the audience?

161
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,578
- 就在这里，帅哥！
- 是的。
- Right here, handsome!
- Yes.

162
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:08,816
- 小飞，你最喜欢的浪漫时刻是什么？
- 哦。
- Dash, what's your favorite romantic moment?
- Ooh.

163
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:13,487
我真正想知道的是，洛雷塔最喜欢的浪漫时刻是什么？
What I would really like to know is what is Loretta's favorite romantic moment?

164
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,524
哦，辣的。
Ooh, spicy.

165
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,558
哦，呃...
Oh, uh...

166
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,327
好吧，作为一个无性恋者...
Well, being a sapiosexual...

167
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,663
哦，是当他们做的蛇周围的...
Oh, is that when they do the snakes around the...

168
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:26,867
不，那是一个发现，呃，智力的人
No. That's someone who finds, uh, intellect

169
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:30,905
或智慧，呃，非常性感，你知道。
or intelligence, uh, very sexy, you know.

170
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,139
一样。
Same.

171
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,808
真的吗？
Really?

172
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,310
冲啊！扯掉你的衬衫！
Dash! Rip off your shirt!

173
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:40,147
不，不，不。我们今天不打算这么做。我们是为洛雷塔的书而来。
No, no, no. We're not gonna do that today. We're here for Loretta's book.

174
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:42,116
我们有问题要问Loretta吗？
Do we have questions for Loretta?

175
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:47,421
呃，是的，看起来很好学的年轻女士？你想问我什么？
Uh, yes, studious-looking young lady? What would you like to ask me?

176
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,558
你能撕掉小飞的衬衫吗？
Can you rip off Dash's shirt?

177
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,928
不，不。我们不会再这样做了。对不起。
No, no. We're not gonna do this again. Sorry.

178
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,565
撕掉它!撕掉它！
Rip it off! Rip it off!

179
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,999
撕掉它!撕掉它！扯掉它！ 扯掉它！
Rip it off! Rip it off! Rip it off!

180
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,903
当然了。当然，是的。可以做。
Of course. Of course, yes. Can do.

181
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,072
有这种情况吗？
Is this happening?

182
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,907
- 你不需要这样做。
- 哦，我们必须这样做。
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh, we have to.

183
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,076
我们必须给人民他们想要的东西。是的，是的。
We have to give the people what they want. Yes, yes.

184
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,912
我们必须给人民他们想要的东西，是的。
We have to give the people what they want, yes.

185
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:15,249
女士们，先生们，请欣赏。
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy.

186
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:20,020
因为<i>《失落的D城》</i>。
是小飞的最后一次冒险。
Because The Lost City of D
is Dash's final adventure.

187
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,189
如果甚至有下一本书的话。
If there even is a next book,

188
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:25,426
它将以Lovemore收到悲惨的消息开始
it will open with Lovemore receiving the tragic news

189
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,928
他英年早逝的消息。
of his untimely death.

190
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,330
什么？
What?

191
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,931
- 该死的。我很抱歉。我的智能手表被卡住了。
- 嗷。坚持住。
- Shit. I'm sorry. My smartwatch is stuck.
- Ow. Hold on.

192
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,099
我知道。不要拉它。
I know. Don't pull it.

193
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,734
没关系的。只要仍然是真实的。
It's okay. Just be real still.

194
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,236
- 不，那是在拉动它。
- 你在拉动它。
- No. That's pulling it.
- You're pulling it.

195
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,005
你要把我的假发扯下来。不，你不能...
You're gonna rip my wig off. No, you can't...

196
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,344
哦，我的天啊!
Oh, my!

197
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,845
- 哦，我的上帝。
- 他还好吗？
- Oh, my God.
- Is he okay?

198
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,548
上帝，我很抱歉。我真的很抱歉。
God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,316
- 我很抱歉。
- 你是个坏人。
- I'm so sorry.
- You're a bad person.

200
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,754
晚上6点，坚持参加服装比赛。
Stick around for the costume contest at 6:00 p.m.

201
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:56,690
"如果有另一本书"？
"If there is another book"?

202
00:10:56,824 --> 00:11:01,729
我将把我们的一切都投入到这次巡演中，好吗？
I'm investing everything we've got into this tour, okay?

203
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,332
我只是不认为我有另一个Dash和Lovemore的冒险。
I just don't think I have another Dash and Lovemore adventure in me.

204
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,800
小飞是怎么死的？
How does Dash die?

205
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,036
- 是蛇的问题吗？
- 没有。
- Was it the snakes?
- No.

206
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,472
好的，所以我有一些事情必须要处理。
Okay, so I have something that I have to take care of.

207
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:14,041
10分钟后，你们在隔壁套房有一个采访。
You guys have an interview in the next suite in ten minutes.

208
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,578
所以，你们能不能帮我一个忙，做个大人？
So can you please do me a favor and be grown-ups

209
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,212
并让你们自己去那里？
and get yourselves there on your own?

210
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,548
好的。非常感谢你。
Okay. Thank you so much.

211
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,416
他是否死于葡萄球菌感染？
Does he die from a staph infection?

212
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,453
它是一种葡萄球菌感染。我知道它。
It is a staph infection. I knew it.

213
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:28,956
我...好的。
I-I... All right.

214
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,126
听着，如果你需要休息或什么，我明白。
Look, I get it if you need a break or something,

215
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,261
- 但你不能就这样杀了我，好吗？
- 好的。
- but you can't just kill me, okay?
- Okay.

216
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:38,766
我讨厌我必须这样问，但你知道你不是大飞，对吗？
I hate that I have to ask this, but you do know you're not Dash, right?

217
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,068
小飞是我编造的一个角色。
Dash is a character I made up.

218
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:42,436
潇洒？
Dash?

219
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,473
谢谢。
Thanks.

220
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:47,841
谢谢你。
Thank you.

221
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,514
- 洛雷塔，是这样的。
- 不，我认为是这样的。
- Loretta, it's this way.
- No, I think it's this way.

222
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,982
难道你看不出小飞对人们意味着什么吗？
Can't you see that Dash means so much to people?

223
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,884
- 对你来说意义重大。
- 对我来说不是。
- Means so much to you.
- Not to me.

224
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,620
嗯，是的，对我来说，但对其他人来说也是如此。
Well, yeah, to me, but to other people too.

225
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,690
- 贝丝怎么样了？
- 你知道吗？贝丝会好起来的。
- What about Beth?
- You know what? Beth is gonna be fine.

226
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:05,694
她会发现很多新鲜的、充满伟大思想的年轻作家。
She's gonna find plenty fresh, young writers full of great ideas.

227
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,795
你可以优雅地过渡
You can transition gracefully

228
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,264
进入你的模特生涯的穿衣阶段。
into the shirt-on phase of your modeling career,

229
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,700
而我可以独处。
and I can be left alone.

230
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,535
大家都很高兴。
Everybody is happy.

231
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,402
不，是这样的。
No, it's this way.

232
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,338
贝丝说你甚至不再离开房子了。
Beth says you don't even leave the house anymore.

233
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,473
我觉得这不是很开心。
I don't feel like that's very happy.

234
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,476
你应该到外面的世界去，用新的经验来充实自己。
You should be going out in the world, filling yourself up on new experiences.

235
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,812
我已经被填满了。我已经饱了。我已经完全吃饱了。
I'm already filled up. I'm full. I'm fully satiated.

236
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,282
当你可以看到这个世界时，你为什么想一个人呆在家里呢？
Why would you want to be stuck at home alone when you could see the world?

237
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,917
你可能是在访问古希腊。
You could be visiting ancient Greece.

238
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,920
好吧，我怎么能访问古希腊呢？
Okay. How could I visit ancient Greece?

239
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,055
我明白了。因为你害怕飞行。
I get it. Because you're afraid of flying.

240
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:38,627
不，因为古希腊已经成为过去。
No. Because ancient Greece is in the past.

241
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,261
就像Dash一样。
Just like Dash.

242
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:43,565
好吧，你想知道还有谁停留在过去吗？你是。
Okay. You want to know who else is stuck in the past? You are.

243
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,467
你如此害怕生活再次伤害你，以至于你已经停止生活。
You're so afraid of life hurting you again that you've stopped living.

244
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,936
你就像一个人类的木乃伊。
You're like a human mummy.

245
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,439
我没有，嗯...
I didn't, um...

246
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,842
哦。
Oh.

247
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,077
木乃伊是人类。
Mummies are human.

248
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,355
愚蠢的...哦，糟糕。
Stupid... Oh, crap.

249
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,325
我很抱歉。我......我会把它清理干净的。
I'm so sorry. I-I will clean this up.

250
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,894
我不是一个爱乱丢东西的人，我向你保证。
I am not a litterer, I-I assure you that.

251
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:17,532
你，嗯...你认为你可以，呃，为我叫一辆车，好吗？
Do you, um... Do you think you could, uh, call a car for me, please?

252
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,199
谢谢你。谢谢你。
Thank you. Thank you.

253
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,070
把车开过来。
Bring the car around.

254
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,606
天啊，那是某人的聘金吗？
God, is that someone's retainer?

255
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,074
我在她身边从来没有说过一次正确的话。
I've never said the right thing one time around her.

256
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,076
我感到紧张，因为她开口了。
I get nervous because she opens her mouth,

257
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,682
和只是一个美丽的百科全书出来，和我只是从来没有说...
and just an encyclopedia of beautifulness comes out, and I just never say...

258
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,082
你知道她想杀我吗？
You know she's trying to kill me?

259
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,351
我只是需要那些西红柿。
I just need those tomatoes.

260
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,820
你是对的。不，你是对的。
You're right. No, you're right.

261
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,422
我应该道歉。谢谢你，伙计。
I should apologize. Thank you, man.

262
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,824
- 我非常、非常欣赏这一点。
- 不客气。
- I appreciate that very, very much.
- You're welcome.

263
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,203
呃，洛雷塔-塞奇。是的。
Uh, Loretta Sage. Yeah.

264
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,510
呃...
Uh...

265
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:04,978
你好。
Hiya.

266
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,548
呃，我没有订购UberPool。
Uh, I did not order an UberPool.

267
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,651
有人要见你。我们会让你马上回来。
Someone wants to meet you. We'll have you right back.

268
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,018
嗯...
Um...

269
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:15,724
洛雷塔!
Loretta!

270
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,391
洛雷塔！洛雷塔？洛雷塔？
Loretta! Loretta?

271
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,096
呃，洛雷塔？
Uh, Loretta?

272
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,799
- 你说 "洛雷塔 "吗？
- 是的。
- Did you say "Loretta"?
- Yeah.

273
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,100
- 跟着那辆SUV，伙计。
- 没有。
- Follow that SUV, man.
- No.

274
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,935
- 来吧，请！
- 不，不，不。
- Come on, please!
- No, no, no.

275
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,138
我不会再帮助任何英俊的陌生人了。骗我一次吧。嗯，嗯，嗯。
I'm not helping any more handsome strangers. Fool me once. Mm-mmm.

276
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,576
这是什么，<i>Taken？<i>我是 "Taken "吗？
What is this, Taken? Am I "tooken"?

277
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,076
我已经被卖了吗？
Am I sold already?

278
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,179
我是不是...我被卖给他了吗？
Am I... Am I sold to him?

279
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:42,950
- 嗷。停止。
- 哦，不。这是不是感觉很惊悚？
- Ow. Stop.
- Oh, no. Did this feel creepy?

280
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,720
我说不要让它变得令人毛骨悚然，伙计们。
I said don't make it creepy, guys.

281
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,622
我对这个设置感到非常抱歉。
I'm so sorry about the setting.

282
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,324
我刚刚飞来。我当时真的很慌张地要见你。
I just flew in. I was in a real panic to meet you.

283
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,493
我没有时间把这个地方打扮得很好。
I didn't have time to dress the place up much.

284
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:55,396
我读到你喜欢奶酪，所以我就把它们都买了。
I read you love cheese, so I just got them all.

285
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,534
你就是那个一直给我发电子邮件要我的脚的照片的人吗？
Are you the one who's been emailing me for photos of my feet?

286
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,468
不，嗯...
No. Um...

287
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:05,973
我保证我将要给你看的东西会让你非常高兴。
And I promise what I'm about to show you is gonna make you very happy.

288
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:07,876
但首先，有一点
But first, a little bit

289
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:11,178
关于你面前的这个神秘的流氓。
about the mysterious rogue you see before you.

290
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,548
呃，我的名字是阿比盖尔-费尔法克斯。
Uh, my name is Abigail Fairfax.

291
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:16,618
- 阿比盖尔？
- 这是一个不分性别的名字，像Leslie或Beverly。
- Abigail?
- It's a gender-neutral name, like Leslie or Beverly.

292
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:20,487
是的，但你是媒体大亨费尔法克斯家族的阿比盖尔-费尔法克斯？
Yes, but you're Abigail Fairfax of the media-mogul Fairfaxes?

293
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,559
你不是刚刚接管了你的公司吗，还是...
Didn't you just take over your company or...

294
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:28,596
不，实际上那是我哥哥。那是莱斯利。我们都很自豪。
No, that was my brother, actually. That was Leslie. We're all very proud.

295
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,833
啊。是的，我应该这么说，在这样一个年轻的年龄到...
Ah. Yes, I should say so, at such a young age to...

296
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,868
有些人甚至会说太年轻了。
Some might even say too young.

297
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,704
但那个世界从未让我真正感兴趣。
But that world never really interested me.

298
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:39,373
我的激情，你可能知道。
My passions, as you may know,

299
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:42,610
躺在世界的隐秘事物中。
lie in the hidden things in the world,

300
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:45,312
不敢拥有的东西。
things which defy possession.

301
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:48,482
嗯，有人可能会说我是个收藏家。
Um, some might call me a collector.

302
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:52,319
但有一个人特别痴迷于此
But there is one obsession in particular

303
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,556
俘虏了我。
that has held me captive.

304
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:57,090
火之冠
The Crown of Fire

305
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,561
和其层层叠叠的红色钻石。
and its cascading red diamonds.

306
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:03,330
这是不是...这是一个隐藏的摄像机的事情吗？
Is this a... Is this a hidden-camera thing?

307
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:07,034
因此，想象一下我的惊讶吧，在你的新书中。
So imagine my surprise when, in your new book,

308
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,437
在交媾遐想的书页中。
amidst the pages of coital reverie,

309
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:11,338
是什么...
was something...

310
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,541
- 哦，上帝。
- ...相当宏伟。
- Oh, God.
- ...quite magnificent.

311
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,946
我明白了。我明白了。我现在非常明白。
I get it. I get it. I so get it right now.

312
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,346
哦，我的天啊。
Oh, my gosh.

313
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,649
我真的以为是你们绑架了我。
I literally thought you guys kidnapped me.

314
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:24,251
我的意思是，这是市场营销，对吗？贝丝设置了这个？
I mean, this is marketing, right? Beth set this up?

315
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,254
这真是太好了，你们这些家伙。这真是太神奇了。
This was so good, you guys. This was amazing.

316
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,592
你，带着你的枪和你的胡子
You, with your gun and your mustache

317
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,695
和你的，"你最好到那里去"，你知道...
and your, "You'd better get in there" and you know...

318
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,396
哦，我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

319
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:40,234
你，穿着G.I.Joe色调的衣服。
You, with the G.I. Joe tone-on-tone outfit.

320
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:45,372
你虚构的考古学家正在对一种死的语言进行真实的翻译。
Your fictional archaeologist was making real translations of a dead language.

321
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:48,375
- 嗯，嗯。
- 没有其他人能够做到的事情。
- Mm-hmm.
- Something nobody else has been able to do.

322
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,912
好吧，没有人曾经尝试过。
Well, nobody else had ever tried.

323
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,881
这样做对吗？我说的对吗？
Is that right? Am I saying the right thing?

324
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,649
除了你，对吗？
Except you, right?

325
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,651
除了我!
Except me!

326
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,452
是的，你看，事实证明
Yes. See, it turns out

327
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:01,856
Loretta Sage曾经是一个年轻的女大学生，正在做她的论文
Loretta Sage was once a young college girl doing her dissertation

328
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,826
在与她未来的丈夫的D的死语言上。
on the dead language of the D with her future husband,

329
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,028
梦想着找到卡拉曼的坟墓和火之冠。
dreaming of finding Kalaman's tomb and the Crown of Fire.

330
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,265
我很遗憾地看到你在他死后放弃了你的搜索。
I was sorry to read you gave up your search after he died.

331
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,066
但这意味着什么呢？
But what that means is,

332
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,169
你是我的全部。
you're all I have left.

333
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,473
所有--你所剩下的......什么？
All-All you have left for... what?

334
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:20,642
嗯。
Hmm.

335
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,678
哦。
Oh.

336
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:25,212
在这里，我们走了。
Here we go.

337
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,962
这是什么？
What is this?

338
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:44,766
我相信它描述的是卡拉曼墓的确切位置。
I believe it is describing the exact location of Kalaman's tomb,

339
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:48,335
塔哈和她无价的头饰被埋在其中。
in which Taha and her priceless headdress are buried.

340
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,572
嗯，如果这是真实的。
Well, if this were authentic,

341
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:56,010
你还是要揭开整个城市的面纱
you would still have to uncover an entire city

342
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,146
没有人能够找到。
that nobody has been able to find.

343
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,882
我发现了它。
I found it.

344
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,117
在大西洋中一个被遗忘的小岛上，名为 "Hundida岛"。
On a tiny, forgotten island in the Atlantic called Isla Hundida.

345
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:07,789
我没能找到的是卡拉曼的最终安息地。
What I have not been able to find is Kalaman's final resting place.

346
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:12,192
这张羊皮纸是我们在废墟中发现的唯一线索。
This piece of parchment is the only clue we found among the ruins.

347
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:15,495
我需要一个能破译这些符号的人。
I need someone who can decipher these symbols.

348
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,665
我需要你。
I need you.

349
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,200
- 嗯...
- 赛奇小姐。
- Well...
- Miss Sage,

350
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,671
这肯定不是你想让你的故事结束的方式。
surely this isn't how you want your story to end.

351
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:26,373
我们都被厄运击碎了梦想。
We both had our dreams crushed by bad luck,

352
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,743
或者就我而言，一个拍马屁的小兄弟。
or in my case, an arse-kissing little brother,

353
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:31,980
但这是我们向他们展示所有的机会。
but this is our chance to show them all.

354
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,648
和我一起......到岛上来。
Come with me... to the island.

355
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:38,920
翻译这些符号，帮我找到火之冠。
Translate these symbols and help me find the Crown of Fire.

356
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,689
你可以说出你的价格。
You can name your price.

357
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,127
我必须恭敬地拒绝。
I must respectfully decline.

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,233
嗯...
Well...

359
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,738
我不能说我不感到失望。
I can't say I'm not disappointed.

360
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:00,173
但我理解你的感受。
But I understand how you feel.

361
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,178
你至少能让我们送你一程吗？
Will you at least let us give you a ride?

362
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:09,651
哦，不，谢谢你。我叫我自己的车，然后我就...
Oh, no, thank you. I'll call for my own car, and I'll just...

363
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,942
我不觉得你在听我说话。这很紧急，而且我们...
I don't feel like you're listening to me. This is urgent, and we...

364
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:38,012
好吧，警察说他们发出了全境通告......。
Okay, so the police are saying that they put out an APB...

365
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:39,747
- APB。
- ...在一辆SUV上。
- APB.
- ...on an SUV,

366
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,083
- 而且还有这个24小时的规则...
- 为什么会有这样的规定？
- and there's this 24-hour rule...
- Why is there a rule?

367
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,619
- ...而且他们不会做任何事情，直到...
- 那么联邦调查局或中央情报局呢？
- ...and they won't do anything until...
- What about the FBI or the CIA?

368
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,721
- 他们说要打电话给警察。
- 我确信洛雷塔很好。
- They said to call the police.
- I'm sure Loretta's fine.

369
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,389
当我在大学时，我的朋友尼基失踪了。
When I was in college, my friend Nicki went missing.

370
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,125
每个人都像是被吓坏了。
Everyone was, like, freaking out.

371
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,561
但那时她只是在她的车里。
But then she was just in her car.

372
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:56,831
她已经死了，但我们找到了她。她并没有走。
She was dead, but we found her. She wasn't gone.

373
00:19:56,964 --> 00:20:01,301
嗯，那什么...也许我们可以找一个PI
Um, what about... Maybe we could get a PI

374
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,938
或者，像，你知道，私人保安或...
or, like, you know, private security or...

375
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:05,940
像电影中那样的救援队怎么样？
What about an extraction team, like the movie?

376
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,543
是的！但谁会这样做呢？退役军人，对吗？
Yes! But who does that? The ex-military, right?

377
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:11,244
哦，是的。我想我实际上有一个人可以帮助我们。
Oh, yeah. I think I actually have somebody that could help us.

378
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,314
- 哦。
- 我做了这个冥想闭关。
- Oh.
- I did this meditation retreat,

379
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,483
那里有一个培训师。
and there was this trainer guy there.

380
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,119
你应该看看这家伙的冥想。
You should see this guy meditate.

381
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,654
但他是前海豹队员。
But he's ex-Navy SEAL.

382
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:23,591
他...他是一个特别行动训练员。他叫什么名字？
He... He's a special ops trainer. What was his name?

383
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,358
是的。杰克-训练师。
Yeah. Jack Trainer.

384
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,061
所以他是一个叫杰克-训练师的训练师？
So he's a trainer named Jack Trainer?

385
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:29,362
这就是我的手机里的所有人。看，"珍妮丝妈妈"。
That's how I have everybody in my phone. See, "Janice Mom."

386
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,898
"拉里-门把手"。
"斯泰西屁股的东西"。
"Larry Doorknob."
"Stacy Butt Stuff."

387
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:33,735
看，这就是这家伙的工作。他找到了人。
Look, this is what this guy does. He finds people.

388
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:36,137
如果有任何人能帮助我们，那就是他。
If there's anybody that can help us, it's him.

389
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:45,580
- <i>Jack Trainer.</i>
- 哦，所以他的名字实际上是杰克-特拉尔。
- Jack Trainer.
- Oh, so his name is actually Jack Trainer.

390
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:49,650
嗨，呃，我是 "触摸你的内在 "的艾伦。
Hi, uh, this is Alan from "Touching Your Inner Self."

391
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,920
冥想闭关？
The meditation retreat?

392
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,625
总之，呃，好吧。我们的朋友Loretta被绑架了。
Anyway, uh, okay. Our friend Loretta has been kidnapped,

393
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,193
而没有人帮助我们。
and no one's helping us.

394
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,795
<i>她失踪多久了？</i>
How long she been missing?

395
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,196
也许是两个小时了。
Maybe two hours now.

396
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,531
<i>那是谁？</i>。
Who is that?

397
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:07,702
嗯，这是B...这是贝丝。我是贝丝。
Um, this is B... This is Beth. I'm Beth.

398
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:10,238
艾莉森也上场了，先生。
And Allison is on too, sir.

399
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,540
<i>她有任何支持Wi-Fi的设备吗？</i>。
Did she have any Wi-Fi-enabled devices?

400
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,543
- 她有她的电话，对吗？
- 不，我有她的电话。
- She's got her phone, right?
- No, I have her phone.

401
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:18,246
哦！她有一个智能手表。它把我的假发扯下来了。
Oh! She has a smartwatch. It ripped my wig off.

402
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,314
<i>那是什么情景？不要紧。打开电话。</i>
What was that scenario? Never mind. Open the phone.

403
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,984
- <i>进入智能手表应用程序。</i>。
- 好的。
- Go to the smartwatch app.
- All right.

404
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:25,385
<i>然后点击 "查找我的智能手表"</i>。
Then hit "Find My Smartwatch."

405
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,421
哦，我的...这真是太好了。这就是我们打电话的原因。
Oh, my... That is so good. That's why we called.

406
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:30,958
<i>"通过管理容易的事情来预测困难"</i>。
"Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy."

407
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:34,796
- 那是奥普拉还是迪帕克？
- <i>老子来自</i>《道德经》。
- Is that Oprah or Deepak?
- Laozi from Tao-te Ching.

408
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,097
哦，我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

409
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,865
这是在大西洋。
It's in the Atlantic.

410
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:40,367
- 她在飞机上？
- 你怎么能说出来呢？
- She's on a plane?
- How can you tell that?

411
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,637
因为她不可能游得那么快。
'Cause she can't swim that fast.

412
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,172
<i>听起来不像是一个赎金方案。
Doesn't sound like a ransom scenario.

413
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,908
<i>我猜是血腥的运动，</i>。
饥饿游戏》<i>类情况。
My guess is blood sport,
Hunger Games type situation.

414
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,844
<i>可能是一些以可卡因为燃料的暗网寻宝游戏。</i>。
Possibly some coke-fueled dark web scavenger hunt.

415
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,979
<i>真正的小丑狗屎。我们必须快速行动。</i>。
Real clown shit. We'll have to move fast.

416
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:55,016
- 我们如何支付给你？
- <i>加密货币。现金应用程序。</i>
- How do we pay you?
- Cryptocurrency. Cash App.

417
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:58,553
<i>我将在48小时内把她送回来，否则你的下一次救援是免费的。</i>。
I'll have her back within 48 hours or your next rescue is free.

418
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,154
有多少人需要下一次救援？
How many people need a next rescue?

419
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:01,756
比你想象的要多。
More than you'd think.

420
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,691
- <i>我需要那个电话。</i>。
- 我会把它带给你的。
- I'm gonna need that phone.
- I'll bring it to you.

421
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,561
<i>让我知道她在哪里降落。我在那里等你，艾伦。<i>。
Let me know where she lands. I'll meet you there, Alan.

422
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:22,710
你好。
Hello.

423
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,381
我在哪里？
Where am I?

424
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:30,483
嗯，你在我的飞机上。
Um, you're on my plane.

425
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:31,786
这很好，不是吗？嗯？
It's nice, isn't it? Hmm?

426
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,754
座椅是由玛玛拉玛皮革制成的。
The seats are made of mama llama leather.

427
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,958
好了，我要离开你的飞机了。
Well, I'm getting off your plane.

428
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:38,425
解开我的枷锁!
Unchain me!

429
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,127
那是你的安全带。
That's your seat belt.

430
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,563
你对我进行了麻醉吗？
Did you chloroform me?

431
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,899
人们真的会这样做吗？
People actually do that?

432
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:49,971
嗯，你知道，它成为经典是有原因的。
Well, you know, it's a classic for a reason.

433
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:51,839
我的身体感觉喝醉了。
My body feels drunk.

434
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:53,841
过一会儿就会消退的。我很抱歉。
It'll wear off in a bit. I am sorry.

435
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:56,310
我只是不能等着你改变主意。
I just couldn't wait around for you to change your mind.

436
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,846
- 不要再玩果冻了。
- 时间不在我们这边。
- Stop playing jelly.
- Time is not on our side.

437
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,682
你看，我们正在挖掘的火山周围的
You see, the volcano we're excavating around

438
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:03,751
已经患上了严重的消化不良。
has developed a bad case of indigestion.

439
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,720
我比较担心的是，当它爆炸的时候。
I'm rather worried that when it blows,

440
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,889
失落之城剩下的一切都将被摧毁。
everything that's left of the Lost City will be destroyed.

441
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:09,891
哦，我的上帝。我的腿不听使唤了。
Oh, my God. My legs don't work.

442
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:15,462
因此，这是我们找到墓穴和王冠的最后机会。
So, this is our last chance to find both the tomb and the crown.

443
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,598
- 哦，上帝。
- 哦!
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

444
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:19,967
不要担心。这只是我们的最后一次下山。
Don't worry. That's just our final descent.

445
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:26,140
但这是你生命中最伟大的冒险的开始。
But it is the beginning of the greatest adventure of your life.

446
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,844
欢迎来到失落的城市。
Welcome to the Lost City.

447
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:47,822
你是怎么找到它的？
How did you find it?

448
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:50,091
所以，这个城市是建立在熔岩圆顶上的。
So, the city was built on a lava dome.

449
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:52,893
随着火山的活跃，穹顶充满了熔岩。
As the volcano became active, the dome filled with lava,

450
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:55,563
和沉没的东西上升到表面。
and sunken things rose to the surface.

451
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,565
D暴露了自己。
The D exposed itself.

452
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:00,668
- 整个城市？
- 不，不。只是小费。
- The entire city?
- No, no. Just the tip.

453
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:04,005
我一听到废墟的传闻，就飞过去买下了这个地方。
As soon as I heard rumors of the ruins, I flew over and bought the place.

454
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:07,375
- 该网站？
- 不，这个岛。南部的一半。
- The site?
- No. The island. The southern half.

455
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,844
我得到了一个很好的交易，因为这里是熔岩流动的地方。
I got a good deal 'cause this is where the lava flows.

456
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:12,246
我们已经挖掘了一年了。
We've been excavating for a year now.

457
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,816
人们不会在第一天就绑架一个浪漫主义小说家。
One doesn't kidnap a romance novelist on day one.

458
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,952
啊，是的，正如俗话说的那样。
Ah, yes, as the saying goes.

459
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:21,122
拉菲不喜欢这样。你呢，拉菲？
Rafi doesn't like it. Do you, Rafi?

460
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:24,358
他说我们不尊重他的遗产。
He says we're disrespecting his heritage.

461
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:27,728
但在岛上没有很多其他的工作选择，是吗，拉菲？
But not a lot of other job options on the island, are there, Rafi?

462
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:29,964
乞丐不可能有选择。
Beggars can't be choosers.

463
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:41,575
我想，没有更多的烤肉了。
No more charcuterie, I take it.

464
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,778
嗯。求你了。我不是一个怪物。
Mmm. Please. I'm not a monster.

465
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,780
无论你需要什么，只要喊一声。
Whatever you need, just shout.

466
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:52,186
呃，留出一只手。她有一些翻译工作要做。
Uh, leave one hand free. She has some translating to do.

467
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:54,588
然后呢？
And then what?

468
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:57,124
洛雷塔，我真的希望你能试试，看看
Loretta, I really wish you would try and see

469
00:25:57,258 --> 00:25:59,360
这对我们来说是一个多么令人兴奋的机会。
what an exciting opportunity this is for us.

470
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:03,397
我相信这段文字描述了墓穴的确切位置。
I believe this text describes the exact location of the tomb.

471
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:06,067
这是个逻辑学系统。
It's a logographic system.

472
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,336
像楔形文字或象形文字。
Like cuneiform or hieroglyphics.

473
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,274
现在，如果你有其他文件，可能我可以比较一下......
Now, if you have other documents that possibly I can compare...

474
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,642
是的，那里没有运气。
Yeah, no luck there.

475
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:17,546
我们在附近的一个瀑布发现了一些抓痕。
We found some scratching at a nearby waterfall,

476
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:18,547
但这是没有用的。
but it was useless.

477
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,181
只是女人的照片。
Just pictures of women.

478
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:24,919
听着，我也希望你那亲爱的死去的老考古学家丈夫
Look, I, too, wish your dear old dead archaeologist husband

479
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:27,755
是来帮忙的，但他不在，所以。
was here to help, but he's not, so,

480
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:31,025
是时候发光了，洛雷塔，性书作家。
time to shine, Loretta, sex-book writer.

481
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,161
他们会来找我。
They will come for me.

482
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:36,430
到底是谁呢？
Who, exactly?

483
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,265
你的...你的许多猫？
Your... Your many cats?

484
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,201
哦，我没有养猫。
Oh, I don't have cats.

485
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,571
莫名其妙地更加悲伤。
Somehow even more sad.

486
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:45,639
我有一只仓鼠，混蛋！
I have a hamster, asshole!

487
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:47,374
你有一个仓鼠的屁眼？
You have a hamster's asshole?

488
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:51,245
不，有一个...有一个逗号在...之间。忘了它吧。
No, there was a... there was a comma between... Forget it.

489
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:54,815
我打赌你哥哥从来没有绑架过任何人!
I bet your brother never had to kidnap anyone!

490
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,134
很高兴见到你，伙计。
Good to see you, man.

491
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:48,903
- 电话。
- 对。
- Phone.
- Right.

492
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:01,916
什么？
What?

493
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,619
是的，我在想，我可以，你知道。
Yeah, I was thinking that I could, you know,

494
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:06,320
也许只是和你一起去。
maybe just sort of come with you.

495
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,189
- 为什么？
- 为了帮助。
- Why?
- To help.

496
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:12,426
我知道心肺复苏术。我知道一些轻型空手道。CrossFit认证。
I know CPR. I know some light karate. CrossFit certified.

497
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:14,094
好吧，好吧，听着，听着！
Okay, okay, listen, listen!

498
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,598
我只是...这是我的错。
I just... It's my fault.

499
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,766
而不是绑架之类的事情。
Not the kidnapping and stuff,

500
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:21,969
但是，我对她说了一些非常刻薄的话，而且我很后悔。
but, like, I said some really mean stuff to her, and I regret it,

501
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,704
而我只需要把它收回来。
and I just need to take it back.

502
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,239
我称她为人类的木乃伊。
I called her a human mummy.

503
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,008
木乃伊是人类。
Mummies are human.

504
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:31,011
我现在意识到了这一点，是的。
I'm aware of that now, yes.

505
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:34,215
这倒是真的。
That is true.

506
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:35,349
请。
Please.

507
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:39,320
好吧，艾伦，我不能对你负责。
All right, Alan, I can't be responsible for you.

508
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:41,255
好的，是的。
Okay. Yeah.

509
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,325
- 我需要你呆在车里。
- 是的。
- I need you to stay in the car.
- Yeah.

510
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,528
- 在车上。
- 在车上。
- In the car.
- In the car.

511
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:49,096
- 整个过程中。
- 整个过程中？
- The whole time.
- The whole time?

512
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,431
整个时间。
Whole time.

513
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:51,799
嗯，嗯。
Mm-hmm.

514
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:54,802
是的!
Yes!

515
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,110
这就是我。
This is me.

516
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:06,213
真的吗？海豹突击队就是用这个吗？
Really? Is this what the SEAL teams use?

517
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:08,983
"只有傻瓜才会以颜色来选择马。"
"Only a fool chooses a horse by its color."

518
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:11,885
对，对。<i>《道德经》？</i>。
Right, right. The Tao-te Ching?

519
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:15,189
不，这是在后面租房处的标志上。
No, it was on the sign back there at the rental place.

520
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:24,932
谢谢你。
Thank you.

521
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:59,233
什么？什么？
What? What?

522
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,404
我希望能邀请你来吃早餐。
I was hoping to invite you to breakfast,

523
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:06,240
但看起来你仍有工作要做。
but it looks like you still have work to do.

524
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,942
呃，等一下，等一下，等一下。
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

525
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:10,578
等待。等待，等待，等待。
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

526
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,681
我相信这是说
I believe this says

527
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,783
"休息 "或 "歇息"。
"rest" or "resting."

528
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:17,752
因此，它将是。
"卡拉曼和他的宝藏..."
So it would be,
"Kalaman and his treasure..."

529
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:22,356
然后还有一些缺失的部分，然后 "休息"，"休息"。
And then there are some missing pieces, and then "rest," "resting,"

530
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,926
和一些关于
"眼泪"，所以...
and something about
"tears," so...

531
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:28,697
在哪里休息？
Resting where?

532
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,997
嗯？哦!
Hmm? Oh!

533
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,866
没说。它没有说。
Didn't say. It doesn't say.

534
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:37,204
塞奇小姐，我需要你做得更好。
Miss Sage, I need you to do better.

535
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:40,809
那么下一次也许不要绑架一个浪漫小说家，嗯？
Then next time maybe don't kidnap a romance novelist, hmm?

536
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:43,110
我的上帝，这不应该是这么难的事！"。
My God, this shouldn't be this hard!

537
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:45,145
我们要找的不是什么贫民的坟墓。
It is not some pauper's grave we're looking for.

538
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,515
它是一个伟大人物的纪念碑!
It is a monument to a great man!

539
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,551
卡拉曼国王很有野心，他很强大。
King Kalaman was ambitious, he was powerful,

540
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:52,119
他是第一个在大西洋建造城市的人。
he was the first man to build a city in the Atlantic.

541
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,888
他的臣民的眼睛会转向他。
The eyes of his subjects would have turned to him.

542
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:58,158
他本来会有一个金字塔，一个紫金塔，一个高塔
He would have had a pyramid, a ziggurat, a tower

543
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,227
来持有他的火之冠。
to hold his Crown of Fire.

544
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,297
我所需要知道的是它在哪里。
All I need to know is where it is.

545
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,601
我不知道你是否记得，但你只说了翻译一下。
I don't know if you recall, but you only said translate it.

546
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:08,869
我-我翻译了它。
I-I translated it.

547
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:11,305
再翻译一下。
Translate it again.

548
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,913
有一天，我们会笑着谈论这个问题。
One day, we're gonna laugh about this.

549
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,216
我们正在进行这样的冒险。
Such an adventure we're having.

550
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:29,657
我应该和你一起去，只是为了做后援，也是为了让你感到可怕。
I should go with you, just for backup and awesomeness.

551
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,226
这是很了不起的。
This is pretty awesome.

552
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,028
你得到了自然，广播。
You got nature, the radio.

553
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,768
是的，你是对的，但它对我非常非常重要。
Yeah, you're right, but it's very, very important to me

554
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,736
她知道我是来救她的。
that she knows that I came to rescue her.

555
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,605
为什么？你喜欢这个女人吗？
Why? Do you like this woman?

556
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:46,741
不，我只是带了零食之类的东西。
No, I just brought snacks and stuff.

557
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,009
而且她饿的时候会变得有点暴躁。
And she gets a little grumpy when she's hungry.

558
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:52,547
血压下降。我明白这一点，因为我是一个每天吃五顿饭的人。
Blood pressure drops. And I get that because I'm a five-meal-a-day kind of guy.

559
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,416
顺便问一下，你是酮类吗？你看起来像酮症患者。
Do you keto, by the way? You look like you keto.

560
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,184
- 没有。
- 不，是的。
- No.
- No. Yeah.

561
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:59,019
你不需要它。
You don't need it.

562
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:00,588
它是什么？
What is it?

563
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:04,291
我只是想让她把我当成不仅仅是一个封面模特。
I just want her to think of me as more than a cover model.

564
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:08,630
但是，艾伦，你是如此之多。你是我的守望者。
But, Alan, you are so much more. You're my lookout.

565
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:12,099
好吧，我至少可以做我把她放进车里的那部分吗？
Okay, can I at least do the part where I put her in the car

566
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:16,003
而我只是去。
"嘘，你现在安全了"？
and I just go,
"Shh. You're safe now"?

567
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,039
当然，冠军。她会喜欢这个的。
Sure, champ. She'll love that.

568
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:21,008
哦，你就这么走了？要开始了？
Oh, you're just going? Going to start?

569
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,578
你现在开始执行任务了？好的。
You're starting the mission now? Okay.

570
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:50,003
哦!
Oh!

571
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,414
去睡觉吧。
Go to sleep.

572
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,410
- 阿兰。
- 什么？
- Alan.
- What?

573
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:32,279
这是对信任的破坏，艾伦。
This is a breach of trust, Alan.

574
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:33,915
我可以帮忙。让我帮忙。
I can help. Let me help.

575
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,020
保持亲密。保持活力。
Stay close. Stay alive.

576
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:46,126
嘿。
Hey.

577
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,567
去睡觉吧。
Go to sleep.

578
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:59,039
我得到了他的头。我怎么处理他的头？我只是要把他放下来。
I got his head. What do I do with his head? I'm just gonna set him down.

579
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:06,413
没有。
No.

580
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:08,115
嘿，嘿，不！
Hey, hey, no!

581
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:09,449
不，不，不!
No, no, no!

582
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:18,826
哦，是的！哦。
Ooh, yeah! Ooh.

583
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,894
嗷嗷叫。
Ow.

584
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,529
团队合作，是的!
Teamwork, yeah!

585
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:24,966
伟大的努力，艾伦，但那个人已经失去了意识。
Great effort, Alan, but that man was already unconscious.

586
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:26,801
我已经上紧了发条。
I was already wound up.

587
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:30,505
只要不在我的时候做...
Just don't do it when I'm...

588
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:34,842
你好。
Hi.

589
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,813
哦!
Oh!

590
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,716
在你的七号！
On your seven!

591
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:47,722
哦!
Oh!

592
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,428
训练师，他没有睡着！
Trainer, he's not asleep!

593
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:56,698
留下来...趴着别动。躺下。
Stay... Stay down. Stay down.

594
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,836
- 你做得很好。
- 谢谢。
- You're doing great.
- Thanks.

595
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,504
你要去哪里？
Where you going?

596
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,943
什么？
What?

597
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:13,113
洛雷塔-塞奇？
Loretta Sage?

598
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:14,348
是的。
Yes.

599
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:16,383
我要带你离开这里。
I'm getting you out of here.

600
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:20,454
- 你为什么这么英俊？
- 我父亲是一名气象员。
- Why are you so handsome?
- My dad was a weatherman.

601
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:23,423
A-Alan?
A-Alan?

602
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:25,560
- 是的。
- 你在这里做什么？
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

603
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:28,495
- 呃，不管怎么说，我是来救你的。
- 这并不是...
- Uh, irregardless, I'm here to save you.
- That's not...

604
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,898
- 我想他的意思是 "无论如何"。
- 是的。
- I think he meant "regardless."
- Yes.

605
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:36,203
哦，呃，她在那里需要拯救吗，训练师？我认为她在那里很好。
Ooh, uh, does she need saving in there, Trainer? I think she's fine there.

606
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:39,574
不，不，离开它。不要拿他们的东西。他们会来找我们的。
No, no, leave it. Don't take their stuff. They'll come after us.

607
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,711
艾伦，你为什么一直这样做？
Alan, why do you keep doing that?

608
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:45,780
你为什么一直这样做？我有那个。
Why do you keep doing that? I had that one.

609
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:48,415
现在只是变得刻薄了。这是不必要的。
It's just getting mean now. It's unnecessary.

610
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:50,250
我很抱歉。我只是想弄一个进去。
I'm sorry. I just wanted to get one in.

611
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:53,453
- 请原谅我。能否将我从椅子上移开？
- 没有时间。
- Excuse me. Would it be possible to remove me from the chair?
- No time.

612
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:55,923
没有时间？已经有这么多闲聊了。
No time? There's been so much chitchat.

613
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:57,324
我们肯定应该去。
We should definitely go.

614
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:59,060
我们走吧!我们走吧！
Let's go! Let's go!

615
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:26,087
为什么事情会发生爆炸？
Why are things exploding?

616
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:34,862
我得到...
I got...

617
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:37,732
好的。
Okay.

618
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:39,867
嘘...
Shh...

619
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,869
嘘。你现在安全了。
Shh. You're safe now.

620
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:43,104
你是...
You're...

621
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:45,338
怎么...你怎么会这么冷静？
How... How are you so calm?

622
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,975
- 那是我的...那是我的台词。
- 在这里。
- That was my... That was my line.
- Here.

623
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:51,946
- 什么？
- 那是灵气吗？
- What?
- Is that Reiki?

624
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,515
- 你在医治我吗？
- 我想是的。
- Are you healing me?
- I think so.

625
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:57,752
- 啊。
- 正如老子所言："致虚极，以静制动"。
- Ah.
- As Laozi says, "To the mind that is still..."

626
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,788
- "......整个宇宙都臣服了。"
- 嘿，是的，我知道一些...
- "...the whole universe surrenders."
- Hey, yeah, I know some...

627
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,725
我知道一些......嗯......名言，可能对这个时刻有好处。
I know some, um, quotes that could be good for this moment.

628
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:05,593
<i>In omnia paratus.</i>。
In omnia paratus.

629
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,261
"准备好做任何事。"
"Ready for anything."

630
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,032
也许我们不应该只是深情地凝视着对方的眼睛
Maybe we shouldn't be just staring lovingly into each other's eyes

631
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:14,669
就像你要坠入爱河，就像我不在这里。
like you're gonna fall in love like I'm not here.

632
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,137
你是谁？
Who are you?

633
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:18,940
只是一个试图做他的工作的人。
Just a guy trying to do his job.

634
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:21,909
而现在，这项工作就是要让这位可爱的女士...
And right now, that job is to get this lovely lady...

635
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:24,212
噢，噢。
Oh! Oh.

636
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:26,246
哦，上帝。好的。
Oh, God. Okay.

637
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,650
不，发生了什么事？
No. What is happening?

638
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:35,056
好的。我们该怎么做？
Okay. What do we do?

639
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:37,257
我们需要做的是...我看不出来。
We need to do... I can't see.

640
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,793
我不喜欢这样!
I don't like it!

641
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,360
在这里。在这里!
Here. Here!

642
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:42,964
- 你为什么要扔枪？
- 真的吗？
- Why would you throw a gun?
- Seriously?

643
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:47,135
- 让我从椅子上下来。
- 我不能。我们没有时间了。
- Get me out of the chair.
- I can't. We don't have time.

644
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:52,740
得挤一挤!你得做个凯格尔运动或什么的!
Gotta squeeze! You got to do a Kegel or something!

645
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:55,243
- 凯格尔吧!
- 你认为凯格尔是什么？
- Kegel it!
- What do you think a Kegel is?

646
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,645
我不在其中，不在!还是不在！
I'm not in it, not in! Still not in!

647
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:00,148
- 你得多进去看看。
- 停止。停下来。停止吧！
- You got to go in more.
- Stop. Stop. Stop it!

648
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,216
噢，噢，噢!
Oh, oh, oh!

649
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,887
哦，上帝。快上车，快上车！发动汽车！发动汽车！
Oh, God. Get in the car, get in the car! Start the car! Start the car!

650
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,287
- 走，走。
- 移动你的腿。
- Go, go.
- Move your leg.

651
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,757
- 哪一个？
- 两个人都是！快走！
- Which one?
- Both of them! Move them!

652
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,428
- 前进，前进!
- 好的。好的。
- Forward, forward!
- Okay. Okay.

653
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:19,901
- 我去！我去！我去我要走了！好的！
- 开车!
- I'm going! I'm going! Okay!
- Drive!

654
00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:24,672
嘘。你现在安全了。嘘。
Shh. You're safe now. Shh.

655
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,642
嗷嗷叫。
Ow.

656
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:29,911
- 嘘。你现在安全了。
- 不，我不是。不安全。
- Shh. You're safe now.
- No, I'm not. Not safe.

657
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,746
哦，不，我在流血吗？
Oh, no, am I bleeding?

658
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,882
- 我不认为这是你的。
- 哦，不，那是很多的血。
- I don't think that's yours.
- Oh, no, that's a lot of blood.

659
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,052
奶酪和米饭!
Cheese and rice!

660
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:39,620
- 那些是他的大脑吗？
- 什么？
- Are those his brains?
- What?

661
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,722
我想他的大脑在我的脸上!
I think his brains are on my face!

662
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:45,425
肯定是他的大脑在我嘴里。我可以品尝到他的思想!
Definitely his brains are in my mouth. I can taste his thoughts!

663
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,727
专注于道路。
Focus on the road.

664
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:48,963
他只是喜欢训练人。训练者。
He just liked training people. Trainer.

665
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:51,933
- 你在说什么呢？
- 他爱我。
- What are you talking about?
- He loved me.

666
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:54,635
你能把车舀到左边去吗？
Can you just scooch the car over to the left?

667
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:58,405
- 把它拿掉。把它弄下来。
- 哦，上帝。
- Get it off. Get it off.
- Oh, God.

668
00:38:58,539 --> 00:38:59,841
小心点!
Watch out!

669
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:06,914
噢，噢，噢，噢
Oh! Oh! Oh!

670
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:10,985
哦，你有没有看到...
Oh, did you see...

671
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:14,989
没有。
No.

672
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:21,729
哦。
Oh.

673
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:25,498
哦，不。哦，不。
Oh, no. Oh, no.

674
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,535
哦，不。
Oh, no.

675
00:39:35,943 --> 00:39:37,477
哦，不。
Oh, no.

676
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:39,914
阿兰?
Alan?

677
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,651
哦，神圣的圣诞节。你还好吗？你还好吗？
Oh, holy Christmas. Are you okay? Are you okay?

678
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,853
你认为你能把我从这里弄出去吗？
Do you think you could get me out of here?

679
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:47,487
是的。好的。
Yeah. Okay.

680
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:50,490
- 你刚从车里飞了出来。
- 我做到了。我确实做到了。
- You just flew out of the car.
- I did. I did, indeed.

681
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,026
好的，我抓住你了。我得到了你。
Okay. I got you. I got you.

682
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,595
你能把我从椅子上弄下来吗？把我从椅子上弄下来。
Can you get me out of the chair? Get me out of the chair.

683
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:56,597
你是对的。你是对的。你是对的。
You're right. You're right. You're right.

684
00:39:57,899 --> 00:39:59,700
- 那是...那是锉钉机吗？
- 是的。
- Is that... Is that a nail filer?
- Yeah.

685
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,269
- 你可以直接撕掉它吗？
- 它正在发挥作用。
- Can you just rip it?
- It's working.

686
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,204
也许下一次我会向你扔出一把枪。
And maybe next time I toss a gun at you,

687
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:05,172
你可以抓住它，而不是躲避。
you can catch it instead of ducking.

688
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:08,509
下次你向我扔枪的时候，说 "嘿，艾伦，接住 "怎么样？
How about the next time you toss a gun at me, you say, "Hey, Alan, catch"?

689
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:10,477
那么，也许在你扔掉它之前，先做这个？
Then maybe do that before you throw it?

690
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,713
嗯，"这里 "是 "抓住 "的同义词。
Well, "here" is a synonym for "catch."

691
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,348
不，"这里 "不是 "抓住 "的肉桂。
No, "here" is not a cinnamon for "catch."

692
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:16,517
以一种口语化的方式，是的，它是。
In a colloquial kind of way, yes, it is.

693
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,719
你说，"给，"我扔给你一件运动衫。
You say, "Here," I toss you a sweatshirt.

694
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,821
你说，"给，"我扔给你一支笔。
You say, "Here," I toss you a pen.

695
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:23,958
如何'bout只是。
"嘿，接住！枪！"
How 'bout just,
"Hey! Catch! Gun!"

696
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:27,094
你想扔的任何东西，我都会接住，因为你说过，"接住"。
Anything that you want to throw, I'll catch it because you said, "Catch."

697
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,963
而且我会抓住它，因为你说了。
And I'll catch it because you said it.

698
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,498
这也是一种选择，然后我们会带着枪。
That is also an option, and then we would have a gun with us.

699
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:32,700
这是个问题。
That's a thing.

700
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,102
- 要小心。
- 好的，我们需要打电话给...
- Be careful.
- Okay, we need to call...

701
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:36,837
要小心。
Be careful.

702
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:39,472
我们需要打电话寻求帮助，去机场，然后离开这里。
We need to call for help, get to the airport and get out of here.

703
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,676
- 而我正在开车。
- 好的。
- And I am driving.
- Okay.

704
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,747
哦。哦。哦，哦，哦，哦!
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

705
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,726
好吧，叫......叫人帮忙。
Okay, call for... call for help.

706
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,695
你的手机呢？
Where's your phone?

707
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:05,099
好的。
Okay.

708
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:11,539
- 告诉我你抓住了他们。
- 我标记了那个金发的。
- Tell me you caught them.
- I tagged the blond one.

709
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:16,010
哦，洛雷塔。
Oh, Loretta.

710
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,179
你在想什么？
What are you thinking?

711
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,382
你可能已经杀了他们中的一个，但他的伙伴还在她身边。
You might've killed one of them, but his partner's still with her.

712
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:25,219
而且他显然是熟练的，受过高度训练的
And he is clearly skilled, highly trained

713
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,888
而且非常危险。
and very dangerous.

714
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:41,702
所以，塞奇小姐说她要离开这个活动。
So, Miss Sage said she was gonna leave the event,

715
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:46,440
然后上了一辆车，离开了活动现场？
then got in a car and left the event?

716
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:49,310
- 你试着给她打电话了吗？
- 她没有带手机。
- Did you try calling her?
- She doesn't have her phone.

717
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:50,811
- 被盗的手机。
- 没有这样说。
- Stolen phone.
- Didn't say that.

718
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:52,680
我的放大镜在哪里？
Where's my magnifier?

719
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:54,749
听着，请你帮帮娜娜好吗？
Listen, can you please help with Nana?

720
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:57,184
我不想让她听到洛雷塔的事情
因为这将使她不安。
I don't want her hearing about Loretta
'cause it's going to upset her.

721
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:00,388
- 洛雷塔怎么样了？
- 没什么，娜娜。她只是去旅行了。
- What about Loretta?
- Nothing, Nana. She just went on a trip.

722
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:01,756
- 很好。
- 是的。
- Good.
- Yeah.

723
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,358
那个女孩需要走出家门。
That girl needed to get out of the house.

724
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:08,562
所以，事情是这样的。Loretta的手机没有被偷。我拿了它。
So, this is the thing. Loretta's phone is not stolen. I took it.

725
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:13,134
我把它给了艾伦。然后艾伦把它交给了训练师，呃，杰克-训练师。
I gave it to Alan. Alan then gave it to the trainer, uh, Jack Trainer.

726
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:15,536
而这就是我们发现她的可穿戴性的原因。
And that is how we found her wearable.

727
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,304
- 那么谁是艾伦？
- 潇洒。
- And who's Alan?
- Dash.

728
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:20,307
- 那是什么？
- 他是她所有书中的英雄。
- What's that?
- He's the hero in all of her books.

729
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:23,411
- 娜娜。嘿，荡妇。
- 嗯，嗯，嗯。
- Nana. Hey, slut.
- Mm-mmm.

730
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:26,447
让我们到另一个房间去，谈谈你经历的哪场战争。
Let's go in the other room and talk about whichever war you lived through.

731
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,717
好的。来吧，会很有趣的。我很抱歉。这将是有趣的。
Okay. Come on, it'll be fun. I'm sorry. It'll be fun.

732
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,719
听着，洛雷塔-塞奇失踪了。
Listen, Loretta Sage is missing.

733
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:34,055
当我看她的智能手表时，它说她已经飞过了
When I looked at her smartwatch, it said that she had flown

734
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:35,856
到某个我从未听说过的岛屿。
to some island I've never even heard about.

735
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,625
这意味着你们都需要为此做些什么。
That means y'all need to do something about this.

736
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:40,127
如果你做不到，我会的，这对你来说不是好事。
And if you can't, I will, and that won't look good for you.

737
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:42,963
很确定这不属于我们的管辖范围。
Pretty sure that's outside our jurisdiction.

738
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:46,100
- 你必须给联邦调查局打电话。
- 好的。
- You'd have to call the Feds.
- Okay.

739
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:48,602
如果你真的去找联邦调查局，帮我说说好话。
And if you do go to the Feds, put in a good word for me.

740
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:51,172
- 对我来说。
- 对我们来说。
- For me.
- For us.

741
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,245
噢，噢。
Oh, oh.

742
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:07,488
你打算怎么做，把车重新组装起来吗？
What are you gonna do, put the car back together?

743
00:43:07,621 --> 00:43:09,857
嗯...我们可以...
Well... we could...

744
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:28,442
- 你说电话在哪里？
- 乘客手套。
- Where did you say the phone was?
- Passenger glove.

745
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:30,311
- 什么？
- 乘客手套箱。
- What?
- Passenger glove compartment.

746
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,679
善哉，善哉。
Goodness.

747
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,248
哦，我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

748
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:36,617
哦，我的上帝。没有电话，没有车。我们会死在外面...
Oh, my God. No phone, no car. We're so gonna die out...

749
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,452
- 在这里。
- 这是什么？
- Here.
- What is this?

750
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:40,254
丛林中的靴子。
Boots for the jungle.

751
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:42,890
这并不完全是登山靴，但...
It's not exactly hiking boots, but...

752
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:45,626
我想，穿了这么久的高跟鞋，你的脚会很难受。
I figured your feet would be killing you after wearing heels for this long.

753
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:48,162
这是我们能做的最好的了。它们是艾莉森的。对不起。
It was the best we could do. They're Allison's. Sorry.

754
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:50,965
哦。好的，好的，谢谢你。
Oh. Okay, well, thank you.

755
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:52,867
在这里，哦，我给你带来了奶酪。
Here, oh, I got you cheese.

756
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,802
- 哦，我的上帝。
- 你必须保持水分充足。
- Oh, my God.
- You got to stay hydrated.

757
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:56,804
- 非常感谢你。
- 他们没有玻璃瓶。
- Thank you so much.
- They didn't have glass bottles,

758
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:58,973
所以我们一定会保留它并回收利用。
so we'll definitely hold onto it and recycle.

759
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:06,180
好的，所以我们需要做的是找到一个电话，我们需要给当局打电话。
Okay, so what we need to do is find a phone, we need to call the authorities,

760
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:09,183
而我们需要在这里等待，直到有人来救我们。
and we need to wait here until somebody comes and rescues us.

761
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:12,820
呃......这......这就是救援。
Uh... This... This is the rescue.

762
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,188
没有其他人会来。
No one else is coming.

763
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,290
- 你说什么？
- 我是救援。
- I'm sorry?
- I'm the rescue.

764
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:19,326
原本只有我一个人，后来我想，Trainer应该来。
It was originally just gonna be me, then I was like, Trainer should come.

765
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,128
哦，训练师。安息吧。
Oh, Trainer. Rest in peace.

766
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:25,466
所以，我们最好的办法是去机场。看到这条道路了吗？
So, our best bet is to get to the airport. See this road right here?

767
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,302
从这个区域，只要走一条捷径，穿过丛林就能到达公路。
From this area, just take a shortcut through the jungle to the road.

768
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,304
你刚才说 "穿越丛林的捷径 "吗？
Did you just say "shortcut through the jungle"?

769
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:31,939
- 是的。
- 好了，你看到我们了吗？
- Yeah.
- Okay, do you see us?

770
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:34,576
- 嗯，嗯。
- 你不是Dash，我也不是Lovemore。好吗？
- Uh-huh.
- You are not Dash, and I'm not Lovemore. Okay?

771
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,076
我是洛雷塔，你是艾伦。
I'm Loretta, and you are Alan.

772
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,479
- 而丛林会吃掉像我们这样的人，好吗？
- 吃人。
- And jungles eat people like us, okay?
- Eat people.

773
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:41,916
而且我不想把连衣裙弄脏。它是借来的。所以我们要留在原地。
And I don't want to mess up the jumpsuit. It's on loan. So we're gonna stay put.

774
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,951
我们不会只是站在这里，好吗？
We're not just gonna stand around here, okay?

775
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:45,419
我们要穿过丛林。
We're gonna go through the jungle,

776
00:44:45,554 --> 00:44:47,622
我们要去机场找一个电话。
we're gonna go to the airport and find a phone,

777
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:50,758
- 因此，你可以拥有你的蛋糕并得到你想要的东西。
- "也要吃"？
- so you can have your cake and get what you want.
- "And eat it too"?

778
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:53,294
如果这就是你想做的蛋糕，很好。我们走吧。
If that's what you want to do with your cake, fine. Let's go.

779
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:55,329
- 这是你对蛋糕做的唯一一件事。
- 不是我的。
- That's the only thing you do with cake.
- Not mine.

780
00:44:55,462 --> 00:44:57,831
我不知道你的人是怎么做的，但我的人吃这个。
I don't know what your people do, but my people eat it.

781
00:44:57,965 --> 00:45:00,167
你可以把它作为礼物送给别人。
You could give it to someone as a gift.

782
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,504
那些人还是要吃蛋糕的。
Those people are still going to eat the cake.

783
00:45:02,637 --> 00:45:04,205
每个人都在吃蛋糕。
Everybody eats cake.

784
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:06,073
那人们跳出来的那种呢？
What about the kind people jump out of?

785
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:09,176
- 他们不吃，当他们在里面。
- 哦，我的上帝。
- They don't eat it, when they're in it.
- Oh, my God.

786
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,037
他们绑架你到底是为了什么？
What did they kidnap you for anyhow?

787
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,006
是像<i>Taken那样的一些奇怪的性的东西吗？</i>。
Is it some weird sex stuff like Taken?

788
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,642
哦，我的上帝，谢谢你。
Oh, my God, thank you.

789
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:43,511
我也这么想，但这家伙是费尔法克斯家族的一员。
I thought so too, but the guy's one of the Fairfaxes.

790
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:45,412
- 贝弗利？
- 不，是老的那个。
- Beverly?
- No, the older one.

791
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:48,949
真正奇怪的是，有关于寻找蒙特祖玛宝藏的视频日志。
The really odd one that had the vlog on finding Montezuma's treasure.

792
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,485
那个因试图抬高泰坦尼克号而上新闻的家伙？
The dude that was on the news for trying to raise the Titanic?

793
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,387
是的，他在寻找 "火之冠"。
Yes, he's looking for the Crown of Fire.

794
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:57,391
等一下。像真正的火之冠？就像那个...
Wait a minute. Like the actual Crown of Fire? Like the one...

795
00:45:57,525 --> 00:46:00,861
- 所以那些废墟是...
- 他们是失落的D城，没错。
- So those ruins were...
- They were the Lost City of D, yes.

796
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:03,330
- 什么？你现在是在跟我开玩笑吗？
- 嘘。
- What? Are you kidding me right now?
- Shh.

797
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:04,865
这就像你的书。
This is like your book.

798
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:07,801
所以我们现在基本上是在进行Lovemore和Dash的冒险？
So we're basically on a Lovemore and Dash adventure right now?

799
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,903
那是什么？
What is that?

800
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:12,507
如果费尔法克斯真的找到了王冠呢？
What if Fairfax actually finds the crown?

801
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:13,974
他不会的。他不会的。
He won't. He won't.

802
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:17,244
- 我们要去哪里？
- 呃...
- Where do we go?
- Uh...

803
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:19,380
噢，噢，噢。
Oh, oh, oh.

804
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,552
好吧，呃，我们需要下水。
Okay, uh, we need to get in the water.

805
00:46:24,686 --> 00:46:26,755
- 什......什么？
- 我们需要走河道。
- W-What?
- We need to go by river.

806
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:28,657
不，不，我并不真的做水。
No, no, I don't really do water.

807
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,125
你是什么意思，"做水"？我没有要求你用它来生育。
What do you mean, "do water"? I'm not asking you to procreate with it.

808
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:33,662
呃，我的身体和水其实并不相配。
Uh, my body and water don't really go together.

809
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:36,163
你对死亡有什么感觉？哦，上帝。
How do you feel about dying? Oh, God.

810
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:38,132
嘿，哇，哇，哇。你很好。你没事了。
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're okay. You're okay.

811
00:46:38,265 --> 00:46:41,068
- 我得到了你。很好。
- 我会游泳。我会游泳。非常感谢你。
- I got you. Fine.
- I can swim. I can swim. Thank you very much.

812
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:43,237
- 你要去哪里？
- 我正在穿越。
- Where are you going?
- I'm crossing.

813
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,306
不，我们必须呆在水里。
No, we have to stay in the water.

814
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:47,875
我为我的书<i>《灌木丛中的一年》研究了水生动物的反跟踪。<i>。
I researched aquatic counter-tracking for my book, A Year in the Bush.

815
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,977
他们会在水中失去我们的踪迹。
They'll lose our tracks in the water.

816
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,880
为什么这里很温暖？等等，你在撒尿吗？
Why is it warm here? Wait, are you peeing?

817
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:54,982
绕过它就可以了。
Just go around it.

818
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:25,245
好吧，我想...
Okay, I think...

819
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:27,247
我想我们失去了他们，对吗？
I think we lost them, right?

820
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:30,384
是的。这还不算太糟。是的。
Yeah. That wasn't so bad. Yeah.

821
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:32,119
好的，呃...
Okay, uh...

822
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:34,656
- 不要惊慌。
- 你是什么意思，不要惊慌？
- Don't panic.
- What do you mean, don't panic?

823
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:35,989
- 只是不要惊慌。
- 没有。
- Just don't panic.
- No.

824
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:37,858
不要再说 "恐慌 "了。我现在就很恐慌。
Stop saying "panic." I'm panicking now.

825
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:39,860
你的背上有东西。
You have something on your back.

826
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:42,129
不!
No!

827
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:43,732
- 不要再叫了。
- 那是什么？
- Stop screaming.
- What is that?

828
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,065
- 那是什么？
- 不要再叫了。
- What is that?
- Stop screaming.

829
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,634
- 你身上有吗？
- 不，不。
- Do you have any on you?
- No. No.

830
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:48,168
为什么你身上没有任何东西？
Why don't you have any on you?

831
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:50,070
也许那件连体服把他们吓跑了。我不知道。
Maybe the jumpsuit scared them off. I don't know.

832
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,673
- 把他们赶走。
- 哦，我的上帝。
- Get 'em off.
- Oh, my God.

833
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:54,308
好吧。不，我不能碰那些充血的粘液袋。
Okay. No, I can't touch those blood-gorged mucous sacks.

834
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:55,810
- 你能甩掉它吗？
- 就在此时。
- Can you fling it?
- Right now.

835
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:57,277
- 得到它。
- 只要把它捡起来扔出去就可以了。
- Get it.
- Just pick it and fling it.

836
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:59,279
- 只要把它捡起来扔出去就可以了。
- 你把它捡起来，然后把它扔出去!
- Just pick it and fling it.
- You pick it and fling it!

837
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,448
- 你能把它转出去吗？
- 请把它拿下来。
- Can you spin it off?
- Please, get it off.

838
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,585
我不喜欢碰它。我觉得很晕。
I don't like touching it. I'm feeling faint.

839
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:06,821
- 他们正在吸走我的灵魂。
- 好了，好了。停，停，停。
- They're sucking my soul out.
- Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

840
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,759
不要发出这种声音。
Don't make that sound.

841
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:15,830
他们有多少人？
How many of them are there?

842
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:17,431
哦，没有多少。
Oh, there's not many.

843
00:48:17,565 --> 00:48:19,567
- 感觉有这么多。
- 你是什么...
- It feels like there's so many.
- What are you...

844
00:48:19,701 --> 00:48:20,968
- 我觉得有很多。
- 哦!
- I feel so many.
- Oh!

845
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:23,605
- 圣母玛利亚!
- 你为什么要祈祷？
- Holy mother of God!
- Why are you praying?

846
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:26,775
有那么糟糕吗？不可能那么糟糕。有那么糟糕吗？有多少？
Is it that bad? It can't be that bad. Is it that bad? How many?

847
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:28,108
这不是很好。
It's not great.

848
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:29,844
他们要把我的每一点都吸出来。
They're gonna suck every bit of me out.

849
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:32,647
请不要再说了。我只是需要......需要变得低调。
Just please stop speaking. I just need to... need to get low.

850
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:34,448
稍等一下。
Hold on a second.

851
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:37,351
哦，上帝！我可以感觉到它们...我能感觉到他们只是......他们只是在吸出这么多。
Oh, God! I can feel them just... they're just sucking out so much.

852
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:40,320
当他们完成后，我将会像一个干瘪的皮囊。
I'm gonna be like a shriveled-up skin sack when they're done.

853
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:42,423
你不能告诉我爸爸我是这样死的，好吗？
You cannot tell my dad I died this way, okay?

854
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:46,561
你得告诉他我在用剑和巨蟒搏斗之类的。
You gotta tell him I was wrestling an anaconda with a sword or something.

855
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:49,463
我就像一个血色的Jamba Juice。他们只是把它全部吸出来。
I'm like a blood Jamba Juice. They're just sucking it all out.

856
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:51,198
但为什么它们都在我的屁股上？
Why are they all on my butt though?

857
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:53,934
有点像从我的凯撒沙拉上摘下鳀鱼。
Kind of like picking anchovies off my Caesar salad.

858
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:55,703
- 实际上，这并不那么糟糕。
- 鳀鱼？
- It's actually not so bad.
- Anchovies?

859
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:57,371
你现在为什么要去找食物？
Why do you go to food right now?

860
00:48:57,505 --> 00:49:00,340
只要找到女王，我们就可以结束这一切了。
Just find the queen, and let's be done with this.

861
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:02,811
我认为你很好。我需要检查一下你的前面。
Think you're good. I need to just check your front.

862
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,212
好吧，我不能看。
Okay. I can't look.

863
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:08,716
它不好吗？
Is it bad?

864
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,920
- 呃，哇。
- 它是什么？就说出来吧。
- Uh, wow.
- What is it? Just say it.

865
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:15,389
我的意思是，你期望它，你知道，不...
I mean, you expect it to, you know, not...

866
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:18,225
然后突然出现了，而且是，呃......。
Then suddenly there it is, and it is, uh...

867
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:20,562
- 你知道，你为一个人感到兴奋。
- 什么？
- You know, you get excited for a person.
- What?

868
00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:23,297
- 我的意思是，我为所有的人感到兴奋。
- 你为什么会兴奋？
- I mean, I'm excited for all people.
- Why are you excited?

869
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,733
嗯，你知道，人们想知道，他们想知道。
Well, you know, people wonder, they wonder,

870
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,434
但他们不知道，对吗？
but they don't know, right?

871
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:30,003
他们不知道，直到他们突然知道。
They don't, until suddenly they do know,

872
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:34,441
然后他们......他们知道一些以前不知道的事情。
and then they... they know something that wasn't known before.

873
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:36,410
只是...我到底有没有水蛭？
Just... Do I have any leeches or not?

874
00:49:36,544 --> 00:49:40,648
哦，你那勇敢的战士悬挂在宁静的孤独中。
Oh, your plucky warrior hangs in tranquil solitude.

875
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:41,850
什么？
What?

876
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:44,184
不，你很好。你很好。
No, you're good. You're good.

877
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:46,987
我们当时是如此的勇敢。
We were so brave just then.

878
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,389
为什么他们要这么多地去找屁股？
Why do they go for the butt so much?

879
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:13,480
你唱的那首歌是什么？
What's that song you're singing?

880
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:16,651
当我还是个孩子时，我的<i>abbi</i>经常给我唱的一首歌。
A song my abbi used to sing to me when I was a kid.

881
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:20,254
- "如果你从岛上吸食生命...
- 是吗？
- "If you suck life from the island...
- Yeah?

882
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:23,156
......这个岛会吸走你的。"
...the island will suck of you."

883
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:27,194
你奶奶给你唱过关于被小岛吸走的歌？
Your grandma sang you songs about getting sucked off by an island?

884
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:29,697
它并没有翻译得超级好。
It doesn't translate super well.

885
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:33,367
幻影水蛭综合症，就像，一个东西？
Is phantom leech syndrome, like, a thing?

886
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,537
他们不下蛋，是吗？
They don't lay eggs, do they?

887
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:25,853
塔哈女王？
Queen Taha?

888
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:43,838
"卡拉曼国王和他的宝藏得到安息......
"King Kalaman and his treasure laid to rest...

889
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:48,375
躺在无尽的泪水之井中安息。
laid to rest in the well of endless tears.

890
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:50,410
躺在无尽的泪水之井中安息。"
Laid to rest in the well of endless tears."

891
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:52,479
- 那是什么意思？
- 洛雷塔!
- What does that mean?
- Loretta!

892
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:54,816
你让我心脏病发作。
You gave me a heart attack.

893
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:57,150
你去哪里了？
Where'd you go?

894
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:02,724
这是什么？
What is this?

895
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:06,126
我不确定，但也许他们聚集在这里？
I'm not sure, but maybe they gathered here?

896
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:11,298
你能想象自己就在这里。
Can you imagine being right here,

897
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:14,068
当年就在这个地方？
right in this very spot back then?

898
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:15,870
他们所讲的故事？
The stories that they told?

899
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:18,806
这么多的历史我相信就发生在这里。
So much history I'm sure happened right here.

900
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,479
他们已经把我们逼到了绝境。
They've got us cornered.

901
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:27,247
- 好的。我们得上去了。来吧。
- 什么？
- Okay. We've got to go up. Come on.
- What?

902
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:30,484
你看到我穿什么了吗？我穿着一件闪光的紧身衣。
Have you seen what I'm wearing? I'm in a glitter straitjacket.

903
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:33,554
无处可去，只能往上走。来吧。我们走吧。
There's nowhere to go but up. Come on. Let's go.

904
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:37,257
哦！我不应该这样做。我太老了，不适合做这个。
Oh! I should not be doing this. I'm too old for this.

905
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:38,425
不，你不是。你很美。
No, you're not. You're beautiful.

906
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,193
我没有说我不漂亮。
I didn't say I'm not beautiful.

907
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,162
我说我太老了，不能再这样做了。
I said I'm too old to be doing this.

908
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:45,900
我的技能是坐着思考，在我无法思考的时候吃东西。
My skill is sitting and thinking and eating when I can't think.

909
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:48,435
是的，你绝对可以穿更好的鞋子来做这个。
Yeah, you definitely could be wearing better shoes for this.

910
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:50,437
你给我带来了这双鞋。
You brought me these shoes.

911
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:53,107
我不能再往前走了。我不能再往前走了。
I can't go any further. I can't go any further.

912
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,942
我在这里做得不是很好。
I'm not doing so great here.

913
00:52:55,076 --> 00:52:56,376
你得到了它。来吧。
You got it. Come on.

914
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:58,378
我知道你认为你坚持下去会更安全。
I know you think that you're safer holding on,

915
00:52:58,513 --> 00:52:59,747
但你必须继续前进。
but you have to keep going.

916
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:01,816
- 我不能。我不能，我不能。
- 好吗？
- I can't. I can't, I can't.
- Okay?

917
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:03,985
- 你闻到了吗？
- 闻到什么？
- Do you smell that?
- Smell what?

918
00:53:04,118 --> 00:53:05,853
- 我闻到了什么。
- 它是一个捕食者吗？它是什么？
- I smell something.
- Is it a predator? What is it?

919
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,922
- 下来的层层叠叠的火？
- 你要闻得更深。
- A downward cascading fire?
- You got to smell deeper.

920
00:53:08,056 --> 00:53:09,189
我什么都没闻到！"。
I don't smell anything!

921
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:15,863
大口深呼吸。
Take a big, deep breath.

922
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:17,264
好的。
All right.

923
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:18,966
- 干得好。
- 好的。
- Good job.
- Okay.

924
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,704
- 那是操纵性的。谢谢你。
- 是的，就是这样。
- That was manipulative. Thank you.
- Yeah, it was.

925
00:53:22,837 --> 00:53:25,305
在这里，我们走了。我来帮你一把，好吗？
Here we go. I'm gonna help you out a little bit, all right?

926
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:27,508
- 一、二、三...我们来了！
- 你在做什么？
- One, two, three... Here we go!
- What are you doing?

927
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:28,976
- 离开那里。
- 来吧。
- Get out of there.
- Come on.

928
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,145
- 不，不，不要弯曲。
- 这是我的呼声。
- No, no, don't flex.
- That's my hoo-hoo.

929
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:34,214
只是骑在头上。保持手的动作，骑在头上。
Just ride the head. Keep the hands moving and ride the head.

930
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:35,616
- 哦，上帝。
- 你做得很好。
- Oh, God.
- You're doing great.

931
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,452
对不起，我的头发被刮花了。来吧。
Sorry about the scratchy haircut. Come on.

932
00:53:58,438 --> 00:54:00,742
<i>Dulcius ex asperis.</i>。
Dulcius ex asperis.

933
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:02,677
那是什么？
What was that?

934
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,311
哦，没什么。
Oh, nothing.

935
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:06,614
这只是约翰和我想说的事情
It was just something that John and I would say

936
00:54:06,748 --> 00:54:09,851
在我们完成了一些大的事情之后，比如说一个...
after we finished something big, like a...

937
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:11,919
像考古发掘或手稿一样。
like an archaeological dig or a manuscript.

938
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:15,388
它是拉丁语。它的意思是
"困难之后更甜蜜"。
It's Latin. It means
"sweeter after difficulty."

939
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:17,892
什么是...
What's...

940
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,894
"洛雷塔是个坏蛋 "的拉丁语是什么意思？
What's Latin for "Loretta's a badass"?

941
00:54:20,027 --> 00:54:24,498
我是个坏蛋。我爬上了一座山。
I am a badass. I climbed a mountain.

942
00:54:24,632 --> 00:54:27,568
哦，我的上帝。我希望贝丝能看到我们这么做。
Oh, my God. I wish Beth could've seen us do this.

943
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:30,505
- 哦，上帝。贝丝。
- 不要担心贝丝。
- Oh, God. Beth.
- Don't worry about Beth.

944
00:54:30,638 --> 00:54:34,108
她现在可能让整个海军都在追捕我们。
She's probably got the whole navy after us right now.

945
00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:37,277
<i>我明白，你认为你必须自己到岛上的当局去，</i>。
I get that you think you have to go to the island authorities yourself,

946
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,815
<i>但别担心，我将保持洛雷塔的社交活动超级活跃。</i>。
but don't worry, I'm keeping Loretta's socials super active.

947
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:43,316
<i>刚刚发了推特。
"我刚刚被绑架了吗？"<i>。
Just tweeted,
"Did I just get kidnapped?

948
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,921
<i>#FML，@ShawnMendes。

#FML, @ShawnMendes,
#ShawnMendes."

949
00:54:47,054 --> 00:54:48,689
而你是独自旅行？
And you're traveling alone?

950
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:51,692
是的，我是独自旅行。嗯，嗯。我是单身。
Yes, I'm traveling alone. Mm-hmm. I'm single.

951
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,426
那么这可能会起作用。
Then this might work.

952
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:55,328
- 好的!跟我说说。
- 你会打到纽约。
- Okay! Talk to me.
- You'll hit New York.

953
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:58,933
从那里，你将飞往几内亚，在那里你可以拿起一个水坑的跳板。
From there, you'll fly to Guinea, where you can pick up a puddle jumper.

954
00:54:59,066 --> 00:55:00,134
一个什么？
A what?

955
00:55:01,035 --> 00:55:02,502
- 小飞机。
<i>- 是的，没有腿部空间。</i>。
- Small plane.
- Yeah, no leg room.

956
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:03,805
这很好。我会接受的。
That's fine. I'll take it.

957
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:06,007
- <i>或者你可以直接回家。</i>。
- 谢谢你。
- Or you could just come home.
- Thank you.

958
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:16,316
我们需要一些更易燃的东西。所有东西都是如此潮湿。
We need something more flammable. Everything is just so wet.

959
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:17,952
这里有什么？你的包里有什么？
What's in here? What's in your bag?

960
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,921
- 呃...
- 哦，很多。好的。
- Uh...
- Oh, a lot. Okay.

961
00:55:20,054 --> 00:55:21,454
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

962
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,456
好的。面罩。
Okay. Face masks.

963
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:24,926
是的，这就像一个礼品篮的事情。
Yeah, that was like a gift-basket thing.

964
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:27,028
你带了一根香薰蜡烛到丛林里？
You brought a scented candle into the jungle?

965
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:28,395
这是我妈妈给我的。
My mom gave me that.

966
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,031
这就像母亲节的一个奇怪的礼物。
It was like a weird gift for Mother's Day.

967
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:32,499
你妈妈在母亲节送你礼物？
Your mom gives you gifts for Mother's Day?

968
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:34,569
<i>黑色...</i>

嗯......哦，好的。好的。
Um... Oh, okay. All right.

972

Whoo!是的!
Whoo! Yes!

973
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:45,046
是的，我做了火！我做了火。
Yes, I made fire!

974
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,716
- 那是相当令人印象深刻的。你必须...
- 这是一个美丽的火。
- That's pretty impressive. You have to...
- It is a beautiful fire.

975

谁会想到呢？
Who would have thought?

976
00:55:50,885 --> 00:55:53,386
哦，你只是，嗯，把你的衬衫脱掉？
Oh, you're just, um, taking your shirt off?

977
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:56,423
这看起来真的很不舒服。
That looks really uncomfortable.

978
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:58,425
你还好吗？后面？
Are you okay? The back?

979
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,597
是的。这就是为什么我不做水。
Yeah. That is why I don't do water.

980
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,032
- 好的。
- 我的身体变成了一个八年级学生的脸。
- Okay.
- My body becomes an eighth-grader's face.

981
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:08,002
你有什么治疗方法吗？比如一些药膏之类的？
Do you have anything for it? Like some ointment or something?

982
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:09,971
是的，我有。嗯，我有。
Yeah, I do. Well, I did.

983
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:12,173
它在一个很小很小的瓶子里。
It was in a little, tiny little bottle.

984
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:14,242
它是这样的。我很抱歉。
It was this. I'm sorry.

985
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,376
哦，上帝，我很抱歉。
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

986
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,812
没关系的。
It's okay.

987
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:20,248
- 等一下。是的。来这里。到这里来。
- 什么？
- Hold on. Yes. Come here. Come here.

好的。
Okay.

哦，不，你不必去碰它。没关系的。没事的。
Oh, no, you don't have to touch it. It's okay. It's fine.

993

我触摸了你们充血的袋子，所以......。
I touched your engorged sacks, so...

994
00:56:34,795 --> 00:56:36,496

995
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:39,466
好吧，这可能有点冷。
Okay, this might be a little bit cold.

对不起，对不起，对不起。
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

998

也许这就是小飞应该死的方式。
Maybe this is how Dash should die.

Yeah?

好的，那么。
All right, then.

你会怎么写呢？
How would you write this?

00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,937
景观的轮廓
the contoured scenery

1010
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,672
小飞的身体。
of Dash's body.

1011
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:22,442
熟悉的地形使
Familiar terrain made

1012
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:24,946
新的和令人兴奋的每一个...
new and exciting with every...

1013
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:28,215
与每一个猩红的边缘"。
with every scarlet rim."

1014
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:31,018
而这并没有，呃...
And that didn't, uh...

1015
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:33,321
没有把她关掉？
didn't turn her off?

1016
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:34,689
没有。
No.

1017
00:57:35,488 --> 00:57:37,325
"因为随着每一个心形山脊的出现。
"Because with every cardinal ridge,

1018
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:40,695
洛夫莫尔发现了语言中的另一个字母
Lovemore discovered another letter in the language

1019
00:57:40,828 --> 00:57:42,997
只有他们的身体会说话"。
that only their bodies spoke."

1020
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:46,067
他们的身体又在说什么呢？
And what were their bodies saying?

1021
00:57:48,035 --> 00:57:49,570
"带我去......
"Take me...

1022
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:53,107
带上我。
take me,

1023
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:55,276
带我去。"
take me."

1024
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:56,744
怎么说呢？
How's that?

1025
00:57:57,545 --> 00:57:58,779
这很好。
It was good.

1026
00:57:58,913 --> 00:58:00,614
- 你的背部。我是说，你的背怎么样了？
- 很好。
- Your back. I mean, how is your back?
- Good.

1027
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:02,116
- 好的，你确定？
- 是的。
- Okay. You sure?
- Yeah.

1028
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:06,854
- 我也是指我的背。就在那里，是的。
- 好的。
- I also meant my back. Right there, yeah.
- Okay.

1029
00:58:15,129 --> 00:58:16,163
用品。
Supplies.

1030
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:22,536
好吧，我感到很冷。我想我可能要进去睡一会儿了。
Okay, I'm chilly. I think I'm gonna probably turn in in a little bit.

1031
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,838
- 好的。
- 你还好吗？
- Okay.
- You good?

1032
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:26,607
是的，我是火......很好。我很好。
Yeah, I'm fire... fine. I'm fine.

1033
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:29,710
我不是 "火"。我在火边很好。
I'm not "fire." I'm fine by the fire.

1034
00:58:30,378 --> 00:58:32,113
好的。好的。
Okay. All right.

1035
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:43,257
呃，这取决于你，但如果你很冷。
Uh, it's up to you, but if you're cold,

1036
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:47,661
如果你愿意的话，也许我们都能在这里适应。
maybe we could probably both fit in here, if you wanted to.

1037
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,997
我们两个人？
Both of us?

1038
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:53,167
- 只有当你想这样做的时候。我的意思是，这只是...
- 是的，不，这听起来...
- Only if you want to. I mean, it's just...
- Yeah, no, that sounds...

1039
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,735
呃...
Uh...

1040
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:56,137
好吧，你怎么...
Okay. How do you...

1041
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,205
你可以先走，然后我再想办法。
You can go first, then I'll figure it out.

1042
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:01,442
不，不，你去。这绝对是一个
"女士优先 "类型的情况。
No, no, you go. It's definitely a
"ladies first" type of situation.

1043
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:04,211
- 任何时候都不要将手放在袋子里。
- 这就是我打算做的事。
- Keep hands out of the bag at all times.
- That's what I was gonna do.

1044
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:05,980
- 屁股对屁股。
- 手伸出来，屁股对着屁股。
- Butt to butt.
- Hands out and butt to butt.

1045
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:09,417
- 是的。我是做什么的？
- 刚进去。去吧，坐下。
- Yeah. What do I do?
- Just get in. Go ahead and sit.

1046
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,253
我先坐？好的，我坐。
I sit first? Okay. I'm in.

1047
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:16,323
你太重了。你会把这东西像游轮一样翻过来。
You're too heavy. You're gonna flip this thing like a cruise ship.

1048
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:19,126
你看着自己。坚持住。我不在。
You watch yourself. Hold on. I'm not in.

1049
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,463
为什么这对我的核心有这么大的影响？
Why is this engaging my core so much?

1050
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,099
你怎么会有这种想法呢？
How 'bout you shimmy?

1051
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,334
- 我不能呼吸了。我不呼吸了。
- 你还好吗？
- I can't breathe. I'm not breathing.
- Are you good?

1052
00:59:27,468 --> 00:59:28,803
我的脸。
My face.

1053
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,571
是的。好的。
Yeah. Okay.

1054
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:35,176
手伸出来了。屁股对屁股。
Hands are out. Butt to butt.

1055
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:36,343
好的。
Okay.

1056
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:09,143
好吧!
Well!

1057
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,377
来吧。
Come on.

1058
01:00:10,512 --> 01:00:12,113
来吧!让我们听听吧！
Come on! Let's hear it!

1059
01:00:12,246 --> 01:00:15,716
让我们以热烈的掌声欢迎洛雷塔!
Let's give a nice round of applause to Loretta!

1060
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:17,418
这是她应得的。
She earned it.

1061
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:21,455
一个老年闭门不出的人让你们在丛林里握着你们的小弟弟。
A geriatric shut-in left you holding your dicks in the jungle.

1062
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,923
干得好，洛雷塔。
Good job, Loretta.

1063
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:25,560
老板，别这样。现在人们正在死亡。
Boss, come on. People are dying now.

1064
01:00:25,693 --> 01:00:29,363
你不觉得这一切可能已经走得太远了吗？
Don't you think that maybe this has all gone too far?

1065
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,266
这真的值得吗？
Is it really worth it?

1066
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:35,769
我正处于实现无法实现的目标的边缘。
I am on the cusp of attaining the unattainable.

1067
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:38,873
一些单一的东西，一些没有国家的东西。
Something singular, something no nation,

1068
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:42,577
没有一个皇帝，没有一个眉毛胡子一把抓的兄弟曾经有过。
no emperor, no brownnosing brothers ever have.

1069
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:45,813
传说中的火之冠。
The legendary Crown of Fire.

1070
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,348
所以，是的。
So, yes.

1071
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,783
是的，我肯定会说这是值得的。
Yes, I would definitely say it's worth it.

1072
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:00,995
请原谅我！
Excuse me!

1073
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:04,064
对不起，先生。我需要赶到我的下一个转机航班。
Excuse me, sir. I need to get to my next connecting flight.

1074
01:01:04,198 --> 01:01:05,466
没有飞行。
No flight.

1075
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,135
飞行员生病了。明天来吧。
The pilot is sick. Come tomorrow.

1076
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:10,371
不，不，先生。我明天不能来。我今天需要做这个。
No, no, sir. I cannot come tomorrow. I need to do this today.

1077
01:01:10,505 --> 01:01:15,242
我需要在今晚赶到岛屿Isla Hundida。人命关天。
I need to get to the island Isla Hundida tonight. Lives are at stake.

1078
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:16,877
明天来吧。
Come tomorrow.

1079
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,316
- 对不起，小姐？
- 是吗？
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

1080
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:26,555
我忍不住无意中听到你说你喜欢牛排。
I couldn't help but overhear you say that you like steak.

1081
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:29,924
好吧，这有点疯狂。
Okay, this is a little bit crazy,

1082
01:01:30,057 --> 01:01:31,859
但我也喜欢牛排。
but I also like steak.

1083
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:34,261
- 什么？
- 我也喜欢牛排。
- What?
- I also like steak.

1084
01:01:34,395 --> 01:01:37,831
你是否愿意，也许，我不知道...
Would you like to, maybe, I don't know...

1085
01:01:37,965 --> 01:01:40,768
- 也许有一个...
- 不，"生命受到威胁"。
- Maybe there's a...
- No. "Lives are at stake."

1086
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:42,637
我今晚需要到岛上去。
I need to go to the island tonight.

1087
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,138
- 啊。
- 是的。
- Ah.
- Yes.

1088
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:45,806
- 甚至更严重。
- 极端的。
- Even more serious.
- Extremely.

1089
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,943
好吧，我相信我可能能够帮助你。
Well, I believe that I may be able to assist you.

1090
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,011
我有一架货机。
I have a cargo plane.

1091
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:55,816
也许在我送完货后，我们可以去你的岛上转转。
Maybe after I make my delivery, we could swing by your island.

1092
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,719
我正要问你一些事情，你最好告诉我真相。
I'm about to ask you something, and you better tell me the truth.

1093
01:01:58,852 --> 01:02:00,689
你以前杀过人吗？
Have you ever murdered anyone before?

1094
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:04,158
不!
No!

1095
01:02:07,629 --> 01:02:10,331
我不知道我是否真的相信它，但让我告诉你一些事情。
I don't know if I really buy it, but let me tell you something.

1096
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:14,703
如果你想谋杀我，我保证，我会先谋杀你。
If you ever think about murdering me, I promise, I will murder you first.

1097
01:02:14,835 --> 01:02:16,136
我的荣幸。
My pleasure.

1098
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,439
你很奇怪。我们走吧。
You are weird. Let's go.

1099
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:17,264
"卡拉曼国王和他的财宝在井中安息
"King Kalaman and his treasure laid to rest in the well

1100
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:19,333
无尽的泪水"。
of endless tears."

1101
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,202
那是什么？
What is that?

1102
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:26,775
哦，这是一个......这是一个东西。我的意思是，这不是，呃...
Oh, it's a... it's a thing. I mean, it's not, uh...

1103
01:03:26,907 --> 01:03:29,109
你知道，这不是你想的那样。
You know, it's not what you think it is.

1104
01:03:29,243 --> 01:03:33,013
所以这不是费尔法克斯的古代羊皮纸的碎片？
So it's not Fairfax's fragment of an ancient parchment?

1105
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:36,950
好吧，就是你认为的那样。
Okay. It's what you think it is.

1106
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:38,485
洛雷塔，我以为你比这更聪明。
Loretta, I thought you were smarter than that.

1107
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,388
费尔法克斯现在绝不会停止对我们的追捕。
Fairfax is never gonna stop hunting us now.

1108
01:03:41,523 --> 01:03:42,489
你在想什么？
What were you thinking?

1109
01:03:42,624 --> 01:03:44,559
我们有一座可以埋葬坟墓的火山
We have a volcano that could bury the tomb

1110
01:03:44,693 --> 01:03:48,228
在我们到达它之前，在我们看到它之前，在我们保存它的记忆之前。
before we get to it, before we see it, before we preserve its memory.

1111
01:03:48,362 --> 01:03:50,264
- 这是...
- 我很抱歉。这就是我们要做的事吗？
- This is...
- I'm sorry. Is that what we're doing?

1112
01:03:50,397 --> 01:03:52,900
因为没有人告诉我。你打算什么时候告诉我？
'Cause no one told me. When were you gonna tell me?

1113
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:54,401
我为什么要告诉你？
Why would I tell you?

1114
01:03:54,536 --> 01:03:56,270
我们是一起的。我来这里是为了救你。
We're in this together. I came here to rescue you.

1115
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:58,072
你知道你不是Dash，对吗？
You know you're not Dash, right?

1116
01:03:58,205 --> 01:04:00,407
你不能骑着白马去救人。
You don't ride in on a white horse to rescue people.

1117
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:04,912
你......给自己喷上古铜色剂，然后站在风力机前。
You... spray yourself with bronzer and you stand in front of wind machines,

1118
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:06,447
这对你来说是很好的。
which is great for you.

1119
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:09,216
你怎么会知道我到底是什么样的人？
How would you have any idea what I'm actually like?

1120
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:12,252
我了解你。你是一本相当开放的书，艾伦。
I know you. You're a pretty open book, Alan.

1121
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:14,188
- 好吧，那我是谁？
- 真的吗？
- Okay, then who am I?
- Really?

1122
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:15,356
是的。
Yeah.

1123
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,561
O...好的，呃...
O... Okay, uh...

1124
01:04:19,694 --> 01:04:22,764
你是返校节的国王，你靠着你的帅气来到洛杉矶。
You were a homecoming king and you coasted on your good looks to LA,

1125
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:25,399
但后来意识到，作为荒郊野外最英俊的孩子
but then realized that being the most handsome kid in the middle of nowhere

1126
01:04:25,533 --> 01:04:27,234
并不意味着你会成为一个明星。
doesn't mean you're going to be a star.

1127
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:29,136
直到有一天，当一个无法出版她的书的女人
Until one day, when a woman who couldn't publish her book

1128
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:32,873
关于西班牙在大西洋的殖民化问题的报告决定写一本浪漫小说。
on Spanish colonization in the Atlantic decided to write a romance novel,

1129
01:04:33,006 --> 01:04:34,875
呃，随机选择你作为封面人物。
uh, chose you at random to be on the cover.

1130
01:04:35,008 --> 01:04:38,445
你和她很幸运，这些小说取得了巨大的成功。
Lucky for you and her, the novels were a smashing success.

1131
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,549
她继续写她的废话，你继续摆姿势。
She kept writing her schlock, you kept posing,

1132
01:04:41,683 --> 01:04:47,121
嗯，你知道，我们都没有成为我们希望的人。
um, you know, neither one of us becoming who we'd hoped we would be.

1133
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:51,325
呃，然后有一天，我们都死在了丛林里
Uh, and then one day, we both die in the jungle

1134
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:55,295
在我多年前写的那些大西洋岛屿中的一个。
on one of those Atlantic islands I wrote about all those years ago.

1135
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:56,463
对吗？
Right?

1136
01:04:57,799 --> 01:04:59,133
嗯，嗯。
Mm-hmm.

1137
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:12,179
顺便说一句，那是萨拉索塔。
It was Sarasota, by the way.

1138
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,214
它不是无处可去。
It's not nowhere.

1139
01:05:14,348 --> 01:05:16,584
我在那里与我的母亲和两个姐妹一起长大。
I grew up there with my mom and two sisters.

1140
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:17,752
而且，是的...
And yeah...

1141
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,388
我开始做模特
因为我想离开。
I started modeling
'cause I wanted to get away.

1142
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:23,424
这是我唯一能想到的工作。
It was the only job that I could think of

1143
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:26,795
可以带我去所有我一直梦想去的地方。
that could take me to all of the places that I always dreamed of going.

1144
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,195
然后终于到了洛杉矶。
Then finally to Los Angeles,

1145
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:31,031
在那里我在你的浪漫小说的封面上摆了一个姿势。
where I posed on the cover of your romance novel.

1146
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:34,067
我非常尴尬，因为我的一个朋友可能已经看到了我。
And I was so embarrassed that one of my friends might've seen me

1147
01:05:34,201 --> 01:05:36,303
在你书的封面上戴着假发的人
in that wig on the cover of your book

1148
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:39,139
以至于我好几个月都避免与他们交谈。
that I avoided talking to them for months.

1149
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,609
然后有一天。
And then one day,

1150
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:44,144
我正走在回家的路上。
I'm walking home,

1151
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:47,047
我听到这位女士大叫。
"小飞！"
and I hear this lady yell,
"Dash!"

1152
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:49,651
她跑了过来，她是如此的高兴。
She runs up, and she is so happy.

1153
01:05:49,784 --> 01:05:53,521
然后我想。
"我怎么会这么难堪
Then I thought,
"How could I be this embarrassed

1154
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:56,323
关于让人如此高兴的事情？"
about something that makes people this happy?"

1155
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:01,295
洛雷塔，你可以做你想做的事。
Loretta, you can do whatever you want.

1156
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:03,497
如果你不想再写，就不要写。
If you don't want to write anymore, don't write.

1157
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:08,101
但是，不要把喜欢你的作品的人说成是白痴，从而减少他们的利益。
But don't minimize the people that love your work by calling it schlock.

1158
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:10,839
这对他们来说是不公平的。
That's not fair to them.

1159
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:14,909
你知道什么是讽刺吗？我以为你是最了解的人
You know what's ironic? I thought you of all people would know

1160
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:17,512
不以貌取人
not to judge a book by its cover.

1161
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:24,151
以封面模式判断一本书。
Judge a book by its cover model.

1162
01:06:55,617 --> 01:06:56,718
阿兰?
Alan?

1163
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:58,151
阿兰。
Alan.

1164
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,498
他们有两个人。
There's two of them.

1165
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:20,340
- 洛雷塔！我在这里！
- 艾伦!
- Loretta! I'm over here!
- Alan!

1166
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,411
艾伦！摩托车和枪，摩托车和枪！
Alan! Motorcycles and guns, motorcycles and guns!

1167
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:26,681
来吧，这边走！
Come on, this way!

1168
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:28,448
停止射击！
Stop shooting!

1169
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:35,590
- 把羊皮纸给他们吧！
- 我不能。
- Just give 'em the parchment!
- I can't.

1170
01:07:35,723 --> 01:07:38,358
是的，你可以，实际上。你只要说，"在这里，"然后把它扔给他们。
Yes, you can, actually. You just say, "Here," and throw it at 'em.

1171
01:07:38,492 --> 01:07:40,762
对。然后我相信他们会高兴地让我们走。
Right. And then I'm sure they'll happily let us go.

1172
01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:42,864
- 好了，继续往下看。
- 他们怎么会一直找到我们？
- Okay, keep down.
- How do they keep finding us?

1173
01:07:42,997 --> 01:07:45,465
- 你基本上是一个行走的迪斯科球。
- 我们需要想出一个计划。
- You're basically a walking disco ball.
- We need to come up with a plan.

1174
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,634
我有一个想法。
I have an idea.

1175
01:07:46,768 --> 01:07:48,235
我们要挖一个洞，扔掉我们的声音。
We're gonna dig a hole, throw our voices.

1176
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,270
"我们在这里。"你的声音能像鸟一样吗？
"We're over here." Can you sound like a bird?

1177
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,674
- 不，我有一个计划。
- 艾伦，拜托，我在想。
- No, I have a plan.
- Alan, please, I'm thinking.

1178
01:07:52,807 --> 01:07:56,376
- 我知道，但我有一个计划。
- 拜托，让我想想...
- I know, but I have a plan.
- Please, just let me think about...

1179
01:07:56,511 --> 01:08:00,147
- 等一下。他们在向你射击。
- 是的，这就是为什么我们要躲起来。
- Wait a minute. They're shooting at you.
- Yeah, that's why we're hiding.

1180
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,550
不，不，不，不。他们只向你开枪。
No. No, no, no. They're shooting only at you.

1181
01:08:02,684 --> 01:08:05,152
他们不会向我开枪。我的大脑才是有价值的。
They won't shoot me. It's my brain that's valuable.

1182
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:09,156
我认为你有时并没有真正听到你说的那些话。
What? I don't think you actually hear the things you say sometimes.

1183
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:11,926
- 也许我可以为你提供保护。
- 你不是在保护我。
- Maybe I can shield you.
- You are not shielding me.

1184
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,261
- 我应该保护你。
- 为什么？因为我是个女人？
- I should be shielding you.
- Why? Because I'm a woman?

1185
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:17,464
- 这是极度的性别歧视。
- 好吧，听着，我不认为利用妇女作为人肉盾牌
- That's supremely sexist.
- Well, look, I don't think using women as human shields

1186
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:20,334
正是格洛丽亚-宋飞心目中的改变，你呢？
is exactly the change that Gloria Seinfeld had in mind, do you?

1187
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:23,236
- 格洛丽亚-斯坦尼姆？
- 管他呢。她也是。你知道吗？好吧。
- Gloria Steinem?
- Whatever. Her too. You know what? Fine.

1188
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:26,440
- 请你现在就向我解释一下性别歧视。
- 哦，我的上帝。我是一个女人。
- Please mansplain sexism to me right now.
- Oh, my God. I am a woman.

1189
01:08:26,574 --> 01:08:28,643
我无法解释任何事情。
I can't mansplain anything.

1190
01:08:28,776 --> 01:08:33,447
呃，我是个女权主义者，我认为女人可以做任何男人能做的事。
Uh, I'm a feminist, and I think a woman can do anything a man can do.

1191
01:08:33,581 --> 01:08:36,017
- 我们只需要呆在这里，直到他们累了。
- 我有一个想法。
- We just need to stay here until they get tired.
- I have an idea.

1192
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:37,819
- 我可以告诉你我的计划吗？
- 艾伦!
- Please can I tell you my plan?
- Alan!

1193
01:08:37,952 --> 01:08:41,254
这不是一个你可以通过撕开你的衬衫来摆脱的情况。
This is not a situation you can get out of by ripping your shirt off.

1194
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:43,357
不是我的衬衫。
Not my shirt.

1195
01:09:14,756 --> 01:09:16,024
三！
Three!

1196
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:17,759
- 是的!
- 哦!
- Yes!
- Oh!

1197
01:09:21,863 --> 01:09:23,698
哦。
Oh.

1198
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:27,035
这与我头脑中的想法不同。
That was different than I had in my head.

1199
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:31,238
- 我只是希望我们能阻止他们。
- 会不会是风让它这么做的？
- I just wanted us to stop them.
- Could it have been the wind that made it do that?

1200
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:33,440
不，我认为是我们。我认为......我们做到了。
No, I think it was us. I think... we did it.

1201
01:09:33,574 --> 01:09:35,943
我们做过一个人，对吗？但那是，就像...
We did the one guy, right? But that was, like...

1202
01:09:36,077 --> 01:09:39,413
我们只是想让他停下来。但我认为另一个人本来可以移动，真的。
We just wanted him to stop. But I think the other guy could've moved, really.

1203
01:09:39,547 --> 01:09:41,649
所以，那是......那是在他身上。
So, that was... that one was on him.

1204
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:44,619
即使我们不在这里，这也可能发生。
Even if we weren't here, that could've happened.

1205
01:09:44,752 --> 01:09:46,453
你为什么要停在悬崖边上？
Why are you gonna stop next to a cliff?

1206
01:09:46,587 --> 01:09:48,990
他们戴着头盔，所以也许他们是...
They were wearing helmets, so maybe they're...

1207
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:51,291
但他们身体的其他部位没有头盔。
But the rest of their body didn't have a helmet.

1208
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:52,627
所以就只有一个头了。
So there'd just be a head.

1209
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,029
他们是在鲁莽驾驶，对吗？
They were driving recklessly, right?

1210
01:09:55,163 --> 01:09:56,898
在自行车上不要吝啬。
Don't be mean on a bike.

1211
01:09:57,565 --> 01:09:59,332
不要在自行车上做卑鄙的事情。
Don't do mean stuff on a bike.

1212
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:05,338
我的意思是，也许他们很好。
I mean, perhaps they're fine.

1213
01:10:05,472 --> 01:10:07,842
是的，可能没有。但这也没关系。
Yeah, probably not. But that's okay.

1214
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:12,279
这没关系。你知道，事情发生了。我们走吧。
That's all right. You know, things happen. Let's go.

1215
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:17,685
- 你要把它装回去吗？
- 它是借来的。
- You gonna put it back together?
- It's on loan.

1216
01:10:30,497 --> 01:10:32,834
- 看着我。
- 好的。
- Look at me.
- Okay.

1217
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:35,703
我还能做什么，你知道吗？
What more can I do, you know?

1218
01:10:35,837 --> 01:10:37,739
你已经做了这么多，贝丝。
You've done so much already, Beth.

1219
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:40,875
我可怜的、可爱的、小娜娜已经失去了视力。
My poor, sweet, little Nana has lost her sight.

1220
01:10:41,008 --> 01:10:43,711
这本书的发布是一场彻底的灾难。
The book release is a complete disaster,

1221
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:45,479
其中我已经利用了一切。
which I've leveraged everything on,

1222
01:10:45,613 --> 01:10:47,915
所以我现在可能，最肯定是破产了。
so I'm probably, most definitely broke right now.

1223
01:10:48,049 --> 01:10:51,284
而最重要的是，我失去了一位作家。
And most importantly, I've lost a writer.

1224
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:52,920
谁会这样做？谁失去了一个作家？
Who does that? Who loses a writer?

1225
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:57,491
好吧，贝丝，你让我想起了我最好的朋友，兰迪。
Okay, Beth, you remind me of my best friend, Randy.

1226
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,128
总是为他人着想。
Always looking out for other people,

1227
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,630
从不照顾自己。
never taking care of herself.

1228
01:11:03,598 --> 01:11:05,066
对不对，兰迪？
Isn't that right, Randy?

1229
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:09,369
她就像我的治疗师，这个人在这里。
She's like my therapist, this one over here.

1230
01:11:09,503 --> 01:11:11,572
LOL。"笑出声来"。
LOL. "Laughing Out Loud."

1231
01:11:11,706 --> 01:11:13,708
在你照顾好你的朋友之后。
After you take care of your friend,

1232
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:15,877
我们去海滩怎么样？
how about we go to a beach?

1233
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:18,478
- 什么？
- 听着，我在夏威夷有一个接应。
- What?
- Look, I have a pickup in Hawaii.

1234
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:20,548
她不一定要来。
She doesn't have to come.

1235
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:23,450
好的！好的，你可以来！
Okay! Okay, you can come!

1236
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:25,620
她很搞笑。
She's hilarious.

1237
01:11:26,386 --> 01:11:28,156
让我问你一件事。
Let me ask you something.

1238
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:30,423
我们都坐在这里闲聊，但谁在驾驶飞机？
We're all sitting here chitchatting, but who's flying the plane?

1239
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:32,492
- 自动驾驶。
- 什么？
- Autopilot.
- What?

1240
01:11:32,627 --> 01:11:35,328
先生，到驾驶舱去，驾驶飞机。
Sir, go to the cockpit, fly the plane.

1241
01:11:35,763 --> 01:11:36,798
好的。
Okay.

1242
01:11:37,532 --> 01:11:39,267
我要去降落飞机了。
I'm going to go land the plane.

1243
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,802
好的。
Okay.

1244
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:42,804
不，不，不。带上山羊。求你了，把山羊带走吧。
No, no, no. Take the goat. Please, take the goat.

1245
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:45,640
她在休息。享受飞行
She's on break. Enjoy the flight!

1246
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:22,342
- 你好。
- Hola.
- Hi.
- Hola.

1247
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:29,449
这个英国人走进来，基本上绑架了她。
This English dude came in and basically kidnapped her.

1248
01:12:31,586 --> 01:12:34,922
<嗨，我是贝丝。请留言，我马上给你答复。
Hey, it's Beth. Please leave a message, and I'll get right back to you.

1249
01:12:35,056 --> 01:12:37,925
呃，你好，贝丝。
Uh, hi, Beth.

1250
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:39,026
是我。
It's me.

1251
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,995
呃，我还活着！
Uh, I'm alive!

1252
01:12:41,696 --> 01:12:43,764
嗯，听着，嗯...
Uh, listen, um...

1253
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:46,100
呃...
Uh...

1254
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:51,606
我很抱歉，我搞砸了新书巡展。
I'm sorry that I blew up the book tour.

1255
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:53,440
嗯...
Um...

1256
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:55,910
我只是害怕
I was just afraid

1257
01:12:57,011 --> 01:12:58,646
和自私。呃...
and selfish. Uh...

1258
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:01,481
哦，艾伦来了。我再打给你。
Oh, here comes Alan. I'll call you back.

1259
01:13:04,685 --> 01:13:07,688
所以，呃，警方正在寻找费尔法克斯。
So, uh, police are searching for Fairfax,

1260
01:13:07,822 --> 01:13:10,258
而且他们会在我们在这里的时候为我们提供保护。
and they're gonna provide us protection while we're here.

1261
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,159
他们有没有说我们会在这里呆多久？
Did they say how long we'd be here?

1262
01:13:12,293 --> 01:13:14,929
他们将在今晚晚些时候尝试让我们乘坐水坑跳车。
They're gonna try to get us on a puddle jumper later this evening.

1263
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:17,231
但是，呃，他们说在这期间，旅馆真的很好。
But, uh, they said in the meantime, the inn is really nice,

1264
01:13:17,365 --> 01:13:19,967
我们可以洗漱一下，也许还能换件衣服。
and we can get cleaned up and maybe a change of clothes.

1265
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:21,501
好的。
Okay.

1266
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:26,507
好的，是的。
Okay. Yeah.

1267
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,761
谢谢你。
Thank you.

1268
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:24,532
来吧。
Come on.

1269
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:25,866
与你的丈夫跳舞。
Dance with your husband.

1270
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,768
- 不，不，不。
- 他不是我的丈夫。
- No, no, no.
- He's not my husband.

1271
01:14:27,902 --> 01:14:29,570
- 没关系的。
- 与他共舞。
- It's okay.
- Dance with him.

1272
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:32,173
不，不。她不想这样做。她没有合适的鞋子。
No, no. She doesn't want to. She doesn't have the right shoes.

1273
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:34,809
事实上，这是这双鞋唯一适合的地方。
Actually, it's the only thing these shoes are right for.

1274
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:37,178
你不需要这样做。
You don't have to do this.

1275
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:39,080
没事的。没事的。
It's okay. It's okay.

1276
01:14:39,947 --> 01:14:40,982
是吗？
Yeah?

1277
01:15:59,528 --> 01:16:01,195
我想知道她在说什么。
I wonder what she's saying.

1278
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:05,166
这是民间传说。
It's folklore.

1279
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,469
关于一个女人的情歌
Love song about a woman

1280
01:16:08,602 --> 01:16:11,972
她的爱人死了，而她不想离开他的身边。
whose lover died, and she didn't want to leave his side.

1281
01:16:12,873 --> 01:16:15,876
于是她躺下，拒绝起床。
So she laid down and refused to get up.

1282
01:16:16,444 --> 01:16:18,145
一定很吓人。
Must be scary.

1283
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:22,216
不得不面对你的未来，没有和你一起计划的人。
Having to face your future without the person that you planned it with.

1284
01:16:34,563 --> 01:16:36,130
那是什么？
What was that?

1285
01:16:38,232 --> 01:16:41,869
请原谅我。请原谅我。那个，嗯... 你唱的最后一句话。
Excuse me. Excuse me. The, um... the last line that you sang.

1286
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:44,338
<i>Quién llorará junto a mí?</i>。
¿Quién llorará junto a mí?

1287
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:50,077
"岛屿将在无尽的眼泪之井中为我哭泣。"
"The island will weep for me in the well of endless tears."

1288
01:16:50,211 --> 01:16:53,614
那是什么？"无尽的眼泪之井"？那是一个真实的地方，还是...
What is that, the well of endless tears? Is that a real place, or...

1289
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:55,282
天坑的地方。
Sinkhole place.

1290
01:16:57,084 --> 01:16:58,786
谢谢你。<i>谢谢你，谢谢你。</i>。
Thank you. Gracias, gracias.

1291
01:16:58,919 --> 01:17:01,021
- 来到这里，来到这里。
- 它是什么？
- Come here, come here.
- What is it?

1292
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:04,391
嘿，在羊皮纸上，它说。
Hey, on the parchment, it said,

1293
01:17:04,526 --> 01:17:08,597
"卡拉曼国王和他的财宝在无尽的眼泪之井中安息。"
"King Kalaman and his treasure laid to rest in the well of endless tears."

1294
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:10,865
我想也许这是个比喻。
I thought maybe it was a metaphor.

1295
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:12,867
不是的。
It's not.

1296
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,836
无尽之泪的井是一个地方。
The Well of Endless Tears is a place.

1297
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,938
这是个天坑。
It's a sinkhole.

1298
01:17:18,072 --> 01:17:20,307
地图上有一个天坑。
There's a sinkhole on the map.

1299
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:23,344
我认为坟墓就在那里。
I think the tomb is there.

1300
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:25,846
- 这比你的书好多了。
- 什么？
- This is so much better than your books.
- What?

1301
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,414
有像...不，我没有任何冒犯的意思。
There's like... No, I don't mean any offense.

1302
01:17:27,549 --> 01:17:29,416
- 我是在开玩笑。我是在开玩笑。
- 这就像，平等。
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- It's, like, equal.

1303
01:17:29,551 --> 01:17:31,752
- 我是在开玩笑。我是在开玩笑。
- 看看你。你想去那里。
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- Look at you. You want to go there.

1304
01:17:31,886 --> 01:17:33,687
- 什么？没有。
- 我可以看到。是的，你看到了。
- What? No.
- I can see. Yes, you do.

1305
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:36,891
那就太疯狂了。这将是疯狂的。我只是...我只是...我只是...
That would be insane. That would be insane. I just... I just...

1306
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:41,428
只是，我们离它如此之近，但是，你知道，我们不能...
It's just that we're so close to it, but, you know, we can't...

1307
01:17:41,563 --> 01:17:42,830
没有。
No.

1308
01:17:42,963 --> 01:17:45,666
这是你的故事。你想怎么写？
This is your story. How do you want to write it?

1309
01:17:46,433 --> 01:17:48,736
我想知道，它就在那里。
I'd like to know that it's there,

1310
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:50,504
这一切都意味着什么。
that all this meant something.

1311
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:52,439
好的。那我们走吧。
Okay. Then let's go.

1312
01:17:52,574 --> 01:17:54,441
我们会多呆一天。只要太阳一出来。
We'll stay one more day. As soon as the sun's up,

1313
01:17:54,576 --> 01:17:56,243
我们要去找无尽之泪的井。
we're gonna go find the Well of Endless Tears.

1314
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:59,246
- 但如果什么都不是呢？
- 那又怎样？然后我们说我们努力了。
- But what if it's nothing?
- So what? Then we say we tried.

1315
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,549
费尔法克斯呢？
And Fairfax?

1316
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:03,150
警察在追捕费尔法克斯。不要为他担心。
The cops are after Fairfax. Don't worry about him.

1317
01:18:04,218 --> 01:18:04,985
这很疯狂。
This is crazy.

1318
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:06,820
- 是的，但看看你。
- 什么？
- Yeah, but look at you.
- What?

1319
01:18:06,954 --> 01:18:09,924
这是我第一次看到你完全不畏惧。
It's the very first time I've ever seen you totally unafraid.

1320
01:18:10,525 --> 01:18:12,193
而且还活着。
And alive.

1321
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:14,828
我去告诉他们我们的计划有变，然后给我们找一辆车。
I'm gonna go tell them our plans have changed and find us a ride.

1322
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:16,430
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

1323
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:22,102
我看到你在这里遇到了我的朋友。
I see you met my friend here.

1324
01:18:22,236 --> 01:18:26,641
他告诉我你正准备跳上飞机。
He told me you were just about to jump on a plane,

1325
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:29,176
不说再见就走了。
without so much as saying goodbye.

1326
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:32,681
我说，"不可能。不是我的洛雷塔。
I said, "No way. Not my Loretta.

1327
01:18:32,813 --> 01:18:37,318
当她是唯一能带我到坟墓的人时，就不会。"
Not when she's the only one who can lead me to the tomb."

1328
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:42,790
不要再这么用力挤压了。
Stop squeezing so hard.

1329
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:46,427
嗷。把你的手从我身上拿开!
Ow. Get your hands off of me!

1330
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:49,163
嗷！放手吧！
Ow! Let go!

1331
01:18:49,631 --> 01:18:50,798
我需要一辆车。
I-I need a car.

1332
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:52,866
一辆汽车，一辆汽车。有人有汽车吗？
A car, an auto. Does anybody have an auto?

1333
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:02,409
不，不。不，不。
No, no. No.

1334
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,411
我-我-我需要一辆汽车。
I-I-I need an auto.

1335
01:19:04,546 --> 01:19:05,913
我可以用我的手表和你交换。
I'll trade you my watch.

1336
01:19:06,046 --> 01:19:07,348
这是一块非常昂贵的手表。你有车吗？
It's a really expensive watch. Do you have a car?

1337
01:19:07,481 --> 01:19:08,983
这是个宝格丽。这东西在黑暗中发亮。
It's a Bulgari. This thing glows in the dark.

1338
01:19:09,116 --> 01:19:10,918
- 它是防水的。
- 我有摩托车。
- It's waterproof.
- I have motorcycle.

1339
01:19:24,532 --> 01:19:26,233
很酷，不是吗？
Cool, isn't it?

1340
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:29,503
我总是想，为什么你的个人坦克不能也有一个迷你吧？
I always thought, why can't your personal tank also have a minibar?

1341
01:19:29,638 --> 01:19:31,071
喝一杯吧。
Have a drink.

1342
01:19:31,205 --> 01:19:32,741
你介意吗？
Do you mind?

1343
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:34,241
呃，是的。
Uh, yes.

1344
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,477
恐怕他对你有点怨恨。
He has a bit of a grudge against you, I'm afraid.

1345
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:39,380
关于他的朋友发生的一场摩托车事故？
Something about a motorbike accident his friends had?

1346
01:19:39,514 --> 01:19:40,682
你为什么要这样做？
Why are you doing this?

1347
01:19:40,814 --> 01:19:42,584
我想要别人没有的东西。
I want something nobody else has.

1348
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,319
当我的父亲赠与...
When my father gifted...

1349
01:19:48,355 --> 01:19:49,857
正如我所说的。
As I was saying,

1350
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,893
当我的父亲把他的帝国赠予
when my father gifted his empire

1351
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:55,496
给我的小弟弟...
to my baby brother...

1352
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,104
那是谁？
Who is that?

1353
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:15,015
那是一个骑着轻便摩托车的肯娃娃吗？
Is that a Ken doll on a moped?

1354
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:17,284
我在某个地方认识他。
I know him from somewhere.

1355
01:20:17,418 --> 01:20:19,053
哦，我-我-我怀疑。
Oh, I-I-I doubt that.

1356
01:20:19,186 --> 01:20:21,355
因为你正在看的是
Because what you are looking at

1357
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:24,358
是一名训练有素的战斗专家。
is a highly trained combat specialist,

1358
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:28,062
在阿富汗、伊拉克的熔炉中锻造。
forged in the furnaces of Afghanistan, Iraq,

1359
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:30,765
科威特, 萨...萨拉索塔...
Kuwait, Sa... Sarasota...

1360
01:20:30,898 --> 01:20:32,966
令人难以置信的皮肤。没有湿疹问题。
Incredible skin. No eczema problems.

1361
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:36,738
在我安全之前，他是不会停止的。
And he will not stop until I am safe!

1362
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:39,039
所以你把这个太空舱拉过来。
So you pull this space tank over,

1363
01:20:39,173 --> 01:20:42,309
除非你愿意像他的朋友那样灭亡。
unless you would like to perish like his friends did.

1364
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:45,846
他要对他们的灭亡负责。
And he is responsible for their perishment.

1365
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:48,616
他可能不是故意的。
He might not have meant to,

1366
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,052
但他们......灭亡了，所以......。
but they... perished, so...

1367
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:08,168
好吧，这是谁--谁？
Okay, who-who is this?

1368
01:21:08,302 --> 01:21:10,237
我以前在哪里见过他。
I have seen him somewhere before.

1369
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:13,907
不，不，不。
No, no, no.

1370
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:15,710
这是你的封面模特，对吗？
That's your cover model, isn't it?

1371
01:21:15,844 --> 01:21:18,178
是的，我知道我在哪里认识他。
Yes. I knew I knew him from somewhere.

1372
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,080
上去吧。
Get up there.

1373
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:21,549
并创造性地杀死他。
And kill him creatively.

1374
01:21:21,683 --> 01:21:23,785
我喜欢看男人们的失败。
I love watching hunks fail.

1375
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:28,422
我想我要喝那杯酒。
I guess I-I will have that drink.

1376
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,325
哦，该死。
Oh, shit.

1377
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:34,027
如果我只是把它顶掉，可以吗？
Is it okay if I just top 'er off?

1378
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:35,295
是的，这很好，但是...
Yeah, that's fine, but...

1379
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:37,364
哦，我的上帝，你以前用过玻璃吗？
Oh, my God, have you used a glass before?

1380
01:21:37,498 --> 01:21:38,833
对不起。
Sorry.

1381
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:40,467
Jack Trainer会怎么做？
What would Jack Trainer do?

1382
01:21:42,637 --> 01:21:43,671
这里很热。
It's hot in here.

1383
01:21:43,805 --> 01:21:46,808
有没有人觉得天气很热？
Anyone else feeling how hot it is?

1384
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:47,975
你是想表现得性感吗？
Are you trying to be sexy?

1385
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:49,878
这非常奇怪。请停下来。
This is very weird. Please, stop.

1386
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,912
我可以让你的世界着火。
I could set your world on fire.

1387
01:22:02,423 --> 01:22:04,726
睡觉去吧！睡觉去吧！
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

1388
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:06,628
睡觉吧!睡觉！
Go to sleep! Sleep!

1389
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:10,832
哇，哇，哇。
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1390
01:22:10,964 --> 01:22:12,199
暂停时间。
Time-out.

1391
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:13,300
时间到了!
Time-in!

1392
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:21,942
不！不要向她开枪！我需要她！
No! Don't shoot her! I need her!

1393
01:22:23,578 --> 01:22:25,412
哦，天哪!
Oh, Jesus!

1394
01:22:25,547 --> 01:22:26,980
嗷，嗷，嗷。
Ow, ow, ow.

1395
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:33,353
移动你的脚!移动你的脚！
Move your foot! Move your foot!

1396
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:38,560
去睡觉吧，混蛋。
Go to sleep, asshole.

1397
01:22:38,693 --> 01:22:40,427
到外面去!看!
Get out there! Look!

1398
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:46,266
一个更大的家伙？
A bigger guy?

1399
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,635
哦，不。
Oh, no.

1400
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,204
什么？
What?

1401
01:22:52,707 --> 01:22:53,575
快走吧!
Move it!

1402
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:57,612
不，不，不。不，不，不，不。
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1403
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:00,414
嘿，快进来。
Hey! Get in.

1404
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:02,015
是他还是我？
Him or me?

1405
01:23:06,086 --> 01:23:10,925
这不是你那些廉价的、虚无缥缈的女士幻想书，洛雷塔。
This is not one of your cheap, vapid lady-fantasy books, Loretta.

1406
01:23:11,058 --> 01:23:13,026
这就是现实生活。
This is real life.

1407
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:15,797
而且我们会杀了他。
And we will kill him.

1408
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,665
告诉我们坟墓在哪里。
Tell us where the tomb is.

1409
01:23:32,312 --> 01:23:33,581
嗨，那么，不管是谁在负责。
Hi. So, whoever's in charge,

1410
01:23:33,715 --> 01:23:36,316
我需要你派官员到这里来。
I need you to send officials to go here.

1411
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,585
在这里。
Here.

1412
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,487
我们已经关门了。
We are closed.

1413
01:23:40,622 --> 01:23:42,022
你关门了？
You're closed?

1414
01:23:43,925 --> 01:23:47,060
你知道我一年半来一直想打盹吗？
You know I've been trying to take a nap for a year and a half?

1415
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:48,730
一年半的时间。
A year and a half.

1416
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:52,734
我一直在两头烧蜡烛。
I have been burning the candle at both ends,

1417
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:54,167
凌晨的油。
the midnight oil,

1418
01:23:54,301 --> 01:23:57,170
在我的朋友被绑架之前，我就已经开始了。
since way before my friend got kidnapped.

1419
01:23:57,304 --> 01:23:59,172
而我想做的是
And all I want to do

1420
01:23:59,707 --> 01:24:01,843
是把我的脚踢回来
is kick my feet back

1421
01:24:01,976 --> 01:24:03,176
并喝一些酒
and drink some wine

1422
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,747
我可能太累了，不能喝酒。
that I'm probably too tired to drink.

1423
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,682
而且我想要按摩。
And I want a massage.

1424
01:24:07,815 --> 01:24:12,452
我希望有人为我按摩肩膀和脚。
I want someone to massage my shoulders and my feet,

1425
01:24:12,587 --> 01:24:14,589
而我同时也想要它。
and I want it at the same time.

1426
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:18,425
如果从逻辑上讲这没有意义，我也不在意。
And I don't care if logistically that doesn't make sense.

1427
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,228
因为我一直在努力工作。
Because I have worked hard.

1428
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:24,566
我知道你也有同样的方式。
The same way that I know that you have.

1429
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:27,602
所以我不想问你
So I hate to ask you

1430
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:30,103
让这个地方再开放几分钟。
to leave this place open a few more minutes,

1431
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:32,105
因为如果我们不这样做，
because if we don't,

1432
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,810
我的一个非常亲密的朋友和她的封面模特
a very close friend of mine and her cover model

1433
01:24:35,944 --> 01:24:37,712
将会死亡。
are going to die.

1434
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,036
没有好的办法，老板！
No good way in, boss!

1435
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:04,304
山洞呢？
What about the caves?

1436
01:25:05,073 --> 01:25:06,440
那太危险了!
That's too dangerous!

1437
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:09,544
好吧，那我们会非常小心。
Well, we'll be very careful then.

1438
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:24,458
嗯，来吧！
Well, come on!

1439
01:25:29,097 --> 01:25:30,898
- 这种方式。
- 我有一个规则，关于
- This way.
- I have a rule about

1440
01:25:31,032 --> 01:25:32,567
不进入超级令人毛骨悚然的山洞。
not going into super creepy caves.

1441
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:46,814
- 朱利安?
- 他的名字是朱利安？
- Julian?
- His name is Julian?

1442
01:25:46,948 --> 01:25:49,851
他似乎更像巴克或布鲁斯。
He seems more like a Buck or a Bruce.

1443
01:25:49,984 --> 01:25:51,485
引领方向。
Lead the way.

1444
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:57,491
去吧。不要害怕。
Go on. Don't be scared.

1445
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:28,990
注意你的脚步。
Watch your step there.

1446
01:26:29,123 --> 01:26:30,290
布鲁斯!
Bruce!

1447
01:26:30,424 --> 01:26:31,391
- 朱利安。哦，不!
- 朱利安!
- Julian. Oh, no!
- Julian!

1448
01:26:31,526 --> 01:26:33,127
哇哦。
Whoa.

1449
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,796
哇哦。
Whoa.

1450
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,931
嗯...
Well...

1451
01:26:37,732 --> 01:26:39,433
让我们不要让他的死亡白费。
Let's not have his death be in vain.

1452
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:42,302
- 向上，向上。
- 你的意思是继续前进？
- Onward and upward.
- What do you mean onward?

1453
01:26:42,436 --> 01:26:44,872
我们现在不打算去抓他，是吗？
We're not gonna go and get him now, are we?

1454
01:26:45,006 --> 01:26:46,406
哦，伙计。
Oh, man.

1455
01:26:58,753 --> 01:27:00,387
- 这没什么。
- 好的。
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

1456
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:03,191
是的。听着，我们还是回到船上去吧。
Yeah. Look, let's just go back to the boat.

1457
01:27:03,323 --> 01:27:05,159
这一切都结束了。没有其他人必须死。
This is over. Nobody else has to die.

1458
01:27:05,292 --> 01:27:07,461
不，不，不。哈-哈!这是一种微风。
No, no, no. Ha-ha! It's a breeze.

1459
01:27:07,595 --> 01:27:09,964
这里有一条隧道。这可能通向坟墓。
There's a tunnel. This could lead to the tomb.

1460
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:11,933
- 这不是人的尺寸。
- 啊，为自己说话。
- That's not person-sized.
- Ah, speak for yourself.

1461
01:27:12,066 --> 01:27:14,301
来吧。这几乎是一个儿童滑梯。
Come on. It's practically a kiddie slide.

1462
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:16,738
- 更像是一个岩石括约肌。
- 或者是巨魔的肛门。
- More like a rock sphincter.
- Or a troll anus.

1463
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:19,239
好吧，好吧，你是通过肛门...
All right, well, you are going through the anus...

1464
01:27:19,372 --> 01:27:20,641
洞......隧道！
the hole... the tunnel!

1465
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:22,744
- 为什么是她？
- 你是我们煤矿里的金丝雀。
- Why her?
- You are our canary in the coal mine.

1466
01:27:22,877 --> 01:27:24,311
不，那是不可能的。我不能。
No, that's impossible. I can't.

1467
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:25,847
如果你通过了，请让我们知道。
Please let us know if you get through.

1468
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,281
如果我们没有你的消息，法比奥就得死。
If we don't hear from you, Fabio's got to die.

1469
01:27:28,415 --> 01:27:30,618
等等，我是遇难的少女？
Wait, I'm the damsel in distress?

1470
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:32,553
没关系的。我很好。
It's okay. I'm fine.

1471
01:28:08,523 --> 01:28:10,958
我做不到。我很抱歉。我不能。
I can't. I'm so sorry. I can't.

1472
01:28:11,092 --> 01:28:12,827
- 嘿。
- 什么？
- Hey.
- What?

1473
01:28:13,528 --> 01:28:15,462
嘿，你闻到了吗？
Hey, you smell that?

1474
01:28:15,596 --> 01:28:18,498
你是说价值几个世纪的蝙蝠粪便？是的，我绝对闻到了。
You mean centuries worth of bat feces? Yes, I definitely smell that.

1475
01:28:18,633 --> 01:28:20,868
你得为我大口呼吸。
You gotta take a big breath for me.

1476
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:27,307
你去吧。
There you go.

1477
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,342
你可以做到的，洛雷塔。
You can do it, Loretta.

1478
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:45,026
我想我看到了一条出路。
I think I see a way out.

1479
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:50,832
哦，奶酪和米饭
Oh, cheese and rice!

1480
01:28:55,435 --> 01:28:56,771
我成功了!
I made it!

1481
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:58,338
我成功了!
I made it!

1482
01:28:58,471 --> 01:29:01,008
看到了吗？完全是安全的。
See? Totally safe.

1483
01:29:01,976 --> 01:29:03,077
继续。轮到你了。
Go on. Your turn.

1484
01:29:04,745 --> 01:29:07,682
我过来了！马上来，好吗？
I'm coming through! Be right there, okay?

1485
01:30:11,879 --> 01:30:14,048
他们为什么要在这里建这个？
Why would they build this here?

1486
01:30:15,116 --> 01:30:16,817
但是怎么可能有人会去崇拜
But how is anyone supposed to worship

1487
01:30:16,951 --> 01:30:18,619
或记住你，如果他们甚至不能看到它？
or remember you if they can't even see it?

1488
01:30:18,753 --> 01:30:20,588
他们不是。
They aren't.

1489
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:23,691
这并不是卡拉曼的权力纪念碑。
This isn't a monument to Kalaman's power.

1490
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:27,328
这是一个悲伤的女人的藏身之所。
It's a hiding place for a grieving woman.

1491
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:30,965
塔哈来到这里，与她死去的爱人在一起。
Taha came here to be with her fallen lover.

1492
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,035
她只是想一个人待着。
She just wanted to be alone.

1493
01:30:35,703 --> 01:30:37,238
塔哈不希望我们在这里。
Taha doesn't want us here.

1494
01:30:37,371 --> 01:30:38,673
天啊，闭嘴吧，拉菲。
God, shut up, Rafi.

1495
01:30:38,806 --> 01:30:40,675
这只是火山的问题。
It's just the volcano.

1496
01:30:42,343 --> 01:30:43,644
来吧。
Come on.

1497
01:30:48,783 --> 01:30:50,450
我们必须继续前进。
We have to keep going.

1498
01:30:58,559 --> 01:31:00,227
好了。我们走吧，肌肉男。
All right. Let's go, Muscles.

1499
01:31:00,928 --> 01:31:02,797
把它打开。
Open it up.

1500
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:05,333
- 不要打扰他们。
- 她将佩戴头饰。
- Don't disturb them.
- She will be wearing the headdress.

1501
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:08,102
来吧。我们大老远跑来不是为了表达我们的敬意。
Come on. We didn't come all this way just to pay our respects.

1502
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:09,904
我不能，嗯...
I can't, um...

1503
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,875
- 呃...
- 我很抱歉，<i>abuela.<i>。
- Uh...
- I'm sorry, abuela.

1504
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:37,365
那是什么？
What is that?

1505
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:42,003
那些是......贝壳吗？
Are those... seashells?

1506
01:31:42,737 --> 01:31:45,573
皇冠是用贝壳做的？
The crown is made of seashells?

1507
01:31:45,706 --> 01:31:47,274
宝藏在哪里？
Where's the treasure?

1508
01:31:48,242 --> 01:31:49,710
她正抱着他。
She's holding him.

1509
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:54,281
你是说那个死去的人？
You mean the dead guy?

1510
01:32:00,721 --> 01:32:01,956
看。
Look.

1511
01:32:03,924 --> 01:32:05,626
这是他们的求爱。
It's their courtship.

1512
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,663
卡拉曼正在岛上寻找什么。
Kalaman is searching the island for something.

1513
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:14,068
罕见的红贝壳。
Rare red seashells.

1514
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:19,173
为了证明他的爱，他在一年内每天给她一个贝壳。
To prove his love, he gave her one shell every day for a year

1515
01:32:19,306 --> 01:32:20,841
并把它们做成了一个皇冠。
and made them into a crown,

1516
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:23,711
鲜红的颜色像他们爱情的火焰。
bright red like the flame of their love,

1517
01:32:23,844 --> 01:32:27,214
直到有一天，她接受了他的求婚。
until the day came where she accepted his proposal.

1518
01:32:27,348 --> 01:32:29,083
这从来不是关于珠宝的问题。
It was never about jewels.

1519
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:32,987
卡拉曼和塔哈的财富并不是物质的。
Kalaman and Taha's riches weren't material.

1520
01:32:34,889 --> 01:32:36,791
那是他们的爱。
It was their love.

1521
01:32:36,924 --> 01:32:39,226
这就是它的意义。这就够了。
That's what it meant. That was enough.

1522
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,594
就这样了？
So that's it?

1523
01:32:41,495 --> 01:32:44,432
所有这些时间和金钱
All of that time and money

1524
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:48,803
花在什么地方，只是一个廉价的比喻？
spent on, what, just a cheap metaphor?

1525
01:32:48,936 --> 01:32:51,705
- 这是一个相当丰富的比喻。
- 哦，闭嘴！
- It's a pretty rich metaphor.
- Oh, shut up!

1526
01:32:51,839 --> 01:32:53,808
我们得走了。我们现在得走了。
We got to go. We got to go now.

1527
01:32:53,941 --> 01:32:57,044
- 来吧。我们走吧。
- 不，不，不。你要留在这里。
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, no, no. You are staying here.

1528
01:32:57,178 --> 01:32:59,213
你认为这一切是如此甜蜜和诗意。
You think it's all so sweet and poetic.

1529
01:32:59,346 --> 01:33:01,816
好吧，那么你可以留在这里，度过你最后的时光
Well, then you can stay here and spend your last moments

1530
01:33:01,949 --> 01:33:04,885
思考这个比喻的丰富性。
pondering the richness of that metaphor.

1531
01:33:05,554 --> 01:33:07,822
- 进入。
- 什么？来吧，伙计。
- Get in.
- What? Come on, man.

1532
01:33:07,955 --> 01:33:10,357
- 哦，上帝。快进去吧。进到坟墓里去。
- 好的，好的。
- Oh, God. Just get in. Get in the tomb.
- Okay, okay.

1533
01:33:10,491 --> 01:33:13,094
我想，被活埋总比被埋死好。
It's better to be buried alive than buried dead, I guess.

1534
01:33:13,227 --> 01:33:16,531
- 这真的不是。
- 你知道，这是一个耻辱，真的。
- It's really not.
- You know, it is a shame, really.

1535
01:33:16,664 --> 01:33:18,132
这是一个地狱般的故事。
This is a hell of a story.

1536
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:20,935
可惜你不在身边，无法讲述。来吧。
Pity you won't be around to tell it. Come on.

1537
01:33:21,068 --> 01:33:22,603
- 但他们会死。
- 你也会
- But they'll die.
- So will you

1538
01:33:22,736 --> 01:33:25,372
如果你不停止成为这样一个雪花！到这里来！
if you don't stop being such a snowflake! Get over here!

1539
01:33:34,915 --> 01:33:36,917
这很好。这不是一个活跃的恶梦
This is fine. This is not an active nightmare

1540
01:33:37,051 --> 01:33:38,719
我从14岁开始就有了。
I've had since I was 14 years old.

1541
01:33:40,488 --> 01:33:41,922
嗷!
Ow!

1542
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:45,793
你为什么要走得这么快？这不是一场比赛。
Why are you going so fast? It's not a race.

1543
01:33:50,798 --> 01:33:53,100
等等，不！你在做什么？回到这里来！
Wait, no! What are you doing? Come back here!

1544
01:33:53,234 --> 01:33:57,905
你可能已经买下了这个岛，但现在这个岛拥有你了！"。
You may have bought the island, but now the island owns you!

1545
01:33:58,706 --> 01:34:00,241
你不能把我丢在这里！
You can't just leave me here!

1546
01:34:02,243 --> 01:34:04,645
拉菲！回来吧！
Rafi! Come back!

1547
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:08,249
我需要一艘船!
I need a boat!

1548
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:19,793
嘿，嘿，停下来！停下来！
Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

1549
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:23,598
救命啊!救命啊!
Help! Help!

1550
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:25,833
一个当地人刚刚偷了我的船!
One of the locals just stole my boat!

1551
01:34:25,966 --> 01:34:27,668
你见过一个女人吗？
Have you seen a woman?

1552
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:30,905
她是一个身穿亮片连衣裙的黑发女子。
She's a brunette in a sequined jumpsuit.

1553
01:34:31,038 --> 01:34:35,075
不，她是不是遇到了什么麻烦？
No. Is she in some sort of trouble?

1554
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,455
这有点好笑。
It's kind of funny.

1555
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:51,660
我过去一直认为这...
I used to think this...

1556
01:34:51,792 --> 01:34:53,662
这种事情是如此浪漫。
this sort of thing was so romantic.

1557
01:34:53,794 --> 01:34:55,129
是吗？
Yeah?

1558
01:34:55,262 --> 01:34:58,533
被锁在一个即将被熔岩埋葬的棺材里。
Being locked in a coffin about to be buried by lava,

1559
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:01,268
还是......搂着死人？
or... cuddling dead people?

1560
01:35:02,036 --> 01:35:05,072
只是和失去的爱情躺在一起。
Just laying down with a lost love.

1561
01:35:05,206 --> 01:35:06,473
像塔哈那样。
Like Taha did.

1562
01:35:08,976 --> 01:35:10,211
- 上帝。
- 哦...
- God.
- Oh...

1563
01:35:10,778 --> 01:35:12,112
哦，上帝。
Oh, God.

1564
01:35:12,246 --> 01:35:14,415
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1565
01:35:14,549 --> 01:35:16,984
我很抱歉，我没能救你。
I'm sorry that I couldn't save you.

1566
01:35:17,117 --> 01:35:19,119
我很抱歉我不能成为小飞。
I'm sorry I couldn't be Dash.

1567
01:35:19,621 --> 01:35:20,955
你是对的。
You're right.

1568
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:23,525
你一点也不像小飞。
You're nothing like Dash.

1569
01:35:23,658 --> 01:35:26,661
你并没有骑着白马来救我。
You didn't ride in on a white horse to save me.

1570
01:35:26,794 --> 01:35:32,166
你骑着一辆......借来的摩托车，消声器坏了。
You rode in on a... borrowed scooter with a broken muffler.

1571
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:34,969
是的。
Yeah.

1572
01:35:35,102 --> 01:35:38,005
我永远不可能写出像你这样的大飞。
I never could've written a Dash like you.

1573
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:41,842
因为我从来不知道
'Cause I never knew

1574
01:35:42,544 --> 01:35:44,278
一个像艾伦一样的小飞。
a Dash like Alan.

1575
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:46,847
我是如此害怕再次被生活所伤害
I was so afraid of being hurt by life again

1576
01:35:46,981 --> 01:35:48,315
我只是停止了生活。
that I just stopped living.

1577
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:50,417
看不到眼前的美好事物。
Couldn't see the good things in front of me.

1578
01:35:50,552 --> 01:35:54,121
我只是很抱歉我没有早点看到你。
I'm just so sorry I didn't see you sooner.

1579
01:35:55,055 --> 01:35:56,658
我也有一个忏悔。
I have a confession too.

1580
01:35:56,790 --> 01:36:00,662
看，我真的很喜欢我们这个新故事的走向。
See, I was really liking where this new story of ours was headed.

1581
01:36:00,794 --> 01:36:04,064
我只是想看看结果会如何，我猜。
I just wanted to see how it was gonna turn out, I guess.

1582
01:36:05,332 --> 01:36:07,901
<i>《洛雷塔和艾伦的冒险》</i>。
The Adventures of Loretta and Alan.

1583
01:36:10,004 --> 01:36:11,905
不，它需要一个比这更好的标题。
No, it would need a better title than that.

1584
01:36:12,039 --> 01:36:14,041
是的，当然。肯定是的。
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

1585
01:36:15,142 --> 01:36:18,946
对不起。只是...塔哈的大腿骨在戳我。
Sorry. Just... Taha's femur is poking me.

1586
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:24,351
拉菲一定留下了这个。
Rafi must have left that.

1587
01:36:24,485 --> 01:36:27,021
你怎么会忘记你的撬棍呢？它可以帮助我们逃跑。
How do you forget your crowbar? It's gonna help us escape.

1588
01:36:27,154 --> 01:36:28,757
不，他是故意留下的。
No, he left it on purpose.

1589
01:36:28,889 --> 01:36:30,558
哦，酷。我一直喜欢他。
Oh, cool. I always liked him.

1590
01:36:30,692 --> 01:36:32,059
- 一...
- 好的。
- One...
- Okay.

1591
01:36:32,192 --> 01:36:33,961
- ...二，三！
- 好的。
- ...two, three!
- Okay.

1592
01:36:34,094 --> 01:36:38,098
我希望他一开始就不要把我们留在这里，但是......。
I would've preferred him to not leave us here in the first place, but...

1593
01:36:38,767 --> 01:36:39,567
好的。
Okay.

1594
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:02,823
<i>Dulcius ex asperis.</i>。
Dulcius ex asperis.

1595
01:37:07,227 --> 01:37:09,063
困难之后更加甜蜜。
Sweeter after difficulty.

1596
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:17,171
上去吧！往树上跑!
Go up! Run for the trees!

1597
01:37:18,339 --> 01:37:21,275
等等。不对。不要紧。树木着火了。
Wait. Nope. Never mind. Trees are on fire.

1598
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,410
好的。
Okay.

1599
01:37:24,978 --> 01:37:26,847
我们可以通过隧道回去。
We can go back through the tunnel.

1600
01:37:27,816 --> 01:37:29,116
没有。隧道是不可能的。
Nope. Tunnel's a no-go.

1601
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:36,156
嗯，好的。我对其他想法持开放态度。
Um, okay. I'm open to other ideas.

1602
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:39,794
这里有一股水流。我们可以沿着它进入海洋。
There's a current. We can follow it into the ocean.

1603
01:37:39,927 --> 01:37:41,596
我们怎么知道另一边有什么？
How do we know what's on the other side?

1604
01:37:42,062 --> 01:37:43,197
我们不知道。
We don't.

1605
01:37:44,998 --> 01:37:47,167
只有一个办法可以找到答案。
There's only one way to find out.

1606
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:50,371
- 值得出疹子。
- 是吗？
- Worth the rash.
- Yeah?

1607
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:12,326
阿兰?
Alan?

1608
01:38:20,769 --> 01:38:22,002
艾伦!
Alan!

1609

- I'm alive.
- Oh, my God. I thought I killed you.

1614

那是贝丝吗？
Is that Beth?

1615
01:39:16,858 --> 01:39:18,091
洛雷塔!
Loretta!

贝丝，你来了！
Beth, you're here!

1620
01:39:30,672 --> 01:39:31,840
你为什么在这里？
Why are you here?

1621
01:39:31,972 --> 01:39:34,809
我告诉过你，我支持你，女孩!
I told you I got your back, girl!

1622
01:39:35,309 --> 01:39:37,177
我很抱歉!
I'm so sorry!

1623

我毁了那件连衣裙！"。
I destroyed the jumpsuit!

1624
01:39:39,881 --> 01:39:40,849
什么？
What?

不要紧!以后再说。
Never mind! Later.

1626
01:39:43,585 --> 01:39:45,553
我在一个山洞里发现了一个英国人。
I found a British guy in a cave.

1627
01:39:45,687 --> 01:39:48,155
我以为他是个小男孩，但他有满脸的胡须。
I thought he was a little boy, but he has a full beard.

1628

Beth, that's Fairfax! He kidnapped us!

我支持你，女孩。

你在哪里跑？那是一条船。

游到岩石那边去!
Swim over to the rock!

1637

- I don't got you. No, I got you.

Remember, you are my platonic man friend.

1655
01:41:11,271 --> 01:41:14,274
柏拉图式？我喜欢这句话的意思。
Platonic? I like the sound of that.

1656
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:17,077
不知道它是什么意思，但我喜欢它的声音。
Not sure what it means, but I like the sound of it.

1657

给你，兰迪。

你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

1660
01:41:37,464 --> 01:41:40,267
- 结束图书之旅的好方法，对吗？
- 嗯，嗯。
- Nice way to end a book tour, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1661
01:41:40,835 --> 01:41:42,570
嗯...
Um...

1662
01:41:42,704 --> 01:41:47,008
你知道，其实我有一句话，我喜欢在这样的时刻使用。
You know, I have a phrase I like to use in moments like these, actually.

1663
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:48,375
嗯...
Um...

1664
01:41:49,877 --> 01:41:51,278
<i>Quid deinde？</i>
Quid deinde?

1665
01:41:52,412 --> 01:41:55,550
它是拉丁语。它的意思是，呃，"接下来是什么？"
It's Latin. It means, uh, "What's next?"

1666
01:41:57,417 --> 01:41:58,920
<i>Quid cogitas？</i>
Quid cogitas?

1667

01:42:01,154 --> 01:42:02,289
Buca di Beppo.
Buca di Beppo.

1669

- 不，是的。
- Yeah. I know zero other Latin.
- No. Yes.

1670
01:42:07,562 --> 01:42:10,464
我为现在这个时刻查了一下。
I looked it up for this moment right now.

1671
01:42:11,264 --> 01:42:13,367
那么，接下来是什么呢？
So, what does come next?

1672

- 你会怎么写呢？
- 我不知道。
- How would you write this?
- I don't know.

1673
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:18,640
- 你会怎么写呢？
- 我们真的要我写这个吗？
- How would you write it?
- Do we really want me to write this?

1674
01:42:18,773 --> 01:42:21,109
- 只是尝试。试一试吧。
- 好吧，我写吧。
- Just try. Take a stab at it.
- Okay. I'll write it.

1675
01:42:21,241 --> 01:42:22,543
好的。
Okay.

1676
01:42:22,677 --> 01:42:25,647
"我们当时...他们，呃......站在一个海滩上。"
"We were... They were, uh... standing on a beach."

1677

为观众搭建了舞台。他们知道我们在哪里。
Sets the stage for the audience. They know where we are.

1678
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:29,584
你已经在笑了。你为什么要笑我？
You're already laughing. Why are you laughing at me?

1679
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:31,485
- 我不是在笑。我是在笑。
- 你是。
- I'm not laughing. I'm smiling.
- You are.

1680
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:35,657
"在褐色的棕榈树上面有

头发像树皮一样的少女。
bark-like hair of the maiden.

1682
01:42:39,226 --> 01:42:41,029
有一个死水母..."
There is a dead jellyfish..."

1683
01:42:41,161 --> 01:42:43,631
你所做的只是描述你现在实际看到的东西。
All you're doing is describing what you're actually seeing right now.

1684
01:42:43,765 --> 01:42:46,601
"他很紧张，因为他真的喜欢她。"
"He's nervous because he really likes her."

1685
01:42:47,434 --> 01:42:49,469
写得不错。

- 谢谢。
- 不客气。

1687
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:52,106
我将继续下去。
I'll keep going.

1688
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,775
"他深深地看了她的眼睛。

1689
01:42:53,908 --> 01:42:57,310
唯一能与那片海洋的脉搏相比的是
The only thing that could compare to the pulse of that ocean

1690
01:42:58,046 --> 01:42:59,147
是在......的悸动。"
was the throbbing in the..."

1691
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:02,349
- 好吧，不，你不能悸动。
- 为什么不呢？
- Okay, no, you can't throb.
- Why not?

1692
01:43:02,482 --> 01:43:04,152
不能带着悸动出场。
Can't come out of the gate with a throb.

1693
01:43:04,284 --> 01:43:06,554
- 你一直在悸动。
- 我没有带着它出场。
- You throb all the time.
- I don't come out of the gate with it.

1694
01:43:06,688 --> 01:43:08,623
- 你必须赢得这种悸动。
- 谁让你成为悸动女王的？
- You have to earn the throb.
- Who made you the queen of throb?

1695
01:43:08,756 --> 01:43:12,359
这通常是第四章的事情。你想让它在第四章适当地提出来。
It's usually a chapter four thing. You want it brought up appropriately in four.

1696

我想你在所有的章节中都会悸动。
"脉动"。
I think you throb in all the chapters.
"Pulsating."

1697
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:16,664
它是悸动的前奏。
It's a precursor to throb.

1698
01:43:16,798 --> 01:43:18,833
- "起伏不定"。
- 你刚刚跳到了五个。
- "Undulating."
- You just jumped to five.

1699
01:43:18,966 --> 01:43:21,836

- 就像一个普通的吻？
- How 'bout they just kiss? Why not?
- Just like a regular kiss?

1700
01:43:21,969 --> 01:43:23,805
是的。就像一个章节的开头之吻。
Yeah. Like a beginning-of-the-chapter kiss.

我很善于开始...

情况如何？有笔记吗？

第一章的尝试非常好。
Very good first chapter attempt.

1704
01:45:00,268 --> 01:45:01,769
噗!
Psst!

01:45:02,402 --> 01:45:03,905
注意。
Psst.

1706
01:45:04,839 --> 01:45:05,873
注意。

母亲...
Mother...

1708
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,645
你已经死了。
You were dead.

1709
01:45:10,778 --> 01:45:13,648
你的脑浆从你的脸上流出来，打在我的喉咙后面。
Your brains came out of your face and hit the back of my throat.

1710
01:45:13,781 --> 01:45:16,284
- 他在我的嘴里。
- 不要说他在你的嘴里。
- He was in my mouth.
- Don't say he was in your mouth.

1711
01:45:16,416 --> 01:45:18,019
- 我可以品尝到你。
- 千万别这么说。
- I could taste you.
- Don't ever say that.

1712
01:45:18,152 --> 01:45:23,323
我们只用了10%的大脑，所以我刚刚换了另外10%。
We only use 10% of our brain, so I just switched to another 10%.

1713
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:26,260
那么，你还好吗？
So, you're okay?

1714
01:45:26,393 --> 01:45:28,095
百分之百。
One hundred percent.

1715
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:29,697
意思是10%。
Meaning 10%.

1716
01:45:29,831 --> 01:45:31,498
我们以为你已经死了。
We thought you were dead.

1717
01:45:31,632 --> 01:45:34,334
自然，我有一些愤怒的问题，我需要放下。
Naturally, I have some anger issues I need to let go of.

1718
01:45:34,467 --> 01:45:36,871
- 当然了。
- 还有怨恨。
- Of course.
- And resentment.

1719
01:45:38,739 --> 01:45:40,041
见到你真好，伙计。
So good to see you, man.

1720
01:45:40,174 --> 01:45:42,210
好了，让我们把话说得更少。
Okay, let's keep the chatter down.

1721
01:45:42,342 --> 01:45:46,781
我们正在闭上眼睛，重新与我们的呼吸联系起来。
We're closing our eyes and reconnecting to our breath.

1722
01:45:47,815 --> 01:45:48,950
很好。
Great.

1723
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:50,785
很好。
