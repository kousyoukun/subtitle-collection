1
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:35,439
The lost City 2022
Subtransl.ed balloumowgly

2
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:44,689
you are amazing

3
00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:47,141
I want you to guide my heart

4
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:50,730
I felt that too

5
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,101
Thank you for your courage, Dash.

6
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:56,003
And on your intelligence,
which is similar to the intelligence of mathematicians

7
00:00:56,003 --> 00:01:01,345
It's not
about my Ph.D. It's about my gender studies

8
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,552
And all about you,
Dr. Lovemore.

9
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:09,827
The truth is, I never expected
to find the lost city of D

10
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:15,030
If I were you, I would
choose my words carefully because they are the last

11
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,219
You brought me straight
to King Claman's tomb and his queen's legendary fire crown

12
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:28,172
Now I
will be very rich while you two will die

13
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:32,279
What is this... are these your snakes?

14
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,219
No, they were here from the start

15
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,856
There are hundreds of snakes in this
temple waiting for our presence

16
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:40,098
Who feeds them?  Do you feed them?

17
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:40,831
No, I don't even know what they eat

18
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,208
Why isn't this snake biting him?
Is he trained not to sting criminals?

19
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,220
...In fact

20
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,153
I mean, the number of snakes in the temple...
is exaggerated, I'll delete this part

21
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,002
I think my character in the novel is good

22
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:56,399
I will delete this part

23
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,786
You
started writing the story, Loretta, right?

24
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,945
I will delete this part

25
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:06,618
Hi, I'm Beth, I don't want to get into
a fight and I'm going to post your card

26
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,601
But I look
forward to seeing the final chapter of the novel

27
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:15,754
I don't want to put you under pressure, but you
know there's some kind of pressure that motivates you and doesn't paralyze you.

28
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:17,480
You have the power to

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,729
<i>dinner date</i>

30
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,502
Thank

31
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:26,939
Here I am again, everything is ready for the book tour but the
only thing missing is the book

32
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,944
I have a feeling you don't want to publish
the book, you don't want to leave the house

33
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:37,438
Look, I know the
last five years have been tough after Johnny died.

34
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:43,458
And that the easiest way is
not to get out of the bathtub drinking white wine with ice

35
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,809
But
girl, there is a big world waiting for you

36
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:51,528
And I can't cancel the book, so make sure you write it down,
okay? I love you, bye

37
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:14,549
We have to keep going,
let's see what's behind that door

38
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,133
What if there is nothing behind it?

39
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,690
There is only one way to find out

40
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:27,555
Lovemore realizes that the
treasure she wanted is lost forever and her adventures are over

41
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:32,298
Doesn't
sound right? - Yes, but it's over.

42
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:44,149
All right, John, here I am

43
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:47,167
"Pleasure comes after hardship"

44
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:53,072
<i>The Lost City of D</i>

45
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,783
Well honey, time for the review

46
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,479
Are you sure of that?
Because I feel a tingle in my pants

47
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,724
From the back
and from the front while I'm wearing this robe

48
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:02,057
I
feel like a snowboarder and weirdo

49
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:04,758
It's a beauty thunderbolt, I love you so much

50
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,029
I don't know how to go with this dress

51
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:06,772
don't touch it

52
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:09,289
I don't touch
it, but I want to control it - Stop, stop -

53
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:14,112
Set it now because you can't set it on
stage and you're great, you're great, okay

54
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:16,346
Is it necessary to wear a
bright leggings like this?

55
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:19,844
You only have to wear it for a couple of hours,
don't ruin it, do you hear me? it's rented

56
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,754
Everyone wears sequins these days

57
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:24,594
Why did that woman picture me?

58
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:28,248
This is Alice,
the new admin of our social media page

59
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:30,933
It will help us direct our message
to the younger generations

60
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,682
And by that I mean 30-year-old
women who want the look of their 20s

61
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:35,192
how are you guys?

62
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,577
I looked at your account this
morning and found a tweet for you

63
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:43,717
You say, "Where's
my woman? Meet me at Ballroom C at 5 p.m.

64
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:48,299
Hashtag (Shawn
Mendes) ""Hashtag (I can't wait to meet you all)

65
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:51,484
Well, we're having a good time, let's go

66
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:54,065
We wanted to remind you that you are still alive

67
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:55,593
People know I'm still alive

68
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:59,077
And to remind you that you
are the best-selling author

69
00:04:59,077 --> 00:04:59,969
Only in romance novels

70
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:02,828
Yes, which brings a lot of profit

71
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:05,706
Profits
are not what I want people to know about

72
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,059
So you need a new description for you

73
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:12,367
Do you want a new description for me?
Listen, the only thing missing in this town is the writer herself

74
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:18,176
It lacked love and passion and lost its luster,
and this ranks fake history at its worst

75
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:22,920
Your book tour can
change all that We remind readers why they love you

76
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,374
Oh really? How about improving
our appearance with a little bit of the outdoors, too?

77
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:29,061
History has seen a lot of openness

78
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:34,480
Full search,
exploration and questions from the conscience

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,492
Will Lovemore and Dash find
Queen Taha's Crown of Fire?

80
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,484
Join them in their search

81
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:43,541
Well, listen,
I want to talk to you about something

82
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,736
There are a lot of people

83
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,211
I know
how much you hate doing these things

84
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:50,042
So I invited
Alan to do the question segment with you

85
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,096
What?

86
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,463
And the rest of the book tour

87
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:56,815
I expressed my express wish
that Dash would not show up with me, Alan would insult me

88
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,714
He won't insult
you. - Well, well done, thank you very much.

89
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,303
let me help you

90
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:06,676
It's like a body lotion,
it sparkles and spreads all over

91
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,961
There isn't a
single occasion he didn't take off his shirt

92
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,128
what a wish

93
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:13,533
He's
here, so act mature, let's go

94
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:18,067
Remember, try to be smiling
and your words are effective, away from any boredom

95
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:22,128
Yes,
let's go, let's start the event on TV

96
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:26,354
Yes, Lovemore lovers.

97
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:33,459
I am very excited to introduce you to a
world class writer. Welcome Loretta Sedge.

98
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,164
I can't - Are you kidding?
-

99
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:39,272
Listen, I'm on your
back, you can, go out and give people what they want

100
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:47,996
Nice to see you all, thank you

101
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,222
Yes like this

102
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:30,150
did you sit down  did you sit down  good

103
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,064
Are you ready?

104
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:41,570
And now the moment you have been waiting for, the most exciting and
influential heroine of our generation

105
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,883
You're Exaggerating - Cover
#20 from Angela Lovemore

106
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,697
(Dash McMahan)

107
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,821
Salute
the audience. - Already salute him.

108
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:43,946
Did you practice this?
My God, how I love the harmony between you two

109
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:47,139
And I have to say, I love your book

110
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,347
Thank

111
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:54,890
I'm going to burn some of the events of the novel, how did you two come to the
idea of ​​not entering the cemetery in the end?

112
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,113
This book is very
important to me personally

113
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:07,190
I don't know how to express my gratitude
that the extraordinary writer (Loretta) named the book after me

114
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,931
His name is
"The Lost City of Dash" or "The Lost City of D."

115
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,335
But the
word "D" is not an abbreviation of your name

116
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,101
Is it an abbreviation of the word
"bastard"? - No, not that either.

117
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:18,578
The name is based on the name of an ancient
tribe, which is (Dabka Disvim Mecha).

118
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:26,149
The name was too difficult for the
European colonists, so they shortened it

119
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,380
What an interesting piece of information

120
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,512
Well, we'll
answer some of the audience's questions

121
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:41,119
Actually, I'm the one who
wants to know what Loretta's most romantic moment is.

122
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,545
the wether is hot

123
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,358
My sexual desire for intelligence

124
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,377
...is this having to do with the sex around

125
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:58,549
No, I mean the feeling of sexual
gratification from intellect or intelligence

126
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,860
Me too -
Really? -

127
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,921
Take off your shirt, Dash.

128
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,990
No, no, I
won't do that today We're here for the book

129
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,605
Do you have any questions for Loretta?

130
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:15,064
Yes, the lady with
glasses who seems to like to read, what is your question?

131
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,988
Can you take off Dash's shirt?

132
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:21,677
No,
no, we won't do that today, I'm sorry.

133
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:26,747
Take off the shirt, take off the shirt

134
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:31,299
Of course, of course, yes, I will do that

135
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,704
really?

136
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:36,074
You don't have to?
- Yeah, people asked me for that.

137
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:43,093
Yes, yes, I will give the
people what they want Ladies and gentlemen Enjoy your time

138
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:47,921
The Lost
City of D is Dash's latest adventure.

139
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:56,522
If there's another book,
Lovemore will start getting the news of Dash's death.

140
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,882
Sorry, I stuck my watch in your
hair. - It's okay, it's okay.

141
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:03,039
Don't worry, take it off.
- Don't do that.

142
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,714
No, you're going to take my wig off

143
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,540
Oh my God, so sorry, so sorry

144
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,255
I am very sorry

145
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:17,050
What a spoiler of fun!

146
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,974
Don't
miss the fashion competition at 6 pm

147
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:29,508
Did you really say "if there would be another
book"? I invest everything I own in this round

148
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:32,899
I think my romantic
adventures with Dash are over

149
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,101
How will Dash die? A bite
from a snake? - no -

150
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:41,750
Well, one thing I have to take care of now is
that you two have an interview in 10 minutes

151
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,489
So, can you two act mature and go
there on your own? good? Thanks a lot

152
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,389
Will he die of staph infection?

153
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,553
So with staph
infection I knew it

154
00:11:55,683 --> 00:12:02,019
Look, I get it, we can take a break from
each other, but you can't plan for my death

155
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,376
I don't like getting
into this, but did you know you're not the real Dash?

156
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,555
It's just a character I made up

157
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:10,469
(dash)

158
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:20,240
From here, Loretta.
- I want to go from here.

159
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,950
Don't you think Dash is so important
to people? - but for you -

160
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,570
No, not for me, well yes, but for
people too, what do you think of that?

161
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,228
Beth can find you other
writers with great ideas

162
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:39,218
Then you can go on with your
showmanship in your favorite T-shirt and I'll be free myself

163
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,077
And everyone will be happy, no from here

164
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:47,076
Beth says you should leave
the house because that's what will make you really happy

165
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:50,228
You have to go out into
the world and see a lot of adventures and experiences

166
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,545
I've seen enough I'm
already satisfied

167
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:57,650
Why lock yourself up at home when you can wrap the world around?
You can visit ancient Greece

168
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:06,033
I get why, because you're
afraid of planes - No, because ancient Greece is in the past.

169
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,130
Exactly like Dash.

170
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,288
Well, do you really know
who lives in the past? You

171
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:16,911
You're afraid that your feelings will be hurt again
so you stop living, you're like a human mummy

172
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,167
I do not know

173
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,301
Mummies are really human

174
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,306
<i>Someraton Hotel</i>

175
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:35,815
Die

176
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:41,764
I'm so sorry, sorry, I'm going to clean up
this mess, I'm not a liberal, I assure you

177
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:47,005
Do you know... Do you know if I could
order a car? thank you thank you

178
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,897
bring the car

179
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,268
Oh my God, does that make sense?

180
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,668
I
always ruined everything with my words

181
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:59,592
She makes me nervous because every
time I talk, she is beyond me

182
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:02,590
I didn't say anything right, do you know
she wants to end my character in the novel?

183
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,971
I just want these tomatoes please

184
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:09,860
You're right, no, you're
right I should apologize to her, thank you very much

185
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,899
Sorry

186
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:24,007
I'm Loretta Sedge, yes

187
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,169
Good day

188
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:38,400
I didn't order a group ride from Uber - Someone
wants to meet you, we'll take you back.

189
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:43,723
(Loretta)

190
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:45,400
(Loretta)

191
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:49,675
(Loretta)

192
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:52,194
Did you say
"Loretta"? - yes -

193
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:53,573
Follow this car. - No.

194
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,152
Please -
No, no -

195
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:59,019
I will never help other handsome
models, it won't happen again

196
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:04,581
What is happening? Was she kidnapped?
...Am I being sold? Is it done

197
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,240
Am I being sold to him?

198
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,359
No, no, stop. - Isn't
that weird? -

199
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:20,033
I'm so sorry for the place,
I just arrived and I had a hard time finding the right shape

200
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,951
I love cheese so much
I bought all kinds

201
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,856
Are you the one who sent me the
email asking for pictures of my feet?

202
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:33,650
No, I promise what
I'm going to show you now will make you very happy

203
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,766
But I will tell you more
about the mysterious room that you see in front of you now

204
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:42,134
My name is Abigail
Fairfax. - Abigail? -

205
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:44,164
Yeah,
it's a unisex name like Leslie and Beverly.

206
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:48,449
Yes, but are you
Abigail Fairfax, the owner of the famous media company?

207
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:52,114
Wasn't the ownership of your company bought?

208
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:56,078
Actually, that was my brother
(Leslie) we feel so proud of it

209
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,198
Yes, indeed,
you are still very young to have such wealth

210
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:13,395
My true passion, you know, is the
things that are hidden in the world, all that is hard to come by

211
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:22,795
Some say I like putting together things but
there's one thing I'm really obsessed with

212
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:27,196
It's the famous crown
of fire and red diamonds

213
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,786
Is this...
is this some kind of prank software?

214
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:38,096
So imagine my surprise when I
stumbled across your book... in the midst of all these sexual feelings

215
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:41,591
On something really cool

216
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:45,259
I understand, I understand now

217
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,729
Oh my
God, I really thought you two kidnapped me

218
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:52,070
I mean, this is
the kind of marketing that Beth planned, right?

219
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,590
This is really cool guys, this is amazing

220
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:00,758
You, with that gun and mustache,
and your majestic figure

221
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,300
Oh my God, oh
my God, with your GI-Joe look and your clothes

222
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,264
The archaeologist
in the novel was translating an extinct language

223
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,711
Something no one could do

224
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:20,187
In fact, no one has ever
tried to write something like this before, have they?

225
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:23,820
Except for you, right?
- Except for me -

226
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,370
Yes, it turns out that a young college girl
Loretta Sedge is writing her dissertation

227
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,318
About the language
of the extinct (Di) tribe with her future husband

228
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,543
And she dreams of
finding the tomb of (Calaman) and the crown of fire

229
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:41,462
I'm so sorry to know that
you stopped looking...when he died, but what I mean is

230
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:43,482
You have already started your journey

231
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:47,110
Where is my trip?

232
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:52,572
Here we are now

233
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,788
What is that?

234
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:12,340
I think it accurately describes the location of
Claman's tomb.

235
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,239
Where the invaluable crown
of the Queen (Taha) is buried

236
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:21,377
Even if these
are actually events you have to find out

237
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:26,387
The location of
a whole hidden city that no one has found before

238
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:31,539
Already found
it on an unknown island in the Atlantic Ocean

239
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:35,075
But what
I couldn't really find was Claman's tomb.

240
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:39,198
And this manuscript is the only
thing that can lead us to it

241
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:43,189
I need someone who can
decipher these codes

242
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:51,015
Of course,
you don't want the story to end like this

243
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:56,106
We've all lost our
dreams or, in my case, pandered to my little brother

244
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:58,513
But this is our chance to prove it to them

245
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:06,043
Come with me to the island and
help me translate these symbols and help me find the Crown of Fire

246
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:08,767
You can order any amount you want

247
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:14,883
I have to politely decline

248
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:27,972
Well, I can't say you
didn't disappoint me, but I understand how you feel

249
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:32,561
Will you allow us to deliver you?

250
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:36,678
No
thanks, I will order my own car and I will

251
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:01,891
I don't think you're
listening... to me, this is an emergency and we are

252
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:06,282
Police say they
have announced her disappearance in a flyer

253
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:10,126
He kidnapped her by car and 24
hours passed and they did nothing

254
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,396
What about the FBI and the CIA?

255
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:13,867
I'm sure Loretta is fine

256
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:18,428
In my college days, my
girlfriend (Nikki) disappeared and everyone freaked out

257
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:20,706
But she was only in her car

258
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:24,288
It is true that she
was dead but we found her, she did not disappear

259
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:31,759
What if... we might have called
a private investigator... or private security agencies or

260
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,482
We want a rescue - Yes, who does things like
this? -

261
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,832
Veterans, right?
- yes -

262
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:39,147
I think I know someone
who can help us

263
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:43,050
I did a meditation session before

264
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,115
And there
was a coach, you really should see this guy

265
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:49,520
He was a
former trainer in the Special Operations Force

266
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,813
What was his name?  Yes, Jack Trainer.

267
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:53,969
So is his name the same as his job?

268
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,612
This is how I write names on my phone

269
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,792
You see, Janice the mother,
Larry the doorknob, Stacey the butt

270
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,499
But
that's what this guy does, he finds

271
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:03,698
Missing people,
if we want help, he is the right person

272
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,686
I'm Jack
Turner - His name is actually Jack Turner.

273
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:17,473
Hi,
I'm Alan from Touch Your Inner Self.

274
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,920
Meditation session

275
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,515
<i>(Jack Trainer)</i>

276
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:26,104
Anyway, listen, our friend Loretta
has been kidnapped and we need help

277
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:27,757
How long has she been missing?

278
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,171
Maybe 2 hours ago now

279
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:34,732
who
is she? - This is Beth. I'm Beth.

280
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,690
Is her phone connected to wifi?

281
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,699
She has her phone, right?
- No, I have her phone.

282
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:45,865
She has an electronic watch, it
was the reason my wig fell out

283
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:50,329
What happened then? It's
okay, open her phone and go to the electronic clock app

284
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,684
Then
press the button: Find my electronic watch

285
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:55,518
...Oh my God, that's cool, and that's why we say

286
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:58,136
"Encounter difficulties by finding easy solutions"

287
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:00,068
Who said it?  Oprah or Deepak Chopra?

288
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,166
Laozi said it in his book Daodijing.

289
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,017
Oh my God, it's in the Atlantic Ocean

290
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:08,008
Is she on a plane?
- How did you know that? -

291
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:10,169
Because she can't
swim that fast

292
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:11,917
The target of the hijacker does not appear to be a ransom

293
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:18,603
My guess is it's a bloody
hunting mission, a coke-powered mission, a total mess

294
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:19,841
We have to move fast

295
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,751
How will we pay you?
- Cryptocurrency via the application (cash) -

296
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,959
If you find
it 48 hours before, you will get a free rescue

297
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:29,109
More than you can imagine

298
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,376
I'll need her phone.
- I'll get it for you.

299
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:34,303
Send me the location
where the plane landed and I'll meet you there

300
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:49,814
Welcome

301
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,377
where am I?

302
00:22:55,377 --> 00:22:59,316
You're on my plane,
nice plane, aren't you?

303
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,416
I'm getting off your plane, untie me

304
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,588
It's the seat belt

305
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:12,263
Do you drug me?
Do people do such things?

306
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:17,001
So we consider it a classic method

307
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:20,532
I feel numbness all over my body
- It's going to wear off now.

308
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:25,874
Sorry about that but I can't
wait for you to change your mind, time is not on our side

309
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:31,289
As you can see, the
volcano that we are drilling into may erupt at any moment

310
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:35,094
And if that happens,
he will destroy everything in the Lost City

311
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,959
oh my god my legs hurt

312
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:42,379
So this is our
last chance to find the tomb and the crown

313
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,099
My God

314
00:23:44,697 --> 00:23:53,644
Don't worry, this isn't our last landing, it's the
beginning, the greatest adventure of your life

315
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:04,140
Welcome to the lost city

316
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:12,090
Subtransl.ed balloumowgly

317
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,569
How did you find it?

318
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,319
When the volcano became active
and filled with lava, some things appeared on the surface

319
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,362
D city showed itself

320
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:27,885
The whole city?
- No, no, just its surface.

321
00:25:27,885 --> 00:25:30,958
As soon as I heard the rumors,
I took my plane and bought the whole place

322
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,508
Site?
- No, the whole island -

323
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:36,673
I bought the
southern part at an affordable price, where it flows

324
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:42,664
Someone
here doesn't like romance writers

325
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:44,849
Yes, as the proverbs say

326
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:48,024
But Ravi doesn't like what's
going on, does he, Ravi?

327
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:54,796
He says we don't respect his heritage, but there
aren't many workers on the island, right, Ravi?

328
00:25:54,796 --> 00:25:57,213
'Beggars have no freedom of choice'

329
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:12,479
Yes, anything you want, just order

330
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:19,323
Untie
one hand, it has to translate some things

331
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:21,595
so what?

332
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:26,236
I really want you to try to realize
the great opportunity that lies ahead

333
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:30,538
I think this text will lead us to
the exact location of the cemetery

334
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:33,068
It's an alphabet based on symbols

335
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:36,227
Like
cuneiform or hieroglyphic writing

336
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,212
So if you have
other documents...I can compare them to them

337
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:46,599
Yes, we found a lot of scratches
next to the waterfalls and they were nothing but pictures of women

338
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:54,478
Look, I'm like you, I wish your husband...the archaeologist
was still alive to help us, but he's dead, so...

339
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:58,038
Time to shine, Loretta,
you sexy writer

340
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:01,068
They will come looking for me

341
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:02,944
Who exactly?

342
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,869
Do you mean your many cats?

343
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:07,295
I don't have cats

344
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:09,250
I'm sorry to hear that

345
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,242
I have a hamster, provocateur.
- You have a hamster anus? -

346
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:18,120
No, there is...there
is a comma between the two words, let alone that

347
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,617
I'm sure your
brother didn't kidnap anyone like you did

348
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:13,718
happy to see you

349
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:16,292
Give me the phone. Right.

350
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:28,436
What?

351
00:28:28,436 --> 00:28:33,300
I was thinking if I
could come with you

352
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,897
Why?
- for help -

353
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,957
I have CPR,
CrossFit and Karate skills

354
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:41,117
Well, well, listen, listen

355
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:46,038
It's my
fault, I don't mean kidnapping...etc, but I

356
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:50,319
I said bad things to
her and I want to see her to take back what I said

357
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,976
I told her it was a human mummy

358
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:55,010
Mummies are really human

359
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,498
I...
I knew it, yeah, that's right

360
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,554
Please

361
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:06,751
Well, I'm not responsible for
what happens to you, Alan.

362
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:07,853
well, okay

363
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:10,606
And you won't get out of the car?
- Yes.

364
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:13,165
In the car
- In the car -

365
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:15,450
All the time -
All the time? -

366
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,633
All the time

367
00:29:19,877 --> 00:29:20,627
yes

368
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,178
that's cool

369
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:32,894
Oh really? Does the Special
Operations Force use cars like these?

370
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:35,927
Only a fool would choose a
horse based on its color

371
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:38,878
Right, is that a quote
from Daodijing's book?

372
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:42,736
No, it was
written on the sign there at the rental location

373
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:52,089
Thank

374
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:26,271
What?  What?

375
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:33,309
I was hoping to invite you to breakfast
but it looks like you have work to do

376
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,389
wait wait

377
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:41,686
I think the manuscript
refers to some burial

378
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:49,108
So the translation is "(Kalaman)
and his treasure" then the missing pieces and then the word: burial

379
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:52,331
And there's something about "tears" too

380
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,747
Where is that burial?

381
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:00,523
...nothing was mentioned about it, me

382
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:03,742
Miss
Sedge, I want to do better than that

383
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:07,831
So next
time don't kidnap a romance novel writer

384
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:14,231
It can't be this difficult, we are going
to build a building with an important purpose and impact for a great man

385
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:18,621
King Claman was ambitious and
powerful, he was the first to build a city in the Atlantic Ocean

386
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:21,437
He was always under the watchful eye of his subjects

387
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:26,804
He would have built a pyramid, a ziggurat,
or a tower to put the crown of fire in it

388
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:29,422
All I want is to know where it is

389
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:36,046
I don't know if you remember or
not but you asked me to translate it and I already translated it

390
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:38,603
translate it again

391
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:46,491
We'll laugh about this one day

392
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:48,684
Something is destined to happen

393
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:56,882
I have to
come with you to help you because I'm cool

394
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:02,054
But it's really great
atmosphere Nature and wireless

395
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:08,112
Yes, you are right, but it is very important
for me that she knows that I came to save her

396
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:10,271
Why?  Do you like that woman?

397
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:17,223
No, no, she just brought some snacks
and she gets pissed off when she's hungry and her blood pressure drops

398
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:19,014
And I
understand it easily because I eat 5 meals a day

399
00:32:19,014 --> 00:32:21,434
Do you follow the keto diet?
Looks like you're following him

400
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,471
Yes, I mean you don't need it

401
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:27,151
What is the matter?

402
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:31,238
I don't want you to think
of me as a model in a novel

403
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:35,744
But you're much
more important than that, Alan, you're on guard

404
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:43,241
Well, I at least want to be the
one to get her into the car and say: Calm down, you're safe now

405
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,409
Of
course, hero, she'll love it so much

406
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:50,603
So will you start... will
the mission start now? good

407
00:33:25,064 --> 00:33:27,225
he slept

408
00:33:55,762 --> 00:33:56,894
(now what? -

409
00:33:56,894 --> 00:33:58,668
It's dishonesty, Alan.

410
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:01,285
I can help, let me help you

411
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:06,723
Stay
around but don't get yourself killed

412
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:13,098
Welcome

413
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,383
he slept

414
00:34:21,337 --> 00:34:25,007
I grabbed his head, what do you want me to do with it
now? I'll put it down

415
00:34:31,758 --> 00:34:32,258
no

416
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,156
No no

417
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:45,332
Wonderful

418
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:47,766
Teamwork, awesome

419
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:51,192
Your effort is
great, Alan, but this guy was already unconscious

420
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:53,671
I was just getting ready

421
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,168
...don't do that, when I'm

422
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:01,351
Welcome

423
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:07,840
Look behind you

424
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:20,728
He regained consciousness, Trainer.

425
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:22,678
stay on the ground

426
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:27,088
You are gorgeous

427
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:27,983
Thank

428
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:29,843
where are you going?

429
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,746
What?

430
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:39,568
Are you Loretta Sedge?

431
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:40,318
yes

432
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:42,998
I'll get you out of here

433
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,761
Why are you so handsome?

434
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:47,243
My father was a meteorologist

435
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:52,135
what are you doing here?

436
00:35:52,135 --> 00:35:55,348
Hey, no matter what,
I came to save you

437
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:02,137
Do you need a rescue in that area?
I think she's fine

438
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:05,684
Leave them, don't take their things
because they will chase after us

439
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:09,823
Why do you keep doing that, Alan?

440
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:11,505
You're
the one who keeps doing it, I just hit one

441
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,698
Seems wicked, it wasn't necessary

442
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:16,500
Sorry, I just wanted to win once

443
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,875
Excuse
me, can you untie me from the chair?

444
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:22,300
We don't have time - No time for that?
But you two have been gossiping now.

445
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,128
We have to go now

446
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:53,229
Why do explosions happen?

447
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,657
I'll take care of it

448
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:09,294
You're safe now?
- You're a mother.

449
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,482
How are you so calm?

450
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:13,647
This was... This was my sentence

451
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,354
there he is

452
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,189
What?

453
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:20,135
What is that? Is it a Reiki cure?
Are you treating me?

454
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:21,686
I think so

455
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:26,082
(Laoze) said: When the mind calms down
- the whole universe surrenders to it -

456
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:29,730
You know, I
know some good proverbs for this situation

457
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,502
"Ready for everything"

458
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:34,524
"Ready for anything"

459
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:40,547
Maybe you should stop looking each
other's eyes and act like I'm not here

460
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:45,187
who are
you? - Just a guy trying to do his job -

461
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:48,798
And now
my job is to get out...this beautiful lady

462
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,023
My God

463
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,102
What is happening?

464
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:02,046
I do not know what to do

465
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,742
I can't see, oh my god

466
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,361
there he is

467
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:09,697
Why are you throwing the gun at me?
- Oh really? -

468
00:38:10,494 --> 00:38:13,598
Get
out of the chair. - No time for that.

469
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:19,454
Bring your legs together like a kegel exercise.

470
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:21,330
Do you know what a kegel exercise is?

471
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,789
What are you doing?  stop it

472
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:32,667
Oh my God,
get in the car, start the engine, come on

473
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,116
Put your leg in.
Which one? -

474
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:36,568
Both, come on

475
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:46,037
Move forward,
forward. - Well, well, I don't know what to do.

476
00:38:47,012 --> 00:38:50,250
You are safe now

477
00:38:55,895 --> 00:38:59,034
Oh my God, is this my blood?
- I don't think it's your blood.

478
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:01,286
a lot of blood

479
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,991
My God

480
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,675
Is this his brain?
- what? -

481
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:07,801
I think the remains of his brain are on my face

482
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:11,514
I'm sure his
brain is in my mouth, I can taste his thoughts

483
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:12,899
Focus on the road

484
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,620
He liked to train people

485
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,069
What are you talking
about? - He loved me -

486
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:24,466
I'll try to untie myself, I'll untie myself

487
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:26,355
watch out

488
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:37,084
...did you see

489
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:40,285
no

490
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:48,781
oh my gosh, no, no

491
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:02,271
no

492
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:06,089
(right Now)

493
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:09,872
Are you well?  Did anything bad happen to you?

494
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:11,579
Can you free me from the chair?

495
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,419
yes, ok

496
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:16,734
Don't worry,
we have the car. - Uncuff me, please.

497
00:40:16,734 --> 00:40:18,360
ok i caught you

498
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,415
Get out of the chair,
get out of the chair - Yes, you're right, you're right -

499
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:27,345
Is this a nail file?
Just untie the rope - It works.

500
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:31,356
Maybe next time you can hold
the gun when I throw it at you

501
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:36,460
And you, when you throw a gun, you have to tell me
first, "Hold, Alan," and then you throw it at me.

502
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,704
The phrase "here is" is synonymous with the word: hold

503
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,424
No, it is not synonymous with it

504
00:40:40,424 --> 00:40:46,862
Yes, synonymous with it in the
vernacular we say "Here is the jacket", we say "Here is the pen."

505
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:50,431
No,
the correct way is to say: Hold the thing

506
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:54,917
Then I'll grab whatever
you're throwing because you started the sentence with: Hold

507
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:59,115
This is another way when
you have a gun, that's all

508
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:02,185
Watch out...we have to ask.

509
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,568
We should call for help
and go to the airport and get out of here, and I'll drive

510
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:07,996
good

511
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:24,393
Well, ask... ask for help

512
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,986
where is your phone?

513
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:30,391
My God

514
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:37,344
They told me you caught her
- We killed the blond.

515
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:44,466
What do you think, Loretta?

516
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:47,215
You may have killed
one of them but her partner is still with her

517
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:51,661
He is clearly
skilled and trained at the highest level

518
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:54,425
and very dangerous

519
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:12,448
So Miss Sedge said she was leaving the party
and then got in a car and left the party

520
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:15,120
Have you tried to contact her?
- She doesn't have her phone.

521
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,708
So her
phone was stolen? - I didn't say that.

522
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,865
Where is my magnifying glass?

523
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:23,195
Listen, can you help my grandmother?
I don't want you to know what happened to Loretta, it will make her sad

524
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:26,000
What happened to Loretta?
- Nothing, Grandma. I went on a trip.

525
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,122
Awesome?
- Yes.

526
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:30,415
She had to get out of the house

527
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:34,669
Here's what happened,
Loretta's phone wasn't stolen, I took it

528
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:39,231
I gave it to
Alan and he gave it to Trainer, Jack Trainer.

529
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,323
So we found her watch

530
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:43,517
And who is Alan?
- (Dash) -

531
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:46,591
And who is it?
He's the hero of all her novels.

532
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:49,507
O provocative grandmother

533
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:52,473
Let's go to the next
room and talk about the wars you've been through

534
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:55,589
Come on, it's going to be fun,
sorry, it's going to be fun

535
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:58,947
Listen, Loretta Sedge is missing,
and when I look up the location of a watch

536
00:42:58,947 --> 00:43:01,727
Her hand turns out
to be taking a plane to an island I've never heard of

537
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,865
This means that you
have to do something about it, and if you don't

538
00:43:03,865 --> 00:43:06,359
Do something,
I'll do it, and your attitude won't be nice

539
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,814
I'm sure it's
out of our jurisdiction, you should use the FBI

540
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:12,021
good

541
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:16,192
And if you talk to the detective, say a
good word about me - and about me as well.

542
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:18,315
about us

543
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:33,448
What are you
doing? Are you trying to reinstall the car?

544
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:36,087
...in fact, we can

545
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:56,587
I said where is the phone?
- In the cabin, in the cabin -

546
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:00,204
My God

547
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,381
We don't have a phone, and the car doesn't work

548
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:04,498
Hold on - what
is this? -

549
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:06,065
jungle shoes

550
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:08,873
Not a shoe for walking in the woods

551
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:12,359
It occurred to me that your feet would
hurt because of your shoes, I couldn't

552
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,184
Something better than
that, Allison shoes, sorry

553
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:18,666
Well,
thanks. - And I brought the cheese.

554
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:21,668
Oh,
my God. - You should drink water.

555
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:25,980
I could only find plastic
bottles so we have to get rid of them when we're done

556
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:31,709
So
what we have to do now is find a phone

557
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:36,151
We call the authorities
and then wait here for someone to come to our rescue

558
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,025
We are already in the rescue
operation, no one will come but me

559
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:41,936
What? - I'm the savior -

560
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:47,311
I would have come alone
first and then (Trainer)... have mercy on his soul

561
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:49,981
So our
best option now is to get to the airport

562
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:51,649
Do you see this way?

563
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,530
We will take a shortcut
from this area to the bush and then to the forest

564
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,518
Short cut to the
bush? - yes -

565
00:44:56,518 --> 00:44:58,201
Well, do you see us?
- yes -

566
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:00,669
You're not Dash and I'm not Lovemore, okay?

567
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:03,911
We're Loretta and Alan,
and the bush devours people like us

568
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:07,829
I don't want to
spoil my robe, it's a rental, so we'll stay here

569
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:09,879
We're not going to stay here without doing anything, okay?

570
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:15,504
So we'll go from the bush to
the airport and find a phone so you can eat the cake you want

571
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:19,008
And eat it too?
- If that's what you want, no problem, let's go.

572
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,203
It's the only thing that
can be done with a cake

573
00:45:21,203 --> 00:45:23,778
I don't know what your people do with
it, but my people eat it

574
00:45:23,778 --> 00:45:26,193
You can send it as a gift to someone

575
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:29,823
Even if,
eventually, they'll eat cake, everyone eats cake

576
00:45:29,823 --> 00:45:33,215
What would a small person do if he fell
into it? He won't be able to eat it

577
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:33,935
My God

578
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:04,779
Why were you kidnapped? Is this some
kind of weird sex like '96th Hour'?

579
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:09,068
Oh, my God, thanks, I thought so too, but it
turns out my kidnapper was a Fairfax family.

580
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:11,105
Is it Beverly?
- No, big brother -

581
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:15,184
That moron
has a vlog for Montezuma's treasure hunt.

582
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:17,406
I saw it on
the news, he was looking for the Titanic.

583
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:19,169
Yes, he is looking for the Crown of Fire

584
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:25,109
What? Hey, you mean the
real fire crown... like the one in the remains of a city

585
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:26,490
Yes, the lost city of D

586
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,754
What?  Are you kidding?

587
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:31,459
This is exactly like your
novel so we are on an adventure

588
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:34,171
Realistic from
the adventures of Lovemore and Dash, right?

589
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:36,090
...how - what
is this? -

590
00:46:38,306 --> 00:46:40,486
won't find it

591
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:43,550
Where will we go now?

592
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:50,553
We have to go into the water

593
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:52,771
What?
- We have to swim in the water -

594
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,250
No, I don't like water

595
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,783
We have to go
into the water I'm not asking you to live in it

596
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:59,487
My body doesn't get along with water

597
00:46:59,487 --> 00:47:01,676
Does it agree with killing you?

598
00:47:02,578 --> 00:47:04,738
You're okay, I caught you, I caught you

599
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:09,485
where
are you going? - I'll cross the river -

600
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:12,489
Don't stay in
the water, I researched security strategies

601
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:15,517
From the book "A Year in
the Woods" They won't be able to track us in the water

602
00:47:15,517 --> 00:47:18,407
Why is the water warm?  Are you urinating?

603
00:47:18,407 --> 00:47:20,952
Just swim away from the urine

604
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,927
I guess...
I think we ran from them, didn't we?

605
00:47:52,927 --> 00:47:56,118
Yeah, it wasn't bad, yeah

606
00:47:56,662 --> 00:47:58,193
...good

607
00:47:58,193 --> 00:47:59,495
Don't panic

608
00:47:59,495 --> 00:48:01,284
What do you mean not to
panic? - Don't panic -

609
00:48:01,284 --> 00:48:03,540
No, stop saying that

610
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,864
There is something on your back

611
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:09,695
No, what is this?
- Stop screaming -

612
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:11,530
What is that?  Do you have one?

613
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,401
No, I don't - Why
don't you have one? -

614
00:48:13,401 --> 00:48:16,009
Maybe
it's my non-stick cap, I don't know

615
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:17,622
Take
them off!

616
00:48:17,622 --> 00:48:21,299
I can't touch blood-sucking
insects, try to take them off

617
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,501
Quickly
- You pick them up and take them off.

618
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,657
You pick them
up and take them off - Try to catch them.

619
00:48:25,657 --> 00:48:27,981
Try to... I don't like it

620
00:48:27,981 --> 00:48:31,075
I feel like I'm
going to lose consciousness they suck my soul

621
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,042
stop, stop

622
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,676
stop that sound

623
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:43,164
How many are they?
- Not a large number -

624
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:46,321
I feel
like they suck on me they suck on my body

625
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:47,989
oh my god oh my god

626
00:48:47,989 --> 00:48:52,255
Why do you say oh my god? Is it that bad?
It can't be that bad, how many are there?

627
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:53,751
It's not great

628
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:56,035
They will suck every part of my body, help me

629
00:48:56,035 --> 00:48:59,818
Please
stop talking, I need to take another look

630
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:06,420
My God, they will
suck up my body and only dry skin will be left of me

631
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,005
You can't
tell my dad I died this way, tell him I was

632
00:49:09,005 --> 00:49:12,213
I wrestle with an anaconda, or while
I carry a sword or something similar

633
00:49:12,213 --> 00:49:15,003
I feel like a jumba and
they suck every drop of me

634
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:16,808
Why are they on my ass?

635
00:49:16,808 --> 00:49:20,942
It's like taking
anchovies out of my Caesar salad, it's not too bad

636
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:26,036
Why are you talking about food now?
Let's just find the queen and get out of here

637
00:49:26,036 --> 00:49:28,986
I think you're
fine now I want to check you from the front

638
00:49:28,986 --> 00:49:31,315
Well, I don't want to look

639
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:34,626
Is it bad?

640
00:49:35,253 --> 00:49:37,347
Oh my gosh - what's up?
just talk -

641
00:49:37,347 --> 00:49:45,815
I mean, when one has high expectations
and gets excited about someone

642
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:49,030
Everyone is excited -
why are you excited? -

643
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,218
What I mean is that
people ask, they don't know, they don't know, right?

644
00:49:53,218 --> 00:50:00,017
They do not know until the moment
comes when they know, and they know something they did not know before

645
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:01,934
Are there parasites or not?

646
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:05,941
Don't worry, your brave warrior is alone now

647
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:09,545
Warriors of... What?
- are you okay -

648
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:14,650
It takes guts,
why do they like butts like this?

649
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,321
What are you singing?

650
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:11,920
It's a song I used to
hear when I was little

651
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:18,819
It says if you try to
take life from the island, the island will take your life

652
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:22,708
Did your
grandmother sing songs about the taking of life?

653
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:25,445
I can't even translate the song very well

654
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:28,810
What
diseases may be transmitted by parasites?

655
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,987
They don't eat eggs, do they?

656
00:52:19,675 --> 00:52:21,862
The Queen (Taha)

657
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:39,649
"King (Kalaman) he and his treasure are buried."

658
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:43,789
Buried in a well of endless tears

659
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:46,544
What does
"buried in the well of endless tears" mean?

660
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:48,265
(Loretta)

661
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,489
You're going to give me a heart attack

662
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:52,356
where did you go?

663
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:58,329
What is that?

664
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:01,730
I'm not sure, maybe they meet here

665
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:09,708
Can you imagine they were here?
Exactly on our site

666
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:14,763
The stories they were telling, I'm sure
a lot of historical events happened here

667
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,793
Looks like
they're getting close to us. - We have to go up.

668
00:53:22,793 --> 00:53:25,812
Do you see what I'm wearing?  Tight clothes with sequins

669
00:53:25,812 --> 00:53:28,995
Don't worry, we'll go up, come on, let's go

670
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:33,739
I can't
do that. I'm old. - No, you're beautiful.

671
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:37,578
I didn't say I wasn't
pretty, I said I was too old to do things like this

672
00:53:37,578 --> 00:53:41,073
All I do is sit and eat
when I can't think

673
00:53:41,073 --> 00:53:43,804
Yes, you need better
shoes than this

674
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:50,442
You're the one who
brought me these shoes, I can't go up with them

675
00:53:50,442 --> 00:53:56,084
I know you feel safe
hanging on to the past, but you can move forward, okay?

676
00:53:56,084 --> 00:53:57,506
I can't, I can't

677
00:53:57,506 --> 00:53:59,491
Do you smell this
scent? - what? -

678
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:00,623
There is smoke

679
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:05,207
What is the matter? Do they burn anything?
Are they hunting of some kind? what do you think?

680
00:54:07,762 --> 00:54:10,088
Take a deep breath

681
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:12,617
Yes like this

682
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:14,836
Well done

683
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:18,058
That
was convenient, thank you - Yes, it was -

684
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:21,101
...I'll help you a little, one, two

685
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:24,306
What are you doing?  stop it

686
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:26,548
Don't
move. - This is my sensitive area.

687
00:54:26,548 --> 00:54:29,355
Just go upstairs, head up!

688
00:54:29,355 --> 00:54:32,432
You're
doing well, keep going, keep going up

689
00:54:32,432 --> 00:54:34,245
Come on

690
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:56,364
"Pleasure comes after hardship"

691
00:54:56,364 --> 00:54:57,965
What?

692
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:03,882
Nothing, it's like Johnny and I used
to say after we'd done something like.

693
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:11,504
The process of excavation or translation of a
manuscript, it is a Latin proverb that means: Pleasure comes after difficulties

694
00:55:11,504 --> 00:55:16,164
How do you say "(Loretta) strong" in Latin?

695
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:19,698
Yes I am strong, I climbed a mountain

696
00:55:19,698 --> 00:55:22,755
My
God, how I wish Beth saw us doing this

697
00:55:22,755 --> 00:55:26,019
Oh,
my God, Beth - Don't worry about that.

698
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:29,487
I'm sure she sent the entire Special
Operations team to look for us

699
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:33,151
I understand you want to go to
the island authorities yourself

700
00:55:33,151 --> 00:55:36,265
But don't worry,
I used her account on social media for that

701
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:42,188
She tweeted: I just
got hijacked Hashtag (FML) Hashtag (Shawn Mendes)

702
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:47,010
Are you traveling alone?
- Yes, I will travel alone.

703
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,362
Let's hope that works

704
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:50,022
Well, talk to me

705
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:53,959
You're going to New York,
then you'll take a plane to Guinea, then a high-altitude plane

706
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:55,636
plane what?

707
00:55:56,132 --> 00:55:57,647
Small plane?
- Yes, with cramped seats.

708
00:55:57,647 --> 00:56:01,250
It's
okay, I'll take it - Then you go home.

709
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:13,421
We want something
flammable, everything is wet now, what's in your bag?

710
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:15,472
a lot

711
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,876
what are you doing?

712
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:18,345
face masks

713
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:19,908
Yes, it is a gift basket

714
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:22,048
Did
you bring scented candles to the bush?

715
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:25,191
My mom gave me that wax it was a
weird gift from her on Mother's Day

716
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:28,006
Is your mother the one who
brings you gifts on Mother's Day?

717
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:31,869
Noir perfume
with the scent of eucalyptus and rosemary

718
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:33,572
What a good smell

719
00:56:33,572 --> 00:56:36,338
well, okay

720
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:37,591
yes

721
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:40,234
Yes, I managed to start a fire

722
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,852
This is really amazing

723
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:45,900
Who would have imagined that?

724
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,453
Do you take off your shirt?

725
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:53,480
Sounds like a bad feeling, are
you okay? I mean your back

726
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,270
Yeah,
that's why I don't like water. - I see.

727
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:00,378
My body becomes full of pills like a child

728
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:02,873
Do you put something on it?
An ointment, for example, or something similar?

729
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:07,302
Yes,
I do, but it was in the little bottle

730
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:08,657
Was this?

731
00:57:08,657 --> 00:57:11,346
Sorry, my God, I'm sorry

732
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:12,986
decent

733
00:57:12,986 --> 00:57:19,094
Wait, yeah, come
here, come, sit down

734
00:57:19,094 --> 00:57:21,000
here?
- yes -

735
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:23,318
good

736
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:25,260
You don't have to touch it, it's okay

737
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:30,819
I touched
your engorged vesicles, so... the parasites

738
00:57:30,819 --> 00:57:31,889
good

739
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:34,565
It will be a little cold on your skin

740
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,799
Sorry, sorry

741
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:43,781
This is probably a very interesting
way for Dash to die in the novel

742
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:45,865
I can work on an ending like that

743
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:47,743
Oh really?

744
00:57:47,743 --> 00:57:50,166
I like it

745
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,980
How will you write it?

746
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,980
good

747
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,396
"I feel the warmth of the fragrant fire"

748
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:03,500
strong start

749
00:58:03,737 --> 00:58:07,469
"...the hands (Loughmore) have explored the"

750
00:58:14,702 --> 00:58:24,015
And the familiar land
met each edge, new and exciting, round and crimson

751
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:26,834
...is this

752
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,406
Didn't make him alienate him?

753
00:58:28,406 --> 00:58:28,906
no

754
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:37,935
Because with every crimson edge, Lovemore discovers another
letter of the language that only their bodies speak.

755
00:58:38,858 --> 00:58:41,266
And what were their bodies saying?

756
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:44,550
"Take me"

757
00:58:46,452 --> 00:58:48,363
"Take me"

758
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:50,019
"Take me"

759
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:51,588
How do you feel?

760
00:58:51,588 --> 00:58:53,560
A wonderful feeling

761
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,033
Let's get back on your back.
- All right.

762
00:58:57,281 --> 00:59:00,443
Yes, I also talk about my back

763
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,690
our supplies

764
00:59:12,637 --> 00:59:17,531
Well, I'm cold I think I'll...
sleep a little

765
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:19,309
ok thanks -
are you ok? -

766
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,668
Yes, I'm on fire, I mean I'm fine

767
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:25,018
I didn't mean "on
fire", I meant I'm fine next to a blazing fire

768
00:59:25,018 --> 00:59:26,018
good

769
00:59:35,686 --> 00:59:42,357
It's up to you, but if you get cold we can
sleep here next to each other, if you want to

770
00:59:43,064 --> 00:59:44,636
Clan... both of us?

771
00:59:44,636 --> 00:59:48,620
It's okay
if you don't want to. - Yeah, it's all.

772
00:59:49,608 --> 00:59:51,074
...OK how

773
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:52,621
Go up first and I'll follow you

774
00:59:52,621 --> 00:59:56,479
No,
you go up first as you know women first

775
00:59:56,479 --> 00:59:58,477
Keep your hands out all the time

776
00:59:58,477 --> 01:00:01,123
That's
what I want to do, I'll keep it outside

777
01:00:01,123 --> 01:00:02,227
Yes, that's it

778
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,448
what
should I do? - Just let's sit together -

779
01:00:04,448 --> 01:00:07,429
Do we sit
together? - yes -

780
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:11,330
Looks like we're going to flip
this thing over like a sinking ship

781
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:14,208
Well, what... wait, I didn't come in

782
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,190
Why does this thing get into my ribs?

783
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:21,219
What would happen if... I couldn't breathe

784
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:23,763
Well, is everything all right?
- I can not breathe -

785
01:00:24,271 --> 01:00:26,251
yes, ok

786
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,801
My hands
are out, our backs facing each other

787
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:32,181
good

788
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:05,101
cool, come on

789
01:01:05,101 --> 01:01:10,575
Come on, I
want to hear the clap, let's clap for Loretta.

790
01:01:10,575 --> 01:01:14,524
You
deserve it, old writer made you call

791
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:17,765
About
yourselves in the bush, well done, Loretta.

792
01:01:17,765 --> 01:01:21,117
Boss, people are dying now

793
01:01:21,117 --> 01:01:24,466
Don't you think we're
exaggerating what we're doing?

794
01:01:25,229 --> 01:01:27,177
Is it worth it?

795
01:01:27,177 --> 01:01:30,585
I'm
about to get something out of reach

796
01:01:30,585 --> 01:01:37,304
A rare thing, something that no nation or
emperor could reach, not even flattering my brother would lead me to it

797
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:40,671
Legendary Fire Crown

798
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:44,988
So
yeah, I'll say it's definitely worth it

799
01:01:54,092 --> 01:01:56,424
Excuse me

800
01:01:56,424 --> 01:01:58,826
Excuse me, sir, my flight will resume

801
01:01:58,826 --> 01:02:03,023
There is no flight,
the pilot is sick, come tomorrow

802
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:08,523
No, no, sir, I can't
come tomorrow. I want the trip today to Handeda Island.

803
01:02:08,523 --> 01:02:12,058
Tonight, some
people's lives are in danger. - Come tomorrow.

804
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:17,254
Excuse
me, miss. - Yes.

805
01:02:17,254 --> 01:02:21,283
I couldn't help myself from
snooping over you and overheard you talking about steak

806
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:26,598
Well, what I'm
going to say is crazy but I love steaks too

807
01:02:26,598 --> 01:02:28,122
What?

808
01:02:28,122 --> 01:02:33,134
I also like steaks...you might like...
I don't know, maybe

809
01:02:33,134 --> 01:02:38,641
No, it's a similar word, I meant
their lives are in danger, I have to get to the island tonight

810
01:02:40,551 --> 01:02:45,985
Well, I
think I can help you, I have a cargo plane

811
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,207
Maybe I can drop
you off to the island after the goods are delivered

812
01:02:50,927 --> 01:02:53,420
I'm going to ask
you something but you have to answer me honestly

813
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,961
Have you ever killed someone before?

814
01:02:55,961 --> 01:02:56,461
no

815
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,620
no

816
01:03:02,368 --> 01:03:09,521
I don't believe you, but I will tell you something, if you think
for a moment about killing me, I promise I will kill you first.

817
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:13,667
It would
be my pleasure - You weirdo, let's go -

818
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:14,170
The treasure of King
(Kalaman) is buried in the well of endless tears

819
01:04:15,746 --> 01:04:17,883
What is that?

820
01:04:17,883 --> 01:04:21,317
...it's...it's...it's something

821
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:23,964
It's not what you think

822
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:27,918
Isn't this a piece of the
old Fairfax manuscript?

823
01:04:27,918 --> 01:04:31,216
Well, maybe it's what you think

824
01:04:31,216 --> 01:04:35,857
I thought you were smarter
than that, Loretta, Fairfax will never stop chasing us

825
01:04:35,857 --> 01:04:37,218
What did you think?

826
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:43,487
There is a volcano that can bury the
cemetery before we reach it, before we see it, before we preserve its memory.

827
01:04:43,487 --> 01:04:47,566
Excuse me, is that what we do?
Because nobody told me, when were you gonna tell me?

828
01:04:47,566 --> 01:04:48,962
Why did I tell you that?

829
01:04:48,962 --> 01:04:51,113
We're in it together
now, I came to save you

830
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:52,762
You know you're not Dash, right?

831
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:55,170
You don't ride a white horse and save people

832
01:04:55,170 --> 01:05:01,055
You spray yourself bronze and stand in
front of the machines that extract the air and it's all great for you

833
01:05:01,055 --> 01:05:03,895
How do
you know the truth about my personality?

834
01:05:03,895 --> 01:05:06,962
I know
you well, you're an obvious person, Alan.

835
01:05:06,962 --> 01:05:08,207
Well, then who am I?

836
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:13,647
I feel... well

837
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:17,045
I was a handsome boy who was
popular in college stadiums

838
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:21,665
And when you found yourself in an
unknown place with no hope of becoming a star, you came to Los Angeles.

839
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:24,605
Then one day a woman
appeared who could not publish her book on colonialism

840
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:27,428
The Spaniard in
the Atlantic decided to write a romance novel

841
01:05:27,428 --> 01:05:29,746
She
randomly chose you to be the cover model

842
01:05:29,746 --> 01:05:33,365
And fortunately for you and her
luck, the novel became widely known

843
01:05:33,365 --> 01:05:37,364
She continued with her trivial writings,
and you continued with the photo sessions

844
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:42,001
And as you know,
none of us became what we wished to be in the end

845
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:46,061
Until one day we died in the bush

846
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:51,619
On one of the
Atlantic islands you wrote about years ago, right?

847
01:05:52,619 --> 01:06:03,869
Subtransl.ed balloumowgly

848
01:06:04,883 --> 01:06:08,855
It's called
Sarasota, by the way, and it's not an unknown place

849
01:06:08,855 --> 01:06:11,274
Where I lived with my mother and two sisters

850
01:06:11,274 --> 01:06:15,982
And yes, I started my modeling
career to get away from there

851
01:06:15,982 --> 01:06:21,226
The only job I could think of was to
go to all the places I dreamed of going

852
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:25,774
Then finally to Los Angeles,
where I was modeling the cover of your romance novel

853
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:29,615
I was so embarrassed
when one of my friends saw me with a wig

854
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:33,937
on your cover
that I stopped talking to them for months

855
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:44,330
There was a woman running up to me
and she's so happy and saying "Dash"

856
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:51,479
I thought, How can I be ashamed of
something that makes people so happy?

857
01:06:54,248 --> 01:06:56,214
Do whatever you want, Loretta.

858
01:06:58,124 --> 01:07:02,888
But don't underestimate the
fans of your work and describe it with trivial writings

859
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:05,089
This is not fair to them

860
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:12,143
do you know? It's ironic to think
that you're the only one who wouldn't judge a book by its cover

861
01:07:15,942 --> 01:07:19,220
You mean judge a book by the viewer's cover?

862
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:51,073
(right Now)

863
01:07:51,073 --> 01:07:52,887
(right Now)

864
01:08:04,439 --> 01:08:06,116
There are two of them

865
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:15,154
I'm
here, Loretta. - Alan.

866
01:08:16,245 --> 01:08:19,490
Motorcycles
and pistols Motorcycles and pistols

867
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,066
Let's go from this direction

868
01:08:21,066 --> 01:08:22,962
Don't shoot

869
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,838
Just
give them the manuscript. - I can't.

870
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:32,855
Yes you can,
just say “here it is” and throw it at them

871
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:35,915
I'll make sure they let us go

872
01:08:36,183 --> 01:08:39,199
How do they find us?
Because of your disco ball gown.

873
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,048
We have to think of a trick.
- I have an idea.

874
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:44,579
We dig a hole and then make a
sound and say "come here" or you can imitate the sound of a bird

875
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:48,155
No,
I have a plan - Please, Alan, let me think.

876
01:08:48,155 --> 01:08:51,524
...please just let me think of me

877
01:08:51,524 --> 01:08:54,497
Hey, they
were shooting at you - Yeah, so we're hiding.

878
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,370
They didn't shoot me
they need my wits

879
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:03,967
What? I don't think you
hear what you're saying

880
01:09:03,967 --> 01:09:07,567
I will protect
you as a shield. - I will protect you.

881
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:09,868
Why?  Because I'm a woman?  This is sexist

882
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:14,862
Using women as shields
wasn't really the change she was seeking (Gloria Seinfeld)

883
01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:17,899
Do you mean Gloria
Steinem? - whatever -

884
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:19,833
Tell me about sexism from
a men's point of view

885
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:23,794
Oh my God, I'm a woman, I can't talk
about anything from a men's point of view

886
01:09:23,794 --> 01:09:27,888
I belong to the feminist movement
and so I believe that a woman can do anything that men can do

887
01:09:27,888 --> 01:09:30,302
We should
stay here until they get tired of chasing us

888
01:09:30,302 --> 01:09:32,184
Why don't you just listen to my plan?

889
01:09:32,184 --> 01:09:35,648
We're in a lot more
trouble than just loving you to take off your shirts

890
01:09:35,648 --> 01:09:37,874
I'm not sure about that

891
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,137
three

892
01:10:10,532 --> 01:10:11,282
yes

893
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:21,506
It wasn't really what I had planned

894
01:10:21,506 --> 01:10:23,515
...I just wanted to stop

895
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,579
I think the wind caused that

896
01:10:25,579 --> 01:10:29,782
I think we're the reason,
we're the ones who did it, we only dealt with one guy

897
01:10:29,782 --> 01:10:33,780
I think we just
wanted to stop him but the other guy didn't move

898
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,063
So... he is to blame

899
01:10:36,063 --> 01:10:39,044
Even if
we weren't here, that would have happened

900
01:10:39,044 --> 01:10:40,739
Why didn't he stop before the slope?

901
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:43,428
But they were
wearing...helmets, so maybe

902
01:10:43,428 --> 01:10:46,948
But the rest of their bodies don't wear
helmets, they only wear them on their heads

903
01:10:46,948 --> 01:10:49,269
They were driving recklessly, right?

904
01:10:49,269 --> 01:10:51,896
No harsh handling of bicycles

905
01:10:51,896 --> 01:10:54,706
It is
forbidden to do bad things on bicycles

906
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,495
Maybe they are fine

907
01:10:59,495 --> 01:11:02,345
Yes, maybe no, it's okay

908
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:06,692
...it's okay,
you know, things happen like this, let's go

909
01:11:08,577 --> 01:11:10,565
You can't bring back the torn pieces

910
01:11:10,565 --> 01:11:12,915
it's rented

911
01:11:27,648 --> 01:11:29,841
What more can I do?

912
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:32,083
You've done a lot so far, Beth.

913
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:35,205
My poor beloved grandmother has lost her sight

914
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:42,300
The release of the book was disastrous
and I invested all my money in it so I am completely broke now

915
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:48,014
Most of all, I lost
a writer. Who would allow such a thing to happen?

916
01:11:48,014 --> 01:11:51,883
You
remind me of my girlfriend Randy, Beth.

917
01:11:51,883 --> 01:11:57,813
She always takes
care of others and never takes care of herself

918
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,063
Isn't that right, Randy?

919
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:03,633
She's like this little psychotherapist

920
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:05,866
I laugh so hard at that

921
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:08,603
...after you're done with your girlfriend's order

922
01:12:08,603 --> 01:12:10,184
What do you think of going to a beach?

923
01:12:10,184 --> 01:12:12,677
What?
- I have something to do in Hawaii.

924
01:12:12,677 --> 01:12:15,354
It is not necessary for her to come with us

925
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:20,362
Well,
well, you can come with us, it's so funny

926
01:12:20,362 --> 01:12:24,571
Let me ask you something,
we're sitting here talking, who's flying the plane?

927
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:26,616
Autopilot - what?
-

928
01:12:26,616 --> 01:12:29,461
Go to the cockpit
and drive the plane

929
01:12:29,461 --> 01:12:30,461
good

930
01:12:31,611 --> 01:12:35,106
It's time to go down...

931
01:12:35,106 --> 01:12:37,099
No,
no, take the goat please take the goat

932
01:13:20,831 --> 01:13:24,407
That Englishman kidnapped her

933
01:13:25,587 --> 01:13:30,125
Hi, I'm
Beth, leave a message and I'll call you back

934
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:32,243
hello beth

935
01:13:36,297 --> 01:13:37,017
listen

936
01:13:41,648 --> 01:13:45,964
I'm sorry I spoiled the book tour

937
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:53,078
I was scared and... selfish

938
01:13:53,078 --> 01:13:56,214
Well, Alan came, I'll call you back

939
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:58,769
<i>Police Department</i>

940
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:04,234
The police will look for Fairfax
and protect us while we're here

941
01:14:04,234 --> 01:14:06,579
Did
they say anything about our time here?

942
01:14:06,579 --> 01:14:13,750
They'll try to book a plane for us
tonight, and until then we can clean ourselves up and change our clothes

943
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,750
good

944
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:19,900
good

945
01:15:14,947 --> 01:15:16,578
Come on

946
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:19,924
Dance with your husband

947
01:15:19,924 --> 01:15:21,815
not my husband

948
01:15:21,815 --> 01:15:23,454
It's okay.
- No, let's dance.

949
01:15:23,454 --> 01:15:26,354
No, no, she
doesn't like it, the shoes she doesn't have

950
01:15:26,354 --> 01:15:29,388
In fact, that's
the only thing that fits with these shoes

951
01:15:29,388 --> 01:15:31,308
You don't have to

952
01:15:31,308 --> 01:15:33,559
It's okay, it's okay

953
01:15:33,559 --> 01:15:35,388
Oh really?

954
01:16:53,278 --> 01:16:55,371
What does the song say?

955
01:16:57,325 --> 01:16:59,601
It's part of the heritage

956
01:17:00,163 --> 01:17:06,655
This song is about a
woman whose mother died and did not want to leave her

957
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:10,208
So she slept next to her and she never woke up

958
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,765
Sounds like a scary song

959
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:16,431
The idea of ​​imagining the future
without the person with whom you planned to continue your life

960
01:17:28,203 --> 01:17:30,248
What is that?

961
01:17:32,078 --> 01:17:38,486
Excuse me, was the last sentence in
the song: Who is crying next to me?

962
01:17:41,092 --> 01:17:44,373
The island
will cry for me, a well of endless tears

963
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:47,472
What is the "endless well of
tears"? Is it a real place?

964
01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:49,649
It's a stream

965
01:17:50,911 --> 01:17:52,742
Thank you very much, thank you

966
01:17:52,742 --> 01:17:55,129
Come on, let's go - what's up?
-

967
01:17:56,715 --> 01:18:02,449
It is written on the chart that the
treasure of King (Kalaman) is buried in the well of endless tears

968
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,922
I thought it was a metaphor

969
01:18:04,922 --> 01:18:06,726
But it is not

970
01:18:06,726 --> 01:18:09,721
The
well of endless tears is a real place

971
01:18:09,721 --> 01:18:11,839
It's a stream

972
01:18:11,839 --> 01:18:14,307
There is a stream on the map

973
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:17,361
I think the cemetery is there

974
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:19,949
This is much better than your novels.
- What? -

975
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:24,011
No, I didn't mean it, not in that sense.
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

976
01:18:25,642 --> 01:18:27,741
What? No
- I can see your enthusiasm.

977
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:31,136
...that would be crazy, I just wanted to

978
01:18:31,136 --> 01:18:35,293
It's
just that we're so close to him, we can't

979
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:40,137
This is your
story, and you are the one who wanted to write it

980
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:44,219
I just want to know
where it is and if everything that happens makes sense

981
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,666
Well, let's go

982
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:49,773
There will be no harm in one day, at sunrise we
will go in search of the endless well of tears

983
01:18:49,773 --> 01:18:52,993
What if we don't find anything?
- what's the problem? We will have tried

984
01:18:52,993 --> 01:18:54,447
What about Fairfax?

985
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:57,279
The police
are looking for Fairfax to arrest him

986
01:18:57,754 --> 01:19:00,367
This is
crazy. Yeah, but look at your enthusiasm.

987
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:03,649
It's
the first time I've seen you so brave

988
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:05,877
full of life

989
01:19:05,877 --> 01:19:09,774
I'll tell
them we've changed our plan, I won't be late

990
01:19:14,462 --> 01:19:16,649
I see you met my friend here

991
01:19:16,649 --> 01:19:22,890
Tell me you're going to get off on
a plane without even saying goodbye

992
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:25,513
I said it is impossible

993
01:19:25,513 --> 01:19:31,400
And Loretta wouldn't do something like
that, especially since she's the only one who can lead me to the cemetery

994
01:19:34,177 --> 01:19:36,705
Don't press my hand

995
01:19:38,217 --> 01:19:40,395
keep your hands off me

996
01:19:43,169 --> 01:19:46,701
I want a car, does anyone own a car?

997
01:19:56,795 --> 01:19:59,303
I want
a car, I can exchange it for a watch

998
01:19:59,303 --> 01:20:01,156
It's a very expensive watch, do you have a car?

999
01:20:01,156 --> 01:20:03,285
It's a Bvlgari brand that glows
in the dark and is water-resistant

1000
01:20:03,285 --> 01:20:05,731
I have a motorcycle

1001
01:20:18,072 --> 01:20:23,161
Fabulous, isn't it?
I thought why your tank doesn't have a mini bar?

1002
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:25,539
Do you want a drink?

1003
01:20:25,539 --> 01:20:27,040
Would you stop it?

1004
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,277
Yes, I'm afraid he holds you grudges

1005
01:20:30,277 --> 01:20:33,013
Because of
an accident involving his friend's motorcycle

1006
01:20:33,013 --> 01:20:34,417
Why do you do that?

1007
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:36,910
I want something that no one else has

1008
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:39,426
...when my father gave

1009
01:20:41,769 --> 01:20:48,815
I was saying when my father...given
his empire to my little brother

1010
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:57,929
Who is this?

1011
01:21:06,288 --> 01:21:08,860
Is this a Ken doll
on a motorcycle?

1012
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,222
I know him from somewhere

1013
01:21:11,222 --> 01:21:12,788
I doubt it

1014
01:21:12,788 --> 01:21:18,264
Because what you're looking at right now
is someone highly trained to face battles

1015
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:24,297
Learn a lot
in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait and Sarasota.

1016
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:26,829
His skin is
great and he does not suffer from dermatitis

1017
01:21:26,829 --> 01:21:30,402
And it won't stop until I'm safe

1018
01:21:30,402 --> 01:21:36,059
So stop this tank, unless you want
to perish like his friends did

1019
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:39,497
He is responsible for their death

1020
01:21:39,497 --> 01:21:46,012
You may not
have met him before but remember their death

1021
01:22:00,432 --> 01:22:04,040
Who is this?  who is he?  I've seen it before

1022
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:07,463
No no

1023
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:10,897
That's your novel's cover model, isn't it?
Yes, I knew that

1024
01:22:10,897 --> 01:22:13,756
One of you can go upstairs and kill him

1025
01:22:13,756 --> 01:22:17,933
And kill him in
a creative way, I love seeing cute people lose

1026
01:22:19,345 --> 01:22:22,115
I think I'll have this drink

1027
01:22:23,789 --> 01:22:24,539
Die

1028
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:27,805
Do you mind if I fill the cup?

1029
01:22:27,805 --> 01:22:31,636
No, it's okay,
my God, is this your first time holding a cup?

1030
01:22:32,379 --> 01:22:34,387
What would
Jack Trainer do in a situation like this?

1031
01:22:36,165 --> 01:22:40,394
It's hot in here, isn't it hot?

1032
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:43,467
Are you trying to be sexy?
This is so weird, please stop it

1033
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:46,054
I can burn your world

1034
01:22:56,159 --> 01:23:00,395
sleep, sleep, no, no, sleep

1035
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:05,393
Time out

1036
01:23:12,522 --> 01:23:15,481
No, don't shoot her, I need her

1037
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:19,279
My God

1038
01:23:24,283 --> 01:23:27,002
Get your foot away, get your foot away

1039
01:23:30,446 --> 01:23:32,705
Sleep you bastard

1040
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,116
big man

1041
01:23:46,017 --> 01:23:47,481
Faster

1042
01:23:51,863 --> 01:23:53,649
you ride

1043
01:23:53,649 --> 01:23:55,728
He or I?

1044
01:23:59,661 --> 01:24:06,871
This isn't one of
your boring, fairy tales, Loretta, it's real life

1045
01:24:07,325 --> 01:24:11,322
We'll kill him, tell us where the cemetery is

1046
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:25,922
<i>The headquarters of the special care and protection of tourists</i>

1047
01:24:25,922 --> 01:24:29,556
Hello, whoever is in charge here,
send the administrators to this place

1048
01:24:29,556 --> 01:24:31,200
this place

1049
01:24:31,986 --> 01:24:33,884
We are closed

1050
01:24:33,884 --> 01:24:35,824
did you shut down?

1051
01:24:37,468 --> 01:24:40,396
Did you know
I've been napping for a year and a half?

1052
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:43,158
a year and a half ago

1053
01:24:43,158 --> 01:24:50,663
I try to work as hard as I can without
rest and have been working hard since before my girlfriend was kidnapped

1054
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,097
I rest and drink
wine that I don't even have the energy to drink

1055
01:24:59,097 --> 01:25:01,251
I want a massage

1056
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:08,229
I want someone to massage my
shoulders and my feet at the same time

1057
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:15,278
I don't care if it doesn't make
sense from a logistical point of view because I did my best

1058
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:25,867
So I'm kind of asking you
to open up for a few more minutes... because if we don't

1059
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:31,312
One of my very best
friends is going to die, she and her book cover model

1060
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,734
I don't see any ways

1061
01:25:55,963 --> 01:25:57,758
What about caves?

1062
01:25:58,222 --> 01:26:00,033
This is very dangerous

1063
01:26:00,033 --> 01:26:03,276
Well, we'll be careful then

1064
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:17,919
Come on

1065
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:23,371
from here

1066
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:26,115
It's my rule not to go
into any scary caves

1067
01:26:37,095 --> 01:26:38,207
(Julian)

1068
01:26:38,207 --> 01:26:40,063
Is his name Julian?

1069
01:26:40,063 --> 01:26:43,404
He fits the names Buck or Bruce.

1070
01:26:43,404 --> 01:26:45,251
You go

1071
01:26:48,475 --> 01:26:51,544
Go, don't be afraid

1072
01:27:20,478 --> 01:27:22,529
Watch your step

1073
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,151
good

1074
01:27:30,765 --> 01:27:33,111
We must not make his death for nothing

1075
01:27:33,519 --> 01:27:36,053
Moving forward - how do we move forward?
we will die -

1076
01:27:36,053 --> 01:27:38,497
We won't back down now after all

1077
01:27:54,176 --> 01:27:58,432
Listen, let's
go back to the boat so no one else dies

1078
01:27:58,432 --> 01:28:03,472
No, no, there's a breeze,
there's a tunnel, it might lead us to the cemetery

1079
01:28:03,472 --> 01:28:06,351
Nobody's
going to - Speak for yourself, come on.

1080
01:28:06,351 --> 01:28:07,548
It's like playing slides

1081
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,417
He might
chase a rock - or the back of a troll -

1082
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:13,900
...you're
going down the back, no, I mean the tunnel

1083
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,473
Why is she? -
Because you'll stay in the cave to warn us.

1084
01:28:16,473 --> 01:28:18,230
...that's impossible, I can't

1085
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:21,584
Tell us
when you arrive or we will kill your friend

1086
01:28:21,584 --> 01:28:23,819
Hey, am I in trouble?

1087
01:28:24,103 --> 01:28:24,823
decent

1088
01:29:01,584 --> 01:29:04,188
I can't reach, sorry

1089
01:29:05,166 --> 01:29:06,728
What?

1090
01:29:06,728 --> 01:29:08,497
Do you smell this scent?

1091
01:29:08,497 --> 01:29:12,207
You mean the smell of crap that's been
here for centuries? Of course I smell this

1092
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:14,298
You should take a deep breath, woman

1093
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,510
Here you are

1094
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:22,865
You can, Loretta.

1095
01:29:35,362 --> 01:29:38,487
I think I see a way out

1096
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:42,397
My God

1097
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:49,822
It arrived

1098
01:29:49,822 --> 01:29:52,024
It arrived

1099
01:29:52,024 --> 01:29:54,366
See?  It is very safe

1100
01:29:54,643 --> 01:29:56,625
go, your turn

1101
01:29:57,867 --> 01:30:01,459
I'm
crossing the tunnel, stay there, okay?

1102
01:31:04,995 --> 01:31:07,401
Why did they build it in this place?

1103
01:31:08,019 --> 01:31:11,900
How are they supposed
to worship or remember Him without seeing Him?

1104
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,680
It's not supposed to

1105
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:17,116
This is not a trace of Claman's power.

1106
01:31:17,933 --> 01:31:20,961
It is the lair of a sad woman

1107
01:31:20,961 --> 01:31:24,138
Queen Taha used to come
here for her dead lover

1108
01:31:25,469 --> 01:31:27,957
She wanted to be alone

1109
01:31:28,598 --> 01:31:34,253
Taha doesn't want us
to be here - Just shut up, Ravi. It's just the volcano.

1110
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:36,705
Come on

1111
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:44,484
We have to continue

1112
01:31:51,627 --> 01:31:53,495
Well, let's go strong

1113
01:31:53,871 --> 01:31:55,754
open it

1114
01:31:55,754 --> 01:31:57,166
Don't bother them

1115
01:31:57,166 --> 01:32:01,276
You're going to wear the crown,
come on, we didn't come that far to pay respects to the dead

1116
01:32:01,276 --> 01:32:03,268
I cannot

1117
01:32:06,274 --> 01:32:08,136
Sorry for that

1118
01:32:29,101 --> 01:32:31,113
What is that?

1119
01:32:32,489 --> 01:32:35,303
Are these sea shells?

1120
01:32:35,303 --> 01:32:38,612
The crown is made of seashells?

1121
01:32:38,612 --> 01:32:40,432
Where is the treasure?

1122
01:32:41,036 --> 01:32:42,951
She hugs him

1123
01:32:45,207 --> 01:32:47,392
Do you mean the dead man?

1124
01:32:53,596 --> 01:32:55,349
look

1125
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:58,996
It's their courtship texts

1126
01:32:59,257 --> 01:33:02,634
Claman
was looking for something on the island

1127
01:33:05,412 --> 01:33:07,612
rare seashells

1128
01:33:07,612 --> 01:33:16,553
To prove his love for her, he would bring her a coincidence
every day of the year, then gather them in a crown that was red like the fire of their love.

1129
01:33:16,553 --> 01:33:20,089
Until the day he proposed to her marriage came

1130
01:33:20,089 --> 01:33:22,213
It was never about jewelry

1131
01:33:22,213 --> 01:33:26,104
Claman and Taha's
fortune was not material

1132
01:33:27,691 --> 01:33:32,149
It was their
love, that's the point, and that's enough

1133
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:41,863
Is that all? All that
time and money wasted on an old, ridiculous metaphor?

1134
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:46,829
We have to go

1135
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:50,090
No, no, you'll stay here

1136
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:54,076
Since you both
see it as beautiful and poetic then you will live

1137
01:33:54,076 --> 01:33:58,086
The rest of your lives contemplate
the richness of that metaphor

1138
01:33:58,086 --> 01:34:00,312
Get in - what?
-

1139
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:03,651
All
right, okay? - Enter the cemetery.

1140
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:06,158
Perhaps it
is better to bury alive than to bury the dead

1141
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:11,658
do you know
that? It's really shameful, great story

1142
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:13,250
But you will not live to tell it to anyone

1143
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:14,914
Come
on, but they're going to die.

1144
01:34:14,914 --> 01:34:18,364
And you too,
if you don't stop being sensitive, come here

1145
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,547
It's okay, no worse than my
nightmares when I was 14

1146
01:34:35,343 --> 01:34:38,994
Why are you going so fast?
We are not in a race

1147
01:34:43,604 --> 01:34:46,080
Oh my God, what are you doing?  come back here

1148
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:51,015
You may own the island,
but now you are its slave

1149
01:34:51,383 --> 01:34:53,581
You can't leave me here

1150
01:34:54,882 --> 01:34:57,599
come back ravi

1151
01:34:59,507 --> 01:35:01,596
I want a boat

1152
01:35:11,389 --> 01:35:12,981
stop, stop

1153
01:35:18,752 --> 01:35:23,795
Have you seen a woman
with black hair and a tight dress with sequins?

1154
01:35:23,795 --> 01:35:27,880
No, is she in trouble?

1155
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,434
It's funny

1156
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:46,814
I thought a situation like
this would be romantic

1157
01:35:46,814 --> 01:35:48,224
Oh really?

1158
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:54,873
Do you mean to stay in a grave? Or dumping
us with lava? Or stay with the dead?

1159
01:35:54,873 --> 01:35:59,656
I mean,
stay next to lost love, like Taha did.

1160
01:36:07,276 --> 01:36:12,203
Sorry I
couldn't save you Sorry I couldn't be Dash

1161
01:36:12,203 --> 01:36:16,531
You're
right, you're not like Dash at all

1162
01:36:16,531 --> 01:36:20,218
You didn't take your white horse and save me

1163
01:36:20,218 --> 01:36:25,162
I even took a borrowed
scooter with a broken muffler

1164
01:36:26,318 --> 01:36:27,068
yes

1165
01:36:27,828 --> 01:36:30,624
I couldn't have
made Dash like you

1166
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:37,195
Because
I've never known someone like Alan.

1167
01:36:37,195 --> 01:36:41,544
I was so afraid that
life would hurt my feelings again so I stopped living

1168
01:36:41,544 --> 01:36:43,816
I couldn't
see the good things in front of my eyes

1169
01:36:43,816 --> 01:36:47,584
I'm so
sorry I didn't notice you were there before

1170
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:49,379
I have a confession too

1171
01:36:49,379 --> 01:36:54,178
I really liked the direction
our story was taking

1172
01:36:54,178 --> 01:36:56,995
Maybe I
wanted to know what was going to happen

1173
01:36:57,988 --> 01:37:00,901
The Adventures of Loretta and Alan

1174
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:06,794
That
would have been a great name, for sure.

1175
01:37:15,295 --> 01:37:17,124
Ravi must have left it to us

1176
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:19,918
How did you forget that
lever? You will help us out

1177
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:23,197
He left her on
purpose - Wow, I've always felt he was a good person.

1178
01:37:23,197 --> 01:37:26,821
one two Three

1179
01:37:26,821 --> 01:37:30,997
I wish he hadn't left
us here from the start

1180
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,046
"Pleasure comes after hardship"

1181
01:37:59,972 --> 01:38:02,217
Pleasure comes after hardship

1182
01:38:08,037 --> 01:38:09,981
We will climb these trees

1183
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:15,202
Don't
wait, you don't have to burn trees, okay

1184
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,557
We can go back to the tunnel

1185
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,422
No, we can't go back to the tunnel

1186
01:38:26,885 --> 01:38:29,270
I think I can do it

1187
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,521
There is a
current, we can follow it to lead us to the ocean

1188
01:38:32,521 --> 01:38:34,591
How will we know what
is on the other side?

1189
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:36,136
We won't know

1190
01:38:37,586 --> 01:38:39,841
There is only one way to find out

1191
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,564
I wouldn't care if I got
a rash. - Really? -

1192
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:05,313
(right Now)

1193
01:39:13,235 --> 01:39:14,833
(right Now)

1194
01:39:51,772 --> 01:39:53,254
(right Now)

1195
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:56,632
(right Now)

1196
01:39:56,632 --> 01:39:58,512
(right Now)

1197
01:40:01,088 --> 01:40:03,123
oh my god, you're alive

1198
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:05,814
Yes
- I thought I caused your death.

1199
01:40:08,194 --> 01:40:11,440
Is this Beth?
- (Loretta) -

1200
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,444
(Beth)

1201
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:22,575
You're here, Beth.

1202
01:40:23,067 --> 01:40:24,437
Why are you here?

1203
01:40:24,437 --> 01:40:27,498
I told you I'm on your back, girl

1204
01:40:27,743 --> 01:40:32,117
I'm so sorry, I messed up your dress

1205
01:40:32,117 --> 01:40:33,944
What?

1206
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:36,167
No, I will tell you later

1207
01:40:36,167 --> 01:40:40,852
I found an Englishman in the cave
and thought he was a little boy but it turned out he had a beard

1208
01:40:40,852 --> 01:40:44,232
It's Fairfax that kidnapped us, Beth.

1209
01:40:44,232 --> 01:40:46,801
He's
a bad guy, Beth, he killed Turner.

1210
01:40:48,303 --> 01:40:49,913
stop it

1211
01:40:57,564 --> 01:41:00,459
I'm at your back, girl

1212
01:41:01,921 --> 01:41:05,953
Why were you running?
It's a ship, this guy is so funny

1213
01:41:05,953 --> 01:41:07,156
got U

1214
01:41:07,156 --> 01:41:08,697
We'll take you to the island

1215
01:41:08,697 --> 01:41:11,006
I caught you, no, I didn't catch you

1216
01:41:11,006 --> 01:41:13,101
We'll take you both, you'll be fine

1217
01:41:13,101 --> 01:41:17,855
They found sanctuary
on a nearby rock and lifted it out of the water

1218
01:41:17,855 --> 01:41:20,980
His strong
arms pulled her and tightened her body

1219
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:22,281
Then he (Alan) whispered to her,

1220
01:41:22,281 --> 01:41:25,276
You are safe now

1221
01:41:27,491 --> 01:41:32,147
At that moment,
Loretta felt that a new adventure was about to begin

1222
01:41:32,147 --> 01:41:33,399
<i>Novel (Crown of Fire)</i>

1223
01:41:33,399 --> 01:41:39,103
The desire to miraculously escape from them made
her heart beat and ignited her desire for him

1224
01:41:39,103 --> 01:41:43,612
She was thirsty for the hot
lava that was emanating from

1225
01:41:43,612 --> 01:41:47,602
They taught you not to stop at the good part

1226
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:50,071
It's not something you haven't read before

1227
01:41:50,071 --> 01:41:54,716
Didn't I tell you?
It is the most beautiful beach in the world

1228
01:41:54,716 --> 01:41:58,151
Maybe
later I can show you the Enchanted Bay

1229
01:41:58,151 --> 01:42:00,191
No, you can take Randy.

1230
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:03,712
Remember, our friendship is a virginal friendship

1231
01:42:03,712 --> 01:42:06,610
virginity?  I love the pronunciation of this word

1232
01:42:06,610 --> 01:42:09,540
I don't know
what it means but I like the way it is pronounced

1233
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,700
There you are, Randy.

1234
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,469
Honey.
- You're an angel, thank you.

1235
01:42:16,469 --> 01:42:18,456
How do you know I'm an angel?

1236
01:42:29,874 --> 01:42:32,746
Great
way to end a book tour, isn't it?

1237
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:40,237
You know, I have
a phrase I like to use in situations like this

1238
01:42:42,045 --> 01:42:44,797
"What's Next?"

1239
01:42:44,797 --> 01:42:48,430
It is a Latin phrase meaning: What next?

1240
01:42:49,777 --> 01:42:52,065
"What's your opinion?"

1241
01:42:53,435 --> 01:42:55,488
Restaurant (Boca de Bebo)

1242
01:42:58,321 --> 01:43:00,441
Yes, I don't know anything about Latin

1243
01:43:00,441 --> 01:43:03,289
I use it in these
moments, like now

1244
01:43:04,216 --> 01:43:05,855
So what's the next step?

1245
01:43:05,855 --> 01:43:09,484
How will you write the next novel?
- I don't know, how would you write it? -

1246
01:43:09,484 --> 01:43:11,180
Do you really want me to write it?

1247
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:14,510
Try
- Ok, I'll write it down.

1248
01:43:14,811 --> 01:43:18,157
"We were there... standing on a beach"

1249
01:43:18,157 --> 01:43:20,392
Prepare
events for readers so they know how to start

1250
01:43:20,392 --> 01:43:24,144
Why are you laughing?
- I don't laugh, I smile -

1251
01:43:24,144 --> 01:43:31,994
There are palm trees above the brown
bark like the hair of a virgin girl

1252
01:43:31,994 --> 01:43:36,027
"And there's a dead jellyfish behind" - You're
just describing what you're actually seeing -

1253
01:43:36,027 --> 01:43:39,029
"He's nervous because he really likes her."

1254
01:43:43,268 --> 01:43:44,314
let's continue

1255
01:43:44,314 --> 01:43:47,343
He looks deeper into
her eyes and compares them to the pulse of the ocean

1256
01:43:47,343 --> 01:43:50,396
They are the only
thing that can compare to the pulse of the ocean

1257
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:52,029
"...and beats"

1258
01:43:52,029 --> 01:43:54,798
You can't use the word:
beats - why not? -

1259
01:43:54,798 --> 01:43:56,832
The beats don't happen that fast

1260
01:43:56,832 --> 01:43:58,192
But the chimes happen all the time

1261
01:43:58,192 --> 01:44:00,575
The beats don't happen
so fast but gradually

1262
01:44:00,575 --> 01:44:01,784
What makes your statement true?

1263
01:44:01,784 --> 01:44:04,766
It's something
about Chapter 4 that should be scaled appropriately

1264
01:44:04,766 --> 01:44:07,617
I guess
the beats in all seasons, it's just a beat

1265
01:44:07,617 --> 01:44:10,154
There is even a prelude to the beats

1266
01:44:10,154 --> 01:44:11,609
Just go to chapter 5

1267
01:44:11,609 --> 01:44:14,350
What if they kiss each other?
- Do you mean an ordinary kiss? -

1268
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:16,088
Yes, that
kiss is at the beginning of the chapters

1269
01:44:16,088 --> 01:44:18,288
...I have a good start

1270
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:28,584
Do you have any comments?
- Fantastic, as a first attempt to start a chapter -

1271
01:45:29,587 --> 01:45:31,989
{ the lost City }

1272
01:46:00,344 --> 01:46:05,990
Oh my God, oh God... you're dead, your brain came
out of your face and reached behind my throat

1273
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:08,440
It got in
my mouth...Don't say it got in my mouth.

1274
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,627
I tasted yours

1275
01:46:09,627 --> 01:46:15,546
We can only use
10% of our brain, so I moved on to the next 10%

1276
01:46:15,546 --> 01:46:18,481
So... are you okay?

1277
01:46:18,481 --> 01:46:20,463
one hundred percent

1278
01:46:20,463 --> 01:46:22,274
This means 10 percent

1279
01:46:22,274 --> 01:46:23,939
We thought you were dead

1280
01:46:23,939 --> 01:46:26,629
I usually have anger issues
that I need to get rid of

1281
01:46:30,978 --> 01:46:32,392
Nice to see you man

1282
01:46:32,392 --> 01:46:34,667
Well, let's turn our conversation down

1283
01:46:34,667 --> 01:46:39,653
We close our eyes and connect with ourselves

1284
01:46:39,653 --> 01:46:41,735
Wonderful

1285
01:46:41,735 --> 01:46:43,921
Wonderful

1286
01:46:48,921 --> 01:56:45,171
