00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,461
Buddusky!

2
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:20,478
Either of you guys seen Buddusky?

3
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,364
Buddusky!

4
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:39,669
What?

5
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:41,593
MAA sent me.

6
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,735
He wants to see you right away.

7
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:51,380
Tell MAA to go fuck himself.

8
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:54,746
Well, he said, "Right away."

9
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,043
Come on, Buddusky.

10
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:59,326
It's your ass if you don't.

11
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,198
Look, maybe your orders came through.

12
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:04,893
Come on, Buddusky!

13
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,251
It's your ass.

14
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,324
Bullshit.

15
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:20,632
My ass!

16
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,052
Mulhall!

17
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,382
Master-at-arms wants
to see you right away.

18
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:29,433
I ain't going on no shit detail.

19
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,454
Come on! It's my ass if you don't.

20
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:33,688
I ain't going on no shit detail!

21
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:36,122
It's your ass too. Come on, Mule.

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,175
Maybe your orders came through.

23
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,375
Tell the MAA you couldn't find me.

24
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:42,397
He knows where you are.

25
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,525
When you're in the Navy
and in transit...

26
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,482
...nobody knows where you are!

27
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,685
Go tell the MAA to fuck himself.

28
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:51,926
I ain't going on no shit detail!

29
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,427
Morning.

30
00:02:57,918 --> 00:03:00,308
You are one lucky son of a bitch...

31
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,494
...Bad Ass!

32
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:05,273
You are one lucky son of a bitch!

33
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,533
Where am I going, Chief?

34
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,426
How come you're so lucky, Buddusky?

35
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,653
You're another lucky son of a bitch.

36
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,932
You dudes pulled
temporary duty as chasers.

37
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,259
Where to?

38
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,151
Portsmouth Naval Prison.

39
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,645
- Who we taking?
- Seaman.

40
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:28,344
Used to be.

41
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,007
Meadows, Lawrence M.
Drew eight years and a D.D.

42
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:37,470
Jesus, what the hell did he do?
Kill the old man?

43
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:42,392
Come on inside.

44
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,694
Sweek!
Get these old boys some coffee.

45
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,104
All right, Chief.

46
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:48,760
Who'd he kill, Chief?

47
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,261
Didn't kill nobody. Robbery.

48
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:56,947
How much did he lift?

49
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,456
Forty dollars.

50
00:03:58,654 --> 00:03:59,996
Forty dollars!

51
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,435
Forty dollars.

52
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,791
You're shitting me!

53
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:07,064
I wouldn't shit you.

54
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:09,787
You're my favorite turd.

55
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:12,979
Jesus!

56
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,252
Eight years and a D.D. for $40.

57
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,778
I thought they only pulled that
shit in the Army!

58
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,713
You see, he tried...

59
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,529
...to lift the polio contribution box.

60
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:34,579
Polio box is the old man's old lady's...

61
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:37,204
...favorite do-gooder project.

62
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:42,168
She's responsible for all the polio
contributions on the base, you know?

63
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,154
Every year, they give her a plaque.

64
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:47,860
Along comes Meadows
and fucks over charity.

65
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:49,589
She took it very seriously.

66
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,852
- Jesus!
- Eight years.

67
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:55,258
That's very seriously.

68
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,725
You know what I mean?

69
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,908
Good duty for you guys.
Get to go to Washington...

70
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,478
...New York...

71
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:06,290
...Boston.

72
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,530
I'd trade places with you.

73
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:20,562
Listen...

74
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:24,473
...we could get this guy
to Portsmouth in two days.

75
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,619
Less.

76
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:30,201
They're going to give us a week.
You know what I mean?

77
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,292
So what?

78
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,454
We get there in two days, they won't
give us no week to get back.

79
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:35,767
Bullshit!

80
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:37,205
Besides...

81
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,894
...they got to give us
all that per diem, regardless.

82
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,995
That's money for you,
for me and for him.

83
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:47,191
We run this little shitbird's ass
all the way to the brig...

84
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,033
...save his per diem and ours,
split it and spend it on the way home.

85
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,637
You know what I mean?

86
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:58,941
Well, let's shag ass!

87
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:00,857
You're goddamn right!

88
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:06,139
Okay, Buddusky!
You're the honcho.

89
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:09,083
Carryall and driver are outside
to take you to the bus.

90
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,220
Here's the keys to the cuffs.

91
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:13,404
Each of you gets one key.

92
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:16,987
I want you both to sign
these chits for the pieces.

93
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:23,961
Here's one clip each.

94
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,039
Now, off the record...

95
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:28,245
...the old man has a
personal interest in this.

96
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:30,202
If you fuck up, you know what.

97
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:34,966
Are you all set, Cochise?

98
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:39,608
All right, shitbird. On your feet.

99
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,260
They're taking you to Portsmouth.
This is Petty Officer Buddusky.

100
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:45,308
This is Petty Officer Mulhall.

101
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:47,089
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,492
You know why they're chasers?

103
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,643
"Chasers," sir?

104
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:55,482
Do you know why they are
taking you to the brig?

105
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:56,954
No, sir.

106
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,826
They're bastards when they want to be,
and they always want to be.

107
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:04,370
Take my word for it, they aren't
about to take any shit from you.

108
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:07,191
If they do, they'll get reamed out,
and they know it.

109
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,490
- What?!
- Yes, sir!

110
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,478
All right, he's all yours.

111
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,939
It's colder than witch boob,
ain't it?

112
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,089
Coffee?

113
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:41,142
Let's make it.

114
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,664
Do you have to go to the head?

115
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,843
No, sir.

116
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:54,070
Be sure now, Meadows, because
from now on, whenever you go...

117
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,756
...one of us is going
to have to go with you.

118
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,698
I'm not going to kill myself.

119
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:04,057
Well, I don't think so...

120
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:06,897
...but you know how it is.

121
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,401
Yes, sir.
I don't need to use the head anyway.

122
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:12,400
Let's go.

123
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,497
Kill himself, huh?

124
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,849
Back of the bus.

125
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:11,795
Meadows.

126
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,044
Yes, sir?

127
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:16,084
I'm removing your handcuffs, Meadows.

128
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:19,993
Navy feels that on
certain kinds of vehicular transport...

129
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:22,709
...the prisoner shall have
the use of both his hands...

130
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:25,874
...to protect his self
in case of an accident.

131
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,376
- Ain't that right, Mulhane?
- That's right.

132
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:09,817
Where'd you get that candy bar?

133
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,539
I had it with me.

134
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:13,558
Okay, sailor.

135
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,644
I wasn't accusing you of nothing.

136
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:38,676
I had them with me!

137
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,328
Hey, man! I ain't said a word.

138
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:45,882
Take it easy.

139
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:48,409
You're making Mulhouse hungry.

140
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,687
Meadows?

141
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,926
- You want anything?
- No, sir.

142
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,599
Here, let me have that.

143
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:29,809
No, wait.

144
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:31,508
Give me this.

145
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:34,548
Ten cents.

146
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,759
Could you use a little help with that?

147
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,826
Thank you, young man.

148
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,864
Well, heading north,
huh, Mulehall?

149
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,007
Yeah, man...

150
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,094
...heading north.

151
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,716
My old stomping grounds.

152
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:04,212
Where you from, Mulehouse?

153
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:05,520
Hey, man.

154
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:07,703
It's "Mulhall."

155
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:10,355
Mulhall.

156
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:12,081
Understand?

157
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,170
Where you from, Mulhall?

158
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,378
Bogalusa.

159
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,206
Where's that?

160
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:23,441
Above New Orleans.

161
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:30,039
Hot down there, ain't it?

162
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,653
Listen, man...

163
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,443
...call me "Mule."

164
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,111
Everybody else does.

165
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:43,128
- "Mule," okay?
- Okay.

166
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:46,776
Yes, sir.

167
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,001
They always used to have trouble
with my name too.

168
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,074
Buddusky.

169
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,683
Always wanting to call me "Bad Ass."

170
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:00,025
"Bad Ass."

171
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,572
I am Bad Ass.

172
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:05,624
Bad Ass!

173
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,360
Is that true what the Chief said...

174
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:14,903
...about your getting...

175
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,675
...eight years and a dishonorable
discharge for stealing $40?

176
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:25,558
I didn't get no $40.

177
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:28,751
You didn't get it?

178
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,925
They caught me trying
to lift it from the box.

179
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,488
I didn't get it.

180
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:39,921
Jesus Christ! You mean to tell me
they gave you eight years and a D. D...

181
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,781
...and you didn't even get it?

182
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:45,491
Boy, they stuck it to him,
didn't they, Mule?

183
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,217
They sure as hell did.

184
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,264
They really stuck it to you, kid.

185
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:56,149
Stick it in and break it off.

186
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,601
Up your gigi with a wah-wah brush...

187
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,744
...stick it in and break it off.

188
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:03,604
Leave the kid alone.

189
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:05,716
I ain't bothering him.

190
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:08,434
Am I bothering you?

191
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,096
- No, sir.
- I ain't bothering him.

192
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,198
Just trying to be helpful.

193
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,497
So tell me,
how are you going to help him?

194
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:42,036
I want to ask you a few questions.

195
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,753
You don't have to answer,
but maybe I can help.

196
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,334
Come on!

197
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:55,608
Now, before this polio thing,
did you have a record?

198
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,360
No. Well, not with the Navy.

199
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:02,831
I got in trouble a couple of times
with the cops before I enlisted.

200
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:04,526
I see.

201
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:10,899
Was it in the nature
of a serious offense?

202
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:15,057
For example, was it in the nature
of a felony or a misdemeanor?

203
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,550
Well, it was in the nature
of shoplifting.

204
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:22,673
But I never was in jail,
if that's what you mean.

205
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:38,227
You know, Meadows...

206
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:42,993
...this eight years, it ain't
necessarily eight years.

207
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,911
- It isn't?
- No, it isn't.

208
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:49,366
They're going to knock two years off
for good behavior.

209
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,863
So that's six years right there.

210
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:53,326
Really?

211
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:06,482
That's something.

212
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:08,717
Ain't it?

213
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,901
At least we got a long train ride.

214
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,744
Man, I sure love trains!

215
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:43,248
It beats the shit out of sitting up
in Shit City, don't it?

216
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,343
Man, he didn't have those with him.

217
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:57,431
No, he didn't.

218
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,824
Why don't you take your coat off...?

219
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:09,742
Goddamn it! Halt, Meadows!

220
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,556
Halt!

221
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,869
I got him! All right, I got him!

222
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,309
You fucking asshole!

223
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:21,617
Let me go!

224
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:24,629
I got him!

225
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:26,963
I got him! I got him!

226
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,668
All right!
Don't you fucking move!

227
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:53,837
Sit down.

228
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:55,669
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,262
I'm sorry...

230
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,082
...for stealing the money.

231
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:03,124
I swear I didn't want it.

232
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:07,186
I'm always stealing junk I don't need.

233
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,995
It's all right.
It's all right, Meadows.

234
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:12,272
Come on. Be a man.

235
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:15,374
Quart bottles of hair tonic,
model cars...

236
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:18,835
I couldn't even build a model car.

237
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:21,743
Just crap...

238
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:23,569
...you know?

239
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,101
I had money on the books.
You can ask anybody.

240
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:32,114
But it's gone now...

241
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,637
...because I got forfeiture on pay
and everything...

242
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,288
But I had money.

243
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,757
It's okay, man.

244
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:43,568
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

245
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:53,460
The kid's crazy.

246
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:57,619
Yeah, he ought to see
a fucking psychiatrist.

247
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:59,376
What about now, man?

248
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,706
We got a nut on our hands right now.
You know what I mean?

249
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,170
We ought to take him off the train
at Washington...

250
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:12,628
...walk him around a bit
till he gets cooled off.

251
00:21:13,623 --> 00:21:15,478
He's a fucking mess.

252
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,956
Well, the last train
don't take off till 10:30.

253
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:38,518
Plenty of time for some good chow.

254
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,601
What do you want to eat, Meadows?

255
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,204
I don't know.

256
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:07,381
- What do you think?
- Looks good.

257
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,742
A little crowded.

258
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,852
What do you think, Meadows?

259
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,385
It's fine.

260
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:20,275
Think they'll melt the cheese on the
burgers? I like the cheese melted.

261
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:27,216
Do you see a booth in there, Mule?

262
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,437
It's a little crowded.

263
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:37,907
- Fuck the crowd. I'm hungry.
- Me too.

264
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,907
Maybe the next place, huh?

265
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,270
We're going to miss our train!

266
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:48,401
Who gives a shit?
So we miss the train.

267
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,388
We got five days!

268
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,532
Come on!

269
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,688
Is your word worth anything?

270
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:03,090
Sure it is.
As good as the next guy's.

271
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:05,108
The next guy's a prick!

272
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,849
What I mean is, Meadows...

273
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:13,389
...you aren't going to try and run away
while we're here in Washington, are you?

274
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:16,624
Forget about that.
Will you not bang into people...

275
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,611
...and embarrass us like that?

276
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:22,036
- And not steal anything?
- No, sir.

277
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:25,517
Goddamn it!

278
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:29,297
Hold still, Meadows.
Son of a bitch. All right.

279
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:32,497
No question about it.

280
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:35,564
- It almost gets you high.
- That's entertainment.

281
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:47,060
- Cheese melted enough for you?
- Sure.

282
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,284
It ain't melted at all.

283
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:52,787
Send it back!

284
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:54,672
Send the goddamn thing back.

285
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,488
- You're paying for it.
- It's all right.

286
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:59,634
Have it the way you want it.

287
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:00,779
Waiter!

288
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,359
Melt cheese for the chief, would you?

289
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,507
Thank you.

290
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:13,516
See, Meadows?

291
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:15,727
It's just as easy...

292
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,130
...to have it the way you want it.

293
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:24,586
Goddamn!

294
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:26,931
Hey!

295
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,067
Where's these malts at?

296
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,992
See what I mean, Meadows?

297
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,911
That's good.

298
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,210
Better catch that train.

299
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,926
We still got time for a beer.

300
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,916
Now wait a minute, man.

301
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,452
I ain't old enough.

302
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:48,716
You ain't old enough for what?

303
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,292
For a beer.

304
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:53,036
Everybody's old enough for a beer.

305
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:54,732
Ain't that right, Mule?

306
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:58,291
Well, I'm not.

307
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:02,315
I know a place right here.
It's nice and quiet.

308
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:06,548
Eight years and a D.D.,
at least we can buy the kid a beer.

309
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,524
Hi, Ed.

310
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:16,242
I'll take 30 cents worth of beer
in a glass...

311
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:18,226
...and the same for my shipmates.

312
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:19,851
Ed don't work here no more.

313
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,509
- Let me see your I.D. 's.
- How come?

314
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,400
Because this kid ain't old enough.

315
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,885
- Listen, pal...
- Listen yourself, pal.

316
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,281
The law says I have to serve him,
but...

317
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:34,261
I tell you what you do,
Mr. Citizen Bartender.

318
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:36,942
Take your beers
and ram them up your ass sideways.

319
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:39,728
- Can you dig it?
- Whoa there, sunshine.

320
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:43,821
We're going, so you can take your hand
off that horse cock...

321
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:46,095
...you got stashed under the bar.

322
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,642
How do you know I don't have
something with a little more bark to it?

323
00:25:51,156 --> 00:25:53,425
This redneck's talking about firearms.

324
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:56,491
I know that you ain't got nothing
but wood under there...

325
00:25:56,694 --> 00:25:59,149
...because I was here
when a certain sailor...

326
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,172
...got it up the side of his head.

327
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:03,471
What do you think about that, redneck?

328
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:09,100
The boss'd lose his license
for sure if I serve that kid.

329
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,083
I'll kick your ass around the block
for drill, man.

330
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:14,382
You try,
and I'll call the shore patrol.

331
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:18,736
I am the motherfucking shore patrol,
motherfucker!

332
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:21,105
I am the motherfucking
shore patrol!

333
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:22,545
Now give him a beer!

334
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:26,129
- I don't want...
- You're going to have a beer!

335
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,080
I don't feel like one right now.

336
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:30,001
Come on, man. Come on.

337
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,653
Come on, let's go!
Come on, man.

338
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,382
Man, you are a Bad Ass!

339
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,711
- I am, ain't I?
- Thought you'd blow his head off.

340
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,152
- What?
- You're a Bad Ass.

341
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:52,592
- A what?
- A Bad Ass!

342
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,315
- A what?!
- A Bad Ass!

343
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:57,712
You ain't leaving D.C.
till you got a belly full of beer!

344
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,756
Come on, kid! Jesus Christ!

345
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:03,404
Did you see that cracker asshole?

346
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:06,125
"The law says that I got to serve him,
but l..."

347
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,016
I thought he'd have a heart attack.

348
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,317
- Scared the shit out of him!
- He was scared!

349
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:11,793
He was ready to go!

350
00:27:11,988 --> 00:27:13,418
He was gone!

351
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:17,391
I'd like to drink a toast to Batman...

352
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:18,697
...Superman...

353
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:20,851
...and the Human Torch!

354
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:25,263
What's a Human Torch?

355
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,816
A pure, white, Southern American boy.

356
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:30,804
The Human Torch...

357
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,451
...when he goes like this...

358
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,299
...he throws a ball of flames
up on you...

359
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:39,697
...and the fucking building
goes up in an explosion.

360
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:44,649
And he had a littler guy
that flies around with him.

361
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:49,170
The best goddamn drink
in the world, isn't it?

362
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:57,870
Maybe we can sneak it on the train
and finish it off there.

363
00:27:58,069 --> 00:27:59,181
Know what I mean?

364
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:06,257
The train left
15 minutes ago.

365
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:13,328
What?

366
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:17,837
The train left 15 minutes ago.

367
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:20,337
Well, that's nice! That's fucking nice!

368
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,249
For Christ's sake,
give me a break!

369
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:28,240
We got five days.
We're on per diem.

370
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:31,085
I say what we do...

371
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,998
...is check into a hotel...

372
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:38,159
...hoist up a few more...

373
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:42,000
...have a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow we get on the train.

374
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,387
Sunday.

375
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:56,240
What the fuck are you laughing at?

376
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:59,760
Laughing at that silly
son of a bitch over there.

377
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:01,996
That's what I'm laughing at.

378
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,240
Come on...

379
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:10,093
...let's get ourselves into...

380
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,435
I got to go to the bathroom!

381
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:13,741
...a hotel room.

382
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:16,752
Wonderful idea.

383
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:19,852
Prisoner...

384
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,776
...on your feet.

385
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,889
Come on.

386
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:31,667
Cheer up!

387
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,424
Ain't this the life, Mule?

388
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:43,915
It sure beats freezing your ass
in the alley, don't it?

389
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,465
Beats the hell out of being
back in Shit City too, don't it?

390
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:51,953
I bet it even beats being
at Portsmouth too.

391
00:29:56,404 --> 00:29:57,745
You know, kid...

392
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,742
...you got a hell of a knack for
killing a conversation.

393
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,769
Just imagine that your hands...

394
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,649
...are the hands of a clock.

395
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:18,351
"A"...

396
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,482
...is twenty to six.

397
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,576
"B"...

398
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:25,172
...quarter to six.

399
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:26,160
"C"...

400
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:28,139
...ten to six.

401
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,136
"D"...

402
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,275
...straight up six o'clock...

403
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:32,654
Come on, man!

404
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:34,378
We're watching the movie.

405
00:30:36,243 --> 00:30:39,025
Meadows, you want to learn
how to be a signalman?

406
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:40,779
After the movie, man!

407
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:58,254
I always tell a new
semaphore personality this...

408
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:01,833
...to ensure that you send
a more perfect semaphore.

409
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:04,850
Ready?
I don't expect you to get it perfect.

410
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:08,938
This just happens to require
a great deal of manual dexterity.

411
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,088
All right.

412
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,962
That was very good, Meadows.

413
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,166
Very good indeed.

414
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,137
You must have a flair for this
sort of thing.

415
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,536
Some people do.

416
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:44,685
I do, for instance.
I have a flair for this sort of thing.

417
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,560
We got it.

418
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:55,632
We fucking got it, boys.

419
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,215
Here it is.

420
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:05,191
The truck that...

421
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:06,409
Very nice catch.

422
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,814
The truck that made your mama's son.

423
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:20,563
Motherfucking Jesus H. Christ!

424
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:31,207
You guys mind if I say something?

425
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,432
That guy at the bar...

426
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,701
...why did you get so mad at him?

427
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,055
I don't blame him
not giving me a beer.

428
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,127
Don't you never get mad at nobody?

429
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:50,097
Yeah, sure. I do. Yeah.

430
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,168
Who do you get mad at?

431
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,210
Well, not at somebody
who's doing their job.

432
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:56,621
Who then?

433
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:01,898
Injustice.

434
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,755
Bullshit!

435
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:07,790
You don't never get mad at nobody.
You're just a pussy.

436
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,481
I do too get mad.

437
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:13,551
Did you ever get mad at the old man
for what he done to you?

438
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:15,728
Well, he was just...

439
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:17,833
Doing his job.

440
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,208
They're going to take eight years
out of your life.

441
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,159
Six years. You said six.

442
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,985
What the fuck difference does it make?
You don't even care about it.

443
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:33,385
Hey, come on, Bad Ass.

444
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:35,495
- That don't help him.
- Fuck help!

445
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:38,379
I mean, fuck fair.
Fuck injustice.

446
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:40,999
Don't you ever just
want to stomp on someone...

447
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:43,406
...and bite off their ear,
just to do it?

448
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:45,742
Just to get it out of your system?

449
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:51,185
Well, I do remember something
I got mad at.

450
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,416
Something when I was in the brig
a marine did.

451
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,446
What happened? Grunts beat you up?

452
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,834
But that didn't get me mad.

453
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:04,680
Well, goddamn it,
what did get you mad?

454
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:09,424
This marine guard...

455
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:13,009
...he asked me if I believed
in Jesus Christ.

456
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:15,626
I said, "Yeah."

457
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:18,031
And he said that from now on...

458
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:21,678
...he was Jesus Christ,
and I shouldn't ever forget it.

459
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:23,505
What'd you do?

460
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:25,741
Did you hit him?

461
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,173
Can you imagine that?
That's awful!

462
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:30,800
Did you coldcock him?

463
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:34,959
He better hope the chaplain
don't catch him.

464
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,178
Most of the chaplains I know...

465
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,964
...want to stand up on the bridge
with the old man...

466
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:45,195
...and look through aviator sunglasses.

467
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:52,017
It takes a lot of dedication
to be a Navy chaplain.

468
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,250
Don't take diddlyshit, man!

469
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,211
Come on.

470
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,504
Come on. Come on!
Take a fucking poke at me!

471
00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:05,356
Take a poke at me. Come on.

472
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:07,244
- Come on.
- What for?

473
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,784
I'll punch you out...

474
00:35:08,978 --> 00:35:10,888
Punch me out, you little prick!

475
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,959
- He won't punch you. You know that.
- I'll make him!

476
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:16,141
Bad Ass, I like you.

477
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,224
Yeah, I like you.

478
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:24,070
I'm taking you to jail,
motherfucker.

479
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:27,562
That ain't your fault.

480
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:32,303
Come on, Mule!

481
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:33,708
Come on, goddamn it!

482
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:50,566
Bad Ass?

483
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:55,056
Would you teach me the hand signals?

484
00:35:57,777 --> 00:35:59,533
I don't give a shit!

485
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:14,954
One time...

486
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,411
...when I was down in Long Beach...

487
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,154
...this friend of mine
was looking for me...

488
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:25,036
...and I was up
on top of the car...

489
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,371
...and I pissed on his head.

490
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:30,384
Just being crazy, you know what I mean?

491
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:33,519
Don't you get crazy with me!

492
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:45,576
I think I'm going to be sick again.

493
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:56,141
How're we going to work this out?

494
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,216
Work what out?

495
00:36:58,577 --> 00:36:59,984
Who gets what bed!

496
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,783
What the fuck difference does it make?

497
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:10,833
Well, I can't take...

498
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:13,163
...this shit indefinitely, man.

499
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:18,895
What shit?

500
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:22,341
Somebody's got to make a decision.

501
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:33,706
There you go.

502
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:40,846
Just remember...

503
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:43,660
...rank has it privileges.

504
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:11,082
Wait a minute.

505
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:20,774
They make them shit here.

506
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:27,368
What?

507
00:38:45,393 --> 00:38:48,295
All we got to do is
get off the train at Philly...

508
00:38:48,496 --> 00:38:50,536
...and take a bus to Camden.

509
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:52,911
What's the matter with that?

510
00:38:53,904 --> 00:38:55,049
It's a couple hours.

511
00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:57,452
He didn't ask to see his mother.

512
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,245
He wouldn't ask...

513
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:01,929
...to go to the head if he had the runs.

514
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:08,716
I'm telling you,
he wants to see his mother.

515
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:12,586
How do we know she's home?

516
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,442
- It's Sunday!
- Sunday?

517
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,061
What's that supposed to mean?

518
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,140
Come on!

519
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:22,438
You want to go see your mother?

520
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:27,310
I don't want to get you guys
in trouble or nothing.

521
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:30,220
You've been so good
to me already.

522
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,968
Let's go and see your mother.

523
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:38,186
Don't worry about it, Mule.
Know what I mean?

524
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:59,823
That's Calvin Coolidge Junior High.

525
00:40:00,176 --> 00:40:01,355
I went there.

526
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,288
Where's your old man, Meadows?

527
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:07,688
Seattle.

528
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:09,449
Seattle, Washington.

529
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:13,226
I know where it is. What's he doing?

530
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,199
I think he works in a hardware store.

531
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,835
He's married.

532
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:21,354
Well, I mean not to my mother,
but to somebody else.

533
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:25,479
Maybe I even have a half sister.
I think I do.

534
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,116
Camden High!

535
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:30,665
I graduated from there.

536
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:35,365
Miss Marabito.

537
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:40,297
I wonder if she still teaches there.

538
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:44,366
She made me want to be a veterinarian.

539
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,940
You want to check next door or anything?

540
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:18,252
Your mom have any friends
in the neighborhood?

541
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:21,546
- Mrs. Esposito.
- Maybe she's over there.

542
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:23,950
Her car's gone.

543
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:27,880
What do you want to do?

544
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:31,434
You want to wait around a little?

545
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,645
We could wait around a little.

546
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:40,459
I'll go check with Mrs. Esposito.

547
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:53,766
- Legs really bother you, don't they?
- Sometimes.

548
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:56,938
You ought to take vitamins.

549
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:00,104
No, take vitamins. Seriously, man.

550
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:02,088
Go to the dispensary.

551
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:04,709
- What's wrong?
- We let him go by himself!

552
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:06,056
He could get away!

553
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:08,905
Don't get excited.
That kid ain't going nowhere.

554
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:10,477
What makes you so sure?

555
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:12,524
Well, you know him.

556
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:15,756
Jesus Christ!

557
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:18,504
Then where is he?

558
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:20,138
Where is he?

559
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:27,587
There.

560
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:32,747
Don't get your balls in an uproar.
Meadows ain't going nowhere without us.

561
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:37,550
Let me tell you something
about a kid like Meadows.

562
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,580
He's the kind of guy,
he's going to the brig...

563
00:42:40,783 --> 00:42:43,172
...and secretly he's probably glad.

564
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:48,203
On the outside, too many things
can happen to him, all of it bad.

565
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,952
This way, the worse part's
already happening.

566
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,613
He's probably glad.

567
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:55,555
Glad.

568
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:57,606
If you ain't right...

569
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:00,174
...you better be quick,
because I ain't.

570
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:01,955
She went for the day.

571
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:03,810
Sunday!

572
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:10,212
You want to go in and wait awhile?

573
00:43:10,414 --> 00:43:11,362
What for?

574
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,305
Well, she might come home early.

575
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:18,276
No, thanks.

576
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,988
Well, at least you could sit
in your own house.

577
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,499
Maybe we can get in.

578
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:50,541
I don't know what
I would've said to her anyway.

579
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:04,941
You know what Meadows ought to do?

580
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,058
He ought to get his old lady
to write her congressman.

581
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:14,219
She can write letters to her congressman
till she owns the fucking post office!

582
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:16,170
It don't mean diddlyshit!

583
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:18,951
Look, either we let him go
or he lives with it.

584
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,768
And we ain't about to let him go.
Understand?

585
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,770
Now look what you made him do.

586
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:48,268
- What I made him do?
- Yeah.

587
00:44:48,462 --> 00:44:51,015
- Where you going?
- To the head, okay?

588
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:56,487
If that don't make you just
want to shit in your flat hat, man.

589
00:44:56,686 --> 00:45:00,033
Look what you went... Look what you...
I hope you're satisfied!

590
00:45:00,237 --> 00:45:03,106
You're the one insisted
we take him to see his mother!

591
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:04,803
I hate this detail.

592
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:07,907
I hate this fucking
chicken-shit detail!

593
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:24,611
I love the fucking detail, I suppose.
What am I supposed to do?

594
00:45:24,814 --> 00:45:26,188
I'm just trying to...

595
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:35,820
Meadows?

596
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:40,966
Meadows, open up!

597
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,651
Meadows, you all right?

598
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:46,313
You all right?

599
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:54,630
I consider myself in jeopardy with you.
Understand?

600
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,105
In jeopardy.

601
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:59,555
This ain't no farewell party,
and he ain't retiring.

602
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,804
Understand?

603
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:03,525
He's a prisoner, and
we're taking him to jail.

604
00:46:03,724 --> 00:46:05,797
You have a tendency to forget that.

605
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:07,658
You're a menace, man!

606
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:10,636
You ain't no simple shit.
You're a motherfucking menace!

607
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:14,571
From now on, MAA can go
piss up a rope. You ain't no honcho!

608
00:46:14,765 --> 00:46:17,667
I don't want to hear more of
this psychology jive!

609
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:21,032
No more turning his head around
to prove what a big man you are!

610
00:46:21,229 --> 00:46:22,723
You're a lifer like me!

611
00:46:22,924 --> 00:46:24,812
Navy's the best thing
ever happened to me.

612
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:28,169
I don't want you to fuck me up.
You understand?

613
00:46:31,661 --> 00:46:33,733
- Buddusky?
- I hear you.

614
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:34,948
Do you agree?

615
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:38,920
I was just trying to show him
a good time. Know what I mean?

616
00:46:39,118 --> 00:46:42,020
He can't have a good time.
It ain't in him.

617
00:46:43,118 --> 00:46:46,052
- He had a good time in Washington.
- All right.

618
00:46:46,254 --> 00:46:48,163
He had a good time in Washington.

619
00:46:48,365 --> 00:46:51,235
Think that'll make it any
easier to pull his eight years?

620
00:46:51,437 --> 00:46:53,672
It won't. It'll make it harder.

621
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:01,668
So what.

622
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,833
You know what I mean?

623
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,077
Your attention, please.

624
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:18,375
Amtrak 211 for Chicago, boarding...

625
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:20,427
...in 10 minutes at gate three.

626
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:23,622
Amtrak 211 for Chicago...

627
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,475
...boarding at gate three.

628
00:47:25,836 --> 00:47:27,330
We go this way.

629
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,406
The train for Boston leaves
in two hours.

630
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,508
We don't leave the building until then.
Understand?

631
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:12,008
You got a quarter?

632
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:31,400
Where are you going?

633
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:35,809
Head.

634
00:48:37,805 --> 00:48:38,819
All right?

635
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:17,217
Sailor looks like he's lost something.

636
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,998
Probably have trouble finding it
with those 13 buttons.

637
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:26,147
If I was a Marine, I wouldn't
have to fuck with no 13 buttons.

638
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:28,874
I'd just take my hat off.

639
00:49:44,301 --> 00:49:45,162
Hi, boys.

640
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:49,513
- I call it karate!
- I call it motherfucker!

641
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:51,177
What's going on here?

642
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,376
Come on...

643
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:37,828
Wipe your nose, will you, kid?

644
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,701
He fought like a champ, though,
didn't he? Jesus.

645
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:43,239
Goddamn, that was great.

646
00:50:43,435 --> 00:50:44,994
It was great, wasn't it?

647
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:48,223
It was great. Admit it!
Give me a little of this!

648
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:51,775
Give me just because
they call me Shine in here.

649
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:54,791
I got your greatness.

650
00:50:55,979 --> 00:50:57,222
Meadows, over here...

651
00:50:57,738 --> 00:51:01,187
...they have the finest Italian sausage
sandwiches in the world...

652
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:02,664
...and I'm buying.

653
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:08,864
Goddamn...

654
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:10,887
I ask you, man.

655
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:15,077
Where else in the world can you get
a sandwich like this?

656
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:18,053
And for 50 cents!

657
00:51:19,787 --> 00:51:22,023
I never ate anything so good.

658
00:51:22,891 --> 00:51:24,265
I ain't shitting you.

659
00:51:24,522 --> 00:51:27,010
I'm going to have to have
another one of these.

660
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:31,017
I'd like a little more onions.

661
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:33,929
- Little more? There's some.
- How about some of these?

662
00:51:34,412 --> 00:51:35,525
You got it.

663
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,673
We got to figure out what to do.

664
00:51:45,515 --> 00:51:46,562
And we will.

665
00:51:46,762 --> 00:51:47,940
We will.

666
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,073
Only we're going to do it
over a bottle of Heineken's.

667
00:51:51,914 --> 00:51:53,288
What's Heineken's?

668
00:51:53,802 --> 00:51:56,007
The finest beer in the world, kid.

669
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:58,439
President Kennedy used to drink it.

670
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:05,154
Goddamned Dutch soup is about all...

671
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,006
Double up, there.

672
00:52:08,202 --> 00:52:10,756
Want to get in this
or do you want to keep quiet?

673
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:12,645
All right, how'd you do?

674
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:21,509
Help me get Buddusky out.
He's betting with our travel money.

675
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,928
Hope this won't go in the toilet.

676
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:27,713
He's losing too.

677
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:30,721
All right, gentlemen.

678
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:33,160
It's you and me, one on one.

679
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:34,282
Easy money, eh?

680
00:52:34,475 --> 00:52:36,744
What do you think?
Here's to you.

681
00:52:36,939 --> 00:52:37,767
Cheers.

682
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:39,238
You want the honors?

683
00:52:39,434 --> 00:52:40,481
You go ahead.

684
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:43,583
Don't worry about a thing.

685
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:47,358
I'm hustling this guy, understand?
I got him right where I want him.

686
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:49,253
Maybe he's hustling you.

687
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:55,144
Maybe he is, but this isn't the time
to argue about it...

688
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,655
...because if I don't win,
we don't leave New York.

689
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:00,287
Fourteen years.

690
00:53:01,547 --> 00:53:03,685
Fourteen motherfucking years.

691
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:08,071
This'll make him go crazy.

692
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:15,016
The man is going to hustle me,
with glasses.

693
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,464
Fifty-four...

694
00:53:19,082 --> 00:53:20,326
...sixty-one...

695
00:53:20,521 --> 00:53:23,489
...sixty-three dollars.
That's $21...

696
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:24,639
...apiece.

697
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,147
Apiece?

698
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:28,298
Sure, we're partners, ain't we?

699
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:29,768
Yeah, Bad Ass.

700
00:53:29,963 --> 00:53:34,470
Then take your fucking 21 bucks and
don't give me such a hard time.

701
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,936
For you, back here.
Right here.

702
00:53:38,505 --> 00:53:40,774
Bravo, Yankee. Bravo, Yankee.

703
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,050
You're damn right.

704
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,546
"Dead man," in Russian.

705
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,570
That was damn good, kid.

706
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,875
You ought to put in for signalman.

707
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:09,252
What's that?

708
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:13,001
I don't know. I hear it too.

709
00:54:14,058 --> 00:54:16,033
What the hell is an "Indiana dog"?

710
00:54:18,346 --> 00:54:21,794
Goddamn, that's the goddamnedest thing
I ever heard!

711
00:54:26,091 --> 00:54:29,156
- What is that?
- Hey, let's go take a look.

712
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,279
I mean, what the hell?
Eight years and a D.D.

713
00:54:53,354 --> 00:54:54,728
What are we going to do?

714
00:54:56,714 --> 00:54:58,307
Take off your shoes.

715
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:06,822
Must be one of them Jap joints
where we got to take off our shoes.

716
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:39,807
What are they saying?

717
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:43,045
Hold it down.

718
00:55:43,976 --> 00:55:46,049
I think we're in a church.

719
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:53,478
Good evening.

720
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:54,785
Good evening!

721
00:55:55,113 --> 00:55:57,382
Welcome to Nichiren Shoshu meeting.

722
00:55:57,577 --> 00:56:01,189
Tonight throughout the city there
are hundreds of meetings like this.

723
00:56:01,386 --> 00:56:04,681
Where people learn about
Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and Gohonzon.

724
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:06,854
What's a Gohonzon?

725
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:09,671
I'll tell you about it later.

726
00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:13,504
We're going to do that
through the experiences we've had.

727
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:16,161
Who's had an experience?

728
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:20,350
Good evening!

729
00:56:20,553 --> 00:56:22,593
When I first started chanting...

730
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:25,859
...I wanted to find a girl
that I could relate to...

731
00:56:28,137 --> 00:56:30,023
She took me to a meeting like this.

732
00:56:30,216 --> 00:56:33,282
I remember thinking,
"These people are out of their minds!"

733
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,538
But later we went to her apartment,
and I tried her Gohonzon.

734
00:56:37,735 --> 00:56:39,678
Come on, what's a Gohonzon?

735
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,637
I'll tell you later.

736
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:45,511
And now I really love the clarinet...

737
00:56:45,705 --> 00:56:48,868
...and I can't remember why
I wanted a flute in the first place.

738
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:56,384
There's a sun
shining in your heart

739
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:59,297
There's a song
waiting to be sung

740
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,306
There's a dream
longing to be free

741
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:04,901
In your life
happiness you'll see

742
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,711
Bring it out
Your shining light

743
00:57:08,264 --> 00:57:11,199
You can change this world
of trouble and strife

744
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:16,648
Why does all of this
make me feel so fucking bad?

745
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:21,571
Bring it out now
Bring it out now

746
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,973
Bring it out now,
hey!

747
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:28,962
A bunch of candy-asses.

748
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:32,511
Ever hear such happy horseshit?

749
00:57:32,776 --> 00:57:35,591
That one guy was a big homo, huh?

750
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,455
Yeah, but you guys,
he sure was a happy homo.

751
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:54,279
If you're going to chant, let's figure
out what you're going to chant for.

752
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:57,728
How about I get sprung from Portsmouth?

753
00:58:04,169 --> 00:58:05,859
Let's see if it works.

754
00:58:06,728 --> 00:58:09,314
Then you can chant
for something really big.

755
00:58:10,152 --> 00:58:14,081
Yeah, like how's about
the three of us get laid, huh?

756
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:16,773
Should you chant
for something like that?

757
00:58:16,968 --> 00:58:18,179
Why the fuck not?

758
00:58:18,376 --> 00:58:19,805
Well, it's a religion!

759
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,974
You're too good to believe!

760
00:58:31,687 --> 00:58:33,759
"Yodeling in the canyon."

761
00:58:34,664 --> 00:58:36,071
Ever heard of it?

762
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,997
You ever done that before?

763
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,102
Not exactly, no.

764
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Are they really doing that
when they take that picture?

765
00:58:59,751 --> 00:59:03,842
Well, kid, there's more things in this
life than you can possibly imagine.

766
00:59:04,903 --> 00:59:07,270
I knew a whore once in Wilmington.

767
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:09,189
She had a...

768
00:59:09,448 --> 00:59:10,659
...glass eye.

769
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:17,122
She used to take it out
and wink people off for a dollar.

770
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:18,918
Really?

771
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,638
There's still some room for your rank.
You want it?

772
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:44,291
No, I don't think so.

773
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:47,684
Yeah, come on, kid.
It's time you made your rate.

774
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:50,658
They busted me to E-1.
You know that.

775
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:54,114
Listen, right now
we're a navy of three.

776
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,782
Pick a rate. Any rate.

777
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:59,107
I can make you anything I want to
because I'm the honcho.

778
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,770
What'll it be?

779
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:13,445
Chief Signalman?

780
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:20,068
Okay, partner.

781
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:24,287
L. Meadows, S.M.C.

782
01:00:31,111 --> 01:00:33,380
Show me some moves, kid!

783
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,222
Look, he don't know what to do.

784
01:00:36,423 --> 01:00:37,798
He don't know!

785
01:00:40,328 --> 01:00:43,644
He looks like a
goddamn big penguin, don't he?

786
01:00:44,615 --> 01:00:46,754
Watch out for children!

787
01:00:46,983 --> 01:00:49,471
- Hey, look...
- Cruise right through them!

788
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:51,558
Give them the spinner, kid!

789
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:58,078
He sure is having a good time.

790
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,767
Sure is. And you said
it wasn't in him.

791
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:03,996
All right.

792
01:01:05,735 --> 01:01:07,775
Watch out for the Indian, kid!

793
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,069
Don't crush somebody.

794
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:15,875
Look at the size of this guy
on roller skates.

795
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:26,879
I was wondering if we're done.

796
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,246
It worked!

797
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,492
I chanted to stay on my feet and I did.
It worked.

798
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:12,838
Lighten up, will you, Meadows? Jesus!

799
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,168
You're chanting!

800
01:02:39,846 --> 01:02:42,977
I'm a member of Nichiren Shoshu.
My name's Donna.

801
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:44,988
How do you do?

802
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,052
Hello.

803
01:02:47,686 --> 01:02:49,442
What are you chanting for?

804
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:55,359
Go ahead, Meadows.
Tell her what you're chanting for.

805
01:02:56,165 --> 01:02:56,994
A girl?

806
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,760
That's okay.
You can chant for anything.

807
01:03:03,463 --> 01:03:05,732
- What's your name?
- Meadows.

808
01:03:05,927 --> 01:03:08,294
- Your first name.
- Larry.

809
01:03:12,103 --> 01:03:14,436
Why don't you come over
and meet some people?

810
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,124
Just for a minute.

811
01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:19,195
Come on. We'll be right back.

812
01:03:27,078 --> 01:03:31,104
If this guy gets pussy out of this,
I'm gonna eat my fucking flat hat.

813
01:03:31,302 --> 01:03:32,960
I'm going
to start chanting too.

814
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:47,679
Hey, you guys? Drop your socks and grab
your cocks. We're going to a party.

815
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:52,795
This could be the big one,
eh, Meadows?

816
01:03:53,286 --> 01:03:54,496
You just moved in?

817
01:03:54,694 --> 01:03:58,720
Not too long ago. I think I
might move out again too.

818
01:04:00,998 --> 01:04:04,031
- It's a problem, finding a place.
- This is a nice party.

819
01:04:04,934 --> 01:04:07,421
Might as well be at a fucking bus stop.

820
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:10,180
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

821
01:04:10,373 --> 01:04:13,537
Hey, I'm telling you, Mule,
we got it made.

822
01:04:13,733 --> 01:04:16,416
All we got to do is get rid of
that creep there...

823
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:18,914
...and we got these three chicks
to ourselves.

824
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:20,484
We have, huh?

825
01:04:20,741 --> 01:04:23,108
Yeah. Why not?

826
01:04:23,397 --> 01:04:27,937
Because those three chicks would rather
fuck each other than us, that's why not.

827
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:30,654
There's nothing...

828
01:04:31,846 --> 01:04:33,821
...like being on the sea...

829
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:37,213
...even in the Navy.

830
01:04:38,885 --> 01:04:40,892
Being on the bridge...

831
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,709
...doing a man's job...

832
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:45,186
That's great.

833
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,559
Where you going?

834
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:51,577
I'm not putting down the government.
I just want him to tell me one thing.

835
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:54,465
There must be one thing
you don't like about Nixon.

836
01:04:56,261 --> 01:04:58,564
You sure have a lot of records.

837
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:04,442
I get most of them free.
I work in the business.

838
01:05:05,158 --> 01:05:06,652
What business?

839
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:14,562
- I smoked grass.
- Huh?

840
01:05:14,756 --> 01:05:16,545
I smoked grass, Bad Ass.

841
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,334
I'm giving this girl such a line
of horseshit. It is unbelievable!

842
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:26,021
She loves it. She loves it!

843
01:05:27,365 --> 01:05:29,274
Doing a man's job...

844
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:34,210
...talking to ships...

845
01:05:41,669 --> 01:05:44,157
...across miles and miles...

846
01:05:45,637 --> 01:05:47,262
...of liquid real estate.

847
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:55,260
Ooh, big time.

848
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:58,399
How come you don't
see more black officers?

849
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,778
Because you need a recommendation
from a white man, usually.

850
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:09,598
- How can you stay...
- Nothing Nixon says disturbs you?

851
01:06:09,796 --> 01:06:11,356
Just tell me, is that right?

852
01:06:11,556 --> 01:06:13,311
Henry, you're driving me crazy.

853
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:15,614
You guys on leave, or what?

854
01:06:15,908 --> 01:06:17,250
"Liberty," you mean.

855
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:18,655
Liberty.

856
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:22,813
No.

857
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:31,966
Well, what are you guys doing anyway?

858
01:06:33,093 --> 01:06:34,947
They're taking me to jail.

859
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:44,515
I've seen things.
Seen men do things that...

860
01:06:46,372 --> 01:06:50,563
...I wouldn't even begin to tell you
at a time like this, my fair darling.

861
01:06:51,012 --> 01:06:53,347
- I can see what it's done for you.
- Can you?

862
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:55,137
That's wonderful.

863
01:06:55,334 --> 01:06:56,763
Must be the uniform.

864
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:03,490
- They are cute, aren't they?
- Oh, yeah.

865
01:07:04,548 --> 01:07:07,133
I like the way...
You know what I like about it?

866
01:07:07,652 --> 01:07:10,107
One of my favorite things
about this uniform...

867
01:07:10,307 --> 01:07:12,609
...is the way
it makes your dick look.

868
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:16,319
How did you feel about
going to Vietnam?

869
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:26,009
The man says, "Go."
I got to do what the man says.

870
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,049
We're living in this man's world,
ain't we?

871
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:33,284
Oh, wow!

872
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:36,927
Eight years.

873
01:07:39,332 --> 01:07:40,347
I get two off.

874
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,038
So it's only six.

875
01:07:45,636 --> 01:07:47,131
Why don't you get away?

876
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:53,212
Get away?

877
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:55,395
To Canada.

878
01:07:57,764 --> 01:08:01,211
I've got this friend, George Lucido!

879
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:06,456
He Shakabukued me!
He's a group chief in Toronto.

880
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:08,705
I'll give you his number.

881
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:14,397
I couldn't.

882
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:15,774
Why not?

883
01:08:17,028 --> 01:08:18,589
It would be their ass.

884
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:22,362
What do you owe them?

885
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,951
They're my best friends, Donna.

886
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:28,800
Come on.

887
01:08:29,764 --> 01:08:32,153
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

888
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:48,835
You know what I mean?

889
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:15,745
What?

890
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,561
It's up to you...

891
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:29,727
...but I'm going to chant for you.

892
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:34,013
I'm going to chant for you
with my whole heart.

893
01:09:45,892 --> 01:09:47,233
Chant?

894
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:49,793
Yes...

895
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:53,433
...that you get away.

896
01:10:12,996 --> 01:10:14,173
Bad Ass?

897
01:10:16,132 --> 01:10:18,881
What the fuck is it now, Meadows?

898
01:10:21,796 --> 01:10:26,268
If you're Catholic, do you think
it's sacrilegious to chant?

899
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:28,888
- Did it get you laid?
- No.

900
01:10:29,507 --> 01:10:33,401
Then, Meadows, what the fuck do you
want to go on chanting for?

901
01:10:34,946 --> 01:10:38,175
Chant your ass off, kid.
But any pussy you get in this world...

902
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,924
...you have to pay for,
one way or another.

903
01:10:41,123 --> 01:10:42,432
Hallelujah!

904
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:56,698
When do we get to Boston?

905
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:58,908
Two hours.

906
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:02,200
What time we got to be in Portsmouth?

907
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:05,309
Not after 1800 tomorrow.

908
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,249
Well, what do you think?

909
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,936
- I think we ought to get the kid laid.
- Laid?

910
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:19,137
Ever heard of it?

911
01:11:21,826 --> 01:11:23,998
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir?

912
01:11:24,195 --> 01:11:26,300
I asked for my eggs over easy.

913
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:27,743
They are over easy, sir.

914
01:11:27,938 --> 01:11:29,215
No, they're not.

915
01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:41,756
I'm learning. I'm learning.

916
01:11:44,483 --> 01:11:46,141
Oh, Jesus!

917
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:51,231
You're taking the kid
to the cathouse, ain't you?

918
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:54,784
Yeah. Come on, Mule.

919
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,173
He's 18 years old.
He ain't never been fucked.

920
01:11:58,465 --> 01:12:01,914
Next chance he gets,
he's going to be 26.

921
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:08,477
He might not want any by then.

922
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,048
You mean right now?
Just go ahead and do it?

923
01:12:13,251 --> 01:12:15,738
No. Not this exact minute.

924
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:18,561
Later on tonight.

925
01:12:22,914 --> 01:12:24,670
I think I would.

926
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:29,600
- Yeah, get the old ashes hauled.
- "Ashes hauled"?

927
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:37,151
- What are we doing?
- Huh?

928
01:12:37,347 --> 01:12:40,992
- What are we doing?
- Looking for a certain guy.

929
01:12:48,419 --> 01:12:50,720
Here, here, here.
This one right here.

930
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:57,623
How're they treating you, partner?

931
01:12:57,825 --> 01:12:59,352
Fine, sailor. Where to?

932
01:13:00,546 --> 01:13:02,334
Just down the road.

933
01:13:05,282 --> 01:13:07,354
Let me tell you
what we really want.

934
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:10,172
You look honest.
I think I can trust you.

935
01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:19,458
We're in transit,
the three of us, see, and...

936
01:13:20,034 --> 01:13:22,882
We could use
the services of a decent whorehouse.

937
01:13:23,074 --> 01:13:24,002
Know what I mean?

938
01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:26,487
One that don't hate Gls.

939
01:13:35,715 --> 01:13:37,755
Sizable tip in it for you.

940
01:13:38,402 --> 01:13:40,857
Save the tip. I get it
at the other end.

941
01:13:42,242 --> 01:13:43,518
Hey, thanks a lot.

942
01:13:43,842 --> 01:13:45,752
I've been in transit a few times too.

943
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,025
I'm an old minesweep sailor myself.

944
01:13:48,225 --> 01:13:51,640
Oh, yeah? You're a swabbie?
I thought you was. I did.

945
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,807
I thought he was a swabbie.
Minesweep, eh?

946
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:37,856
Hi, boys.

947
01:14:38,082 --> 01:14:39,162
I'm Millie.

948
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:42,174
- Hi, Millie.
- Come on in.

949
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:45,118
- Thank you.
- The Navy's always welcome here.

950
01:14:57,984 --> 01:15:00,887
Too late for Captain Kangaroo, ladies?

951
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:05,335
Here, let me tell you how it is, Mil.

952
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:09,792
We got a friend we'd like to do
a favor for. He's going on a trip.

953
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:12,189
- Just him?
- Just him, yeah.

954
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:14,524
What kind of party you after?

955
01:15:15,298 --> 01:15:17,054
Well, it's his party.

956
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:19,998
You name it, sailor.

957
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:23,223
Okay, sailor.
Take your pick.

958
01:15:24,801 --> 01:15:26,078
Pick a winner, kid.

959
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:19,095
Make it a good one, honey.
It's got to last a long time.

960
01:16:19,296 --> 01:16:21,336
Sure, honey. Anything you say.

961
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:22,911
You know what I mean?

962
01:16:26,945 --> 01:16:28,952
Kid, you picked a real winner.

963
01:16:34,433 --> 01:16:36,800
You boys just make
yourselves comfortable.

964
01:16:38,722 --> 01:16:42,016
Goddamn! He picked the same one
I would have.

965
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,182
She's a cute little thing, isn't she?

966
01:16:47,072 --> 01:16:48,926
Your coat, honey.

967
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:59,512
Come over here by the sink.
Let me check you out.

968
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:13,626
You're not going to have
a bit of trouble.

969
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:37,627
Jesus Christ!

970
01:17:40,607 --> 01:17:42,746
Well, that's what I call "quick."

971
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,822
Look, those are the rules. Doesn't
matter if it's 10 hours or 10 seconds.

972
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:52,344
Okay, tootsie. We'll stake him
to another shot.

973
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,418
I'm sorry.

974
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:03,734
You want to try it again, kid?

975
01:18:05,312 --> 01:18:06,359
Yeah.

976
01:18:08,352 --> 01:18:09,432
Okay, honey.

977
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:12,730
Don't worry, kid.
Plenty more where that came from.

978
01:18:21,344 --> 01:18:22,718
You got all night, kid.

979
01:18:30,529 --> 01:18:32,122
You ever been married?

980
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:35,255
Not so you'd notice.

981
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:41,815
Once.

982
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:44,823
A little girl in Torrance.

983
01:18:45,151 --> 01:18:46,677
Know where that is?

984
01:18:48,543 --> 01:18:52,318
It's near San Pedro, on the way
to Terminal Island, you know?

985
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,606
Dottie Brown.

986
01:18:58,335 --> 01:19:02,077
She had great tits and wore
angora sweaters all the time.

987
01:19:02,495 --> 01:19:07,100
She wanted me to go to trade school
and become a TV repairman.

988
01:19:08,928 --> 01:19:11,033
Drive around all that smog and shit...

989
01:19:11,231 --> 01:19:14,843
...fixing TVs out of the back
of a VW bus.

990
01:19:18,016 --> 01:19:19,740
I just couldn't do it.

991
01:19:25,696 --> 01:19:26,940
You ever been married?

992
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,458
I still support my mama.

993
01:19:33,246 --> 01:19:35,734
She can't brag enough about me.

994
01:19:35,934 --> 01:19:39,578
Tells everybody all the places I go,
how many men are under me...

995
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:41,367
...all that shit.

996
01:19:45,343 --> 01:19:46,456
Yeah, man...

997
01:19:47,712 --> 01:19:50,559
...I don't know what I would've done
without the Navy.

998
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,241
I guess we're just a couple of lifers.

999
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:08,662
How was...

1000
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,293
How was what, honey?

1001
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:23,034
Well, you got off to a shaky start.

1002
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,354
After that, you took to it
like a duck to water.

1003
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:44,382
I don't know if I have
enough money to go again...

1004
01:20:46,623 --> 01:20:48,826
...but I'll pay you what I have...

1005
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:52,028
...just to look at you.

1006
01:20:53,663 --> 01:20:54,939
Just to what?

1007
01:21:00,383 --> 01:21:01,944
Look at you.

1008
01:21:06,335 --> 01:21:09,880
Guess you haven't seen many girls
with their clothes off, have you?

1009
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:18,204
Well, let me tell you.
I've got a good body.

1010
01:21:20,351 --> 01:21:22,490
Not great, but pretty good.

1011
01:21:47,327 --> 01:21:48,788
It's beautiful.

1012
01:21:59,838 --> 01:22:01,398
What did she say again?

1013
01:22:01,598 --> 01:22:03,605
"Let me check you out, honey."

1014
01:22:03,805 --> 01:22:05,594
I swear to God.

1015
01:22:05,789 --> 01:22:09,564
Like I was in a gas station
and she was checking the oil.

1016
01:22:10,173 --> 01:22:12,279
- And then...
- Then we know what happened.

1017
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:15,381
Yeah, but after. After...

1018
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:21,652
Well, maybe it was an act for her.

1019
01:22:22,559 --> 01:22:24,826
I mean, I know she was a whore...

1020
01:22:25,085 --> 01:22:26,940
...but I think she liked me.

1021
01:22:27,869 --> 01:22:31,895
They got feelings just like
everybody else, kid. She probably did.

1022
01:22:33,021 --> 01:22:35,028
Well, it was real for me.

1023
01:22:35,261 --> 01:22:36,668
That's what counts.

1024
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:52,956
Welcome to the wonderful world
of pussy, kid. The sink's yours.

1025
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:06,292
We don't have to be there till 1800.

1026
01:23:07,006 --> 01:23:09,941
It takes an hour and a half
to get to Portsmouth.

1027
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:12,922
We could go see a movie or two.

1028
01:23:13,502 --> 01:23:16,088
We can get us a couple of six-packs.

1029
01:23:16,766 --> 01:23:20,246
Shit, we can even go back
to the cathouse if you want to.

1030
01:23:24,317 --> 01:23:25,462
No.

1031
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:28,986
I already did everything one time.

1032
01:23:30,012 --> 01:23:33,625
That makes that one time stick out.
You know what I mean?

1033
01:23:41,373 --> 01:23:44,155
- It sure is a shit day.
- Ain't it the truth.

1034
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:45,877
Yeah, it is.

1035
01:23:46,558 --> 01:23:49,721
If it was summer, we could maybe
have a picnic.

1036
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:58,652
Son of a bitch!

1037
01:24:02,909 --> 01:24:03,857
Thank you.

1038
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:14,328
This wood's too fucking green, man.
It ain't going to burn.

1039
01:24:14,878 --> 01:24:15,826
Wet wood.

1040
01:24:20,445 --> 01:24:21,939
Wait a minute!

1041
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,277
- What are you looking for?
- Buns.

1042
01:24:48,829 --> 01:24:50,323
I forgot them.

1043
01:24:50,621 --> 01:24:52,858
- You forgot the buns?
- Yeah.

1044
01:24:53,053 --> 01:24:54,809
How can you eat a hot dog
without a bun?

1045
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:58,811
- It's not a hot dog without...
- Don't eat the fucking thing, then!

1046
01:24:59,421 --> 01:25:00,534
Shit!

1047
01:25:05,053 --> 01:25:06,646
It ain't bad.

1048
01:25:15,709 --> 01:25:16,919
Shit!

1049
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:24,180
- I don't want no fucking hot dogs.
- He don't eat them without buns.

1050
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:49,051
It's kind of like being at sea.

1051
01:25:52,221 --> 01:25:54,642
I was on a weather ship once...

1052
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:56,696
...off of Greenland.

1053
01:25:58,076 --> 01:26:00,018
Right in the middle of winter.

1054
01:26:00,476 --> 01:26:01,786
How was it?

1055
01:26:03,133 --> 01:26:05,173
I like being at sea.

1056
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:17,140
Kid's come a long way
in the last few days, ain't he?

1057
01:26:43,388 --> 01:26:45,363
Let's get this over with.

1058
01:27:15,835 --> 01:27:18,869
He don't stand a chance
in Portsmouth, you know.

1059
01:27:19,675 --> 01:27:21,562
You know that, don't you?

1060
01:27:23,131 --> 01:27:27,027
Goddamn grunts kicking the shit
out of him for eight years.

1061
01:27:31,324 --> 01:27:33,396
He don't stand a chance.

1062
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,956
I don't want to hear about it.

1063
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,289
"Maggot" this. "Maggot" that.

1064
01:27:43,836 --> 01:27:46,618
Marines are really assholes,
you know that?

1065
01:27:49,244 --> 01:27:53,172
It takes a certain kind of a sadistic
temperament to be a Marine.

1066
01:29:09,115 --> 01:29:10,773
What the fuck's he doing?

1067
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:14,292
Hey, Meadows!

1068
01:29:23,612 --> 01:29:24,953
What's he doing?

1069
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,664
"Bravo...

1070
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,329
...Yankee...

1071
01:29:30,556 --> 01:29:33,273
...Bravo, Yankee.
Bye-bye. End of the word."

1072
01:29:33,467 --> 01:29:36,184
Hey, this son of a bitch
is running away!

1073
01:29:36,731 --> 01:29:38,257
Halt, you son of a bitch!

1074
01:29:49,947 --> 01:29:52,664
Halt! You motherfucker!

1075
01:29:53,147 --> 01:29:54,259
Buddusky, don't!

1076
01:29:54,459 --> 01:29:55,255
Don't!

1077
01:29:59,259 --> 01:30:01,147
Goddamn, I lost my fucking shoe!

1078
01:30:18,906 --> 01:30:20,216
Let me go!

1079
01:30:21,307 --> 01:30:22,583
Buddusky, don't!

1080
01:30:22,779 --> 01:30:24,983
Let me go, you bastard!

1081
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:44,722
Please let me go!

1082
01:31:00,315 --> 01:31:02,387
I lost my fucking shoe!

1083
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:53,199
Baker, Mooney, prisoner from Norfolk,
on the double!

1084
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:37,911
Where'd you get the idea
that wearing an armband...

1085
01:33:38,105 --> 01:33:40,658
...and a sidearm entitles you
to abuse a prisoner?

1086
01:33:42,681 --> 01:33:44,503
They teach you that in the Navy?

1087
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:47,442
Or was that your idea of a good time?

1088
01:33:48,891 --> 01:33:49,719
I guess.

1089
01:33:49,914 --> 01:33:52,052
You guess what, sailor?

1090
01:33:55,226 --> 01:33:57,494
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1091
01:33:58,552 --> 01:34:00,211
Nothing, sir.

1092
01:34:02,073 --> 01:34:05,651
- Did the prisoner offer any resistance?
- No, sir.

1093
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:09,645
Did he try to escape?

1094
01:34:13,049 --> 01:34:14,510
Not exactly.

1095
01:34:17,273 --> 01:34:20,982
That's a little vague.
Either he did or didn't. Which is it?

1096
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:27,312
Don't look at him
for the answer. Which is it?

1097
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:31,992
- He didn't.
- He didn't what?

1098
01:34:33,689 --> 01:34:35,729
He didn't try to escape.

1099
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:41,464
He didn't try to escape, "sir."

1100
01:34:44,089 --> 01:34:46,642
He didn't try to escape, sir.

1101
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,341
You haven't left yet.

1102
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,072
Sir?

1103
01:35:01,592 --> 01:35:05,368
Your orders weren't endorsed. According
to this, you're still in Norfolk.

1104
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,087
Well, we're standing here.

1105
01:35:07,288 --> 01:35:08,402
It's not our fault.

1106
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:09,714
You haven't left yet.

1107
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:12,401
- You haven't left!
- That's not our fault!

1108
01:35:12,889 --> 01:35:15,889
Look, sir. We both got
a lot of time in.

1109
01:35:16,249 --> 01:35:17,678
What's that supposed to mean?

1110
01:35:18,201 --> 01:35:21,365
Too much time to be hard-ass
because some dude in Norfolk...

1111
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,600
...forgot to endorse our orders.

1112
01:35:26,328 --> 01:35:27,855
You're asking for trouble.

1113
01:35:28,248 --> 01:35:30,004
I'm asking to see the XO.

1114
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:32,403
Deep trouble!

1115
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,614
No.

1116
01:35:36,056 --> 01:35:39,156
We ain't about to say
anything else until we see the XO.

1117
01:36:03,896 --> 01:36:05,357
Get the hell out of here.

1118
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,632
You're supposed to pull a few copies.

1119
01:36:29,592 --> 01:36:31,447
Goddamn grunts!

1120
01:36:31,864 --> 01:36:33,871
Think they can get away with anything!

1121
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:37,078
Telling me how to do my job.
I know my job.

1122
01:36:37,273 --> 01:36:41,266
I know my goddamn job better than
anybody else in the goddamn Navy!

1123
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:45,174
We really told him though, didn't we?

1124
01:36:45,369 --> 01:36:47,125
Trying to ream our ass...

1125
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:50,581
...and he don't even have sense
to pull a few goddamn copies!

1126
01:36:50,775 --> 01:36:52,848

I hate this motherfucking,
chicken shit detail.

1128
01:37:01,688 --> 01:37:03,183
Where are you going?

1129
01:37:03,576 --> 01:37:05,649
- Norfolk.
- I mean now.

1130
01:37:06,936 --> 01:37:10,417
I don't know. Stop off
in Baltimore maybe. You?

1131
01:37:11,448 --> 01:37:13,521
Back to New York, I guess.

1132
01:37:15,352 --> 01:37:16,726
See you in Norfolk.

1133
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:20,629
Yeah. Maybe our fucking orders
have come through.
