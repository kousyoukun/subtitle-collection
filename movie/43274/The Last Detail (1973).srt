1
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,120
Buddusky!

2
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,120
Either of you guys seen Buddusky?

3
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,000
Buddusky!

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,320
What?

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,240
MAA sent me.

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,400
He wants to see you right away.

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040
Tell MAA to go fuck himself.

8
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,400
Well, he said, "Right away."

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,680
Come on, Buddusky.

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,960
It's your ass if you don't.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,840
Look, maybe your orders came through.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
Come on, Buddusky!

13
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,880
It's your ass.

14
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,960
Bullshit.

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
My ass!

16
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,680
Mulhall!

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,040
Master-at-arms wants
to see you right away.

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,080
I ain't going on no shit detail.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,120
Come on! It's my ass if you don't.

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,320
I ain't going on no shit detail!

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
It's your ass too. Come on, Mule.

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,840
Maybe your orders came through.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,040
Tell the MAA you couldn't find me.

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,040
He knows where you are.

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,160
When you're in the Navy
and in transit...

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
...nobody knows where you are!

27
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Go tell the MAA to fuck himself.

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,560
I ain't going on no shit detail!

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,080
Morning.

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,960
You are one lucky son of a bitch...

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
...Bad Ass!

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,920
You are one lucky son of a bitch!

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
Where am I going, Chief?

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
How come you're so lucky, Buddusky?

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,320
You're another lucky son of a bitch.

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,600
You dudes pulled
temporary duty as chasers.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,920
Where to?

38
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Portsmouth Naval Prison.

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,280
- Who we taking?
- Seaman.

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,000
Used to be.

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Meadows, Lawrence M.
Drew eight years and a D. D.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,120
Jesus, what the hell did he do?
Kill the old man?

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,040
Come on inside.

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,360
Sweek!
Get these old boys some coffee.

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,760
All right, Chief.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Who'd he kill, Chief?

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,920
Didn't kill nobody. Robbery.

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
How much did he lift?

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,120
Forty dollars.

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,640
Forty dollars!

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,080
Forty dollars.

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,440
You're shitting me!

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,720
I wouldn't shit you.

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
You're my favorite turd.

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Jesus!

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,920
Eight years and a D. D. for $40.

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,440
I thought they only pulled that
shit in the Army!

58
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
You see, he tried...

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,160
...to lift the polio contribution box.

60
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
Polio box is the old man's old lady's...

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,840
...favorite do-gooder project.

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,800
She's responsible for all the polio
contributions on the base, you know?

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Every year, they give her a plaque.

64
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
Along comes Meadows
and fucks over charity.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,240
She took it very seriously.

66
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
- Jesus!
- Eight years.

67
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,920
That's very seriously.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,360
You know what I mean?

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Good duty for you guys.
Get to go to Washington...

70
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
...New York...

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
...Boston.

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,160
I'd trade places with you.

73
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,200
Listen...

74
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,120
...we could get this guy
to Portsmouth in two days.

75
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Less.

76
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,840
They're going to give us a week.
You know what I mean?

77
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,960
So what?

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,120
We get there in two days, they won't
give us no week to get back.

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,400
Bullshit!

80
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,840
Besides...

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,560
...they got to give us
all that per diem, regardless.

82
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,640
That's money for you,
for me and for him.

83
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,840
We run this little shitbird's ass
all the way to the brig...

84
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,680
...save his per diem and ours,
split it and spend it on the way home.

85
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,280
You know what I mean?

86
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,600
Well, let's shag ass!

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,520
You're goddamn right!

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,800
Okay, Buddusky!
You're the honcho.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Carryall and driver are outside
to take you to the bus.

90
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,880
Here's the keys to the cuffs.

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,040
Each of you gets one key.

92
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,640
I want you both to sign
these chits for the pieces.

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,600
Here's one clip each.

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,680
Now, off the record...

95
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
...the old man has a
personal interest in this.

96
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
If you fuck up, you know what.

97
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,600
Are you all set, Cochise?

98
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,240
All right, shitbird. On your feet.

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,920
They're taking you to Portsmouth.
This is Petty Officer Buddusky.

100
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,960
This is Petty Officer Mulhall.

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,720
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,160
You know why they're chasers?

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,280
"Chasers," sir?

104
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,120
Do you know why they are
taking you to the brig?

105
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
No, sir.

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,480
They're bastards when they want to be,
and they always want to be.

107
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,040
Take my word for it, they aren't
about to take any shit from you.

108
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,840
If they do, they'll get reamed out,
and they know it.

109
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,120
- What?!
- Yes, sir!

110
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
All right, he's all yours.

111
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,600
It's colder than witch boob,
ain't it?

112
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Coffee?

113
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
Let's make it.

114
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,320
Do you have to go to the head?

115
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,480
No, sir.

116
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,720
Be sure now, Meadows, because
from now on, whenever you go...

117
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,400
...one of us is going
to have to go with you.

118
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm not going to kill myself.

119
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
Well, I don't think so...

120
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
...but you know how it is.

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,040
Yes, sir.
I don't need to use the head anyway.

122
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,040
Let's go.

123
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,160
Kill himself, huh?

124
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,520
Back of the bus.

125
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Meadows.

126
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,680
Yes, sir?

127
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,720
I'm removing your handcuffs, Meadows.

128
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Navy feels that on
certain kinds of vehicular transport...

129
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,360
...the prisoner shall have
the use of both his hands...

130
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,520
...to protect his self
in case of an accident.

131
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,040
- Ain't that right, Mulhane?
- That's right.

132
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Where'd you get that candy bar?

133
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
I had it with me.

134
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
Okay, sailor.

135
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,280
I wasn't accusing you of nothing.

136
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
I had them with me!

137
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,960
Hey, man! I ain't said a word.

138
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,520
Take it easy.

139
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,080
You're making Mulhouse hungry.

140
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,320
Meadows?

141
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,560
- You want anything?
- No, sir.

142
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,240
Here, let me have that.

143
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,480
No, wait.

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,160
Give me this.

145
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,200
Ten cents.

146
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,400
Could you use a little help with that?

147
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,480
Thank you, young man.

148
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,520
Well, heading north,
huh, Mulehall?

149
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,640
Yeah, man...

150
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,760
...heading north.

151
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,360
My old stomping grounds.

152
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,880
Where you from, Mulehouse?

153
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,160
Hey, man.

154
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,360
It's "Mulhall."

155
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,000
Mulhall.

156
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,720
Understand?

157
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,840
Where you from, Mulhall?

158
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
Bogalusa.

159
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,840
Where's that?

160
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,080
Above New Orleans.

161
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
Hot down there, ain't it?

162
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,320
Listen, man...

163
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,080
...call me "Mule."

164
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,760
Everybody else does.

165
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,800
- "Mule," okay?
- Okay.

166
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,440
Yes, sir.

167
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,640
They always used to have trouble
with my name too.

168
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
Buddusky.

169
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Always wanting to call me "Bad Ass."

170
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,680
"Bad Ass."

171
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
I am Bad Ass.

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,280
Bad Ass!

173
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,000
Is that true what the Chief said...

174
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,560
...about your getting...

175
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,320
...eight years and a dishonorable
discharge for stealing $40?

176
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,200
I didn't get no $40.

177
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,400
You didn't get it?

178
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,560
They caught me trying
to lift it from the box.

179
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
I didn't get it.

180
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,560
Jesus Christ! You mean to tell me
they gave you eight years and a D. D...

181
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,440
...and you didn't even get it?

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,160
Boy, they stuck it to him,
didn't they, Mule?

183
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,880
They sure as hell did.

184
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
They really stuck it to you, kid.

185
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,800
Stick it in and break it off.

186
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,240
Up your gigi with a wah-wah brush...

187
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,400
...stick it in and break it off.

188
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,240
Leave the kid alone.

189
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,360
I ain't bothering him.

190
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,080
Am I bothering you?

191
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,760
- No, sir.
- I ain't bothering him.

192
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,840
Just trying to be helpful.

193
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,160
So tell me,
how are you going to help him?

194
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,680
I want to ask you a few questions.

195
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,400
You don't have to answer,
but maybe I can help.

196
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Come on!

197
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,280
Now, before this polio thing,
did you have a record?

198
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
No. Well, not with the Navy.

199
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,480
I got in trouble a couple of times
with the cops before I enlisted.

200
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,160
I see.

201
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,560
Was it in the nature
of a serious offense?

202
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,720
For example, was it in the nature
of a felony or a misdemeanor?

203
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,200
Well, it was in the nature
of shoplifting.

204
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,320
But I never was in jail,
if that's what you mean.

205
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,880
You know, Meadows...

206
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,640
...this eight years, it ain't
necessarily eight years.

207
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,560
- It isn't?
- No, it isn't.

208
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,000
They're going to knock two years off
for good behavior.

209
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,520
So that's six years right there.

210
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,960
Really?

211
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
That's something.

212
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,360
Ain't it?

213
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,560
At least we got a long train ride.

214
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Man, I sure love trains!

215
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,920
It beats the shit out of sitting up
in Shit City, don't it?

216
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,000
Man, he didn't have those with him.

217
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,080
No, he didn't.

218
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,480
Why don't you take your coat off...?

219
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,400
Goddamn it! Halt, Meadows!

220
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,200
Halt!

221
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,520
I got him! All right, I got him!

222
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,960
You fucking asshole!

223
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,280
Let me go!

224
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,280
I got him!

225
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,600
I got him! I got him!

226
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,320
All right!
Don't you fucking move!

227
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,480
Sit down.

228
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,320
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,920
I'm sorry...

230
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,720
...for stealing the money.

231
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,760
I swear I didn't want it.

232
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm always stealing junk I don't need.

233
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,640
It's all right.
It's all right, Meadows.

234
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,920
Come on. Be a man.

235
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,040
Quart bottles of hair tonic,
model cars...

236
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,480
I couldn't even build a model car.

237
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,400
Just crap...

238
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,240
...you know?

239
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,760
I had money on the books.
You can ask anybody.

240
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,760
But it's gone now...

241
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,280
...because I got forfeiture on pay
and everything...

242
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
But I had money.

243
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,400
It's okay, man.

244
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,240
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

245
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
The kid's crazy.

246
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,280
Yeah, he ought to see
a fucking psychiatrist.

247
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,040
What about now, man?

248
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,360
We got a nut on our hands right now.
You know what I mean?

249
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,840
We ought to take him off the train
at Washington...

250
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,280
...walk him around a bit
till he gets cooled off.

251
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
He's a fucking mess.

252
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,600
Well, the last train
don't take off till 10:30.

253
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,160
Plenty of time for some good chow.

254
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,240
What do you want to eat, Meadows?

255
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,840
I don't know.

256
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,040
- What do you think?
- Looks good.

257
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,400
A little crowded.

258
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,520
What do you think, Meadows?

259
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,040
It's fine.

260
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,920
Think they'll melt the cheese on the
burgers? I like the cheese melted.

261
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,880
Do you see a booth in there, Mule?

262
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,080
It's a little crowded.

263
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,560
- Fuck the crowd. I'm hungry.
- Me too.

264
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,560
Maybe the next place, huh?

265
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,920
We're going to miss our train!

266
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,040
Who gives a shit?
So we miss the train.

267
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,040
We got five days!

268
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,200
Come on!

269
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,360
Is your word worth anything?

270
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,760
Sure it is.
As good as the next guy's.

271
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,760
The next guy's a prick!

272
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,520
What I mean is, Meadows...

273
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,040
...you aren't going to try and run away
while we're here in Washington, are you?

274
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,280
Forget about that.
Will you not bang into people...

275
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,280
...and embarrass us like that?

276
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,680
- And not steal anything?
- No, sir.

277
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,160
Goddamn it!

278
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,960
Hold still, Meadows.
Son of a bitch. All right.

279
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,160
No question about it.

280
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,200
- It almost gets you high.
- That's entertainment.

281
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,720
- Cheese melted enough for you?
- Sure.

282
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,960
It ain't melted at all.

283
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,440
Send it back!

284
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
Send the goddamn thing back.

285
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,160
- You're paying for it.
- It's all right.

286
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,280
Have it the way you want it.

287
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,440
Waiter!

288
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
Melt cheese for the chief, would you?

289
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,160
Thank you.

290
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,160
See, Meadows?

291
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,400
It's just as easy...

292
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,800
...to have it the way you want it.

293
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,240
Goddamn!

294
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,600
Hey!

295
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,720
Where's these malts at?

296
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,640
See what I mean, Meadows?

297
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,560
That's good.

298
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,880
Better catch that train.

299
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,600
We still got time for a beer.

300
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,560
Now wait a minute, man.

301
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,120
I ain't old enough.

302
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,360
You ain't old enough for what?

303
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,960
For a beer.

304
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,680
Everybody's old enough for a beer.

305
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,400
Ain't that right, Mule?

306
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,960
Well, I'm not.

307
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,960
I know a place right here.
It's nice and quiet.

308
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,200
Eight years and a D. D.,
at least we can buy the kid a beer.

309
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,200
Hi, Ed.

310
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,880
I'll take 30 cents worth of beer
in a glass...

311
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,880
...and the same for my shipmates.

312
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,520
Ed don't work here no more.

313
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,160
- Let me see your I. D. 's.
- How come?

314
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,040
Because this kid ain't old enough.

315
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,560
- Listen, pal...
- Listen yourself, pal.

316
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,920
The law says I have to serve him,
but...

317
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,920
I tell you what you do,
Mr. Citizen Bartender.

318
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,600
Take your beers
and ram them up your ass sideways.

319
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,400
- Can you dig it?
- Whoa there, sunshine.

320
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,480
We're going, so you can take your hand
off that horse cock...

321
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,760
...you got stashed under the bar.

322
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,280
How do you know I don't have
something with a little more bark to it?

323
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,080
This redneck's talking about firearms.

324
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,160
I know that you ain't got nothing
but wood under there...

325
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,800
...because I was here
when a certain sailor...

326
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,840
...got it up the side of his head.

327
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,120
What do you think about that, redneck?

328
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,760
The boss'd lose his license
for sure if I serve that kid.

329
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,720
I'll kick your ass around the block
for drill, man.

330
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,040
You try,
and I'll call the shore patrol.

331
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,400
I am the motherfucking shore patrol,
motherfucker!

332
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,760
I am the motherfucking
shore patrol!

333
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,200
Now give him a beer!

334
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,800
- I don't want...
- You're going to have a beer!

335
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,720
I don't feel like one right now.

336
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,640
Come on, man. Come on.

337
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,320
Come on, let's go!
Come on, man.

338
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,040
Man, you are a Bad Ass!

339
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,360
- I am, ain't I?
- Thought you'd blow his head off.

340
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,800
- What?
- You're a Bad Ass.

341
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,240
- A what?
- A Bad Ass!

342
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,960
- A what?!
- A Bad Ass!

343
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,360
You ain't leaving D. C.
till you got a belly full of beer!

344
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,400
Come on, kid! Jesus Christ!

345
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,080
Did you see that cracker asshole?

346
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,800
"The law says that I got to serve him,
but I..."

347
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,680
I thought he'd have a heart attack.

348
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,960
- Scared the shit out of him!
- He was scared!

349
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,440
He was ready to go!

350
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,080
He was gone!

351
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,040
I'd like to drink a toast to Batman...

352
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,360
...Superman...

353
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,520
...and the Human Torch!

354
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,920
What's a Human Torch?

355
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,480
A pure, white, Southern American boy.

356
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,440
The Human Torch...

357
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,120
...when he goes like this...

358
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,960
...he throws a ball of flames
up on you...

359
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,360
...and the fucking building
goes up in an explosion.

360
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,320
And he had a littler guy
that flies around with him.

361
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,840
The best goddamn drink
in the world, isn't it?

362
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,520
Maybe we can sneak it on the train
and finish it off there.

363
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,840
Know what I mean?

364
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,920
The train left
15 minutes ago.

365
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,000
What?

366
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,480
The train left 15 minutes ago.

367
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, that's nice! That's fucking nice!

368
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,920
For Christ's sake,
give me a break!

369
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,880
We got five days.
We're on per diem.

370
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,760
I say what we do...

371
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,640
...is check into a hotel...

372
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,800
...hoist up a few more...

373
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,640
...have a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow we get on the train.

374
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,040
Sunday.

375
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,880
What the fuck are you laughing at?

376
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,400
Laughing at that silly
son of a bitch over there.

377
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,640
That's what I'm laughing at.

378
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,880
Come on...

379
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,760
...let's get ourselves into...

380
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,080
I got to go to the bathroom!

381
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,400
...a hotel room.

382
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,400
Wonderful idea.

383
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
Prisoner...

384
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,440
...on your feet.

385
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,560
Come on.

386
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,320
Cheer up!

387
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,080
Ain't this the life, Mule?

388
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,560
It sure beats freezing your ass
in the alley, don't it?

389
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,120
Beats the hell out of being
back in Shit City too, don't it?

390
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,600
I bet it even beats being
at Portsmouth too.

391
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,400
You know, kid...

392
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,400
...you got a hell of a knack for
killing a conversation.

393
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,440
Just imagine that your hands...

394
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,320
...are the hands of a clock.

395
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
"A"...

396
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,160
...is twenty to six.

397
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,240
"B"...

398
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,840
...quarter to six.

399
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,800
"C"...

400
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,800
...ten to six.

401
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,800
"D"...

402
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,920
...straight up six o'clock...

403
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,320
Come on, man!

404
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,040
We're watching the movie.

405
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,680
Meadows, you want to learn
how to be a signalman?

406
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,440
After the movie, man!

407
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,920
I always tell a new
semaphore personality this...

408
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,480
...to ensure that you send
a more perfect semaphore.

409
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,520
Ready?
I don't expect you to get it perfect.

410
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,600
This just happens to require
a great deal of manual dexterity.

411
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,760
All right.

412
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,600
That was very good, Meadows.

413
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,840
Very good indeed.

414
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,800
You must have a flair for this
sort of thing.

415
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,200
Some people do.

416
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,360
I do, for instance.
I have a flair for this sort of thing.

417
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,200
We got it.

418
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,280
We fucking got it, boys.

419
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,880
Here it is.

420
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,840
The truck that...

421
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,080
Very nice catch.

422
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,480
The truck that made your mama's son.

423
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,240
Motherfucking Jesus H. Christ!

424
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,880
You guys mind if I say something?

425
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,080
That guy at the bar...

426
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,360
...why did you get so mad at him?

427
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,720
I don't blame him
not giving me a beer.

428
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,800
Don't you never get mad at nobody?

429
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,760
Yeah, sure. I do. Yeah.

430
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,840
Who do you get mad at?

431
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,880
Well, not at somebody
who's doing their job.

432
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,280
Who then?

433
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,560
Injustice.

434
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,400
Bullshit!

435
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,440
You don't never get mad at nobody.
You're just a pussy.

436
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,160
I do too get mad.

437
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,200
Did you ever get mad at the old man
for what he done to you?

438
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
Well, he was just...

439
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,480
Doing his job.

440
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,880
They're going to take eight years
out of your life.

441
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,800
Six years. You said six.

442
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,640
What the fuck difference does it make?
You don't even care about it.

443
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,040
Hey, come on, Bad Ass.

444
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,160
- That don't help him.
- Fuck help!

445
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,040
I mean, fuck fair.
Fuck injustice.

446
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,640
Don't you ever just
want to stomp on someone...

447
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,080
...and bite off their ear,
just to do it?

448
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,400
Just to get it out of your system?

449
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,840
Well, I do remember something
I got mad at.

450
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,080
Something when I was in the brig
a marine did.

451
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,120
What happened? Grunts beat you up?

452
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,480
But that didn't get me mad.

453
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,320
Well, goddamn it,
what did get you mad?

454
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,080
This marine guard...

455
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,680
...he asked me if I believed
in Jesus Christ.

456
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,280
I said, "Yeah."

457
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,680
And he said that from now on...

458
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,320
...he was Jesus Christ,
and I shouldn't ever forget it.

459
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,160
What'd you do?

460
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,400
Did you hit him?

461
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,840
Can you imagine that?
That's awful!

462
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,440
Did you coldcock him?

463
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,600
He better hope the chaplain
don't catch him.

464
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,840
Most of the chaplains I know...

465
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,640
...want to stand up on the bridge
with the old man...

466
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,840
...and look through aviator sunglasses.

467
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,680
It takes a lot of dedication
to be a Navy chaplain.

468
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,920
Don't take diddlyshit, man!

469
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,880
Come on.

470
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,160
Come on. Come on!
Take a fucking poke at me!

471
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,000
Take a poke at me. Come on.

472
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,920
- Come on.
- What for?

473
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,440
I'll punch you out...

474
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,560
Punch me out, you little prick!

475
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,600
- He won't punch you. You know that.
- I'll make him!

476
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,800
Bad Ass, I like you.

477
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,880
Yeah, I like you.

478
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,720
I'm taking you to jail,
motherfucker.

479
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,240
That ain't your fault.

480
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,960
Come on, Mule!

481
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,360
Come on, goddamn it!

482
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,240
Bad Ass?

483
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,720
Would you teach me the hand signals?

484
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,200
I don't give a shit!

485
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,600
One time...

486
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,080
...when I was down in Long Beach...

487
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,800
...this friend of mine
was looking for me...

488
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,680
...and I was up
on top of the car...

489
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,040
...and I pissed on his head.

490
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,040
Just being crazy, you know what I mean?

491
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
Don't you get crazy with me!

492
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,240
I think I'm going to be sick again.

493
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,800
How're we going to work this out?

494
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,880
Work what out?

495
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,640
Who gets what bed!

496
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,440
What the fuck difference does it make?

497
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,480
Well, I can't take...

498
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,840
...this shit indefinitely, man.

499
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,560
What shit?

500
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
Somebody's got to make a decision.

501
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,360
There you go.

502
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,520
Just remember...

503
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,320
...rank has it privileges.

504
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,760
Wait a minute.

505
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,440
They make them shit here.

506
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
What?

507
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,960
All we got to do is
get off the train at Philly...

508
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,200
...and take a bus to Camden.

509
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,560
What's the matter with that?

510
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,720
It's a couple hours.

511
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,120
He didn't ask to see his mother.

512
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,920
He wouldn't ask...

513
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,600
...to go to the head if he had the runs.

514
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm telling you,
he wants to see his mother.

515
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,240
How do we know she's home?

516
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,120
- It's Sunday!
- Sunday?

517
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,720
What's that supposed to mean?

518
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,800
Come on!

519
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,080
You want to go see your mother?

520
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,960
I don't want to get you guys
in trouble or nothing.

521
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,880
You've been so good
to me already.

522
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,640
Let's go and see your mother.

523
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,840
Don't worry about it, Mule.
Know what I mean?

524
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,480
That's Calvin Coolidge Junior High.

525
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,000
I went there.

526
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,960
Where's your old man, Meadows?

527
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,360
Seattle.

528
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,120
Seattle, Washington.

529
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,880
I know where it is. What's he doing?

530
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,880
I think he works in a hardware store.

531
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,480
He's married.

532
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, I mean not to my mother,
but to somebody else.

533
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Maybe I even have a half sister.
I think I do.

534
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,760
Camden High!

535
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,320
I graduated from there.

536
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,040
Miss Marabito.

537
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,960
I wonder if she still teaches there.

538
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,040
She made me want to be a veterinarian.

539
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,600
You want to check next door or anything?

540
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,920
Your mom have any friends
in the neighborhood?

541
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,200
- Mrs. Esposito.
- Maybe she's over there.

542
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,600
Her car's gone.

543
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,560
What do you want to do?

544
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,080
You want to wait around a little?

545
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,320
We could wait around a little.

546
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,120
I'll go check with Mrs. Esposito.

547
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,440
- Legs really bother you, don't they?
- Sometimes.

548
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,600
You ought to take vitamins.

549
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,760
No, take vitamins. Seriously, man.

550
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,760
Go to the dispensary.

551
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,360
- What's wrong?
- We let him go by himself!

552
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,720
He could get away!

553
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,560
Don't get excited.
That kid ain't going nowhere.

554
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,120
What makes you so sure?

555
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,200
Well, you know him.

556
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,400
Jesus Christ!

557
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,160
Then where is he?

558
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,800
Where is he?

559
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,240
There.

560
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,400
Don't get your balls in an uproar.
Meadows ain't going nowhere without us.

561
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,200
Let me tell you something
about a kid like Meadows.

562
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,240
He's the kind of guy,
he's going to the brig...

563
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,840
...and secretly he's probably glad.

564
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,880
On the outside, too many things
can happen to him, all of it bad.

565
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,600
This way, the worse part's
already happening.

566
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,280
He's probably glad.

567
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,200
Glad.

568
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,280
If you ain't right...

569
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,840
...you better be quick,
because I ain't.

570
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,600
She went for the day.

571
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,480
Sunday!

572
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,880
You want to go in and wait awhile?

573
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,040
What for?

574
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,960
Well, she might come home early.

575
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,920
No, thanks.

576
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,640
Well, at least you could sit
in your own house.

577
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,160
Maybe we can get in.

578
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,200
I don't know what
I would've said to her anyway.

579
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,600
You know what Meadows ought to do?

580
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,720
He ought to get his old lady
to write her congressman.

581
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,880
She can write letters to her congressman
till she owns the fucking post office!

582
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,840
It don't mean diddlyshit!

583
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,600
Look, either we let him go
or he lives with it.

584
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,440
And we ain't about to let him go.
Understand?

585
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
Now look what you made him do.

586
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,920
- What I made him do?
- Yeah.

587
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,680
- Where you going?
- To the head, okay?

588
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,160
If that don't make you just
want to shit in your flat hat, man.

589
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,680
Look what you went... Look what you...
I hope you're satisfied!

590
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,760
You're the one insisted
we take him to see his mother!

591
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,480
I hate this detail.

592
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,560
I hate this fucking
chicken-shit detail!

593
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,280
I love the fucking detail, I suppose.
What am I supposed to do?

594
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,840
I'm just trying to...

595
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,480
Meadows?

596
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,640
Meadows, open up!

597
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,320
Meadows, you all right?

598
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,960
You all right?

599
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,280
I consider myself in jeopardy with you.
Understand?

600
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,760
In jeopardy.

601
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,200
This ain't no farewell party,
and he ain't retiring.

602
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,480
Understand?

603
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,200
He's a prisoner, and
we're taking him to jail.

604
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,480
You have a tendency to forget that.

605
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,320
You're a menace, man!

606
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,280
You ain't no simple shit.
You're a motherfucking menace!

607
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,240
From now on, MAA can go
piss up a rope. You ain't no honcho!

608
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,320
I don't want to hear more of
this psychology jive!

609
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,680
No more turning his head around
to prove what a big man you are!

610
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,400
You're a lifer like me!

611
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,480
Navy's the best thing
ever happened to me.

612
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,840
I don't want you to fuck me up.
You understand?

613
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,400
- Buddusky?
- I hear you.

614
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
Do you agree?

615
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,600
I was just trying to show him
a good time. Know what I mean?

616
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,680
He can't have a good time.
It ain't in him.

617
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,720
- He had a good time in Washington.
- All right.

618
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,840
He had a good time in Washington.

619
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,880
Think that'll make it any
easier to pull his eight years?

620
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,320
It won't. It'll make it harder.

621
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,320
So what.

622
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,480
You know what I mean?

623
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,760
Your attention, please.

624
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,040
Amtrak 211 for Chicago, boarding...

625
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,080
...in 10 minutes at gate three.

626
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,280
Amtrak 211 for Chicago...

627
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,120
...boarding at gate three.

628
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,000
We go this way.

629
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,080
The train for Boston leaves
in two hours.

630
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,160
We don't leave the building until then.
Understand?

631
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,680
You got a quarter?

632
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,080
Where are you going?

633
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,480
Head.

634
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
All right?

635
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,880
Sailor looks like he's lost something.

636
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,680
Probably have trouble finding it
with those 13 buttons.

637
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,800
If I was a Marine, I wouldn't
have to fuck with no 13 buttons.

638
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,520
I'd just take my hat off.

639
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,840
Hi, boys.

640
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,160
- I call it karate!
- I call it motherfucker!

641
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,840
What's going on here?

642
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,040
Come on...

643
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,480
Wipe your nose, will you, kid?

644
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,360
He fought like a champ, though,
didn't he? Jesus.

645
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,920
Goddamn, that was great.

646
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,680
It was great, wasn't it?

647
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,880
It was great. Admit it!
Give me a little of this!

648
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,440
Give me just because
they call me Shine in here.

649
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,440
I got your greatness.

650
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,880
Meadows, over here...

651
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,840
...they have the finest Italian sausage
sandwiches in the world...

652
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,320
...and I'm buying.

653
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,520
Goddamn...

654
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,560
I ask you, man.

655
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,760
Where else in the world can you get
a sandwich like this?

656
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,720
And for 50 cents!

657
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,680
I never ate anything so good.

658
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,920
I ain't shitting you.

659
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,680
I'm going to have to have
another one of these.

660
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,680
I'd like a little more onions.

661
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,600
- Little more? There's some.
- How about some of these?

662
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,200
You got it.

663
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
We got to figure out what to do.

664
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,240
And we will.

665
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,600
We will.

666
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,720
Only we're going to do it
over a bottle of Heineken's.

667
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,960
What's Heineken's?

668
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,680
The finest beer in the world, kid.

669
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,120
President Kennedy used to drink it.

670
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Goddamned Dutch soup is about all...

671
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,680
Double up, there.

672
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,440
Want to get in this
or do you want to keep quiet?

673
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,320
All right, how'd you do?

674
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,160
Help me get Buddusky out.
He's betting with our travel money.

675
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,600
Hope this won't go in the toilet.

676
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,360
He's losing too.

677
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,400
All right, gentlemen.

678
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,840
It's you and me, one on one.

679
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,960
Easy money, eh?

680
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,400
What do you think?
Here's to you.

681
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,440
Cheers.

682
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,920
You want the honors?

683
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,160
You go ahead.

684
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,240
Don't worry about a thing.

685
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,040
I'm hustling this guy, understand?
I got him right where I want him.

686
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,920
Maybe he's hustling you.

687
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,800
Maybe he is, but this isn't the time
to argue about it...

688
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,320
...because if I don't win,
we don't leave New York.

689
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,960
Fourteen years.

690
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,360
Fourteen motherfucking years.

691
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,720
This'll make him go crazy.

692
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,680
The man is going to hustle me,
with glasses.

693
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,120
Fifty-four...

694
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,000
...sixty-one...

695
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,160
...sixty-three dollars.
That's $21...

696
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,320
...apiece.

697
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,800
Apiece?

698
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,960
Sure, we're partners, ain't we?

699
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,440
Yeah, Bad Ass.

700
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,120
Then take your fucking 21 bucks and
don't give me such a hard time.

701
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,600
For you, back here.
Right here.

702
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,440
Bravo, Yankee. Bravo, Yankee.

703
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,720
You're damn right.

704
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,200
"Dead man," in Russian.

705
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,240
That was damn good, kid.

706
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,560
You ought to put in for signalman.

707
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,920
What's that?

708
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,680
I don't know. I hear it too.

709
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,680
What the hell is an "Indiana dog"?

710
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,480
Goddamn, that's the goddamnedest thing
I ever heard!

711
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,840
- What is that?
- Hey, let's go take a look.

712
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,960
I mean, what the hell?
Eight years and a D. D.

713
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,400
What are we going to do?

714
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,960
Take off your shoes.

715
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,480
Must be one of them Jap joints
where we got to take off our shoes.

716
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,480
What are they saying?

717
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,720
Hold it down.

718
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,720
I think we're in a church.

719
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,160
Good evening.

720
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,440
Good evening!

721
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,040
Welcome to Nichiren Shoshu meeting.

722
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,840
Tonight throughout the city there
are hundreds of meetings like this.

723
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,360
Where people learn about
Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and Gohonzon.

724
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,520
What's a Gohonzon?

725
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,320
I'll tell you about it later.

726
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,160
We're going to do that
through the experiences we've had.

727
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,840
Who's had an experience?

728
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,000
Good evening!

729
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,240
When I first started chanting...

730
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,520
...I wanted to find a girl
that I could relate to...

731
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,680
She took me to a meeting like this.

732
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,960
I remember thinking,
"These people are out of their minds!"

733
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,200
But later we went to her apartment,
and I tried her Gohonzon.

734
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,360
Come on, what's a Gohonzon?

735
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,320
I'll tell you later.

736
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,160
And now I really love the clarinet...

737
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,520
...and I can't remember why
I wanted a flute in the first place.

738
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,040
There's a sun
shining in your heart

739
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,960
There's a song
waiting to be sung

740
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,960
There's a dream
longing to be free

741
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,560
In your life
happiness you'll see

742
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,360
Bring it out
Your shining light

743
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,880
You can change this world
of trouble and strife

744
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,320
Why does all of this
make me feel so fucking bad?

745
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,240
Bring it out now
Bring it out now

746
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,640
Bring it out now,
hey!

747
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,640
A bunch of candy-asses.

748
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,160
Ever hear such happy horseshit?

749
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,240
That one guy was a big homo, huh?

750
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Yeah, but you guys,
he sure was a happy homo.

751
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,960
If you're going to chant, let's figure
out what you're going to chant for.

752
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,400
How about I get sprung from Portsmouth?

753
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,520
Let's see if it works.

754
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,000
Then you can chant
for something really big.

755
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,760
Yeah, like how's about
the three of us get laid, huh?

756
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,440
Should you chant
for something like that?

757
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,840
Why the fuck not?

758
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,480
Well, it's a religion!

759
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,640
You're too good to believe!

760
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,440
"Yodeling in the canyon."

761
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,720
Ever heard of it?

762
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,680
You ever done that before?

763
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,760
Not exactly, no.

764
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,880
Are they really doing that
when they take that picture?

765
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,520
Well, kid, there's more things in this
life than you can possibly imagine.

766
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,920
I knew a whore once in Wilmington.

767
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,840
She had a...

768
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,320
...glass eye.

769
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,800
She used to take it out
and wink people off for a dollar.

770
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,600
Really?

771
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,320
There's still some room for your rank.
You want it?

772
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,960
No, I don't think so.

773
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,360
Yeah, come on, kid.
It's time you made your rate.

774
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,320
They busted me to E-1.
You know that.

775
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,800
Listen, right now
we're a navy of three.

776
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,440
Pick a rate. Any rate.

777
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,760
I can make you anything I want to
because I'm the honcho.

778
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,440
What'll it be?

779
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,120
Chief Signalman?

780
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,720
Okay, partner.

781
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,960
L. Meadows, S. M. C.

782
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,040
Show me some moves, kid!

783
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,880
Look, he don't know what to do.

784
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,480
He don't know!

785
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,320
He looks like a
goddamn big penguin, don't he?

786
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,440
Watch out for children!

787
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,120
- Hey, look...
- Cruise right through them!

788
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,240
Give them the spinner, kid!

789
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,760
He sure is having a good time.

790
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,440
Sure is. And you said
it wasn't in him.

791
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,680
All right.

792
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,440
Watch out for the Indian, kid!

793
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,720
Don't crush somebody.

794
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,560
Look at the size of this guy
on roller skates.

795
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,560
I was wondering if we're done.

796
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,920
It worked!

797
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,160
I chanted to stay on my feet and I did.
It worked.

798
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,520
Lighten up, will you, Meadows? Jesus!

799
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,840
You're chanting!

800
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,640
I'm a member of Nichiren Shoshu.
My name's Donna.

801
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,640
How do you do?

802
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,720
Hello.

803
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,120
What are you chanting for?

804
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,040
Go ahead, Meadows.
Tell her what you're chanting for.

805
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,680
A girl?

806
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,440
That's okay.
You can chant for anything.

807
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,400
- What's your name?
- Meadows.

808
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,960
- Your first name.
- Larry.

809
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,120
Why don't you come over
and meet some people?

810
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,800
Just for a minute.

811
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,880
Come on. We'll be right back.

812
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,760
If this guy gets pussy out of this,
I'm gonna eat my fucking flat hat.

813
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,640
I'm going
to start chanting too.

814
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,360
Hey, you guys? Drop your socks and grab
your cocks. We're going to a party.

815
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,480
This could be the big one,
eh, Meadows?

816
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,160
You just moved in?

817
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,400
Not too long ago. I think I
might move out again too.

818
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,720
- It's a problem, finding a place.
- This is a nice party.

819
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,080
Might as well be at a fucking bus stop.

820
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,840
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

821
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,200
Hey, I'm telling you, Mule,
we got it made.

822
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,080
All we got to do is get rid of
that creep there...

823
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,600
...and we got these three chicks
to ourselves.

824
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,160
We have, huh?

825
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,760
Yeah. Why not?

826
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,600
Because those three chicks would rather
fuck each other than us, that's why not.

827
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,320
There's nothing...

828
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,480
...like being on the sea...

829
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,880
...even in the Navy.

830
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,560
Being on the bridge...

831
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,360
...doing a man's job...

832
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,840
That's great.

833
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,240
Where you going?

834
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,240
I'm not putting down the government.
I just want him to tell me one thing.

835
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,120
There must be one thing
you don't like about Nixon.

836
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,240
You sure have a lot of records.

837
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,120
I get most of them free.
I work in the business.

838
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,320
What business?

839
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,240
- I smoked grass.
- Huh?

840
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,200
I smoked grass, Bad Ass.

841
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,000
I'm giving this girl such a line
of horseshit. It is unbelievable!

842
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,680
She loves it. She loves it!

843
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,960
Doing a man's job...

844
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,880
...talking to ships...

845
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,840
...across miles and miles...

846
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,920
...of liquid real estate.

847
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,920
Ooh, big time.

848
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,080
How come you don't
see more black officers?

849
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,440
Because you need a recommendation
from a white man, usually.

850
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,280
- How can you stay...
- Nothing Nixon says disturbs you?

851
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,040
Just tell me, is that right?

852
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,000
Henry, you're driving me crazy.

853
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,280
You guys on leave, or what?

854
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,920
"Liberty," you mean.

855
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,320
Liberty.

856
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,480
No.

857
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,640
Well, what are you guys doing anyway?

858
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,600
They're taking me to jail.

859
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,200
I've seen things.
Seen men do things that...

860
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,240
...I wouldn't even begin to tell you
at a time like this, my fair darling.

861
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,000
- I can see what it's done for you.
- Can you?

862
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,800
That's wonderful.

863
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,440
Must be the uniform.

864
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,160
- They are cute, aren't they?
- Oh, yeah.

865
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,800
I like the way...
You know what I like about it?

866
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,760
One of my favorite things
about this uniform...

867
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,280
...is the way
it makes your dick look.

868
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,000
How did you feel about
going to Vietnam?

869
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,680
The man says, "Go."
I got to do what the man says.

870
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,720
We're living in this man's world,
ain't we?

871
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,960
Oh, wow!

872
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,600
Eight years.

873
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I get two off.

874
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,720
So it's only six.

875
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,800
Why don't you get away?

876
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,880
Get away?

877
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,080
To Canada.

878
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,880
I've got this friend, George Lucido!

879
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,120
He Shakabukued me!
He's a group chief in Toronto.

880
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,360
I'll give you his number.

881
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,080
I couldn't.

882
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,440
Why not?

883
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,240
It would be their ass.

884
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,040
What do you owe them?

885
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,640
They're my best friends, Donna.

886
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,480
Come on.

887
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,840
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

888
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,520
You know what I mean?

889
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,400
What?

890
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,240
It's up to you...

891
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,400
...but I'm going to chant for you.

892
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,680
I'm going to chant for you
with my whole heart.

893
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,920
Chant?

894
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,480
Yes...

895
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,120
...that you get away.

896
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,840
Bad Ass?

897
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,560
What the fuck is it now, Meadows?

898
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,960
If you're Catholic, do you think
it's sacrilegious to chant?

899
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,560
- Did it get you laid?
- No.

900
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,080
Then, Meadows, what the fuck do you
want to go on chanting for?

901
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,840
Chant your ass off, kid.
But any pussy you get in this world...

902
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,600
...you have to pay for,
one way or another.

903
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,120
Hallelujah!

904
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,360
When do we get to Boston?

905
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,600
Two hours.

906
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,880
What time we got to be in Portsmouth?

907
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,000
Not after 1800 tomorrow.

908
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,920
Well, what do you think?

909
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,600
- I think we ought to get the kid laid.
- Laid?

910
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,800
Ever heard of it?

911
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,680
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir?

912
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,960
I asked for my eggs over easy.

913
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,400
They are over easy, sir.

914
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,880
No, they're not.

915
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,440
I'm learning. I'm learning.

916
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,800
Oh, Jesus!

917
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,920
You're taking the kid
to the cathouse, ain't you?

918
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,440
Yeah. Come on, Mule.

919
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,840
He's 18 years old.
He ain't never been fucked.

920
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,600
Next chance he gets,
he's going to be 26.

921
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,160
He might not want any by then.

922
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,720
You mean right now?
Just go ahead and do it?

923
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,400
No. Not this exact minute.

924
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,240
Later on tonight.

925
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,360
I think I would.

926
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,280
- Yeah, get the old ashes hauled.
- "Ashes hauled"?

927
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,840
- What are we doing?
- Huh?

928
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,680
- What are we doing?
- Looking for a certain guy.

929
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,400
Here, here, here.
This one right here.

930
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,280
How're they treating you, partner?

931
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,040
Fine, sailor. Where to?

932
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,000
Just down the road.

933
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,040
Let me tell you
what we really want.

934
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,840
You look honest.
I think I can trust you.

935
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,120
We're in transit,
the three of us, see, and...

936
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,560
We could use
the services of a decent whorehouse.

937
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,680
Know what I mean?

938
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,160
One that don't hate Gls.

939
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,440
Sizable tip in it for you.

940
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,520
Save the tip. I get it
at the other end.

941
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,200
Hey, thanks a lot.

942
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,440
I've been in transit a few times too.

943
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,680
I'm an old minesweep sailor myself.

944
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,320
Oh, yeah? You're a swabbie?
I thought you was. I did.

945
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,480
I thought he was a swabbie.
Minesweep, eh?

946
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,520
Hi, boys.

947
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,840
I'm Millie.

948
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,840
- Hi, Millie.
- Come on in.

949
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,800
- Thank you.
- The Navy's always welcome here.

950
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,560
Too late for Captain Kangaroo, ladies?

951
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,000
Here, let me tell you how it is, Mil.

952
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,480
We got a friend we'd like to do
a favor for. He's going on a trip.

953
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,880
- Just him?
- Just him, yeah.

954
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,200
What kind of party you after?

955
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,720
Well, it's his party.

956
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,680
You name it, sailor.

957
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,880
Okay, sailor.
Take your pick.

958
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,760
Pick a winner, kid.

959
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,760
Make it a good one, honey.
It's got to last a long time.

960
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,000
Sure, honey. Anything you say.

961
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,600
You know what I mean?

962
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,640
Kid, you picked a real winner.

963
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,480
You boys just make
yourselves comfortable.

964
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,680
Goddamn! He picked the same one
I would have.

965
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,840
She's a cute little thing, isn't she?

966
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,600
Your coat, honey.

967
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,200
Come over here by the sink.
Let me check you out.

968
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,320
You're not going to have
a bit of trouble.

969
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,320
Jesus Christ!

970
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,440
Well, that's what I call "quick."

971
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,480
Look, those are the rules. Doesn't
matter if it's 10 hours or 10 seconds.

972
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,000
Okay, tootsie. We'll stake him
to another shot.

973
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,080
I'm sorry.

974
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,400
You want to try it again, kid?

975
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,040
Yeah.

976
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,120
Okay, honey.

977
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,400
Don't worry, kid.
Plenty more where that came from.

978
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,400
You got all night, kid.

979
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,800
You ever been married?

980
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,920
Not so you'd notice.

981
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,480
Once.

982
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,480
A little girl in Torrance.

983
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,360
Know where that is?

984
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,000
It's near San Pedro, on the way
to Terminal Island, you know?

985
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,280
Dottie Brown.

986
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,760
She had great tits and wore
angora sweaters all the time.

987
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,760
She wanted me to go to trade school
and become a TV repairman.

988
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,720
Drive around all that smog and shit...

989
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,520
...fixing TVs out of the back
of a VW bus.

990
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,400
I just couldn't do it.

991
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,600
You ever been married?

992
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,120
I still support my mama.

993
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,400
She can't brag enough about me.

994
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,240
Tells everybody all the places I go,
how many men are under me...

995
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,040
...all that shit.

996
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,120
Yeah, man...

997
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,240
...I don't know what I would've done
without the Navy.

998
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,920
I guess we're just a couple of lifers.

999
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,320
How was...

1000
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,960
How was what, honey?

1001
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,720
Well, you got off to a shaky start.

1002
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,040
After that, you took to it
like a duck to water.

1003
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,040
I don't know if I have
enough money to go again...

1004
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,520
...but I'll pay you what I have...

1005
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,720
...just to look at you.

1006
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,600
Just to what?

1007
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,600
Look at you.

1008
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,560
Guess you haven't seen many girls
with their clothes off, have you?

1009
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,880
Well, let me tell you.
I've got a good body.

1010
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,160
Not great, but pretty good.

1011
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,480
It's beautiful.

1012
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,080
What did she say again?

1013
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,280
"Let me check you out, honey."

1014
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,280
I swear to God.

1015
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:09,240
Like I was in a gas station
and she was checking the oil.

1016
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,960
- And then...
- Then we know what happened.

1017
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,040
Yeah, but after. After...

1018
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,320
Well, maybe it was an act for her.

1019
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,520
I mean, I know she was a whore...

1020
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,600
...but I think she liked me.

1021
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,560
They got feelings just like
everybody else, kid. She probably did.

1022
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,720
Well, it was real for me.

1023
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,360
That's what counts.

1024
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,640
Welcome to the wonderful world
of pussy, kid. The sink's yours.

1025
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,960
We don't have to be there till 1800.

1026
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,600
It takes an hour and a half
to get to Portsmouth.

1027
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,600
We could go see a movie or two.

1028
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,760
We can get us a couple of six-packs.

1029
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,920
Shit, we can even go back
to the cathouse if you want to.

1030
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,120
No.

1031
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,680
I already did everything one time.

1032
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,320
That makes that one time stick out.
You know what I mean?

1033
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,840
- It sure is a shit day.
- Ain't it the truth.

1034
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,560
Yeah, it is.

1035
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,400
If it was summer, we could maybe
have a picnic.

1036
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,320
Son of a bitch!

1037
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,520
Thank you.

1038
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:14,000
This wood's too fucking green, man.
It ain't going to burn.

1039
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,520
Wet wood.

1040
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,600
Wait a minute!

1041
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,960
- What are you looking for?
- Buns.

1042
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,000
I forgot them.

1043
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,520
- You forgot the buns?
- Yeah.

1044
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,480
How can you eat a hot dog
without a bun?

1045
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,480
- It's not a hot dog without...
- Don't eat the fucking thing, then!

1046
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,200
Shit!

1047
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,320
It ain't bad.

1048
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,600
Shit!

1049
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,840
- I don't want no fucking hot dogs.
- He don't eat them without buns.

1050
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,720
It's kind of like being at sea.

1051
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,320
I was on a weather ship once...

1052
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,360
...off of Greenland.

1053
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,680
Right in the middle of winter.

1054
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,480
How was it?

1055
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,840
I like being at sea.

1056
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,800
Kid's come a long way
in the last few days, ain't he?

1057
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,040
Let's get this over with.

1058
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,560
He don't stand a chance
in Portsmouth, you know.

1059
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,240
You know that, don't you?

1060
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,720
Goddamn grunts kicking the shit
out of him for eight years.

1061
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,080
He don't stand a chance.

1062
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,640
I don't want to hear about it.

1063
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,960
"Maggot" this. "Maggot" that.

1064
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,280
Marines are really assholes,
you know that?

1065
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,840
It takes a certain kind of a sadistic
temperament to be a Marine.

1066
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,440
What the fuck's he doing?

1067
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,960
Hey, Meadows!

1068
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,640
What's he doing?

1069
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,360
"Bravo...

1070
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,000
...Yankee...

1071
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,960
...Bravo, Yankee.
Bye-bye. End of the word."

1072
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,880
Hey, this son of a bitch
is running away!

1073
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,920
Halt, you son of a bitch!

1074
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,360
Halt! You motherfucker!

1075
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:53,920
Buddusky, don't!

1076
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:54,920
Don't!

1077
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,840
Goddamn, I lost my fucking shoe!

1078
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,880
Let me go!

1079
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,280
Buddusky, don't!

1080
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,680
Let me go, you bastard!

1081
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,400
Please let me go!

1082
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,080
I lost my fucking shoe!

1083
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,880
Baker, Mooney, prisoner from Norfolk,
on the double!

1084
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,600
Where'd you get the idea
that wearing an armband...

1085
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,320
...and a sidearm entitles you
to abuse a prisoner?

1086
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,200
They teach you that in the Navy?

1087
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,120
Or was that your idea of a good time?

1088
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,400
I guess.

1089
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,720
You guess what, sailor?

1090
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,160
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1091
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,880
Nothing, sir.

1092
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,320
- Did the prisoner offer any resistance?
- No, sir.

1093
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,320
Did he try to escape?

1094
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,200
Not exactly.

1095
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,680
That's a little vague.
Either he did or didn't. Which is it?

1096
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,000
Don't look at him
for the answer. Which is it?

1097
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,680
- He didn't.
- He didn't what?

1098
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,400
He didn't try to escape.

1099
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,160
He didn't try to escape, "sir."

1100
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,320
He didn't try to escape, sir.

1101
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,040
You haven't left yet.

1102
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:00,760
Sir?

1103
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:05,040
Your orders weren't endorsed. According
to this, you're still in Norfolk.

1104
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,760
Well, we're standing here.

1105
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,080
It's not our fault.

1106
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,400
You haven't left yet.

1107
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,080
- You haven't left!
- That's not our fault!

1108
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,560
Look, sir. We both got
a lot of time in.

1109
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,360
What's that supposed to mean?

1110
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,040
Too much time to be hard-ass
because some dude in Norfolk...

1111
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,280
...forgot to endorse our orders.

1112
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,520
You're asking for trouble.

1113
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,680
I'm asking to see the XO.

1114
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,080
Deep trouble!

1115
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,280
No.

1116
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,840
We ain't about to say
anything else until we see the XO.

1117
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,040
Get the hell out of here.

1118
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,320
You're supposed to pull a few copies.

1119
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,120
Goddamn grunts!

1120
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,560
Think they can get away with anything!

1121
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,760
Telling me how to do my job.
I know my job.

1122
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,960
I know my goddamn job better than
anybody else in the goddamn Navy!

1123
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,840
We really told him though, didn't we?

1124
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,800
Trying to ream our ass...

1125
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,280
...and he don't even have sense
to pull a few goddamn copies!

1126
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:52,520

I hate this motherfucking,
chicken shit detail.

1128
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,880
Where are you going?

1129
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,320
- Norfolk.
- I mean now.

1130
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,080
I don't know. Stop off
in Baltimore maybe. You?

1131
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,200
Back to New York, I guess.

1132
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,400
See you in Norfolk.

1133
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:20,320
Yeah. Maybe our fucking orders
have come through.
