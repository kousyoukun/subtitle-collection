1
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,445
Buddusky!

2
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,548
Either of you guys seen Buddusky?

3
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,643
Buddusky!

4
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,558
What?

5
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,564
MAA sent me.

6
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,797
He wants to see you right away.

7
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,770
Tell MAA to go fuck himself.

8
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,280
Well, he said, "Right away."

9
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,676
Come on, Buddusky.

10
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,056
It's your ass if you don't.

11
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,093
Look, maybe your orders came through.

12
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,860
Come on, Buddusky!

13
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,533
It's your ass.

14
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,694
Bullshit.

15
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,271
My ass!

16
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,837
Mulhall!

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,310
Master-at-arms wants
to see you right away.

18
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,449
I ain't going on no shit detail.

19
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,555
Come on! It's my ass if you don't.

20
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,884
I ain't going on no shit detail!

21
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,422
It's your ass too. Come on, Mule.

22
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,563
Maybe your orders came through.

23
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,857
Tell the MAA you couldn't find me.

24
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,966
He knows where you are.

25
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,229
When you're in the Navy
and in transit...

26
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,269
...nobody knows where you are!

27
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,567
Go tell the MAA to fuck himself.

28
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,903
I ain't going on no shit detail!

29
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,639
Morning.

30
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,642
You are one lucky son of a bitch...

31
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,878
...Bad Ass!

32
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,819
You are one lucky son of a bitch!

33
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,218
Where am I going, Chief?

34
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,192
How come you're so lucky, Buddusky?

35
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,557
You're another lucky son of a bitch.

36
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,062
You dudes pulled
temporary duty as chasers.

37
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,531
Where to?

38
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,504
Portsmouth Naval Prison.

39
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,105
- Who we taking?
- Seaman.

40
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,875
Used to be.

41
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,780
Meadows, Lawrence M.
Drew eight years and a D.D.

42
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,391
Jesus, what the hell did he do?
Kill the old man?

43
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,524
Come on inside.

44
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,925
Sweek!
Get these old boys some coffee.

45
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,395
All right, Chief.

46
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,164
Who'd he kill, Chief?

47
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,943
Didn't kill nobody. Robbery.

48
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,701
How much did he lift?

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,274
Forty dollars.

50
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,880
Forty dollars!

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,380
Forty dollars.

52
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
You're shitting me!

53
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,250
I wouldn't shit you.

54
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,090
You're my favorite turd.

55
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,417
Jesus!

56
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,830
Eight years and a D.D. for $40.

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,464
I thought they only pulled that
shit in the Army!

58
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,567
You see, he tried...

59
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,503
...to lift the polio contribution box.

60
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,940
Polio box is the old man's old lady's...

61
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,677
...favorite do-gooder project.

62
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,854
She's responsible for all the polio
contributions on the base, you know?

63
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,925
Every year, they give her a plaque.

64
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,790
Along comes Meadows
and fucks over charity.

65
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,591
She took it very seriously.

66
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,994
- Jesus!
- Eight years.

67
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,502
That's very seriously.

68
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,074
You know what I mean?

69
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,436
Good duty for you guys.
Get to go to Washington...

70
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,073
...New York...

71
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,006
...Boston.

72
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,384
I'd trade places with you.

73
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,888
Listen...

74
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,965
...we could get this guy
to Portsmouth in two days.

75
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,160
Less.

76
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,937
They're going to give us a week.
You know what I mean?

77
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,075
So what?

78
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,372
We get there in two days, they won't
give us no week to get back.

79
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,741
Bullshit!

80
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,241
Besides...

81
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,045
...they got to give us
all that per diem, regardless.

82
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,279
That's money for you,
for me and for him.

83
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,654
We run this little shitbird's ass
all the way to the brig...

84
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,661
...save his per diem and ours,
split it and spend it on the way home.

85
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,332
You know what I mean?

86
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,906
Well, let's shag ass!

87
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,904
You're goddamn right!

88
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,411
Okay, Buddusky!
You're the honcho.

89
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,481
Carryall and driver are outside
to take you to the bus.

90
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,709
Here's the keys to the cuffs.

91
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,986
Each of you gets one key.

92
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,722
I want you both to sign
these chits for the pieces.

93
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,994
Here's one clip each.

94
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,161
Now, off the record...

95
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,461
...the old man has a
personal interest in this.

96
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,501
If you fuck up, you know what.

97
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,470
Are you all set, Cochise?

98
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,311
All right, shitbird. On your feet.

99
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,119
They're taking you to Portsmouth.
This is Petty Officer Buddusky.

100
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,253
This is Petty Officer Mulhall.

101
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,111
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,615
You know why they're chasers?

103
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,858
"Chasers," sir?

104
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,861
Do you know why they are
taking you to the brig?

105
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,396
No, sir.

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,434
They're bastards when they want to be,
and they always want to be.

107
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,130
Take my word for it, they aren't
about to take any shit from you.

108
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,071
If they do, they'll get reamed out,
and they know it.

109
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,468
- What?!
- Yes, sir!

110
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,712
All right, he's all yours.

111
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,182
It's colder than witch boob,
ain't it?

112
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,382
Coffee?

113
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,035
Let's make it.

114
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,878
Do you have to go to the head?

115
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,107
No, sir.

116
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,515
Be sure now, Meadows, because
from now on, whenever you go...

117
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,316
...one of us is going
to have to go with you.

118
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,384
I'm not going to kill myself.

119
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,929
Well, I don't think so...

120
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,891
...but you know how it is.

121
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,502
Yes, sir.
I don't need to use the head anyway.

122
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,629
Let's go.

123
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,943
Kill himself, huh?

124
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,122
Back of the bus.

125
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,560
Meadows.

126
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,862
Yes, sir?

127
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,032
I'm removing your handcuffs, Meadows.

128
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,108
Navy feels that on
certain kinds of vehicular transport...

129
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,940
...the prisoner shall have
the use of both his hands...

130
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,242
...to protect his self
in case of an accident.

131
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,851
- Ain't that right, Mulhane?
- That's right.

132
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,061
Where'd you get that candy bar?

133
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,856
I had it with me.

134
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,960
Okay, sailor.

135
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,136
I wasn't accusing you of nothing.

136
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,153
I had them with me!

137
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,918
Hey, man! I ain't said a word.

138
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,667
Take it easy.

139
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,302
You're making Mulhouse hungry.

140
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,959
Meadows?

141
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,336
- You want anything?
- No, sir.

142
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,209
Here, let me have that.

143
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,470
No, wait.

144
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,242
Give me this.

145
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,411
Ten cents.

146
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,082
Could you use a little help with that?

147
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,281
Thank you, young man.

148
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,201
Well, heading north,
huh, Mulehall?

149
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,392
Yeah, man...

150
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,569
...heading north.

151
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,302
My old stomping grounds.

152
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,904
Where you from, Mulehouse?

153
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,268
Hey, man.

154
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,545
It's "Mulhall."

155
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,310
Mulhall.

156
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,110
Understand?

157
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,418
Where you from, Mulhall?

158
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,720
Bogalusa.

159
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,626
Where's that?

160
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,957
Above New Orleans.

161
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,835
Hot down there, ain't it?

162
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,774
Listen, man...

163
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,641
...call me "Mule."

164
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,380
Everybody else does.

165
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,484
- "Mule," okay?
- Okay.

166
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,287
Yes, sir.

167
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,650
They always used to have trouble
with my name too.

168
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,855
Buddusky.

169
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,661
Always wanting to call me "Bad Ass."

170
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,102
"Bad Ass."

171
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,800
I am Bad Ass.

172
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,939
Bad Ass!

173
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,007
Is that true what the Chief said...

174
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,616
...about your getting...

175
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,550
...eight years and a dishonorable
discharge for stealing $40?

176
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,727
I didn't get no $40.

177
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,055
You didn't get it?

178
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,365
They caught me trying
to lift it from the box.

179
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,038
I didn't get it.

180
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,703
Jesus Christ! You mean to tell me
they gave you eight years and a D. D...

181
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,641
...and you didn't even get it?

182
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,510
Boy, they stuck it to him,
didn't they, Mule?

183
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,310
They sure as hell did.

184
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,487
They really stuck it to you, kid.

185
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,623
Stick it in and break it off.

186
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,222
Up your gigi with a wah-wah brush...

187
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,457
...stick it in and break it off.

188
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,397
Leave the kid alone.

189
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,599
I ain't bothering him.

190
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,433
Am I bothering you?

191
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,210
- No, sir.
- I ain't bothering him.

192
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,956
Just trying to be helpful.

193
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,524
So tell me,
how are you going to help him?

194
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,471
I want to ask you a few questions.

195
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,304
You don't have to answer,
but maybe I can help.

196
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,038
Come on!

197
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,622
Now, before this polio thing,
did you have a record?

198
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,492
No. Well, not with the Navy.

199
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:46,153
I got in trouble a couple of times
with the cops before I enlisted.

200
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:47,921
I see.

201
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,567
Was it in the nature
of a serious offense?

202
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,903
For example, was it in the nature
of a felony or a misdemeanor?

203
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,545
Well, it was in the nature
of shoplifting.

204
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,843
But I never was in jail,
if that's what you mean.

205
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,062
You know, Meadows...

206
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,031
...this eight years, it ain't
necessarily eight years.

207
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,074
- It isn't?
- No, it isn't.

208
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,677
They're going to knock two years off
for good behavior.

209
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,280
So that's six years right there.

210
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,805
Really?

211
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,525
That's something.

212
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,855
Ain't it?

213
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
At least we got a long train ride.

214
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,121
Man, I sure love trains!

215
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,861
It beats the shit out of sitting up
in Shit City, don't it?

216
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,471
Man, he didn't have those with him.

217
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,648
No, he didn't.

218
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,487
Why don't you take your coat off...?

219
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,487
Goddamn it! Halt, Meadows!

220
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,421
Halt!

221
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,003
I got him! All right, I got him!

222
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,504
You fucking asshole!

223
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,868
Let me go!

224
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,009
I got him!

225
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,443
I got him! I got him!

226
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,349
All right!
Don't you fucking move!

227
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,464
Sit down.

228
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,374
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,078
I'm sorry...

230
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,976
...for stealing the money.

231
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,149
I swear I didn't want it.

232
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,385
I'm always stealing junk I don't need.

233
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,356
It's all right.
It's all right, Meadows.

234
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,687
Come on. Be a man.

235
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,921
Quart bottles of hair tonic,
model cars...

236
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,530
I couldn't even build a model car.

237
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,562
Just crap...

238
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,466
...you know?

239
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,278
I had money on the books.
You can ask anybody.

240
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,377
But it's gone now...

241
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,050
...because I got forfeiture on pay
and everything...

242
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,815
But I had money.

243
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,389
It's okay, man.

244
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,321
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

245
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,633
The kid's crazy.

246
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,970
Yeah, he ought to see
a fucking psychiatrist.

247
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,803
What about now, man?

248
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,276
We got a nut on our hands right now.
You know what I mean?

249
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,016
We ought to take him off the train
at Washington...

250
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,622
...walk him around a bit
till he gets cooled off.

251
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,593
He's a fucking mess.

252
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,946
Well, the last train
don't take off till 10:30.

253
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,617
Plenty of time for some good chow.

254
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,916
What do you want to eat, Meadows?

255
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,588
I don't know.

256
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,713
- What do you think?
- Looks good.

257
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,217
A little crowded.

258
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,417
What do you think, Meadows?

259
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,016
It's fine.

260
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:17,158
Think they'll melt the cheese on the
burgers? I like the cheese melted.

261
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,395
Do you see a booth in there, Mule?

262
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,968
It's a little crowded.

263
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,544
- Fuck the crowd. I'm hungry.
- Me too.

264
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,714
Maybe the next place, huh?

265
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,177
We're going to miss our train!

266
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,484
Who gives a shit?
So we miss the train.

267
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,556
We got five days!

268
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,749
Come on!

269
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,298
Is your word worth anything?

270
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,802
Sure it is.
As good as the next guy's.

271
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,907
The next guy's a prick!

272
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,807
What I mean is, Meadows...

273
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,541
...you aren't going to try and run away
while we're here in Washington, are you?

274
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,914
Forget about that.
Will you not bang into people...

275
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,986
...and embarrass us like that?

276
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,557
- And not steal anything?
- No, sir.

277
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,186
Goddamn it!

278
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:29,128
Hold still, Meadows.
Son of a bitch. All right.

279
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,465
No question about it.

280
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,663
- It almost gets you high.
- That's entertainment.

281
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,649
- Cheese melted enough for you?
- Sure.

282
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,055
It ain't melted at all.

283
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,622
Send it back!

284
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,588
Send the goddamn thing back.

285
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,524
- You're paying for it.
- It's all right.

286
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,762
Have it the way you want it.

287
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:01,955
Waiter!

288
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,901
Melt cheese for the chief, would you?

289
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,098
Thank you.

290
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,236
See, Meadows?

291
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,541
It's just as easy...

292
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,047
...to have it the way you want it.

293
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,779
Goddamn!

294
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,224
Hey!

295
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,452
Where's these malts at?

296
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,629
See what I mean, Meadows?

297
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,630
That's good.

298
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,069
Better catch that train.

299
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,901
We still got time for a beer.

300
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,976
Now wait a minute, man.

301
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,578
I ain't old enough.

302
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,939
You ain't old enough for what?

303
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,583
For a beer.

304
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,445
Everybody's old enough for a beer.

305
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,213
Ain't that right, Mule?

306
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,924
Well, I'm not.

307
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,120
I know a place right here.
It's nice and quiet.

308
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:10,533
Eight years and a D.D.,
at least we can buy the kid a beer.

309
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,765
Hi, Ed.

310
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,642
I'll take 30 cents worth of beer
in a glass...

311
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,710
...and the same for my shipmates.

312
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,404
Ed don't work here no more.

313
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,176
- Let me see your I.D. 's.
- How come?

314
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,148
Because this kid ain't old enough.

315
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,824
- Listen, pal...
- Listen yourself, pal.

316
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,323
The law says I have to serve him,
but...

317
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,429
I tell you what you do,
Mr. Citizen Bartender.

318
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,225
Take your beers
and ram them up your ass sideways.

319
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,130
- Can you dig it?
- Whoa there, sunshine.

320
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,398
We're going, so you can take your hand
off that horse cock...

321
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,769
...you got stashed under the bar.

322
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,469
How do you know I don't have
something with a little more bark to it?

323
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,414
This redneck's talking about firearms.

324
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,610
I know that you ain't got nothing
but wood under there...

325
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,381
...because I was here
when a certain sailor...

326
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,490
...got it up the side of his head.

327
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,887
What do you think about that, redneck?

328
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,757
The boss'd lose his license
for sure if I serve that kid.

329
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,868
I'll kick your ass around the block
for drill, man.

330
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,265
You try,
and I'll call the shore patrol.

331
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,805
I am the motherfucking shore patrol,
motherfucker!

332
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,275
I am the motherfucking
shore patrol!

333
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,777
Now give him a beer!

334
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,514
- I don't want...
- You're going to have a beer!

335
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,549
I don't feel like one right now.

336
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,551
Come on, man. Come on.

337
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,316
Come on, let's go!
Come on, man.

338
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,632
Man, you are a Bad Ass!

339
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,104
- I am, ain't I?
- Thought you'd blow his head off.

340
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,606
- What?
- You're a Bad Ass.

341
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,108
- A what?
- A Bad Ass!

342
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,904
- A what?!
- A Bad Ass!

343
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,447
You ain't leaving D.C.
till you got a belly full of beer!

344
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,620
Come on, kid! Jesus Christ!

345
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,381
Did you see that cracker asshole?

346
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,218
"The law says that I got to serve him,
but l..."

347
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,190
I thought he'd have a heart attack.

348
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,590
- Scared the shit out of him!
- He was scared!

349
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,129
He was ready to go!

350
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,822
He was gone!

351
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,965
I'd like to drink a toast to Batman...

352
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,327
...Superman...

353
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,573
...and the Human Torch!

354
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,174
What's a Human Torch?

355
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,877
A pure, white, Southern American boy.

356
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,950
The Human Torch...

357
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,711
...when he goes like this...

358
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,680
...he throws a ball of flames
up on you...

359
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,224
...and the fucking building
goes up in an explosion.

360
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,389
And he had a littler guy
that flies around with him.

361
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,103
The best goddamn drink
in the world, isn't it?

362
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,173
Maybe we can sneak it on the train
and finish it off there.

363
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,540
Know what I mean?

364
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,918
The train left
15 minutes ago.

365
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,292
What?

366
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,994
The train left 15 minutes ago.

367
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,601
Well, that's nice! That's fucking nice!

368
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,637
For Christ's sake,
give me a break!

369
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,840
We got five days.
We're on per diem.

370
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,806
I say what we do...

371
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,844
...is check into a hotel...

372
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,183
...hoist up a few more...

373
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:55,189
...have a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow we get on the train.

374
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,721
Sunday.

375
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,037
What the fuck are you laughing at?

376
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,707
Laughing at that silly
son of a bitch over there.

377
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,039
That's what I'm laughing at.

378
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,507
Come on...

379
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,481
...let's get ourselves into...

380
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,923
I got to go to the bathroom!

381
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,285
...a hotel room.

382
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,425
Wonderful idea.

383
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,657
Prisoner...

384
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,664
...on your feet.

385
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,994
Come on.

386
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,976
Cheer up!

387
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,109
Ain't this the life, Mule?

388
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,749
It sure beats freezing your ass
in the alley, don't it?

389
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,450
Beats the hell out of being
back in Shit City too, don't it?

390
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,129
I bet it even beats being
at Portsmouth too.

391
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,169
You know, kid...

392
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,336
...you got a hell of a knack for
killing a conversation.

393
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,878
Just imagine that your hands...

394
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,881
...are the hands of a clock.

395
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:35,656
"A"...

396
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,920
...is twenty to six.

397
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,060
"B"...

398
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,766
...quarter to six.

399
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:43,797
"C"...

400
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,860
...ten to six.

401
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,900
"D"...

402
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,130
...straight up six o'clock...

403
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,568
Come on, man!

404
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,367
We're watching the movie.

405
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,213
Meadows, you want to learn
how to be a signalman?

406
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,042
After the movie, man!

407
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,263
I always tell a new
semaphore personality this...

408
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,995
...to ensure that you send
a more perfect semaphore.

409
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,140
Ready?
I don't expect you to get it perfect.

410
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,403
This just happens to require
a great deal of manual dexterity.

411
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,602
All right.

412
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,367
That was very good, Meadows.

413
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,667
Very good indeed.

414
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,808
You must have a flair for this
sort of thing.

415
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,309
Some people do.

416
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,677
I do, for instance.
I have a flair for this sort of thing.

417
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,888
We got it.

418
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,091
We fucking got it, boys.

419
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:23,956
Here it is.

420
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,059
The truck that...

421
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,329
Very nice catch.

422
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,837
The truck that made your mama's son.

423
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,086
Motherfucking Jesus H. Christ!

424
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,187
You guys mind if I say something?

425
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,635
That guy at the bar...

426
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,001
...why did you get so mad at him?

427
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,498
I don't blame him
not giving me a beer.

428
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,743
Don't you never get mad at nobody?

429
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,883
Yeah, sure. I do. Yeah.

430
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,043
Who do you get mad at?

431
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,215
Well, not at somebody
who's doing their job.

432
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,686
Who then?

433
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,188
Injustice.

434
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,124
Bullshit!

435
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,332
You don't never get mad at nobody.
You're just a pussy.

436
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,095
I do too get mad.

437
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,338
Did you ever get mad at the old man
for what he done to you?

438
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,608
Well, he was just...

439
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,803
Doing his job.

440
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,451
They're going to take eight years
out of your life.

441
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,485
Six years. You said six.

442
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,519
What the fuck difference does it make?
You don't even care about it.

443
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,021
Hey, come on, Bad Ass.

444
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,221
- That don't help him.
- Fuck help!

445
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,228
I mean, fuck fair.
Fuck injustice.

446
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,960
Don't you ever just
want to stomp on someone...

447
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,469
...and bite off their ear,
just to do it?

448
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,904
Just to get it out of your system?

449
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:17,580
Well, I do remember something
I got mad at.

450
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,949
Something when I was in the brig
a marine did.

451
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,152
What happened? Grunts beat you up?

452
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,685
But that didn't get me mad.

453
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,652
Well, goddamn it,
what did get you mad?

454
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,599
This marine guard...

455
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,336
...he asked me if I believed
in Jesus Christ.

456
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,064
I said, "Yeah."

457
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,572
And he said that from now on...

458
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,375
...he was Jesus Christ,
and I shouldn't ever forget it.

459
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,280
What'd you do?

460
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,613
Did you hit him?

461
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,149
Can you imagine that?
That's awful!

462
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,888
Did you coldcock him?

463
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,225
He better hope the chaplain
don't catch him.

464
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,623
Most of the chaplains I know...

465
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,528
...want to stand up on the bridge
with the old man...

466
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,898
...and look through aviator sunglasses.

467
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:21,011
It takes a lot of dedication
to be a Navy chaplain.

468
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,339
Don't take diddlyshit, man!

469
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,512
Come on.

470
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,946
Come on. Come on!
Take a fucking poke at me!

471
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,920
Take a poke at me. Come on.

472
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,888
- Come on.
- What for?

473
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,493
I'll punch you out...

474
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,687
Punch me out, you little prick!

475
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,890
- He won't punch you. You know that.
- I'll make him!

476
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,165
Bad Ass, I like you.

477
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,337
Yeah, I like you.

478
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,434
I'm taking you to jail,
motherfucker.

479
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,075
That ain't your fault.

480
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,018
Come on, Mule!

481
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,483
Come on, goddamn it!

482
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,061
Bad Ass?

483
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,743
Would you teach me the hand signals?

484
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,411
I don't give a shit!

485
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,490
One time...

486
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,094
...when I was down in Long Beach...

487
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,999
...this friend of mine
was looking for me...

488
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,004
...and I was up
on top of the car...

489
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,439
...and I pissed on his head.

490
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,580
Just being crazy, you know what I mean?

491
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,850
Don't you get crazy with me!

492
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,421
I think I'm going to be sick again.

493
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,437
How're we going to work this out?

494
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,600
Work what out?

495
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,444
Who gets what bed!

496
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,447
What the fuck difference does it make?

497
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,756
Well, I can't take...

498
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,186
...this shit indefinitely, man.

499
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,164
What shit?

500
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,757
Somebody's got to make a decision.

501
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,606
There you go.

502
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,051
Just remember...

503
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,986
...rank has it privileges.

504
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,578
Wait a minute.

505
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,686
They make them shit here.

506
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,562
What?

507
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,381
All we got to do is
get off the train at Philly...

508
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,718
...and take a bus to Camden.

509
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,195
What's the matter with that?

510
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,424
It's a couple hours.

511
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,930
He didn't ask to see his mother.

512
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,799
He wouldn't ask...

513
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,597
...to go to the head if he had the runs.

514
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,674
I'm telling you,
he wants to see his mother.

515
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,710
How do we know she's home?

516
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,646
- It's Sunday!
- Sunday?

517
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,377
What's that supposed to mean?

518
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,545
Come on!

519
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,983
You want to go see your mother?

520
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,063
I don't want to get you guys
in trouble or nothing.

521
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,097
You've been so good
to me already.

522
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,005
Let's go and see your mother.

523
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,404
Don't worry about it, Mule.
Know what I mean?

524
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,965
That's Calvin Coolidge Junior High.

525
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,561
I went there.

526
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,705
Where's your old man, Meadows?

527
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,165
Seattle.

528
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,001
Seattle, Washington.

529
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,941
I know where it is. What's he doing?

530
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,041
I think he works in a hardware store.

531
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,747
He's married.

532
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,416
Well, I mean not to my mother,
but to somebody else.

533
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,717
Maybe I even have a half sister.
I think I do.

534
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,424
Camden High!

535
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,125
I graduated from there.

536
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,026
Miss Marabito.

537
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,167
I wonder if she still teaches there.

538
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,410
She made me want to be a veterinarian.

539
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,163
You want to check next door or anything?

540
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,744
Your mom have any friends
in the neighborhood?

541
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:07,179
- Mrs. Esposito.
- Maybe she's over there.

542
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,685
Her car's gone.

543
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,783
What do you want to do?

544
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,489
You want to wait around a little?

545
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,795
We could wait around a little.

546
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,900
I'll go check with Mrs. Esposito.

547
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,775
- Legs really bother you, don't they?
- Sometimes.

548
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,082
You ought to take vitamins.

549
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,383
No, take vitamins. Seriously, man.

550
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,452
Go to the dispensary.

551
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,185
- What's wrong?
- We let him go by himself!

552
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,590
He could get away!

553
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,561
Don't get excited.
That kid ain't going nowhere.

554
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,200
What makes you so sure?

555
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,335
Well, you know him.

556
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,705
Jesus Christ!

557
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,571
Then where is he?

558
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,274
Where is he?

559
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,041
There.

560
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:21,422
Don't get your balls in an uproar.
Meadows ain't going nowhere without us.

561
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,429
Let me tell you something
about a kid like Meadows.

562
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,589
He's the kind of guy,
he's going to the brig...

563
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,291
...and secretly he's probably glad.

564
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:37,538
On the outside, too many things
can happen to him, all of it bad.

565
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,403
This way, the worse part's
already happening.

566
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,135
He's probably glad.

567
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,203
Glad.

568
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,342
If you ain't right...

569
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,019
...you better be quick,
because I ain't.

570
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,877
She went for the day.

571
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:53,812
Sunday!

572
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,488
You want to go in and wait awhile?

573
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,687
What for?

574
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,797
Well, she might come home early.

575
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:08,894
No, thanks.

576
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,765
Well, at least you could sit
in your own house.

577
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,341
Maybe we can get in.

578
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,538
I don't know what
I would've said to her anyway.

579
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,554
You know what Meadows ought to do?

580
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,847
He ought to get his old lady
to write her congressman.

581
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:07,229
She can write letters to her congressman
till she owns the fucking post office!

582
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,262
It don't mean diddlyshit!

583
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,162
Look, either we let him go
or he lives with it.

584
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,099
And we ain't about to let him go.
Understand?

585
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,126
Now look what you made him do.

586
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,730
- What I made him do?
- Yeah.

587
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,595
- Where you going?
- To the head, okay?

588
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,301
If that don't make you just
want to shit in your flat hat, man.

589
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:55,000
Look what you went... Look what you...
I hope you're satisfied!

590
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,204
You're the one insisted
we take him to see his mother!

591
00:46:58,415 --> 00:46:59,973
I hate this detail.

592
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:03,210
I hate this fucking
chicken-shit detail!

593
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:20,626
I love the fucking detail, I suppose.
What am I supposed to do?

594
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,271
I'm just trying to...

595
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,315
Meadows?

596
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,681
Meadows, open up!

597
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,480
Meadows, you all right?

598
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,254
You all right?

599
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,927
I consider myself in jeopardy with you.
Understand?

600
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,466
In jeopardy.

601
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:57,064
This ain't no farewell party,
and he ain't retiring.

602
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,366
Understand?

603
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,203
He's a prisoner, and
we're taking him to jail.

604
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,572
You have a tendency to forget that.

605
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,513
You're a menace, man!

606
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,617
You ain't no simple shit.
You're a motherfucking menace!

607
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,721
From now on, MAA can go
piss up a rope. You ain't no honcho!

608
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,949
I don't want to hear more of
this psychology jive!

609
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,458
No more turning his head around
to prove what a big man you are!

610
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,221
You're a lifer like me!

611
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,399
Navy's the best thing
ever happened to me.

612
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,899
I don't want you to fuck me up.
You understand?

613
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,701
- Buddusky?
- I hear you.

614
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,968
Do you agree?

615
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:38,110
I was just trying to show him
a good time. Know what I mean?

616
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,341
He can't have a good time.
It ain't in him.

617
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,546
- He had a good time in Washington.
- All right.

618
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,747
He had a good time in Washington.

619
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,950
Think that'll make it any
easier to pull his eight years?

620
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,493
It won't. It'll make it harder.

621
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,831
So what.

622
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,130
You know what I mean?

623
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,811
Your attention, please.

624
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:19,250
Amtrak 211 for Chicago, boarding...

625
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,390
...in 10 minutes at gate three.

626
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,721
Amtrak 211 for Chicago...

627
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,653
...boarding at gate three.

628
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,588
We go this way.

629
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,136
The train for Boston leaves
in two hours.

630
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,370
We don't leave the building until then.
Understand?

631
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,174
You got a quarter?

632
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,394
Where are you going?

633
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:39,991
Head.

634
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,130
All right?

635
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,168
Sailor looks like he's lost something.

636
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,111
Probably have trouble finding it
with those 13 buttons.

637
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:32,480
If I was a Marine, I wouldn't
have to fuck with no 13 buttons.

638
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,324
I'd just take my hat off.

639
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,306
Hi, boys.

640
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,844
- I call it karate!
- I call it motherfucker!

641
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,579
What's going on here?

642
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,256
Come on...

643
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,222
Wipe your nose, will you, kid?

644
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,261
He fought like a champ, though,
didn't he? Jesus.

645
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,865
Goddamn, that was great.

646
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,696
It was great, wasn't it?

647
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,063
It was great. Admit it!
Give me a little of this!

648
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,767
Give me just because
they call me Shine in here.

649
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,911
I got your greatness.

650
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,446
Meadows, over here...

651
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:11,579
...they have the finest Italian sausage
sandwiches in the world...

652
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,119
...and I'm buying.

653
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:19,584
Goddamn...

654
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,694
I ask you, man.

655
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:26,063
Where else in the world can you get
a sandwich like this?

656
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,166
And for 50 cents!

657
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,306
I never ate anything so good.

658
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,644
I ain't shitting you.

659
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:38,506
I'm going to have to have
another one of these.

660
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,684
I'd like a little more onions.

661
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,719
- Little more? There's some.
- How about some of these?

662
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,383
You got it.

663
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,924
We got to figure out what to do.

664
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:58,893
And we will.

665
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,330
We will.

666
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,597
Only we're going to do it
over a bottle of Heineken's.

667
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,907
What's Heineken's?

668
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,741
The finest beer in the world, kid.

669
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,277
President Kennedy used to drink it.

670
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,279
Goddamned Dutch soup is about all...

671
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,253
Double up, there.

672
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,120
Want to get in this
or do you want to keep quiet?

673
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,090
All right, how'd you do?

674
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:35,333
Help me get Buddusky out.
He's betting with our travel money.

675
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,939
Hope this won't go in the toilet.

676
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,801
He's losing too.

677
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,937
All right, gentlemen.

678
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,481
It's you and me, one on one.

679
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:48,651
Easy money, eh?

680
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,218
What do you think?
Here's to you.

681
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,285
Cheers.

682
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,820
You want the honors?

683
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,116
You go ahead.

684
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,350
Don't worry about a thing.

685
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,287
I'm hustling this guy, understand?
I got him right where I want him.

686
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,262
Maybe he's hustling you.

687
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,404
Maybe he is, but this isn't the time
to argue about it...

688
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:14,065
...because if I don't win,
we don't leave New York.

689
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,767
Fourteen years.

690
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,310
Fourteen motherfucking years.

691
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,883
This'll make him go crazy.

692
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,125
The man is going to hustle me,
with glasses.

693
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,721
Fifty-four...

694
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:36,662
...sixty-one...

695
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,960
...sixty-three dollars.
That's $21...

696
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,159
...apiece.

697
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:42,731
Apiece?

698
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,973
Sure, we're partners, ain't we?

699
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,506
Yeah, Bad Ass.

700
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:51,409
Then take your fucking 21 bucks and
don't give me such a hard time.

701
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,982
For you, back here.
Right here.

702
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,984
Bravo, Yankee. Bravo, Yankee.

703
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,314
You're damn right.

704
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:01,917
"Dead man," in Russian.

705
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,156
That was damn good, kid.

706
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,559
You ought to put in for signalman.

707
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:27,677
What's that?

708
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,587
I don't know. I hear it too.

709
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,748
What the hell is an "Indiana dog"?

710
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,755
Goddamn, that's the goddamnedest thing
I ever heard!

711
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,432
- What is that?
- Hey, let's go take a look.

712
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,731
I mean, what the hell?
Eight years and a D.D.

713
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,096
What are we going to do?

714
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,828
Take off your shoes.

715
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:27,707
Must be one of them Jap joints
where we got to take off our shoes.

716
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,102
What are they saying?

717
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,478
Hold it down.

718
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,610
I think we're in a church.

719
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,356
Good evening.

720
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,719
Good evening!

721
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,427
Welcome to Nichiren Shoshu meeting.

722
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,396
Tonight throughout the city there
are hundreds of meetings like this.

723
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:28,037
Where people learn about
Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and Gohonzon.

724
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,303
What's a Gohonzon?

725
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,241
I'll tell you about it later.

726
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,237
We're going to do that
through the experiences we've had.

727
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,007
Who's had an experience?

728
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,375
Good evening!

729
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,714
When I first started chanting...

730
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:50,120
...I wanted to find a girl
that I could relate to...

731
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,463
She took me to a meeting like this.

732
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,861
I remember thinking,
"These people are out of their minds!"

733
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:02,299
But later we went to her apartment,
and I tried her Gohonzon.

734
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,530
Come on, what's a Gohonzon?

735
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,572
I'll tell you later.

736
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,611
And now I really love the clarinet...

737
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:14,112
...and I can't remember why
I wanted a flute in the first place.

738
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,949
There's a sun
shining in your heart

739
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,986
There's a song
waiting to be sung

740
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,124
There's a dream
longing to be free

741
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,830
In your life
happiness you'll see

742
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,760
Bring it out
Your shining light

743
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,397
You can change this world
of trouble and strife

744
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:43,078
Why does all of this
make me feel so fucking bad?

745
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:48,211
Bring it out now
Bring it out now

746
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,716
Bring it out now,
hey!

747
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,919
A bunch of candy-asses.

748
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,620
Ever hear such happy horseshit?

749
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,831
That one guy was a big homo, huh?

750
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,861
Yeah, but you guys,
he sure was a happy homo.

751
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:22,317
If you're going to chant, let's figure
out what you're going to chant for.

752
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,913
How about I get sprung from Portsmouth?

753
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,392
Let's see if it works.

754
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,994
Then you can chant
for something really big.

755
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:42,964
Yeah, like how's about
the three of us get laid, huh?

756
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,771
Should you chant
for something like that?

757
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,237
Why the fuck not?

758
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,933
Well, it's a religion!

759
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,237
You're too good to believe!

760
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,485
"Yodeling in the canyon."

761
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:05,894
Ever heard of it?

762
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,201
You ever done that before?

763
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,396
Not exactly, no.

764
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:25,840
Are they really doing that
when they take that picture?

765
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:34,852
Well, kid, there's more things in this
life than you can possibly imagine.

766
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,426
I knew a whore once in Wilmington.

767
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,427
She had a...

768
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,959
...glass eye.

769
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,698
She used to take it out
and wink people off for a dollar.

770
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,570
Really?

771
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,219
There's still some room for your rank.
You want it?

772
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,028
No, I don't think so.

773
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,566
Yeah, come on, kid.
It's time you made your rate.

774
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,668
They busted me to E-1.
You know that.

775
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:27,270
Listen, right now
we're a navy of three.

776
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,010
Pick a rate. Any rate.

777
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,477
I can make you anything I want to
because I'm the honcho.

778
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,211
What'll it be?

779
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,427
Chief Signalman?

780
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,334
Okay, partner.

781
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,734
L. Meadows, S.M.C.

782
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:08,214
Show me some moves, kid!

783
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,177
Look, he don't know what to do.

784
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,820
He don't know!

785
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,916
He looks like a
goddamn big penguin, don't he?

786
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:22,159
Watch out for children!

787
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,992
- Hey, look...
- Cruise right through them!

788
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,169
Give them the spinner, kid!

789
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,968
He sure is having a good time.

790
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,771
Sure is. And you said
it wasn't in him.

791
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,138
All right.

792
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,078
Watch out for the Indian, kid!

793
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,512
Don't crush somebody.

794
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,523
Look at the size of this guy
on roller skates.

795
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,999
I was wondering if we're done.

796
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,467
It worked!

797
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,937
I chanted to stay on my feet and I did.
It worked.

798
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,920
Lighten up, will you, Meadows? Jesus!

799
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,204
You're chanting!

800
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,347
I'm a member of Nichiren Shoshu.
My name's Donna.

801
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,444
How do you do?

802
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:26,553
Hello.

803
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,088
What are you chanting for?

804
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:36,258
Go ahead, Meadows.
Tell her what you're chanting for.

805
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:37,963
A girl?

806
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,932
That's okay.
You can chant for anything.

807
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:47,073
- What's your name?
- Meadows.

808
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,744
- Your first name.
- Larry.

809
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,150
Why don't you come over
and meet some people?

810
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,910
Just for a minute.

811
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,112
Come on. We'll be right back.

812
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:13,530
If this guy gets pussy out of this,
I'm gonna eat my fucking flat hat.

813
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,465
I'm going
to start chanting too.

814
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,812
Hey, you guys? Drop your socks and grab
your cocks. We're going to a party.

815
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:36,147
This could be the big one,
eh, Meadows?

816
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,921
You just moved in?

817
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:42,325
Not too long ago. I think I
might move out again too.

818
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,863
- It's a problem, finding a place.
- This is a nice party.

819
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,398
Might as well be at a fucking bus stop.

820
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,275
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

821
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,776
Hey, I'm telling you, Mule,
we got it made.

822
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,778
All we got to do is get rid of
that creep there...

823
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,383
...and we got these three chicks
to ourselves.

824
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,019
We have, huh?

825
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,755
Yeah. Why not?

826
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:12,790
Because those three chicks would rather
fuck each other than us, that's why not.

827
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:15,623
There's nothing...

828
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,925
...like being on the sea...

829
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,462
...even in the Navy.

830
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,299
Being on the bridge...

831
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,236
...doing a man's job...

832
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:30,776
That's great.

833
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,208
Where you going?

834
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:37,441
I'm not putting down the government.
I just want him to tell me one thing.

835
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,451
There must be one thing
you don't like about Nixon.

836
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,724
You sure have a lot of records.

837
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,854
I get most of them free.
I work in the business.

838
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,158
What business?

839
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,407
- I smoked grass.
- Huh?

840
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,475
I smoked grass, Bad Ass.

841
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:09,511
I'm giving this girl such a line
of horseshit. It is unbelievable!

842
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:13,355
She loves it. She loves it!

843
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,748
Doing a man's job...

844
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:21,895
...talking to ships...

845
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,266
...across miles and miles...

846
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,504
...of liquid real estate.

847
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,843
Ooh, big time.

848
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,116
How come you don't
see more black officers?

849
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:55,854
Because you need a recommendation
from a white man, usually.

850
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,795
- How can you stay...
- Nothing Nixon says disturbs you?

851
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,628
Just tell me, is that right?

852
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,667
Henry, you're driving me crazy.

853
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:05,067
You guys on leave, or what?

854
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,773
"Liberty," you mean.

855
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,238
Liberty.

856
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:12,573
No.

857
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:22,117
Well, what are you guys doing anyway?

858
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,226
They're taking me to jail.

859
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:35,203
I've seen things.
Seen men do things that...

860
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:41,508
...I wouldn't even begin to tell you
at a time like this, my fair darling.

861
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,411
- I can see what it's done for you.
- Can you?

862
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,277
That's wonderful.

863
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:47,972
Must be the uniform.

864
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:54,988
- They are cute, aren't they?
- Oh, yeah.

865
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,787
I like the way...
You know what I like about it?

866
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,888
One of my favorite things
about this uniform...

867
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:04,497
...is the way
it makes your dick look.

868
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:08,366
How did you feel about
going to Vietnam?

869
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,469
The man says, "Go."
I got to do what the man says.

870
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:21,639
We're living in this man's world,
ain't we?

871
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,054
Oh, wow!

872
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:29,853
Eight years.

873
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,419
I get two off.

874
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,225
So it's only six.

875
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,492
Why don't you get away?

876
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:46,833
Get away?

877
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,110
To Canada.

878
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,175
I've got this friend, George Lucido!

879
01:10:56,185 --> 01:11:00,645
He Shakabukued me!
He's a group chief in Toronto.

880
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:02,990
I'll give you his number.

881
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:08,924
I couldn't.

882
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,359
Why not?

883
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,294
It would be their ass.

884
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,229
What do you owe them?

885
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,971
They're my best friends, Donna.

886
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:23,942
Come on.

887
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,438
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

888
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,831
You know what I mean?

889
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,892
What?

890
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,000
It's up to you...

891
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,471
...but I'm going to chant for you.

892
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,940
I'm going to chant for you
with my whole heart.

893
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:45,725
Chant?

894
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,394
Yes...

895
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,190
...that you get away.

896
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:13,816
Bad Ass?

897
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:18,725
What the fuck is it now, Meadows?

898
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:26,428
If you're Catholic, do you think
it's sacrilegious to chant?

899
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:29,160
- Did it get you laid?
- No.

900
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:33,866
Then, Meadows, what the fuck do you
want to go on chanting for?

901
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:38,844
Chant your ass off, kid.
But any pussy you get in this world...

902
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:41,709
...you have to pay for,
one way or another.

903
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,282
Hallelujah!

904
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,158
When do we get to Boston?

905
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,462
Two hours.

906
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,895
What time we got to be in Portsmouth?

907
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:07,137
Not after 1800 tomorrow.

908
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,245
Well, what do you think?

909
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,175
- I think we ought to get the kid laid.
- Laid?

910
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,555
Ever heard of it?

911
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,623
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir?

912
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,024
I asked for my eggs over easy.

913
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:30,528
They are over easy, sir.

914
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,063
No, they're not.

915
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,139
I'm learning. I'm learning.

916
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,712
Oh, Jesus!

917
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,021
You're taking the kid
to the cathouse, ain't you?

918
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,726
Yeah. Come on, Mule.

919
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:02,260
He's 18 years old.
He ain't never been fucked.

920
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:06,159
Next chance he gets,
he's going to be 26.

921
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,002
He might not want any by then.

922
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,768
You mean right now?
Just go ahead and do it?

923
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,574
No. Not this exact minute.

924
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,517
Later on tonight.

925
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,887
I think I would.

926
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:35,028
- Yeah, get the old ashes hauled.
- "Ashes hauled"?

927
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,901
- What are we doing?
- Huh?

928
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:46,905
- What are we doing?
- Looking for a certain guy.

929
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,050
Here, here, here.
This one right here.

930
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,249
How're they treating you, partner?

931
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,051
Fine, sailor. Where to?

932
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,161
Just down the road.

933
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,395
Let me tell you
what we really want.

934
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,333
You look honest.
I think I can trust you.

935
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,015
We're in transit,
the three of us, see, and...

936
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,585
We could use
the services of a decent whorehouse.

937
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:31,753
Know what I mean?

938
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,345
One that don't hate Gls.

939
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:46,093
Sizable tip in it for you.

940
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,328
Save the tip. I get it
at the other end.

941
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,103
Hey, thanks a lot.

942
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,432
I've been in transit a few times too.

943
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:56,804
I'm an old minesweep sailor myself.

944
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:00,573
Oh, yeah? You're a swabbie?
I thought you was. I did.

945
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:03,876
I thought he was a swabbie.
Minesweep, eh?

946
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:48,761
Hi, boys.

947
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,123
I'm Millie.

948
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:53,264
- Hi, Millie.
- Come on in.

949
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:56,335
- Thank you.
- The Navy's always welcome here.

950
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:12,777
Too late for Captain Kangaroo, ladies?

951
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,415
Here, let me tell you how it is, Mil.

952
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:22,063
We got a friend we'd like to do
a favor for. He's going on a trip.

953
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,562
- Just him?
- Just him, yeah.

954
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,996
What kind of party you after?

955
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,634
Well, it's his party.

956
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:32,704
You name it, sailor.

957
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,067
Okay, sailor.
Take your pick.

958
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,044
Pick a winner, kid.

959
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:34,326
Make it a good one, honey.
It's got to last a long time.

960
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,663
Sure, honey. Anything you say.

961
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:38,305
You know what I mean?

962
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,604
Kid, you picked a real winner.

963
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,786
You boys just make
yourselves comfortable.

964
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,226
Goddamn! He picked the same one
I would have.

965
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,485
She's a cute little thing, isn't she?

966
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,432
Your coat, honey.

967
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:16,469
Come over here by the sink.
Let me check you out.

968
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,186
You're not going to have
a bit of trouble.

969
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,213
Jesus Christ!

970
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,551
Well, that's what I call "quick."

971
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:07,886
Look, those are the rules. Doesn't
matter if it's 10 hours or 10 seconds.

972
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:11,557
Okay, tootsie. We'll stake him
to another shot.

973
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:14,763
I'm sorry.

974
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:23,434
You want to try it again, kid?

975
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,172
Yeah.

976
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,376
Okay, honey.

977
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:32,815
Don't worry, kid.
Plenty more where that came from.

978
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,229
You got all night, kid.

979
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:53,034
You ever been married?

980
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:56,302
Not so you'd notice.

981
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,143
Once.

982
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,279
A little girl in Torrance.

983
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:08,213
Know where that is?

984
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:14,094
It's near San Pedro, on the way
to Terminal Island, you know?

985
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,565
Dottie Brown.

986
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:24,270
She had great tits and wore
angora sweaters all the time.

987
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:29,507
She wanted me to go to trade school
and become a TV repairman.

988
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,608
Drive around all that smog and shit...

989
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:37,581
...fixing TVs out of the back
of a VW bus.

990
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:42,686
I just couldn't do it.

991
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,194
You ever been married?

992
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,863
I still support my mama.

993
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,365
She can't brag enough about me.

994
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:03,374
Tells everybody all the places I go,
how many men are under me...

995
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:05,239
...all that shit.

996
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,544
Yeah, man...

997
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:14,822
...I don't know what I would've done
without the Navy.

998
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:21,790
I guess we're just a couple of lifers.

999
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,699
How was...

1000
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,571
How was what, honey?

1001
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:48,684
Well, you got off to a shaky start.

1002
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,188
After that, you took to it
like a duck to water.

1003
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:10,945
I don't know if I have
enough money to go again...

1004
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:15,579
...but I'll pay you what I have...

1005
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:18,918
...just to look at you.

1006
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:21,953
Just to what?

1007
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:29,256
Look at you.

1008
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:37,532
Guess you haven't seen many girls
with their clothes off, have you?

1009
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:46,211
Well, let me tell you.
I've got a good body.

1010
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,680
Not great, but pretty good.

1011
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:18,102
It's beautiful.

1012
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,251
What did she say again?

1013
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,552
"Let me check you out, honey."

1014
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,626
I swear to God.

1015
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:39,766
Like I was in a gas station
and she was checking the oil.

1016
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,596
- And then...
- Then we know what happened.

1017
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,830
Yeah, but after. After...

1018
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:52,369
Well, maybe it was an act for her.

1019
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,680
I mean, I know she was a whore...

1020
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,884
...but I think she liked me.

1021
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:03,051
They got feelings just like
everybody else, kid. She probably did.

1022
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:06,318
Well, it was real for me.

1023
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:08,028
That's what counts.

1024
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:25,011
Welcome to the wonderful world
of pussy, kid. The sink's yours.

1025
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,917
We don't have to be there till 1800.

1026
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:42,721
It takes an hour and a half
to get to Portsmouth.

1027
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,829
We could go see a movie or two.

1028
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,130
We can get us a couple of six-packs.

1029
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:53,466
Shit, we can even go back
to the cathouse if you want to.

1030
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:58,906
No.

1031
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,581
I already did everything one time.

1032
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,417
That makes that one time stick out.
You know what I mean?

1033
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:18,397
- It sure is a shit day.
- Ain't it the truth.

1034
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,192
Yeah, it is.

1035
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:24,201
If it was summer, we could maybe
have a picnic.

1036
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:33,513
Son of a bitch!

1037
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:38,941
Thank you.

1038
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:49,858
This wood's too fucking green, man.
It ain't going to burn.

1039
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:51,420
Wet wood.

1040
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,795
Wait a minute!

1041
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:25,258
- What are you looking for?
- Buns.

1042
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,391
I forgot them.

1043
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:30,034
- You forgot the buns?
- Yeah.

1044
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,069
How can you eat a hot dog
without a bun?

1045
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:36,242
- It's not a hot dog without...
- Don't eat the fucking thing, then!

1046
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,038
Shit!

1047
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,411
It ain't bad.

1048
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:55,123
Shit!

1049
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:02,695
- I don't want no fucking hot dogs.
- He don't eat them without buns.

1050
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,628
It's kind of like being at sea.

1051
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:34,458
I was on a weather ship once...

1052
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,600
...off of Greenland.

1053
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,064
Right in the middle of winter.

1054
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:41,906
How was it?

1055
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:45,438
I like being at sea.

1056
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:57,917
Kid's come a long way
in the last few days, ain't he?

1057
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:27,345
Let's get this over with.

1058
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,283
He don't stand a chance
in Portsmouth, you know.

1059
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,092
You know that, don't you?

1060
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:10,788
Goddamn grunts kicking the shit
out of him for eight years.

1061
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:17,430
He don't stand a chance.

1062
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:20,099
I don't want to hear about it.

1063
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:26,703
"Maggot" this. "Maggot" that.

1064
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,217
Marines are really assholes,
you know that?

1065
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:38,051
It takes a certain kind of a sadistic
temperament to be a Marine.

1066
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:58,967
What the fuck's he doing?

1067
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:02,637
Hey, Meadows!

1068
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:13,752
What's he doing?

1069
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:17,621
"Bravo...

1070
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:19,358
...Yankee...

1071
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,427
...Bravo, Yankee.
Bye-bye. End of the word."

1072
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,463
Hey, this son of a bitch
is running away!

1073
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:27,625
Halt, you son of a bitch!

1074
01:33:39,814 --> 01:33:42,647
Halt! You motherfucker!

1075
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,310
Buddusky, don't!

1076
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:45,348
Don't!

1077
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:51,491
Goddamn, I lost my fucking shoe!

1078
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:11,376
Let me go!

1079
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:13,844
Buddusky, don't!

1080
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:16,346
Let me go, you bastard!

1081
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:36,929
Please let me go!

1082
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:55,348
I lost my fucking shoe!

1083
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:50,893
Baker, Mooney, prisoner from Norfolk,
on the double!

1084
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:37,516
Where'd you get the idea
that wearing an armband...

1085
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:40,380
...and a sidearm entitles you
to abuse a prisoner?

1086
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,389
They teach you that in the Navy?

1087
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,452
Or was that your idea of a good time?

1088
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:49,827
I guess.

1089
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,260
You guess what, sailor?

1090
01:37:55,569 --> 01:37:57,935
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1091
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,768
Nothing, sir.

1092
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:06,441
- Did the prisoner offer any resistance?
- No, sir.

1093
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:10,606
Did he try to escape?

1094
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:15,678
Not exactly.

1095
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:22,427
That's a little vague.
Either he did or didn't. Which is it?

1096
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,026
Don't look at him
for the answer. Which is it?

1097
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,906
- He didn't.
- He didn't what?

1098
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:37,803
He didn't try to escape.

1099
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:43,782
He didn't try to escape, "sir."

1100
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,182
He didn't try to escape, sir.

1101
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:02,425
You haven't left yet.

1102
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:04,230
Sir?

1103
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:08,708
Your orders weren't endorsed. According
to this, you're still in Norfolk.

1104
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:10,501
Well, we're standing here.

1105
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:11,871
It's not our fault.

1106
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:13,239
You haven't left yet.

1107
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:16,041
- You haven't left!
- That's not our fault!

1108
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,678
Look, sir. We both got
a lot of time in.

1109
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:21,544
What's that supposed to mean?

1110
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:25,388
Too much time to be hard-ass
because some dude in Norfolk...

1111
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:27,719
...forgot to endorse our orders.

1112
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:32,156
You're asking for trouble.

1113
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:34,397
I'm asking to see the XO.

1114
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:36,898
Deep trouble!

1115
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:39,204
No.

1116
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:43,939
We ain't about to say
anything else until we see the XO.

1117
01:40:09,737 --> 01:40:11,261
Get the hell out of here.

1118
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:26,145
You're supposed to pull a few copies.

1119
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,464
Goddamn grunts!

1120
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:40,992
Think they can get away with anything!

1121
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:44,335
Telling me how to do my job.
I know my job.

1122
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:48,702
I know my goddamn job better than
anybody else in the goddamn Navy!

1123
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:52,777
We really told him though, didn't we?

1124
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,811
Trying to ream our ass...

1125
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:58,416
...and he don't even have sense
to pull a few goddamn copies!

1126
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:00,780
Bunch of candy-asses!

1127
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:05,321
I hate this motherfucking,
