00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,920
"Shaolin Monastery"

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,400
One

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Two

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,040
Stop!

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,440
Brother Zhi Shan,
the Abbot would like to see you

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,040
Greetings to Abbot

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,040
Zhi Shan, you've been a monk
since you were a kid

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,200
How long have you been in this monastery?

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
I came here since I was six,
it's been twenty years

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,240
For years, monks in this monastery

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,200
have practised martial art to resist Qing

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
but we are short of weapons

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,280
The Qings forbid
the possession of weapons by people

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,280
that's why we have to make them ourselves

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm now ordering you to
go to the Wen Shu Temple

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,280
Go and meet Priest Wu Chen

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,600
to get the blueprints of gunmaking

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,280
and steelwelding

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
Do you think you can manage this task?

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,880
I'll do my best

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,560
Good

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Wu Chen was an exMing general

29
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,240
He's very good at kung fu

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,480
You can stay and learn from him

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,040
I will!

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,000
Brother Zhi Shan

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,400
We students from Shaolin
aren't allowed to leave freely

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,360
This time Abbot ordered you
to the Er Mei Mount

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,560
You're lucky to have the chance
to move around

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
to get some experience

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,080
People in the martial arts world
are crafty

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,840
There are pitfalls everywhere,
you must be very careful

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,960
Brother Fei Wen is right

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,880
but man is by nature kind

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,640
Otherwise,

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,080
Buddha wouldn't have come to save us

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,240
Do you have Abbot's letter with you?

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,480
Yes!

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,880
Brother, please!

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Take care

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,000
Goodbye

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,840
Master, haven't seen you around here
at Mt. Er Mei

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,440
May I ask where you are from
and where you're headed?

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,040
I am from Shaolin Monastery at Song Shan

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,160
and have to go to Wen Shu Temple
to see Priest Wu Chen

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,960
What a coincidence.
Wu Chen happens to be my uncle

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,040
Across this mountain is the Wen Shu Temple

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,200
Thank you Madam! Please!

55
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,560
I don't know you,
and this path is precarious

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,280
I must be on my guard
against your sudden attacks

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,000
I know abbot's requirements

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,560
The weapons drawings he wants

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,840
would take at least 3 months to compile

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,440
You stay here first.
I'll get it done as soon as I can

61
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,760
Thank you!

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,880
What else did the abbot want you to do?

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,040
He said you excel at martial arts

64
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,400
and wants me to learn from you

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
That's laudable

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
I'll take you as my student

67
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,000
Teacher, my respects!

68
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,360
Good!

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,920
Dao de

70
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,640
Yes

71
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,240
Take Zhi Shan to the guest room

72
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
Yes!

73
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Since the Shaolin Monastery
is dedicated to

74
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,240
expel the Manchurians

75
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
its kung fu must be extraordinary!

76
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,040
Everyone in the monastery
is busy practising

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,280
How many years have you practised?

78
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,120
I joined at six and am twenty six now

79
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,320
So you have practised for twenty years

80
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,080
You must be peerless

81
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,560
May I venture to match blows with you?

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,280
Brother Feng, why did you

83
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,760
use such a fatal maneuver?

84
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
That's what I've learnt

85
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,840
You'll recover after a month's rest

86
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,480
I admit I've not mastered kung fu

87
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,840
Some day

88
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
I'll meet him again

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,760
Brother, it's your own fault

90
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,320
I saw you used a devastating technique
to attack him

91
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,760
He hurt you only out of selfdefense

92
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,040
It wasn't intentional, please excuse me

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
Zhi Shan, don't blame yourself

94
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,680
This is my younger brother Bai Mei

95
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
whojust returned from his tour

96
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,800
He got some Shaolin news from the court

97
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,480
which may interest you

98
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,920
The Court has found out about Shaolin

99
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,680
secretly indulging in martial arts

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,280
and making weapons

101
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,800
Those from Shaolin
have been classified as rebels

102
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,200
and yet you have retained
a Shaolin monk here

103
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,480
I don't think it's right

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,560
What do you mean?

105
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,560
Shaolin is committed to expel Manchurians

106
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,760
That is a heroic act

107
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,320
we should all contribute our part

108
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,000
If you want to be friends with rebels

109
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,160
I have nothing to say

110
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,680
Brother, to each his own

111
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,680
From this day we go separate ways

112
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
There must be some truth in this news

113
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,240
from brother Bai Mei

114
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,880
I'll inform Shaolin Monastery

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,320
For the meantime
concentrate on your kung fu

116
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
Yes!

117
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,960
You have practised kung fu at Shaolin
for years

118
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,920
what are your specialties?

119
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,400
DragonVanquishing Palm

120
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
Iron head

121
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
And SingleFinger Meditation

122
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,360
You have been practising
hard style kung fu

123
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,680
but now you should
work on your inner powers;

124
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,480
This transcends all kung fu

125
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,000
For Chopping, exhale from the abdomen

126
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,800
Strength is exercised from the palm

127
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
Once you master it

128
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,640
you can break the jars

129
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
For Iron Head,
practise neck strength first

130
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,160
Exhale and focus all strength
towards the head

131
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,160
Guang Yuan

132
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
Yes!

133
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,000
Dan Tian Gang

134
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Yes!

135
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,840
Yue Ying Qi

136
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,360
Yes!

137
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,280
Monks in the Shaolin Monastery
are conspiring to rebel

138
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
What have you found out about it?

139
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,000
We have sent someone inside,
posing as workers

140
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,000
it's confirmed they are practising
kung fu in secret

141
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,880
and have treacherous intentions

142
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
Why haven't you wiped them out?

143
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
There are underground secret chambers

144
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,320
We must not arouse their suspicion

145
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,280
I order you to wipe them out in 3 months

146
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,440
failing which you'll be beheaded

147
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,240
Troops of He Nan are at your disposal

148
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Yes

149
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm grateful for your instructions

150
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,360
in this half year, sir

151
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,640
You've assimilated everything well

152
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,520
and have made remarkable progress

153
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,080
Keep on practising after your return

154
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,080
Yes!

155
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,440
Keep well the

156
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,840
weapons drawing

157
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,040
Yes. Please go back, I'll take your leave

158
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Zhi Shan must pass here

159
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,640
on his way to Shaolin today

160
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,040
When he does so, I'll teach him a lesson

161
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,800
Brother Zhi Shan is a gentleman

162
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,680
it's your fault too that day

163
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,840
Why are you doing this?

164
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,240
I don't want the master to blame us

165
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
Go away if you're afraid

166
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,760
Uncle Bai Mei has said

167
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,240
we are free to kill Zhi Shan

168
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,760
What a coincidence we meet here

169
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,360
Brother Feng, I am returning to Shaolin

170
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
So you have learnt our Er Mei kung fu

171
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,280
and want to return to Shaolin to show off

172
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,440
Why do you say this?

173
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,120
Teacher said learning kung fu
is just for defense

174
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,520
this is the only purpose

175
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
I want to see if you could defend yourself

176
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,280
Shaolin Monastery is full of
secret tunnels and cells

177
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,480
you've sketched it well

178
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
Thank you, Mr Li

179
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,200
We have two spies staying in Shaolin

180
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,080
for half a year

181
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,080
Until today we've found out
the layout of the monastery

182
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,440
I hear their rules are strict

183
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,640
and monks are not allowed to leave

184
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,080
Yes, I was instructed to buy
foodstuff today

185
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,840
that's why I could come here

186
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,560
Mr Li

187
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,920
Yes!

188
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,640
Tell them to prepare dynamite

189
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,320
and hide it all inside the food

190
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,120
Let them bring back to the Monastery

191
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Yes!

192
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,760
Pick out 400 elite for this duty

193
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,120
after eradicating Shaolin,
they'll be promoted

194
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,320
Yes!

195
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,640
Return to Shaolin first to help us there

196
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,320
Go back, hurry!

197
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Yes

198
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,640
Some men are here

199
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
May I ask why are you here

200
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,080
at this late hour?

201
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,080
By the order of His Majesty

202
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
Tibet's Lama is here,

203
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,280
ask your abbot to welcome him

204
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,240
Since Bodhidharma travelled south

205
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,840
our Monastery honoured the Zen sect

206
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,080
We have no connection with
Tibet's esoteric doctrine

207
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
Please go back

208
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,440
You dare disobey an imperial order?

209
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Shaolin will be eliminated
for disobedience

210
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,040
Come on, men!

211
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,720
Attack!

212
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,920
Kill them!

213
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,320
Attack!

214
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,680
The Manchurian troops are here...

215
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,680
Guard the monastery's gate, quick!

216
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,120
Guard the monastery's gate,
I'll protect the Abbot

217
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,120
Hurry

218
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
Abbot, the Manchurian troops
are attacking us

219
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,000
Order everyone to resist

220
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,080
Come with me to fight, hurry!

221
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,880
Those monks are all in the secret cells

222
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,840
Let's go!

223
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
It's in the front

224
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,800
The secret cell is underneath the well

225
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
Great, those monks are hiding in the cell

226
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,680
We will use dynamite to block the tunnel

227
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,440
They are all trapped

228
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
None of them can get away

229
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,400
Throw it down!

230
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,320
Hurry! Let's rush out and kill the Tartars

231
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,760
You protect the Abbot

232
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,760
Yes!

233
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,440
Spare my life!

234
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,320
Blow them up!

235
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,920
Abbot... run!

236
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,840
Where's the Abbot?

237
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,480
Abbot! He's in the secret cell

238
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,160
Abbot! Abbot!

239
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,160
Zhi Shan!

240
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,080
What happened to you?

241
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
You are back

242
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,440
Run! Hurry and run!

243
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,720
Use the dynamite to blow up the Monastery

244
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,800
Yes!

245
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,080
Let's go!

246
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,400
Abbot!

247
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
I can't make it,
you better run for your life!

248
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,040
No, Abbot. How can I leave you behind

249
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,520
Did you get what I ordered you to get?

250
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,480
Yes

251
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
But what's the use?

252
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,400
Yes, the Shaolin Monastery is destroyed

253
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,600
It's your duty to rebuild it

254
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,600
Do you understand?

255
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes, I'll risk my life

256
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
to have the Shaolin Monastery rebuilt

257
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,480
Go to the south

258
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,360
The people there have an unbending spirit

259
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,520
Go and solicit offerings

260
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,440
and look for heroic men

261
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,240
to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery

262
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,960
Yes!

263
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,640
Guang Dong and Fujin have famous mountains

264
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,080
South Shaolin must be rebuilt

265
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,240
Yes, Abbot, I will take up
this responsibility

266
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm relieved

267
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,920
South Shaolin must be rebuilt

268
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,320
Even though I've to beg every penny of it

269
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,040
Shaolin Monastery must be rebuilt
in the South

270
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,240
"Guang Dong"

271
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,400
Sir, please offer me a vegetarian diet

272
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,680
and allow me to stay for a night

273
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,120
Nonsense. I'm running a business,
not doing charity

274
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,880
Without money, even gods are unwelcome

275
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,120
Go away...

276
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
Master, please stay

277
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,280
His lodging and boarding

278
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,560
will be on me

279
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,880
Yes Sir!

280
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,280
Master, have a seat!

281
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,920
Thank you, Sir!

282
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,520
Li Ba Shan, are you sure
the information is correct?

283
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,080
Shaolin has been destroyed
and Zhi Shan fled?

284
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,800
Teacher, this is absolutely true

285
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,320
A relative of mine just came back
from Guang Dong

286
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,280
He saw a monk who begged alms

287
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,680
claimed that he would rebuild Shaolin
in the South

288
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,600
Good aspiration I'd say,
but it's not that easy

289
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,120
to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery
all by himself

290
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,880
Dao de

291
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,920
Why are you so dejected?

292
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,160
I just returned from the Wen Shu Temple

293
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,440
A general with an imperial appointment

294
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,920
for my teacher, honoring him as

295
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,840
a Taoist Chief

296
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,080
Teacher insisted on turning it down

297
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440
Wu Chen has no respect for His Majesty

298
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,760
When I tried to persuade him,
he thundered with rage

299
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
and said that
if I ever brought this up again

300
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,640
he'll evict me

301
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,800
With your fame and kung fu

302
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,560
you are no worse than teacher

303
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,600
You can earn the title unreservedly

304
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,920
Of course

305
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,320
but so far there's no imperial order

306
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
An imperial decree is here

307
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,040
You are Taoist Bai Mei?

308
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,840
It's my honor to meet you today

309
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,680
This is an imperial envoy

310
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,600
General Yue Ying Qi

311
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,600
General Yue

312
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,840
By imperial order

313
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,680
you are appointed as Taoist Chief

314
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,160
Please accept the imperial mandate

315
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
On your knees

316
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,760
I accept the imperial order

317
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,840
The imperial mandate reads:

318
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,440
Honouring Priest Bai Mei of Er Mei today,
I decree that

319
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,240
he be named as Head of Taoism

320
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,840
and spiritual leader

321
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Dao de, what's the time now?

322
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,640
It's already the fifth watch,
please take your medicine

323
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,560
Is there any news from Zhi Shan?

324
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,640
I hear he's gone south

325
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,560
to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery

326
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,480
Since he has the will,

327
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,640
he will succeed

328
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,240
Go and rest

329
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Yes!

330
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,320
The medicine...

331
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,240
You...

332
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,880
Teacher...

333
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,840
Why have you done this?

334
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,880
I'm under imperial order
to suppress the rebels

335
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,760
Teacher!

336
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,320
Wu Mei, go down south and find Zhi Shan

337
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,240
Rush to Guang Dong
to capture Zhi Shan alive

338
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,240
Hold it there!

339
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,760
If you want money, just take it

340
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,680
but don't hurt anyone

341
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,800
Let's go!

342
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,360
Silence him

343
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,600
Go away!

344
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,360
Let's go...

345
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,560
Thanks for your help

346
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,920
Fate has brought us together again

347
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,320
My home is just three miles from here

348
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,840
Please go there to have a rest

349
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,520
Thank you!

350
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,280
Please...

351
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,720
Sir, your kung fu is great

352
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,960
The best in Guang Dong

353
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,440
Of course

354
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,960
Uncle!

355
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,960
Jin Lun, since you like martial arts

356
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,120
I've invited a Shaolin martial artist here

357
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,400
Go and meet him in the sitting room

358
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,200
Uncle, in the martial arts world

359
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,400
many claim to be Shaolin kung fu experts

360
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,320
but they are mere imposters

361
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,680
Don't be taken in

362
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,280
How can you say such things?

363
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,840
When I was robbed on the road

364
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,440
he rescued me

365
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,960
You are naive

366
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,960
How do you know
he wasn't their accomplice?

367
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,320
Ah Fu!

368
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,040
Yes!

369
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,160
Bring the monk here

370
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,320
and I'll teach him a lesson

371
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
to see if he dares to cheat any more

372
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:07,960
Hurry and go!

373
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
Yes!

374
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,240
Jin Lun, you...

375
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,080
Sir, Master is here

376
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,120
Please!

377
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,560
Master!

378
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,880
Master... please

379
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,000
Let me introduce,
this is my nephew Jin Lun

380
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,840
Monk, did you knock down

381
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,440
several robbers on the road?

382
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,640
Yes!

383
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,440
So you also know kung fu

384
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,640
Only a smattering of it

385
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,920
Monk, how should one start
when learning kung fu?

386
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
One should start with breath control;

387
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,160
However, a young and
impulsive youth like you

388
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,080
should start with taking stances

389
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,400
That is the basis of all kung fu

390
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,000
Master, have a seat!

391
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,040
Thank you, sir.
But my sole purpose here is

392
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,560
to raise funds for rebuilding Shaolin

393
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,400
If you can sit firmly, we'll offer half of

394
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,240
our 20 silk shops in Guang Zhou

395
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,080
Deal

396
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,160
Deal

397
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,480
Hurry

398
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,760
Young Master...

399
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,240
Teacher, if you agree to take me
as your student

400
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,760
I'd rather give you all the 20 silk shops

401
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,400
Half is enough

402
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,800
Have you done what I've instructed you?

403
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,280
Don't worry!

404
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,320
Don't lie to me

405
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,200
They say, Master Zhi Shan

406
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,560
is an expert in kung fu

407
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,080
Master Zhi Shan's kung fu is fascinating

408
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,560
My nephew Jin Lun used to be haughty

409
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,480
But now

410
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,160
He has been totally overwhelmed by Master

411
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,600
You are too naive

412
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,600
to have given away
ten silk shops like that

413
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,440
In case he's a worldly monk

414
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,000
you'll have made a fool of yourself!

415
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,600
He's from Shaolin Monastery

416
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,160
It's impossible

417
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,680
I've got ways to find out

418
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,440
by testing him

419
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,440
If you find out he's honorable
you ought to

420
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,760
contribute more to
rebuild the Shaolin Monastery

421
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,600
No problem... everyone

422
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,960
We are all willing to contribute

423
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,320
but you can't let him know now

424
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,920
Of course

425
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,280
Good, deal

426
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,680
Bring the monk to my home tomorrow

427
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,840
I've an idea

428
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,840
Come... let me introduce

429
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,280
This is my good friend

430
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,480
He's Ling Ho,
a rich merchant from Guang Zhou

431
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,480
Meet Master Zhi Shan of Shaolin

432
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,240
An honour indeed to have you here

433
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,280
My mother maintains
quite close ties with Buddha

434
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,880
When she heard that
Master is in Guang Zhou

435
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,520
she insisted on your staying here
for a few days

436
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,240
and performing praying for her,
if it's okay with you

437
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,880
Since you are devout, I must accept

438
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,680
Great. Ah Gui

439
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,360
prepare some vegetarian food for Master

440
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,040
Yes!

441
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,600
Master, please come with me to the shrine

442
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,360
Yes!

443
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,600
Please!

444
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This way!

445
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,240
Hurry... put it down, hurry

446
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,000
Lift it up!

447
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,440
Miss Jinbao, Master is waiting for you

448
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
Follow me!

449
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,640
She's here!

450
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,440
Masters, sorry to keep you waiting

451
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,200
Jinbao, remember what I've told you

452
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,480
Don't worry, unless he isn't a man

453
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,840
I'll make him yield to my temptation

454
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,440
even if he's a Buddha

455
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,520
We'll count on you. Make good preparations

456
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,000
Just count on me

457
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,240
Master, please!

458
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,640
You must tired, please take a rest

459
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Thank you!

460
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,880
Help! Help! Master, help!

461
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,560
Who is it?

462
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,880
Help!

463
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,560
Miss, what happened?

464
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,120
My stomach ache recurs,

465
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,920
it can only be cured by a man's belly

466
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,440
pressed against mine

467
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,440
Master, please help me!

468
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,600
How can there be such a disease?

469
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,400
It's not appropriate for you to stay here

470
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,040
It really hurts!

471
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,840
You are a monk, you should be merciful

472
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,240
How can you not help me? It hurts!

473
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,880
If you don't go away, I'll leave

474
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Wait!

475
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,040
Thanks for your help

476
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,760
A small token of my appreciation

477
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,080
Madam

478
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,600
I saw this monk last night

479
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,640
he was really unmoved by beauty

480
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,280
but his greed got the better of him

481
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,560
Jinbao left a bag ofjewels last night

482
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,240
and he kept it

483
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,240
This shows he is not too respectable

484
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,240
Don't blame him. A monk is also human

485
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,360
Coveting small gains is inevitable

486
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,880
Right!

487
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,880
Were it you or me,
we mightn't even have been able to

488
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,040
resist Jinbao too, not to mention

489
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,840
the lure of money

490
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,680
Correct

491
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,360
Sir, Master is here

492
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,880
Please!

493
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,360
Good morning!

494
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,160
I picked this bag up
in the backyard last night

495
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,440
it contains valuable jewellery

496
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,080
It must be yours, so
I have come to return it

497
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,600
I admire you for not being greedy

498
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,800
but a monk shouldn't lie

499
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,320
You said you picked this up
from the backyard

500
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,880
I fear that's not the whole truth

501
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,040
You've reprimanded me well,

502
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,200
but as the origin of the jewelry
is questionable,

503
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,440
I'd rather not reveal the truth

504
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,080
or it may ruin someone's reputation

505
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,840
I'll take my leave

506
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,320
Master, wait

507
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,520
Your noble character is commendable

508
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,320
I'll contribute my share

509
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,600
for the rebuilding of
the Shaolin Monastery

510
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,240
What about you, gentlemen?

511
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,160
I've two mountains in Fujin

512
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,200
best suited for
building the Shaolin Monastery

513
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,480
You can take one

514
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,600
I'll donate half of
my profit in my business

515
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,040
for your disposal

516
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,880
I have 300 acres farmland

517
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,040
I'll donate them to Master

518
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,280
Thank you all!

519
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,680
Get lost!

520
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,680
Come out

521
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,240
Priest, what do you mean by this?

522
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,160
I just want some donation

523
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,760
No problem. Give him twenty coppers

524
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,920
Bull shit

525
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,880
Keep it for a beggar!

526
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,640
Then how much do you want?

527
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,520
I heard you promised

528
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
a Shaolin monk

529
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,600
that all your money would be given
for his disposal

530
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,360
Is it true?

531
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,960
I don't want much

532
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,440
Just fill up this tripod with silver

533
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,040
and I'll leave

534
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,040
Get lost!

535
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,400
Go in and get the silver

536
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,560
Listen, I'll sleep before the door

537
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,280
and whoever approaches, gets it

538
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,280
Priest

539
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,360
Scram!

540
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,640
Excuse me, it's him

541
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,080
May I know your Buddhist name please?

542
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm here to solicit offerings. Go away

543
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,040
This is not solicitation, it's blackmail

544
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,480
So what?

545
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,880
How is Wu Chen related to you?

546
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,120
I don't know him

547
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,400
How are you related to Bai Mei?

548
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,440
None of your business

549
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,200
Thank you Master!

550
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,560
Please come to Jing Chan Temple for a chat

551
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,000
Sister

552
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,520
Brother Zhi Shan

553
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,800
So you too have come to Guang Zhou

554
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,680
I saw what happened just now

555
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,760
That crook is called Lee Ba Shan

556
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,760
a student of Bai Mei

557
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,840
Bai Mei defected to the Qing regime
and killed teacher

558
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,640
Now they are after you

559
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,240
Master Wu Chen is killed!

560
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,480
I'll stay here for the time being

561
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,080
come to me if need be

562
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,600
How are you getting on with fund raising?

563
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,840
Guang Dong people are charitable

564
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,480
I have got enough money

565
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,400
I got a mountain site too

566
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,000
But I'd like to get more supporters

567
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,640
before going to Fujin
to build the Monastery

568
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,480
Make way, let me handle it

569
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:29,400
Try harder...

570
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,640
Make way

571
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,880
Where's that monk?

572
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,560
That way, to the south suburbs

573
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,560
Let's go!

574
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,720
Mr Lin, your knife is ready

575
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,960
Good! Gong Qian Jin, you are not bad

576
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,640
Thank you!

577
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,040
Don't mention it

578
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,040
Mr Lin, thirty coppers for it

579
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,160
Alright... thirty coppers

580
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,320
Give it to me!

581
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,000
I'm sorry, business isn't good

582
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,000
I will pay you tomorrow

583
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:31,920
No...

584
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,640
I won't be here tomorrow,
you must pay today

585
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,400
Well, I'll give you a piece of pork

586
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,040
Sauteed meat to go with wine

587
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,640
Alright! Give it to me

588
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,880
Gong Qian Jin, it's worth seventy coppers

589
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
I owe you thirty

590
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,560
Give me the change for forty coppers

591
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,640
I won't have it even for seven coppers

592
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,120
Take it back! And pay me back thirty

593
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,600
Did you see our rule here?

594
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,440
For goods once sold, there'll be no refund

595
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,280
You've taken the meat, give me the change

596
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,400
Damn you, pay me!

597
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,600
Are you paying or not?

598
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,040
Great, you've torn my clothes

599
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,480
My clothes are worth eighty coppers

600
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,240
So you have to pay me 110

601
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,280
Trying to evade payment?

602
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,760
How is it? Not bad

603
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,720
My pig's feet are not bad either

604
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,520
Are you trying to ruin my chances?

605
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,640
Are you blind?

606
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,800
This is the toilet

607
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,320
not a place for fighting

608
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,320
Smells good?

609
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,080
It stinks!

610
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,200
You bastard, don't run!

611
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,080
You two are good at kung fu

612
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,720
Don't hurt each other

613
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,880
for anger at the spur of the moment

614
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,400
You know nothing, monk

615
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,560
Go away!

616
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,360
Punches and kicks have no eyes

617
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,120
we don't want to hurt you

618
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,400
Damn monk, beat him up!

619
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,280
Butcher, we should fight him

620
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,880
Why are you hitting me?

621
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,280
The damn monk was behind us

622
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,720
Can't move any more?

623
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,680
Not bad

624
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,600
Don't move!

625
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,760
You are so obedient

626
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,280
I can take you as my students

627
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,080
Damn monk, I'll teach you a lesson

628
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,560
Beat him up

629
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,360
Teacher!

630
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,240
Teacher! I'm looking for you everywhere

631
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,680
Who did you fight with?

632
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,840
A priest with white eyebrows

633
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,640
He hit me with a duster

634
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,920
Priest Bai Mei

635
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,480
He has come to Guang Dong!

636
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,120
Seems he is making trouble here!

637
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,840
Let's go back first

638
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,800
Let's go and beg him to teach us kung fu

639
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,440
Right

640
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,040
Follow him!

641
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,360
Teacher!

642
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,080
Teacher!

643
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,320
Leave...

644
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,400
The magistrate is here

645
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,960
Greetings to Your Honour

646
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,200
Everyone please be seated

647
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,920
Anything we can do for you, sir?

648
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,600
You are all business magnates
in Guang Dong

649
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,000
and are well respected

650
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:02,320
But I can't cover up
any rebellion among you

651
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,280
Your Honour, what do you mean by this?

652
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,240
Are you keeping a Shaolin monk

653
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,480
at your home?

654
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,480
Our family are devout Buddhists

655
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,240
It's no surprise that
there are monks staying with us

656
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,040
Did you donate
half of your assets to that monk

657
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,400
to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery?

658
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,800
Charity is part of our humanity

659
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,560
If you hand over that monk to the Court

660
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,520
you'll get a title, what do you think?

661
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,800
I can't, I'm leaving

662
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,080
Mr Li

663
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,840
You'll be killed for
providing shelter to a rebel

664
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,560
You must hand over Zhi Shan in three days

665
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,040
or else you'll all be like him

666
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,760
Open the door! Jin Lun!

667
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,720
Open the door! Open up!

668
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,920
Uncle Wang, what's going on?

669
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,080
Jin Lun,
your uncle has already been killed by

670
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,240
Yue Ying Qi who was sent by the Court

671
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,840
The troops will be here anytime,
you'd better run!

672
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,680
Teacher! Hurry and leave!

673
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,520
You leave with Mr Wang first

674
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,600
Alright! Go!

675
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,240
This is the monk, capture him

676
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,360
Let's go!

677
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,000
Go and find Hong Xi Guan

678
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,040
Buy a casserole!

679
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,880
Sir, buy a casserole!

680
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,240
Hong Xi Guan, come over...

681
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,400
What is it? Why are you so nervous?

682
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,000
Li Jin Lun's home was sealed

683
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,920
Where could

684
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,200
Jin Lun and Master Zhi Shan be?

685
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,360
I want to fight with that monk and he left

686
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,440
Gui Jue Qi, come here!

687
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,640
Go and gather information

688
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,440
about them

689
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,640
We'll be at the Min Xiang Teahouse, go

690
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,640
Yes!

691
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,080
You wait for me at the Min Xiang Teahouse

692
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,440
I'll be there after I've packed up

693
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,640
Alright! Go!

694
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,000
Everyone, I'm sorry, I'm closing up

695
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,120
I am so sorry

696
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,240
Gui Jue Qi, hurry!

697
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,920
He's coming!

698
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,640
What is it?

699
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,960
What news have you got?

700
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,680
Li Jin Lun's uncle was killed by the Court

701
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,240
There's no trace of Zhi Shan and Jin Lun

702
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,000
Li Jin Lun is our brother

703
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,120
We can't stand by without helping him

704
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,240
Master Zhi Shan is wanted by the Court

705
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,960
We as his students
can't wash our hands off the matter

706
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,280
Zhi Shan is your teacher,
but I'm not convinced

707
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,240
I must fight with him

708
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,760
A monk won't count for much

709
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,160
I can break his ribs right away

710
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,040
Brother! Let me warn you

711
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,720
If you want to fight with my teacher

712
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,440
you'd better be prepared to suffer

713
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,760
We are not afraid

714
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,280
Let's split up and find out

715
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,920
and contact each other if there's any news

716
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,960
Don't go

717
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,560
I've no money today

718
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,920
who pays the bill?

719
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,440
None of our business, let's go

720
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,480
You're in bad luck!

721
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,160
Master Zhi Shan

722
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,840
When you have settled down

723
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,280
please let me know

724
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,040
I will, no need to see me off, goodbye!

725
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,200
Zhi Shan, you are hiding here

726
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,480
You've killed Master Wu Chen

727
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,360
Aren't you ashamed?

728
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,240
To kill rebels is a common thing

729
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,320
in the martial arts world,
what's the big deal?

730
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,880
That's exactly what I intend to do

731
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,000
Let's go!

732
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,760
This is the home of
my good friend Hong Xi Guan

733
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,520
He's a casserole vendor in town

734
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,560
Stay here to recuperate,
no one will find out

735
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,800
Take Sister Wu Mei inside and have a rest

736
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,720
After taking the herbs,

737
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,720
she'll recuperate soon

738
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,400
Does your friend practise kung fu also?

739
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,400
Yes, he's been practising the post

740
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,200
for three years

741
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,800
He has mastered the light skill

742
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,160
One with his perseverance must be good

743
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,760
I may recruit him in rebuilding
the Shaolin Monastery

744
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,640
But he's one of those
who think highly of themselves

745
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,400
and it's not easy to convince him

746
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,040
Alright, I'd like to test him
when he's back

747
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,400
Seeing is believing

748
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,800
You are Master Zhi Shan?

749
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,160
Yes, I am

750
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,720
He's my good friend

751
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,960
I've long heard of your excellent kung fu

752
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,560
I'd like to spar with you

753
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,640
I'm only a rowdy. Don't be pedantic

754
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,440
I never depart from punches and kicks

755
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,800
Great, we have much in common

756
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,760
In that case

757
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,600
could we have a match at the posts

758
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,200
Whoever falls

759
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,600
will have to kowtow three times

760
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,040
and greet the other as 'teacher'

761
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,920
Deal

762
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,560
Yes, it's a deal, please!

763
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,600
Wait!

764
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,840
Your posts are fixed

765
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,560
I'm not used to it

766
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,240
Let me hold up a few special ones

767
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,880
What do you think?

768
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,200
As you please

769
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,680
Casserole posts

770
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,440
Come up!

771
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,080
Great!

772
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,480
You're not bad with the fixed posts

773
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,080
but you need to practice on movable ones

774
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,440
Master, I have never in my life

775
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,920
kowtowed to anyone

776
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:42,400
Now... I

777
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:43,680
Arise...

778
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,520
Hong Xi Guan!

779
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,920
Master, I admit defeat

780
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,520
Please take me as your student

781
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,200
Hong Xi Guan, we have now become brothers

782
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,000
From now on, we are family

783
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,360
Teacher

784
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,960
Just now we saw a Tibetan Lama

785
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,920
drinking with several Qing officials

786
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,080
It's heard that
this lama came from the capital

787
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,320
with orders to capture you alive

788
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,040
Jin Lun, you hide with your teacher here

789
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,440
We'll go and find out

790
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,480
what kind of Hercules

791
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,600
this lama is!

792
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,960
Let's go!

793
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,240
Sir, please! Have a seat here!

794
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,520
Just sit here

795
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,200
Sit...

796
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,840
Over there, that's him

797
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,720
Ah Zhing, I think this monk

798
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,880
is quite good in kung fu

799
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,040
I'm only afraid of his staff

800
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,720
You cope with him, I'll go out for a while

801
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,680
The wine is here

802
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,600
What did you say to the lama?

803
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,520
I know the lama since from Tibet

804
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,600
Of course I was speaking to him in Tibetan

805
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,040
It seems that he didn't understand
what you said

806
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,360
Of course he did

807
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,760
Take it

808
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,760
This lama is terrific

809
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,280
Keep fighting with him

810
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,760
Double kicks, Three stars with the Moon

811
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,120
Gin Wa kick

812
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,480
Damn you, want to attack my behind?

813
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,040
Cannon Position. HeartPiercing Leopard

814
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,880
Carrying the sedan

815
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,920
The troops are here, run!

816
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,960
Lama

817
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,400
Where do you think these rogues are from?

818
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,840
They are riffraff

819
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,240
with uncouth skills

820
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,440
They are a disorganized gang

821
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,600
I think Zhi Shan's students did this

822
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,160
Magistrate!

823
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,040
Yes!

824
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,120
Enforce martial law and search
every household

825
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,880
We must trace Zhi Shan by all means!

826
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,280
Yes! Yes!

827
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,520
Come in at once!

828
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,240
Everything is now ready

829
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,040
Shaolin Monastery must be rebuilt
in three months' time

830
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,200
therefore we must go to Fujin
as soon as possible

831
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,760
But Bai Mei has ordered a curfew

832
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,160
It's hard for us

833
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,800
to get out of Guang Zhou

834
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,240
Where there is a will, there is a way

835
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,600
Make all the necessary preparations today

836
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,040
we'll charge out of the city tomorrow

837
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,560
Your Honour!

838
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,600
Stand still!

839
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,520
Open the coffin!

840
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,400
Attack!

841
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,960
Let's go

842
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,520
Run! Hurry and run!

843
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,320
Teacher, sea and land routes both
in Guang Zhou

844
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,240
are heavily guarded,
don't go out in the open

845
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,560
You'd better hide beside the pier ahead

846
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,640
We'll try and find a boat

847
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,560
When we have found one, we'll contact you

848
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,480
Alright!

849
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,520
Go!

850
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,840
There's no boat anywhere,
what should we do?

851
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,840
Let's split up to find one

852
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Alright!

853
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,040
It was this priest!

854
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,800
Great

855
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,560
I'm sure the six of us can get rid of him

856
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,800
Dao de, capture him!

857
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,920
Yes!

858
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,880
He's practised Golden Armour before,
everyone watch out

859
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,680
Attack!

860
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,240
I have practised the Golden Armour

861
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,880
all my pressure points are closed

862
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,160
Zhi Shan, you must remember

863
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,080
There are six critical pressure points
in a human body

864
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,680
that cannot be totally closed

865
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,720
even with protection of the Golden Armour;

866
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,520
There must be at least one vulnerable spot

867
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,120
Sail it over here

868
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,280
Teacher!

869
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,200
A boat is coming, Teacher!

870
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,800
Sail it over

871
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,240
Come on...
