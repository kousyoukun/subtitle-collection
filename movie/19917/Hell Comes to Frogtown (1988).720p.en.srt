1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,999
In the last days of the 20th century

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There were several currents of opinion

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,999
Experts from the time
believed that nuclear war

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,999
Would be limited to the
exchange of some pumps

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then horrified fighters,
would sit to talk peace

6
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,100
But they were wrong

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,100
In just 10 days, 10,000 years of
human progress turned to ashes

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
10 years later, they tried again

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
! Hey batracio!

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,000
What you got there?

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,400
Besides ugly, you're stupid

12
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,400
This is useless!

13
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
You know the law

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,400
Mutants can not carry weapons

15
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,400
HELL RETURNS TO Frogtown

16
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,100
Devlin, you're wrong friend

17
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,100
Everything you have said is a lie

18
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,100
Lie?

19
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,100
My daughter is not a liar

20
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,600
Think I'll start here

21
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,999
Captain Devlin!
How the hell did you get in here?

22
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This And that

23
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
What noses wants Medtech
of this place?

24
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,000
Him

25
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,499
This man was accused of sexual harassment

26
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,000
Your daughter has changed his statement

27
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,299
When she learned she was pregnant
, he changed his mind

28
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Pregnant?

29
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,300
That's impossible

30
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,900
That's what we thought,
before doing some tests

31
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,900
This man has a gun
loaded properly

32
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,200
And the provisional
government claims it Medtech

33
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,500
No, this guy is a scavenger

34
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
A thief

35
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,599
Takes advantage of young women

36
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,100
We know your history And yours

37
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
So we will move to the border

38
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,100
There's a truck waiting outside

39
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,100
Are you still here?

40
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,100
Some believe that women run
too much

41
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,499
And you

42
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
When you get out from under the skirts
Medtech

43
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I'll be there

44
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,500
Fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth

45
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
DO BABIES IS OUR WORK, OUR ONLY WORK

46
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
NO TO CONDOMS,
THE FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS

47
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,500
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT PROPERTY

48
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,500
Is this accurate?

49
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Mr Hell, no wonder
so popular with women

50
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,900
Va leaving a trail of pregnancies
by wherever he treads

51
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,299
Really?

52
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Has
rate higher than sperm have analyzed

53
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,299
Must be all the fiber
ate when I was little

54
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,299
I am authorized to clean by
complete your file

55
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,099
A drop all charges

56
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,099
The task of Medtech is impregnate
fertile women wastelands

57
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,099
We need young people with
power required for this job

58
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,000
Men can take care of themselves
and know the territory

59
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,000
They can work under adverse circumstances

60
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
You think you can do?

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,100
Are you serious?

62
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,100
Or maybe you prefer back with Devlin?

63
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,600
On the other hand, I have
always been a patriot

64
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,100
Sign this

65
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,400
The war reduced the population
male 68%

66
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
almost all race quedase sterile

67
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
But we are still at war
In a demographic war

68
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,400
Each side is desperate to rebuild and rearm

69
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,999
And for that labor it is needed

70
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You need people

71
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,000
That's where you come in

72
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,000
Is stuck It's an electronic lock

73
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,000
Only we have the code

74
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,599
From now on it will always put

75
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Sure

76
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,899
Help me get this off

77
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Is written

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,900
And it he has signed
Will you stay well

79
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,899
But how are you supposed

80
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
You know

81
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,900
It has a flap

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,899
Monitor your condition
physical-sexual

83
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
It is for their own safety

84
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,800
After all

85
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,900
You are equipping government

86
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,800
This recording was made before
it was chosen for this mission

87
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,799
And security measures, should be known only

88
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
By the main board of the
provisional government

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,099
18 months ago, a tribe of mutants,
carried out an ambush against

90
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
The Seventh Brigade Border Patrol

91
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,200
210 men and women were brutally murdered

92
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,500
We have reason to believe that several
civilians were taken prisoner

93
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,299
Rebels mutants possessed weapons fire
,

94
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
In strict violation of the fence
mutant isolation

95
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,600
We believe that the weapons were supplied
near Frogtown

96
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,300
How and who provided
remains a complete mystery

97
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,500
By here

98
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,200
This is Centinella
Watch the child for me, Corporal

99
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,199
I will not ride that

100
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
If you do not ride, you drag
tied to a string

101
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Add stallion

102
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Your team

103
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,700
Take good care There are not many like him

104
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I will fulfill my duty

105
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
I know it will

106
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
What soldier?
You do not seem very happy

107
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,500
As you want

108
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,500
Estés as you are, we are
fortunate to have you

109
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,500
Medtech
needs all the help it can get

110
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,500
We're still at war, you know?

111
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,500
Yes?

112
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Where do you go forward?

113
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Do not you ever take anything seriously?

114
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,800
I used to take it all seriously

115
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
But everything went to hell

116
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,300
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
Outpost 1444

117
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
PISA-SAPOS

118
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Could finish everything here and now

119
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
She would your bodies
the other side

120
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
To see how they catch the mutants

121
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,000
Or not

122
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
You leave like a sieve

123
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,700
Let's see who falls first
You or I

124
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,499
Let's all

125
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,800
Shut up!

126
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,100
One way or another, we will move

127
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,100
Let them pass

128
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Hey friend, almost you got me
cosan the ass shot,

129
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,099
And we are now entering
mutant territory at full speed

130
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,599
Fuck! I hope you know what you're doing

131
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,099
It seems you do not know or where
we are going Let's Frogtown

132
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,099
Commander Leader Toty has
kidnapped some pilgrims who had

133
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,099
I ventured into their territory
What has this to do with Medtech?

134
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,799
They are fertile women!

135
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Why would mutants
kidnap human women?

136
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,400
Rescue Toty knows how valuable
are the fertile Medtech

137
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,200
Or maybe you want for your harem

138
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Agg! That's gross

139
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,799
Yes, and let's do something about it

140
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
We're going to get there, and then you
the'll impregnate

141
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,199
Are you sure they wanted
to enter in the reserve?

142
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Do not dip your diaper, stallion
That is the goal of all this trip

143
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Now that you mention it, do you mind if I
a walk?

144
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Why?

145
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,800
I have to water the plants, okay?

146
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,100
Anybody with me?
You will not go far

147
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,100
No, right there behind that bush
I'll be right back

148
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
See you later, sisters!

149
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,100
Much later!

150
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,099
If someone other than me
try to disable the belt

151
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,600
A load of plastic explosive will detonate

152
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,299
At some point, the distance sensor
my active slope

153
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Quite painful shock, as you have seen

154
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,999
Although not cause serious damage

155
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,200
And if you get lost, my pager
sensor will take me straight to you

156
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,200
During the rest of the
mission, you and I will as one

157
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,200
Remember that, soldier

158
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,600
You know what? You are tremendous
with this light

159
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,600
See you tomorrow

160
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,900
I thought a man with your reputation
might have some hunger

161
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm full

162
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,900
Are you sure?

163
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,900
Or Maybe not

164
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,399
Sorry, I was just

165
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,100
Does anyone taught you or you were
born to be a heated crotches?

166
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,099
I was just following orders!
Orders?

167
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,099
Keep the subject in a state of arousal
it promotes sexual potency

168
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,500
Power?

169
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,100
I'm just doing my job!

170
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,300
Great! When we come back
I ask them to give you a raise

171
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I hate the military!

172
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,299
We can not make noise

173
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
This is against the rules

174
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm not fertile
They do not want to waste forces

175
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
So why

176
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,800
I heard stories about you

177
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I want to see if they are true

178
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,400
People talk too much

179
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,000
You can not blame them

180
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,400
With the shortage of men there, women
are very alone

181
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,300
How do I

182
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,300
It has a flap

183
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,300
Centinella not know if I
can meet your expectations

184
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,700
I think you're already serving

185
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
I fuck's sake!

186
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,800
Do not wear a uniform, Cabo

187
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
MUTANT
BOOK NOT HAPPEN

188
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,199
Do you know? You two have
ovaries the size of the moon

189
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,899
No one enters the reservation

190
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,899
Even the Border Patrol

191
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,999
How are we supposed to go?

192
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
With a plan

193
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,300
That's not a plan
Is a conspiracy to kill me!

194
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,200
I will not be part of it
You signed a contract

195
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,999
Si To fuck in exchange for my freedom,
not to croak in Frogtown

196
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,500
That's not in the contract!

197
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,500
Page 12, paragraph 8:
When we free the hostages,

198
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,500
You can use your potential

199
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,299
Okay, and what if I leave you pregnant
being in Frogtown?

200
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
What will happen to me?

201
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,899
Meets
contract and not have to find out

202
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,399
Oh yeah?
If

203
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Oh yeah?
If

204
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,600
What?

205
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,600
What if renegotiated?

206
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
What?
Not you Motion sensor

207
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,700
It might be a hostage Let's see
Get up!

208
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,700
Arise?

209
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,700
On the left

210
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
More to the left!

211
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,200
Still ahead

212
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,200
It moves Keep moving

213
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Left

214
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Facing

215
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,200

According to tests,
it is fertile

217
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,500
I bet you did not know

218
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,500
Where are you?

219
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,700
Log

220
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,700
You're scaring her!

221
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,700
Okay, Prince Charming, you try

222

She does not like your food

228
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,300
Quiet Spangle

There is no use if traumatized
Go preparing for work

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You can start

232
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,999
What are you talking about?

233
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
The girl

234
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,399
I've injected
Ovedol to facilitate procreation

235
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,100
's Why you're here, remember?
So no more?

Not even washed the teeth!

240
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
What is the problem?

241
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200

Do you have preferences?

A little atmosphere would be fine
Are not you going to tell me you have to

245
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,999
Be in love first?
Maybe we should force you

246
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,499
To make love with an unknown
in the middle of hostile territory mutant

253
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,700
You'm not a machine that can
turn off and on as you please, you know?

254
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,600
Come on man

Okay

263
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Frogtown is in that direction

264
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,499
Is it far?

265
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,499
I ran for a day and a night
Where are the other girls?

266
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,000
In the palace of the Commander Toty
Why they did not escape you?

267
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,000
They prefer passive resistance

268
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,700
They believe that only
docile inherit the earth

269
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,700
Sure

270
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,200
Okay Walk south for a few days

271
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,300
The Border Patrol will capture your signal
and take you to a hospital in Medtech

272
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,899
Do not worry The
mothers are national heroines

273
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,000
You treat her like a queen

274
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,500
Thank you!

275
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,500
Hold this

276
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,500
Colócamelas

00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,000
I am your prisoner now

278
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,000
I think I'll like it!

279
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,499
What doll?

280
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,000
Do not like being treated like a puppet?

281
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,000
Now you know how I feel!

282
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,999
Am I right?
Great

283
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Wait for my signal

284
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
Ãtame this to the waist

285
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,399
Do not try to take my earrings
If they lose contact with my body,

286
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Explode the device

287
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,400
If you go far away

288
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,399
Explode the device

289
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,300
And if you do not do exactly what
say, the device will explode

290
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,699
Understand?

291
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,399
Have you ever been told you
have a charming personality?

292
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,000
Move

293
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,000
I do not think so

294
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Quit the chain

295
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,500
We have to trust each other
Our lives depend on it

296
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,500
What?

297
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,500
You look good

298
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,500
We continue?

299
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,600
Why not? Since we are here

300
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Come on

301
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,100
Here comes another

302
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,100
Bartender, pour me a drink

303
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,299
And for me?

304
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,300
You're my prisoner

305
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Is it good?

306
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Know to industrial waste

307
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Never drink You endured well

308
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,800
Looney! Are you alive!

309
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I was told that stayed crushed in
a mine in Eagleton after the war

310
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
You know I have nine lives

311
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,399
Hello I am Looney O'Toole

312
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,900
Discoverer mother of Wapachuga beta

313
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,099
I called Looney Tunes because I'm so mad

314
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,100
I'm saner than anyone you meet

315
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,000
I see your taste has improved

316
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,400
You know

317
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,800
What is making a useless
like you in Frogtown?

318
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,800
I'm here for some business And you?

319
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,899
I am going wherever found uranium

320
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,900
And here's a bunch
Under our noses

321
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,700
Looney, if there were some uranium here,
it had extracted before the war

322
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,700
Cabezabuque Look, I'm being honest with you

323
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,099
If you do not believe me, just
to take a walk through the tunnel 43

324
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,900
And you see the frogs
pulling it out at all hours

325
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay, okay What the hell
will make mutants with uranium?

326
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,999
Sell it, I guess, for the
best price they can

327
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'll take 20%

328
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Listen Do you want to do business?

329
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,099
Yes
Well, you've come to the right place

330
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,600
But first you have to talk with Leroy

I tell you what I'll do I'll fix it for you
I'll be right back

332
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,800
That old should already be
80 years old when I was born

333
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,899
When I was a kid,

334
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,300
He was the only one
hassle of worrying about me was taken

335
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,300
Beware!
Watch where you're going

336
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,300
I love you

337
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,899
Do you want to talk about it?

338
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,899
It's our contact

339
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,343
She works in the harem Toty
Was the code to say

340
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,899
To say that the plan goes as planned

341
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,300
Moment What do you mean?

342
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,800
Boy do not want to wait for
a man like Leroy Come on!

343
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,399
What is this?

344
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,900
Revuelto

345
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,699
Take cooked,
tadpoles and desert lizard

346
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,799
Beat all together to make a paste

347
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Sorry for asking

348
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,500
It is a noble gesture, Mr Hell

349
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,900
Not much is these days

350
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,800
Can I offer you a drink?
Please

351
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,800
Beer!
Beer really!

352
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,100
Where did you get?

353
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,700
Some miners they found a
box in an abandoned mine

354
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,700
Is slightly radioactive

355
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,000
So

356
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,300
I have to congratulate you for
having such a refined taste

357
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,500
We did not see anything like it since
Bull brought these bitches

358
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,500
Zorritas?

359
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,000
Like it?
Yes

360
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,000
Were so delicate

361
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,500
The commander was so impressed
Toty amounting to Bull to first lieutenant

362
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,000
Bull?
Yes, it is the toady of Toty

363
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,000
I hate

364
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,200
Well, he hates all humans

365
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,500
There's enough resentment
against human around here

366
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,199
It was not bad enough
us, unfortunate creatures,

367
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,794
We were created as a byproduct of your

368
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,099
War, but it addition, your race,

369
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,300
I sending us to live in these reserves
as if we were cattle

370
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,300
I had nothing to do with it

371
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,300
I hate the government

372
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,899
All governments!
So

373
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,700
I am willing to offer 30 lilis
by this specimen first

374
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,900
No offense, but I've had
to cover many more expenses

375
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,700
Well, I understand, but

376
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,699
You see that the business is not going well

377
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,300
50 would look better?

378
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,399
It's a start

379
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,499
Let's have some fuel to the fire

380
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,000
Take a look at the lady

381
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Good bones!

382
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,400
Firm figure!

383
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Excellent teeth

384
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,200
It will provide countless
nights of pleasure

385
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,699
I misunderstood, Mr

386
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,700
I not seek a sex slave

387
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,499
Looking for someone who gets
fill the local public

388
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,000
Someone with real showmanship

389
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Do you know dance?

390
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,000
What if you can dance?

391
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,600
Of course he knows

392
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,400
He is a specialist in erotic dances

393
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,300
Excellent!

394
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,800
Excellent!

395
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,800
I have an idea

396
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,000
Wait a minute

397
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,500
Bull

398
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,500
Who brought this?

399
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,500
I did

400
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,000
What do you care?

401
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,200
Where are you, stranger?

402
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,400
From a very ugly place
You have a name?

403
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,999
Hell

404
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,500
Sam Hell I've never heard of you

405
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,500
Is it yours?

406
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,700
It's'm selling Leroy
A private barter?

407
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,000
Bull Yes, but Shut your mouth!

408
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,300
No bartering
allowed in private Frogtown!

409
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,299
It's the law of Toty!

410
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,200
Leroy knows!

411
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,700
It seems that your treatment
has been canceled

412
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,100
What do you think guys?
An auction?

413
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,300
We started for 5 lilis

414
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,300
Well?

415
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,200
The starting price is 5!

416
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,200
Sold by 5

417
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,200
It's not enough

418
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,400
Not again!

419
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,200
I said "sold by 5", pout!

420
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Leroy, this is closed until
that Toty says otherwise!

421
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,100
Everyone to work!

422
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,100
Sam!

423
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,100
I love you

424
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,100
Code

425
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,099
Where is everyone?

426
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Back in the mines
Bull has closed the bar

427
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,100
Again

428
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,100
You're very lucky

429
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,699
How have you noticed?

430
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,700
You're alive, right?

431
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
What's going on?

432
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm Arabella I swore to fight
to the death comandate Toty

433
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,200
Have your partner
led to the palace

434
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,200
Al harem?

435
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,799
Then everything goes as planned
Help me get in,

436
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Rescued the girls, we warn Centinella
and get out of here, right?

437
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,799
Theoretically

438
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,300
You're making me nervous

439
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,300
By the way

440
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,600
I do not know how to thank you
we're helping

441
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,600
I do

442
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,300
Wait a second,
I not even know you

443
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,499
But I know you

444
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Even here, your name
is legendary

445
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,499
Yes, Sam Hell, the lone
bum wastelands,

446
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,200
The intrepid war hero

447
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,200
How bad is it?

448
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,200
It's exhausting

449
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,300
I do not want to talk about it

450
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,300
I understand

451
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,500
Really?

452
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,000
You can rest here

453
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,000
I be different

454
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,099
Here men pounce on me,

455
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,800
As if it were an animal!
're Idiots

456
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,800
But you're a real man

457
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,499
What are you doing?

458
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Just promise me you'll be careful not

459
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,500
That I can promise!

460
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,500
Sam

461
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,500
I knew it would be fantastic!

462
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,100
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

463
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,300
Do me a favor Whatever Sam!

464
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,700
Cover yourself with this

465
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,700
So you're just a slave?

466
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,700
Take her with Toty!

467
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,700
Come on, bitch

468
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:58,100
Come with me
I want you to identify someone

469
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,200
That's how you like it, Sam?

470
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,500
's Perfect

471

I'm just a little freaky

472

It Is the belt If I pull away much
Spangle, explode

00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,100
Where is Spangle?

500
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,100
In the harem

501
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,300
Getting ready for a night
you will never forget!

502
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,200
Let's see if we can do the same for you!

503
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,900
You do not need that

504
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,900
I'm ready to talk

505
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,900
The Commander is very curious inventions
by Medtech

506
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,800
So I do some exploratory surgery

507
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,800
I feel so Viva?

508
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Without a great passion you can not
face the dance of the three snakes

509
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,800
Two companions went to the dance
with fear and did not survive

510
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,200
Something seems to disturb your senses

511
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,700
Or someone

512
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,900
Do not do it!
He's attached to an explosive!

513
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,900
In Medtech would not be so stupid as to fly
a powerful male!

514
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,100
What now?

515
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,400
What do you think?
I'll gasoline

516
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,500
This is fine

517
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,500
We have no time

518
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,500
For this

519
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,500
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

520
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,500
It's killing me!

521
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,900
I have to say
You're such a weirdo

522
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,299
Stay here Wait a minute

523
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,899
's My friend, not yours I'll go

524
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,000
You're too slow Too

525
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,699
You're not even human
What are you going to risk your neck?

526
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,799
To overthrow Toty

527
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,600
In addition, Sam is my friend

528
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,847
Well, if you're going to free
Sam, someone will have to

529
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:46,199
Shoot for the signal flare

530
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,100
I've been shooting flares from
before they disappeared the Dodgers

531
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,300
Okay Give me five minutes

532
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,500
Good luck

533
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Fuck! A sentimental reptile

534
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Kingdom to an explosive

535
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,500
It was fake!
He cheated me!

536
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,700
Remember what I told you

537
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,300
Remember the passion and will to survive
dance of the three snakes

538
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,900
What are the three snakes?

539
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,599
You! Come on!
Listen

540
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,699
Let's go now Let's get out of here!

541
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,699
We are subject to their will

542
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,700
Sometimes you have to do your will

543
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,800
I can out of here
Maybe you are right

544
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
Get your hands off me

545
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,800
Or maybe not

546
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,199
Are you okay?

547
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,200
Yes

548
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Everything is in place

549
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,200
I owe you one

550
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,800
Not now

551
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,800
Fucking bastard

552
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Dance for me!

553
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,800
I just dance on your grave!

554
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,800
Baila

555
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,100
Or Die!

556
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,600
Modern Ballet?

557
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,600
The dance of the three snakes!

558
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,600
The dance of the three snakes

559
01:00:36,956 --> 01:00:41,056
"Remember the passion and will to survive
dance of the three snakes"

560
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,000
What are you doing here?

561
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,000
Let me explain

562
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,000
Well

563
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
You have excited the three snakes!

564
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,500
Come with me!

565
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,500
I will not go near those things!

566
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,100
'No!!!

567
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,700
Wait

568
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,400
It occurred I have a new steps

569
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,400
Tragad lead, frogs!

570
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,600
Are you okay?

571
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,600
Yes, help me up

572
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,600
Ongoing

573
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,600
They have arrived

574
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,600
This is for you

575
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,800
Someone is giving them weapons
to verduchos

576
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,800
Someone named Count Sodom

577
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,500
It was your wife, right?

578
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,500
From my daughter

579
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,500
That's all I found

580
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,900
The war ended long ago

581
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,900
For me there

582
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,900
Shall we?
Why not, we're here

583
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,900
The three snakes

584
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,700
Are you sure you need me?

585
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,600
She did

586
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,299
It's a miracle!

587
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,599
Sure

588
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,900
Come on

589
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,900
Come here What happens now?

590
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,500
Are you going to swallow lead dust or?

591
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Wise decision

592
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:06,500
It's Centinella!
Over here!

593
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,500
Fun is over!

594
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,100
Not yet, friend!

595
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,600
Come on! I cover you!

596
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,600
Come on!

597
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
Come on!
Hurry, hurry!

598
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,300
Fast people, I parked in
double row

599
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,200
Quiet, son, quiet
Always in such a hurry

600
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,200
Start! Starts!

601
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,799
They're letting them escape

602
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,800
I expect you to do something about it

603
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,900
Now!

604
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,200
Come on!

605
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,800
You're amazing

606
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,400
I told you my plan would work

607
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,400
Yes, it's true

608
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,800
Do not take it so bad, son

609
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,900
I have lived my nine lives

610
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,900
I hope heaven is as good as this

611
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,499
Something is approaching fast

612
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Something bad

613
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,500
Tour!

614
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,500
Accelerate!

615
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
Shoot!

616
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,500
Leave it!
I'm fine

617
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,700
I throw them on the rocks
Let's do it

618
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,700
You are in my way

619
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,000
Everybody out

620
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:33,900
Now!

621
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,900
Find them!

622
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,400
I told you was not over,
Sam Hellman

623
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,600
You

624
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,300
#, You know this used to be a world
men, Sam

625
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,999
But now there are too many women!

626
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,400
Controlling what we do!

627
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,400
I'm going to change that!

628
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,100
I give weapons to the mutants
exchange uranium

629
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,500
And I will then give scientists
renegades to try him

630
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Go away Get away from him

631
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,800
I be the only one to have a nuclear weapon
since the war ended

632
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,900
Everything starts from scratch

633
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,900
The sword

634
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,900
Alcánzamela

635
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,400
I am a passive

636
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,200
I will save this world from those
whores Medtech

637
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,600
All going to die

638
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,200
Starting with her

639
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:39,200
Charlatan Son of a bitch

640
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,200
Welcome to the club

641
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Shit!

642
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,200
Where are you going?

643
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,300
Get this over with
Stay with the girls

644
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,400
Sam!

645
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,400
We will be waiting for you

646
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,400
Spangle

647
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,900
We made it!

648
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,900
Drop your weapons!
Soltádlas!

649
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,700
If you want to live, run!

650
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,700
You do not, Toty

651
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We will die together

652
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,000
Sam!

653
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,400
We thought you were dead

654
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,500
Where were you?
We hid when we saw that thing

655
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,499
I told you the plan would work
Plan?

656
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,499
It was a conspiracy to kill you
I'll kick your ass

657
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,800
Try it, you bastard!

658
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,799
To Why?

659
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,300
You have to save yourself for fertile
I have enough

660
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,700
No, you do not have

661
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,700
I no longer belong to you

662
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,700
So why did not you run?

663
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,100
Knew I'd miss me less

664
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,100
How's your shoulder?
You've been worse

665
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,100
Toma

666
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,600
What is this?

667
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,600
It is something to cling to,
when you feel alone

668
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,900
Medtech is in your debt

669
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,200
Perhaps when you turn your duty,
we can go a few weeks

670
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,300
That sounds great

671
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,000
What you mean
"when you fulfill your duty"

672
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,999
I guess what they say is true
What?

673
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
The job of a soldier never ends
