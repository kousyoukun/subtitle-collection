1
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,197
In the latter
days of the 20th century,

2
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,403
there arose a
difference of opinion.

3
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,329
The leading experts at the
time believed a nuclear war

4
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,161
would only involve the
exchange of a few bombs

5
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,462
and then the suitably
horrified combatants

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,131
would sit down at
the peace table.

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,835
They were wrong.

8
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,263
In just 10 days, 10,000
years of human progress

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,511
was virtually blown to dust.

10
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,104
10 years later,
they tried again.

11
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,831
Hey, squidlips.

12
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,262
What you got there?

13
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,716
You're not only ugly, squidlips.

14
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,096
You are stupid.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,186
This is good for nothing.

16
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,405
Hey.

17
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,780
You know the law.

18
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,992
Greeners can't have guns.

19
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,541
Friend.

20
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,999
You got that wrong, friend.

21
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,122
Anybody who says any
different is a liar.

22
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,339
Liar?

23
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,295
You lie on my daughter.

24
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,100
I think we'll start here.

25
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,441
Captain devlin.

26
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,586
How the hell did
you get in here?

27
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,352
With this and this.

28
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,436
And what the hell
does med tech want here?

29
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,866
Him.

30
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,450
This prisoner is
accused of sexual assault.

31
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,574
Aw your daughter
has changed her story.

32
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,357
Once she found out
she was pregnant,

33
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,582
she must've had a
change of heart.

34
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Pregnant.

35
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,958
Oh that's impossible.

36
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,712
That's what we thought
too until we ran some tests.

37
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,216
This man is carrying a
loaded weapon and med tech,

38
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,765
on a provisional government
authority, now claims it.

39
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,093
No, this man is a scavenger.

40
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,438
And a thief.

41
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,556
And he preys on young women.

42
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,893
We know his record and yours.

43
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,445
That's why you're being
reassigned to the border.

44
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,488
There's a truck waiting outside.

45
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,085
You're still here?

46
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,626
Some people think women
are running too many things.

47
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
And you.

48
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,428
If you ever get out from under
the skirts of the med techs,

49
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,482
I'll be there.

50
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,818
Doctor ingram to
hematology stat.

51
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,366
Nurse McHenry.

52
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,371
Nurse McHenry report to sperm
bank with specimen already.

53
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,331
Code blue.

54
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,460
Code blue maternity.

55
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,587
Repeat code blue maternity.

56
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,800
Is this accurate?

57
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,884
Paging doctor Howard.

58
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,548
Mister hellman, I can understand

59
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,974
why you're so popular
with the ladies.

60
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,023
You've left a string of pregnancies
everywhere you've been.

61
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,393
Is that a fact?

62
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,524
You have the highest
sperm exosome count

63
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,865
we've ever tested.

64
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,612
Must've been all that
fiber I ate when I was a kid.

65
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,365
I'm authorized to
offer you a clean slate.

66
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,821
All charges dropped.

67
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,805
Now med tech's main
assignment is to locate

68
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,288
and impregnate fertile
women in the wastelands.

69
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,416
Now we need potent
young men in the fields

70
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,122
to assist in this great work.

71
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,877
Men who can take
care of themselves.

72
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,503
Who know the territory.

73
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,302
Who can perform under
difficult conditions.

74
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,505
Do you feel up to it?

75
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,056
Are you serious?

76
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,470
Well maybe you'd rather
we sent you back to devlin.

77
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,694
On the other hand, I've
always been a patriot.

78
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,520
Orderly to central supply.

79
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,861
Sign this.

80
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,364
Doctor denton
telephone nurses station.

81
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,864
Doctor denton please
telephone nurses station.

82
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,999
Through the emergency room,
ambulance entrance three.

83
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,672
Tech, report to ambulance three.

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,059
The war reduced our
male population by 68%.

85
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,933
It made most of the
human race sterile,

86
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,059
but we're still at war.

87
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,232
A population war.

88
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,651
Each side is desperate
to rebuild and rearm.

89
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,063
Now that requires manpower.

90
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,694
Manpower requires people.

91
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,071
And that's where you come in.

92
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:17,994
Yeah.

93
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,446
It's stuck.

94
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,406
It's an electronic lock.

95
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,831
Only we have the code.

96
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,706
The ecr stays on at all times.

97
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,047
Right.

98
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,049
Now come on and help
me get this off.

99
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,386
It's in here.

100
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,673
You signed.

101
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,015
It stays on.

102
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,142
How am I supposed to you know?

103
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,479
There's a flap.

104
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,977
It monitors your
physio sexual condition.

105
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,353
It's for your own protection.

106
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,983
After all, it's
government equipment now.

107
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,445
This is a prerecorded
briefing made prior

108
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,526
to your selection
for this mission

109
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,158
in which for security reasons
of the highest importance

110
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,490
has been known only
to the prime counsel

111
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,541
of the provisional government.

112
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,461
18 months ago a tribe
of mutant greeners

113
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,586
ambushed the seventh mogul
brigade of the border control.

114
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,044
210 women and men were
brutally massacred.

115
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,380
We have reason to believe
that several civilians

116
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,808
traveled with the brigade
have been taken hostage.

117
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,806
The rebel greeners
possessed firearms

118
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,006
except from our lead
that the firearms

119
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,644
were obtained somewhere
near frogtown.

120
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,776
How and from who the
weapons were obtained

121
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,698
is still a total mystery.

122
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,873
Ow.

123
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,834
Qver here.

124
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,958
This is centinella.

125
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,460
Watch him for me, corporal.

126
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,801
Will the driver of an apc

127
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,550
please clear the
runway immediately?

128
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,347
I'm not going in that.

129
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,675
You don't ride, we'll
drag you on a chain.

130
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,522
Get in, stud.

131
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,236
Your equipment.

132
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,196
Take good care of him.

133
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,941
There aren't many like him left.

134
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,282
I'll do my duty.

135
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,694
I know you will.

136
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,402
What's the matter, soldier?

137
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,739
You don't look happy.

138
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,371
Suit yourself.

139
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,324
Whatever you are, damn
lucky to have you.

140
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,205
Med tech needs every
hand it can get.

141
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,503
Still at war, you know.

142
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,425
Yeah?

143
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,296
Which way to the front?

144
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,297
Don't you take
anything seriously?

145
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,132
Used to take
everything seriously.

146
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,013
Then they blew it up.

147
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,745
I can end it all here right now.

148
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,582
Throw your bodies
across the line.

149
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,013
Say the greeners got you.

150
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,849
Or not.

151
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:49,977
They'll gun you down.

152
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,477
Let's see who drops
first, me or you.

153
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,229
Hey, hey, hey.

154
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,566
Whoa, whoa.

155
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,724
Let's just all...

156
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,069
Shut up.

157
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,736
One way or another
we're going through.

158
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,742
Let them pass.

159
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,673
Hey lady, you just about got
my ass shot off back there.

160
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,778
Now we're going into
hostile mutant territory

161
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,103
at full throttle.

162
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,666
Damn I hope you know
what you're doing.

163
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,848
I hate to think
you're just lost.

164
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,477
We're going to frogtown.

165
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,338
Their leader, commander toty,
has kidnapped some pilgrims

166
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,898
who wandered into
their territory.

167
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,854
And what's that to med tech?

168
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,314
They are fertile women.

169
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,239
Why would mutants want
a kidnap human females?

170
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,865
Ransom.

171
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,126
Toty knows how valuable
fertiles are to med tech.

172
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,782
Or maybe he wants
'em for his harem.

173
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,003
That's disgusting.

174
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,068
Yeah and we're gonna
do something about it.

175
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,092
We're gonna get them out

176
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,880
and then you're gonna
get 'em pregnant.

177
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,879
Are you sure you really wanna

178
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,393
get yourself on the reservation?

179
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,018
Don't rust your diapers, stud.

180
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,979
That's the whole point
of this joy ride.

181
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,517
Well now that
you've mentioned it,

182
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,156
mind if I take a little stroll?

183
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,867
Why?

184
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,668
I gotta water the roses, huh.

185
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,888
No armed escort?

186
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,588
You're not going far.

187
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,764
No, just right there
behind that bush.

188
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,102
Be right back.

189
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,948
See you later, sisters.

190
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,293
Much later.

191
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,565
If anyone but me
tries to unlock the ecr,

192
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,268
a one ounce charge of plastic
explosive will detonate.

193
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,029
Beyond a certain point, the
proximity sensor in my earring

194
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,159
activates the ecr
electronic stinger.

195
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,616
As you can see, it
can be quite painful,

196
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,001
but not terribly damaging.

197
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,670
And if you get lost,
my directional finder

198
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,999
will lead me right to you.

199
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,835
For the rest of this mission,
you and I are like one unit.

200
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,216
Remember that, soldier.

201
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,751
Hey you know, you look
terrific in this light.

202
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,129
See you in the morning.

203
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,018
I just thought a
man of your reputation

204
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,937
might still be hungry.

205
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,275
I'm full.

206
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,322
Are you sure?

207
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,916
Or maybe not.

208
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:12,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

209
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,252
I was just...

210
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,572
Did someone teach you or are
you just a tease by nature?

211
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,302
I was just following orders.

212
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,128
Orders?

213
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,473
Regulation 12.

214
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,077
Keep the subject in
an excited state.

215
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,181
It promotes potency.

216
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,759
Potency?

217
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,186
I'm just doing my job.

218
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,558
Good.

219
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,019
Well when we get back, I'll
have 'em give you a raise.

220
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,266
I hate the army.

221
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,158
Sh.

222
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,411
We can't make any noise.

223
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,958
This is against regulations.

224
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:31,750
Huh?

225
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,088
I'm not fertile.

226
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,246
They don't want you
wasting yourself.

227
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,671
Well then why?

228
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,500
I heard stories about you.

229
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,011
I wanted to see
if they were true.

230
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,340
Oh, people talk too much.

231
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,638
Oh.

232
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,059
Can't blame 'em.

233
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:54,357
With male rationing in the last
few years, women get lonely.

234
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,566
How do I?

235
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,908
There's a flap.

236
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,156
Oh.

237
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,047
Centinella, I
don't know if I can

238
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,545
live up to your expectations.

239
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,084
Let's say you already have to.

240
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,396
Holy shit.

241
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,186
You're out of uniform, corporal.

242
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,339
You know, you two ladies

243
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,403
must have moons for balls.

244
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,316
Nobody goes on the reservation,
not even the border patrol.

245
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,420
How the hell are we
supposed to get them out?

246
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,496
With a plan.

247
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,793
That's no plan.

248
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,826
That's a plot to murder me.

249
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,377
I'm having no part of it.

250
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,955
You signed a contract.

251
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,915
Yeah, to fuck for freedom,

252
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,966
but I ain't meeting
my maker in frogtown.

253
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,215
That's not in my contract.

254
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,260
Page 12 subparagraph eight.

255
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,137
If we can't get the girls out,

256
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,764
your field potency
will then be utilized.

257
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,351
Okay.

258
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,711
Okay but what if I
get them pregnant

259
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,855
and we're still in frogtown?

260
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,986
What happens to me?

261
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,632
Fulfill all the
terms of your contract

262
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,050
and you won't ever
have to find out.

263
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:05,688
Oh yeah?

264
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:06,488
Yeah.

265
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,281
Yeah?

266
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,618
Yeah.

267
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,116
Yeah.

268
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,453
What?

269
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,370
Let's renegotiate, huh.

270
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Aw.

271
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,766
Ah.

272
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,471
What?

273
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,263
Not you.

274
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,601
Motion tracker.

275
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,769
We got a live one.

276
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,392
Let's check it out.

277
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,730
Get in.

278
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,142
Getin?

279
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Veer left.

280
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,587
More left.

281
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,633
Go right.

282
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:52,802
It's moving.

283
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
It's still moving.

284
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,302
More left, more left.

285
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:02,899
Right.

286
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,108
There it is.

287
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,211
According to the test I just
ran on her, she's fertile.

288
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,595
What a find out here.

289
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,645
Where are you from?

290
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,600
Identify yourself.

291
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:45,942
You're scaring her.

292
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,398
Okay prince charming you try.

293
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,739
Okay.

294
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,614
Don't be afraid.

295
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,245
Come on.

296
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,586
It's good for you.

297
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,213
That's a girl.

298
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,173
There you go.

299
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,508
Good for you.

300
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,922
She don't like your
cooking either.

301
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,726
Easy, spangle.

302
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,489
What are you doing?

303
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,250
She's no good to us traumatized.

304
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,751
Go get ready for work.

305
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:25,875
You can start now.

306
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,202
What are you talking about?

307
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,547
The girl.

308
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,172
I've injected her with novaldol
to facilitate procreation.

309
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,216
That's why you're here remember.

310
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,553
Just like that?

311
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,129
Yeah, she's ovulating and
you've got a high count.

312
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,474
Let's go.

313
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,014
Oh come on.

314
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,352
I can't work like this.

315
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,175
Come on, hellman.

316
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,136
It's late and I'm tired.

317
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,847
She's never ever
brushed her teeth.

318
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,307
What is the matter?

319
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,386
Well, she's not my type.

320
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,064
Your type?

321
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:55,860
Yeah.

322
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:56,857
You have preferences?

323
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,484
Well yeah you know.

324
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,943
If I kinda know her and
there's a chemistry there.

325
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,967
You know a little
atmosphere would be nice.

326
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,391
Oh next you're
gonna be telling me

327
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,621
you have to be in love first.

328
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,574
Well maybe you
oughta try making love

329
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,355
to a completely
stranger in the middle

330
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,665
of a hostile mutant territory.

331
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,041
See how you like it.

332
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,965
You need inspiration.

333
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,639
What are you doing?

334
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,311
Relax.

335
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,559
I've been trained in
seduction techniques.

336
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Right.

337
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,742
I'm not a machine you
can just turn on and off

338
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,741
whenever you want to you know.

339
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,468
Oh come on.

340
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,156
I guess I'm gonna have to
live up to my contract.

341
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,913
Spangle, put your blouse on.

342
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,041
Come on, put your blouse on.

343
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,761
Take your glasses off.

344
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,213
You clean her up?

345
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,586
Not me.

346
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,474
I'm grabbing some down time.

347
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,857
Kay.

348
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,175
Frogtown is back that way.

349
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,288
How far?

350
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,697
I ran all day and all night.

351
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,162
Where are the other girls?

352
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,954
They're in commander
toty's palace.

353
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,956
Why didn't they escape with you?

354
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,707
They're from an
order of passives.

355
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,880
Resistance is not their way.

356
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,426
They believe only the truly
meek will inherit the earth.

357
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:30,763
Right.

358
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,016
All right.

359
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,765
Go south for a few days.

360
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,705
The border patrol will
pick up your signal

361
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,082
and evac you to a
med tech hospital.

362
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,106
No, no, no, no.

363
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,688
Don't worry.

364
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,145
Mothers are national heroes.

365
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,645
You'll be treated like a queen.

366
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,279
Thank you.

367
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,384
Hold these.

368
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,019
Put those on me.

369
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,201
Now I'm your prisoner.

370
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,110
Oh I think I'm gonna like that.

371
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,875
Aw what's wrong, baby?

372
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,296
Don't like being treated
like a puppet on a string?

373
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,964
Now you know how I feel.

374
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,225
Good cover?

375
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,351
The best.

376
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,435
Watch for my signal.

377
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,020
Tie this around my waist.

378
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,144
Don't try to take my earrings.

379
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,067
They lose contact with my
body, your equipment blows.

380
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:56,486
You get too far away,
your equipment blows.

381
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,566
And if you don't do
exactly what I say,

382
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,118
your equipment blows.

383
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,117
Understood?

384
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,698
Did anybody ever tell you
have a wonderful personality?

385
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:06,961
Move out.

386
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,629
I didn't think so.

387
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,310
Would you stop with the chain?

388
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,043
We have to trust each other now.

389
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,541
Our lives depend on it.

390
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,470
What?

391
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,018
You look good.

392
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:13,736
Shall we?

393
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,145
Might as well as
long as we're here.

394
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,261
Come on.

395
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,297
There goes the neighborhood.

396
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,814
Bartender, give me a drink.

397
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,533
What about me?

398
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:25,868
You're my prisoner.

399
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,412
Remember?

400
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,880
That good?

401
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,884
Taste like industrial waste.

402
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,889
You never
could hold your liquor.

403
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,802
Looney, you're alive.

404
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,267
They told me that
you were pancaked

405
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,694
in a mineshaft in
needletown after the war.

406
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,067
Oh, you know I got nine lives.

407
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,027
Howdy, I'm Lonnie O'Toole.

408
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,202
Discoverer of the
wachachooga motherload.

409
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,248
They call me looney tunes
because I'm so crazy.

410
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,451
I'm saner than anybody you know.

411
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,171
Well I see you're
taste has improved.

412
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,794
You know.

413
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,298
What's a worthless pup
like you doing in frogtown?

414
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,345
Doing a little trading.

415
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,888
What about you?

416
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,887
Oh I go where the uranium is.

417
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,391
Found a big pocket here
right under their noses.

418
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,291
Looney, if there
was any uranium here,

419
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,727
they would've mined
it out before the war.

420
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,936
Listen pinhead, I'm
being foursquare with you.

421
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,400
Now if you don't believe me,

422
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,359
just take a walk
over to tunnel 43

423
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,363
and watch them greeners
digging it out now.

424
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,704
Fine, fine.

425
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,371
What the hell them mutants
gonna do with all the uranium?

426
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,034
Sell it I guess for
whatever they can get.

427
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,379
I get 20%.

428
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,916
Listen, you wanna barter huh?

429
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,175
Yeah.

430
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,573
Well you came to
the right place,

431
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,428
but you gotta talk
to Leroy first.

432
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,766
He runs the joint.

433
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,601
Tell you what I'll do.

434
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,009
I'll fix it up for you.

435
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,354
Be right back.

436
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,732
That old man must've been
80 years old when I was born.

437
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,189
I was down for the count.

438
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,277
He was the only man that took
the time to bother with me.

439
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,371
Come on.

440
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,533
Look out flat lips.

441
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,751
Yeah watch
where you're going, will you.

442
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,553
I love you.

443
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,304
You wanna talk about it?

444
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,300
She's our contact.

445
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,348
A handmaiden to the
harem at toty's palace.

446
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,886
I love you is the code phrase.

447
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,852
Means everything
is going to plan.

448
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:00,644
Oh.

449
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:01,562
So far.

450
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,231
What do you mean so far?

451
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,296
Hey kid, you don't keep
a man like Leroy waiting.

452
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Come on.

453
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,873
What is this?

454
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,214
Glush.

455
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,207
Boiled baby tortoise
and brown lizard.

456
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,168
They grind them up together and
they make a paste out of it.

457
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,513
Sorry I asked.

458
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,561
A noble gesture, mister hell.

459
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,488
You see it so rarely these days.

460
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,700
May I suggest a chaser?

461
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,037
Please.

462
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,042
Beer.

463
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,715
Real beer.

464
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:11,541
Where'd you get...

465
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,886
Sh.

466
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:18,382
Some miners found a case
in an abandoned mine.

467
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,593
It's only slightly radioactive.

468
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:30,435
Now then, I congratulate
you on your fine piece.

469
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,358
We've not seen the likes

470
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,565
since bull brought
in those wenches.

471
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,705
Wenches?

472
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,078
Wenches.

473
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,416
Like her?

474
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,330
Yes.

475
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,284
They were most delicate.

476
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,379
Commander toty was so impressed,

477
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,548
he promoted bull to
his first lieutenant.

478
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,553
Bull?

479
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,588
Yeah, that's
commander toty's Butler.

480
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,466
Oh he hates me.

481
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,675
Well he hates all human beings.

482
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,308
There is a lot of bad
feeling towards humanity here.

483
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,396
It wasn't bad enough that
we unfortunate creatures

484
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,319
were created as a by
product of human warfare,

485
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,988
but then your kind,
your kind herded us on

486
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,987
to these reservations
as if we were cattle.

487
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,489
Hey, I had no part in that.

488
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:22,866
I hate the government.

489
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,157
All government.

490
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,619
So, I'm prepared
to offer 30 lilies

491
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,376
for this fine specimen.

492
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,423
No offense, mister.

493
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,501
I'm looking at a
lot of expense here.

494
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:41,590
Well, I understand but you
can see how bad business is.

495
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,472
Would 50 be more to your liking?

496
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,973
It struck a spark.

497
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,765
Now let's see if we
can light a fire.

498
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,520
Take another look at the lady.

499
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,739
Good bones.

500
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,611
Firm figure.

501
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:08,079
She could supply you with
endless nights of pleasure.

502
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,080
You misunderstand me, sir.

503
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,582
I do not seek a sex slave.

504
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,842
I want something to
bolster sagging attendance.

505
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,966
Something with real showmanship.

506
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,723
Can she dance?

507
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,426
Can she dance?

508
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,886
Of course she can dance.

509
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:33,149
She's especially good
at erotic dancing.

510
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,810
Excellent.

511
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,990
Excellent.

512
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,700
I have an idea.

513
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,197
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

514
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:55,841
Bull.

515
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,795
Who brought this here?

516
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,052
I did.

517
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,390
What's it to you?

518
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,722
Where you from, stranger?

519
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:09,677
Nowhere nice.

520
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,228
Got a name?

521
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,358
Hell.

522
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,693
Sam hell.

523
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:15,861
Never heard of you.

524
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,602
She yours?

525
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:18,947
Barter to Leroy.

526
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:20,696
Private barter?

527
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,113
Well yes, bull.

528
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,566
Shut your hole.

529
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,952
No private barters
allowed in frogtown.

530
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,624
Toty's law.

531
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,542
Leroy knows that.

532
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,080
Looks like your deal
just got canceled.

533
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,712
How 'bout it, boys?

534
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,053
Auction?

535
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,723
I start the bidding at 5 lilies.

536
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,272
Well?

537
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,603
The bid stands at five.

538
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,526
Well high bid five.

539
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,857
It ain't good enough.

540
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,657
Not again.

541
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,163
I said it was high bid
five, flat lips.

542
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,879
Leroy, your shut down
til toty says otherwise.

543
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,710
Everybody, back to work.

544
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,220
Sam.

545
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,027
I love you.

546
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,030
Oh, the code.

547
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,157
Right.

548
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,827
Where is everyone?

549
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,993
Back at the mines.

550
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,789
Bull has closed
the saloon again.

551
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,662
You're very fortunate.

552
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,048
How do you figure that?

553
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,468
You're alive, aren't you?

554
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,847
What's going on?

555
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,300
I'm Arabella.

556
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,682
I'm sworn to fight
commander toty to the death.

557
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:20,694
To the harem?

558
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,686
Well then we're
right on schedule.

559
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,692
You slip me in, I bust 'em out.

560
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,989
Signal centinella and
we're out of here right.

561
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,947
In theory.

562
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,404
You making me nervous.

563
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:10,984
By the way, I don't know how
to thank you for helping us.

564
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,080
I do.

565
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,868
Oh wait a second, lady.

566
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,870
I don't even know you.

567
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,667
But I know you.

568
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,620
Even here your name is legend.

569
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,168
Yeah, Sam hell.

570
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,875
Hellman wonder of the wasteland.

571
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,220
The fearless war hero.

572
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,925
Is that so bad?

573
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,266
It's real tiring.

574
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,760
I don't wanna talk about it.

575
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,185
I understand.

576
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,150
You do?

577
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,225
You can rest right here.

578
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,604
I'll be different.

579
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,281
Around here men throw
themselves at me.

580
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,950
I can have my pick.

581
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,699
They're all idiots.

582
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,200
You are a real man.

583
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,200
Oh, what are you doing?

584
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,082
Just promise me
you won't be gentle.

585
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,423
Ah.

586
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,044
That I can promise.

587
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,092
Oh Sam.

588
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,919
I knew it would be great.

589
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,724
Wait a minute.

590
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,059
Just one minute.

591
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,310
Do me a favor.

592
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,351
Anything Sam.

593
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,020
Put this on.

594
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,351
So you're just a slave, huh?

595
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,606
Take her to toty.

596
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,861
Come on you wench.

597
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,995
Come with me.

598
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:47,000
I want you to identify someone.

599
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,006
Is this how you like it, Sam?

600
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,883
It's perfect.

601
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,760
Just a little kink of mine.

602
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,272
What is that?

603
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,066
It's the ecr.

604
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:11,020
Spangle gets out of
range, it's gonna explode.

605
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,319
I know a shortcut to tunnel 43.

606
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,664
Ah.

607
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:23,749
Go on without me.

608
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,121
Where?

609
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,460
Count sodom.

610
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,545
The bargain is sealed.

611
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,012
What's this?

612
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,517
Oh, just someone we're
having for dinner tonight.

613
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,099
Sorry I can't join you.

614
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,107
The first shipment.

615
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,158
There shall be another
within one week.

616
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,756
Oh.

617
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,217
Sam.

618
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,047
Sam.

619
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,389
Seize him.

620
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,846
Take him away.

621
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,183
Prepare her.

622
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,394
Sam.

623
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,354
Sam.

624
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,153
Easy baby girl.

625
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,490
I'm on your side.

626
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,074
What can we do to help them?

627
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,412
Now?

628
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,415
Not a thing.

629
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,674
I'm spangle of med tech.

630
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,298
I've come to rescue you.

631
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,266
How?

632
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:28,436
With a plan.

633
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,230
I see.

634
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,982
What are you doing?

635
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,400
As our captors commanded.

636
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,607
Awakening your body.

637
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,840
Where's spangle?

638
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,419
In the harem being prepared

639
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,300
for a night she'll never forget.

640
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:08,803
I'll see if I can
do the same for you.

641
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,439
Hey, you don't need that.

642
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:24,990
I'm ready to talk.

643
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,285
The commander is very curious
about med tech inventions,

644
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,698
so I'm going to do a
little exploratory surgery.

645
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,159
I feel so...

646
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,504
Alive?

647
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,121
Yes.

648
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,318
Without great passion,
you cannot face the dance

649
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,128
of the three snakes.

650
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,085
Two of our companions
went to their fate

651
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,045
cold with fear and
did not survive.

652
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,093
Something seems to have
stirred your senses.

653
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,689
Or someone.

654
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:46,818
Don't do it.

655
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,365
It's wired to blow.

656
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,990
Med tech wouldn't be stupid
enough to wire a potent male.

657
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,092
Huh?

658
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,389
Now what?

659
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,256
What do you think?

660
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,601
To get more gas.

661
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,899
This is nice.

662
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:27,981
We don't have time for this.

663
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,990
Cut it off.

664
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,335
Cut it off.

665
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,667
It's killing me!

666
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,650
I gotta tell you.

667
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,319
You are one weird dude.

668
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,494
Stay here old man.

669
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:14,829
Wait a minute.

670
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,195
He's my friend, not yours.

671
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,540
I'll go.

672
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,935
Well you're too
slow for the action.

673
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:19,539
To?

674
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,162
Hell you're not even human.

675
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,709
Why should you risk your neck?

676
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,046
To overthrow toty.

677
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,581
Besides, Sam's my friend, too.

678
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,280
Well if you free Sam,
somebody else is gonna have

679
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,295
to fire the signal flare.

680
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,970
I've been firing
flares ever since

681
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,549
before they disbanded
the Dodgers.

682
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:37,894
You're right.

683
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,343
Give me five minutes.

684
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:41,856
Good luck.

685
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,230
Cursed sentimental reptile.

686
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,355
Wired to blow?

687
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,738
It's a fake.

688
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,076
She tricked me.

689
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,457
Remember this passion.

690
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,581
Keep the fires high
and you may survive

691
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,458
the dance of the three snakes.

692
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,005
What are these three snakes?

693
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,468
You come on.

694
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,387
Listen, let's all go.

695
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,090
Just walk right out of here.

696
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,092
We bend with the
wind will break.

697
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,843
Sometimes you
make your own wind.

698
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,730
I can get you out.

699
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:05,982
Maybe you're right.

700
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,965
You get your hands off me.

701
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,153
Stop it.

702
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,739
Then again.

703
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,703
Are you okay?

704
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,040
Yeah.

705
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:24,709
All there.

706
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,171
I owe you one.

707
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,761
Not now.

708
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,525
Dirty bastard.

709
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,164
Dance for me.

710
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:58,425
The only dance I'm gonna do
is the dance on your grave.

711
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,629
Dance or die.

712
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,643
Modern or ballet?

713
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,894
The dance of the three snakes.

714
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,691
Dance of the three snakes.

715
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,244
Okay.

716
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,237
Remember this passion

717
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,252
and you may survive the
dance of the three snakes.

718
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:54,692
Wow.

719
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,446
What are you doing here?

720
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,792
Oh.

721
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,159
Well let me explain.

722
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:57,755
Ah.

723
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,553
All right.

724
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,828
You have aroused
the three snakes.

725
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,019
Come to me.

726
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,100
I ain't going near
any of those things.

727
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,441
Now.

728
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,193
Wait.

729
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,065
I just thought of
some new steps.

730
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,373
Eat lead froggies.

731
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,258
You okay?

732
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,839
Yeah, help me up.

733
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,304
Let's boogie.

734
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,858
They've arrived.

735
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,530
They're beautiful.

736
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,998
Someone's dealing
guns to the greeners.

737
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,621
Somebody named count sodom.

738
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,582
It was your wife's, wasn't it?

739
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,014
My daughter's.

740
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,007
It's all I could find.

741
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,802
The war was a long time ago.

742
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,273
Not for me.

743
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,945
Shall we?

744
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,621
Might as well while we're here.

745
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,808
The three snakes.

746
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,160
Sure you need me?

747
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:23,252
They will.

748
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,213
It's a miracle.

749
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,006
Right.

750
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,584
Let's go.

751
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,382
Here come on over.

752
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,926
What is it now?

753
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,100
You boys are gonna
eat dirt or lead.

754
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,973
Wise choice.

755
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,188
Centinella.

756
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,530
This way.

757
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,452
Fun's over.

758
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,207
Not yet, warty.

759
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,085
Go on, I'll cover.

760
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,058
Go.

761
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,186
Come on, come on.

762
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:22,884
Let's go, let's go.

763
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,514
Fast, fast, fast.

764
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,113
Come on people.

765
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,524
I'm double parked here.

766
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,211
Easy son.

767
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,037
Easy.

768
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,620
You're always in such
a god dern hurry.

769
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:03,641
Go.

770
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,013
Go, go, go, go.

771
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,480
You're letting them get away.

772
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,984
I want you to do
something about it now.

773
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,319
Forward!

774
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,102
You're really something.

775
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:32,013
I told you my plan would work.

776
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:37,904
Yeah you did.

777
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,630
Don't take it so hard, son.

778
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:07,181
I've lived my nine lives.

779
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:17,433
I sure hope that
heaven's this good.

780
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,869
Something's coming up
fast behind us and it's bad.

781
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,129
What?

782
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,471
Turn the wheel.

783
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:02,698
Hit it.

784
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,899
Fire.

785
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:43,947
I'm okay.

786
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,990
I'm all right.

787
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,205
I can lose them in the rocks.

788
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,282
We're gonna make it.

789
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:12,559
Going my way?

790
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:16,810
Everybody out.

791
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:19,733
Now.

792
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,501
Find them.

793
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,488
You see this used to
be a man's world, Sam,

794
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,195
but now there are too many women

795
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,906
that have us by the short hairs,

796
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,328
but I'm going to change that.

797
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,459
I deal arms to the
greeners for their uranium

798
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,668
and then I give it to renegade
scientists for processing.

799
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:32,722
Get away.

800
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,718
Get away from him.

801
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,642
Soon I shall have the only
nuclear weapon since the war.

802
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,315
And then I'll wipe
the slate clean.

803
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,151
Crosse, sword.

804
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,719
Then I'll get
rid of the weak ones.

805
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:53,232
And the criminals.

806
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:54,693
Hand it to me.

807
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,115
I'm a passive.

808
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:00,948
And then rid this world of
those meddling med tech bitches

809
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,412
who are all gonna die
starting with her.

810
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,564
Long winded son of a bitch.

811
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,070
Welcome to the club.

812
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:34,784
Damn.

813
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:43,919
Hey.

814
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,288
Where you going?

815
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,836
To finish it.

816
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,413
Stay with the girls.

817
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:54,471
Sam.

818
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:55,805
Sam.

819
01:13:58,643 --> 01:13:59,643
We'll be waiting for you.

820
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,669
Spangle.

821
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,479
We got 'em.

822
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,400
Drop your weapons.

823
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:19,741
Drop 'em.

824
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,824
If you wanna live, run.

825
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,789
Not you, toty.

826
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:33,627
We're going down together.

827
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,722
No.

828
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,037
Sam.

829
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,208
Sam.

830
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,134
Sam.

831
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,268
We thought you were dead.

832
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:25,817
Where were you?

833
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,675
When we saw that
thing we took cover.

834
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,355
I told you the plan would work.

835
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,280
Plan?

836
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,198
That was a plot to murder me.

837
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:33,776
I oughta kick your butt.

838
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,782
Oh just try it, buster.

839
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:41,753
Stop.

840
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:42,920
Why?

841
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,504
You have to save
yourself for fertiles.

842
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,921
I have enough.

843
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,374
Oh no you don't.

844
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,137
I ain't on your leash no more.

845
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,053
Then why didn't you run off?

846
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,014
I knew you'd miss me.

847
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,607
Hey, how's your shoulder?

848
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:13,986
I'd have worse.

849
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,539
Here.

850
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:22,453
What's this for?

851
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,997
Something to hang on
to when you're alone.

852
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,060
Med tech owes you a lot.

853
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,651
Maybe after you
complete your duties,

854
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,853
I can get us a couple
of weeks leave.

855
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,773
That sounds great.

856
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,407
What do you mean when
I finish my duties?

857
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,457
I guess what they say is true.

858
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:12,802
What's that?

859
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,377
A soldier's work is never done.
