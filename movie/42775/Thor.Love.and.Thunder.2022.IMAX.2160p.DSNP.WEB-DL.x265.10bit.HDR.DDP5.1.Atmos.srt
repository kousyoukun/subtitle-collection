1
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,640
全知全能的拉普
Oh great, mighty Rapu.

2
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,960
我们向您祈祷
We pray to you

3
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,620
请赐予我们水和食物
for water and sustenance.

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,730
我向您祈祷并非为我自己
I pray to you, not for me...

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
是为了我的女儿
But for my daughter.

6
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,670
我好累啊
I'm tired.

7
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,540
你受尽苦难
You have suffered...

8
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,780
来找我
Come to me...

9
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,030
你受尽苦难
You have suffered...

10
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,030
来找我
Come to me...

11
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,280
你们看这是什么啊
Ah, what do we have here?

12
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,060
快看
Look at it...

13
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,280
它把我的水果都吃光了
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

14
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,050
拉普
Rapu.

15
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,610
光明之神
Bringer of light.

16
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,270
原来是我的信徒
Oh, it's one of mine.

17
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,940
我是格尔
I am Gorr.

18
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,840
是您最后的信徒
The last of your disciples.

19
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,680
我们已经一无所有了  大人
We have lost everything, my lord.

20
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,590
土地干涸了
The land is dry.

21
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,970
一切生灵不复存在
All life is lost.

22
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,070
但我们对您的信仰从未动摇
But our faith in you, never wavered.

23
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,170
如今我们等待着您的承诺...
And now we await the promise...

24
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,530
永恒
of the eternal reward.

25
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,870
您就是在庆祝这个吧
Is this why you celebrate?

26
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,680
他还以为能获得永恒
He thinks there's an eternal reward.

27
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,460
不  抱歉
No... No, sorry.

28
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,250
怎么可能给你永恒  你这条狗
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

29
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,220
我们不过是在庆祝杀戮
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

30
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,070
我们刚刚击败了黑死剑的主人
We just vanquished the holder of the Necrosword

31
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,340
-你受尽苦难   -他就没法再用那把被诅咒的剑伤害别的神了
-You have suffered   -before he could harm any other gods with that cursed blade.

32
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,730
-如果你寻求复仇...   -他竟然还威胁要毁了我的帝国
-If it's revenge you seek...   -He threatened to end my entire empire.

33
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,310
但大人...
But my lord...

34
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,960
您的帝国已经不在了
Your empire has already ended.

35
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,110
已经没有人追随您了
There's no one left to worship you.

36
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,750
还会有更多追随者代替你的
There'll be more followers to replace you.

37
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,450
一直如此
There always are.

38
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,740
我们受尽苦难
We have suffered...

39
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,030
我们饱受饥饿
And we have starved.

40
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,690
我的女儿死了
My daughter died...

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,870
以你之名
in your name.

42
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,260
这是你们的命
And well, you should.

43
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,860
你们存在的意义就是替你们的神受苦受难
Suffering for your gods is your only purpose.

44
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,970
你们死后  迎接你们的
There's nothing for you after death...

45
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,030
也只有死亡
except death!

46
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,550
你才不是什么神
You are no god.

47
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,660
我不会再追随你了
I renounce you.

48
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,560
现在  你这条没用的小命...
Now, your meaningless life...

49
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,290
终于能派上点用场了
finally does have a purpose.

50
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,960
你这条命  就献给我了
To sacrifice yourself to me.

51
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,210
如果你寻求复仇...
If it's revenge you seek...

52
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,630
屠戮众神
Kill all the gods.

53
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,660
迈向永恒
Go to Eternity.

54
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,950
如果你寻求复仇...
If it's revenge you seek...

55
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,250
召唤彩虹桥
Summon... The Bifrost...

56
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,140
迈向永恒
Go to Eternity...

57
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,050
召唤彩虹桥
Summon... The Bifrost...

58
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,570
实现永恒
Go to Eternity.

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,020
屠戮众神  屠戮众神  屠戮众神
Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.

60
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,070
这把剑选择了你...
The sword chose you...

61
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,670
但现在你被诅咒了
But you are now cursed.

62
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,990
有意思
Funny...

63
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,930
我没觉得这是诅咒
It doesn't feel like a curse.

64
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
更像是诺言
Feels like a promise.

65
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,550
那么  我的誓言就是...
So this is my vow...

66
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,470
我会杀光所有的神
All gods will die.

67
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,750
过来
Come...

68
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,410
过来  凑过来
Come, gather round...

69
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,980
听我说说太空里的维京人传奇
And listen to the legend of the Space Viking.

70
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,420
他又被称作雷神
a.k.a. "The God of Thunder".

71
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,480
也叫"索尔·奥丁森"
a.k.a. "Thor Odinson".

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,360
索尔从小被当作战士来培养
Raised in the way of the Warrior...

73
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,020
接受教导要为世间带来平衡
Thor was taught to help bring balance.

74
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,490
为那些无法战斗的人而战
Fighting the good fight, for those who can't fight it.

75
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,230
他长啊  长啊
He grew and he grew,

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,930
长大成人
and he grew.

77
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,630
他很敏感  像个微笑
He was sensitive, like a smile.

78
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,460
他有爱的天性对所有人一视同仁
And his loving nature did not discriminate.

79
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,920
他爱过一个当侠盗的时装师
He once loved a swash-buckling fashionista.

80
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,090
还有一次  他爱上一个女狼人...
Another time, he loved a wolf woman...

81
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,180
骑在一匹母狼上
on a woman wolf.

82
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,230
但索尔的真爱是一个地球女人  简·方达
But Thor's one true love was an Earth woman named Jane Fonda.

83
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,470
等下  不对
Oh, wait no...

84
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,340
简·福斯特
Jane Foster.

85
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,370
不过很遗憾
But sadly...

86
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,840
在爱情的战场上  索尔输了
In the battle for love, Thor lost.

87
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,590
说实话  他那段时间失去了很多人
In fact, he lost a lot of people in those days.

88
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,890
他的母亲
His mum.

89
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,100
他的父亲
His dad.

90
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,640
那家伙
And that guy.

91
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,650
那家伙
And that guy...

92
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,040
管他是谁
And whoever that is.

93
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,350
海姆达尔
And Heimdall.

94
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,310
他弟弟
And his brother.

95
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,970
又是他弟弟
And his brother again.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,300
还是他弟弟
And again.

97
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,960
可怜的索尔不得不看着自己的星球炸裂
Poor Thor had to watch his planet explode.

98
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,880
然后他问  "我都做了什么啊"
And then he said, "What have I done?"

99
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,430
似乎他爱的人和物全都不在了
it seemed that everything and everyone he loved, he lost.

100
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,300
所以他把心藏在肥肉之下...
And so he hid his heart behind a big, fleshy bod...

101
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,810
这样他就不会再心碎了
So it could never be broken again.

102
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,840
不过他不想再心动  不代表他不会再战斗
But just because he was done loving, didn't mean he was done fighting.

103
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,880
他和银河护卫队搭上了伙
He teamed up with the Guardians of the Galaxy...

104
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,850
启程踏上经典的索尔式冒险
and set off on some classic Thor adventures.

105
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,570
他重塑体型
He got in shape...

106
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,440
付出很多努力
Putting in the hard yards...

107
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,370
化伤痛为动力
Turning pains into gains...

108
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,810
从来不在下肢训练上偷懒
And never skipping leg day.

109
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,460
他从大叔身材变成大神身材
He went from dad bod to god bod

110
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,120
但在大神身材之下
But beneath this god bod...

111
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,860
还是有个伤心的人儿想解放出来
There was still still a sad bod, just trying to get out.

112
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,670
因为索尔这么多年来的各种伪装
Because all of the bods that Thor had worn over the years...

113
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,300
都无法隐藏他内心的痛苦
couldn't hide the pain that he was feeling on the inside.

114
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,450
所以他放弃了寻找
So, he gave up his search for nothing,

115
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,550
接受了这个事实  即他只擅长做一件事
accepting that he was only good for one thing,

116
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,260
静静冥想  等着有人过来说
waiting in quiet contemplation for someone to say...

117
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,310
索尔
Thor...

118
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,610
我们需要你帮忙打赢这场仗
We need your help to win this battle.

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,850
索尔...
Thor...

120
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,610
我们需要你帮忙打赢这场仗
We need your help to win this battle.

121
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,660
走吧
Let's go.

122
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,330
好的  来吧  暴风战斧
Ok. Come on, Stormbreaker.

123
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,520
该干活了
Back to work.

124
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,760
搞快点行吗
We must hurry, okay?

125
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,910
会死人的
People are dying.

126
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,570
那边见
See you down there.

127
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,330
抓紧
Hurry up!

128
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,220
这个给我
Gimme those!

129
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,560
你会弄坏这东西的
You're gonna break it.

130
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,270
-我是格鲁特   -哎呀上面全是你的口水
-I am Groot!   -Oh, you got sap all over it.

131
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,900
哈喽大家好啊
Hello, everybody!

132
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,070
好啊  看看是谁大驾光临了
Well, well... Look who it is!

133
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,650
-大家都怎么样啊   -惨极了
-How are we doing, guys?   -Horrible!

134
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,830
我们都要死翘翘了
We're all about to die!

135
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,440
你说这趟星球之旅是个放松的假期
You said, this planet would be a relaxing holiday.

136
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,290
我是说  它会像是个放松的假期
I said, it was going to be like a relaxing holiday.

137
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,810
看看那华丽的天空胜景  三个恒星绕着土星
Well, look at that resplendent skyscape. Three suns of Saturn.

138
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,700
有什么能比这更让人放松呢
What can be more relaxing than that?

139
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,300
有啊  货真价实地度次假
An actual holiday!

140
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,470
去死吧  渣滓们
Die, Booskan scum!

141
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,280
-雷霆之神   -雅坎国王
-God of Thunder!   -King Yakan.

142
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,820
你终于来参战了
You have finally joined our fight.

143
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,390
就像他们说的  晚了总比不来强
Well, as they say, better late than not at all.

144
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,140
很好
It's very nice.

145
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,820
你知道的  我们曾经生活在和平的绿洲中
As you know, we used to live in peaceful oasis.

146
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,610
-但是不久前  我们的神被谋杀了   -谋杀
-But then, our gods were murdered.   -Murdered?

147
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,840
现在  我们的圣殿已经无人守护
And now, our sacred temple has been left unguarded...

148
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,510
哈伯斯卡的部落还掌控了它的力量
And Habooska's horde took control of it's power.

149
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,520
这是我们最神圣的圣地  他亵渎了它
It is our most sacred shrine and... He desecrates it.

150
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,600
不会再这样下去了
Not for long.

151
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,580
雅坎国王
King Yakan...

152
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,670
告诉他们今天在这里发生了什么
Tell them what happened here today.

153
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,770
告诉他们就在此刻  本人索尔
Tell the time that I the Thor...

154
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,470
还有一群乌合之众...
Ragtag, motley crew, misfit desperados...

155
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,950
扭转了战局  将他们的名字刻在了历史长河中
Turn the tide in the battle and etch their names in history.

156
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,060
我们可能没法稳操胜券...
The odds may be against us...

157
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,570
-但我可以告诉你这些   -来了来了
-But I'll tell you this for free.   -Here we go.

158
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,690
此时此地就做个了断

194
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,150
多经典的索尔式冒险啊
What a classic Thor adventure.

195
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,380
好耶
Hurrah!

196
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,200
是本好书吗
Good book?

197
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,350
当然是
Yeah.

198
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,530
我写的
I wrote it.

199
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,350
你是  你是简·福斯特博士吗
You're... You're Dr. Jane Foster?

200
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,320
是我没错
I am.

201
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,380
-你好啊  -你好
-Hi!   -Hi!

202
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,880
关于黑洞  你怎么看
How's the Einstein-Rosen bridge?

203
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,810
很难
Tough.

204
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,880
-是的   -真的很难
-Yeah.   -Really tough.

205
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,880
它是...你需要一个3D模型
It's...You need a 3D model.

206
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,750
你看过《黑洞表面》吗
You ever seen Event Horizon?

207
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,540
没有
No.

208
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,520
-《星际穿越》呢   -也没有
-Interstellar?   -No.

209
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,450
那部电影把一切都解释的很清楚了
That movie explains everything really clearly.

210
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,240
嗯  好吧
Um, alright.

211
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,800
黑洞折叠空间
The Einstein-Rosen bridge folds space...

212
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:19,000
导致A点和B点能像这样共存
So that point A and point B will coexist in space, like that.

213
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,640
你亲手毁坏了你自己的书
You just ruined your own book.

214
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,510
是这样  但现在你搞明白黑洞了
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

215
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,210
-去看看那些电影   -好的
-You watch those movies.   -Okay.

216
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,090
看到了辣味薯片  我得拿一个
Saw the hot Cheetos. Had to get it.

217
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,540
那...情况怎么样了
So how's...how's it going?

218
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,640
很棒的
It's going amazing.

219
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,070
那你...
Have you...

220
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,680
-有没有告诉其他人  除了我   -没有
-Told anyone else besides me?  -No.

221
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,580
当人们发现这事之后  他们就会变得很奇怪
When people find out. they start acting weird.

222
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,890
他们就...
They're just...

223
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,780
变得不太一样了
different.

224
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,430
我现在不害怕了
And I'm not afraid now.

225
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,040
无论如何  也没那么严肃
Anyway, it's not that serious.

226
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,960
简  到第四阶段晚期了
Jane, it's stage four.

227
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,050
一共有多少阶段
Out of like, how many stages?

228
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
-四个   -我们只知道四个罢了
-Four.   -That we know about.

229
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,360
哦你现在是有...
Oh, you have uh...

230
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,950
其他地方要去吗  比化疗更重要的
Somewhere else you gotta be right now, that's more important than chemo.

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,050
没...
No...

232
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,300
你想试着回到实验室里  对吗
You're trying to get back to the lab, aren't you?

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,710
-我有几个想法正在尝试   -好的  停  暂停
-I have a few ideas I'm trying.   -Okay, no. Time out.

234
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,970
我知道你认为你的实验室工作是必须去做的
I know you think your lab work is something you have to do.

235
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,700
不然你就会让全社会感到失望  但是
Otherwise, you're letting down all civilization, but...

236
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,620
你并没有真正意识到宇宙在向你传达的信息
You're not getting what the universe is actually trying to tell you...

237
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,360
让我来给你翻译一下
So let me translate.

238
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,410
把生活放慢些
Slow. Down.

239
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,260
用你的能量去跟这个东西战斗
Use your energy to fight this thing.

240
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,980
我会用我自己的方式战斗的  好吗
I'll fight it my way, okay?

241
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,540
哦对了  仅供参考
Um, FYI...

242
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,410
"我的方式"不等于一个人在实验室
"My way" does not have to equal alone in a lab.

243
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,180
或许是时候用太空维京人这张牌了
Maybe it's time to play the Space Viking card.

244
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,510
-那不是张牌   -它就是
-It's not a card.   -Yes, it is.

245
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,230
-没有牌的   -有一张的
-There's no card.   -There's a card.

246
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,950
它很高  有一头金发  很绚丽
It's tall, and blonde, and it's gorgeous.

247
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,250
是张很帅的牌
It is a handsome card.

248
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,090
-简  你确定吗   -听着  黛西
-Jane, are you sure?  -Look, Darcy...

249
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,160
我会自己去
I will figure this out...

250
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,370
搞清楚的
By myself.

251
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,660
反馈回来的结果都一样
Results are just coming back the same.

252
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,570
我怕化疗没什么大用
I'm afraid the chemo has very little effect.

253
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,040
我很遗憾  简
I'm so sorry, Jane.

254
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,920
有什么我可以帮到你的  或者你想谈谈  给我打电话就好
If there's anything I can do or if you just wanna talk, call me.

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
哦  还有个事儿
Oh, one more thing.

278
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,950
你们有个姐姐来着
You have a sister.

279
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,680
现在我要化作神之星尘  与你们道别
And so now I turn into godly stardust and say farewell.

280
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,480
快看
Oh, look.

281
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
你们看见了吗  真的发生了
Do you see? It's happening.

282
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,320
我在消逝
I'm disappearing.

283
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,840
-不   -父亲
-No!   -Father!

284
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,650
等一下  哥
But wait, brother!

285
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,190
我们身后出现了一扇不祥的传送门
An ominous portal has appeared behind us.

286
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,720
变身
Transform!

287
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,460
我是海拉  死亡女神
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

288
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,760
现在我回到阿斯加德  名正言顺地继承属于我的王位
Now, I return to Asgard, to stake my claim as the rightful heir to the throne.

289
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
没人能阻止我
And no one will stop me!

290
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,650
不追随我便受死吧
Join me or die.

291
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,220
我们绝不会追随你  女巫  上吧  喵喵锤
We'll never join you, witch. Mjölnir.

292
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,200
这不可能
Impossible!

293
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,840
我把你锤子捏爆了
I broke your hammer!

294
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,280
受死吧
Time to die!

295
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,240
-彩虹桥   -彩虹桥
-Bifrost!   -Bifrost!

296
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,990
从这些宏伟而难以移动的碎片之上
You can almost feel the power

297
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,230
你们几乎能感受到它原本的力量
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

298
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,870
好了  我们该回村子里去了...
Okay, let's head back to the village...

299
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,010
去喝点地道的阿斯加德蜜酒
where we can drink some real Asgardian mead.

300
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
走吧
Come on.

301
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,560
灾难之神
God of Disaster...

302
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,620
我们谢谢您
We thank you.

303
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,680
没有了神的保护  我们还担心会陷入无尽的战争
We feared we would be at war forever without the protection of our gods.

304
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,080
但现在  我们会迎来和平
But now, peace shall reign.

305
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,970
为了报答您  请收下这些礼物
In return for your service, please accept these gifts.

306
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,710
这是我们的传统  将巨兽赠与我们世界的守护者
It is tradition, protectors of our world are bestowed with great... beasts...

307
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,680
-巨羊吗   -好家伙  看着很猛
-Giant goats?   -Oh, look at those. They are wonderful.

308
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,660
寇格  你快看  小羊长得可太好看了
Korg, look at that. Those things are beautiful.

309
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,980
雅坎国王  太感谢你了
King Yakan, thank you so much.

310
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,870
话说  关于那个神殿的事儿
Listen um... about the temple.

311
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,360
-我不想谈神殿   -知道知道  我是说如果要谈的话
-I don't want to talk about the temple.   -I know, but if we were to talk about it.

312
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,640
-我觉得它对生命和其他物质很重要...   -这事让我悲痛
-I think it's important to life and material objects...   -It's making me sad

313
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,810
-还有愤怒   -好吧我不说了
-and mad.   -Okay, I'll stop talking.

314
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,890
别忘了带羊
Don't forget the goats,

315
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,430
你接受了就要带走
which you accepted and now must take with you.

316
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,480
不能返还咯
No backsies.

317
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,900
它俩真是太美了
Awh, they are beautiful.

318
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,360
确实  很美
Yes, they are beautiful.

319
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,900
-也挺爱嚎的   -不碍事的
-They also scream quite a lot.   -They'll be fine.

320
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,980
-我是格鲁特   -我们得找到遥控器才能下载求救信号
-I am Groot.   -We need to find a damn remote so we can download the distress signal.

321
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,310
你得往回想  你把遥控器放哪了
Well, re-retrace your steps. Where did you put the remote?

322
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,710
指不定是羊给吃了
One of these goats probably ate it.

323
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
羊才不吃遥控器  别扯了
Goats don't eat remote. Don't be ridiculous.

324
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
好吧  我可不会去它们的大便里翻
Well, I ain't digging through their crap.

325
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,190
我爱它们
I love them.

326
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,050
它们应该永远跟我们在一起
They should live with us forever.

327
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,170
找到遥控器啦
Found the remote!

328
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,470
我要宰了它们
I'm putting them down.

329
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,570
-我也是  -管用了吗
-Me too.  -Is it working or not?

330
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,100
不行啊  没用  这玩意儿没充电
No, it's not working. It's not charged.

331
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,200
-那你该找充电器了   -给我让开
-Well maybe, you need to find the charger.   -Get out of the way
不行啊  没用  这玩意儿没充电
No, it's not working. It's not charged.

332
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,950
-那你该找充电器了   -给我让开
-Well maybe, you need to find the charger.   -Get out of the way

333
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,140
喔喔  住手
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

334
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,130
-寇格  你没事吧   -没事儿兄弟  好着呢
-Korg, you okay?   -Yeah, bro. All good.

335
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,490
各位  放松点
Alright. Everybody, just relax.

336
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,630
这些羊不会闹腾的
The goats are going to be fine.

337
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,090
闹的话  就把它们煎了吃肉
If not, we can just use them to meat.

338
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,290
见人  让它们见见人  它们挺会找话题的
...ting people... meeting people. They are great conversation starters.

339
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,970
还有  听说有一个特殊的口哨声可以召唤它们
And... been told you can summon them with a special whistle

340
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,080
大概是这么吹的
It goes something like this...

341
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,350
诶  不对
No, that's not it.

342
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,430
诶  不对
No, that's not it.

343
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,960
诶  不对  你试试
No, that's not it. You have a go.

344
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,390
诶 还是不对
No, that's not it.

345
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,550
-大家好啊   -克拉格林
-Oh! Hey, guys!   -Kraglin!

346
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,420
你一直都在这吗
You've been here, this whole time?

347
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,290
对啊  是你说待在船上
Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

348
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,330
这是格伦达  我们结婚了
This is Glenda. We're married.

349
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,500
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

350
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,100
闪婚这事我怎么跟你说的
What did I tell you about jumping into new relationships?

351
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,000
-说我不该这么做   -对啊
-That I shouldn't be doing that.   -Yeah!

352
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,200
你不能去个星球就娶个老婆
You can't get married on every single planet we land on.

353
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,580
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

354
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,460
可算好了
Finally!

355
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,930
来吧  求救信号
Alright, here we go. "Distress Calls".

356
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,450
救救我们  屠神者找到我们了
Please help us! The God Butcher has found us!

357
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,520
屠神者
God Butcher?

358
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,720
他留他们一口气当作警告
He left them hanging as a warning.

359
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,280
所有这些神都被杀了
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

360
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,280
我们最伟大的英雄们
Our greatest champions...

361
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,220
现已殒落
now laid to waste.

362
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,550
可怕
The horror.

363
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,180
谁能干出这种事啊
Who could have done something like this?

364
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,610
-索尔  你在哪   -等一下
-Thor, where are you?   -Wait, wait, wait.

365
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,050
刚才那是什么  往回倒一下
What was that? Go, go, go back.

366
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,250
放一下这个
Play that one.

367
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,980
索尔  你在哪里
Thor, where are you?

368
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,800
-希芙  -我们这里需要你
-Sif.   -We need you here.

369
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,780
我的朋友身处险境  我们必须马上赶过去
Well, my friend is in danger. We must go at once.

370
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,060
开船  兄弟们
Start the ship, my friends.

371
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,720
或许  我们应该分头行动
Oh. Maybe, we should split up.

372
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,530
我们要救太多人了
So many people to save, I mean.

373
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,460
看看这些求救...信号
Look at all these distress... calls.

374
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,240
索尔  你没问题吧
Thor, you're gonna be okay?

375
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,450
我很羡慕你们之间的关系  很美好
I admire your commitment to each other. It's a beautiful thing.

376
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,400
可惜  我永远与这美好无缘
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

377
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,390
兄弟  我能说一句吗
Buddy, if I may.

378
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,210
你说呗
You may.

379
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,450
都活了上千年  你好像还是不懂自己是谁
After thousands of years of living, you don't seem to know who the hell you are.

380
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,990
我也曾迷失过
I've been lost before.

381
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,980
后来我找到了人生的意义  遇见了真爱
Then I found meaning, I found love.

382
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,410
然后我痛失所爱  天哪真的很难过
And yeah, it got taken from me, and God, that hurts.

383
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,810
但那种蛋疼的感觉还是好过空虚
But that shitty feeling is better than feeling empty.

384
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,850
我希望将来在某一天  你会遇上
My hope for you is that one day, you will find something...

385
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,740
让你感到蛋疼的事情
to make you feel this shitty.

386
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,250
我曾经也爱过
I have loved before.

387
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,770
都没有结局
Didn't work out.

388
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,660
她们不是死得很惨就是写封信把你给甩了
They either die a brutal death or they dump you with the handwritten letter.

389
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,670
我不确定哪种更糟  所以我跟别人都保持一定距离
I don't know which is worse, which is why I keep everyone at arm's length.

390
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,900
我已经喜欢上你们了  可恶  我就知道会这样
I've grown too attached, damn it! I knew this would happen.

391
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,070
你们真的该走了
You must go!

392
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,440
我会去找希芙的
I'll find Sif.

393
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,980
你们去回应其他求救信号吧
You answer the other calls.

394
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,600
银河需要它的护卫队
The Galaxy needs its guardians.

395
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,130
-行  我们正准备走   -别说了  我知道分别很痛苦
-Cool, yeah. We were just leaving.   -Shhh! I know this hurts.

396
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,310
但这是最好的办法了  相信我
But it's better this way. You have to trust me.

397
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,790
为了缓解分别的痛苦  不如
To ease the pain, why don't you uh...

398
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,440
收下这艘飞船吧  就当是我送给你的分别礼物
Take the ship here, as a parting farewell gift.

399
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,870
你这是要把我的飞船送给我吗
Oh, you're giving me my ship?

400
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,570
没错  她是你的了
Yes, she's yours.

401
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,220
愿你像我一样  和她创造美好的回忆
May you make as many memories with her as I have.

402
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,210
她是个喜怒无常的老姑娘
She's a temperamental old lass.

403
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,500
但会帮助你脱离困境
Serve you well, in a tight pickle.

404
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,840
-我去发动飞船  -谢谢
-I'll start the ship?   -Thank you.

405
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,220
再见了  我的老朋友
Goodbye, old friend.

406
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,780
人类式握手
Human handshake.

407
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,960
阿斯加德式握手
to the Asgardian shake.

408
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,090
变成信不过的小蛇蛇
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

409
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,990
-你是真能拖   -最后是经典阿斯加德指尖对对碰
-Really dragging this out.   -Finish the classic Asgardian high one.

410
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,270
-我们走吧   -照顾好我的船员
-Let's go.   -Take care of my crew.

411
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,520
离开我  他们会很难受的
It's going to be hard for them.

412
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,620
-快点   -她不算
-Hurry up!   -Not her.

413
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,970
记住我跟你说的
Remember what I told you.

414
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,920
每当你感到迷茫的时候
You ever feel loss?

415
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,780
看着你所爱之人的眼睛
Just look into the eyes of the people that you love.

416
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,230
然后你就会知道自己是谁了
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

417
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,760
好了  拜拜
Alright, bye.

418
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,320
不管怎样  让我们铭记美好的回忆
For what it's worth, let's cling to the good memories.

419
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,530
阿斯加德有句俗语  "愿你如奥丁的渡鸦一般迅速前行"
We Asgardians say, "May you travel with the speed of Odin's ravens".

420
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,150
"当我们相聚英灵殿  我们将共饮美酒"
I'll see you in Valhalla where we shall drink mead.

421
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,310
他们走了
They're gone.

422
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,200
又是孤零零的我和你了
Alone again, just me and you.

423
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,190
暴风战斧
Stormbreaker!

424
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,990
小心点  你这要命的斧头
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

425
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,120
我们现在做什么  兄弟
So what do we do now, bro?

426
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,380
我们去救希芙
Let's go get Sif.

427
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,920
那是谁  或者什么东西
Who or what is that?

428
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,230
那是法利加  是法利加人的神
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

429
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,640
是最友好的神之一
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

430
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,070
噢不
Oh no.

431
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,810
希芙  是我  索尔
Sif! It's me, Thor.

432
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,150
奥丁森
Odinson.

433
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,520
你缺了一条胳膊
You're missing an arm.

434
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,740
我来带你回家
Let me get you home.

435
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,650
不
No!

436
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,900
把我留在这里吧
Leave me here.

437
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,990
我想以一名战士的身份死去
I want to die a warrior's death.

438
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,230
战死沙场  死在战斗中
On the battlefield, in battle.

439
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,190
然后我就能在英灵殿有一席之地了
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

440
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,350
这个  我也不想坏你美梦
Oh, I hate to break it to you.

441
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,130
但一个战士要是想去英灵殿的话
But for a warrior to get into Valhalla,

442
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,270
得在战斗的时候死去
you have to die in the battle.

443
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,680
-但现在你已经幸存下来了   -啊  该死
-You survived.   -Ah, shit!

444
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,950
说不定你的手臂已经在英灵殿了
Maybe, your arm is in Valhalla.

445
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,280
这里发生什么了
What happened here?

446
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,820
我一直追捕一个疯子
I've been hunting a mad man.

447
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,290
我跟着他来到了这里
I followed him here!

448
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,750
-但这是个陷阱   -这个疯子是谁
-It was a trap.  -Who is this mad man?

449
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,150
屠神者  他要来了
The God Butcher, he's coming.

450
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,750
他希望杀光众神
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

451
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,410
阿斯加德是他的下一个目标
Asgard is next.

452
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,890
-快看  是索尔  索尔   -快带希芙去医院
-Look, it's Thor! Thor!   -Take Sif to the infirmary.

453
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,760
你这次又招惹谁了
Hey! Who'd you piss off now?

454
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,450
这次不是我的错
It's not my fault.

455
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,530
我从来没见过这些玩意儿  鬼知道是谁
I've never even seen these things, whoever the hell they are.

456
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,570
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

457
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,510
那个新来的是谁
Who's the new guy?

458
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,020
那个家伙啊  你会喜欢的
That guy... You're gonna love that guy.

459
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,630
妙尔尼尔
Mjölnir.

460
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,910
妙尔尼尔
Mjölnir!

461
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,210
我是索尔啊
It's me, Thor.

462
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,550
你看到我的锤子了吗
Have you seen my hammer?

463
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,150
妙尔尼尔  快过来
Mjölnir, here boy.

464
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,840
妙尔尼尔
Mjölnir?

465
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,770
妙尔尼尔
Mjölnir.

466
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,050
你  回  来  了
You're back.

467
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,660
妙尔尼尔
Mjölnir!

468
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,940
打扰一下  你好
Excuse me. Hello.

469
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,660
你拿的是我的锤子
That's my hammer you got in there.

470
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
还用了我的装扮
and that's my look.

471
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,720
嘿
Hey!

472
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,850
够了别闹了
Enough tomfoolery.

473
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,120
把头盔摘了  让我看看你是谁
Take off that mask and reveal yourself.

474
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,930
快点
C'mon.

475
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,890
嗨
Hey.

476
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,640
简
Jane?!

477
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,950
让我来给你们讲讲索尔和简的传奇故事吧
Let me tell you the legend of Thor and Jane.

478
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,800
他是雷霆之神
He was a God of Thunder.

479
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,280
她是个女科学家
And she, a woman of science.

480
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,560
虽然他们来自不同的世界
And although they were from different worlds...

481
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,640
但不知怎么的  他们的感情水到渠成
Somehow, it just made sense.

482
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,030
于是他们一起踏上了爱情的旅途
And together, they embarked on the journey of love.

483
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,180
索尔教会了简战士的生活方式
Thor taught Jane, the way of the warrior.

484
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,130
而简教会了索尔人类的生活方式
And Jane taught Thor, the way of the people.

485
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,870
随着时间的流逝  他们的爱越来越深
And as time passed, their love grew deeper and deeper.

486
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,340
她太完美了  不是吗  妙尔尼尔
She's incredible. Isn't she, Mjölnir?

487
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,190
你得向我保证  你会一直保护她
I need you to promise me, you'll always protect her.

488
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,150
我也爱你  伙计
I love you too, buddy.

489
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,140
如此深厚的一份爱  在不知不觉中产生了魔力
A love that deep, has a way of becoming magical.

490
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,010
索尔计划起和简的未来  以为生活会一直如此
Thor set a path towards a future and thought it might hold.

491
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,440
但他计划得越多  就越害怕失去这种生活
But the more he pondered a life with Jane, the more he feared losing that life.

492
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,900
虽然简不愿意承认
And although Jane didn't want to admit it,

493
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,100
她也同样害怕失去
she was scared of loss as well.

494
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,220
所以  他们之间出现了隔阂
And so, they built walls between them.

495
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,470
索尔忙着拯救人类
Thor got busy, saving humanity.

496
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

497
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,120
简也忙着做一样的事
Jane got busy, doing the same.

498
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,150
非常繁忙
Real busy.

499
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,850
最终  他们之间的隔阂越来越大
And eventually, the space between them grew and grew

500
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,040
直到他们无法忍受
Until it became too wide to bear.

501
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,300
这段感情进入了僵局
Some things had to give.

502
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,360
我得通宵工作来整理数据
I have to stay up all night, then go through this data.

503
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,590
我也得通宵...把这些都收拾干净
Well I have to stay up all night cleaning all of this up.

504
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,730
-不过就两个盘子   -是两个盘子和两把叉子
-There's two plates!   -It's two plates and two forks!

505
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,980
直到一天晚上  这段感情走向了终点
And then one night, it didn't give.

506
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,020
简写了一张留言
Jane wrote a note.

507
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,120
索尔读了那条留言
And Thor read that note.

508
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,920
他们的传奇忽然就变成了虚构的传说
And their legend suddenly became myth.

509
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,860
至少他们是这么认为的
Or so they thought.

510
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,920
你还好吗
You okay?

511
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,420
嗯
Yes.

512
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,120
有点热
It's a little hot in...

513
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,260
就是感觉  戴着头盔
Startin' to feel...

514
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,080
都快得幽闭恐惧症了
Bit claustrophobic with the helmet.

515
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,410
这怎么可能
How?!

516
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,120
我们能一会儿再说吗
Can we talk about this later?

517
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,150
哦  好啊
Yeah, sure.

518
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,790
很高兴见到你
Great seeing you!

519
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,580
搞什么啊
What?!

520
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,160
屠戮众神
Kill all the gods.

521
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,920
嘿  那是黑死剑吗
Hey! Is that the Necrosword?

522
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,430
太酷了  我只在故事里读到过
That's cool. I've only ever read about it in stories.

523
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,820
那你就该知道  接下来会很痛
Then, you know this is going to hurt.

524
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,150
痛苦
Pain.

525
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,470
痛苦不过是弱者编出来的东西
What is pain, but a construct invented by the weak.

526
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,140
哦  还真挺痛
Oh, okay! That's very sharp!

527
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,580
准备好了吗
Ready?

528
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,550
别碰我的东西
Don't touch my things.

529
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,560
逃命去吧  你个懦夫
You better run, you coward.

530
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,120
孩子  他们带走了孩子
The children! They're taking the children!

531
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,390
-妈妈   -妈妈
-Mommy!   -Mommy!

532
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,720
影子恶魔  真是恶心
Shadow monsters, disgusting.

533
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,810
围着地球飞两圈了  什么都没找到
Flew around the world twice, nothing.

534
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,520
那帮懦夫肯定跑了  我们会找到他们的
Cowards must have run away. We'll find them.

535
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,710
-真是别开生面的重逢   -你说呢
-Quite a reunion, huh?   -Ah, you're telling me.

536
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,870
我们多久没见了  三四年吗
What's it been like? Three, four years?

537
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,350
八年七个月零六天
Eight years, seven months and six days.

538
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,550
我可没忘
I haven't forgotten.

539
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,480
我上次见你  或者说上次没见到你  因为你离开了
The last time I saw you or didn't see you, because you left.

540
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,780
我离开了  真是个极简的说法
Kind of an oversimplification to say that I left.

541
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,020
你离开了  本来就是
Ah, no, you left. You did.

542
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,360
你给我写了封很漂亮的手写信
You wrote me a beautiful handwritten letter.

543
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,420
我当时在那儿  我应该知道的
I should know, I was there.

544
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,700
-事实上你不在   -我在
-You weren't there, actually.   -I was.

545
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,140
因此  关于留言
Hence, the note...

546
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,570
并且如果你没在那儿看着我走  说不定走的人是你
And if you weren't there to see me leave, then maybe it was you that left.

547
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
有道理
Fair point.

548
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,070
-倒不是说这有多重要  或是...  -不
-Not that it matters, like...  -No.

549
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,600
-就是理下时间线  好吗  -好啊
-Just keeping track, right?  -Yeah.

550
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,290
不如说我们同时分手和被分手
I supposed we both left and both got left.

551
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,010
你现在又要走了
Now, you're leaving again.

552
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,430
米埃克  我需要所有目击者提供详细信息
Miek, we need detailed accounts from all the witnesses.

553
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,220
达瑞尔  去整理失踪孩子的名单
Darryl, get all the names of the children who've been lost.

554
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,010
陛下  我的女儿被带走了  我不知道她在哪
Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken, and I don't know where she is.

555
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,570
我们会找到她的
And she'll be found.

556
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,480
伙计们  他们在流血  带人去医院  快
Guys, they're bleeding! Get them to the infirmary, now!

557
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,300
-达瑞尔   -陛下
-Darryl!   -Majesty.

558
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,640
我们要为这一团糟准备个表演吗
Should we start working on a performance of this entire debacle?

559
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,250
大家需要找点乐子
People need entertainment.

560
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,190
特别现在这种危急的时刻
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

561
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,240
特别是现在
Particularly.

562
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,150
我没听见她说不
I did not hear a "no".

563
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,720
真巧  我也是
Nor did I.

564
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,100
阿斯加德  晚上见
Asgard, at night.

565
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,760
我们开幕先演熟睡的小孩
We open on some sleeping children.

566
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,330
前女友  是吧
So that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

567
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,550
-曾经的前女友   -朱迪·福斯特吗
-The old ex-girlfriend.   -Jodie Foster.

568
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,350
-简·福斯特   -跑了的那个
-Jane Foster.   -The one that got away.

569
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,520
跑了的那个
The one that got away.

570
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,400
-也就是逃走   -嗯嗯
-That means escaped.   -Yeah.

571
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,950
没错
Yeah.

572
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,890
看见你的前女友和你的前战锤
Must be hard for you to see your ex-girlfriend

573
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,140
并肩作战  关系还挺好  你一定很难过
and your ex-hammer hanging out and getting on so well.

574
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,430
你干嘛呢  兄弟
What you up to, bro?

575
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,490
快点
Come on.

576
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,320
到老爸手里来
Come to daddy.

577
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
快点  妙尔尼尔
Come on, Mjölnir.

578
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,130
你在这啊
Hey, there you are!

579
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,200
你好啊
Hey!

580
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,760
-你知道我觉得我们应该怎么做吗   -我正在叫你呢
-Do you know what I think we should do?   -I was just calling you.

581
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,870
建立一支军队
Start an army.

582
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,600
用什么建
With what?

583
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,810
-我们刚死了一半士兵  -有一半总是死的
-Half our soldiers are dead.  -Half our soldiers are always dead.

584
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,610
-所有人回家吧   -孩子们在哪里
-Everyone, please. Go home.   -Where are the children?

585
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,090
我保证很快就会通知你们
I promise you will have news soon.

586
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,370
得有人告诉我们发生了什么
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

587
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,800
我们会找到他们的
We shall find them.

588
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,310
-我就是不明白  -你知道吗
-I just don't understand.   -You know what?

589
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,610
这全是我们的错
This is all our fault.

590
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,120
别吵了
Stop it!

591
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,260
阿斯加德
Asgard!

592
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,390
朋友们  我们不能内斗
My friends, we must not quarrel.

593
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,570
危急时刻  我们要团结一致  共同战斗
Times like this, we need to unite and come together.

594
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,700
我明白现在是什么情况
I see what's happening here.

595
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,550
你们很害怕
You're afraid.

596
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,160
对吧
Hm?

597
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,230
恐惧
Scared.

598
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,040
害怕
Afraid.

599
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,130
焦虑
Anxious.

600
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,090
如果我们想找到孩子  就必须先扪心自问
If we are to find the children, we must first look within ourselves.

601
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,210
抱歉  米埃克
I'm sorry, Miek.

602
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,770
你一直弄出嗡嗡的噪音  我没法鼓舞军心了
It's very hard to give a rousing speech with the eh-eh-eh noise.

603
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,450
你在干什么
What are you doing?

604
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,860
-她在做会议记录   -哪有时间做什么记录
-She's taking minutes.   -Well, precious minutes we don't have.

605
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,710
想让孩子们回来吗
Want the kids back?

606
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,820
我去去就回
I'll be back in a moment.

607
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,890
米埃克  记下来
You can write that down, Miek.

608
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,730
不
No!

609
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,260
暴风战斧  你干嘛
Stormbreaker, what are you doing?

610
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,070
是因为妙尔尼尔吗
Is this about Mjölnir?

611
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,200
所有人  立刻出去
Everyone out!

612
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,080
没找到人
Didn't find 'em.

613
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,410
你的斗篷着火了
Your cape is on fire.

614
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,490
没事  它会自己长回来的
It's fine, it'll grow back.

615
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,290
我会跟你要维修费的
I'm invoicing you for this.

616
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,130
听着
Listen.

617
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,320
关于这家伙  我们知道什么
What do we know about this guy?

618
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,690
他在暗影中穿行
He travels through shadows.

619
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,230
还借助影子创造影怪物
And he creates monsters with them.

620
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,040
没错  可怕的怪物
Absolutely, freaky monsters.

621
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,430
他手中还有黑死剑
Also wields the Necrosword.

622
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,150
你问我怎么知道的
How do I know that?

623
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,580
因为他差点用这玩意把我脸捅了
Because he almost speared me in the face with it.

624
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,660
黑死剑是什么
What's a Necrosword?

625
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,960
它是上古兵器  自古流传到现在  经手多任主人
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed through hands, since the dawn of time.

626
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,190
它拥有屠神的能力
It has the ability to slay gods.

627
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,260
它会不断腐化它的主人  最后弑主  也就是说
It slowly corrupts and kills whoever wields it, which means...

628
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,990
-所以黑死剑感染了他   -感染  对  就是这样
-Oh, so it infected him.   -It's infecting him. Yes, it must be.

629
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,260
所以我们要对付一个被诅咒的影子僵尸绑匪
So basically, we're up against a cursed shadow, zombie kidnapper.

630
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,860
很好  我们什么时候出发
Awesome! When do we leave?

631
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,950
索尔
Thor?

632
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,720
你能看见我吗
Can you see me?

633
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,770
警报  有个飘着的头
Uh, floating head alert.

634
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,960
是阿斯特德
It's Astrid.

635
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,330
海姆达尔之子
Heimdallson.

636
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,050
阿斯特德  你们没事吧
Astrid, are you okay?

637
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,020
我早就不叫阿斯特德了
I no longer go by the name, Astrid.

638
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,400
我现在叫艾克索
I'm now known as Axl.

639
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,670
他是地球上一个流行乐队的主唱
He's a singer from a popular band I heard on Earth.

640
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,480
枪炮玫瑰
GNR.

641
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,120
阿斯特德
Astrid...

642
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,620
你父亲为你起了个非常维京的名字  我要尊重他的想法
Your father gave you a very tough Viking name and I intend to honor his wishes.

643
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,870
-艾克索   -阿斯特德
-Axl.   -Astrid.

644
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,180
-我说艾克索  -阿斯特德
-I said, Axl.  -Astrid.

645
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,790
-艾克索  -叫混蛋行了吧  你就听他说吧
-Axl!  -It's Asshole! Now, listen to him.

646
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,650
行吧  艾克索
Alright, fine. "Axl"...

647
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,700
-你们现在在哪儿   -我不知道
-Where are you?   -I'm not sure.

648
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,290
我还不会使用我眼睛的能力
I don't know how to use my magic eyes yet.

649
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,000
你父亲教过我  我可以教给你
Your father told me and I'm here to teach you.

650
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,520
我需要你集中精神  伸出你的手
I need you to focus and hold out your hand.

651
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,880
很好
Okay, good.

652
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,770
现在思想集中  闭上双眼
Now, focus. Close your eyes.

653
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,570
索尔
Thor!

654
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,190
嘿孩子们  你们还好吗
Hey! How's it going, kids?

655
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,890
你问我们还好吗  瞧瞧我们现在在哪儿
How's it going? Look where we are.

656
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,190
我们在一个到处是刺的牢笼里
We're in a cage made of spikes.

657
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,540
啊对  是不太好
Yeah, that's right. Not good.

658
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,270
-你会做点什么吗   -对  会的
-You gonna do something?   -Yes. Yes, I am.

659
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,100
但不是现在  我现在就是个幻像  你们看
But just not right now. I'm the vision ghost, look.

660
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,390
-看到了吧   -我们会怎么样
-See.   -What will happen to us?

661
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,130
谁知道呢  我是说  现在的情况非常非常糟糕
Who can tell? I mean, this is a very, very bad situation.

662
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,770
但好消息是  作为阿斯加德人
You know, the good news is, you're Asgardian.

663
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,010
你们死后会进入英灵殿
So if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

664
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,370
我的天啊  闭嘴吧
Oh, my God, go away.

665
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,560
等等  等等  听着
Wait, wait. Listen.

666
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,560
好吧  没关系的  孩子们  别哭  别哭  没事的
Okay. It's all right, children. Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

667
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,050
听着  我有一个计划
Listen, I got a plan, okay?

668
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,100
我正在组建一支非常非常厉害的队伍
I'm putting together a really, really good team.

669
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,450
我们有...
We've got um, uh...

670
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,810
寇格叔叔
Uncle Korg.

671
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,000
女武神陛下
King Valkyrie.

672
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,820
对...
Um, yeah...

673
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,730
我的前女友简  这事太复杂我就不多说了  好吧
My ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole 'nother story I won't bore you with, okay?

674
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,920
但这是支一流的小队  你们肯定还没反应过来就已经回家了
But it is a top notch team, and we're gonna have you home before you know it.

675
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,790
没错
Yeah.

676
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,430
我知道你们在哪了
I know where you are.

677
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,930
我会救你们出去的
I'm gonna get you out of here.

678
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,360
我很害怕
I'm scared.

679
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,250
我们都很害怕
We all are.

680
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,160
索尔  索尔  救救我们
Thor! Thor! Save us.

681
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
让我离开这  你保重  好吗
Get me out of here. You take care, okay?

682
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,300
照顾好自己  再见了  好吗
Take care. I'll see you soon. All right?

683
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,650
艾克索  让我离开这里
Axl, get me out of here!

684
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,510
他们在暗影维度
They're in the Shadow Realm.

685
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,760
你怎么知道
How do you know?

686
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,330
那里的黑暗不同寻常
The atmosphere there has a darkness like no other.

687
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,620
仿佛没有任何色彩  肯定没有错
As if color refused to tread. It's unmistakable.

688
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,860
好吧  如果需要的是色彩
Well then, if it's color we need.

689
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,610
那我们带点彩虹吧
Let's bring the rainbow.

690
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,730
带点彩虹  这是一句口号还是什么
Bring the rainbow? Is that a catchphrase or something?

691
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,430
她才成为雷神没多久
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

692
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,330
她是很擅长救人  但其他方面还有待提升
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at. But the rest, she needs work.

693
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,170
-她创造多少口号了   -很多
-How many catchphrases have there been?   -A lot.

694
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,580
是我操之过急了
Yep, jumped the gun.

695
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,860
等等  他能在影子中移动  他又要去暗影维度
Hang on, he moves through shadows and he's going to the shadow realm.

696
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,620
他在那里不就是最强的吗
It seems like that's where he's going to be the most powerful.

697
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,220
你说得对  我们不能贸然前往
You're right. We can't just go launching in there.

698
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,310
可能是陷阱  也有可能让孩子们陷入危险
Could be a trap. Could be endangering the children.

699
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,330
我们需要增援  我们应该组建一支军队
We need reinforcements. We should raise an army.

700
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,640
你跟我想到一块儿去了吗
Are you thinking what I think you're thinking?

701
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,130
-我在想   -在想什么
-I'm thinking it.   -What are we thinking?

702
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,220
-想什么   -我也在想
-Thinking what?   -I'm thinking it too.

703
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,650
全能之城 
Omnipotent City.

704
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,800
什么是全能之城
What's Omnipotent City?

705
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,110
那里住着全宇宙最强大的神明
It's the home of the most powerful gods of the universe.

706
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,130
我们可以组建起一支前所未有的无敌战队
We can put together the greatest team ever.

707
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,740
我们可以找拉神  赫拉克勒斯  图玛陶恩加...
We can recruit Ra, Hercules, Tūmatauenga...

708
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,170
可能还有羽蛇神克察尔科阿特尔
Quetzalcóatl, maybe.

709
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,920
还有宙斯  最年长最智慧的神
And Zeus, the oldest and wisest of them all.

710
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,660
-你刚刚说宙斯吗   -对  宙斯
-Did you say, Zeus?   -Yes, Zeus.

711
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,280
宙斯  宙斯本人
Like the Zeus. Zeus Zeus.

712
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,590
没听说他还有别的名字
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

713
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,740
你觉得我的神会在那儿吗  石人尼尼
You think my god will be there? Ninny of the Nonny.

714
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,790
一切皆有可能  寇格...
Well, you never know, Korg...

715
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,450
但如果他们在  我们就邀请他们加入小队
But if they are, we'll ask them to join our team.

716
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,160
好耶
Yes!

717
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,060
暴风战斧
Stormbreaker.

718
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,060
冷静  放轻松
Calm down, relax.

719
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:09,770
不不不  兄弟
No, no, no, mate.

720
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,010
暴风战斧的彩虹桥太不稳定了  我们才不走
We are not traveling on Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

721
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,130
你自己看看刚才什么情况
Look what just happened.

722
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,000
那我们也不能骑着你的小马过去吧
We can't exactly go in your tiny little flying portal horse, can we?

723
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,330
-坐不下这么多人  -你说什么鬼话
-We won't all fit.   -What are you talking about?

724
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,140
我的战歌超级棒
Warsong's awesome.

725
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,500
我的暴风战斧也很棒
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

726
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,860
暴风战斧只是需要一个媒介
Stormbreaker just needs a conduit.

727
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,690
任何能够遭得住太空旅行的东西都行
Anything that can handle space travel.

728
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,930
我就喜欢听她讲科学
I love when she talks shop.

729
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,440
战斧的力量可以带我们过去
It has the power to get us there.

730
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,820
就是需要什么东西帮它把能量聚集起来
Just need something to focus that energy,

731
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,100
这样就不会那么...不稳定
so it's not so... unpredictable.

732
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:29,820
你懂的
You know, uh.

733
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,710
如果我们有船  就能把暴风战斧作为能量源坐船走
If we had a ship, we could harness it and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

734
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,920
就像引擎一样
Ooh, like an engine.

735
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,850
-就像引擎   -你们需要船吗
-Like an engine.   -You need a ship?

736
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,150
我有船
I got a ship.

737
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,000
把座椅都拿下去
Throw all those seats.

738
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,490
还有你们几个  去把羊绑在船头
And you guys, go tie those goats to the front.

739
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,040
我们十五分钟后出发
We leave in 15 minutes.

740
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,820
所有人注意  只带必需品
Essentials only, everyone.

741
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,110
那是必需品
That's essential.

742
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,130
你很快就把我忘了  对吧
Well you moved on quick, didn't you.

743
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,730
你真厉害啊
You are some piece of work.

744
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,530
-哦  嘿   -你好
-Oh, hey!   -Hey.

745
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,490
-我过来和老朋友叙叙旧   -嗯
-Catching up with an old friend.   -Yeah.

746
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,550
我一直想对你说声抱歉
I've been meaning to apologize.

747
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,050
之前表现得有些奇怪
Sort of acting a little weird before.

748
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,390
我最近一段时间有点迷失自我了  你懂的
I just haven't really been myself lately. You know, kind of...

749
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:13,480
试图找回真正的自我  不过有点迷惘
trying to figure out who I am and uh, just felt a little bit lost.

750
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,740
然后突然之间  我看到了你  打扮成了我的样子
And then all of a sudden, I see you, dressed as me.

751
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,560
这可真是...
And it's been kinda...

752
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,660
这对我来说也挺难以置信的
It's a lot for me, too.

753
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,900
所以你是怎么...
So how did uh...

754
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,870
和战锤相遇的
you guys get together?

755
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,110
发生了什么事
How did this happen?

756
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,900
说真的  我听到妙尔尼尔在呼唤我
I swear, I heard Mjölnir call to me.

757
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,080
哇哦  是嘛
Ah, did it?

758
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,070
所以我来这里调查  然后...
And so I came here to investigate and...

759
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,900
那些碎片就开始躁动发光了...
Pieces started glowing and swirling...

760
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,840
-离谱   -然后我就成了雷神   
-and then Thor.   -Crazy.

761
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,360
不过你这么穿很棒  很适合...
Well, you know what. It looks good on you. It works, so...

762
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,090
就是试试
Just checking.

763
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,270
回头见
See you later.

764
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,640
五分钟后启程
Five minutes to departure!

765
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,390
怎么了嘛
What?

766
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,380
只是聊聊而已
We were just talking.

767
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,810
别丢下我  妈妈
Mommy, don't leave me.

768
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,980
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

769
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,140
亲爱的  即使我不在
Even when I'm gone, honey.

770
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,780
你也不会孤单的
You won't be alone.

771
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,750
无论发生什么
And whatever happens...

772
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,450
一定要勇往直前
Never stop fighting.

773
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,180
一定要勇往直前
Never stop fighting.

774
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,650
-嘿  -你还好吗
-Hey.  -You alright?

775
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,970
我很好
Great!

776
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,700
水池可能不这么认为
The sink would say otherwise.

777
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,160
你真的觉得我该去吗
You think I really should be coming?

778
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,790
我的身体没有任何好转
I'm not getting any better.

779
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,900
你是雷神  当然该去了
You're a Thor. Of course, you should come.

780
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,350
再说  不然你还能干什么
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

781
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,940
你是个维京战士了
You're a Viking now.

782
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,040
这意味着你最好战死沙场
Means you pretty much have to die in battle.

783
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,330
而且最好特别痛苦
It needs to be devastatingly painful.

784
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,270
不然可进不了英灵殿
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

785
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,060
这就是我的计划
That's my plan.

786
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,070
你的王国和子民怎么办
What about you know kinging and stuff?

787
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,660
我喜欢做国王的感觉
I love being king.

788
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,630
我也深爱着我的人民
I love my people.

789
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,270
但基本就是开开会  飞鸦传书罢了
But it's all meeting and raven mail.

790
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,050
而且会议可能也就是飞鸦传书
And meetings that could have been raven mail.

791
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,440
我太怀念战斗了
I miss fighting.

792
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,740
也很想念我的姐妹们
I miss my sisters,

793
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,150
所以你必须去  因为我需要你做我的姐妹
which is why you need to come because I need one.

794
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,860
好啦  该走了  你收拾好了吗
Okay, we should go. You packed?

795
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:27,900
你呢
Are you packed?

796
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,430
好了
Yes.

797
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,130
手雷吗
A hand grenade?

798
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,750
不是  这是便携小音箱
No, it's a portable speaker.

799
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,100
走吧
Let's go.

800
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,540
要是你不介意帮我保密水池的事...
If you don't mind keeping the sink thing under wraps.

801
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,570
我会帮你保密
I got you.

802
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,270
我的阿斯加德子民们...
My fellow Asgardians...

803
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,200
祝我们好运吧
Wish us well.

804
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,320
我们会如同奥丁的渡鸦一般迅速前行
For we shall travel with the speed of Odin's ravens.

805
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,280
我们会带着孩子们归来
We will return with children.

806
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:03,980
许多许多的孩子
Many children.

807
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,970
然后我们就召开盛宴
Then we should feast.

808
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,900
不是吃孩子哈
Not on the children.

809
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,850
现在我们不这么干了
We do not do that anymore.

810
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,460
那是一段黑暗的时代...
It was dark times.

811
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,210
耻辱的时代
Shameful time.

812
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,520
好  我们该出发了
Okay, we should go.

813
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,970
你...最近还在溜冰吗
So... Still rollerblading?

814
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,780
没有了  你呢
No, no. You?

815
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,150
每周末我都去
Oh yeah, every weekend.

816
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,530
一旦开始溜冰  那可停不下来
Once you blade, you never fade.

817
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,280
-对吧  寇格   -一朝上冰场  永世好兄弟
-Right, Korg?   -Skate twins for life.

818
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,840
嘿  能跟你商量点事吗
Hey, can I run something by you?

819
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:11,610
好啊
Yeah.

820
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,810
我就在想  等我们遇到了坏人...
So I was thinking, when we get to the bad guy...

821
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,460
我能不能造点口号  比如说...
What about if I had, like, the cool catchphrase, like...

822
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,800
"吃我一锤  啪"
"Eat this hammer, bang!"

823
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,170
或者
Or like?

824
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,260
"给我瞧好了  嘭"
"Check out my hammer, boom!"

825
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,830
或者...
Like, what about...

826
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,960
不...我最近绞尽脑汁在想这些
No...I'm workshopping it.

827
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,490
我觉得非常酷  我的话就是...
No, they... They're all really good. Mine is uh...

828
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,140
"此时此地就做个了断"
"This ends here and now."

829
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,740
这句真不错
Oh, that's such a good one.

830
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,080
我花了好久来打磨这句话
Took me a long time to perfect it.

831
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,540
你也可以的  只要多练习就好了
You'll get there. You just need to practice.

832
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,080
这是我第一次对付恶人
This is my first bad guy.

833
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,380
第一次总是最难忘
You never forget your first.

834
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,360
是啊
Yeah.

835
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,190
你有女朋友了嘛
So you got a girlfriend?

836
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,820
哦不  没有
Oh, no, no.

837
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,240
我太忙了  没时间  你知道的...
Too busy. Don't have time. You know, just...

838
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,200
有工作和其他一堆事要处理
With work and everything.

839
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:51,030
好吧
Cool.

840
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,230
让我检查一下这个地方
Let me check this place out.

841
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:57,980
太酷了
So cool.

842
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,280
谁太酷了
Who's so cool?

843
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,250
我说这些建筑物
The buildings are cool.

844
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,380
发生了什么
What's happening there?

845
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,180
-啥   -我似乎...
-Where?   -Am I, uh...

846
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,830
感觉到来电了
Sensing feelings?

847
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,630
什么来电  对简吗
Feelings, what? For Jane?

848
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,450
-对啊   -你可别瞎说什么来电了
-Yeah.   -No, don't be ridiculous with feelings.

849
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,750
上次我俩来电都已经是很久很久以前了  我觉得你...
The last time we had feelings were long time ago. Long, long gone. I think you...

850
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,590
-也许来电的人是你   -对对对
-Maybe you have feelings.   -Right.

851
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,770
-兄弟别慌  咱俩一伙的   -我不知道
-Mate, relax. We're on the same team.   -I don't know.

852
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,180
我很清楚咱们在哪伙中  好吗
Know exactly what team we're on, okay？

853
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,240
在简的那伙
Team Jane.

854
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,330
索尔永远都能重新振作起来
Thing about Thor is that he always bounces back.

855
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,170
-对   -比如说  当时海拉毁了他的锤子
-Yeah.   -Like when Hela stole his hammer, he went and built an ax

856
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,390
他就在死星的核心中造出一把斧子
which is forged in the heart of a dying star.

857
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,240
他就是用这把斧子砍下了灭霸的头
And with the same ax, he used to cut off Thano's head.

858
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,760
讲的不错
That's a good one.

859
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,070
这故事真不赖啊
What a neat story!

860
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,900
既然你们谈到了砍头这事...
Oh, with all this talk about chopping off heads...

861
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,260
我还真想试试
I wanna have a go.

862
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:56,780
这是什么
What's this?

863
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,530
哦...
Oh...

864
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,380
哇哦哇哦...
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho...

865
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,800
啊嗷
Oh.

866
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,130
这位是奥克提
This is Octy.

867
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,540
你好哇  奥克提
Hello, Harpy.

868
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,580
最近过得如何啊
How are you?

869
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,540
你们知道奥克提喜欢什么吗
Do you know what Harpy loves?

870
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,160
他喜欢身首分离
Having his head ripped off.

871
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,260
怎么了  刚刚你们还挺喜欢砍头的啊
What? You liked it a second ago.

872
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,600
好吧  好吧  好吧
Alright. Alright, alright.

873
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,890
不要奥克提了
Harpy's gone.

874
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,330
-嘘  安静点   -我好害怕
-Come on. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.   -I'm scared.

875
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,260
这位小朋友
Look at you.

876
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,740
我曾经认识一个很像你的小姑娘
I knew a little girl, just like you.

877
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:38,570
她既勇敢又机灵
And she was brave. And she was smart...

878
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,790
还很风趣
And funny.

879
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,950
对了  她还喜欢画画
And, she liked to draw.

880
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,720
问你一个关于神的
Let me ask you a question...

881
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,740
问题
About gods.

882
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,790
他们本该保护你们的  不是吗
They're meant to protect you, right?

883
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:55,760
那他们在哪儿呢
Well, where are they?

884
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,720
-索尔正在赶来  -没错
-Thor is on his way.   -Yeah!

885
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,140
很好
Yes...

886
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,110
我就等着他来呢
I'm counting on that.

887
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,270
不然我干嘛要抓你们
That's why you're here.

888
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,640
这里是非请勿入的  所以我们要低调地混进去
It's invitation only, so we're gonna have to keep a low profile and blend in.

889
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,510
幸运的是  我很擅长伪装
Luckily, disguises are my speciality.

890
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,980
希腊哲学家
Greek philosopher?

891
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,210
我弄来了这些
Got us these.

892
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,360
那都是啥
What are those?

893
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,090
真正的伪装
Actual disguises.

894
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,300
几位情绪之神的斗篷
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

895
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,130
每种颜色代表不同的情感
Every color signifies different emotions.

896
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:29,580
-情绪之神都去哪了   -最好别问
-Where are the emotion gods?   -Hm, don't ask.

897
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,480
噢天哪
Holy shit.

898
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,470
孩子们  欢迎来到金色殿堂
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

899
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,500
宇宙中最强造物神的聚集地
This is where the most powerful creator gods in the universe hang out.

900
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,480
这里有魔法之神
There's the god of magic.

901
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,360
梦神
God of dreams.

902
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:56,360
木工之神
God of carpentry.

903
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,970
你们看那位
Ah, look at that one.

904
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
那是包包  饺子之神
Ah, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

905
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,890
-嘿  包包   -包
-Pst! Hey, Bao.   -Bao!

906
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,240
看上面  各位
Look up there, guys!

907
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,610
那是石头人的神  石人尼尼
The Kronan god, Ninny of the Nonny.

908
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:08,090
嘿  我是石人尼尼
Hey, Ninny Nonny.

909
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:29,870
宙斯  宙斯  宙斯
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

910
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,990
对
Yes.

911
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,000
宙斯来也
I am Zeus!

912
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,660
他来了
Oh, there he is!

913
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,790
那个男人  那个神话  那个传奇
The man, the myth, the legend.

914
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,350
不知道你们发现了没  我从他身上学了很多
Oh, I don't know if you know this, but I based a lot of what I do on this guy.

915
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,200
他就是闪电之神  我是雷霆之神
He's the god of lightning and I am the god of thunder.

916
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,820
我的灵感来源
Huge source of inspiration.

917
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,620
真不错
That's really good.

918
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,540
一会儿找他搬救兵的时候记得先提这事儿
You should lead with that when you ask him for an army.

919
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,030
但我们怎么上去
Um, how do we get up there?

920
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,430
用飞的吗
We should like, fly?

921
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,060
我们不能打断他的登场
Well, we can't interrupt him in the middle of his entrance.

922
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,790
他最有名的就是登场仪式
He's famous for his entrances.

923
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,590
雷霆霹雳  雷霆霹雳
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

924
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,710
好耶
Yes!

925
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,100
宙斯

926
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:37,480
好棒  雷霆霹雳
Yes! Thunderbolt!

927
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,680
秩序
Order.

928
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,030
秩序
Order!

929
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,930
安静
Silence.

930
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,680
安静
Silence!

931
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,550
我在此开启
I hereby open...

932
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,270
诸神的神圣议会
this holy council of the gods.

933
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,230
我们有很多庄严的议题
Where we have many, many serious matters...

934
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,030
要讨论
To be talked about.

935
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,020
比如
Such as...

936
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,130
今年的狂欢盛宴在哪里开
Where are we going to hold this year's orgy?

937
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,360
这家伙认真的吗
Is this guy for real?

938
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,580
讲真的  我没生气
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

939
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,360
对  我相信他说得有道理  好吗
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

940
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,080
-接下来我们要公布  -抱歉
-So now we're going to announce...   -Sorry.

941
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:25,680
以神之名献祭人类灵魂最多的赢家
The winner of the most human souls sacrificed in the name of a god.

942
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,200
好吧  可能他没那么好
Yeah, okay. Maybe, he's not that great.

943
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,540
确实不怎么好
Oh, no, not good.

944
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,490
不  我觉得接下来也不会有什么更好的话题
No, I don't think it's going to get any better than this.

945
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,070
这些神帮不上什么忙
And look, these gods aren't gonna help.

946
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,840
但是那个雷霆霹雳应该对我们有用
But that thunderbolt, I think that might be of use.

947
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,990
简走右路  索尔走左路
Jane, you go right. Thor, you go left.

948
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,350
我们冲上去  把那玩意抢走就完事儿
We bum-rush him, take the bolt, ding dong.

949
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,630
-好  动手吧  -不不不
-All right, let's go get it.   -No, no, no, no, no.

950
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,420
我们不偷也不抢
There's no ding donging or bum-rushing.

951
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,110
更别说是抢宙斯了
Especially not, Zeus's bum.

952
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,920
等时机一到我就会和他谈谈
When the time is right, I'm gonna talk to him.

953
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,800
时机已到
Time is right now.

954
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,400
-时机还没到   -谁在讲话
-Time is not right now.   -Who is talking?

955
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:51,660
谁在交头接耳呢
Who is talking?!

956
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,220
-就是他们   -寇格闭嘴
-These guys!   -Korg, shut up.

957
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,960
你们几个对大家有话要说吗
You guys have something to say to the group?

958
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,140
对不起
Sorry.

959
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,980
一分钟后我就要上去敲他脑壳了  有话快讲
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds, so speak fast.

960
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,240
字面意义上的敲脑壳
Literally, heads will roll.

961
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,470
士别三日  你们面目全非
Who are you two?

962
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,050
您好
Hello!

963
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:08,520
首先我要说  能来参会
Uh, let me be the first to say it is an honor and a privilege...

964
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,910
-是至高的荣誉   -我听不清
-to be here.   -No, I can't hear you.

965
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,730
你不如来台上说
Why don't you take the stage?

966
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,390
那里的讲台吗
The stage, down there?

967
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:17,730
对啊  你看到那块很像舞台的区域了吗
Well, yes. You see the area that looks very much like a stage?

968
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,230
明白了
Gotcha.

969
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,420
借过一下
Coming through.

970
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,830
抱歉抱歉
Oops, sorry.

971
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:31,980
祝你好运  哥们儿
Good luck, bro!

972
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,990
神威宙斯  哇哦
Mighty Zeus! Heh, wow!

973
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,510
还有宇宙诸神
Gods of the universe.

974
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,570
我是来求助的  我要组建一支军团
I come here to ask for help, to raise an army.

975
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,460
有一个名叫屠神者的疯子  正准备把我们都干掉
There's a maniac, called the God Butcher, which seeks to end us all.

976
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,690
他四处征伐
His destruction is everywhere.

977
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,950
许多星球和国度已经彻底失守
Entire planets, realms, have been left completely unprotected.

978
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,300
他所过之处一片狼藉
There's nothing but chaos in his way.

979
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,820
但我知道他在哪
But I know where he is.

980
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,160
只要诸位肯帮忙
With your help...

981
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,530
我们就能赶在他杀害其他神之前终结他
We can crush him before he kills anyone else.

982
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,910
那家伙啊
That guy.

983
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,040
杀了几个低等小神而已
He killed a couple of low-level gods.

984
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,510
多大点事儿
Eh, boo-hoo.

985
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,170
小帅哥  如果你没别的要说了
If that's all, pretty boy...

986
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,990
就回到座位上安静点吧
You go back to your seat and you be quiet.

987
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,180
抱歉  您听见我刚说的话了没有
Um, yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not hear any of what I just said?

988
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,350
他在四处屠杀
He's, he's murdering on mass.

989
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:24,510
这话我只想说一次
I tell you, one time.

990
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,720
你现在闭嘴
Now, you shut up.

991
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,760
悄悄地
You'll be quiet.

992
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,810
你离我把你赶出盛宴只差这么一点了
Because you are this close to being uninvited to the orgy.

993
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,220
宙斯  我们应该有所行动了
Zeus! We must do something.

994
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,210
你现在不能参加盛宴了
You can not come to the orgy!

995
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,680
你听听我们的劝吧
You have to listen to us.

996
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,620
够了  绑起来
That's it! Shackle!

997
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,120
陛下  您一声令下  我们就行动
Your highness. Whenever you're ready, you just tell me.

998
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,410
-听我信号行动   -嗯嗯
-We go on my signal.  -Mm-hmm.

999
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,410
信号是啥
What is the signal?

1000
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,760
信号就是冲  
It'll be go.

1001
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,220
让我们看看你是什么牛马
Let's see who you are.

1002
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,850
脱下你的伪装吧
Take off your disguise.

1003
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,180
弹指神功
And flick!

1004
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,670
该死的  你弹得太狠了
Flicked too hard, damn it!

1005
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,140
我们要去帮他吗
Should we help him?

1006
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,850
再等会
I mean. Eventually.

1007
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,270
来点葡萄吗
Grape?

1008
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,270
那玩意看起来像个害羞的西葫芦
Looks like a shy courgette.

1009
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,850
你的同伴呢
And what about the others?

1010
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,960
-把他们的伪装也给弹走   -噢不不不  别弹我们
-We take off their disguise too.   -Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

1011
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,830
我们自己来
It's cool.

1012
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,690
-伪装脱掉了   -伪装脱掉了  好了吗
-Disguise gone!   -Disguise off. Cool?

1013
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,400
阿斯加德人
Asgardians...

1014
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,360
我以为奥丁死后你们都灭绝了
I thought you've seen the last of him when Odin died.

1015
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,990
你是索尔
You... are Thor.

1016
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:32,200
雷霆之神
The God of Thunder.

1017
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,780
我看不是雷霆
It is not thunder,

1018
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,650
是小闪电吧
Just the sound of lightning?

1019
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,030
说得好  老爸
Good one, dad!

1020
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,900
宙斯  这些都不重要
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

1021
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,900
他抓走了阿斯加德的孩子们
He's taken Asgardian children.

1022
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,070
那你来找我们是什么意思
Who do you think we are?

1023
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,900
我们又不是神届警察局
The God police?

1024
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,320
神只负责照看自己的子民
Every god watches over their own people.

1025
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,990
不会坐视不理  也不会多管闲事
Nothing more, nothing less.

1026
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,650
阿斯加德的麻烦
Asgardian problems...

1027
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:58,400
阿斯加德自求多福
are Asgardian problems.

1028
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:00,610
伟大的神竟然沦落至此
How the mighty have fallen.

1029
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,200
我的英雄  宙斯
My hero, Zeus...

1030
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,780
怂了
Afraid.

1031
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,610
我讲几句
Couple of things...

1032
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,700
第一  对  我就是怂
One. Yes, I am scared.

1033
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,150
格尔手里有黑死剑
Gorr has the Necrosword.

1034
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,820
也就是说  他可以杀了我们
Which means, he will kill us.

1035
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,700
情况不妙
Not good.

1036
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,530
第二  我知道你想要拯救苍生
Two, I know you're trying to do the right thing.

1037
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:31,570
我懂你
I understand.

1038
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,540
但你现在只会引起恐慌
But all you do, is causing panic.

1039
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,580
恐慌是要不得的
Panic is not good.

1040
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,130
我们在这里很安全
We are safe here.

1041
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,500
而你  我的朋友
You, my friend.

1042
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,080
在这里也很安全
You are safe here.

1043
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,170
所以冷静冷静  小屁孩
So, chill, baby cake.

1044
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,670
喝点小酒  吃点水果
Have some wine. Have some grape.

1045
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,540
在全能之城
Anything goes here...

1046
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,380
你可以随心所欲
In Omnipotent City.

1047
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,250
第三  永远不要跟宙斯顶嘴
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

1048
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,670
我弹得太用力了  我给你把衣服穿上
I flicked too hard. I put your clothes back on.

1049
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,750
现在我允许你穿上衣服
Now, I put your clothes back on.

1050
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:02,210
弹弹弹  毕竟今天是金殿盛会
Flick, flick, flick. It's the Golden Temple of the Gods.

1051
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,250
不是全裸节
It's not a rude and nudy festival.

1052
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,250
就算你不打算帮忙  至少把你的武器借给我们
If you're not gonna help us, then at least, let us use your weapons.

1053
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,080
我们需要你的闪电
We need your lightning bolt.

1054
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:12,710
我的闪电叫雷霆霹雳
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

1055
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,920
所以  你求借人家的秘密武器的时候
So I think, to use somebody's secret weapon like this...

1056
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,170
起码把这个秘密武器的名字喊对了
That you should, at least, get the name right when you ask.

1057
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,080
我可以借用雷霆霹雳吗
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

1058
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,250
雷霆霹雳
Thunderbolt!

1059
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,580
不行
No.

1060
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,750
别担心
Do not worry.

1061
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,920
屠神者
The God Butcher...

1062
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,290
他无法迈向永恒
He will not reach Eternity.

1063
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:02,290
永恒
Eternity?

1064
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,460
迈向永恒是什么意思
What does he mean, "reach Eternity"?

1065
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,330
完蛋了
Oh, shit!

1066
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,460
永恒
Eternity.

1067
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,170
永恒是宇宙中心非常强大的存在
It's a very powerful being at the center of the universe.

1068
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:20,710
他可以授予第一个到达的人一个愿望
He will grant the desire of the first person who reaches it.

1069
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,210
就是个许愿井吗
So it's like a wishing well?

1070
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,420
想想屠神者如果迈向了永恒  会许什么愿
What do you think a guy called, the God Butcher, would wish for?

1071
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,670
如果他到了  那么他就可以在瞬间抹杀所有的神
If he seeks the altar of Eternity, that means he could wipe us out at once.

1072
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,710
-宙斯  我们必须马上行动   -他到不了的
-Zeus, we must act now.   -He's not going to make it.

1073
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,170
他没有钥匙
He doesn't have the key.

1074
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,900
你们就是这样做神的吗
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1075
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,780
像懦夫一样躲在宫殿里
To hide away in a golden palace, like cowards?

1076
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,860
或许神真的堕落了
Maybe we have lost our way.

1077
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,120
你们不愿意帮忙就算了  我们自己去阻止他
You know what? We're gonna stop him ourselves.

1078
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,270
恐怕我也不能让你去
I am afraid, I cannot allow that.

1079
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,220
这是个隐秘的地方
This is a secret place,

1080
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,300
只有众神知道它的所在
known only to the gods.

1081
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,380
而你知道这个地方
You know where we are...

1082
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,840
所以屠神者就可以利用你
The God Butcher could use you...

1083
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,840
来找到我们
To find us.

1084
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,050
情况不妙
This is not good.

1085
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:02,300
所以现在
So now...

1086
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,220
你想走也不行了
You must stay.

1087
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:07,220
守卫
Guards!

1088
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:10,880
嘿
Hey!

1089
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,130
我们现在可以执行我的计划了吗
Can we do my plan now?

1090
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,090
可以  揍他一顿吧
Yes, rush his bum.

1091
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,090
太棒了
Hell, yeah!

1092
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,880
喂  你没说冲啊
Oy, you didn't say "go".

1093
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,260
我来啦
Coming, guys.

1094
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,180
索尔  接着
Thor, catch!

1095
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,800
寇格
Korg!

1096
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:01,550
小瓦  快躲
Val, duck!

1097
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,050
寇格
Korg!

1098
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,300
索尔
Thor.

1099
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,880
不
Oh, no.

1100
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,470
别啊  寇格
No! Korg!

1101
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:16,680
索尔
Thor!

1102
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,130
我要散架了
I'm perishing.

1103
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
宙斯
Zeus!

1104
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,840
下一个死的就是你  奥丁森
You're next, Odinson!

1105
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,690
这才是闪电声
That's the sound of lightning.

1106
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,620
不
No.

1107
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,690
小寇  小寇
Korgi. Korgi!

1108
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,720
索尔
Thor.

1109
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,570
-小寇  -我在这下面
-Korgi?  -I'm down here.

1110
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,920
哪啊  你在哪啊  我会把你弄出来的  放心吧
Where? Where are you? I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

1111
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,270
-寇格  小寇  -我在这儿
-Korg. Korgi!  -Here I am!

1112
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:57,270
我居然没死
I didn't die!

1113
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,500
哦我天  太好了  你还活着
Oh, my God. Yes! You're alive!

1114
01:04:59,500 --> 01:04:59,520
看来石头人的嘴是最能活的
Turns out, the only part of the Kronans that's alive is its mouth.
哦我天  太好了  你还活着
Oh, my God. Yes! You're alive!

1115
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,810
看来石头人的嘴是最能活的
Turns out, the only part of the Kronans that's alive is its mouth.

1116
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,940
听着小寇  我需要你要去召唤山羊船过来
Korgi, listen. I need you to call the goats.

1117
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,110
我会尽力
I'll do my best.

1118
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,300
-你要拼命保护他   -我会的
-Guard him with your life. -I will.

1119
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,320
准备好刺激一把了吗
Ready to go for a ride?

1120
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,210
现在你得掩护我背后
Now, you got me six.

1121
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:17,120
小瓦  8点钟方向
Eight o'clock, Val.

1122
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:18,750
7点48分方向
7:48!

1123
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,440
可恶  我能做到的
I can do this, dammit.

1124
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:22,910
不是这样
That's not it.

1125
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:23,940
也不是这样
That's not it.

1126
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,020
这样也不对
Nope.

1127
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,400
加油啊  寇格  口哨给我吹起来
Come on, Korg. Push those lips.

1128
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,070
我成功啦
I did it!

1129
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:24,190
然后山羊船破窗而入  拯救了我们  我们飞出窗外
And then the goat boat came in, rescued us, and we flew out the window.

1130
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:24,890
这就结束啦
The end.

1131
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,090
又是一场经典索尔冒险
Another classic Thor adventure.

1132
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,930
我不敢相信你竟然杀死宙斯了
Can't believe you killed Zeus.

1133
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,450
粉圈不是总在说嘛
Well, you know what they say...

1134
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,860
不要私联偶像
Never meet your heroes.

1135
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,280
重要的是  我们正在想办法救你们
What's important is, we are on our way to you, right now.

1136
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,020
你们怎样  过得还行吗
How are you guys doing? Are you okay?

1137
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,490
我们还好  就是有点害怕
We're alright. A little scared.

1138
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,010
好吧  我知道恐惧的感觉
Well, listen. I know what it's like to be scared.

1139
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,860
我想告诉你们  我在你们这个年纪时
And I'll tell you, when I was your age...

1140
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,780
未必能有你们勇敢
I don't think I would have been as brave as you.

1141
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,610
真的吗
Really?

1142
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:49,690
其实你们可能是我遇过最勇敢的阿斯加德人
In fact, you might just be the bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1143
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,920
你们都是
All of you.

1144
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,010
我需要你们继续保持勇敢  好吗
So I need you to keep being brave, alright?

1145
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,220
还要互相照顾  你们现在是一个团队了
And take care of each other. You're a team now.

1146
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,840
牢笼孩子队
Team kids in a cage.

1147
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,760
你们能做到吗
Can you do that?

1148
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,350
嗯  我们应该可以做到
Yeah. I think we can do that.

1149
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,030
我对你们有信心
I know you can.

1150
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,930
好吗
Alright?

1151
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,020
-索尔   -怎么啦
-Thor?   -Yeah?

1152
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,060
能见到我的偶像  我很高兴
I'm glad, I met my hero.

1153
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,380
哇  谢谢了  孩子
Wow. Thanks, buddy.

1154
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:19,110
孩子们怎样了
How are the children?

1155
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,350
你应该能明白  毕竟他们还是孩子  有些许害怕也很正常
As you can imagine, they're a little bit scared because they're kids.

1156
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:23,440
但是我告诉他们  一切都会好起来的
But I told him that everything is going to plan.

1157
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,320
你骗他们了
And so you lied to them.

1158
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,410
我们还有计划吗
We still have a plan?

1159
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,560
-当然有了   -不  已经没计划了
-Yes, there's a plan.   -There's no plan.

1160
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,870
-有计划   -没计划
-There is a plan.   -No, there's no plan.

1161
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:31,170
我们连召集天神战队都失败了
We failed to raise a god army.

1162
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,540
-寇格还死了   -他没死啊
-Korg is dead.   -He's not dead.

1163
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,300
-我没死   -反正只剩了个头
-I'm not dead.   -Well, he's a head.

1164
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,640
而你  你被羞辱得体无完肤
And you, you were properly humilated.

1165
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:39,080
不  是被脱光光了只剩肌肤罢了  可是我无所谓啊
No, I got properly naked, which I'm okay with.

1166
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,920
-简呢   -我也无所谓
-Jane?   -I was okay with it.

1167
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:42,120
-寇格呢   -我爱惨了
-Korg?   -I loved it.

1168
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:46,120
重点是我们比之前更脆弱了  现在进入暗影维度
The point is,we're going into the Shadow Realm weaker than we were before.

1169
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,610
-这就是送死   -不  没有人会死  
-We're gonna die.   -No one's gonna die,

1170
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,690
-好吗   -真的吗
-Okay?   -Really?

1171
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,120
没事啦  我们刚才表现不错啊
Everything is fine. We did great back there.

1172
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,030
-我们杀了宙斯  -是你杀的
-We killed Zeus.   -You killed Zeus.

1173
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:56,090
你或许觉得  这件事对整个宇宙来说可能是灾难性的  也可能不是
For you, that may or may not be catastrophic for the whole universe.

1174
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:56,890
当然了
And surely,

1175
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:59,760
我们可能一辈子都要受整个神界追捕
The entire god kingdom is probably gonna hunt us down for the rest of our days.

1176
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,580
但是  你偷了这件夺目的武器
But listen, you stole this beautiful weapon.

1177
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,470
你看  这就是我们的战队了
Alright, this is the army right here.

1178
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,800
它又光亮又纤细又强大又漂亮
It's sleek, it's slender, it's powerful, it's beautiful.

1179
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,690
不过是属于你的  我爱死它了
Well, for you, I love it.

1180
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,810
只属于你  女武神
For you, Valkyrie.

1181
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,250
反正这也不是我的菜
I mean, it's not really what I'm into.

1182
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,410
我  我的武器还搁外面呢
But I got my, my weapon out there.

1183
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:17,300
可否借你的酒杯一用
Can I borrow that for a sec?

1184
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,820
啊  在这儿呢  我的老朋友
Ah! There you are, old friend.

1185
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,150
刚才出场可真惊艳啊
That was quite an entrance, back there.

1186
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,100
听着  嗯
Listen, uh...

1187
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:33,900
我们和好了吧
We good?

1188
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:34,970
你怎么说
Yeah?

1189
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,530
我不会因为有前任武器在场感到尴尬的  对吧兄弟
I mean, I don't feel weird having my ex weapon around, but come on.

1190
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,560
妙尔尼尔  那都是过去式了
Mjölnir, in the past.

1191
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:42,220
现在只剩我们俩了  兄弟
It's you and me now, buddy.

1192
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,040
这样吧
You know what?

1193
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:45,290
我觉得是时候让你喝第一杯啤酒了
I think it's time for your first beer.

1194
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,230
你说呢
What do you say?

1195
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:52,610
好喝是吧
Delicious.

1196
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,820
我们最近都在吵架  对不起
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1197
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:04,380
嘿
Hey.

1198
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,230
噢  嘿
Oh, hey.

1199
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,300
景致很壮观是吧
It's quite the... view, huh?

1200
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,400
是啊  很漂亮
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1201
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,680
如我所说  你刚才太威武了
As I was saying, I was very, very impressed with what you did back there.

1202
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,080
你和妙尔尼尔都是
You and Mjölnir.

1203
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,030
嗯嗯
Yeah.

1204
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,320
太空海豚
Space Dolphins.

1205
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,380
-什么   -你应该看看太空海豚
-What?   -You should see some space dolphins.

1206
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,080
-哇哦   -是吧
-Wow.   -Yeah.

1207
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:33,830
太美了
Beautiful.

1208
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,110
-天哪   -它们特别漂亮  特别罕见
-God.   -They're so beautiful, so rare,

1209
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,650
它们是非常忠诚的生物
They're very loyal creatures.

1210
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,270
交配后便会一起度过一辈子
They mate for life...

1211
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,800
不过他们是六人行
In packs of 6.

1212
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,200
只有爱
Just... love.

1213
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:48,840
天哪兄弟你真辣
♪ Oh, brother. Man, you look so hot ♪

1214
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:52,490
惹得我想把你压
♪ I wanna get in your rocks ♪

1215
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:55,810
我们终于相逢时  这晚会暖到爆炸
♪ When we get together, we're gonna get it on ♪

1216
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:59,350
咱再一起造点娃
♪ I'm gonna make some babies ♪

1217
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,060
这首歌是我爸向我另一个爸求偶时唱的
That is the song that my dad sang to my other dad when they were courting.

1218
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:07,200
当两个石头人人想造人的时候  他们就会跑进山里
When two Kronans want to make a baby, they get together inside a mountain.

1219
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,110
一起泡入小熔岩池
They go down to a little lava pool.

1220
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,730
他们在热熔岩里牵手
They hold hands over the hot lava.

1221
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,290
一个月后
And then after a month,

1222
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,320
才放开手
They pull their hands apart...

1223
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:16,280
一个美丽小石头人宝宝就出生了
and they finally created a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1224
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,410
噢  迷人又性感
Oh, it's fascinating. And hot.

1225
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,180
有没有什么人对你来说是独一无二的呢
Did you ever had a special someone?

1226
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,770
有...
Oh, I've had...

1227
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,200
太多独一无二的了
so many special someones.

1228
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,580
但是吧  我也不知道
But, I don't know.

1229
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,740
我不确定还想不想再体验一次
I don't know if I want it again.

1230
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:30,650
是因为你女朋友战死了  而你一直不能原谅自己吗
Is that because you lost your girlfriend in battle and never forgave yourself?

1231
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,430
然后你就喝得酩酊大醉  想在酒里找到答案
And now, you're just trying to find the answers in the bottom of the bottle.

1232
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,540
还有那些毫无意义的放纵  只是为了麻痹你的痛苦
And some meaningless downfall, which only serves to numb the pain.

1233
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,160
而不是给你带来真的幸福或满足
Instead of bringing you real happiness or satisfaction.

1234
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,600
对  差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

1235
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,960
它们好美
Beautiful.

1236
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,400
美丽的存在
Beautiful thing.

1237
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,350
简
Jane.

1238
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,400
-索尔   -我想要因为你而感到蛋疼
-Thor.   -I want to feel shitty about you.

1239
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:56,460
啥
What?

1240
01:10:58,430 --> 01:10:59,240
对我来说  我想...
For me, I want...

1241
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:00,310
我...
I...

1242
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,750
我想有那种痛心的感觉
I want to feel shitty about something.

1243
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,440
我想这个让我心痛的人应该是你
I think that's you.

1244
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,690
这解释还是不够好
Not really getting any better.

1245
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,090
不太对是吧  该死
It's not, is it? Damn it.

1246
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,140
我朋友告诉我  宁可为失去爱而有那种蛋疼的感觉
My friend here told me that it was better to feel shitty

1247
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,580
也好过从来没有感受过爱
for losing love than it is to never experience love,

1248
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,420
甚至麻木不仁  活成一个空壳  我觉得他说得有道理
and to feel nothing at all, and feel empty and I think he was right.

1249
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,700
很久以来  我就是一具空壳
Which is how I've been feeling for a long time.

1250
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,060
我推开身边的人  和他们保持距离
I push people away, kept them at a distance

1251
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,430
只是因为害怕失去
because of the fear of that loss.

1252
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,270
但我不想再这样下去了  我不想再这样活着
But I don't want to do that anymore. I don't wanna live like that.

1253
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,760
关上心门总比感到心痛强
Better to close off your heart than feel the pain.

1254
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:28,770
我就是这么做的
That's what I did.
关上心门总比感到心痛强
Better to close off your heart than feel the pain.

1255
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,490
我就是这么做的
That's what I did.

1256
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,280
对  我关起我的心门然后做冥想
Yes, I closed off my heart and I meditated.

1257
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,410
-你也冥想吗   -我不  那好无聊
-You meditate?   -No, it's so boring.

1258
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,450
其实这只会让我更愤怒
It actually made me more angry.

1259
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,430
但我不愿再为了所谓的命运自暴自弃
But I'm tired of giving myself up as the idea of fate

1260
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:42,000
不愿再纠结于抱怨这个世界还要让我失去多少
and try to figure out what the universe wants from me.

1261
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,980
我想要活在当下
I want to live in the moment.

1262
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,650
我想把每天都当成最后一天过
I wanted to live like there's no tomorrow.

1263
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:45,700
把一切顾虑抛在脑后
Throw caution to the wind.

1264
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,290
我想要  我想要和你在一起  简
I want... I want to be with you, Jane.

1265
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:50,800
你觉得呢
What do you say?

1266
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,510
我得了癌症
I have cancer.

1267
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,520
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

1268
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:57,660
我时日无多了
I'm sick.

1269
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,290
-等一下  到底怎么了  -再见
-Wait, what is happening?   -Bye.

1270
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:00,890
不不不不
No, no, no, no.

1271
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,640
简  简  简
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

1272
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,130
-怎么回事  简  -我说什么了
-Wait, Jane.   -What did I say?

1273
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:04,150
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean that.

1274
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,220
开玩笑的
Just kidding.

1275
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,570
我
I...

1276
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,250
才没得癌症呢
don't have cancer.

1277
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,180
咱们去大打一场吧
Let's go smash something.

1278
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,880
简  我很抱歉
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1279
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,450
不用觉得抱歉
Don't be sorry.

1280
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:17,460
什么时候查出来的
When did you find out?

1281
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,420
嗯
Um...

1282
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:20,820
半年前
About six months ago. I...

1283
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,100
当时我只是觉得很疲惫
I was just feeling tired.

1284
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,170
然后他们就告诉我已经发展到晚期了
And then, they told me I have stage four.

1285
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,690
准备后事吧
Get my affairs in order.

1286
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,000
然后我听到了妙尔尼尔在召唤我  所以
And then, I heard Mjölnir calling me and so...

1287
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,790
我就想  也许
I thought, maybe...

1288
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,960
如果科学没有用的话  也许
If science didn't help, then maybe...

1289
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,740
维京人的宇宙魔法有用呢
Viking space magic.

1290
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:38,890
这就是你来新阿斯加德的原因
And that's why you came to New Asgard.

1291
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:41,980
对  我觉得雷神锤可能能救我...
Yeah, I thought the hammer maybe could cure me...

1292
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,940
我觉得我有好转了
and I think it's getting better.

1293
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:46,770
也可能没有
Maybe not.

1294
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,540
简  你我都不知道我们还剩下多少时间
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1295
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,140
你不知道明天会发生什么
You don't know what tomorrow holds.

1296
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,740
而妙尔尼尔  它选择了你
And Mjölnir, Mjölnir chose you.

1297
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:58,580
它选择你是因为你有资格
It chose you because you are worthy.

1298
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,160
这意义非凡
And that's something.

1299
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,670
当我第一次见到你的时候  我还没有资格...
When I first met you, I was unworthy...

1300
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:04,690
我无法举起我的锤子
I was unable to pick up my hammer.

1301
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:09,550
那时你告诉我  没有比帮助弱小更伟大的使命了
You told me, there was no greater purpose than to help those in need.

1302
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,510
是你让我变成配得上它的人
You made me worthy.

1303
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,410
所以无论你想做什么  我们都可以一起
So whatever you wanna do, we can do together.

1304
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,040
好的
Okay.

1305
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:19,050
那  你想干什么
Now what do you wanna do?
好的
Okay.

1306
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:22,260
那  你想干什么
Now what do you wanna do?

1307
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,950
我想让那些孩子们回到家人身边
I'm gonna get those children back to their families.

1308
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,350
我想完成这个任务
I want to finish that mission.

1309
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,800
你听着像一位真正的雷神
Spoken like a true Thor.

1310
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,050
现在感觉如何
How do you feel now?

1311
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:34,380
很恐惧
So scared.

1312
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:36,790
你呢
How do you feel?

1313
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,010
难过
Shitty.

1314
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,380
有多难过
How shitty?

1315
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,390
-特别难过  -那好吧...
-Really shitty.  -Well then...

1316
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,540
我很好奇这俩人在外面聊啥呢
I wonder what those two are talking about, out there.

1317
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,890
他们才没在聊天呢
Yeah, they're not talking.

1318
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,380
原来如此
Oh!

1319
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,520
你觉得他们俩会不会在热熔岩池上手拉手
Do you think those two will ever hold hands over a hot lava pool

1320
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,180
然后造个索尔宝宝出来
to make a Thor baby?

1321
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,050
不大可能  非常遗憾
Unlikely, sadly.

1322
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,860
哦  太可惜了
Oh, that's too bad.

1323
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,690
我觉得索尔肯定会是个好爸爸
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1324
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:14,890
嘿  咱们到了
Hey! We're here.

1325
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,710
所有的色彩都去哪了
Where did all the color go?

1326
01:14:58,920 --> 01:14:59,960
他们不在这儿
They're not here.

1327
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,770
那他们在哪儿
Where are they?

1328
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:27,550
这是什么破地方
What the hell is this place?

1329
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:58,550
钥匙是彩虹桥
Bifrost is the key.

1330
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:08,850
中计了
It's a trap!

1331
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,680
你能告诉我刚才你为啥把暴风战斧扔出窗外了吗
Can you tell me why you just threw Stormbreaker out the window?

1332
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,910
他要用它去打开迈向永恒的门
He needs it to open the gates of Eternity.

1333
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,820
我们不要再这样见面了
We really have to stop meeting like this.

1334
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,030
把斧头叫来
Call the ax.

1335
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,780
你什么时候去看牙医我就什么时候给你看看斧头
I'll call the ax when you call the dentist.

1336
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,440
召唤战斧
Call the ax.

1337
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,920
告诉我那些孩子在哪儿不然我就杀了你
Tell me where the children are or I'm gonna kill you.

1338
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,110
召唤战斧
Call the ax.

1339
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,850
你这神还不错
Some god you are.

1340
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:32,460
你对神
You know nothing

1341
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:33,750
一无所知
of being a god.

1342
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:38,160
你寻求诸神的协助
You went to the gods for help

1343
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,670
而他们毫无作为
and they did nothing.

1344
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,970
在这一点上  我们是相似的
We're alike, in that sense.

1345
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,630
他和你完全不同
He's nothing like you.

1346
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,130
你说什么
What was that?

1347
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,030
我说  你和他没有一丝共同点
I said, he's nothing like you.

1348
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:55,410
没错  我可不是个伪君子
That's right. I'm not a hypocrite.

1349
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:58,090
我真的在创造和平
I'm truly creating peace.

1350
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,020
什么和平  你正在谋杀无辜的神祗
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

1351
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,250
无辜
Innocent?

1352
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,470
你是个女武神吗
Are you a Valkyrie?

1353
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:04,750
对 
Yes.

1354
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,150
哈哈  这太有趣了
Haha, how exciting.

1355
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,530
噢  诸神也辜负了你...
Oh, the gods failed you, too...

1356
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:15,090
当你的姐妹们遭到屠杀
When your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1357
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,640
不许你提起...
Don't you dare speak...

1358
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,390
当你心爱的女人战死在沙场上
Did you pray to the gods...

1359
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:23,900
你是否会向众神祈祷
When the women you loved laid dying on the battlefield?

1360
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,350
当你的家人被残杀
Did you beg them for help...

1361
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,490
你是否祈求过他们的帮助
As your family was massacred?

1362
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,830
和你聊天很开心
Good chat.

1363
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:39,730
至于这边这位
This one...

1364
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,460
你很有趣
You're interesting.

1365
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:43,920
你和他们不同
You're different.

1366
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:46,500
没错
Yes.

1367
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,030
你就快死了啊
You're dying.

1368
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,670
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

1369
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:01,740
我们俩是一样的
We're on the same path.

1370
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:07,280
就像黑死剑赋予了我力量一样
Just as the sword empowered me.

1371
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:10,940
雷神之锤赋予了你力量
The hammer empowered you.

1372
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,940
但它却没有改变你的命运
But it did nothing to change your fate.

1373
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:17,900
众神只会利用你
The gods will use you...

1374
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,450
但不会帮助你
But they will not help you.

1375
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,550
这个世界上没有
There is no...

1376
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,280
永恒的奖赏
eternal reward...

1377
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:27,700
给我们
for us.

1378
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,690
她很快就会逝去
She'll be gone soon.

1379
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,180
而你知道是谁会对她视而不见吗
And you know who won't help her?

1380
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,910
我让你猜一猜
I give you one guess.

1381
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,470
我了解你的痛苦
I know your pain.

1382
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,550
爱就是痛苦
Love is pain.

1383
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:02,120
我也曾有个女儿
I had a daughter once.

1384
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:07,540
我将希望寄托在众神上  希望他们会救我的女儿
I put my faith in a higher power, hoping it will save her.

1385
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,770
而她
And she...

1386
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,120
还是死了
died.

1387
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,790
现在我明白了
Now I understand...

1388
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:21,360
我女儿很幸运
My daughter is the lucky one.

1389
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,430
她不需要在一个由邪恶神祗掌控
She does not have to grow up in a world...

1390
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:29,080
一个充满折磨
Of suffering and pain

1391
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:34,140
充满痛苦的世界中长大
run by wicked gods.

1392
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:38,350
选择你的爱人
Choose love.

1393
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:42,550
召唤战斧
Call the ax.

1394
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:55,090
召唤战斧
Call the ax.

1395
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:33,800
-你还好吧   -当然
-You okay?   -Yeah.

1396
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,650
嗯  我有点想杀了这家伙
Hmm, I want to kill this guy.

1397
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,330
我也是  但是我们要活捉他
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

1398
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,260
他是我们找到那些孩子的唯一线索
He's our only link to finding those children.

1399
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:58,170
噢  谢谢你  山羊先生
Oh! Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1400
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,900
小瓦
Val!

1401
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,480
我们得把她送出去
We gotta get her out of here.

1402
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,630
没事的  我在
I got you.

1403
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,370
嘿我们来了  来吧  我们走
Hey, guys, we're here. Come on, let's go.

1404
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,540
暴风战斧  带我们回家
Stormbreaker, take us home.

1405
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:08,140
...这个速度是我们前所未见的
...at a rate that none of us have seen before.

1406
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,590
听着  我们还有很多激进的治疗方式可以尝试
Look, there are other, more aggressive forms of treatment we can try,

1407
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:15,640
但是有某种东西正在干扰她身体抵抗癌症的能力
but something's affecting her body's ability to fight the cancer.

1408
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,940
我很抱歉  索尔
I'm sorry, Thor.

1409
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,380
噢  你在这呢
Oh, there you are.

1410
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,410
发生什么事了
What's going on out there?

1411
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,600
啊  就是有个傻子造了个没有门的冰箱  你敢信吗
Oh, some moron made a fridge without a door. Can you believe it?

1412
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:40,990
别担心  我拿了它里面所有的好东西
Don't you worry, I got it open and got you all sorts of goodies.

1413
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:41,880
小瓦怎么样了
How's Val?

1414
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:44,500
噢  她应该会很痛  但她还情况稳定
Oh, she's in a lot of pain, uh, but she is stable.

1415
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,840
那就好
Okay, good.

1416
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:47,760
现在  你得把这个从我身上...
Now you just gotta get this...

1417
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,320
-拔掉   -哇哦  不不不等一下
-out of my...   -Woah! No, no, no.

1418
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:50,120
让它们插着吧
That's gotta stay in there.

1419
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,890
让这些灵丹妙药起作用  所以...
That's all the magic potions and elixirs doing their thing, so...

1420
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:55,170
我需要出去一下
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment.

1421
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:56,900
接孩子  呃  可能再顺带杀个坏人
Pick up the kids. Uh, kill a bad guy.

1422
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,620
然后我会马上赶回来
And then, I'll come straight back.

1423
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,820
你不带我一起去么
You're going without me?

1424
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,520
呃  对
Uh, yeah.

1425
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,560
说好的  什么都一起做呢
What happened to like... doing everything together?

1426
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,110
他会用那些孩子来让你分心
He's gonna use those kids to distract you.

1427
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:07,880
你需要我
You need me.

1428
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,140
我确实需要你  简
I do need you, Jane.

1429
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,370
我需要你活着
I need you alive.

1430
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,220
有你一起战斗真的很棒
Would be great to have you on the battlefield.

1431
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,680
肩并肩对抗格尔
Fighting Gorr side by side,

1432
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,620
但是那把锤子正侵蚀你的生命
but that hammer is killing you.

1433
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:19,990
每当你使用它  它就会从你身体里汲取足以致命的体力
Every time you use it, it's draining all of your mortal strength,

1434
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,310
让你的身体无法抵抗癌症
leaving your body unable to fight the cancer.

1435
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,340
说好的把每天都当最后一天活呢
What happened to live like there's no tomorrow?

1436
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,340
我说这话的时候还不知道你的最后一天可能真的快到了
It was before I knew you might not have one.

1437
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,690
为什么不再来一次冒险呢
Why not have one more adventure?

1438
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:30,830
简  如果有哪怕一丝生还的机会  你也不能放过
Jane, if there's a chance to live. You have to take it.

1439
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:33,920
你说话的口吻像一个没得癌症的真雷神
Spoken like a true Thor who does not have cancer.

1440
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:41,530
我知道  我听起来一定像个来自新墨西哥州的帅气天体物理学家
I know, I seem like some cool astrophysicist from New Mexico.

1441
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,480
生活在梦中
Just living the dream.

1442
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,480
但是  看着我
But, look at me.

1443
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,180
我想要继续战斗
I wanna keep fighting.

1444
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:47,980
我成为了神威雷神
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1445
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,250
而你希望我放弃这一切
And you want me not to do that?

1446
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,760
如果放弃了这一切  有再多的时间又有什么意义
What's the point of more time than this?

1447
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,520
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

1448
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:58,890
我一直都爱着你
I've always loved you.

1449
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,770
而这对我们来说是一次宝贵的机会
And this is a chance, for us.

1450
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:06,020
如果你再举起那把该死的锤子  那我们将失去机会
If you pick up that damn hammer again, then that chance is gone.

1451
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:19,510
由你来选择  简
It's your choice, Jane.

1452
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,670
但如果我没有让你留下来  我们一起想办法解决问题
But I'd regret it, every single day.

1453
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:26,010
那我余生的每一天都将在后悔中度过
If I didn't ask you to stay here, so we can try and figure this out together.

1454
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:31,660
你最好能及时回到我身边
You better come back to me.

1455
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,140
我会尽我所能  尽快回来
I'm coming back, as soon as I can.

1456
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,190
祝你好运
Break a leg.

1457
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,750
他才会是需要好运的那个
I'll break all his legs.

1458
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,890
记住  通往永恒的大门就在字面意义上的
Remember that, the gate to Eternity is at the literal center...

1459
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:56,840
-宇宙中心  如果你穿过了彗星群...    -我记住了  宇宙
-of the universe. If you go past the cluster of comets...   -Universe.

1460
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,140
知道了  师父别念了  跳过这个话题
Yes, yes. I know. We've been over this.

1461
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,280
我不会迷路的
I'm not going to get lost.

1462
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:02,420
你的伤怎么样
So how are you feeling with the old stab wound?

1463
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:05,160
-感觉把我肾捅没了了   -真的假的
-I think I lost my kidney   -Gone? Completely?

1464
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,080
我也想和你一起去  不过...
I wish I could join you, but...

1465
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,260
我可能有命去没命回  救不回来孩子们
I'd probably die and that won't help get the kids back.

1466
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:11,150
所以你只能自己去
So you'll have to go it alone.

1467
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:13,900
只要毁掉那把剑就好
All you have to do, is destroy that sword.

1468
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:15,360
他的力量都源自那把剑
It's his source of power.

1469
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,880
没了剑他活不了的
He won't survive long without it.

1470
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,920
嘿  活着回来
Hey, don't die.

1471
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,080
我一定
Hell, no.

1472
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,560
永恒
Eternity.

1473
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,320
终于啊
Finally.

1474
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,630
来吧
Come on.

1475
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:04,760
嗨  孩子们
Hey, kids.

1476
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:08,480
我就知道他会来的
I knew he'd come.

1477
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:11,490
快走  孩子们  快跑
Go. Go, kids.

1478
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,520
大伙还好吗
Everyone okay?

1479
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,490
都站在一起  别分散开
Alright, gather round. Gather round.

1480
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,750
线下见面的感觉真不错
Good to see you, in person.

1481
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:38,550
好了  大家听我说
Alright, listen up! Here's the plan.

1482
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,010
我们偷偷走到暴风战斧那里
We sneak our way towards Stormbreaker,

1483
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:44,880
小心一点  别撞上那些巨型暗影怪物
Being very careful not to bump into, any of those big shadow monsters.

1484
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:48,010
他们不会就在我后面吧
They're behind me, aren't they?

1485
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:54,890
你们有人打过仗吗
Does anyone here have battle experience?

1486
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:56,180
战斗经验
Battle experience?

1487
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,330
正好  现在就是最好的学习机会
Well, no time to learn like the present.

1488
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:59,850
但我们没有你那么强啊
But, we're not strong like you.

1489
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:00,670
我们只是小孩而已
We're just kids.

1490
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:03,090
别忘了  你们可是阿斯加德的小孩
Hey, don't forget. You're Asgardian kids.

1491
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,080
我不是  我只是个狼人小孩
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

1492
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,730
我是米达斯的小孩
And I'm a Midassian kid.

1493
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:08,010
-我是法利加人   -好吧好吧
-I'm Falligarian.   -Okay, okay.

1494
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:10,440
那你们做一天阿斯加德人好吗
But today, you're Asgardians.

1495
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,070
拿起你们的武器
Now, collect your weapons.

1496
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,110
拿什么
What?

1497
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:15,210
找到什么拿什么
Go and find anything you can pick up.

1498
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,560
然后都带到这里来
And bring it back here.

1499
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:17,940
快  快
Hurry, hurry.

1500
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:19,550
好的  真棒  快点
Okay, cool. Come on!

1501

1504
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:28,800
今天 是被载入史册的一天

1505
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:33,350
今天  是被后人传颂的一天
Today's a day they'll talk about for generations to come.

1506
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:36,390
今天  我们都是太空维京人
Today, we are Space Vikings!

1507
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:38,750
举起武器
Present... arms!

1508
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,360
任何一个举起武器
Whosoever hold these weapons

1509
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,890
真心坚信他们可以回家的人
and believes in going home if they be true of heart.

1510
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:50,740
都有资格
is .therefore worthy and shall possess...

1511
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,960
短暂地获得
For a limited time only.

1512
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:57,750
雷神之力
The power of Thor!

1513
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:08,300
艾克索将军
General Axl...

1514
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,490
将你的军队带到战斧那边
Lead your army to that ax.

1515
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,460
为阿斯加德
We shall do our work...

1516
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,810
我们将拼尽全力

1537
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:17,750
不
No.

1538
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:32,870
简
Jane.

1539
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:52,220
毁了那把剑他就死定了
Destroy that sword and he's dead.

1540
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:54,630
大门就要开了  你得阻止暴风战斧
The gate is almost open. You gotta stop Stormbreaker.

1541
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,340
没事的  我解决他
It's okay. I got him.

1542
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,910
暴风战斧  停下来
Stormbreaker, stop this!

1543
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,350
控制一下你自己  看看你在干什么呢
Get a hold of yourself. Look what you're doing.

1544
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,630
我得把你带走
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1545
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,120
快点  快点  伙计
Come on. Come on, buddy.

1546
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:21,630
快放开  我的朋友
Let go of my friend.

1547
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,690
你输了  雷神小姐
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1548
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,130
第一
First off,

1549
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:38,630
我叫神威雷神
the name is Mighty Thor.

1550
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:41,970
第二
Secondly...

1551
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,870
如果这个名字你叫不来
If you can't say Mighty Thor,

1552
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:48,960
叫我简·福斯特博士也可以接受
I'll accept Dr. Jane Foster!

1553
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,220
第三
Thirdly,

1554
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:57,270
吃我一锤
eat my hammer!

1555
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:07,940
暴风战斧
Stormbreaker!

1556
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,850
我就知道你可以的
I knew you could do it.

1557
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:16,980
艾克索  带他们回家
Axl! Get them home.

1558
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:06,490
简
Jane?

1559
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:07,950
我没事
I'm okay.

1560
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,340
你得阻止他
You gotta stop him.

1561
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:41,430
格尔  停下
Gorr, stop!

1562
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:50,300
如果停下来  我还算什么父亲
What kind of father would I be, if I stopped.

1563
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,080
我理解你的痛苦  但这不是解决方法
I know your pain, but this isn't the way.

1564
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:02,620
你寻求的并不是死亡或者复仇
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

1565
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,360
那你说我在寻求什么
What do I seek?

1566
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:22,400
你在寻找爱
You seek love.

1567
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:26,590
爱吗
Love?

1568
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:30,650
我为什么要寻求爱
Why should I seek love?

1569
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,900
因为那是我们所有人的渴望
Because that's all any of us want.

1570
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,560
你怎么敢弃我而去
How dare, you turn your back on me.

1571
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,470
你赢了  格尔
You won, Gorr.

1572
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,900
这是我能和她共度的最后时光  为什么要浪费在你身上
Why would I spend my last moments with you, when I can be with her?

1573
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:49,910
我选择爱
I choose love.

1574
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:52,280
你也可以选择爱  你可以复活她
You can, too. You can bring her back.

1575
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,400
许你的愿望吧
Make your wish.

1576
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:31,050
我要死了
I'm dying.

1577
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:34,120
她无依无靠
She would have no one.

1578
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,120
她会孤单的
She would be alone.

1579
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,200
她不会的
She won't be alone.

1580
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
爸爸的宝贝
My love.

1581
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,570
我好想你
I've missed you, so much.

1582
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:14,950
我也很想你
I've missed you, too.

1583
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:20,700
-我很抱歉   -没事的
-I'm so sorry.   -It's okay.

1584
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:25,350
我拿起锤子的那一刻
As soon as I picked up that hammer...

1585
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,900
就好像我已经重获新生
It's like... I've gotten an extra life.

1586
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:33,750
就好像
It's just...

1587
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:37,180
魔法一样
Magical.

1588
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,340
对一个凡人来讲还不错
Not too bad for a human.

1589
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,090
对一个神明来讲也还好
Not too bad for a god.

1590
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:50,330
我想好我的口号了
I think I figured out my catchphrase.

1591
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:52,890
-真的吗  是什么   -你凑近点
-Really? What is it?   -Come closer.

1592
01:42:58,010 --> 01:42:58,990
真不错
Perfect.

1593
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:01,980
-史上最佳   -多谢夸奖
-It's the best one yet.   -Thank you.

1594
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:12,040
不要再关闭心门
Keep your heart open.

1595
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,170
我爱你
I love you.

1596
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,170
我也爱你
I love you too.

1597
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:09,780
保护好她
Protect her.

1598
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:12,000
保护好我的宝贝
Protect my love.

1599
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:49,220
让我来给你们讲讲太空里的维京人传奇
Let me tell you the legend of the Space Viking.

1600
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,850
她又名
a.k.a

1601
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,640
"神威雷神"
"The Mighty Thor".

1602
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:54,020
又名
a.k.a

1603
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:56,290
"简·福斯特博士"
"Dr. Jane Foster".

1604
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:04,070
她牺牲自己拯救了宇宙  告诉我们有资格举起雷神之锤意味着什么
Her sacrifice saved the universe and taught us all what it means to be worthy.

1605
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:07,170
她帮助了众神之子
She helped the children of the gods.

1606
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:09,430
他们被一道激光传送回家
Who laser beamed their way back home,

1607
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:13,870
他们的家从昏沉的小渔村变成了旅游景点
to their dozy, little fishing village turned tourist destination.

1608
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:15,550
艾克索
Axl!

1609
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,180
我好想你
I missed you.

1610
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:18,970
-你没事吗   -我很好  没事的
-Are you okay?   -I'm fine. I'm okay.

1611
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:20,290
-你确定吗   -嗯嗯我没事
-Are you sure?   -I'm okay.

1612
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,950
-孩子们又过上了安全的生活   -大点声  三
-The kids were safe to be kids again.   -Louder, three!

1613
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:25,790
腿再岔开些
Widen your stance.

1614
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:29,740
尤其是他们的国王要求他们参加防身术练习
Especially after their king, made them all go to self-defense classes.

1615
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:32,820
-看看这些太空里的小维京人们   -然后是最重要的一步
-Look at all those budding Space Vikings.   -And the most important part,

1616
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:34,960
喊杀声
The war cry!

1617
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:37,730
就连海姆达尔的儿子
Even Heimdall's son,

1618
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:39,080
艾克索·海姆达尔森
Axl Heimdallson,

1619
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:41,720
像他爸一样用眼睛放魔法
who could now do his dad's freaky eye magic,

1620
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,660
现在也成为了一名战士
was becoming quite the warrior.

1621
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:46,320
阿斯加德的未来稳如磐石
The future of Asgard was secure.

1622
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:49,240
谈到未来
Speaking of futures,

1623
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,920
我也在打造自己的后代
I was forging one of my own.

1624
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:53,070
我的身体已经长回来了
Now that my body has grown back.

1625
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:55,620
我跟一个叫韦恩的家伙造小人
With a dude I met called Dwayne.

1626
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,030
你们问索尔吗
What about Thor, you ask?

1627
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:01,330
他踏上了一段新的旅程
He embarked on a new journey.

1628
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,140
因为他找到了活下去的理由
Because he had found something to live for.

1629
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,900
倾注爱的理由
Something to love for.

1630
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:09,520
一个小家伙把他从忧郁神
