1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,036


2
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:29,779
為什麼他們餵他比我們好？
How come they feed him better than us?

3
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,894
哦，看誰又送我的餐遲到了
Oh, look who's late with my meal again.

4
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,577
呃，伊瓦爾 Uh, Ivar.

5
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,946
你願意做個紳士，並給我拿些橄欖來，拜託？
Would you be a gentlemen and get me more olives, please?

6
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:06,350
畢竟，今天是我的生日
It's my birthday, after all.

7
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:13,923
伸出你的手
Give out your hand.

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,193
好吧，我咬一口
All right, I'll bite.

9
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,264


10
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,767
我要再喝點酒
I'm going for more wine.

11
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,650


12
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,921
再見，伊瓦爾
So long, Ivar.

13
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,656


14
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,326
是的 Yes.

15
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,994
伊瓦爾？ 伊瓦爾！
Ivar? Ivar!

16
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,098


17
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,970
你永遠逃不掉
You will never escape.

18
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,542
奧丁和索爾會找到你的
Odin and Thor will find you.

19
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,644
我已經逃跑了
I've already escaped.

20
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,778


21
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:50,853


22
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:02,832


23
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:08,505


24
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,974
洛基逃跑了！ 搜索每個房間！
Loki has escaped! Search every room!

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,009
搜查城堡！
Search the castle!

26
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:21,784
洛基! Loki!

27
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,890
現在就停止這種瘋狂
Stop this madness right now.

28
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,327
塵世會倒下
Midgard will fall.

29
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:34,331
而我會重新種植這棵樹
And I will replant this tree.

30
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:37,501
當這種情況發生時，你或者可以加入我
When that happens, you can either join me

31
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:38,968
或者你可以反對我
or you can be against me.

32
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,638
但我向你保證，一切都太晚了
But I assure you, it will be too late,

33
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,038
因為我將擁有所有的力量
for I will have all the power.

34
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:47,278
衹有傻瓜才會尋找非常虛弱的世界
Only a fool would seek a shattered world.

35
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:51,848
沒有什麼可以讓你統治了！
There would be nothing left for you to rule!

36
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,884
我不會允許你
I will not allow you

37
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,955
來完成拉格納羅克的命運
to fulfill the destiny of Ragnarok.

38
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:01,024
這不是我希望的答案
It was not the answer I'd hoped for,

39
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:04,295
但是如果你擋了路，那就這樣吧!
but if you get in the way, so be it.

40
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,604
你的魔法起不了作用...
Your magic does not work...

41
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,473
在我的王座房間裡
in my throne room.

42
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,244
我不需要魔法來打敗你衰老的靈魂
I don't need magic to defeat your old, decrepit soul.

43
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:26,550
沒有你的權杖，你什麼都不是！
Without your staff, you are nothing!

44
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,586
洛基，現在住手
Loki, stop this now.

45
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,556
什麼，你害怕一旦我釋放了大灰狼
What, are you afraid that once I release the Great Wolf,

46
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,092
它會追捕你，並完成它的使命
that he will hunt you down and fulfill his destiny

47
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:39,363
藉著毀滅你？仍然可以有和平
by destroying you? There can still be peace.

48
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,332


49
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:01,951
我不喜歡你的判決
I took no pleasure in your sentencing.

50
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,958
然而我在那裡，在那地牢裡腐爛
Yet there I was, rotting away in that dungeon.

51
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:15,065
我被人民...
I spent far too long idly by...

52
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:16,933
我們的人民嘲笑和嘲笑太久了
mocked and ridiculed by the people, our people,

53
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,302
當你坐在王座的房間裡
while you've sat there in that throne room,

54
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,437
對我們的世界無所事事
doing nothing for our world.

55
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,441
我可以完成那些年前開始的事情！
I can finish what I started all those years ago!

56
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:28,445


57
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,617
投降，洛基 投降!
Surrender, Loki. Surrender!

58
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,586
索爾正在路上
Thor is on his way.

59
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,522
而且你無法逃脫
And you have no escape.

60
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,924
投降? Surrender?

61
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:44,328
我纔剛剛開始，奧丁
I am just getting started, Odin.

62
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:46,929
啊！Aah!

63
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:49,066
索爾! Thor!

64
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:52,102


65
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,208
啊...Ugh...

66
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,944
奧丁...Odin...

67
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,248
我警告過你
I warned you.

68
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,534


69
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,441


70
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,078
父親! Father!

71
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,748
父親! Father!

72
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,989


73
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,565


74
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:37,006
哦! 不! Oh! No!

75
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,610
父親 父親! Father. Father!

76
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:44,081
拉格...拉格納羅克
Rag...Ragnarok.

77
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,048
父親，省省你的力氣
Father, save your strength.

78
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,685
我會尋求幫助 不，不
I'll get help. No, no.

79
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:52,456
洛基...洛基要去塵世...
Loki...Loki is going to Midgard...

80
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,626
去喚醒芬利爾
to awaken Fenrir

81
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:59,329
並摧毀九洲之樹
and destroy the tree of the Nine Realms

82
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,066
然後在洛基的控制下再生！
that will then regrow in Loki's control!

83
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,836
芬利爾...芬利爾被監禁了
Fenrir...Fenrir was imprisoned.

84
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,271
永遠不會被釋放
Never to be set free.

85
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:09,573
凡人，他們不明白
The mortals, they don't understand.

86
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,143
他們不明白他們...他們釋放了什麼
They don't understand what they...they have released.

87
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,745
我該怎麼阻止它，父親？
How do I stop it, Father?

88
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,480
你需要找到...
You need to find...

89
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,917
另一半的瓦格護身符
the other half of the Vargr amulet.

90
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:22,085
如果兩半被放在一起
If the two halves are put together,

91
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:23,887
他們可以消滅大灰狼
they could destroy the Great Wolf.

92
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:28,091
你必須跟著他 你不能讓他成功
You must follow him. You cannot let him succeed.

93
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:29,560
我在哪裡可以找到護身符？
Where do I find the amulet?

94
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,929
它被送給了一個凡人的國王
It was given to a mortal king

95
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,630
許多以年前
many years ago.

96
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:39,136
即使是我...也不知道它在哪裡
Even I...do not know where it resides.

97
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:44,207
你需要找到芬利爾的墳墓！
You need to find Fenrir's tomb!

98
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,612
父親...父親？
Father...Father?

99
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,416
父親! 父親! 
Father! Father!

100
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,373


101
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,078
那是一個2.6級
That's a 2.6.

102
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,112
你怎麼認為，格雷斯，2.6級？
What do you think, Grace, 2.6.?

103
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,747
蛤? Huh?

104
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,950
那次地震 什麼地震？
That earthquake. What earthquake?

105
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:29,186
把刀柄遞給我
Hand me the hilt.

106
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,131
你為什麼一直在看那個？
Why do you keep looking at that?

107
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,667
看到這個了嗎？
See this?

108
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,905
是啊! 看起來像風箏
Yeah. Looks like a kite.

109
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,707
你認為土著美國人在
You think indigenous Native Americans are

110
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,876
放風箏嗎？這是200年前的
flying kites? Is this some kind of

111
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:55,512
體育用品店嗎？
sporting goods store from 200 years ago?

112
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,414
你能至少假裝你知道岩石雕刻嗎？
Can you at least pretend you know petroglyphs?

113
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,851
嘿，你要一位地質學家？我是你所要的人
Hey, you want a geologist? I'm your guy.

114
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:03,487
你想找人喝杯咖啡，還是你的人
You want someone to do a coffee run, still your guy.

115
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:06,957
你想要有人識別土著符號？
You want somebody to identify indigenous symbols?

116
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,726
不是你的人 顯然地
Not your guy. Clearly.

117
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:13,864
此外，這不是土著美洲人
And besides, this isn't indigenous Native Americans.

118
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,565
這是什麼? What is it?

119
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:18,835
這是大灰狼，芬利爾的象徴
This is the symbol of Fenrir, the Great Wolf.

120
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:22,572
他是個神，有能力摧毀奧丁
He was a god, with the power to destroy Odin.

121
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,576
奧丁？ 就像索爾 像那個奧丁？
Odin? Like Thor. Like that Odin?

122
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:27,844
是的 Yep.

123
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,913
而且傳說芬利爾是如此卑鄙
And legend has it that Fenrir was so mean

124
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,816
而且不受控制的他試圖開啟時代的終結
and uncontrolled that he tried to start the end of times.

125
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,585
如果他要實現他的預言，那麼他會
If he were to fulfill his prophecy, then he would

126
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:39,756
摧毀九界，併殺死奧丁和他的妻子弗裡格
destroy the Nine Realms and kill Odin and his wife, Frigg.

127
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:41,725
芬利爾怎麼了？
What happened to Fenrir?

128
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,727
他們抓住了他，並把他囚禁起來
They captured him and imprisoned him

129
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,996
永遠 for all eternity.

130
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,764
希望他不會逃跑
Let's hope he doesn't escape.

131
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,735
格雷斯 Grace.

132
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:54,504
嘿，阿德裡安 格雷斯剛剛發現了瓦爾哈拉
Hey, Adrian. Grace here just discovered Valhalla.

133
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,274
以及世界末日 這很酷，對嗎？
And the end of the world. That's pretty cool, right?

134
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,709
薩吉亞斯博士希望我們延期
Dr. Sagias wants us to hold off.

135
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,477
為什麼？他擔心
Why? Well, he's worried

136
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,245
我們正在經歷前震
that we're experiencing foreshock

137
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:04,948
導致了一場大地震
leading up to one big earthquake.

138
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:08,885
不，他-告訴薩吉亞斯博士
No, he-tell Dr. Sagias you don't know if a foreshock

139
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:11,588
除非之前發生了更大的地震，否則你不知道前震是否是前震
is a foreshock unless it's preceded by a bigger quake,

140
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:14,725
而且主要事件可能在幾個月內不會發生
and the main event may not happen for months.

141
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,426
聽著，讓我給他打電話，我會和他談談...
Look, let me just call him, I'll talk to him...

142
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,762
不，不止這些 你什麼意思？
No, it's more than that. What do you mean?

143
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:21,498
這是一連串的地震，而且它們同時發生
It's a cluster of quakes, and they've been happening

144
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:24,267
顯然遍及全世界
at the same time and apparently around the whole world.

145
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,303
不，你不可能同時發生兩次地震
No, you can't have two quakes at once,

146
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,371
更不用說一連串了
let alone a cluster of them.

147
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,907
但讓我上網，我會查一下美國地質調查局
But let me get online, and I'll check the USGS,

148
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:33,577
而且我會看看他們的地震儀，好嗎？
and I'll look at their seismographs, okay?

149
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,213
好的 Okay.

150
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,581
阿德裡安，看
Adrian, look.

151
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,226
遷移期？是啊!
Migration period? Yeah.

152
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,493
維京人 Vikings.

153
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,861
我看得出來
I can see that.

154
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:54,064
它很容易超過一千年
It's easily over a thousand years old.

155
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:55,832
阿德裡安，這就是一切
Adrian, this is everything.

156
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,368
我們可以證明維京人穿越了北美
We can prove that Vikings traveled across North America

157
00:11:58,435 --> 00:11:59,503
一路到加利福尼亞
all the way to California,

158
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,072
比任何人想像的都要早
way before anyone ever thought.

159
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,305
這可能是搶劫
It could be a plunder.

160
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,708
你知道，一個戰爭紀念品
You know, a souvenir from battle.

161
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,444
我的意思是，維京人此時已經在紐芬蘭了
I mean, Vikings were already in Newfoundland by this time.

162
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,514
那很好 但仔細看看這些岩石
That's fine. But look closely at these rocks.

163
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,784
我看到了其他符號的岩石雕刻，都是挪威文
I see petroglyphs of other symbols, all Norse.

164
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,754
這毫無意義 阿德裡安
This makes no sense. Adrian,

165
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,424
這是一座維京人的陵墓，我們衹要進去就行了
this is a Viking tomb, and we just have to get inside.

166
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,730
沒有維京人到這麼遠的西部的記錄
There's no record of Vikings making it this far west.

167
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:27,964
我知道！I know!

168
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,201
這就像...科普和馬什
This is like when...Cope and Marsh

169
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,568
發現了巨大的恐龍骨骼
discovered huge dinosaur bones

170
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:33,403
在19世紀的美國
in the United States in the 1800s.

171
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,372
沒人知道它們能走這麼遠
No one knew they could make it this far.

172
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:38,975
抱歉 我打不開它
Sorry. I can't open it

173
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,744
直到我們把一切都弄清楚
until we get the all clear.

174
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,813
我們如此近了 我們只需要打開這個墳墓
We're so close. We just have to open this tomb.

175
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,881
我會進去，我進去看看一會兒裡面
I'll go inside, I'll see inside for just a moment.

176
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:47,050
一週後我會在這裡進行實地調查
I'll get a site survey out here in a week.

177
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:48,819
我可以在不到兩週的時間內獲得認證
I can get it certified in less than two weeks.

178
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,353
兩週對一座墳墓來說沒有什麼不同
Two weeks makes no difference for a tomb

179
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,755
它在這裡已經有一千年了
that's been here for a thousand years.

180
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:53,423
我會讓我的團隊來保護這個地點
I'll get my team here to secure the site

181
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,025
所以薩吉亞斯博士更舒服
so Dr. Sagias is more comfortable.

182
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:58,061
好的 然後我們會在一週內扭轉局面
Okay. And then we'll have this turned around in a week.

183
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,632


184
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,903
大家還好嗎？
Everyone okay?

185
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:12,742
它自己打開了
It opened by itself.

186
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,647
把岩石鋸給我
Give me the rock saw.

187
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,317
我要去找人幫忙
I'm going to go get help.

188
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,418
我會和薩吉亞斯博士談談
I'll talk to Dr. Sagias.

189
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,293
嗨! 是的，我現在需要和薩吉亞斯博士談談
Hi. Yes, I need to speak to Dr. Sagias now.

190
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,694
現場是艾德裡安
It's Adrian at the site.

191
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,764
手電筒? Flashlight?

192
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,369
它是30,000流明
It's 30,000 lumens.

193
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,274


194
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,809
那是什麼嗶音？那是我
What's that beeping? That's me.

195
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,878
氫含量非常高
Hydrogen levels are really high.

196
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,012
危險嗎? Dangerous?

197
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,780
可能是門開的時候發生的
Probably happened when the door opened.

198
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,449
是的，當氫遇到氧時
Yeah, when hydrogen meets oxygen,

199
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,584
它相當具有爆炸性
it's pretty explosive.

200
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:57,121
是的-它也製造水
Yeah-it also makes water.

201
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,091
是的 Yeah.

202
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:07,131
尼克，你不會相信剛剛發生的事
Nick, you won't believe what just happened.

203
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,941
這裡沒什麼
Not much in here.

204
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:19,876
也許我們不是第一個打開它的人
Maybe we're not the first to open it.

205
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:23,413
不 維京人的陵墓不像埃及的陵墓
No. Viking tombs were not like Egyptian tombs.

206
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,448
非常基本 Very basic.

207
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,619
我很驚訝它有岩石雕刻
I'm surprised it has petroglyphs.

208
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:32,223
一定是某個特別的人
Must have been someone special.

209
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,191
或者別的什麼
Or something.

210
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,164
我沒有看到屍體
I don't see a body.

211
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:42,532
維京人通常被火化
Vikings were usually cremated.

212
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,968
所以這不是墳墓？
So this isn't a tomb?

213
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:46,503
我不知道 I don't know.

214
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,605
可能是個聖陵
Could be a shrine.

215
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,542
符號上寫了什麼？
What did the symbols say?

216
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:55,979
抱歉 Sorry.

217
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:58,215
剛剛和薩吉亞斯博士談過 他不想我們在這裡
Just talked to Dr. Sagias. He doesn't want us in here.

218
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:00,016
拜託，你現在一定在開我玩笑
Come on. You gotta be kidding me right now.

219
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:01,451
他想派一名結構工程師
He wants to send a structural engineer

220
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,520
來這裡確保它的安全
out here to make sure it's safe.

221
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,224
好的 Okay.

222
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,660
好的 Okay.

223
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:13,964
來吧，格雷斯
Come on, Grace.

224
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:17,834
知道了 Got it.

225
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,546
格雷斯，來吧!
Grace, come on.

226
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:41,958


227
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,565


228
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,734
肯定是挪威人
Definitely Norse.

229
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,535
我看到更多的狼象形文字
I see more of the wolf hieroglyphs.

230
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,536
芬利爾? Fenrir?

231
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:55,239
是的，但是...Yes, but...

232
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:57,807
我也看到了一些美洲高山族的符號
I see some Native American symbols, too,

233
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,543
比如先早 通瓦符號
like early. Tongva symbols.

234
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,712
所以，這座陵墓是一個合資企業
So, this tomb was a joint venture

235
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:05,515
界於土著部落和維京人之間？
between indigenous tribes and the Vikings?

236
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,817
做個猜測，但是...
Taking a guess, but...

237
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,487
也許這兩個團體都建造了這個
maybe both groups built this

238
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,887
因為他們都有既定的興趣
because they both had a vested interest.

239
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,922
在建造維京人陵墓？
In building a Viking tomb?

240
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:15,058
通瓦部落為什麼要這樣做？
Why would the Tongva tribes do that?

241
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,893
尊敬? Respect?

242
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,561
或者恐懼 Or fear.

243
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:20,498
看看這些符號
Look at these symbols.

244
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,632
那是瓦爾克努特，死亡的象徴
That's a Valknut, symbol of death.

245
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,735
那是伊格德拉西爾，九界之樹
That's Yggdrasil, tree of the Nine Realms.

246
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:29,140
太陽，那是壞精靈的通加語
That's Tongva for bad spirit, sun.

247
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,342
也許這不是墳墓
Maybe it's not a tomb.

248
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,477
也許是別的東西
Maybe it's something else.

249
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,413
像是什麼？Like what?

250
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,614
任何東西 Anything.

251
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,050
一個通道、一個房間、一個神龕
A passageway, a room, a shrine.

252
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,651
一個監獄 A prison.

253
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:43,220
為了狼神
For the wolf god

254
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:46,357
想要吃掉太陽，摧毀九界
that wants to eat the sun and destroy the Nine Realms.

255
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,092
住口 Stop.

256
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:53,330
兩種文化合作建造監獄 為什麼？
Two cultures teaming together to build a prison. Why?

257
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:15,685


258
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:39,210
哇，哇! 我不這麼認為
Whoa, whoa. I don't think so.

259
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:41,778
對不起，先生 不要碰我
Excuse me, sir. Do not touch me.

260
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:45,116
這是一個安全區域 我們需要看一些身份證明
This is a secure area. We need to see some I.D.

261
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,184
一些身份證明?
Some I.D.?

262
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:49,752
身份證明是什麼？你不知道我是誰嗎？
What is I.D.? Do you not know who I am?

263
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,155
先生，你可以是亞伯拉罕·林肯
Sir, you could be Abraham Lincoln

264
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,689
和約翰·威爾克斯·布斯一起走進來
walking in here with John Wilkes Booth.

265
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,858
而且我還需要身份證明
And I'd still need I.D.

266
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,129
顯然是你的一些朋友
Clearly must be some friends of yours.

267
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,632
你不負責，是嗎？
You're not in charge, are you?

268
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,502
身份證明 I.D.

269
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:07,071
別再提身份證明了
Enough with the I.D.

270
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:09,440
誰負責？
Who's in charge?

271
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:11,342
那就是尼克.薩吉亞斯博士
That'd be Dr. Nick Sagias,

272
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:14,944
奧廷卡博物館執行主任
executive director at the Odinkar Museum.

273
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,480
那個傢伙 That guy.

274
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,149
薩吉亞斯博士
Dr. Sagias.

275
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,716
帥哥 Handsome fellow.

276
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:26,055
我可以進去嗎？
May I go in?

277
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,362
我需要呈報這個 不，你不能
I need to call this in. No, you don't.

278
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,199
不，我不能 No, I don't.

279
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:41,871
午安，薩吉亞斯博士
Afternoon, Dr. Sagias.

280
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:45,708
很高興見到你
It's great to see you.

281
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,611
你想讓我帶團隊
Would you like me to get the team

282
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:49,712
並到現場見你嗎？
and meet you at the site?

283
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,748
沒有必要
Won't be necessary.

284
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,684
好的 All right.

285
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,986
聽起來不錯
Sounds good.

286
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,885
我的朋友，我在監獄裡待太久了
Been in prison far too long, my friend.

287
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:39,796
我知道你所經歷的什麼
I know what you're going through.

288
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,006
等待結束了
The wait is over.

289
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,078
我真不敢相信我錯過了那個
I can't believe I missed that.

290
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:55,512
什麼? What?

291
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,081
那是蘇利特
That's thulite.

292
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,881
這就是為什麼它有粉紅對其着色
That's why it has that pink tint to it.

293
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,518
蘇利特？是的，是挪威語
Thulite? Yeah, it's Norwegian.

294
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,420
這些是巨大的岩石
These are huge rocks.

295
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,089
他們在這裡幹什麼？
What are they doing here?

296
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,624
他們會周遊全國
Would they travel across the country

297
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,092
以成噸的蘇利特？
with tons of thulite?

298
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,059
你在加州找不到蘇利特
You can't find thulite in California.

299
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,529
不是一千年前 我是說，他們發現了一些東西
Not a thousand years ago. I mean, they found something

300
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,531
與塞爾湖相似，但很深
similar at Searles Lake, but deep.

301
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:17,534
真的很深-你需要19世紀的工程
Really deep-you'd need 19th century engineering

302
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:20,337
來粹取它 嘿，崔博士
to extract it. Hey, Dr. Choi.

303
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:22,339
早上好，哈樂德
Morning, Harold.

304
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:23,973
薩吉亞斯說他今天要來嗎？
Did Sagias say he was coming in today?

305
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,510
沒有，我剛剛和他通了電話 為什麼？
No, I just spoke to him on the phone. Why?

306
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:28,811
我很確定他在這裡
I'm pretty sure he's here.

307
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,913
什麼? 我想他在墳墓裡
What? I think he's in the tomb.

308
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,684


309
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,286
你授權使用炸藥了嗎？
Did you authorize the explosives?

310
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:38,355
我為什麼要這麼做？哈樂德，打911
Why would I do that? Harold, call 911.

311
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:43,960
尼克? 哈囉? 
Nick? Hello?

312
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:46,497
格雷斯，我覺得房間變大了
Grace, I think the room got bigger.

313
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:47,765
另一扇門開了！
Another door opened!

314
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,233
尼克! 哇，哇，哇！
Nick! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,669
有很多氫氣！我們應該在外面等
It's a lot of hydrogen! We should wait outside.

316
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:53,504
聽著，我猜這次是
Listen, my guess is this time

317
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,806
有一個揮發性的化學反應
there was a volatile chemical reaction.

318
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:58,676
另一扇門 誰在乎呢？走吧！
Another door. Who cares? Let's go!

319
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:00,177
我們在找尼克
We're looking for Nick.

320
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:02,146
不，這是一個剛剛爆炸的不穩定地點
No, this is a volatile site that just exploded

321
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:05,215
而且可能殺了某人 我們得走了
and possibly killed someone. We need to go.

322
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:07,117
他可能會受傷 崔博士？
He could be hurt. Dr. Choi?

323
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,985
急救人員正在趕來
First responders are on their way,

324
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,155
但他們有問題，因為這是一個挖掘現場
but they've got questions because it's a dig site.

325
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,057
哈囉? Hello?

326
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,360
帕特裡克，我們走
Patrick, let's go.

327
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:20,798
帕特裡克! Patrick!

328
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,232
帕特裡克...Patrick...

329
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,966


330
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:33,177


331
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:34,745
帕特裡克! Patrick!

332
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:35,945
帕特裡克! 阿德裡安
Patrick! Adrian.

333
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:37,247
帕特裡克，我們走
Patrick, let's go.

334
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:39,015
等等，那是薩吉亞斯博士
Wait, wait, that's Dr. Sagias.

335
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:41,552
哦，我的天啊!
Oh my God.

336
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,885
尼克? Nick?

337
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:45,422
別碰我 Don't touch me.

338
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:47,491
沒事的，薩吉亞斯博士
It's okay, Dr. Sagias.

339
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:48,958
你在挖掘現場
You're at the dig site.

340
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,728
那發生了爆炸
There was an explosion.

341
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:53,831
尼克，是我，阿德裡安·奎因
Nick, it's me, Adrian Quinn.

342
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,132
你...你受傷了嗎？你沒事吧？
Are you...Are you hurt? Are you okay?

343
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,966
我不需要你的幫助，好嗎？
I don't want your help, okay?

344
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,171
他們找到他了
They found him.

345
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,940
是的，他衹是有點震驚
Yeah, he's just a little stunned.

346
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,275
好了，各位，這裡不安全
All right, everybody, it's not safe here.

347
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:06,810
我們必須把所有人都救出來
We got to get everybody out.

348
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:08,345
先生? 薩吉亞斯博士
Sir? Dr. Sagias,

349
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,714
我帶你到地面，好嗎？
I'm going to lead you to the surface, all right?

350
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,250
離我遠點 你們所有的人！
Stay away from me. All of you!

351
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:17,087
尼克 是我，格雷斯
Nick. It's me, Grace.

352
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:23,527
我現在不需要你的幫助
I do not require your assistance at this time.

353
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,462
你為什麼在這裡，尼克？
Why are you here, Nick?

354
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,898
我來...I came...

355
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:31,235
親自來訪問芬利爾監獄
to visit the prison of Fenrir myself.

356
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,539
你怎麼知道這是芬利爾的監獄？
How did you know this was the prison of Fenrir?

357
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:38,275
我們需要出去外面
We need to go outside.

358
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:40,344
這個房間太不穩定了
This room is too unstable.

359
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:41,978
我們需要離開
We need to leave.

360
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,649
那很好 我和帕特裡克一起去
That's fine. I'll go with Patrick here.

361
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:48,352
你們都離開
You all leave.

362
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,422
好的 Okay.

363
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:55,459
你找到他了？我很好，很好，衹是-是的
You got him? I'm fine, fine, just-yeah.

364
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:10,541
呃-呃 Uh-uh.

365
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,911
你覺得尼克看起來不太對勁了嗎？
Did Nick seem off to you?

366
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,847
有人說他會出現在現場上
No one said anything about him showing up to the site.

367
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:18,148
他就是這樣
He's like that.

368
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:20,016
是的，但你剛剛和他談過
Yeah, but you just talked to him.

369
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,752
我和他通了電話
I talked to him on the phone.

370
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,020
他可能正在去現場的路上
He could have been on his way to the site.

371
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:26,055
對 Right.

372
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:28,192
看，尼克很古怪
Look, Nick is eccentric.

373
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,495
可能被爆炸震暈了
Could have been stunned from the blast.

374
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,400
你注意到他沒有跛行嗎？他總是拿著枴杖
Did you notice he's not limping? He always has a cane.

375
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:39,001
我的意思是，我們應該聽他說，或者至少看到他
I mean, we should have heard him or at least seen him.

376
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,904
他是怎麼從我們身邊溜過去的？
How'd he sneak past us?

377
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,474
我要打幾通電話 我不知道發生了什麼
I'm gonna make a few calls. I'm not sure what's going on,

378
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,543
但這感覺不對 我要回去
but it doesn't feel right. I'm going to go back.

379
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,445
什麼? What?

380
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,749
我衹是想知道你是否值得拯救
I was just wondering if you were worth saving.

381
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,485
你說什麼? Excuse me?

382
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:58,054
我以為你想讓我幫你離開這裡，薩吉亞斯博士
I thought you wanted me to help you out of here, Dr. Sagias.

383
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:00,824
那就幫忙吧!
Then help.

384
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:03,660


385
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:04,994
這是安全部門，我是葛列格
You reached security, this is Greg.

386
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:05,995
我能幫你什麼？
How can I help you?

387
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:07,531
是的 嗨，我是格雷斯.崔
Yes. Hi, I'm Grace Choi.

388
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:09,166
我是與薩吉亞斯合作的考古學家之一
I'm one of the archeologists working with Sagias.

389
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,701
我想知道我是否可以和他談談
I was wondering if I could speak with him.

390
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,704
恐怕薩吉亞斯博士正在開會
I'm afraid that Dr. Sagias is in a meeting.

391
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,972
你得晚點再打來
You have to call back later.

392
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,507
他正在開會？
He's in a meeting?

393
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,409
他去現場了嗎？
Did he go to the site?

394
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:23,012
沒有，我大約10分鐘前剛到他家吃午飯
No, I just buzzed in his lunch about 10 minutes ago.

395
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,482
他一整天待在博物館了
He's been at the museum all day.

396
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,519
好的 謝謝 當然
Okay. Thanks. Of course.

397
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:30,687
還有什麼我能幫忙的嗎？
Is there anything else I can help with?

398
00:24:30,754 --> 00:24:32,689
有什麼問題嗎？
Is there anything wrong?

399
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,625
你能讓他開會完後打電話給我嗎？
Could you have him call me when he's done?

400
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:36,226
告訴他這很重要
Tell him it's important.

401
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,595
當然 我會讓他馬上給你回電話
Certainly. I'll have him call you back at once.

402
00:24:38,662 --> 00:24:40,097
謝謝，葛列格
Thanks, Greg.

403
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,801
哈樂德 是的?
Harold. Yeah?

404
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,103
把你的無線電扔給我
Toss me your radio.

405
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:50,240


406
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:53,577
帕特裡克？奎因？
Patrick? Quinn?

407
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,546
聽到嗎，完畢？
Come in, over?

408
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:00,817
有人能聽到我說話嗎，完畢？
Can anyone hear me, over?

409
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,523
來吧，跟我來
Come on. Follow me.

410
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,370


411
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:25,776
這都是什麼？
What is all this?

412
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:28,312
一個哨所站
A sentry station.

413
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:35,252
警衛？為了什麼？
Guards? For what?

414
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:43,226
芬利爾 Fenrir.

415
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,164
尼克! Nick!

416
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,167
尼克，住手！終於
Nick, stop! At last.

417
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,802
住手 Stop.

418
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:55,073
對不起，像這樣的事情是有程序的
I'm sorry, but there are procedures for stuff like this.

419
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,573
我很抱歉？I'm sorry?

420
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,709
你不能只從挖掘現場拿走東西
You can't just take things from an excavation site.

421
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:00,344
我們必須記錄下來
We have to log it.

422
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,713
但更重要的是，我們現在必須離開這裡
But more importantly, we have to get out of here now.

423
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,115
薩吉亞斯博士...
Dr. Sagias...

424
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:08,051
打開骨灰盒
Open the urn.

425
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,121
尼克! 現在 打開骨灰盒
Nick! Now. Open the urn.

426
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,862
帕特裡克 帕特裡克，住手！
Patrick. Patrick, stop!

427
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,347
我不能呼吸
I can't breathe.

428
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,725


429
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:01,371
好多了 謝謝你，博士
Much better. Thank you, Doctor.

430
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:03,573
沒有你的幫助，我永遠無法
Without your assistance, I would've never

431
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,411
找回大灰狼的毒牙
been able to retrieve the Great Wolf's fang.

432
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:12,116
你不能移動它
You can't remove that.

433
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:13,917
我不明白 I don't understand.

434
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:15,519
你是誰？Who are you?

435
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,622
我的禮貌在哪裡？
Where are my manners?

436
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:20,757
為什麼，我是洛基
Why, I'm Loki.

437
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:25,328
離他遠一點
Get away from him.

438
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,197
那不是尼克
That's not Nick.

439
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:28,532
就是那個傢伙！
That's the guy!

440
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:29,933
就是那個通過我的傢伙
That's the guy that got past me.

441
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,435
你想要什麼？
What do you want?

442
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:35,106
當然，這理所應當地是我的
What's rightfully mine, of course.

443
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:37,108
他在某種程度上控制著帕特裡克
He's controlling Patrick somehow.

444
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:38,208
格雷斯，我們必須離開這裡
Grace, we got to get out of here.

445
00:27:38,275 --> 00:27:39,943
你對帕特裡克做了什麼？
What have you done to Patrick?

446
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,649
很不幸，奧丁成功了
Well, unfortunately, Odin made it

447
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:50,387
所以，上帝無法挖掘出這隻大灰狼
so that a God is unable to unearth the Great Wolf.

448
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,725
所以我需要一個凡人
So I needed a mortal,

449
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:59,163
而這裡的好博士很樂意也很能幹
and the good doctor here was willing and able.

450
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,498
而現在我有了毒牙...
And now that I have the fang...

451
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:07,270
還有一件事要做
there's just one more thing to do.

452
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:08,939


453
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,041
帕特裡克! Patrick!

454
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:14,478
不! 離開這裡！走! 
No! Get out of here! Go!

455
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:18,381
救你自己！走! 啊！
Save yourself! Go! Ah!

456
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,450
你聽到他了，救你自己
You heard him, save yourself.

457
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:23,420
走! 救你自己！走! 
Go! Save yourselves! Go!

458
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:28,024


459
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:41,271
啊！Ah!

460
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:43,974
你沒事吧？是的，我想是的
Are you okay? Yeah, I think so.

461
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:55,318
他在那裡 There he is.

462
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:03,927
我想知道你什麼時候會出現，索爾
I was wondering when you'd show up, Thor.

463
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,529
看起來你沒有想像中那麼善於
Looks like you were not as good

464
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:07,697
隱藏自己的行蹤
at hiding your whereabouts as you think.

465
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:10,300
你將為你對阿斯加德的罪行付出代價
You will pay for your crimes against Asgard.

466
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:13,436
罪行？什麼罪行？

467
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:16,740
解放這個星球？解放凡人
Liberating this planet? Freeing the mortals.

468
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:19,342
我相信是你犯的罪行，索爾
I believe you're the one committing the crime, Thor.

469
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,945


470
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:24,948


471
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:47,205
恐怕太晚了，因為芬利爾甦醒了
I'm afraid it's too late, for Fenrir is awake.

472
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:49,573


473
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,384


474
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:05,289
世界末日即將到來
The end of the world is near.

475
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,158
我必須跑走了
I must run.

476
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:09,526
不 不! 洛基！
No. No! Loki!

477
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,764
洛基！Loki!

478
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:17,834


479
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,704
你還好嗎？是的，我想是的
You okay? Yeah, I think so.

480
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:27,278
等等，格雷斯！
Wait, Grace!

481
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:29,113
等等，等等 Wait, wait.

482
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:43,927
對不起 Excuse me.

483
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:46,696
嗨，呃...Hi, uh...

484
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,269
我是，呃...格雷斯
I'm, uh...Grace.

485
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:53,304
我是格雷斯.崔博士
I'm Dr. Grace Choi.

486
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:56,506
我是這次挖掘的現場經理
I'm site manager at this excavation.

487
00:30:56,573 --> 00:30:59,243
嗯，呃-呃 Um, uh-uh.

488
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,179
那是洛基，所以...
That's Loki, so...

489
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:06,016
你一定是索爾
You must be Thor.

490
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,984
你知道我的名字？
You know of my name?

491
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,355
怎麼知道? How?

492
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:14,658
噢...錘子
Well...the hammer.

493
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,527
雷神之錘？Mjolnir?

494
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:19,562
你知道他嗎？
You know of it?

495
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,932
北歐神話是我的專長
Norse mythology is my specialty.

496
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,435
噢...Well...

497
00:31:25,502 --> 00:31:27,171
我猜，不是神話
Not mythology, I guess.

498
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:30,874
你研究了我們
You studied us.

499
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:32,909
那麼你可能知道洛基在哪裡
Then you may know where Loki is.

500
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,245
你可以幫我
You can help me.

501
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:36,880
嗯，也許？Um, maybe?

502
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:41,718
你的世界的命運取決於它
The fate of your world depends upon it

503
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:43,887
還有你對我們的了解
and your knowledge of us.

504
00:31:44,754 --> 00:31:47,158
噢，當你這樣說的時候
Well, when you put it like that.

505
00:31:50,227 --> 00:31:51,461
跟我來 Come with me.

506
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:54,965
好的 Okay.

507
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:09,679
芬利爾的毒牙 不要碰那個
The Fang of Fenrir. Do not touch that.

508
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:12,582
等等，你臉上的斑紋怎麼了？
Wait, what happened to the markings on your face?

509
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:14,684
神的戰爭畫作
War paint of the gods.

510
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:16,820
它在戰鬥中顯示出來
It manifests during battle.

511
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,526
等等-嘿！Wait-hey!

512
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,648
那是伊格德拉西爾，九界之樹
That's Yggdrasil, the tree of the Nine Realms.

513
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:46,916
你知道它？
You know of it?

514
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:48,319
是的 Yeah.

515
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:51,255
基本上每個分支都包含宇宙的一部分
Basically each branch holds a part of the universe.

516
00:32:51,322 --> 00:32:52,490
地球是它的一部分
Earth is part of it.

517
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:55,493
這就是洛基追求的
This is what Loki is after.

518
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,328
他尋找來摧毀這棵樹
He seeks to destroy the tree

519
00:32:57,395 --> 00:33:00,730
而種植一種他可以控制的新品種
and plant a new one that he could control.

520
00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:02,932
而這就是為什麼他需要芬利爾？
And that's why he needs Fenrir?

521
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,869
洛基可以摧毀這棵樹
Loki can destroy the tree.

522
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:10,141
但是攻擊每一個領域，這將是困難的
But attacking each realm, that will be difficult.

523
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:13,477
芬利爾會變得越來越強大
Fenrir will grow stronger and bigger,

524
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:15,413
而它將吞噬每一個領域
and he will devour each realm.

525
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,881
樹在哪裡？
Where's the tree?

526
00:33:17,947 --> 00:33:20,317
我父親說它在附近
My father said it's nearby.

527
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,221
當芬利爾離它太近時，他被監禁了
Fenrir was imprisoned when he got too close to it.

528
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:28,658
眾神阻止了芬利爾 我們衹是凡人
The gods stopped Fenrir. We are just mortals.

529
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:31,462
沒有人要求你這麼做
No one is asking you to do this.

530
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:33,297
我將親自接受這個挑戰
I will take on this challenge myself.

531
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,132
不，我們不能讓帕特裡剋死
No, we can't let Patrick die.

532
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,699
你的朋友是對的
Your friend is right.

533
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,902
芬利爾變得更加強大
Fenrir grows more powerful

534
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:40,670
而你的朋友，他將永遠消失
and your friend, he will disappear forever.

535
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:42,073
我們可以阻止他們
We can stop them.

536
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:46,444
這就是我喜歡你們這種人的地方
This is what I like about your kind.

537
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,777
機會對你不利
The odds are against you.

538
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:49,779
然而你們卻選擇了為彼此而戰
Yet you choose to fight for one another.

539
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:53,117
我們能和他們戰鬥嗎？不
Can we fight them? No.

540
00:33:53,184 --> 00:33:56,387
衹要告訴我他們在哪裡，我會自己和他們戰鬥
Just tell me where they are and I will fight them on my own.

541
00:33:56,454 --> 00:34:00,091
不，你需要我的幫助，我和你一起去
No. You want my help, that I'm going with you.

542
00:34:00,157 --> 00:34:01,758
我也是 Me, too.

543
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:06,696
固執、愚蠢
Stubborn, foolish.

544
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,832
但是充滿了勇氣
But full of heart.

545
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:11,268
好的 我們將一起旅行
Fine. We will travel together.

546
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:13,070
所以我們要去哪裡？
So where are we going?

547
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:17,607
洛基用瓦格護身符喚醒了芬利爾
Loki has awakened Fenrir with the Vargr amulet.

548
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,079
但他衹有一半
But he only has one half.

549
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:26,616
如果我們在他意識到他的錯誤之前找到另一半
If we find the other half before he realizes his mistake,

550
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:28,586
我們有機會阻止芬利爾
we have a chance of stopping Fenrir

551
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,287
來吞噬樹木
from devouring the tree.

552
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:32,722
所以我們必須找到另一半的護身符
So we have to locate the other half of the amulet.

553
00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:34,325
的確 Indeed.

554
00:34:36,227 --> 00:34:39,597
薩吉亞斯 是的
Sagias. Yes.

555
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,600
這是什麼？不是什麼，是誰
What is this? Not a what, who.

556
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,368
尼古拉斯·薩吉亞斯博士
Doctor Nicholas Sagias.

557
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:47,438
如果有人知道護身符的後半部分在哪裡
If anyone knows where to locate the second half of the amulet,

558
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:48,606
他知道 he does.

559
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:50,673


560
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,215
那是芬利爾
That is Fenrir.

561
00:34:58,282 --> 00:34:59,682
它此刻變得更加強大
He grows more powerful by the moment.

562
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:02,018
如果我們不阻止洛基
If we do not stop Loki,

563
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:04,921
芬利爾將勢不可擋
Fenrir will be unstoppable.

564
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:08,024
這把錘子太不可思議了
This hammer is amazing.

565
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:12,896
沒有人能揮舞雷神之錘...
No one can wield Mjolnir...

566
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:16,367
除非他們值得
unless they are worthy.

567
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:19,903
當然 Of course.

568
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:30,414


569
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:32,550
這是最令人印象深刻的輸送方式
This is the most impressive form of transportation.

570
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:35,152
你能聯繫到薩吉亞斯博士嗎？
Have you been able to reach Dr. Sagias at all?

571
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,920
嗯-嗯! Mm-mm.

572
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:40,191
我們對你們這些凡人的了解是有缺陷的
Our knowledge of you mortals is flawed.

573
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:43,826
你什麼意思？
What do you mean?

574
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,596
噢，上次我們相遇的時候
Well, the last time our paths crossed,

575
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:48,064
你有劍和船
you had swords and ships.

576
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:51,402
你最後一次在地球是什麼時候，確切地？
When was the last time you were on Earth, exactly?

577
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:53,637
早在你的時代之前
Long before your time.

578
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:55,239
我們人類已經走過了漫長的道路
We humans have come a long way.

579
00:35:55,306 --> 00:35:58,242


580
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:00,910


581
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:05,014
另一次地震？
Another quake?

582
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,116
抓穩了 Hold on.

583
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:11,854
抓穩了! Hold on!

584
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:16,627
你在做什麼？我們必須找到尼克
What are you doing? We have to get to Nick.

585
00:36:16,694 --> 00:36:19,129
我要直接開車過去 我們別無選擇
I'm gonna drive right through. We don't have another choice.

586
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:25,402


587
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:29,739


588
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:33,577
哦，太棒了
Oh, fantastic.

589
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:36,113
你會成為一個最令人畏懼的華爾基莉(奧丁神的十二婢女之一)
You would have made a most formidable Valkyrie.

590
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,947


591
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:39,916
我會認為這是一種恭維
I'll take that as a compliment.

592
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:42,852
拜託，不要再這樣做了
Please, don't do that again.

593
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:51,861
是的! 再一次，再一次，再一次 走吧！是的
Yes! Again, again, again. Let's go! Yes.

594
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:59,503


595
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,005
哈囉? 我是格雷斯.崔！
Hello? It's Grace Choi!

596
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:04,108
奎因，再嘗試聯繫一下尼克
Quinn, try and reach Nick again.

597
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:05,509
好的 Okay.

598
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:09,346
讓開 我會打開這扇門
Step aside. I will open this door.

599
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,054
抱歉 阿德裡安？
Sorry. Adrian?

600
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:20,391
薩吉亞斯正在等你 進來吧!
Sagias is just waiting for you. Come on in.

601
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:22,892
所以，這是角色扮演嗎？
So, is this a cosplay thing?

602
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,262
什麼? 那個穿著戲服的傢伙
What? The guy in the costume.

603
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,330
不 No.

604
00:37:26,397 --> 00:37:29,899
我是阿斯加德的索爾，奧丁的兒子
I'm Thor of Asgard, Son of Odin.

605
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:33,237
你當然是 薩吉亞斯博士？
Of course you are. Dr. Sagias?

606
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:35,072
哦，嘿! Oh, hey.

607
00:37:36,307 --> 00:37:41,911
所以這個...索爾，是我們的挪威神？
So is this...Thor, our Norse god?

608
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:44,315
唯一的一個
The one and only.

609
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:46,816
我知道這聽起來...不，不，不
I know it sounds...No, no, no.

610
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,854


611
00:38:08,905 --> 00:38:11,642
天的盡頭
The end of days.

612
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,843


613
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:18,248
拉格納羅克
Ragnarok.

614
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:20,551
然後呢? And?

615
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,989
所以，他知道...古老的語言
So, he knows the...the ancient tongue.

616
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,427
那並不...那並不對我來說有任何意義
That doesn't...that doesn't mean anything to me.

617
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:36,999
好的 Okay.

618
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,769
所以他是索爾 知道了
So he's Thor. Got it.

619
00:38:38,836 --> 00:38:40,604
我們在浪費時間
We are wasting time.

620
00:38:40,671 --> 00:38:42,706
你知道護身符的另一半在哪裡嗎？
Do you know where the other half of the amulet is?

621
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:48,145
我想帕特裡克是狼芬利爾的主人吧？
I assume Patrick is the human host for Fenrir the Wolf?

622
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:51,013
你怎麼...噢，他不在這裡
How did you...Well, he's not here.

623
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:54,284
如果...如果他死了，你會說些什麼
You would have said something if...if he died.

624
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:58,054
對嗎? 因為芬利爾需要一個人類宿主 對嗎?
Right? Because Fenrir needs a human host. Correct?

625
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:09,065
它們變得越來越頻繁
They are becoming more frequent.

626
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,868
芬利爾變得更加強大
Fenrir grows more powerful.

627
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,669
正如我在車裡打電話說的那樣
As I said on the phone in the van,

628
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:15,938
這就是為什麼我們需要瓦格護身符的第二片
this is why we need the second piece of the amulet of Vargr.

629
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,608
完整的護身符是唯一的東西
The full amulet is the only thing

630
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:18,975
那可以阻止芬利爾
that can stop Fenrir

631
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,511
並阻止洛基毀滅世界
and prevent Loki from destroying the world.

632
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:31,020
你知道這是什麼嗎？
So you know what it is?

633
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:38,995
跟我來 Come with me.

634
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:53,510
那是一艘埋葬船
That is a burial boat.

635
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:55,044
不是為了戰鬥？
Not meant for battle?

636
00:39:57,414 --> 00:39:59,583
用於旅行前往至瓦爾哈拉的
Meant for travel to Valhalla.

637
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,954
你不應該從他們的墳墓裡拿走這個
You should not have taken this from their tomb.

638
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:10,194
我們研究它 從它學習
We study it. Learn from it.

639
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:17,967
你們擾亂了死者，詛咒了自己
You have cursed yourselves by disturbing the dead.

640
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:24,441
那些雕像是什麼？
What are those statues?

641
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:32,583
喬蒙甘德 世界之蛇
Jormungandr. The World Serpent.

642
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:35,385
我們在早些時候的地震中幾乎失去了它們
We almost lost them in the quake earlier.

643
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:37,654
你們一到我們就把它們保護好了
We secured them as you guys arrived.

644
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:40,958
那些是展覽中最珍貴的珠寶之一
Those are one of the crown jewels of the exhibit.

645
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:44,495
喬蒙甘德是洛基的孩子
Jormungandr is a child of Loki.

646
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:51,235
你為什麼把這個被詛咒的東西放在這裡？
Why do you have this cursed thing here?

647
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:53,637
索爾！哇，哇！
Thor! Whoa, whoa!

648
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:54,838
它們必須被摧毀
They must be destroyed.

649
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:56,340
等等! Wait!

650
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:58,609
這東西非常稀有，非常有價值
Very rare and extremely valuable, this stuff.

651
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:03,580
我們是為護身符來這的
We're here for the amulet.

652
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,449
讓我們把它交給你，這樣我們就可以離開了
Let's just get it to you so we can leave.

653
00:41:06,483 --> 00:41:07,551
太棒了 Great.

654
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:33,977
來吧，芬利爾
Come, Fenrir.

655
00:41:34,043 --> 00:41:35,512
很快 Soon.

656
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,148
很快，我的孩子
Soon, my child.

657
00:41:50,894 --> 00:41:53,096
就在這裡 Right here.

658
00:41:54,798 --> 00:41:56,333
護身符 The amulet.

659
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:04,174
漂亮 Beautiful.

660
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:09,846
當我們把這兩半放在一起時，我們會阻止芬利爾
When we put these halves together, we will stop Fenrir.

661
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:11,481
現在，我們怎麼找到洛基？
Now, how do we find Loki?

662
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,584


663
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:17,387
哦，我的天哪!
Oh, my God.

664
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:20,090
我必須回家 我必須找到我的男朋友
I have to go home. I have to find my boyfriend.

665
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:22,292
這甚至可能嗎？
Is this even possible?

666
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:25,028
澳大利亞和紐西蘭
Australia and New Zealand.

667
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:26,697
海嘯正在向這裡襲來
The tsunami is heading here.

668
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:28,198


669
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:29,967
地球將發生地震
The earth will quake.

670
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:31,835
洪水會來
Floods will come.

671
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:33,503
末日將近 The end is near.

672
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:36,473
我們需要到達更高的海拔
We need to get to higher elevation.

673
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,376
我必須走了，我必須...嘿，嘿!
I have to go, I have to...Hey, hey,

674
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:41,079
你需要和我們在一起
you need to stay with us.

675
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,947
我們會一起離開
We'll leave together.

676
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:46,717
這可能太晚了
It may be too late.

677
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:48,685
萬物滅絕已經開始了
Ragnarok has begun.

678
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:54,224
芬利爾 Fenrir.

679
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,792
你為什麼受傷？
Why do you hurt?

680
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,695
我不明白，你...你不應該感到疼痛
I don't understand, you...you should not feel pain.

681
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:00,430
你不能 You can't.

682
00:43:02,733 --> 00:43:04,301
我錯過了什麼？
What am I missing?

683
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,006
發生了什麼？
What is happening?

684
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,207
發生了什麼？
What is happening?

685
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:12,342
洛基...Loki...

686
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:15,612
你犯了一個嚴重的錯誤，我的兒子
You've made a grave mistake, my son.

687
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,314
奧丁 Odin.

688
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:19,282
奧丁，你死了 我是嗎？
Odin, you are dead. Am I?

689
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:20,484
你死了，你不再是了！
You are dead, you are no more!

690
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,187
而且你在天堂
And you are in Asgard.

691
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,593
不，不，不 No, no, no.

692
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,262
衹是你更多的把戲
Just more of your tricks.

693
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:33,797
我殺了你 I killed you.

694
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,333
然而...And yet...

695
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:43,473
你站在我面前
You stand before me.

696
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:51,815
不，不，這...這隻是一個幻覺
No, no, it's...it's just an illusion.

697
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:56,887
也許我在華海拉殿的時候還沒有到
Maybe my time in Valhalla was not yet.

698
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:01,291
也許你害怕了
Maybe you're scared.

699
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:05,529
你害怕了，這就是你回來的原因
You're scared, that's why you came back.

700
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:06,897
不 No.

701
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:09,133
我回來是警告你
I came back to warn you

702
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:11,668
不要再愚蠢了
to stop this foolishness.

703
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:17,274
你的這個伎倆會適得其反
This trick of yours will backfire.

704
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:23,346
預言已經預示了
The prophecy has been foretold.

705
00:44:24,548 --> 00:44:26,150
我將在幾天結束後開始
I will start the end of days.

706
00:44:26,216 --> 00:44:29,753
在找到護身符的另一半之前
You will be dead before you find

707
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,522
你會死的
the other half of the amulet.

708
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,861
另一半？The other half?

709
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:40,764
你最終會明白這一點的
You would have figured this out eventually.

710
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:44,534
但我與你有一個交易
But I have a deal for you.

711
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:47,971
現在馬上停止這
Stop this right now

712
00:44:48,038 --> 00:44:54,044
並且來...坐在我旁邊
and come...sit beside me.

713
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:57,447
而我們將一起統治
And we shall rule together.

714
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,018
一起? Together?

715
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:08,625
你一定認為我瘋了
You must think I'm mad.

716
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:13,764
不 No.

717
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,365
世界末日已經被預言了
The end of days has been foretold.

718
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:17,768
我會贏的 I will win.

719
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:19,736
我會摧毀九界
I will destroy the Nine Realms,

720
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:23,974
而芬利爾會在天堂的大廳裡追捕你
and Fenrir will hunt you down in the halls of Asgard

721
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,410
並吃掉你的心...哦，光榮的奧丁！
and eat your heart out...oh, glorious Odin!

722
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:29,846


723
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:38,355
奧丁！奧丁！Odin! Odin!

724
00:45:40,191 --> 00:45:41,525
不! No!

725
00:46:03,114 --> 00:46:05,448
奧丁...奧丁 Odin...Odin.

726
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:09,619
來吧，芬利爾
Come, Fenrir.

727
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:12,223
我們必須找到另一半的護身符
We must find the other half of the amulet.

728
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,323
現在 Now.

729
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,891


730
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,529


731
00:46:20,964 --> 00:46:22,399
拿你能拿的一切
Grab whatever you can.

732
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:29,439
我們必須走了
We have to go.

733
00:46:29,506 --> 00:46:30,807
我知道 I know.

734
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:38,381
我們應該在這裡等 洛基來了
We should wait here. Loki is coming.

735
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:40,050
我們還有15分鐘
We have 15 minutes before

736
00:46:40,117 --> 00:46:42,519
在這整座大樓被淹沒之前
this whole building will be underwater.

737
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:43,520
請拿你能拿到的
Please just grab what you can

738
00:46:43,587 --> 00:46:44,688
而且讓我們上我的車吧!
and let's get in my car.

739
00:46:44,754 --> 00:46:46,356
洛基要來這裡
Loki is coming here.

740
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:49,025
無意冒犯，但你是不朽的
No offense, but you are immortal.

741
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:50,094
我們不是 We are not.

742
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:51,895
我們需要離開
We need to leave.

743
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:57,601
你有屬於我的東西
You have something that belongs to me.

744
00:46:57,667 --> 00:47:00,137
洛基，你在玩一個危險的遊戲
You are playing a dangerous game, Loki.

745
00:47:01,938 --> 00:47:03,740
我們需要離開 走吧!
We need to leave. Let's go.

746
00:47:03,807 --> 00:47:05,475
把護身符給我，而我保證
Give me the amulet, and I promise

747
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:08,279
你的死亡將是迅速而無痛的
your deaths will be quick and painless.

748
00:47:08,346 --> 00:47:10,614


749
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:14,951


750
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:16,519


751
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,065


752
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,505


753
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:39,409
停止這種瘋狂，洛基
Stop this madness, Loki.

754
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:44,248
決不 Never.

755
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:45,882


756
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:51,821
那些是什麼東西？
What are those things?

757
00:47:51,888 --> 00:47:53,690
看起來洛基放出他的孩子了
Looks like Loki's let out his children.

758
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:55,259
他們正在封鎖出口
They're blocking the exits.

759
00:47:55,326 --> 00:47:57,460
我們必須離開這裡，否則我們會死在這裡
We gotta get out of here, or we're going to die here.

760
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:01,498
等等 Wait.

761
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:03,800
你在做什麼？等等
What are you doing? Wait!

762
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:07,437


763
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:09,773
嘿，嘿，你在幹什麼？
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

764
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:10,840
這些都沒用
These aren't going to do anything

765
00:48:10,907 --> 00:48:12,442
對抗那些栩栩如生的哨兵
against those animated sentries.

766
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:14,678
我認為我們別無選擇
I don't think we have any other choice.

767
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,747


768
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:24,020
護身符 The amulet.

769
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,463


770
00:48:45,242 --> 00:48:46,476


771
00:48:55,885 --> 00:48:56,953
不! No!

772
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,555
洛基！Loki!

773
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:24,714


774
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:34,125
洛基去哪兒了？
Where did Loki go?

775
00:49:34,191 --> 00:49:37,428
他逃跑了，而且他擁有了兩半的護身符
He fled and he possesses both halves of the amulet.

776
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:39,263
芬利爾現在將勢不可擋
Fenrir will be unstoppable now.

777
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,630
對不起，尼克
I'm sorry, Nick.

778
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:41,898
我們必須走了
We have to go.

779
00:49:41,965 --> 00:49:43,867
海嘯隨時都會到來這裡
The tsunami will be here any minute.

780
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:45,568
如果我們留在這裡，我們會死的
If we stay here, we're going to die.

781
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:48,205
當我們到達更高的海拔時，我們會想出另一種方法
We'll figure out another way as we get to higher elevation.

782
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:49,939


783
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:36,686
現在不是你進入華海拉殿的時候
This is not your time to enter Valhalla.

784
00:50:48,165 --> 00:50:49,699
阿德裡安！Adrian!

785
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,043
我救不了她
I could not save her.

786
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:09,186
尼克 Nick.

787
00:51:14,023 --> 00:51:16,160


788
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:33,210
我們失去了她 我們失去了她，我們失去了阿德裡安
We lost her. We lost her, we lost Adrian.

789
00:51:33,277 --> 00:51:35,745
我們-我們失去了阿德裡安 我們失去了葛列格
We-We lost Adrian. We lost Greg.

790
00:51:35,812 --> 00:51:37,548
而且我們丟了護身符
And we lost the amulet.

791
00:51:37,615 --> 00:51:39,517
沒關係 It's okay.

792
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:42,253
我們失去了一切 我...無法將他們取回
We lost everything. I...can't get them back.

793
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:57,368
如果我們還能找到護身符...
If we can still find the amulet...

794
00:51:59,236 --> 00:52:01,305
你能救我們嗎？
can you save us?

795
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:02,972
太遲了嗎？
Is it too late?

796
00:52:04,108 --> 00:52:08,412
去放棄希望永遠不會太晚
It is never too late to give up hope.

797
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:11,814
一切都會好起來的 一切都會好起來的
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.

798
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:13,651
我不能這麼做
I can't do this.

799
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:15,352
我不能 I can't.

800
00:52:15,419 --> 00:52:17,053
不能把他們帶回來
Can't bring them back.

801
00:52:18,688 --> 00:52:19,923
好嗎? Okay?

802
00:52:23,494 --> 00:52:25,929
奧丁，父親 Odin, father.

803
00:52:27,464 --> 00:52:28,831
把你女兒帶回家
Bring your daughter home.

804
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,137
她等待著最後的旅程
She waits for the final journey.

805
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:38,642
她贏得了她的位置...
Has she earned her place...

806
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:41,811
或在黑暗中漫遊
Or in darkness to roam.

807
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,160
她走了 She's gone.

808
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:58,795
好嗎? Okay?

809
00:53:00,029 --> 00:53:03,733
我在這裡 你認為我們能阻止他嗎？
I'm here. Do you think we can stop him?

810
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:10,107
人類...忍受了很多痛苦
Humans...have endured a lot of suffering

811
00:53:10,174 --> 00:53:13,743
而且幾乎滅絕，但我們倖存了下來
and almost extinction but we survived.

812
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:20,184
瘟疫，饑荒，乾旱，一切
Plagues, famine, drought, everything.

813
00:53:22,051 --> 00:53:25,489
但是你知道嗎？我們存活了下來
But you know what? We survived.

814
00:53:25,556 --> 00:53:28,791
我們也會活下來
And we will survive this, too.

815
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:30,261
你必須堅持住...
You have got to hold on...

816
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:34,864
我們必須對這一切有所作為
we have got to make something of all of this.

817
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:39,136
絕對地 Absolutely.

818
00:53:40,204 --> 00:53:41,938
很好 Good.

819
00:53:47,578 --> 00:53:50,414
尼克，我們需要找到筆記型電腦
Nick, we need to find the laptop.

820
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:51,881
我知道 I know.

821
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:53,850
你找到了嗎？
Did you find it?

822
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:56,819
沒有，某些更好的
No. Something better.

823
00:53:59,819--> 00:54:01,525
這是一個象徴勇氣的北歐神符
It's a Valknut.

824
00:54:01,525 --> 00:54:03,193
奧丁的象徴
The symbol of Odin.

825
00:54:05,696 --> 00:54:09,199
你們的恆星 這是一種催化劑
Your star. It's a catalyst.

826
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:12,202
它可以打開一個用於溝通的入口
It can open a portal for communication.

827
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:18,742
這上面呢？以連接、電源
What about up here? With connection, power.

828
00:54:18,808 --> 00:54:21,010
諸如此類的事情
Things like that.

829
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:36,727
父親 父親! Father. Father!

830
00:54:36,794 --> 00:54:40,631
我想肯定以為洛基把你從我們身邊帶走了
I thought surely that Loki had taken you from us.

831
00:54:40,698 --> 00:54:43,267
我的死是不可能的
My death was not to be.

832
00:54:45,636 --> 00:54:47,638
偉大的奧丁
Mighty Odin.

833
00:54:47,705 --> 00:54:50,507
你可以來 你可以來地球幫助我們
You can come. You can come to Earth and help us.

834
00:54:50,574 --> 00:54:53,777
我們需要你 我不能 我太虛弱了
We need you. I can't. I'm too weak.

835
00:54:53,843 --> 00:54:56,313
我對這種聯繫感到驚訝
I'm amazed at this connection.

836
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,183
在這個形狀中
There should be no connection between the Realms

837
00:54:59,249 --> 00:55:00,818
王國與我之間應該沒有任何聯繫
with me in this shape.

838
00:55:00,883 --> 00:55:03,120
是的，噢，凡人
Yes, well, the mortals,

839
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:05,756
他們現在有北歐神符遺物了
they have the Valknut relic now.

840
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:09,892
一個...被遺忘很久的年代的遺物
A relic from a...a time long forgotten.

841
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:12,162
是的，是的 確實如此
Yes, yes indeed.

842
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:15,599
而洛基呢？And Loki?

843
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:17,568
他怎麼樣？What of him?

844
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:20,036
芬利爾甦醒了
Fenrir has awakened.

845
00:55:20,104 --> 00:55:22,506
而洛基擁有兩半的護身符
And Loki has both halves of the amulet.

846
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:27,411
地震正在使這個星球的核心發生動搖
Earthquakes are-are shaking this planet to its core.

847
00:55:27,478 --> 00:55:31,013
而洪水正在各地造成浩劫
And the flooding is wreaking havoc everywhere.

848
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:39,423
洛基靠近九界之樹了嗎？
Has Loki approached the tree of the Nine Realms?

849
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,225


850
00:55:42,925 --> 00:55:45,129
我不確定 I'm not sure.

851
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:53,237
那麼時間就不在你這邊了，我的兒子
Then time is not on your side, my son.

852
00:55:53,303 --> 00:55:56,407
你必須在野獸強大到足以直接吞噬   
You must kill the beast before it gets strong enough

853
00:55:56,473 --> 00:55:59,510
樹上的王國之前殺死它
to devour the realms straight from the tree.

854
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:01,712
我擔心這對他們來說要求太高了
I fear this is too much to ask of them.

855
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:06,350
他們? 對 凡人
Them? Yes. Mortals.

856
00:56:07,551 --> 00:56:09,253
道德一直陪伴著我
Morals have been accompanying me in this,

857
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:14,124
而且他們一直在勇敢地幫助別人
and they've been valiant in their efforts to help.

858
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,396
幫助是好的
Help is good.

859
00:56:20,764 --> 00:56:24,768
聽著，如果你不能收迴護身符
Listen, if you cannot reclaim the amulet,

860
00:56:24,835 --> 00:56:26,904
那隻有一種其他的方法
there is only one other way

861
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:31,442
你可以摧毀芬利爾
you can destroy Fenrir.

862
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:39,048
那能創造的也可能毀滅
That which can create may also destroy.

863
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:44,354
父親...聯繫正在減弱
Father...the connection is weakening.

864
00:56:44,421 --> 00:56:47,925
你知道，洛基在哪裡，他在哪裡？
Do you know, where is Loki, where is he?

865
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:53,996
北歐神符不夠牢固來保持聯絡
The Valknut is not strong enough to keep the connection.

866
00:56:54,063 --> 00:56:56,667
在哪裡，父親？他們在哪裡？
Where, Father? Where are they?

867
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:59,603
洛基是...和芬利爾
Loki is...with Fenrir

868
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:04,040
在維格利德，戰場
in Vigrid, the fields of battle.

869
00:57:04,107 --> 00:57:09,446
宇宙之間存在一座橋
There exists a bridge between worlds.

870
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,715
這是...It's...

871
00:57:11,782 --> 00:57:12,916
這是一個山洞
it's a cave.

872
00:57:12,982 --> 00:57:17,019
在那裡你會找到地獄的巨樹
There you will find Yggdrasil.

873
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:18,589
父親...Father...

874
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:21,925
父親! Father!

875
00:57:21,991 --> 00:57:23,961
父親，請不要走！
Father, please don't go!

876
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:25,696
我們需要你 我需要你
We need you. I need you.

877
00:57:25,762 --> 00:57:26,930
父親，求你了！
Father, please!

878
00:57:26,996 --> 00:57:28,565
求你了，父親！
Please, Father!

879
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:33,437
我父親...他還活著
My father...he's alive.

880
00:57:33,504 --> 00:57:35,572
我父親還活著！那很好，對嗎？
My father's alive! That's good, right?

881
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:38,609
是的，是的 是的 那還有希望
Yes, yes. Yes. There's still hope.

882
00:57:38,675 --> 00:57:42,779
如果我們能找到洛基和芬利爾，並打敗他們
If we can find Loki and Fenrir, and defeat them.

883
00:57:42,846 --> 00:57:44,281
所以他正在送援助？
So he's sending help?

884
00:57:44,348 --> 00:57:47,217
不，他太虛弱了
No. He's far too weak for that.

885
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:49,051
他必須先恢復體力
He must regain his strength first.

886
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,988
我們不能等了
We can't wait.

887
00:57:51,053 --> 00:57:52,890
我們有一個計畫
We have a plan.

888
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:55,158
我會找到洛基
I will find Loki.

889
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:57,227
他在哪裡？你父親告訴你了嗎？
Where is he? Did your father tell you?

890
00:57:57,294 --> 00:57:59,162
是的 是的，他告訴我了
Yes. Yes, he did.

891
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:01,832
他接近芬利爾的墓 那有一個山洞
He's near Fenrir's tomb. There's a cave.

892
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:05,502
是的，我知道，我們在哪裡做了現場調查
Yes, I know, where we did our site survey.

893
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:08,037
它在挖掘和紅杉以東幾英哩處
It's a few miles east of the dig and the sequoias.

894
00:58:08,105 --> 00:58:10,841
它在博伊登洞穴旁邊 它很深
It's by Boyden Cavern. It's very deep.

895
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:13,042


896
00:58:16,346 --> 00:58:18,382
這座建築即將倒塌
This structure is going to collapse.

897
00:58:18,448 --> 00:58:20,484
你會活下來的 我們不會
You'll survive. We won't.

898
00:58:20,551 --> 00:58:22,051
我們必須離開屋頂
We have to get off the roof.

899
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:23,887
我理解這一點
I understand that.

900
00:58:23,954 --> 00:58:25,756
但主要街道是
But Main Street is

901
00:58:25,822 --> 00:58:28,057
現在在太平洋下面
under the Pacific Ocean right now.

902
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,927
這是我們最安全的地方，就在這裡
This is our safest place, right here.

903
00:58:29,993 --> 00:58:31,295
我會去找洛基
I will go find Loki,

904
00:58:31,361 --> 00:58:32,896
我會回來接你們兩個
and I will come back for you two.

905
00:58:32,963 --> 00:58:34,531
也許我可以得到一架...
Maybe I can get one of the...

906
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:37,534
讚助人的直升機，但即使我能得到一架
benefactor's helicopters, but even if I can get one,

907
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,903
它必須離這水足夠遠
it'll have to be far enough away from this water.

908
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:43,340
等等 當然
Wait. Of course.

909
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:45,242
什麼? 你的主意
What? Your idea.

910
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:47,511
什麼主意？水
What idea? The water.

911
00:58:47,578 --> 00:58:51,281
水 我不能用這條腿游泳
The water. I can't swim with this leg.

912
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:53,650
誰說過游泳的事？
Who said anything about swimming?

913
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:11,101
你有問題嗎？
Do you have a question?

914
00:59:11,168 --> 00:59:12,636
數千 Thousands.

915
00:59:14,938 --> 00:59:16,540
你為什麼離開地球？
Why did you leave Earth?

916
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:20,544
我從未離開過地球
I never left Earth.

917
00:59:22,346 --> 00:59:23,647
我衹是不被需要
I just was not needed.

918
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:27,150
但現在你被需要了
But you're needed now.

919
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:29,753
來保護九界
To protect the Nine Realms.

920
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,154
是的 Yes.

921
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:37,227
為什麼拯救我們對你這麼重要？
Why does saving us mean so much to you?

922
00:59:38,629 --> 00:59:42,165
你的世界是九界的一部分
Your world is a part of the Nine Realms.

923
00:59:42,232 --> 00:59:44,701
而我是九界的保護者
And I am the protector of the Nine Realms.

924
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:53,477
我祖父...My grandfather...

925
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:56,013
他創造了這個世界
he created this world.

926
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,349
他為此付出了生命
He gave his life for it.

927
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:01,652
他的血肉
His flesh and blood.

928
01:00:01,718 --> 01:00:03,553
造山以及造海
Made the mountains and the sea.

929
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:08,325
我父親奧丁...
My father Odin...

930
01:00:08,392 --> 01:00:10,160
他是看守人
He was the caretaker.

931
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:14,498
這就是我遇見我心愛的希芙的地方
And this is where I met my beloved Sif.

932
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,669
啊，金髮女神
Ahh, the golden haired goddess.

933
01:00:23,006 --> 01:00:25,709
她現在在哪裡？
Where is she now?

934
01:00:25,776 --> 01:00:27,277
天堂...Asgard...

935
01:00:27,344 --> 01:00:28,712
和我父親 with my father.

936
01:00:33,784 --> 01:00:36,219
等等 你看到那了嗎？
Wait. You see that?

937
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:40,857
那裡，看到了嗎？
There, see?

938
01:00:44,128 --> 01:00:46,196
烏鴉 The Ravens.

939
01:00:46,263 --> 01:00:49,167
思想，記憶
Huginn, Muninn.

940
01:00:49,232 --> 01:00:50,400
奧丁的信使
Odin's messengers.

941
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:51,968
它們只回答他
They only answer to him.

942
01:00:52,035 --> 01:00:54,371
他說，如果可能的話，他會盡力提供幫助
He said he would try to send help if he could.

943
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:56,840
我們需要跟隨它們
We need to follow them.

944
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:58,241
你確定嗎？
Are you sure?

945
01:00:58,308 --> 01:01:02,012
我肯定 他一定知道洛基在哪裡
I'm certain. He must know where Loki is.

946
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,947
他還會再送來更多幫助嗎？
Is he sending any more help?

947
01:01:04,014 --> 01:01:06,249
我想我們需要所有能得到的幫助
I think we're going to need all the help we can get.

948
01:01:06,316 --> 01:01:07,751
我不知道
I do not know.

949
01:01:07,818 --> 01:01:10,554
送他的烏鴉可能花掉了
Sending his ravens may have spent

950
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,889
他僅剩的一點力量
what little power he has left,

951
01:01:12,956 --> 01:01:16,226
但他知道這個世界有多寶貴
but he knows how valuable this world is.

952
01:01:17,227 --> 01:01:19,496
它不能失落
It cannot fall.

953
01:01:19,563 --> 01:01:21,631
我們需要把船靠岸並開始攀爬
We need to dock the ship and start climbing.

954
01:01:21,698 --> 01:01:24,868
這次海嘯可能會帶來更多的海浪
We may get more waves with this tsunami.

955
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:26,436
我們有什麼選擇？
What choice do we have?

956
01:01:30,307 --> 01:01:31,942
你還好嗎，尼克？
You okay, Nick?

957
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:33,477
我很好 讓我們繼續前進
I'm good. Let's keep going.

958
01:01:38,182 --> 01:01:40,851
天堂像什麼?
What's Asgard like?

959
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:42,786
很像這個世界
Much like this world.

960
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:46,723
這是一件很棒的事情
It's a wonderful thing.

961
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,993
你的星球是美麗而且壯觀
Your planet is beautiful and spectacular.

962
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,230
然而洛基想摧毀它
Yet Loki wants to destroy it.

963
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:56,333
洛基不像我那樣看地球
Loki does not see Earth the way I see it.

964
01:01:56,399 --> 01:02:00,971
他將地球視為力量和控制
He sees Earth as power and control.

965
01:02:01,037 --> 01:02:04,142
有人告訴我洛基是個騙子
In the stories I was told Loki was a trickster,

966
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:07,978
一個煽動烏合之眾的人，而不是一個想摧毀王國的人
a rabble rouser, not someone who wanted to destroy the realm.

967
01:02:08,044 --> 01:02:10,847
他試圖控制王國，但實際上
He seeks to control the realms, but in reality,

968
01:02:10,914 --> 01:02:14,985
他衹是想為他的黑暗幻想找一個遊樂場
he just wants a playground for his dark fantasies.

969
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:19,723
洛基不開心，除非他欺騙了所有人
Loki's not happy unless he is tricking or deceiving everyone.

970
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,391
當他意識到自己衹是在愚弄自己時
He will not be happy when he realizes

971
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:24,128
他不會高興的
he's only fooling himself.

972
01:02:24,195 --> 01:02:25,629
希望他永遠也到不了那裡
Let's hope he never gets there.

973
01:02:25,695 --> 01:02:28,765
不幸的是，它是預先注定的
Unfortunately, it is pre-ordained.

974
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:32,170
芬利爾會長大，而它會吃掉這棵樹
Fenrir will grow, and he will devour the tree.

975
01:02:32,236 --> 01:02:35,072
洛基會殺了我父親，奧丁
Loki will kill my father, Odin.

976
01:02:35,139 --> 01:02:36,606
我以為你說過...
I thought you said that...

977
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:39,442
他注定要做這些事
He is destined for these things.

978
01:02:42,113 --> 01:02:44,815
但你在這裡 你是來阻止它的，對嗎？
But you're here. You're here to stop it, right?

979
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:46,483
是的 Yes.

980
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:49,120
但你說這是命中注定的
But you said it was preordained.

981
01:02:49,187 --> 01:02:51,888
洛基贏了 Loki wins.

982
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:54,457
每個故事都有個作者
Every story has a writer.

983
01:02:54,524 --> 01:02:57,761
每個故事都有個再生戀
Every story has a predestiny.

984
01:02:57,828 --> 01:03:00,664
但並非每個作家都是一樣的
But not every writer is the same.

985
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,499
不是每個故事都一樣
Not every story is the same.

986
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:04,101
所以有機會
So there's a chance

987
01:03:04,168 --> 01:03:06,436
洛基的故事並沒有按他希望的方式結束
Loki's story doesn't end the way he wants it to.

988
01:03:07,404 --> 01:03:08,805
現在你明白了
Now you are getting it.

989
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:13,577
好嗎，博士？很好
Okay, Doctor? Fine.

990
01:03:13,643 --> 01:03:16,746
我們可以回來接你 不
We can come back for you. No.

991
01:03:16,813 --> 01:03:18,682
我很好 I'm okay.

992
01:03:18,748 --> 01:03:20,750
我可以背著你
You can get on my back.

993
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:23,620
呃，不，我沒事 謝謝
Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.

994
01:03:23,687 --> 01:03:26,456
胡說，來吧!
Nonsense, come on.

995
01:03:26,523 --> 01:03:29,426
好的 我們開始吧! 是的
Okay. Here we go. Yeah.

996
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:32,129
好的 索爾背著我
All right. Thor is carrying me.

997
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:35,498
這就是我們正在做的
That's what we're doing.

998
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:41,872
哦，是的 Oh, yep.

999
01:03:44,007 --> 01:03:46,042
謝謝你 不客氣，朋友
Thank you. You're very welcome, friend.

1000
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:49,146


1001
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:50,914
烏鴉 The Ravens.

1002
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:52,883
它們說洛基在這邊
They're saying Loki is this way.

1003
01:03:55,518 --> 01:03:57,255
我看不到另一個入口
I don't see another entrance.

1004
01:03:57,321 --> 01:03:58,555
還有別的路進去嗎？
Is there another way in?

1005
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:02,626
讓我跟你談一下
Let me speak to you for a minute.

1006
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:05,462
真的? 現在，在這裡？是的，是的 馬上
Really? Now, here? Yeah, yeah. Right now.

1007
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:07,397
我們在這裡不屬於我們的聯盟
We're out of our league here.

1008
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:08,932
我們將會幫忙
We're going to help.

1009
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:11,668
我們在和眾神玩，以及他們的遊戲
We're playing with the gods, and their games.

1010
01:04:11,735 --> 01:04:12,969
我們衹是凡人
We're just mortals.

1011
01:04:13,036 --> 01:04:15,672
我理解 不，你不理解 
I understand. No, you don't.

1012
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:17,874
洛基一個人就夠危險的了
Loki's dangerous enough on his own.

1013
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:22,079
但是芬利爾，這隻狼，完全是另一回事
But Fenrir, this wolf, it's a whole 'nother thing.

1014
01:04:22,146 --> 01:04:23,680
我們有索爾
We have Thor.

1015
01:04:25,283 --> 01:04:29,353
萬物滅絕 這是我們所知道的世界末日
Ragnarok. It's the end of the world as we know it.

1016
01:04:29,419 --> 01:04:31,888
這不是百分之百 足夠近
It's not 100%. Close enough.

1017
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:35,159
這對我來說已經足夠了，嘿!
That's enough for me to try hey.

1018
01:04:35,226 --> 01:04:37,727
正如我的老導師曾經告訴我
As my old mentor used to tell me,

1019
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:39,496
我們必須解決這個問題
we have to make this matter.

1020
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:43,900
等等 Wait.

1021
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:46,469
洛基在裡面 我能感覺到
Loki's in there. I can sense it.

1022
01:04:46,536 --> 01:04:48,438
走開 Move away.

1023
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:03,954
跟我來，我能看到路
Stay with me. I can see the way.

1024
01:05:19,602 --> 01:05:21,205
沒有羞恥感
There's no shame.

1025
01:05:21,272 --> 01:05:22,639
你已經走了這麼遠
You've gotten this far.

1026
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,675
不 No.

1027
01:05:25,742 --> 01:05:28,545
不，讓我們去踢一些北歐神的屁股，好嗎？
No, let's go kick some Norse god's ass, shall we?

1028
01:05:30,081 --> 01:05:31,614
來吧! Come on.

1029
01:06:02,979 --> 01:06:04,981
它是九界之樹
It's the Tree of Nine Realms.

1030
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,422
九界之樹威力非常強大
The Tree of Nine Realms is very powerful.

1031
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:15,058
洛基需要他所有的魔法和技巧來摧毀它
Loki will need all his magic and tricks to destroy it.

1032
01:06:15,126 --> 01:06:17,761
而一旦他摧毀了它呢？
And once he destroys it?

1033
01:06:17,827 --> 01:06:19,629
他會種一個新的
He will plant a new one.

1034
01:06:19,696 --> 01:06:21,365
一個他可以控制的
One that he can control.

1035
01:06:21,432 --> 01:06:24,768
然後他將控制宇宙中的所有領域
And then he will control all the realms in the universe.

1036
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:27,138
我們如何阻止這一切？
How do we stop this?

1037
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,575
你不能 You don't.

1038
01:06:34,412 --> 01:06:36,046
你太遲了 You're too late.

1039
01:06:36,113 --> 01:06:38,581
芬利爾，殺了他們！
Fenrir, kill them!

1040
01:06:38,648 --> 01:06:40,884
去，現在！Go, now!

1041
01:06:42,286 --> 01:06:43,586
來吧，索爾 Come on, Thor.

1042
01:06:43,653 --> 01:06:44,587


1043
01:06:44,654 --> 01:06:46,923


1044
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:49,793


1045
01:06:53,763 --> 01:06:55,266


1046
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:07,211
尼克? Nick?

1047
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:08,945
來吧! Come on.

1048
01:07:09,012 --> 01:07:10,381
尼克! Nick!

1049
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:12,283
回到這裡 Back here.

1050
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:13,284
你沒事吧？Are you okay?

1051
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:15,585
是的，是的，我想是的
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1052
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:18,822
你看到索爾了嗎？
Do you see Thor?

1053
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:21,691
沒有 No.

1054
01:07:23,494 --> 01:07:25,929
格雷斯...Grace...

1055
01:07:25,995 --> 01:07:28,064
你知道他是個神，對吧？
You know he's a god, don't you?

1056
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:29,732
誰會受傷
Who can get hurt.

1057
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,601
我們必須找到他
We have to find him.

1058
01:07:35,038 --> 01:07:37,841
岩石是鬆散的 我想我們有一條出路
The rocks are loose. I think we have a way out.

1059
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:40,277
我們得快點 好的，我們走吧!
We have to hurry. Okay, let's go.

1060
01:07:47,617 --> 01:07:49,186


1061
01:07:52,722 --> 01:07:54,358


1062
01:08:04,868 --> 01:08:07,036
哦，那傷口看起來很嚴重的，索爾
Oh, that wound looks nasty, Thor.

1063
01:08:07,104 --> 01:08:08,771
我希望它不會傷的太嚴重
I hope it doesn't hurt too much.

1064
01:08:09,873 --> 01:08:12,742
我不需要我的閃電
I do not need my lightning.

1065
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:14,878
我可以用我的錘子打敗你
I can defeat you with my hammer.

1066
01:08:16,413 --> 01:08:17,981
芬利爾！Fenrir!

1067
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,884


1068
01:08:24,288 --> 01:08:26,022


1069
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:35,199


1070
01:08:44,741 --> 01:08:45,975


1071
01:08:47,478 --> 01:08:49,913
感受我的力量，索爾！
Feel my power, Thor!

1072
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:00,124
適可而止 Enough is enough.

1073
01:09:05,462 --> 01:09:06,530


1074
01:09:06,597 --> 01:09:08,465
你在這 There you are.

1075
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:10,201
索爾！Thor!

1076
01:09:20,144 --> 01:09:22,079
尼克，我們得做點什麼
Nick, we have to do something.

1077
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:35,192
夠了這些愚蠢的舉動，凡人
Enough with this nonsense, mortals.

1078
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:37,094
你贏不了！
You cannot win!

1079
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:38,962
結束了 It's over.

1080
01:09:39,028 --> 01:09:41,064
我有完整的護身符
I have the complete amulet.

1081
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:44,268
控制九界和大狼
Control of the Nine Realms and the Great Wolf

1082
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:45,902
又是我的了
is mine once again.

1083
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:51,808
如果你不介意的話，我有一棵樹要種
If you don't mind, I have a tree to plant.

1084
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:08,092
索爾，我的兒子
Thor, my son.

1085
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:09,859
醒來 Awake.

1086
01:10:12,463 --> 01:10:13,564
我在哪裡？Where am I?

1087
01:10:13,631 --> 01:10:15,499
這是什麼地方？
Where is this place?

1088
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:20,437
你不認識你的家？
You don't recognize your home?

1089
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:25,842
我的家？My home?

1090
01:10:27,211 --> 01:10:28,911
我的家 My home.

1091
01:10:30,281 --> 01:10:32,849
這是許多可能性之一
This is one of many possibilities.

1092
01:10:32,915 --> 01:10:36,186
但衹有一個是真實的
But only one can be real.

1093
01:10:36,253 --> 01:10:40,790
而那取決於你，以及你的決定
And that is up to you, and what you decide.

1094
01:10:48,565 --> 01:10:50,534
他們勢不可擋，父親
They are unstoppable, Father.

1095
01:10:54,271 --> 01:11:00,810
父親，我還能做什麼我還沒有做到的？
Father, what more can I do that I've not already done?

1096
01:11:04,648 --> 01:11:06,949
洪水 The floods.

1097
01:11:07,016 --> 01:11:10,621
洪水幾乎吞噬了地球
The floods have nearly consumed the earth.

1098
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:13,457
而因為我的失敗，這棵樹幾乎死了
And the tree is almost dead because of my failure.

1099
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:18,095
他們可能近了，但地球並沒有消失
They may be near, but the earth is not lost.

1100
01:11:19,496 --> 01:11:23,833
當地球人繼續戰鬥時，你為什麼認為失敗？
Why do you consider defeat when the Earthlings fight on?

1101
01:11:25,001 --> 01:11:27,970
他們可能有自己的問題
They may have their problems,

1102
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:32,543
但當他們面對死亡時
but when they're faced with death,

1103
01:11:32,609 --> 01:11:35,412
他們迎頭衝了進來
they rush in head on.

1104
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:40,484
他們會毫無顧慮地為正確的事業而死
They will die for the right cause without worry.

1105
01:11:41,418 --> 01:11:43,920
我們可以從他們身上學到很多
We could learn a lot from them.

1106
01:11:43,986 --> 01:11:47,558
你是天堂的索爾
You are Thor of Asgard.

1107
01:11:48,525 --> 01:11:51,662
奧丁的兒子
Son of Odin.

1108
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:55,265
一個偉大，偉大的戰士
A great, great warrior.

1109
01:11:55,332 --> 01:12:02,106
雷和電在你的召喚下
Thunder and lightning beckon at your call.

1110
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:08,812
我的力量不再回應我
My power no longer answers to me.

1111
01:12:08,878 --> 01:12:11,248
你的力量沒有離開你，我的兒子
Your power has not left you, my son,

1112
01:12:11,315 --> 01:12:16,253
它剛剛被芬利爾咬壞了
it has just been corrupted by Fenrir's bite.

1113
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,923
沒有它我就不夠強壯
I am not strong enough without it.

1114
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:24,261
你不需要打敗洛基
You don't need to defeat Loki.

1115
01:12:24,328 --> 01:12:29,333
萬物滅絕和野獸躺在一起
Ragnarok lies down with the Beast.

1116
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,301
它總是這樣
It always has.

1117
01:12:31,368 --> 01:12:35,572
那野獸沒有弱點！
That beast has no weakness!

1118
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:39,343
萬物都有弱點，我的兒子
Everything has a weakness, my son.

1119
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:43,946
我不會把這項任務委託給你的
I would not have entrusted you with this task

1120
01:12:44,013 --> 01:12:48,050
如果我認為你做不到的話
if I did not think that you could do it.

1121
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:52,689
記住你是誰
Remember who you are.

1122
01:12:52,756 --> 01:12:55,592
並記住你所擁有的
And remember what you have.

1123
01:12:56,794 --> 01:13:00,731
沒有你的力量我做不到，父親
I cannot do this without your strength, Father.

1124
01:13:00,798 --> 01:13:02,499
這是不可能的
It is impossible.

1125
01:13:02,566 --> 01:13:05,636
我的力量
My strength has

1126
01:13:05,702 --> 01:13:09,506
一直並將永遠與你同在
and always will be with you.

1127
01:13:09,573 --> 01:13:13,210
等等，爸爸，拜託 父親，請不要走
Wait, Father, please. Please don't go, Father.

1128
01:13:13,277 --> 01:13:16,079
請稍等，父親
Please wait, Father.

1129
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:18,081
沒關係，我的兒子
It's all right, my son.

1130
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:21,218
你衹有很短的路要走
You only have a short way to go.

1131
01:13:21,285 --> 01:13:23,854
地球需要你
The earth needs you.

1132
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:27,291
你的朋友們，他們需要你
Your friends, they need you.

1133
01:13:27,357 --> 01:13:32,129
他們繼續戰鬥，但無法打敗洛基
They fight on, but they cannot defeat Loki.

1134
01:13:32,196 --> 01:13:38,067
他們需要雷神索爾
They need Thor, the God of Thunder.

1135
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:43,240


1136
01:13:52,716 --> 01:13:54,050


1137
01:14:05,629 --> 01:14:07,531


1138
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:24,147
索爾，住手！
Thor, stop this!

1139
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:25,782
接受失敗 Accept defeat.

1140
01:14:25,849 --> 01:14:27,317
決不 Never.

1141
01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:30,254
那麼我會讓它成為一個快速而無痛地死去
Then I will make it a quick and painless death.

1142
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:34,157
芬利爾，摧毀他！
Fenrir, destroy him!

1143
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:37,427
索爾，毒牙！
Thor, the fang!

1144
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:44,167


1145
01:14:51,508 --> 01:14:52,643
帕特裡克！Patrick!

1146
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:08,225
你殺了芬利爾
You have killed Fenrir.

1147
01:15:09,192 --> 01:15:11,662
你殺了我的狼！
You have killed my wolf!

1148
01:15:11,728 --> 01:15:13,463


1149
01:15:15,465 --> 01:15:19,102
大地依然屹立，兄弟
The earth still stands, brother.

1150
01:15:19,169 --> 01:15:20,571
你沒有贏
You have not won.

1151
01:15:20,637 --> 01:15:22,306
你還在嘲笑我！
You still mock me!

1152
01:15:26,376 --> 01:15:30,047
我可能已經失去了王國，但我會復仇的
I may have lost the realms, but I will have vengeance.

1153
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:34,017
我會永遠殺了你
I will kill you once and for all.

1154
01:15:34,084 --> 01:15:36,453
你殺不了奧丁
You couldn't kill Odin.

1155
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,355
兄弟，你殺不了我的
Brother, you will not kill me.

1156
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:41,391
奧丁走了 奧丁死了
Odin is gone. Odin is dead.

1157
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:44,328
奧丁衹是一個幻覺！
Odin is but an illusion!

1158
01:15:47,364 --> 01:15:49,499
哦，愚蠢的兄弟
Oh, stupid brother.

1159
01:15:49,566 --> 01:15:51,868
你覺得我們是怎麼找到這個地方的？
How do you think we found this place?

1160
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:58,809
即使被削弱了，奧丁還是設法打敗了你
Even weakened, Odin has managed to defeat you.

1161
01:16:03,447 --> 01:16:07,351
即使有你的計畫以及你的力量...
Even with your planning, and your power...

1162
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:10,787
小心 而且你已失敗了
Careful. And you have failed.

1163
01:16:12,422 --> 01:16:15,892
因為那是你的命運，兄弟
Because that's your destiny, brother.

1164
01:16:18,795 --> 01:16:21,331
你總是會失敗！
You will always fail!

1165
01:16:21,398 --> 01:16:25,502
衹要有人反對你
As long as there is someone to oppose you.

1166
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:29,906
不 No.

1167
01:16:29,973 --> 01:16:31,908
不，不！No, no!

1168
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:36,480


1169
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:42,753


1170
01:16:46,456 --> 01:16:49,893
地球永遠不會落到像你這樣的人手裡
Earth will never fall to the likes of you.

1171
01:17:01,672 --> 01:17:03,173
為何? How?

1172
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,676
你衹是一個凡人！
You are but a mortal!

1173
01:17:07,044 --> 01:17:09,212
為何? How?

1174
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:16,420
投降而我會饒了你的命，兄弟
Surrender and I will spare your life, brother.

1175
01:17:16,486 --> 01:17:19,623
饒了我？是的
Spare me? Yes.

1176
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:24,494
饒了我，噢! 兄弟 別跟我胡說八道了
Spare me, oh brother. Spare me this nonsense.

1177
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:27,597
請住手，兄弟，拜託
Please stop, brother, please.

1178
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:28,932
那又怎麼樣？
So what?

1179
01:17:28,999 --> 01:17:31,201
我可以在監獄裡腐爛
I can rot in that prison

1180
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,670
為了你無用的父親？
for your worthless father?

1181
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:36,940
住手 住手Stop. Stop.

1182
01:17:37,007 --> 01:17:39,443
不，再也不會了 決不!
No, never again. Never!

1183
01:17:39,509 --> 01:17:42,146
不! 到此為止，兄弟！
No! This ends here, brother!

1184
01:17:42,212 --> 01:17:44,448
不! No!

1185
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:50,987
洛基！Loki!

1186
01:17:52,289 --> 01:17:54,192
兄弟! Brother!

1187
01:18:10,108 --> 01:18:11,475
格雷斯 Grace.

1188
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:15,512
格雷斯-格雷斯
Grace-Grace.

1189
01:18:17,748 --> 01:18:19,449
結束了嗎？Is it over?

1190
01:18:21,085 --> 01:18:22,853
洛基是...Is Loki...

1191
01:18:22,919 --> 01:18:25,288
洛基死了 Loki is dead.

1192
01:18:25,355 --> 01:18:27,225
結束了 It is over.

1193
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:29,493
來，我們走
Come, let's go.

1194
01:18:30,327 --> 01:18:33,730
你的錘子，它很重
That hammer of yours, it's pretty heavy.

1195
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:37,300
格雷斯，你是一個真正的戰士
You are a true warrior, Grace.

1196
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:39,770
衹有有價值的人才可以揮舞雷神之錘
Only the worthy can wield Mjolnir.

1197
01:18:42,405 --> 01:18:44,708
尼克 Nick.

1198
01:18:44,775 --> 01:18:46,643
尼克! Nick!

1199
01:18:50,714 --> 01:18:52,516
結束了 It is over.

1200
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:54,551
我們阻止了萬物滅絕
We stopped Ragnarok.

1201
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:57,320
那現在怎麼辦？
So what now?

1202
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:07,798


1203
01:19:11,635 --> 01:19:13,970
我以為你殺了芬利爾
I thought you killed Fenrir.

1204
01:19:14,037 --> 01:19:15,639
它應該死了！
He should be dead!

1205
01:19:16,873 --> 01:19:18,276
帕特裡克 Patrick.

1206
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:20,043
格雷斯! Grace!

1207
01:19:21,578 --> 01:19:24,347
你沒事吧？Are you okay?

1208
01:19:24,414 --> 01:19:26,416
我們需要把他弄出去
We need to get him out of here.

1209
01:19:26,483 --> 01:19:27,984
他需要一個醫生

1210
01:19:29,253 --> 01:19:30,787
哦，很高興見到你
Oh, good to see you.

1211
01:19:33,557 --> 01:19:35,992
地球還好嗎？
Is Earth okay?

1212
01:19:36,059 --> 01:19:37,794
它是 It is.

1213
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:39,629
至少現在是這樣
At least for now.

1214
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,701
這是個好兆頭
That's a good sign.

1215
01:19:46,237 --> 01:19:47,971
確實是個好兆頭

他們叫我回到天堂的家
They call me home to Asgard.

1217
01:19:52,742 --> 01:19:54,711
我們還會再見到你嗎？

1218
01:19:56,513 --> 01:19:58,949
如果你需要我，我會回來的

你的世界是在我的保護之下

1220

你說的是真的嗎？
Did you mean what you said?

1221
01:20:04,788 --> 01:20:07,691
關於華海拉殿的阿德裡安和葛列格？

仍然是一團糟
Still a mess.

1225
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,870
今天這裡有很多人喪生

01:20:39,257 --> 01:20:41,259
是時候了 It is time.

1232
01:20:41,325 --> 01:20:43,460
退後 Stand back.

1233
01:20:48,064 --> 01:20:50,066

所以我今天遇到了一個神

那比我的薪水等級高
That's above my pay grade.

1236
01:20:54,105 --> 01:20:56,173
老兄，那傢伙太棒了
Man, that guy's awesome.

1237
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:03,147
是的，他是 Yeah, he is.

1238
01:21:18,929 --> 01:21:21,498


1239
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,535
索爾! Thor!

1240
01:21:30,874 --> 01:21:32,876


1241
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:36,446


1242
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:50,161
父親 Father.

起來，我的兒子 起來

那你兄弟洛基呢？
And what of your brother, Loki?

1245
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:13,217
父親，他是...
Father, he is...

1246
01:22:13,284 --> 01:22:14,684
他死了 he is dead.

1247
01:22:16,187 --> 01:22:18,122
他讓我別無選擇
He left me no choice.

1248
01:22:18,189 --> 01:22:20,424
他不願屈服
He would not yield.

1249
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,159
如果我沒有阻止他
If I had not stopped him,

1250
01:22:22,226 --> 01:22:24,527
他會摧毀九界
he would have destroyed the Nine Realms.

1251
01:22:27,431 --> 01:22:28,798
我早該知道的
I should have known.

1252
01:22:30,234 --> 01:22:31,668
他是個傻瓜
He was a fool.

1253
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:36,773
但他是我的兄弟，而我非常愛他
But he was my brother, and I loved him dearly.

1254
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,842
然而...Still...

1256
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:44,848
地球人是一個有彈性的民族

在危機時刻，他們走到一起

1258

來幫助他們的同伴

1259
01:22:50,354 --> 01:22:54,358
多虧了你，他們纔有機會重建

1260
01:22:54,425 --> 01:22:57,694
地球人和天堂

1261
01:22:57,761 --> 01:23:00,930
將永遠欠你的債

1262
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:05,635
哦，父親，我...

1263
01:23:05,702 --> 01:23:07,971
我不忍心告訴凡人
I did not have the heart to tell the mortals

1264
01:23:08,038 --> 01:23:11,975
芬利爾仍然活在這個護身符裡
that...Fenrir still lives in this amulet.

1265
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:16,113
他的靈魂永遠
His soul forever.

1266
01:23:22,018 --> 01:23:24,121


1267
01:23:26,556 --> 01:23:31,162
所有這些都是預言
All of this was prophesized,

1268
01:23:31,228 --> 01:23:33,663
而結局是
and the end was

1269
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:38,635
因為我們所有的決定
because of all of our decisions.

1270
01:23:41,505 --> 01:23:43,140
來 Come.

為九界歡樂吧...

1274
01:23:54,385 --> 01:23:57,020
索爾! Thor!

1275
01:23:57,088 --> 01:23:58,289
敬天堂! To Asgard!

1276
01:23:58,355 --> 01:24:00,257
敬天堂! To Asgard!

1277
01:24:00,324 --> 01:24:03,394
敬天堂，我的兒子
To Asgard, my son.

1278
01:24:03,461 --> 01:24:05,028
是的，父親 Yes, Father.

1279
01:24:09,533 --> 01:24:11,868


1280
01:24:11,935 --> 01:24:15,272


1281
01:24:21,178 --> 01:24:25,014
