00:00:00,143 --> 00:00:04,674
MARVEL PRESENTS

2
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:09,377
THOR : LOVE AND THUNDER 2022

3
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:14,364
TRANSLATED BY WHITE GOLD

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:19,776
These subtitles are incomplete due to low sound quality, difficult to understand, and only entertained by those who want a fast translation.

5
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:24,451
If anyone is able to re -translate, welcome.

6
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,766
Oh my god

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:40,500
Almighty, help us

8
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:43,374
I don’t want help for myself

9
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,535
I want it for my daughter

10
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,045
I'm tired

11
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,841
Oh look what we have here

12
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:27,478
Look at that

13
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:29,990
How did he eat my fruit wildly?

14
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,054
forgive me

15
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,158
Oh, one of my followers

16
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,375
I am a grave

17
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,305
From your last student

18
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,055
We lost everything, sir

19
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,007
dry land

20
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,255
All life is lost

21
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,808
But I believe you

22
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,856
We don’t need your words any more than now

23
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,950
The promise of eternal reward

24
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,318
That’s why you celebrate

25
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:07,263
He thinks there is an eternal award

26
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:13,047
no no sorry

27
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:16,540
There is no permanent reward for you, dog

28
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:19,741
What we celebrate is that we only kill one

29
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,087
We have just released the Necrosword handle

30
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:27,130
Because with that cursed sword, he can hurt other gods

31
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:29,940
He threatened to end my kingdom

32
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,578
but sir

33
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,459
Your kingdom is over

34
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:37,435
There is nothing more to adore you

35
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,816
There are more followers to replace you

36
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:41,739
always there

37
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,279
We suffer

38
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:46,657
And we starved to death

39
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,575
My daughter died

40
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,241
for you

41
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:58,613
And I have to suffer for your god as your only goal

42
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,934
There is nothing for you after death

43
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:02,759
except death

44
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,049
You are not god

45
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:14,179
I deny your trust

46
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,624
... now your life is worthless

47
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:24,830
He finally met his goal

48
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,002
sacrifice yourself for me

49
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:35,686
Kill all the gods

50
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,847
Do this forever (another meaning is to do this for Eternity) (Eternity is one of the most immortal and powerful comic creatures)

51
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,275
Get your revenge

52
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,665
Open Bifrost for Eternity (rainbow bridge that takes people everywhere)

53
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:49,494
Unlock Bayfrost for Immortality

54
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,329
The sword chooses you

55
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,532
You are now cursed

56
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,366
It feels like

57
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,643
I don’t feel that I have been cursed

58
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,014
It's like a promise

59
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,438
...Well, this is my oath

60
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,220
All the gods will die

61
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:46,411
Let's get together

62
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:49,538
Listen to the legend walk in space

63
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:52,379
Held God of Lightning

64
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:55,340
Named Thor, son of Odin

65
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,959
Raised in the manner of a fighter

66
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,668
Thor has been taught to help them win the war

67
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:16,681
It grows and grows and grows

68
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,412
It's as sensitive as a smile

69
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:22,610
And she loves everyone with the passion she has

70
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,964
And once again he falls in love with a werewolf

71
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:31,642
On the female wolf

72
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:34,896
But Thor’s true love is worldly women

73
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:37,005
For Jane Farder's side

74
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,979
But Jane Foster is not like that

75
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:41,084
but unfortunately

76
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:43,616
In the battle of love, Thor loses

77
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,274
In fact, he lost a lot that day

78
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,671
her mother

79
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,189
her father

80
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:54,786
And that man And that man and whoever he is

81
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,264
and Heimdall

82
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,893
and his brother

83
00:08:57,918 --> 00:08:59,730
And again his brother

84
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,526
and more

85
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:05,754
Poor Thor got to see his planet explode

86
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,454
And then he said what did I do?

87
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,159
And apparently he lost everyone and everything he loved

88
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,970
And then he put his heart behind a big fleshy body

89
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,572
can no longer be resolved

90
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:19,975
And only because he has let go of love

91
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,116
That doesn't mean he stopped fighting

92
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,667
Team up with Guardians of the Galaxy

93
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,119
And start a series of classic Thor adventures

94
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,317
His body became

95
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,154
He gave himself a hard time

96
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:34,000
He made wealth out of suffering

97
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,356
And he never leaves a leg training day (They always make this joke with Chris Hemsworth because of his small legs)

98
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,535
of his body

99
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,220
He took himself to the statue of the Gods

100
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,614
And behind the statue of his god

101
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,515
He was just a sad person who wanted to get out

102
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:51,149
Because in all the structures he has had for years

103
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,116
He could not express the pain he was suffering unless he hid it inside them

104
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,618
So, he gave up looking for love

105
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,145
And he accepted that it was only good for one thing

106
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,484
Waiting for someone in a quiet and quiet place: Stay and tell him

107
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:10,192
Thor, we need your help to win this war

108
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:15,166
Thor, we need your help to win this war

109
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:16,821
let's go

110
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:19,039
All right, come on Stormbreaker

111
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:23,717
How are you?

112
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:25,346
People are dying

113
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:27,687
See you down there

114
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,454
Don't move anymore

115
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:44,579
Let me see

116
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:46,226
You can solve it now

117
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,153
I'm Grot

118
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:50,083
Oh, you juice everywhere

119
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,589
Hi all

120
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:55,644
See who's coming

121
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,396
How are you all

122
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,029
The situation is serious

123
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:00,399
we are dying

124
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,838
You said that the planet was supposed to be a relaxing trip

125
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,851
I said it would be a relaxing trip

126
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:09,337
. . .

127
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,060
What do you want more relaxed than this?

128
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:12,909
A real vacation

129
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,492
God of thunder and lightning

130
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:20,991
Shah Yerkan |

131
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:23,365
You finally joined our battle

132
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,002
Well, as they say, being late is better than not at all

133
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:27,674
thank you

134
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:31,195
As you know, we used to live in peace

135
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,277
But you know, god was killed

136
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:34,265
to be killed?

137
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,489
And now our holy temple is left unattended

138
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,460
They control it

139
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,022
And that is our holiest temple

140
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,118
This is rude

141
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:45,143
This disrespect will not last long

142
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:48,709
Shah Yerkan |

143
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:50,876
Tell them what happened here today

144
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,377
Tell them the story of Thor

145
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,056
...

146
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,503
...

147
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,480
Maybe the situation is the opposite for us

148
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:06,806
But let me tell you that - let's go -

149
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:11,009
The story ends here and now

150
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:07,816
People who don’t want to leave the temple? Do you want to do this?

151
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:20,871
All good work

152
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:24,530
We can get the honor of this work together because we are such a team

153
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,777
We use our minds and hearts to defeat the enemy

154
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,580
Wow, the classic adventure has been a revolution

155
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,148
Foster's theory of time travel and space

156
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:05,273
your book

157
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:06,892
Well?

158
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:08,668
i wrote it

159
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,562
Are you Dr. Jane Foster?

160
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:13,677
yes

161
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:15,648
hai hai -

162
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:17,704
What about Paul Rosen Einstein?

163
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:20,122
difficult. very difficult - yes -

164
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,988
Have you watched the movie Event Horizon?

165
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:25,013
Not

166
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,755
What is interstellar? - Not -

167
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,722
He might explain everything to you

168
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:32,281
Um, very good. Paul Rosen Einstein's theory says that

169
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,820
If there are points A and B in space

170
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,980
which has a similar existence

171
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,250
This way

172
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:43,881
You tore your book

173
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:45,958
Yes, but now you understand the wormhole problem

174
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:49,542
Make sure you watch the movie

175
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,035
Well -

176
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:53,684
All right, I made you spicy Cheetos

177
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:02,501
So ... how is it?

178
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:05,749
It went smoothly

179
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:13,979
Do you have anyone besides me?

180
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,803
Well, when people find out, their temperament becomes weird

181
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,187
... they just

182
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,212
different

183
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,477
...

184
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,117
This fourth degree cancer genius

185
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:27,477
I mean, how many degrees?

186
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,831
Four toasts - all we know -

187
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:38,809
Oh, you have to be somewhere else now that is more important than chemotherapy?

188
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,119
Not

189
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:49,475
You try to go back to the lab

190
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,396
I have a series of ideas

191
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,316
Not that good. Your time is up

192
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:03,276
So you don’t understand what the world is trying to tell you

193
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:04,672
I will translate it for you

194
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,432
just relax

195
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:13,029
I'll fight my way, okay?

196
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:18,579
Well, for the record, I say my method is not the same as being alone in the lab.

197
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:23,492
Maybe it’s time to make your space viking card

198
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:24,772
No cards

199
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,404
why is there? No cards.

200
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:30,035
He was tall, blonde and well built

201
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,352
handsome

202
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:33,271
Jane are you sure? - View -

203
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:35,219
I will solve it like this

204
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:36,402
I myself

205
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:47,111
The result remains the same

206
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:53,784
I'm sorry Jane

207
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,614
If there is anything I can do, call me

208
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:14,823
Viking Legend Push theory

209
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:24,636
millionaire

210
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:26,010
to them

211
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:27,583
Resilience and enthusiasm

212
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,482
And it gives good health

213
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:31,926
Health

214
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,782
Welcome to New Asgard, please drive slowly

215
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:54,206
It smells like a king

216
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,740
Because you deserve it

217
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,800
Eternity Exhibition

218
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:29,286
Look here

219
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:30,920
she is beautiful

220
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,843
We came here to take you home

221
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:38,590
Ya, ke planet Asgard

222
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:41,284
Asgard is not a planet, my children

223
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,972
Asgard is a human, you

224
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,019
And now is the time

225
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:49,100
that I went to the spirit world

226
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:56,447
I will take my place in the great hall of Valhalla

227
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:58,995
A place for the comfort of the gods

228
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,814
Oh, one more thing

229
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:02,844
You have a sister

230
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,283
And now that

231
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:08,156
I will be the star of the gods

232
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:10,595
And I say goodbye

233
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,886
what happen

234
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,643
I'm lost

235
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,737
nahhhh

236
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:25,224
Ayah

237
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:28,323
But wait bro

238
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:32,366
An unknown gate was built behind us

239
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:33,964
Change the look

240
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:44,736
I'm Hela

241
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,411
Goddess of death

242
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:48,639
Now I will return to Asgard

243
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,496
And the throne I really deserve

244
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,678
And nothing stopped me

245
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:56,177
Join me - we will not join you witch -

246
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:57,518
millionaire

247
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,254
impossible

248
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:06,411
I damaged your laptop

249
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,218
It's your turn to die

250
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:09,928
Heimdall - Heimdall -

251
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:23,899
You can almost power

252
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:27,051
Feel this unique and beautiful stone

253
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,682
All right, let's go back to the village

254
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:32,668
Where we can drink real Asgardian beer

255
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:34,003
shake

256
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,379
Thank you

257
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:17,535
We are afraid we will always be at war without the protection of our god

258
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,704
But now there will be peace and quiet

259
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:24,612
Receive this gift in return for your service

260
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:30,452
According to custom, our people donate these animals to the protectors of the planet

261
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:33,951
giant goat

262
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:36,389
Oh look at them. This is amazing

263
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:39,219
Oh look at him, he's moving

264
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:41,776
Thank you very much Shah Yerkan

265
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
listen look

266
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,668
... about the temple - I don't want to talk about the temple -

267
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:46,596
I know what you mean about the temple

268
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:48,726
... it made me angry and - just being a bunch of people jerked off -

269
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:49,751
Okay, I won't talk anymore

270
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,761
Don't forget the goat

271
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,966
what you receive and what you need to bring with you

272
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:59,321
They are beautiful - yes, they are very beautiful -

273
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,004
They also shouted a lot - no problem happened to them -

274
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,807
Find the control of the Kufti so that we can download the request for help

275
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:10,211
Where do you put that control?

276
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:11,473
The child may eat it

277
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:13,459
Don't play around because they have no control

278
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:18,199
...

279
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,841
I will get rid of them now

280
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,955
I want to get rid of it too - Thor doesn't work, they don't charge -

281
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,132
Go away!

282
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,812
How are you, Cor? - Yes, I'm great -

283
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:35,202
...

284
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:41,741
...

285
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:46,764
...

286
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,496
Oh, hey man - Kraglin -

287
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:53,866
are you here all the time? - Yes, you told me to stay on the ship -

288
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,366
This is the Calendar. We got married

289
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:58,221
I'm Groot

290
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:01,090
What do we say about jumping into a relationship?

291
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:02,372
I don't have to do this

292
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:05,102
Yes, you can’t get married on every planet we land on

293
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:06,308
I'm Groot

294
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:08,421
!Finally

295
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,956
All right, let's go, the message asking for help has arrived

296
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:14,244
Please help us, the slaughter of the gods has found us

297
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:15,437
The slaughter of the gods?

298
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,997
Who killed all these gods?

299
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:24,006
...

300
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:26,210
Who can do such a thing?

301
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,895
hey what is this come back

302
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,110
Where are you Thor? - Saif -

303
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,586
We need you here

304
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:39,235
My friend, you are in danger, we must leave immediately

305
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:40,763
Start the ship, friends

306
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:42,620
Maybe we should split up

307
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,113
Many people need help See all these requests for help

308
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:53,306
Do you have a problem with Thor?

309
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:56,442
I admire your commitment to each other, it’s a wonderful thing

310
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:58,250
Something that never happened to me

311
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:00,103
Dude, can I say something?

312
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:01,157
say

313
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,614
I was wrong before

314
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,868
Then I found meaning, I found love

315
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,514
But the feeling of being this nonsense is better than the feeling of being empty

316
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,596
I hope you find something one day

317
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:26,069
It makes you feel stupid

318
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:28,126
I had love before

319
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,284
Not going according to plan

320
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,306
...

321
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,719
...

322
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:42,307
I know this is going to happen, you should go

323
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:43,918
I will look for Saif

324
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,211
You reach the other. The galaxy needs a guardian

325
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:48,426
Fine, let's go

326
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:51,987
...

327
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,935
Take this ship with you as a farewell gift

328
00:25:58,271 --> 00:25:59,485
Will you give me my own ship?

329
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,140
yes for you

330
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:05,795
...

331
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,319
I will light the ship - thank you -

332
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:10,684
God bless old friends

333
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:12,937
Human handshake

334
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:15,231
Asgardian shook hands

335
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:17,128
...with a snake

336
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:19,380
You can't believe it

337
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,858
And we’ll end with a classic Asgardian kick

338
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:28,396
let's go

339
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:29,879
Take care of my people

340
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,029
They are having a hard time

341
00:26:31,063 --> 00:26:32,063
! move one

342
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,731
Remember what I said

343
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:37,351
If you feel lost

344
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:40,743
Just look into the eyes of your loved ones

345
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,658
They tell you who you really are

346
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,281
Goodbye

347
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:57,753
...

348
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,789
to go

349
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,797
Only you and I stay

350
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:07,822
Storm breaker

351
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,598
Be careful with your crazy ax

352
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,534
So what should we do now?

353
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,170
Let's go to Saif

354
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:34,347
Who or what is it?

355
00:27:34,427 --> 00:27:35,811
Faligar

356
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:37,811
Guardians of the Phaligarians

357
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:40,519
We are the best gods you can see

358
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:42,607
Oh no

359
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:53,710
shift. I'm Thor

360
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,549
Odin's Son

361
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:56,990
One of your hands is cut off

362
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:59,083
I will help you - no -

363
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:02,542
Leave me here to die as a hero

364
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,540
Battle on the battlefield

365
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:07,356
That I can take my place in Valhalla

366
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:09,887
Oh, I don't like telling you this, but

367
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:13,681
If you want to go to Valhalla as a warrior, you have to die in battle

368
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:15,860
You survived - no bad luck -

369
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,177
Maybe your hands are in Valhalla

370
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:21,404
What happened to you

371
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:23,357
I'm looking for a crazy person

372
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:24,566
I'm following him here

373
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,909
It’s a trap - who’s that crazy guy? -

374
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,573
The massacre of the gods is coming

375
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:31,906
It aims to destroy the generation of gods

376
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:34,125
Asgard next

377
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,300
...

378
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,644
It's not my fault. I have never seen this table before. Now wherever you go

379
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:34,269
survivors back

380
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,650
Who is this new person?

381
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,525
that person you will like

382
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,000
millionaire

383
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,580
Millionaire ... come here, that's my hammer

384
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:24,467
Millionaire, come here, son

385
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
millionaire

386
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,317
millionaire

387
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,436
!return

388
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,000
millionaire

389
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,900
Excuse me, hello, hammer in your hand

390
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,202
And that's how I look

391
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,800
two

392
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,200
...

393
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,100
two

394
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:39,148
Jane?

395
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:47,827
Let me tell you the story of Thor and Jane

396
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,550
Thor is the god of thunder and Jane is also a knowledgeable woman

397
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,720
And even if they are from different worlds

398
00:32:58,448 --> 00:33:00,798
They match up somehow

399
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,123
441 00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:12,048 Thor teaches Jane how to be a hero

400
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,250
And Jane taught Thor the ways and habits of people

401
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,100
The longer it lasts, the deeper and deeper their love gets

402
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,250
I want you to promise me that you will always protect him

403
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,300
I love you too, man

404
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,350
And deep love becomes magical

405
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,100
But the more he lived with Jane, the more he feared losing her

406
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,100
But even though Jane wasn’t ready to admit it, she was also scared

407
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,100
Because of that, they built a wall between them

408
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,500
Thor is busy saving humanity

409
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,100
Heimdall

410
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,800
Jane began to do the same

411
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,450
She's really busy

412
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,047
And finally, the distance between them grew and grew

413
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:27,766
It became so much so that it could not be stopped

414
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,500
...

415
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,650
...

416
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,450
There are two plates

417
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,990
Jane wrote a note

418
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,100
And Thor read the note

419
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,000
Or so they think

420
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,800
are you okay

421
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,500
Yes, it's just hot here

422
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:21,928
how about

423
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,850
Can we talk later?

424
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,300
Yes of course

425
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,570
I'm glad to see you

426
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,400
What

427
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:20,600
Hey, is this a necrosorde?

428
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Very great. I read a story about it

429
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,450
And you know it will hurt

430
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,350
Oh well, stop it

431
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,650
Hey, don't touch my stuff

432
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:14,525
You better run, coward

433
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,400
Children! They brought children

434
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:39,234
Mom, help me

435
00:37:39,644 --> 00:37:41,964
! Ibu! Ibu -! Ibu -

436
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,500
The shadow giant is bothering me

437
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:16,159
That coward must have run away, I found him

438
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
...

439
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,900
How long? three? four years?

440
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,166
I have not forgotten eight years, seven months and six days

441
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:30,600
The last time I saw you, I didn't actually see you because you were gone.

442
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:37,868
Oh no, you go. You go and write me a beautiful handwritten letter

443
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:43,218
Actually you weren't there and I had to say no - I -

444
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,400
And if you’re not there to see me go, then maybe you should go first

445
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:50,428
This is logical

446
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:57,575
If we both go, then we both go (Again, Ostad Khayabani)

447
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,626
And now you leave me again

448
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:06,100
Drill, give me the names of all the missing children

449
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,100
My lord, the girl has been stolen and I do not know what to do - they will find her -

450
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:13,314
Children, they bleed, take them to the hospital. now

451
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:14,330
drill

452
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,900
People need entertainment

453
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,025
Especially now, in a crisis

454
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,650
in particular

455
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,550
...

456
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:37,256
So he's an ex-girlfriend?

457
00:39:37,778 --> 00:39:39,328
Former old female friend

458
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:41,711
Jodie Foster (American Actress) - Jane Foster -

459
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:43,086
who went

460
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,450
who went

461
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,450
Does that mean he ran away?

462
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,800
Ya ya

463
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,450
I find it hard to see your ex -lover back together with your ex -husband

464
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,300
move one. Come to your father

465
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,500
Hey, you're coming too

466
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:12,946
I just called you to come

467
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:15,300
With what? Half of our army is dead

468
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,550
...

469
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,695
He found them

470
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,100
Asgardians

471
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:46,806
In times like these, we must be united and united

472
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:51,631
Seeing what is happening here, we are scared

473
00:40:52,103 --> 00:40:56,703
We woke up, we were scared and we were worried

474
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,235
If we want to find a child, we have to look inside ourselves first

475
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:07,350
I'm sorry Mick, it's hard for me to speak in a normal voice

476
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,300
what are you doing?

477
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,000
It records everything

478
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,800
We don't have time for this

479
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:12,627
When the children return

480
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:17,559
write this microphone

481
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:34,867
Everyone out

482
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:38,778
I did not find them

483
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:41,095
546
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,818

484
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,039
What do we know about this person?

485
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:46,267
It walks through the shadows

486
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,921
And he made monsters with shadows

487
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,636
Must be a scary monster

488
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:53,220
552 00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:52,314 What is a Necrosword?

489
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:59,691
It has the ability to kill gods

490
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,525
Slowly destroy and kill the person holding it

491
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,137
which means - it infects him -

492
00:42:04,162 --> 00:42:05,732
Yes, he infected her. It is possible

493
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,943
So, basically, we are together

494
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:10,596
We are in front of shadow zombies, enchanted kidnappers

495
00:42:10,621 --> 00:42:12,548
Great. when do we want to go

496
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:15,301
Can Thor see me?

497
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:19,000
He is gone, son of Heimdall

498
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:20,667
Are you okay, Stride?

499
00:42:20,692 --> 00:42:22,644
My name is not Strid anymore

500
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:24,780
Now they know me as Axel

501
00:42:27,302 --> 00:42:28,302
...

502
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:32,226
Your father has given you a great name, and I insist on respecting his choice

503
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:32,838
superior

504
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,098
Stride - I said Excel -

505
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:35,372
Step - Excel -

506
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,893
ok dad where are you axel

507
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:41,162
I'm not sure

508
00:42:43,137 --> 00:42:45,980
Your father told me how it was and I wanted to teach you. You have to focus

509
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:47,342
And raise your hand

510
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:51,581
Now concentrate, close your eyes

511
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:57,941
Thor

512
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:01,775
Hello how are you

513
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,542
How are we? See where we are

514
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,525
In a cage made with a spear

515
00:43:05,723 --> 00:43:07,360
ya benar

516
00:43:07,873 --> 00:43:09,118
are you going to do something

517
00:43:09,143 --> 00:43:10,991
Yes, yes, I will do it, but not now

518
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:13,045
I'm a ghost, look

519
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,730
Do you see

520
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,278
So what's wrong with us?

521
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:17,805
Not stated

522
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,814
Very, very bad situation

523
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:21,376
You know the good news

524
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:24,868
You Asgardian, if you die you go to Valhalla

525
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:25,996
My God, get lost

526
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,062
... stop

527
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:32,159
All right, guys, calm down, okay?

528
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:33,676
See, I have a great plan, okay?

529
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:35,656
I put together a very good group

530
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:38,100
Uncle Korg is in there

531
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,520
Its king is Valkyrie

532
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:41,545
Amm with my ex-girlfriend Jane

533
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,748
who has other stories that won’t bore you

534
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:46,104
Excellent group, but terrible

535
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:48,006
And before you know it, we’ll be following you

536
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:49,031
yes

537
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,399
We will take you from here

538
00:44:02,424 --> 00:44:03,722
I'm afraid

539
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:05,103
We are all scared

540
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:07,342
Help!

541
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:09,282
Thor - Please! Please! help -

542
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:11,374
Thor help us

543
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,660
Hey everyone be careful ok? be careful on the way

544
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:16,078
See you later, okay? Excel, get me out of here

545
00:44:17,327 --> 00:44:18,974
In the land of the shadows

546
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:19,999
How did you know?

547
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,019
No translucent color there, I'm not mistaken

548
00:44:25,044 --> 00:44:27,396
Well, if we need color

549
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:29,265
Let's make a rainbow

550
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:33,285
Should we make a rainbow? Is that a term?

551
00:44:34,915 --> 00:44:37,473
...

552
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:42,989
...

553
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,379
And you see, he moves through the shadows and is in the realm of shadows

554
00:44:48,158 --> 00:44:51,763
That’s right, we can’t go there, it might be a trap, it might be a danger to children.

555
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:53,836
We need help. We need to start an army

556
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,874
Do you think the same thing I did? - Yes, I think the same -

557
00:44:55,899 --> 00:44:57,169
What do you think - What do you think? -

558
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,208
...

559
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,516
The strongest god house in the world

560
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:06,644
We can put together the best team

561
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:08,170
We can agree with the team (Egyptian sun god and creator of everything)

562
00:45:08,195 --> 00:45:09,073
Let's take everyone

563
00:45:09,098 --> 00:45:10,220
Let's bring Tomachuenga(God of War in Maori mythology in New Zealand)

564
00:45:10,245 --> 00:45:11,700
Maybe Quincy Quesaro

565
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:14,275
And Zeus is the oldest god there

566
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:15,476
Did you say Zeus?

567
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:17,966
Yes, Zeus - the same famous Zeus? Zeus Zeus? -

568
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:19,235
I'm not sure if he has a second name

569
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,741
I need to be there too

570
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:24,743
Yes

571
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:26,366
Storm breaker

572
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:28,524
just relax

573
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:31,718
No, no, we're not going anywhere with Bayfrost Dagun Stormbreaker

574
00:45:31,743 --> 00:45:32,743
see what happens

575
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:36,143
We can't go with your little portal in the sky. We can't fit in it

576
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:37,815
what you say? they are great

577
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,008
Stormbreaker is good too

578
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:40,504
Stormbreaker only wants one thing

579
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,173
Anything that can control space travel

580
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,509
He has the power to get us there, he just needs something to focus his power on

581
00:45:46,534 --> 00:45:48,688
It was not so unexpected

582
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:52,131
Well, if we have a ship that can use the Stormbreaker as its power source

583
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,180
Oh, like a motorcycle

584
00:45:53,205 --> 00:45:55,149
Like an engine - we need a ship -

585
00:45:55,572 --> 00:45:56,752
I have a ship

586
00:46:02,414 --> 00:46:04,988
...

587
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:08,363
Leave the important ones alone

588
00:46:08,388 --> 00:46:09,976
He is very important

589
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,672
...

590
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:20,153
oh hey - hey -

591
00:46:20,383 --> 00:46:22,037
I'm hanging out with old friends

592
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:22,957
yes

593
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:29,476
...

594
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:31,866
I'm trying to understand Kim

595
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:33,758
I think I went astray and then I went astray

596
00:46:33,783 --> 00:46:35,560
I see you dressed like me

597
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:36,556
... well, this is how you are

598
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:38,965
It's too much for me

599
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,183
So how do you become friends? how it happened

600
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,848
I swear the millionaire made Saddam

601
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,369
Hmm call you

602
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:49,517
Well, then I came here to investigate

603
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:52,231
The pieces start to glow and emit a sound

604
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:54,419
And then ... I became Thor - a madman -

605
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:58,101
Well, you know what, it suits you

606
00:46:58,126 --> 00:46:59,126
... So

607
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:03,561
I was just trying

608
00:47:07,653 --> 00:47:08,791
See you again

609
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:15,502
what

610
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:17,533
We're just talking

611
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:31,163
Mom, don't leave me

612
00:47:31,703 --> 00:47:33,301
Do not be scared

613
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,409
Even though I have no love

614
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:39,618
You will not be alone

615
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,922
In memory of Eileen Foster

616
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,319
And whatever happens

617
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,237
Never stop fighting

618
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,089
Never stop fighting

619
00:48:04,877 --> 00:48:05,877
two

620
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:07,972
are you okay - Good -

621
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:14,396
Do you think I should come?

622
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:17,975
You are a bully. Of course you have to come

623
00:48:18,247 --> 00:48:19,632
Now, what do you want Josh to do?

624
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:21,125
You are a Viking now

625
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,318
This means you have to die in battle

626
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:27,318
You must die in pain and suffering, otherwise you will not die in Valhalla

627
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:28,481
This is my plan

628
00:48:28,774 --> 00:48:31,283
What about your royal problems?

629
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,061
I love being king

630
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:34,154
I love my people

631
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:37,403
But that's all meetings and so on

632
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:38,697
I miss fighting

633
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:39,914
I miss my sister

634
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:42,163
That's why you have to come

635
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:44,219
All right, we need to go

636
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:45,244
Did you take your stuff?

637
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,206
What did you take your stuff?

638
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:49,575
Yes

639
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,220
hand bomb?

640
00:48:53,245 --> 00:48:55,555
Not a speaker

641
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:02,743
let's go

642
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,467
Is it possible to keep the sink problem between us?

643
00:49:07,762 --> 00:49:08,762
I support you

644
00:49:11,502 --> 00:49:13,216
My Asgardians

645
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:20,522
We will be back with the kids

646
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:23,131
With all the children

647
00:49:23,654 --> 00:49:24,654
Maybe it's better to celebrate

648
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:26,892
Of course, not without children

649
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:28,759
You don't do that again

650
00:49:30,728 --> 00:49:32,389
...

651
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,266
All right, we better go

652
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,850
no, how about you?

653
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,100
Yes, every weekend

654
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:31,550
...

655
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,550
I was thinking of giving it to this person when we arrived

656
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,050
What if I have a bad term?

657
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,500
For example, take this hammer

658
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,450
...

659
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,634
No, it's very good for me

660
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:50,425
The story ends here and now

661
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,550
...

662
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,100
Give me this person first

663
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,550
You never forget the first one

664
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,400
yes

665
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,850
So you have a boyfriend?

666
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,400
Oh, no, I'm too busy, I don't have time

667
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,171
My head is hot and so on

668
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:12,450
Too bad, let me check here

669
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,000
very great

670
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:18,992
Who is so stupid? - Han? -

671
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,800
Our building is ugly

672
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,537
what happen

673
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:25,300
Do I feel anything?

674
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:28,914
feel? to Jane? No, we don't think about it anymore

675
00:51:28,957 --> 00:51:31,075
We had the feeling last time

676
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,700
It's been a long time. I think you have feelings

677
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,800
Calm down friends, we're a team

678
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:40,197
I don't know exactly which team we're on, do I?

679
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,600
tim Jane

680
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:48,307
Think of Thor who is always looking for a way

681
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,404
When Hela breaks her iron hammer

682
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:53,860
He went and made an ax for himself with a dying star

683
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,983
And with the same arrow he cut off the head of Thanos (First of all)

684
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,450
What an interesting story

685
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,100
...

686
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,556
Is this? oh

687
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,700
...

688
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,100
what? You liked the beheading just a moment ago

689
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,900
...

690
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,400
I know a little girl like you

691
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,800
And he is brave and wise

692
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,750
Let me ask you a question

693
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,300
About god

694
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,000
They're supposed to protect you, aren't they?

695
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:15,912
So where are you now?

696
00:53:15,937 --> 00:53:17,137
Thor is on his way

697
00:53:17,162 --> 00:53:18,200
!Ya ya-

698
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,700
yes. I look forward to his arrival

699
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,600
That's why you're here

700
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:30,250
We were not invited here, so we had to hide

701
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,775
And we have to wear disguise so they don’t recognize us

702
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,200
I am a philosopher now

703
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,100
are they chinese

704
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,700
Real disguise

705
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,662
Clothes for their emotional gods

706
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:45,800
And each color shows emotion

707
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,700
Where are the emotional gods?

708
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,576
Do not ask

709
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,400
Oh shit

710
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,000
...

711
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:16,403
...

712
00:54:16,427 --> 00:54:17,822
Oh look at that

713
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:21,838
...

714
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:25,452
Hey guys, look up, that's god Kronan

715
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,300
!Zeus! Zeus

716
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:42,573
!Zeus! Zeus

717
00:54:42,663 --> 00:54:44,075
!Zeus! Zeus

718
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:45,195
!Zeus! Zeus

719
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:46,535
!Zeus! Zeus

720
00:54:46,687 --> 00:54:48,424
!Zeus! Zeus! Zeus

721
00:54:48,637 --> 00:54:51,795
!Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus

722
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:54,044
!Zeus! Zeus

723
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:43,719
Yes

724
00:55:44,627 --> 00:55:45,897
I am Zeus

725
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:51,888
oh they

726
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,098
The same people, myths, legends

727
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:57,300
I don’t know if you noticed or not, me and this person are very similar

728
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:59,675
He is the god of thunder

729
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:04,630
Peachy. You should tell him the same thing when you go to ask the soldier

730
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:06,484
I will not go up there

731
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,804
...

732
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:14,738
Oh!

733
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:18,257
!Zeus

734
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,766
!calm! calm

735
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:44,778
! Silence

736
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,427
This sacred assembly

737
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:54,861
from god

738
00:56:55,254 --> 00:56:58,485
But we have a very, very basic problem

739
00:56:58,510 --> 00:56:59,849
to talk about them

740
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,340
... like that

741
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:06,701
Isn't that nonsense?

742
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:10,074
... I must have some important business

743
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:12,283
... now we want this week's winner - sorry -

744
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:15,474
The most humane victim

745
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:18,043
Let's introduce the names of God

746
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,408
Okay, maybe not so great

747
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:20,885
Oh no, not good

748
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,900
No, I don’t think it could be any better than this

749
00:57:22,924 --> 00:57:24,470
These gods may not be able to help

750
00:57:24,495 --> 00:57:26,929
But I think the thunder will start our work

751
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:29,332
Jane you to the right, Thor you to the left

752
00:57:29,357 --> 00:57:31,615
We will go and take the yellow thunder out of it

753
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:32,765
All right, let's go

754
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,004
No, no, no, let me see

755
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:37,549
No news turned yellow, Zeus beat us

756
00:57:37,574 --> 00:57:39,203
I will talk to him when the time comes

757
00:57:39,228 --> 00:57:41,333
Well, the time is now - the time is not now -

758
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:42,464
who is speaking

759
00:57:42,733 --> 00:57:43,868
who is speaking

760
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:44,930
this

761
00:57:44,955 --> 00:57:47,971
Korg shut up - do you have anything to tell us? -

762
00:57:48,254 --> 00:57:49,254
I am sorry

763
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:54,167
...

764
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:55,623
Who are you two?

765
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,556
Halo

766
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:02,167
I can't hear your voice

767
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:03,770
Why don’t you come and speak from the pulpit?

768
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:05,740
platforms under the sun?

769
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:10,259
Yes, you can see this area, which is very similar to the lecture platform

770
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,567
I understand

771
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:20,676
oh how are you

772
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,219
Oh, sorry

773
00:58:23,244 --> 00:58:24,244
good luck das

774
00:58:32,163 --> 00:58:34,293
the mighty zeus

775
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:37,570
god of the world

776
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,701
I came here to ask for your help

777
00:58:39,765 --> 00:58:40,954
to make an army

778
00:58:41,259 --> 00:58:44,429
There is a psychic who is called a god killer and wants to kill us all

779
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:48,292
It has access to anywhere, all planets, nature

780
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:52,313
We are powerless against it and no one can stop it

781
00:58:52,338 --> 00:58:54,032
And I know where he is

782
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:56,729
With your help, we can eat it

783
00:58:56,754 --> 00:58:58,658
Before he killed anyone else

784
00:58:58,683 --> 00:59:00,164
what you said

785
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:03,379
Kill some low -ranking gods

786
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,940
proceed? That's all

787
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:09,543
Pretty boy, sit down and don't talk anymore

788
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:12,493
Sorry, didn't you hear anything I said?

789
00:59:12,613 --> 00:59:14,455
He also committed genocide

790
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:18,929
After I say something, then you should shut up

791
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:21,979
Because you are so far away to be invited to the event

792
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:24,185
Zeus, we have to do something

793
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,330
You can't come to the party

794
00:59:26,427 --> 00:59:27,784
You should listen to us

795
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:30,773
Diam!

796
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:35,296
Well, I am ready to follow your plan. Let's just say - at my signal, we go -

797
00:59:35,477 --> 00:59:37,577
What's the signal? - I said let's go -

798
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:45,068
Let’s see who you are and get rid of your disguise

799
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:47,731
and the sudden wind

800
00:59:54,445 --> 00:59:56,545
Damn you blew too much

801
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,968
Shouldn't we help him now?

802
01:00:00,855 --> 01:00:03,255
Finally we will help him. growing grapes

803
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:08,563
what about the others? Take off your disguise too

804
01:00:08,659 --> 01:00:10,650
Oh no, I'll take it off myself

805
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:12,666
Let's take it

806
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:13,941
I took off my disguise, okay?

807
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:18,365
Asgardians, I think we last saw you when Odin died

808
01:00:19,308 --> 01:00:23,508
And you are Thor, god of thunder

809
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,932
But you can’t make thunder sound on your own

810
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:33,032
Zeus, this situation is more than we can handle

811
01:00:33,057 --> 01:00:35,008
He brought the children of Asgard

812
01:00:35,157 --> 01:00:38,457
Who do you think we are? God's police

813
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,135
Every god takes care of his people

814
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,860
No more and no less

815
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:50,247
Asgardian things are their own

816
01:00:50,706 --> 01:00:56,406
See how my hero Zeus is scared

817
01:01:08,509 --> 01:01:13,309
Let me tell you a few things, first of all, yes, I’m scared

818
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:18,297
Gore has a necrosword, which means it can kill us

819
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,245
which is not good and the second

820
01:01:20,311 --> 01:01:23,711
I know you want to do the right thing, I understand

821
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:27,883
But the only thing you do is create fear and that’s not good at all

822
01:01:28,529 --> 01:01:32,799
We are safe here and so are you

823
01:01:33,132 --> 01:01:34,632
So calm down

824
01:01:35,054 --> 01:01:37,654
Drink some wine, put some wine on your body

825
01:01:42,372 --> 01:01:44,972
And third, don't talk about Zeus

826
01:01:45,323 --> 01:01:47,923
Now put on your clothes

827
01:01:48,865 --> 01:01:53,865
And now I will return your clothes

828
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,913
If you don’t want to help us, at least let us use your weapons

829
01:02:00,346 --> 01:02:01,599
I need thunder

830
01:02:04,745 --> 01:02:07,774
So I think when you want to take someone’s secret weapon

831
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:10,845
At least you should ask for it properly

832
01:02:11,299 --> 01:02:12,999
Can I borrow thunder?

833
01:02:13,213 --> 01:02:15,013
group

834
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,341
Not

835
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:52,917
Don’t worry, the slaughter of the gods will not achieve immortality

836
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:54,450
Eternity?

837
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:56,311
What does it mean not to attain Immortality?

838
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:01,617
Oh shit

839
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:08,696
Immortality is a very powerful being at the center of the universe

840
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:11,951
He will grant his wish to whoever attains it first

841
01:03:16,428 --> 01:03:19,144
In your opinion, what can a person named Wrong God expect?

842
01:03:19,315 --> 01:03:22,515
If it reaches Eternity, it can destroy us all in the blink of an eye

843
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:25,808
Zeus, we have to do something now - he can't do anything -

844
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:27,384
He has no keys

845
01:03:28,076 --> 01:03:32,676
Is this the goal of the gods? To remain like a coward in a golden castle

846
01:03:32,803 --> 01:03:34,393
Maybe we really got lost

847
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:37,083
do you know? We will take care of it ourselves

848
01:03:37,207 --> 01:03:39,207
Unfortunately, I can't let this happen

849
01:03:39,864 --> 01:03:42,264
This is a secret place

850
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:45,967
Same thing for god, now you know where we are

851
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,981
Slaughter God can use you and find us

852
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:51,958
And this is not good at all

853
01:03:52,919 --> 01:03:56,819
And now you have to stay here

854
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:00,871
Guardian

855
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:03,977
So can we go with my plan now?

856
01:04:04,124 --> 01:04:07,024
Yes, Zarti jumped in the middle

857
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,420
Hey, you didn't bring me

858
01:04:27,899 --> 01:04:29,699
Take Thor

859
01:04:31,647 --> 01:04:32,715
coorg

860
01:04:52,185 --> 01:04:54,385
Valk, lower your head

861
01:04:58,832 --> 01:05:00,632
Korg

862
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:03,511
Taurus

863
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:06,877
No, not Korg

864
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,225
Taurus

865
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,670
I'm getting crushed

866
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:16,639
Zeus

867
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,340
I don’t want this to happen to my son

868
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:30,608
This is the sound of thunder

869
01:05:40,398 --> 01:05:42,098
...

870
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:44,996
Thor, I'm here

871
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:46,421
where are you?

872
01:05:46,683 --> 01:05:51,073
I am here. I'm not dead - Coorg. you live -

873
01:05:51,352 --> 01:05:54,352
Apparently, the living part was just the crown of his mouth

874
01:05:54,582 --> 01:05:57,882
Look korg should call that goat - I'm trying -

875
01:06:05,704 --> 01:06:07,104
...

876
01:06:12,155 --> 01:06:15,655
...

877
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:34,335
! I'm done doing it

878
01:07:11,642 --> 01:07:15,842
Then the goat came and came through the window to save you and me

879
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:18,102
And all the classic Thor adventures

880
01:07:18,815 --> 01:07:20,315
I can't believe you killed Zeus

881
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:23,651
Yes, someone once said that you can’t meet your hero

882
01:07:25,257 --> 01:07:27,757
What matters is that we are on our way to come to you

883
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,720
How are you here, are you okay?

884
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,345
That's good, we're just scared

885
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:33,625
Look, I know how scared it is

886
01:07:33,785 --> 01:07:37,533
I think I wasn’t that brave when I was your age

887
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:38,334
Really?

888
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:42,190
In fact, I think you are the bravest Asgardian I have ever seen, all of you

889
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:47,031
Stay brave and take care of each other, you are a team now

890
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:49,349
Children's team at home

891
01:07:50,406 --> 01:07:53,906
Can you do this - Yes. I think we can do this -

892
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:56,918
I know you can

893
01:07:59,023 --> 01:08:00,023
good

894
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:01,892
Thor - John? -

895
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:04,943
Good to meet my hero - oh thank you friend -

896
01:08:09,531 --> 01:08:10,831
how are the children

897
01:08:10,857 --> 01:08:14,957
As I thought, they were scared because they were young, but I told them things would be fine

898
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:15,999
So you lied to them

899
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:17,110
Do you still have a plan?

900
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,161
yes - no, no plans -

901
01:08:18,186 --> 01:08:20,386
We have a plan - No, we don't have a plan -

902
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:22,442
We can't make a team of gods

903
01:08:22,638 --> 01:08:23,638
Coorg is dead

904
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:25,000
No, not dead - I'm not dead -

905
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:26,576
Well, all that's left is you

906
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:28,183
You were also ridiculed in detail

907
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:30,781
No, I have an empty joint, which I have no problem with

908
01:08:30,854 --> 01:08:32,454
Jane? - I have no problem -

909
01:08:32,515 --> 01:08:33,691
Coorg? - I laughed by the way -

910
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:39,914
are we dead serious? - No one is going to die, right? -

911
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:42,647
Everything is good, our work is very good

912
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:44,711
We killed Zeus on his ship

913
01:08:44,815 --> 01:08:47,615
Well, now it may be a disaster for the whole world and beyond

914
01:08:47,659 --> 01:08:51,037
And all their gods will follow us in the next few days

915
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:54,641
But look, you stole this beautiful weapon, didn't you?

916
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,085
This is the army we want

917
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:59,310
... it’s smooth and polished and strong and beautiful

918
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:03,041
Good for you, I like good for you, Valkyrie

919
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:06,891
But, I have my own weapons, but I don’t use them very often

920
01:09:11,622 --> 01:09:13,622
Oh, that's right, old friend

921
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,475
You put a very interesting story in there

922
01:09:22,501 --> 01:09:25,101
Listen, don't we have a problem now?

923
01:09:25,563 --> 01:09:28,763
You know, weird old gun I have

924
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:30,248
But don't worry

925
01:09:30,273 --> 01:09:33,573
The past is the past, now you and I are together

926
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,840
You know, come and drink your first beer

927
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:37,937
What do you think

928
01:09:43,306 --> 01:09:44,506
It's delicious

929
01:09:45,336 --> 01:09:47,636
Sorry for being busy lately

930
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:56,627
two

931
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:58,352
oh hey

932
01:10:00,064 --> 01:10:03,964
It has a beautiful view, doesn't it? - Yes beauty -

933
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:07,090
That's so cool what you do

934
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,146
With Mjolnir, you know

935
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:13,302
... hanya, ya

936
01:10:16,334 --> 01:10:18,134
Space dolphins

937
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,776
You have to look at them, space dolphins

938
01:10:23,893 --> 01:10:25,593
Wow beautiful

939
01:10:26,296 --> 01:10:29,096
Both beautiful creatures and rare creatures are very loyal

940
01:10:51,608 --> 01:10:55,508
...

941
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,690
...

942
01:11:08,246 --> 01:11:10,146
Oh, how beautiful and attractive she is

943
01:11:12,175 --> 01:11:15,275
...

944
01:11:15,947 --> 01:11:19,147
I don't know ... I don't know if I want more or not

945
01:11:22,368 --> 01:11:25,309
...

946
01:11:28,137 --> 01:11:30,737
...

947
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:33,742
Yes, something like that

948
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:38,625
Beautiful, very beautiful

949
01:11:43,102 --> 01:11:45,502
Jane - Thor -

950
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:47,439
I want to feel bad for you - what? -

951
01:11:49,901 --> 01:11:53,805
Umm ... I ... I want to feel stupid about something

952
01:11:54,581 --> 01:11:55,781
And I think that's you

953
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,379
I don't want to hear it anymore - it's not what it looks like -

954
01:11:58,717 --> 01:12:02,403
... a friend of mine who told me about having a sense of nonsense

955
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,676
He said for fear of losing love, one never experiences love and ends up with emptiness

956
01:12:07,701 --> 01:12:08,986
And I think he's right

957
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:13,699
And this is what I feel today and I push people

958
01:12:13,778 --> 01:12:15,978
And I kept them away for fear of losing them

959
01:12:16,056 --> 01:12:17,656
But I don't want to do this anymore

960
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:19,613
You close your heart and

961
01:12:20,152 --> 01:12:24,452
Yes, yes, I close my heart and meditate, what are you contemplating?

962
01:12:24,477 --> 01:12:25,905
No, it's very boring

963
01:12:25,961 --> 01:12:28,661
It really makes me even angrier

964
01:12:28,732 --> 01:12:31,032
I'm tired of surrendering to destiny

965
01:12:31,082 --> 01:12:33,282
And understand who the world wants from me

966
01:12:33,302 --> 01:12:37,802
I want to live in the present as if there is no tomorrow

967
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,230
I want to be with you, Jane

968
01:12:40,682 --> 01:12:43,782
What do you say, Jane - I have cancer -

969
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:49,029
I'm sorry, what - I'm dying -

970
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,560
Hey what happened

971
01:12:51,182 --> 01:12:55,682
No, no, no, Jin, Jin, Jin, look, I don't mean that -

972
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:59,689
I was joking that I didn’t have cancer

973
01:13:01,618 --> 01:13:03,207
I'm sorry Jane

974
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:05,565
Don't feel sorry for me

975
01:13:06,794 --> 01:13:08,594
when you will understand

976
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:12,142
About six months ago

977
01:13:12,273 --> 01:13:14,466
I just felt tired and then

978
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:16,482
I found out that I have stage 4 cancer

979
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:18,050
I put myself together

980
01:13:18,888 --> 01:13:21,388
And then I heard that Mjolnir called Saddam

981
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:27,471
...

982
01:13:28,717 --> 01:13:31,817
That's why you came to New Asgard - yes, because of the iron hammer -

983
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:36,819
...

984
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:41,479
Jane, none of us know how much time we have

985
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:44,122
I don't know what will happen tomorrow

986
01:13:44,514 --> 01:13:47,914
And millionaires ... millionaires choose you

987
01:13:47,922 --> 01:13:51,022
And he chose you because you deserve it, nothing else

988
01:13:51,459 --> 01:13:55,759
The first time I saw you, I didn't qualify, I couldn't lift the hammer

989
01:13:56,774 --> 01:14:00,874
But you tell me that there is no greater purpose than helping people in need

990
01:14:01,597 --> 01:14:03,997
You deserve me

991
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:08,106
Whatever you want to do, we can do together

992
01:14:09,314 --> 01:14:10,131
good

993
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:11,806
And what do you want to do?

994
01:14:13,577 --> 01:14:16,177
I want to return the children to their families

995
01:14:16,215 --> 01:14:18,515
And complete the mission

996
01:14:22,185 --> 01:14:23,985
how do you feel now

997
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:25,932
I am really afraid

998
01:14:26,971 --> 01:14:29,171
how do you feel - bull sheet -

999
01:14:29,663 --> 01:14:31,763
how crazy - so stupid -

1000
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:33,391
good

1001
01:14:43,384 --> 01:14:45,584
I don't know what they're talking about

1002
01:14:45,918 --> 01:14:47,418
They don't talk

1003
01:14:47,494 --> 01:14:49,794
Oooh

1004
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:54,160
Do you think they both believe the story I told you about making babies?

1005
01:14:56,129 --> 01:14:58,229
Unfortunately, they don’t seem to be doing this

1006
01:14:58,922 --> 01:15:01,822
it gets bad. I thought Thor would be a good father

1007
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,599
Hey, we're here

1008
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,848
Discoloration

1009
01:15:50,162 --> 01:15:51,862
They are not here

1010
01:15:56,876 --> 01:15:58,876
where

1011
01:16:17,444 --> 01:16:19,944
What else is going on here?

1012
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,491
Bifrost is the key

1013
01:16:58,551 --> 01:17:01,051
This is a trap

1014
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:19,616
Can you tell me why you threw Stormbreaker out the window?

1015
01:17:19,724 --> 01:17:21,724
With that, he can attain immortality

1016
01:17:53,324 --> 01:17:54,924
You really should stop doing this

1017
01:17:55,022 --> 01:17:56,122
Call your ax

1018
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:57,773
When you go to the dentist, I will call you

1019
01:17:57,789 --> 01:18:02,889
Call the ax -... tell me where the kids are and then I'll kill -

1020
01:18:09,689 --> 01:18:11,689
Call your ax

1021
01:18:18,147 --> 01:18:20,147
Wow, you are god

1022
01:18:20,828 --> 01:18:24,595
You know nothing about being God

1023
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:31,319
You go to the gods to get help from them and they do nothing

1024
01:18:31,555 --> 01:18:34,355
Like me

1025
01:18:34,802 --> 01:18:36,602
It's not like you at all

1026
01:18:36,664 --> 01:18:38,664
What did you say

1027
01:18:41,071 --> 01:18:43,271
I said he's not like you at all

1028
01:18:46,383 --> 01:18:49,497
I truly create peace and quiet

1029
01:18:49,662 --> 01:18:52,262
You killed an innocent god - innocent? -

1030
01:18:53,246 --> 01:18:55,146
are you a valkyrie - Yes -

1031
01:18:56,558 --> 01:18:58,758
!very interesting

1032
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:02,089
God, they did the same to you

1033
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:06,263
Your sister's association went to the slaughterhouse

1034
01:19:08,318 --> 01:19:10,418
Do you pray to the gods for them?

1035
01:19:10,471 --> 01:19:14,901
When did the woman you love die on the battlefield?

1036
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:18,784
Did you ask for their help?

1037
01:19:24,206 --> 01:19:26,506
...

1038
01:19:33,557 --> 01:19:35,077
...

1039
01:19:35,757 --> 01:19:36,880
yes

1040
01:19:45,466 --> 01:19:46,997
You are dying

1041
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,409
I am sorry

1042
01:19:50,449 --> 01:19:52,727
We are same

1043
01:19:54,712 --> 01:19:58,212
The sword gives me strength

1044
01:19:58,887 --> 01:20:01,414
an iron hammer also gives you strength

1045
01:20:02,003 --> 01:20:04,903
But he did nothing to change your destiny

1046
01:20:05,783 --> 01:20:09,208
The gods are using you

1047
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:12,416
But they don't help you

1048
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:18,270
There is no permanent reward for us

1049
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,537
He will die soon

1050
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:31,449
And you know who can help him, I'll let you guess

1051
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:46,541
I know what your pain is, that love hurts

1052
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,549
I once had a daughter

1053
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:58,367
I believe in a higher power that hopes to save him

1054
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,541
... and it

1055
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:02,859
Man

1056
01:21:07,857 --> 01:21:11,877
And now I understand that my daughter is lucky

1057
01:21:12,977 --> 01:21:16,277
He doesn't have to grow up in the world

1058
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:19,730
full of pain

1059
01:21:20,054 --> 01:21:24,754
Full of running and evil gods

1060
01:21:25,809 --> 01:21:28,909
choose love

1061
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,800
Call your ax

1062
01:21:41,411 --> 01:21:46,111
Call your ax

1063
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:24,368
are you okay - Yes -

1064
01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:30,700
I want to kill this person - I want to, but we have to bring him alive

1065
01:22:30,896 --> 01:22:32,896
Just until we found the kids

1066
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:48,220
Oh, thank you Mr. Goat

1067
01:24:21,434 --> 01:24:22,554
Wah!

1068
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:35,490
We have to get him out of here

1069
01:24:45,074 --> 01:24:46,253
Hey I love you

1070
01:24:57,063 --> 01:24:58,863
You're all here, let's go and shake

1071
01:24:58,904 --> 01:25:01,037
Bring home our storm breaker

1072
01:25:59,054 --> 01:26:02,354
See how many other treatments we can try

1073
01:26:02,422 --> 01:26:05,422
But something destroyed his body’s ability to fight cancer

1074
01:26:06,347 --> 01:26:07,347
Forgive me Thor

1075
01:26:22,227 --> 01:26:23,981
wow you are here

1076
01:26:24,038 --> 01:26:25,037
What's going on out there?

1077
01:26:25,088 --> 01:26:28,152
Can you believe that a child broke the refrigerator?

1078
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:34,025
how val - Oh, it hurts so much -

1079
01:26:34,266 --> 01:26:36,066
But things are stable - very good -

1080
01:26:36,486 --> 01:26:39,866
... you know, I just have to do one test and then - oh no no -

1081
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:44,104
It must remain in you so that all the magical ingredients and elixirs enter your body

1082
01:26:44,619 --> 01:26:46,619
I'm going out to look for the kids

1083
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:48,930
I will kill the bad guys and then I will come back

1084
01:26:49,606 --> 01:26:51,106
did you go without me?

1085
01:26:52,209 --> 01:26:55,109
What happened until you said we were going to do everything together?

1086
01:26:55,433 --> 01:26:58,233
He uses children to distract you. you need me

1087
01:26:58,252 --> 01:27:00,752
It's clear that I need you, I want you alive

1088
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:04,024
It's great that you're by my side on the battlefield and fighting by my side

1089
01:27:04,073 --> 01:27:06,373
And the hammer killed you

1090
01:27:07,291 --> 01:27:12,491
Every time you use it, it eliminates your death and prevents your body from fighting cancer

1091
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:15,436
So what happens when you say life is like no tomorrow?

1092
01:27:15,806 --> 01:27:17,762
That’s for a time I didn’t know that you might not have a tomorrow

1093
01:27:19,149 --> 01:27:21,253
Jane, if there is a chance to survive, you must take it

1094
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:24,269
It works for someone who does not have cancer

1095
01:27:27,848 --> 01:27:30,931
I know, like a space scientist from New Mexico

1096
01:27:30,956 --> 01:27:33,163
He wants to live his dream

1097
01:27:33,188 --> 01:27:34,748
But look at me

1098
01:27:34,773 --> 01:27:36,715
I want to keep fighting

1099
01:27:36,739 --> 01:27:38,139
I am the mighty Thor

1100
01:27:38,403 --> 01:27:42,103
And you want me not to do that, so what's the point of doing this again?

1101
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:44,742
I mean I love you

1102
01:27:47,477 --> 01:27:49,177
I always love you

1103
01:27:50,338 --> 01:27:52,706
And this is an opportunity for us

1104
01:27:53,087 --> 01:27:56,423
And if you take the sledgehammer, the chance will be lost

1105
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:16,129
But every day I regret why I didn’t tell you to stay so we could sort it out together

1106
01:28:19,853 --> 01:28:21,853
You better come back to me

1107
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,430
I will be back as soon as possible

1108
01:28:27,688 --> 01:28:28,933
...

1109
01:28:42,659 --> 01:28:45,207
Remember that the door to Eternity is in the middle

1110
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:46,215
This is the world, I know - this is the world -

1111
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:49,715
Yes, yes, how many times have you said that? I won't get lost

1112
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,679
So how do you do with that scar?

1113
01:28:52,704 --> 01:28:53,952
I think I lost my kidneys

1114
01:28:53,977 --> 01:28:55,443
Yes, it is completely broken

1115
01:28:55,468 --> 01:28:57,315
I wish I could follow you, but

1116
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,316
I will probably die on the way to bring the kids back

1117
01:28:59,341 --> 01:29:01,213
So you have to go alone

1118
01:29:01,507 --> 01:29:04,211
All you have to do is destroy the sword

1119
01:29:04,236 --> 01:29:07,139
It is a source of strength, without which it cannot survive

1120
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:09,927
two

1121
01:29:09,951 --> 01:29:11,127
not dead

1122
01:29:11,152 --> 01:29:12,177
Yes I know

1123
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,988
Eternity

1124
01:30:10,052 --> 01:30:11,411
!Finally

1125
01:30:43,262 --> 01:30:44,929
(This is a Celestial statue)

1126
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:54,880
Hi friend

1127
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,892
I knew you were coming

1128
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,925
Go, go friend

1129
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:11,756
are they all ok

1130
01:31:11,781 --> 01:31:13,209
So collect, collect

1131
01:31:13,756 --> 01:31:15,907
I'm glad to see you in person

1132
01:31:27,368 --> 01:31:29,050
Well, listen, here's the plan

1133
01:31:29,122 --> 01:31:31,116
You sneaked into Stormbreaker

1134
01:31:31,204 --> 01:31:35,200
Be careful not to come across the shadow monster

1135
01:31:43,503 --> 01:31:45,773
Does anyone here have any fighting experience?

1136
01:31:46,506 --> 01:31:48,520
You won't be able to study like now

1137
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,001
We are not as strong as you

1138
01:31:50,026 --> 01:31:53,359
We're kids - hey, remember, you're Asgardian -

1139
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,256
...

1140
01:31:57,281 --> 01:31:59,560
Okay, okay, but at least today.

1141
01:31:59,585 --> 01:32:00,592
We are Asgardians

1142
01:32:00,908 --> 01:32:02,165
Take your weapon

1143
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,292
which weapon

1144
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:05,154
Go pick up whatever you find

1145
01:32:05,179 --> 01:32:06,138
Come back quickly

1146
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,189
Fast!

1147
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:10,094
move fast

1148
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:13,097
They're getting closer, hurry up

1149
01:32:15,609 --> 01:32:16,603
Today

1150
01:32:16,858 --> 01:32:18,865
The day our names will be recorded in history

1151
01:32:20,043 --> 01:32:23,124
This is a day that will be determined for generations to come

1152
01:32:23,658 --> 01:32:26,032
This is the day when we walk in space

1153
01:32:26,604 --> 01:32:28,565
Prepare your weapons!

1154
01:32:38,195 --> 01:32:40,864
...

1155
01:32:44,356 --> 01:32:47,704
God's power

1156
01:32:57,011 --> 01:32:58,265
Excel Umum

1157
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,999
Bring the army to the side of the ax

1158
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,042
For Asgard

1159
01:35:06,759 --> 01:35:07,759
Not

1160
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:22,958
Jane

1161
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,225
Let's destroy the sword, I will die alone

1162
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,418
The gate is almost open, you have to stop Starbreaker

1163
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,294
no problem. i have it

1164
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:55,874
Storm breakers solve it

1165
01:35:56,448 --> 01:35:58,392
Take me back

1166
01:35:58,408 --> 01:36:00,011
I'll take you from there

1167
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,700
move one

1168
01:36:01,771 --> 01:36:03,719
Run away!

1169
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:11,937
Ax ... I ... let go ... go

1170
01:36:15,922 --> 01:36:17,556
You lost Mrs. Thoreh

1171
01:36:24,717 --> 01:36:25,906
First

1172
01:36:26,098 --> 01:36:27,177
my name

1173
01:36:27,202 --> 01:36:28,525
Thor is strong

1174
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:31,658
Second

1175
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,876
If you can't say Thor is strong

1176
01:36:34,845 --> 01:36:38,728
said Dr. Jane Foster, I agree

1177
01:36:42,585 --> 01:36:43,878
Third

1178
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,819
Eat my hammer!

1179
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,737
Storm breaker

1180
01:37:02,165 --> 01:37:03,387
I know you can do it

1181
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:05,474
superior

1182
01:37:05,657 --> 01:37:06,530
take them home

1183
01:38:55,406 --> 01:38:56,406
Jane

1184
01:38:56,899 --> 01:38:57,899
I'm good

1185
01:38:58,852 --> 01:39:00,162
I only need a minute to catch my breath

1186
01:39:29,973 --> 01:39:30,973
Gore, hold your hand

1187
01:39:35,993 --> 01:39:37,857
What kind of father will I be?

1188
01:39:38,885 --> 01:39:39,987
If I hold hands?

1189
01:39:44,472 --> 01:39:46,622
I understand your pain but this is not the way

1190
01:39:49,235 --> 01:39:52,326
You are not looking for death or revenge

1191
01:39:55,093 --> 01:39:56,243
What am I looking for?

1192
01:40:10,903 --> 01:40:12,077
You are looking for love

1193
01:40:15,304 --> 01:40:16,226
Love

1194
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:20,141
Why do I need to find love?

1195
01:40:20,466 --> 01:40:22,294
Because that's what we all want

1196
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,925
oh

1197
01:40:26,124 --> 01:40:27,298
Ayah

1198
01:40:27,789 --> 01:40:29,849
You turned your back on me

1199
01:40:31,312 --> 01:40:32,502
You win, Gore

1200
01:40:33,298 --> 01:40:36,236
Why spend my last moments with you when I can be with him?

1201
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:39,464
I choose love

1202
01:40:39,662 --> 01:40:41,915
You can also choose, you can cut

1203
01:40:46,554 --> 01:40:47,814
do your wish

1204
01:41:19,412 --> 01:41:20,714
Finish me

1205
01:41:22,406 --> 01:41:23,612
He won't have anyone

1206
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:26,551
He lives alone

1207
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:35,578
He is not alone

1208
01:42:46,669 --> 01:42:47,763
my darling

1209
01:43:02,732 --> 01:43:04,003
...

1210
01:43:12,308 --> 01:43:14,886
Since I took the hammer

1211
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:21,005
I got an extra joon

1212
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:26,448
and magic

1213
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,589
This is so bad for you

1214
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,661
That's not too bad for God

1215
01:43:37,148 --> 01:43:39,603
I think I understand my terminology

1216
01:43:47,683 --> 01:43:48,342
incomplete

1217
01:43:49,108 --> 01:43:51,299
This is the best term you can say - thank you -

1218
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:01,874
Always open your heart

1219
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:08,882
I love you

1220
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:11,732
I love you too

1221
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:58,464
Protect him

1222
01:45:00,078 --> 01:45:01,360
protect my love

1223
01:45:35,537 --> 01:45:38,466
Let me tell you about the outer space vikings

1224
01:45:38,628 --> 01:45:39,818
known as

1225
01:45:40,016 --> 01:45:41,445
strong taurus

1226
01:45:42,028 --> 01:45:45,370
Held Dr. Jane Foster

1227
01:45:47,588 --> 01:45:50,034
His sacrifice saved the world

1228
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:56,415
He helps the children of gods

1229
01:45:56,593 --> 01:45:58,790
He paved the way for them to return home

1230
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:02,995
to their small fishing villages which became tourist destinations

1231
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,523
How are you?

1232
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:09,547
Are you sure? - Yes, I'm fine -

1233
01:46:10,057 --> 01:46:12,175
Children are saved to be children again

1234
01:46:15,102 --> 01:46:19,186
Of course, after their king forced them to go to a martial arts class

1235
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:21,051
Look at that little viking

1236
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,443
war cries

1237
01:46:25,423 --> 01:46:27,022
Even the son of Heimdall

1238
01:46:27,054 --> 01:46:28,482
Axel putra Heimdall

1239
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:31,087
Even though he had his father's scary eyes

1240
01:46:31,112 --> 01:46:32,715
He was a good fighter

1241
01:46:33,297 --> 01:46:35,449
Asgard's future is guaranteed

1242
01:46:37,134 --> 01:46:40,318
This is the future, I create my own future

1243
01:46:40,343 --> 01:46:41,845
Now my body is growing back

1244
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:48,184
You ask, what happened to Thor?

1245
01:46:48,932 --> 01:46:50,725
He embarked on a new adventure

1246
01:46:51,149 --> 01:46:53,238
Because he has found something new to live

1247
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:55,184
Something to love

1248
01:46:55,645 --> 01:46:58,677
A pathetic little man from God

1249
01:46:58,702 --> 01:47:00,094
He turns into Lord Baba

1250
01:47:00,278 --> 01:47:02,537
Breakfast is served

1251
01:47:04,078 --> 01:47:06,091
It's from this. Hey, eat your breakfast

1252
01:47:07,065 --> 01:47:10,058
Sorry, what is it?

1253
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:12,083
It's called Pan Flaps. For context

1254
01:47:12,108 --> 01:47:14,052
I guess I don't like the pen cover

1255
01:47:14,077 --> 01:47:15,279
We like - I don't -

1256
01:47:15,304 --> 01:47:16,033
why are you there

1257
01:47:16,058 --> 01:47:19,248
Well, I've never eaten this in my life. - Well, eat more. We need to go, it's over -

1258
01:47:19,273 --> 01:47:20,333
Put on your boots

1259
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:22,215
I'm wearing it

1260
01:47:22,416 --> 01:47:23,820
You don't wear it

1261
01:47:23,916 --> 01:47:25,661
Why do I wear - No, you don't wear -

1262
01:47:25,686 --> 01:47:28,157
Why do I wear - No, you don't wear -

1263
01:47:28,182 --> 01:47:29,588
Go to hell, devil

1264
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,374
Oh God

1265
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:35,354
It's new, thanks for leaving

1266
01:47:35,481 --> 01:47:37,428
do you know? Wear whatever you like

1267
01:47:37,547 --> 01:47:41,074
Don't come to me later, please, I won't show you any mercy

1268
01:47:41,254 --> 01:47:44,609
OK, I won't wear this but - thanks -

1269
01:47:44,634 --> 01:47:46,730
Remember what my mother always told me

1270
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:51,546
...

1271
01:47:53,168 --> 01:47:54,763
I have - I have -

1272
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,855
So where is the millionaire now? Where did you put it?

1273
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,942
He was lying in his bed - on the bed? -

1274
01:48:01,388 --> 01:48:02,490
Oh wow

1275
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,626
It will not be deleted

1276
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:10,436
what did you do - he used to look boring -

1277
01:48:11,807 --> 01:48:13,403
Yes I think so

1278
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:14,245
I like it

1279
01:48:14,753 --> 01:48:15,753
That's very creative

1280
01:48:20,403 --> 01:48:21,156
very good

1281
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:24,047
Aliens there being attacked?

1282
01:48:24,556 --> 01:48:26,209
very cool - yes cool -

1283
01:48:26,234 --> 01:48:28,037
That's why we have to take care of them - I understand -

1284
01:48:28,267 --> 01:48:29,712
We take care of them

1285
01:48:30,446 --> 01:48:31,367
I love you my love

1286
01:48:31,486 --> 01:48:33,502
I love you Uncle Thor

1287
01:48:35,777 --> 01:48:37,421
They are always there for us

1288
01:48:37,517 --> 01:48:38,675
walking in space

1289
01:48:38,794 --> 01:48:40,882
And his daughter who was born of Eternity

1290
01:48:41,121 --> 01:48:43,092
And it has the power of god

1291
01:48:45,626 --> 01:48:46,883
Two soldiers

1292
01:48:47,344 --> 01:48:50,688
In a good fight, they fight for those who cannot fight

1293
01:48:56,201 --> 01:48:59,998
They traveled to many places and gave them many names

1294
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,438
But for those who know it

1295
01:49:03,033 --> 01:49:06,918
They are known as love and lightning

1296

1299
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:02,526
...

1300
01:51:07,968 --> 01:51:10,257
They beg for mercy on you

1301
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:14,218
But they never know if you’re really listening or not

1302
01:51:15,969 --> 01:51:16,969
now

1303
01:51:17,948 --> 01:51:19,875
You know they look at the sky

1304
01:51:20,483 --> 01:51:22,746
They don't ask for thunder anymore

1305
01:51:23,453 --> 01:51:25,336
If they don't ask for rain

1306
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:30,990
They just want to see one of those superheroes

1307
01:51:34,101 --> 01:51:36,084
When do we become a joke?

1308
01:51:39,596 --> 01:51:40,409
now

1309
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:43,212
No news on this yet

1310
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,239
They are afraid of us again

1311
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:56,448
Do you understand what I mean by Hercules?

1312
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,816
Do you understand what I'm saying, my son?

1313
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:01,320
yes dad
