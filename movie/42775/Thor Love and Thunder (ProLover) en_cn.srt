We need to find a damn. Mostly, so
we can download the distress signal.
我们要找到那该死的遥控器，这样我们就能下载到呼救信号了

I'll retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?
你都去过哪里，可能把遥控器放哪了

277
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:10,880
One of the goats
probably ate it.
可能被其中的一只山羊吃了也说不定

Everybody, just relax.

The goats are going
to be fine.

289
00:22:31,736 --> 00:22:33,525
If not, turn them to meat.
如果有问题，再做成肉

290
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:37,057
King people.
Meat-eating people.
再带他们去见国王一行人 (meat肉和 meet见 同音)

291
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:40,277
- They have great conversation starters.
- And you told me to come in the middle.
- 它们也是很好的破冰话题
- 而且他们告诉我用这种特殊的口哨就可以召唤它们

292
00:22:40,302 --> 00:22:42,595
- Ichu Musu.

stay with the ship.
是呀，你不是说要一直呆在船上吗

It's not my fault.
不管我的事儿

405
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:32,238
I've never even seen these things,
whoever the hell they are.
我从没见过这些，不管这是啥东西

406
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,373
Welcome back.
欢迎回来

407
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:43,330
Die!
去死吧！

408
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:00,211
Whos' the new guy?
新人是谁呀？

409
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:02,713
That guy...
You're gonna love that guy.
那家伙... 你会爱上那家伙的

410
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,871
Mjölnir.

411
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:19,492
Mjölnir!

412
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,914
It's me, Thor.
是我啊，索尔

413
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:22,032
Have you seen my hammer?
你们看到我锤子了吗

414
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,867
Mjölnir, here boy.

415
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:26,585
Mjölnir?

416
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:32,443
Mjölnir.

417
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:39,486
You're back.
你回来了

418
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:44,244
Mjölnir!

419
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,815
'Scuse me.
Hello.
不好意思


420
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:15,271
That's my hammer, you bonehead.
那可是我的锤子，你个憨憨

421
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,459
and that's my look.
这还是我的造型

422
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:26,435
Hey!

423
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:30,469
Enough tomfoolery, wench.
别闹了 丫头

424
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:32,735
Take off that mask
and reveal yourself.
摘掉那面具现出你自己 

425
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,540
Granted.
明了

426
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:36,500
Hey.

427
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:37,973
Jane?!
简?

428
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,263
Let me tell you the
legend of Thor and Jane.
让我来给你们讲个索尔与简的传奇故事

429
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:50,310
He was a God of Thunder.
他曾是雷神

430
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:52,790
And she, a woman of science.
而她，是个女科学家

431
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,076
And although they were
from different worlds...
虽然他们来自不同世界

432
00:31:57,989 --> 00:32:00,155
Somehow, it just made sense.
然而不知为何，他们还是水到渠成

433
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:04,546
And together, they embarked
on the journey of love.
两人一起，踏上了爱情的旅程

434
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:12,693
Thor taught Jane,
the way of the warrior.
索尔教给简无畏的战士之道

435
00:32:14,888 --> 00:32:17,646
And Jane taught Thor,
the way of the people.
而简教给索尔人际之道

436
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:23,384
And as time passed, their
love grew deeper and deeper.
渐渐的，他们对彼此的爱越来越深

437
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:28,854
Incredible.
Isn't she, Mjölnir?
她真是太难以置信了，不是吗，Mjonir

438
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,700
I need you to promise me,
you'll always protect her.
我需要你向我保证，你会一直守护着她

439
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,664
I love you too, buddy.
我也爱你，老铁

440
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,651
A love that deep, has a way
of becoming magical.
爱之深切，都产生了魔法效应

441
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,525
Thor set a path towards a future
and all it might hold.
索尔为未来开辟了道路，也明白一切可能的走向

442
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:59,954
But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.
当他越是畅想着与简的生活，他越是害怕有天终会失去

443
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,415
And although Jane didn't want to admit it,
而虽然简也不想承认

444
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,616
she was scared of loss as well.
但她也非常害怕一切终会从指尖流逝

445
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:10,739
And so, they built walls between them.
于是，两人都渐渐的筑起了高墙

446
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,981
Thor got busy,
saving humanity.
索尔一天天忙着拯救人类

447
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:15,356
Heimdall!
海姆达尔

448
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,636
Jane got busy, doing the same.
简 同样的也忙于科研

449
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,664
Real busy.
特别忙

450
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:24,368
And eventually, the space
between them grew and grew
慢慢的 两人间的距离愈来愈远

451
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:26,556
Until it became too wide to bear.
直到这距离远得难以承受

452
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:33,813
Some things
had to give.
总要有人做出妥协

453
00:33:33,813 --> 00:33:37,879
I have to stay up all night,
then go through this data.
我得熬夜整理这么多得数据

454
00:33:37,903 --> 00:33:39,986
While I just stay up all night
eating and clean all of this up.
而我为等你也熬了一夜，又自己吃又得收拾这一桌子

455
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:41,801
There's two plates!
就俩盘子

456
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,497
And then one night,
it didn't give.
终于有一晚，没有妥协只剩下了失去

457
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,536
Jane wrote a note.
简留了张字条

458
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,639
And Thor read that note.
索尔读这张字条

459
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,517
And their legend
suddenly became myth.
而这传奇的一对儿 就这样戛然而止

460
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,376
Or so they thought.
或是他们是这么认为的

461
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,439
You okay?
你还好吗

462
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:08,930
Yes.
是

463
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,634
It's a little hot,
isn't it?
只是有点喘不过气

464
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:12,850
It's just a feeling.
可能只是对这头盔

465
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,594
Bit claustrophobic
with the helmet.
有点幽闭恐惧

466
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:20,883
How?!
怎么回事?!

467
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,665
Can we talk about this later?
我能过后再给你解释吗?

468
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:26,966
Yeah, sure.
当然

469
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:28,309
Great seeing you!
很高兴见到你!

470
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,098
What?!
什么情况?!

471
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:20,235
Hey! Is that the Necrosword?
嘿! 这是死灵之剑吗?

472
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,033
That's cool. I've only ever
read about it in stories.
酷, 我还只是在书中读到过它

473
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:26,126
Then, you know
this is going to hurt.
那你应该知道这剑的厉害了

474
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,463
Pain.
疼痛

475
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:29,881
What is pain, but a construct
invented by the weak.
啥是疼痛,  那只不过是弱者发明的一个概念

476
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:31,373
Oh, okay!
That's very sharp!
啊, 别!
这个是有点锋利!

477
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,897
Ready?
Hey
准备好了吗?

478
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,842
Don't touch my things.
别瞎碰我的东西

479
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:13,905
You better run,
you coward.
你最好逃跑, 你个怂货

480
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:36,356
The children!
They're taking the children!
孩子! 他带走了孩子们! 

481
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:38,622
- Mommy!

00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:07,667
Shadow monsters,
disgusting.
暗影怪物, 真是卑鄙

485
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:13,033
Flew around the world twice, nothing.
绕地球飞两圈了, 没发现任何踪迹

486
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:15,751
Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.
这孬种肯定逃走了, 会给我们找到的

487
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:20,940
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- Ah, you're telling me.
- 真是个突然的重逢呐
- 可不是嘛

488
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,109
What's it been like?
Three, four years?
这都过了多久了?
得有三, 四年了吧

489
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:25,587
Eight years, seven months and six days.
八年, 七个月 零 六天

490
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:26,780
I haven't forgotten.
我没忘呢

491
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,710
The last time I saw you or
didn't see you, because you left.
上次我见到你或是没见到你, 因为你离开了

492
00:37:30,202 --> 00:37:33,011
Kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.
说是我离开了有点过于简化了吧

493
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:35,255
Ah, no, you left.
You did.
确实是你离开了呀

494
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,590
You wrote me
a beautiful handwritten letter.

495
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,658
I should know,
I was there.
我知道, 因为当时我就在那

496
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,932
- You weren't there, actually.
- I was.
- 事实上是你不在, 
- 我在

497
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:42,371
And the note...
才有的信

498
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:47,809
And if you weren't there to see me
leave, then maybe it was you that left.
如果你没眼见我离开，那也许是你离开了

499
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:49,316
Fair point.
是有点道理

500
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,253
- Not that matters, like...
- No.
- 反正现在也都不重要了 不是吗
- 是啊

501
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:53,827
- Keeping track, right?
- Yeah.
- 继续搜索吧
- 对

502
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,464
It's supposed we both left
and both got left.

Now, you're leaving again.

accounts from all the witnesses.
米克, 我们需要所有目击者的详细陈述。

505

children who've been lost.
达里尔, 列出所有失踪孩子的姓名

506
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,029
- Your Majesty, my daughter isn't here.
- Don't worry.
- 陛下, 我的女儿被带走了
- 别担心

507
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:09,802
And she'll be found.
她会被找到的

508
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:12,646

伙计, 他们正流血呢, 赶紧送去医务室

509
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:14,461

510
00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:17,839

performance of this entire debacle?

People need entertainment.

512
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,267
Particularly now,
in times of crisis.
尤其是在这危急的时刻

513
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:22,267
Who did this?
尤其的

514
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:26,046
I did not hear a "no".
我没听到她回应"不"

515
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:27,795
Nor did I.

Asgard, at night.

517
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:30,601
We open on some
sleeping children.

519
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:39,694
- The old ex-girlfriend,

Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend
一定很难吧对你来说

With what?
用什么起

534
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,826
- Half our soldiers are dead.
- Half our soldiers are always dead.
- 我们一半儿的士兵都挂了
- 我们一半儿的士兵早就挂了

541
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,135

My friends,
we must not quarrel.
我的朋友们, 我们一定不要争吵

打扰下 米克

What are you doing?

558
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:31,339
Stormbreaker,
what are you doing?

559
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:33,033

Your cape is on fire.

565
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:43,088

He travels through shadows.

And he creates
monsters with them.

What's a Necrosword?
什么是死灵之剑

It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands, since the dawn of time.
相传是自时间存在就传承下来的古代兵器

575
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,146
It has the ability to slay gods.
有能力屠戮众神

576
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:02,303
It slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...
它会慢慢侵蚀并腐化持有者, 也就意味着

577
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:05,240
- Oh, so it infected him.
- It's infecting him. Yes, it must be.
- 哦 剑正在影响着他的行为
- 是的, 他肯定是受剑影响的

cursed shadow, zombie kidnapper.

use my magic powers yet.
我还不太会控制我的魔法

going to be the most powerful.

just go launching in there.
你说得对, 我们不能这么冒然过去

he has a second name.
我不确定他还有复名

Ninny of the Nonny.
我族的神也会在那, 妮妮闹妮神

Look what just happened.
你也看到刚才发生的了

那我们也不能都驾你的传送小飞马去呀

667
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,178
- We won't all fit.
- What are you talking about?
- 也也驼不下我们全部人呐

668
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:36,985
Warsong's awesome.

Stormbreaker's
awesome too.

Stormbreaker just
needs a conduit.

Anything that can
handle space travel.

It has the power
to get us there.

Just need something
to focus that energy

675
00:44:45,618 --> 00:44:47,929
So it's not so...
unpredictable.
让它得以掌控

676
00:44:47,954 --> 00:44:48,532
You know, uh.
知道吧, 额

677
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:51,554
If we had a ship, we could harness it
and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

Throw all those seats.

That's essential.

Bet you moved on quick, didn't you.

688
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,919
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

I've been meaning to apologize.

Sort of acting a little weird before.
为我之前我奇怪的行为

692
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:29,160
I just haven't really been myself lately.
You know, now that...
我只是最近有点迷失自我, 最近 我在

Trying to figure out who I am and
uh, just felt a little bit lost
试图弄清楚自己到底是谁
呃，只是觉得有点迷失

And then all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me.
然后突然，

It's a lot for me, too.

698
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,649

699
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:41,883
How did this happen?

Mjölnir call to me.

And so I came to investigate and...

Thor.

Mom, don't leave me.

The sink would say otherwise.

You think I really
should be coming?

I'm not getting any better.
我的病没有半点好转

721

Of course, you should come.
你是雷神，你肯定得来呀

Besides, what else
are you gonna do?

You're a Viking now.

Means you pretty much
have to die in battle.

725
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,987
It needs to be
devastatingly painful.
还得是个惨烈的牺牲

726
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:26,925
Otherwise, you
don't get into Valhalla.

and raven mail.

And meetings that could
have been raven mail.

733
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,095
I miss fighting.

I miss my sisters.

736
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:41,647
Because I need Thor.

737
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:44,514

Are you packed?
你收拾好了吗

739
00:47:48,262 --> 00:47:48,902
Yes.
好

740
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:52,627
A hand grenade?
手榴弹？

741
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:54,201
No, it's a portable speaker.
不，便携式扬声器

742
00:48:01,335 --> 00:48:02,753
Let's go.
我们出发

743
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:07,195
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps.
如果你不介意的话，水槽的事情请帮我保密

744
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,221
I got you.
没问题

745
00:48:10,743 --> 00:48:12,926
My fellow Asgardians...
我的阿斯加德子民们

746
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:13,855
Wish us well.
祝福我们吧

747
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,979
For we shall travel with
the speed of Odin's ravens.
让我们以奥丁雀信的速度穿行

748
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:19,939
We will return with children.

00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:26,748
Then we should feast,
along the children.

751
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:28,503
We do not do that anymore.
往日不堪回首

752
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:30,110
It was dark times.
那确实是我们的至暗时刻

Okay, we should go.

755
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:21,603
So...
Still rollerblading?
还滑旱冰吗

756
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:23,430
No, no.
You?

757
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,809
Oh yeah, every weekend.

Once you blade, you never fade.
一日旱冰人，一世旱冰魂

759

- 对吧， Korg？

760
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:29,244
Hey, can I run something by you?

00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:32,281
So I was thinking,
when we get to the bad guy...
我正在想，当我们遇到坏人时

763
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:35,110
What about if I had, like,
the cool catchphrase, like...
我是不是应该有个酷炫的口号什么的，就像

764
00:49:35,134 --> 00:49:37,218
"Eat this hammer, bang!"
“吃这一锤 bang！”

765
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:38,587
Or like?

"Check out my hammer, boom!"
“看我锤子的厉害， Boom！”

767
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:42,248
Like, what about?
又或者是

768
00:49:42,248 --> 00:49:44,377
You know,
I'm workshopping it.
你知道的， 我还在构思当中

769
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:46,902
No, they... They're all
really good. Mine is uh...
不用担心，他们都挺棒的，我的口号是

"This ends here and now."
“这将到此为止了”

Oh, that's such a good one.

772
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:51,490
Took me a long
time to perfect it.
花了我好长时间才完善的

773
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:52,959
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:54,494
This is my first bad guy.

You never forget your first.

776
00:49:58,978 --> 00:49:59,775

00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,602
So you got a girlfriend?
那么 你有女朋友了吗

778
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:04,239
Oh, no, no.

784
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:17,692
- Who's so cool?

- What?

788
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:24,247
Sensing feelings?

Feelings, what?
With Jane?

- 是呀
- 不可能，别犯傻了

791

The last time we had feelings
were long time ago. Long, long gone.
上次有感觉，那都是老久之前了

Not even...
She said you had feelings.
早就没感觉了, 还是你有感觉吗

Mate, relax.
We're on the same team.
放松点儿，伙计

Team Jane.
简队

796
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:46,746
Thing about Thor is that
he always bounces back.
索尔一定会来的

797
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:49,587
Like when Hela stole his
hammer, he went and built an ax
就像上次海拉摧毁了他的锤子后，他就去造了个斧头

798
00:50:49,612 --> 00:50:51,801
which is forcing
the heart of a dying star.
由一颗垂死行星的心脏能量铸成

he used to cut off Thano's head.
也是砍掉萨诺斯脑袋的战斧

800
00:50:58,737 --> 00:51:00,936
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

801
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,272
What a neat story.
多么简练的故事呀

802

Looks like a shy...

And what about the others?

Asgardians...

00:58:36,928 --> 00:58:39,827
I thought you've seen the
last of him when Odin died.
我还以为奥丁死时他的后代也跟着灭绝了

There is no thunder?

00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,111
Just the sound of lightning?
就只有几声轻雷而已

957
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,509
Good jab, dad!
说的漂亮，老爸！

958

Zeus, this is bigger than this.

He's taken Asgardian children.

Not good.

is causing panic.

Three, don't talk back to Zeus.
第三，别跟宙斯顶嘴

If you do that,
I put your clothes back on.

It's the Golden Temple of the Gods.
我弹

and nudy Twister.
可不是什么粗俗的裸体盛宴

My lightning bolt is
called Thunderbolt.

secret weapon like this...
如果你要跟别人借他的秘密武器

That you should, at least, get
the name right when you ask.

01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,880

998

He will not reach Eternity.

What does he mean,
"reach Eternity"?

Eternity.

It's a very powerful being at
the center of the universe.
是一个无比强大的存在，身处宇宙的中心

1006
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:34,003
He will grant the desire of
the first person who reaches it.
传说他会满足第一个到达他那的人的任何愿望

1007
01:01:34,028 --> 01:01:35,528
Like a wishing well?
像个许愿井吗？

1008
01:01:37,964 --> 01:01:40,701
What do you think a guy called,
the God Butcher, would wish for?
你认为一个叫屠神者的人会有什么愿望呢

1009
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:43,972
If he seeks the altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.
如果他想办法去到了永恒，他很可能一次性抹除我们全部

1010
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:47,015
- Zeus, we must act now.
- He's not going to make it.
- 宙斯，我们必须得出手了

He doesn't have the key.
他没有钥匙

1012
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,386
Is this the
purpose of the gods?

1013
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:54,222
To hide away in a
golden palace, like cowards?
躲藏在金色圣殿之中，像群胆小鬼一样

1014
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:56,349
Maybe we have lost our way.
也许我们已经堕落了

1015

You know what?
We're gonna stop him ourselves.
知道吗，我们还是自己去阻止他吧

I am afraid,
I cannot allow that.

Yes,

1029
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:28,331
Hell, yeah!

01:02:31,395 --> 01:02:33,122
Oy,
you didn't say "go".

I'm perishing.

You're next, Odinson!

That's the sound of the Viking.

1044
01:03:58,835 --> 01:03:59,735
No.

Thor, I'm down here.
我在下面呢

原来，科南族唯一活着的部位就只是他们的嘴

Really?
真的吗

bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.
事实上，你们可能是我见过最勇敢的阿斯加德人了

All of you.

being brave, alright?
所以， 我需要你们继续保持勇敢，好吗？

You're a team now.

Team kids in a cage.

I think we can do that.

01:06:22,066 --> 01:06:23,139
- Thor?

How are the children?
孩子们怎么样了

As you can imagine, they're a
little bit scared because they're kids.
你也能想象到，他们有点害怕，因为他们还是孩子

1092
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,329
But I told him that
everything is going to plan.
但我告诉他们一切都在依照计划进行

1093
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:37,264
And so you lied to them.

1094
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:38,398
You still have a plan?
你还有计划吗

1095

- 是的，有计划
- 根本就没有计划了

- No, there's no plan.

1097
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:44,104
We failed to raise a god army.
我们要组建神军的计划失败了

1098
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:45,471
- Korg is dead.

- Korg 还牺牲了
- 他没牺牲

- 我没死呀

1100
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:49,576
And you, you were properly humilated.
还有你，你刚刚才被彻底的羞辱了一番

1101

No, I got properly naked,
which I'm okay with.
没有，我只是被彻底脱光了而已，我感觉没啥大不了的

- I was okay with it.
- 简？

1103
01:06:53,882 --> 01:06:55,052
- Korg?
- I loved it.
- Korg?
- 我爱了

1104
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:59,052
We're not going into the Shadow Realm
weaker than we were before. We...
我们不能比之前还弱的进入暗域，我们

1105
01:06:59,052 --> 01:07:00,540
- We're gonna die.
- No one's gonna die.
- 我们很可能有去无回的
- 我们不会去送死的

1106
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:01,621

Everything is fine.
We did great back there.
一切都还好， 我们刚刚已经干得很棒了

- 我们杀了宙斯
- 你杀了宙斯

be catastrophic for the whole universe.
为你们，有可能会成为整个宇宙的灾难

1110
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,822
And surely,
毋庸置疑的

1111
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:12,699
The entire god kingdom is probably gonna
hunt us down for the rest of our days.
整个众神国度恐怕要从此追捕我们直至余生了

01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:15,511
But listen, you stole
this beautiful weapon.

Alright, this is the army right here.
看吧，它本身就是一个军队

它润滑，纤细，它强大，又美丽

For you, Valkyrie.
而高兴，女武神

1117
01:07:24,744 --> 01:07:26,158
I mean, it's not
really what I'm into.
我意思是，这不是我顺手的武器

1118
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:28,314
But I got my,
my weapon out there.

Ah!

Yeah?
是吧？

1125
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:51,432
I mean, I don't feel weird having
my ax weapon around, but come on.
我是指 我在旧锤面前可没感觉到别扭，但真的别闹了

1126
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:53,463
Mjölnir, in the past.

a little lava pool.

the answers in the bottom of the bottle.
而现在你也只是在最糟糕的情况下努力寻找答案

我朋友告诉我, 再次有感觉即使是糟糕的感觉也是件好事情

to never experience love,
就算会失去的爱也比从未感受过爱强
