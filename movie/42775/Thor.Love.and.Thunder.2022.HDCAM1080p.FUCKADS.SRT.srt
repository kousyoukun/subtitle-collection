1
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:40,026
Trusted.

2
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,286
What do we have here?

3
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,826
Gobbling up all my fruit.

4
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:40,936
Oh, it's one of mine.

5
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,420
Last cycle we have lost everything,

6
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,740
my Lord, the land is dry,
all life is lost,

7
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,143
but our faith in you never wavered

8
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,993
and now we await the promise.

9
00:03:58,913 --> 00:03:59,186
Perfect.

10
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:02,206
This is funny.

11
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,406
He thinks there's
an eternal reward.

12
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:16,176
No, sorry, there's no eternal
reward for you dog.

13
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,936
What we're celebrating
was a fresh kill.

14
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,323
We just vanquished the holder
of the Necro sword before it

15
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,513
could harm any other gods curse

16
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,263
and planned threatened to ruin
my entire empire.

17
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,576
Oh my God.

18
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:34,576
In the end.

19
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,466
There'll be more followers
to replace you.

20
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,683
They're always over,

21
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,143
we have suffered.

22
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:46,646
And we have started.

23
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:51,446
My daughter died.

24
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:59,006
And will you should suffer
for your gods as your only parents.

25
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:02,416
There's nothing for you all to do except.

26
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:05,176
Sure.

27
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,406
Our announce you.

28
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:22,276
Now you're moving.

29
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,056
He does have a purpose.

30
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:28,426
Yourself to me.

31
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:10,216
Everyone.

32
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:14,656
Feel like I could.

33
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:20,076
Promise.

34
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,496
Oh gosh.

35
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:14,226
Come.

36
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:18,736
Come get around and listen
to the legend of the space.

37
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,216
Hey can you?

38
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,795
Raised in the way of the Warrior,

39
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,833
Four was taught to help him
better fighting the good fight.

40
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:44,226
And you.

41
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,036
Discriminate.

42
00:07:56,183 --> 00:08:00,636
Another time he loved a wolf woman
on a woman, wolf.

43
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:03,746
One true love.

44
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:06,016
Jenny

45
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:13,486
it's sadly in the battle
for the four lost.

46
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:18,336
He lost a lot of people
in those days.

47
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:20,776
This mom is dead.

48
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:25,836
And hondo?

49
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:37,836
To watch this planet explode
the daily, see what have I done?

50
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,010
It seems that everything
and everyone he knows he lost

51
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,553
and so we put the child and the things
that she borrowed to it

52
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,173
could never be broken again.

53
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:49,606
Because he was down.

54
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:54,856
He teamed up with the Guardians of the.

55
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,770
Putting

56
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,013
turning pains at the games
and never skipping leg day.

57
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:09,546
Even from dead body.

58
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:15,486
But there was still a sad point
just trying to get back.

59
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,330
The boxes

60
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,283
over the years couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.

61
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:28,316
So he gave up his search for them.

62
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,966
Excepting that he was only
good for one thing.

63
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:36,266
Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say.

64
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:40,016
We need your help
to win this better.

65
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:42,266
Go on.

66
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,516
We need your help
to win this.

67
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:48,386
Come on.

68
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:53,056
OK.

69
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:55,086
People die.

70
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:56,556
Gianna.

71
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,576
Everybody well.

72
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:26,486
through

73
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:33,096
You said this would be
a relaxing holiday.

74
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,916
I said it was going to be
like a relaxing holiday.

75
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:49,386
God of Thunder.

76
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:50,706
Here's your car.

77
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:53,216
You have finally joined our fight.

78
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:55,696
Later than normal.

79
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:01,036
As you know, we used to live
in a peaceful US.

80
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,410
You know gods were murdered

81
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,053
and now they could tell him

82
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,513
that's being left unguarded

83
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,373
and help with his horse
to control his car.

84
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,666
With this out of
most sacred shrine.

85
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:21,006
Driving your car, tell them
what happened here today.

86
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:22,926
Tell us the charge is 4.

87
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,820
Mötley Crüe misfit desperados
around the time the problem,

88
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,153
hence their name to history.

89
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,066
I'll tell you this for free.

90
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:44,916
Whoa.

91
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:53,976
We can collectively take credit
for that because we worked as a team.

92
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:58,926
Our minds to defeat
the enemy with minimal loss.

93
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:08,766
What classic porn?

94
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:35,136
Good luck.

95
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:36,466
Yeah.

96
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:38,496
Read it.

97
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,446
You're you're doctor Tim Foster.

98
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:47,336
Hi hi, how's the I'm Sam Rosen bridge?

99
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:49,026
It's tough.

100
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:50,186
Yeah, really tough.

101
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,686
You ever see it,
then horizon no.

102
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:57,766
Inner side no.

103
00:14:57,943 --> 00:14:58,696
That may be explained.

104
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,203
Everything really clearly alright
the Einstein Rosen Bridge hold space

105
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,613
so that point A and point B.

106
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:10,246
Coexist in space
and time like that.

107
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,156
Just really drop off, yeah?

108
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,496
Watch those Movies OK?

109
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:22,936
Again.

110
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,326
So how's that going?

111
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,256
It's going amazing.

112
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:41,426
Have you?

113
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:43,676
All anyone else besides me?

114
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,836
When people find out,
they start acting weird.

115
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:47,266
They're just.

116
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:48,876
Different.

117
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:53,036
Anyway, it's not that serious.

118
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:55,206
She had stage four.

119
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:57,196
I was like how many stages?

120
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,466
Four that we know about.

121
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:06,496
Oh, you have a somewhere else?

122
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,446
You got to be right now
that's more important than chemo.

123
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:09,946
No.

124
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:19,486
You're trying to get back
to the lab, aren't you?

125
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:20,886
That had a few ideas.

126
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:21,526
I'm trying.

127
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,016
OK, no time out.

128
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,183
I know you think you're lab work
is something you have to do,

129
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,843
otherwise you're letting down
all the civilization, but.

130
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:31,196
You're not getting.

131
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,853
The universe is actually
trying to tell you,

132
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,343
so let me translate.

133
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:39,376
Slow down, you need your input
to fight this thing.

134
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:41,576
I'll find you.

135
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:48,346
FYI, my way does not have
to equal alone in a lab.

136
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,456
Maybe it's time to play
this space Viking hard.

137
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:54,816
It's not a card.

138
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:55,636
Yes it does.

139
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,346
There's no card,
there's a card.

140
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:59,636
It's tall, it's fun
and it's gorgeous.

141
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,436
It's a handsome card.

142
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,006
I will figure this out.

143
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,546
The results are coming back the same.

144
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:19,086
very

145
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:27,866
The second thing I can do,
or if you just want don't call me.

146
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:24,746
Because.

147
00:18:58,453 --> 00:18:59,536
Look at this place.

148
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:01,546
It's beautiful, oh.

149
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:04,556
We're here.

150
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:06,556
Yeah.

151
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,773
It is it is you and now
it is time for me

152
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,853
to pass on to the spirit realm.

153
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,293
I will take my place in the great backyard
in the Hall of Valhalla,

154
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,893
the resting place of the gods.

155
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:30,406
01 more thing.

156
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:32,886
You have a sister.

157
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:40,370
And so now I turn into Godly
Stardust and say farewell,

158
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,410
who looked

159
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,963
to see what happened.

160
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:57,506
Brother

161
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,526
behind us truthful?

162
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,420
No, I would

163
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,253
just stick.

164
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,793
My claim is the rightful
air from the frog

165
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,683
and no one will stop me.

166
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:25,676
Join you.

167
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:38,066
That guy.

168
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,400
You can almost feel the power
of these magnificent

169
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,093
and immovable stones.

170
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,690
OK, let's head back to the village

171
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,633
where we can drink some real Asgardian meat.

172
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:03,726
Come on.

173
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:40,786
God of the South.

174
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:42,660
we

175
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,593
A bit more forever
without the protection of our gods,

176
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,813
but now peace shall read
in return for your service.

177
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:54,746
Please accept these gifts.

178
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,480
Protectors of our world
of

179
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,463
peace.

180
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:06,936
They are wonderful.

181
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:11,696
Thank you so much.

182
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:13,826
Listen none about the table.

183
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:16,906
I don't talk about the time, you know,
if you were talking, I think it's important.

184
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:21,706
Don't forget the goats.

185
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:24,946
Now back.

186
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:28,756
But how beautiful they are?

187
00:22:31,123 --> 00:22:32,066
Screen quite a lot.

188
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:34,636
Don't worry.

189
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:37,946
Get down over the stress signal.

190
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:43,436
Ridiculous.

191
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:50,216
Putting them down.

192
00:22:58,473 --> 00:22:58,856
You OK?

193
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:02,436
Be fine.

194
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,113
Dude, people meeting people
that have great conversation starter

195
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,738
and has been totally consuming them
with the special

196
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,833
because something like this.

197
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:14,036
You know there's nothing.

198
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:16,756
You have a gun.

199
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:19,946
Are you guys crazy?

200
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:24,026
Even in this whole time, yeah,
you should stay with the ship.

201
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,046
This is Glenda.

202
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:26,146
We're married.

203
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:32,140
Talking about shopping
and the relationships that I should bring,

204
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,023
you can't get married
on every single planet we land on.

205
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:38,146
Finally.

206
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:40,536
distress calls

207
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:45,336
God put your.

208
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:48,116
These

209
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:56,036
the horror who could have done
something like this?

210
00:23:58,483 --> 00:23:59,526
What was that about?

211
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:01,596
Play that one.

212
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,200
We need to hear

213
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,083
your friends in danger.

214
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:08,946
We must go with.

215
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:14,036
Maybe we should split up
so many people to save him.

216
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:15,856
Look at all this distress.

217
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:22,776
Thor's gonna be OK.

218
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,116
I admire your
commitment to each other.

219
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:26,226
That's a beautiful thing.

220
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:28,046
The last something
I never happened.

221
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:30,766
If I may, you may.

222
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,023
After thousands of years of living,

223
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,563
you don't seem to know
who the hell you are.

224
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,800
I've been lost before

225
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:38,973
then.

226
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:39,686
I found meaning.

227
00:24:39,763 --> 00:24:40,566
I found love.

228
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,836
And you have got taken from me.

229
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:43,916
And God that hurts.

230
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,256
But that shitty feeling is better
than feeling empty.

231
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,500
My hope for you is that one day
you will find something

232
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,843
to make you feel this shit.

233
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,023
It didn't work out and I'm going
to die in original deathly dumping

234
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,273
with a handwritten letter.

235
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,266
I don't know what she was
before I actually everyone it almost like.

236
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:11,556
I knew this would happen.

237
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:12,376
You must be over.

238
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,736
I'll fight shift.

239
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:16,426
He wants the other calls
the Galaxy needs.

240
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:17,496
His guardians cool.

241
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:18,396
Yeah, we were just leaving.

242
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:21,476
This way you have to trust me.

243
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:23,346
Ease the pain.

244
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,042
Why don't you

245
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,883
take this ship?

246
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,656
There's a parking farewell gift.

247
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,556
Are you giving me my shift?

248
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,836
Yes, she's yours.

249
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,033
Maybe you make as many memories with her

250
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,543
as I have just a temperamental blaster.

251
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:38,976
Will serve you well and tiger
people start the show.

252
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:40,576
Thank you goodbye old friend.

253
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,120
Human handshake

254
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,690
as guardian shake into the snake
that you cannot trust is

255
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,413
really dragging this out and finish
the classic as God in high one.

256
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:59,746
Let's go take care of my crew.

257
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,076
This is going to be hard for them.

258
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:04,376
Remember what I told you?

259
00:26:05,903 --> 00:26:06,886
You feel lost.

260
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:10,396
There's something in the eyes
of the people that you love.

261
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:12,576
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

262
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:36,546
Hello again, it's me and you.

263
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:04,196
Or what is that?

264
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,256
Belgarion

265
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:09,736
you'll ever meet.

266
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,306
Which we found.

267
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:26,586
Missing at all.

268
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:30,156
No, leave me here.

269
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,924
You need to tie your warriors

270
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,583
on the bus or fields.

271
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,516
And then I can claim my place.

272
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,873
I hate to break it to you,

273
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,563
but you're a warrior to get into about how you
have to die in the battle you spied.

274
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:47,346
Here you are.

275
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:53,086
I've been hunting about man.

276
00:27:53,523 --> 00:27:54,546
I followed his ears.

277
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:55,726
It was a trap.

278
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:59,286
The garbage is coming.

279
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:01,736
He seeks the extinction
of the gods.

280
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:03,826
That's God is next.

281
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:00,066
So now.

282
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:03,636
Welcome back.

283
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:52,416
rihanna

284
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:45,216
happy

285
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:48,106
And that's my look.

286
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,076
Take off that mask.

287
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:17,746
Let me tell you the legend
of Thor and Jane.

288
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:23,436
He was a God of Thunder
and she of a woman of science.

289
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:26,816
And although they were
from different worlds.

290
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:30,536
It just makes sense.

291
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,026
In the jungle of love.

292
00:32:41,713 --> 00:32:43,306
Change the way of the world.

293
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:48,296
The way of the people.

294
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:53,786
And as time passed their life
from deeper and deeper.

295
00:32:58,263 --> 00:32:58,556
Should be.

296
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:05,136
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

297
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:13,226
Not that deep as the wave
becoming magical.

298
00:33:18,643 --> 00:33:20,986
Towards the future
and all that might hold.

299
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,930
But the more you ponder
the life of Jane,

300
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,263
the more he feared losing their life.

301
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,790
And although Jane didn't
want to admit it,

302
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,963
she was scared of loss as well.

303
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:41,246
And so they build walls between them.

304
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:44,146
Forever busy saving humanity.

305
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,696
Jane got busy doing the same.

306
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,220
Real busy

307
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,080
and eventually the space
between him grew and grew

308
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,213
until it became too wide to bear.

309
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:04,386
Something had to give.

310
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:08,336
Go through this data.

311
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:10,646
And we know this.

312
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:19,206
And then one night
it didn't give.

313
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:21,886
Jane voted note.

314
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,096
And so read that note.

315
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,906
And the legend suddenly
became the.

316
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:32,806
Was that they thought?

317
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:37,376
You're good.

318
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:40,866
Hawking.

319
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:47,416
Yeah.

320
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:55,506
Can we go with this lady?

321
00:34:57,783 --> 00:34:58,666
Great seeing you.

322
00:35:52,023 --> 00:35:52,466
Read about it.

323
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:54,286
And you know.

324
00:35:58,263 --> 00:35:59,566
What is the pain
that comes from?

325
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,356
You better run you coward.

326
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:37,276
Shadow monsters
disgusting.

327
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,486
Rather than twice nothing.

328
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:50,436
Where are you now?

329
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,670
You're telling me

330
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,923
3-4 years, eight years,
seven months and six days.

331
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,396
I didn't see you because you left.

332
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:05,936
Location to say
that I left you left you did.

333
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:08,056
You wrote me
a beautiful handwritten letter.

334
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,416
I should know I was there.

335
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:12,866
Actually has the note.

336
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,243
And if you weren't there
to see me leave,

337
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,043
then maybe it was you know that.

338
00:38:21,223 --> 00:38:24,026
Not that it matters,
just keeping track right?

339
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,036
Both got left.

340
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,876
Meek, Meek details the council might.

341
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:35,626
This is give me all the names
of the children who've been lost.

342
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,530
play

343
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:43,336
Get into the primary now.

344
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,410
Should we start working
on the performance of this entire device

345
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,123
to people need entertainment,

346
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,553
particularly now in times of crisis particularly.

347
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,516
I just ask you another.

348
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,796
Ask God, yes,
we are going to sleep.

349
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:07,086
So that's the ex girlfriend, is it?

350
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:11,406
The old ex girlfriend Judy
Foster Jane Foster.

351
00:39:11,903 --> 00:39:15,526
When they got away, when you go away
that means the skit.

352
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,643
Yeah yeah must be hard for you

353
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,573
to see your ex girlfriend and your ex
hammer hanging out and give him.

354
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:28,026
Could you have deeper?

355
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:31,846
Daddy

356
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:45,846
she's calling you with what our soldiers
are dead.

357
00:39:47,673 --> 00:39:48,966
Everyone was pleased.

358
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:56,546
You know?

359
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:12,146
My friends,
we must not quarrel.

360
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:16,006
Jobs like this and he's united
come together.

361
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:18,176
See what's happening here.

362
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:20,136
Afraid.

363
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:22,766
Scared.

364
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:25,296
Afraid.

365
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:26,566
Anxious.

366
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,510
The children we must first look within ourselves

367
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,153
and I'm sorry maybe it's
very hard around the speech,

368
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,370
but

369
00:40:37,316 --> 00:40:38,203
what are you doing?

370
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,536
He's taking minutes and precious minutes
we don't have.

371
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:42,306
But

372
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:47,346
you write that down week.

373
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:08,556
Couldn't find it.

374
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:11,156
Grow back.

375
00:41:13,853 --> 00:41:14,916
What do you know about this guy?

376
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:17,936
He travels through shadows
and he creates monsters with them.

377
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:21,166
Absolutely freaking monsters
are real connectors short.

378
00:41:21,243 --> 00:41:23,276
I don't know that much fear
in the face with it.

379
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:26,756
Weapon has been passed
through hands for dawn.

380
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,456
It has the ability
to slave gods.

381
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,383
It slowly corrupts and kills
the weapon wields it,

382
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,843
which means it affected it's infecting him.

383
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:38,606
Yes, so basically,
we're up against a curse.

384
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:40,486
Shadow zombie kidnapper.

385
00:41:41,113 --> 00:41:41,616
Awesome.

386
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:42,496
When do we need?

387
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:47,436
Can you see me flirting here
and there is that strange?

388
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:48,926
I'm his son.

389
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:50,726
Are you OK?

390
00:41:50,803 --> 00:41:54,256
And another thing about the name Astrid
and now known as Act?

391
00:41:55,093 --> 00:41:56,656
He's a singer
from a popular band.

392
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,452
I heard on that

393
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,753
Astrid, your father gave you
a very tough Viking name

394
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,283
and I tend to honor his wishes.

395
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:03,556
Absolutely Astrid.

396
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:03,856
I said.

397
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:04,816
Axel Astrid.

398
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:09,906
Where are you?

399
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:10,826
I'm not sure.

400
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,036
I don't know how to use
my magic eyes yet.

401
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,083
Your father taught me, you know,

402
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,553
I'm gonna teach you
I need you to focus.

403
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,186
And all that.

404
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:19,316
Focus.

405
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:21,216
Your eyes.

406
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,586
Hey, how's it going kids?

407
00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:32,466
How's it going?

408
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:33,446
Look where we are.

409
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,286
We're in a cage made spikes.

410
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,136
Are you going to do something?

411
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:42,696
Yes, but just not right now
on the vision look.

412
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:46,046
What will happen to us?

413
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:49,676
Very very bad situation.

414
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,256
You know, the good news
is has gardens.

415
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,110
So if you die,
you'll never

416
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,723
go away.

417
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,706
OK, I'm putting together
a really, really good team.

418
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,966
Yeah my ex girlfriend Jane,
which is a whole another story.

419
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,503
I went away with but it

420
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,343
is a top notch team
and then we're gonna have you here

421
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,763
before you know it, yeah.

422
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:33,396
He's running scared.

423
00:43:33,893 --> 00:43:34,616
We all are.

424
00:43:42,473 --> 00:43:43,256
Take care, thank you.

425
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:48,656
Through the shadow realm.

426
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:52,656
The atmosphere there has a darkness
like another.

427
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:54,736
This is a colour feels
to try, it's understandable.

428
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,050
Hello, we need

429
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,013
let's bring the rainbow.

430
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,196
Or something?

431
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,726
For a minute
I'm taking last.

432
00:44:05,803 --> 00:44:07,846
She's fine with it,
but the rest of it she needs work.

433
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:13,766
Yeah, jump the guy,
hang on.

434
00:44:13,843 --> 00:44:16,346
He moves through shadows, he's going
to the shadow realm.

435
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:17,466
It seems like that's
where it may be.

436
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:18,146
The most powerful.

437
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:18,546
You're right.

438
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:19,566
We can't just get lighting in.

439
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,760
There could be a trap
could be endangering the children

440
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,743
when you're reinforcements.

441
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:23,766
We must raise an army.

442
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:25,246
Are you thinking right thinking?

443
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:27,476
I'm thinking what are we thinking,
thinking, thinking?

444
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:32,266
What signify potency?

445
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:36,576
We have the greatest team ever.

446
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:39,896
We can recruit raw
Hercules to join.

447
00:44:44,653 --> 00:44:45,026
You see?

448
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,316
The second you think Michael
will be there in the afternoon.

449
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:54,576
Join our team, yes.

450
00:44:59,423 --> 00:45:01,016
You're not traveling in Stormbreaker janky?

451
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:02,686
Look, what just happened.

452
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:05,216
We can't exactly go in your tiny
little flying portables.

453
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:06,376
Can we run or fit?

454
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,066
Just need the parking anything
that can handle space travel.

455
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,563
I love when she talks about it,

456
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,853
has a power to get us there,

457
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,593
just need something to focus
that energy so it sounds so unpredictable.

458
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:21,466
You know if we had a shipment
to harness it used storm Breakers.

459
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:22,126
Power source.

460
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:26,546
I've got a shirt.

461
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:39,326
Central only, everyone
that's essential.

462
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:42,816
He moved on quickly.

463
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:46,666
Some piece of work.

464
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:48,936
All right?

465
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:51,686
Catching up with old friends.

466
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:54,406
I've been meaning to apologize.

467
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:58,286
Acting a little weird before I just haven't
really been myself lately.

468
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,033
Trying to figure out who I am and just felt
a little bit lost

469
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,613
and all of a sudden I see you dressed

470
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,643
as me and it's just kind of.

471
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:08,896
It's a lot for me too.

472
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:11,366
Did you guys get together?

473
00:46:11,443 --> 00:46:11,846
How did this?

474
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:15,986
I swear I heard me
on our call to me.

475
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,173
And so when I came here to investigate

476
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,253
and its pieces started glowing
and swirling and then Thor.

477
00:46:26,313 --> 00:46:27,036
It looks good on you.

478
00:46:27,113 --> 00:46:28,366
It works so.

479
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:33,156
Just checking.

480
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,676
See you later.

481
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:47,316
Would you talk?

482
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:00,626
Don't let.

483
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,036
Don't be afraid.

484
00:47:05,163 --> 00:47:05,706
Even when I've.

485
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:08,896
You won't be.

486
00:47:13,023 --> 00:47:14,036
And whatever happens.

487
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:17,396
Never stop.

488
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:35,396
Hey.

489
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:36,626
You all right.

490
00:47:37,303 --> 00:47:37,846
Great.

491
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:40,746
The samples are otherwise.

492
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,316
You think I really
should be coming?

493
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,526
I'm not getting any better.

494
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,366
Your thought, of course you should.

495
00:47:48,403 --> 00:47:50,986
Besides what else you gonna do,
you're biking now.

496
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,407
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle

497
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,643
and needs to be
devastatingly painful.

498
00:47:55,793 --> 00:47:56,896
Otherwise you don't get
into the hall.

499
00:47:57,763 --> 00:47:58,306
My plan.

500
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,366
You know, Canadian stuff.

501
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,046
I love being king.

502
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:06,106
I love my people, but it's all meetings
and Raven male meetings.

503
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,326
It could have been Raven male
and this fighting.

504
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,223
I miss my sisters,
which is why you need to come

505
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:11,783
because I need to.

506
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:13,566
OK.

507
00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:16,476
and

508
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:19,536
Yes.

509
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:23,176
I have grenade.

510
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:24,936
You can.

511
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:32,406
Ask.

512
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:37,246
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps.

513
00:48:38,023 --> 00:48:38,636
I thought you.

514
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:41,716
Why?

515
00:48:43,723 --> 00:48:46,006
Which as well
but we shall travel.

516
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:49,696
We were we're.

517
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:52,496
getting

518
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:56,370
child

519
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:57,620
do

520
00:48:58,263 --> 00:49:01,736
Anymore with the dark Times
dreadful times.

521
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:51,786
So you still roll.

522
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,613
You Oh yeah,

523
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,133
every weekend when she laid
you never fade right?

524
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,760
So I was thinking when we get
to the bad guy,

525
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,263
what about if I had like
a cool catch phrase like?

526
00:50:06,523 --> 00:50:06,876
Camera.

527
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,220
Check out the human

528
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:11,880
like

529
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,873
no, I'm not more shopping yet.

530
00:50:16,543 --> 00:50:19,496
Come on is this ends here now.

531
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,696
Took a long time
and the fact that you got it.

532
00:50:25,293 --> 00:50:26,316
Never forget any fuss.

533
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:30,306
Yeah.

534
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:32,566
You got a girlfriend?

535
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:35,486
No, not too busy.

536
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:36,166
Not on time.

537
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:36,446
You know.

538
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:41,126
Just walk and everything OK,
check this place out.

539
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:47,006
So cool.

540
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:49,706
The buildings are cool.

541
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:51,396
It's happening man.

542
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,833
Feelings, feelings what Jane
now know we were thinking

543
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,013
was feelings last time
we had feelings with long time

544
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,843
but long long gone.

545
00:51:01,953 --> 00:51:03,546
I think maybe you have feelings.

546
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,126
No, exactly what team
we're on, OK?

547
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:19,413
Think about though is that he always
bounces back like when he sold his hammer,

548
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,363
he went and built an axe

549
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,413
which was forged
in the heart of a dying star.

550
00:51:25,703 --> 00:51:28,186
And in the same house
was used to cut thousands head.

551
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:37,016
Story.

552
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,906
All this talk about jumping
off heads.

553
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:43,176
Oh, here we go.

554
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:46,546
Oh

555
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:52,726
this is aunty hello.

556
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,180
You know

557
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,193
how many his head ripped off?

558
00:52:04,603 --> 00:52:06,026
You liked it a second ago.

559
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,310
I knew a little girl just about you

560
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,463
and she was brave
and she was smart.

561
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,876
And she'd like to draw.

562
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:37,496
Let me ask you a question.

563
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,480
About gods are meant
to protect your right,

564
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,033
or where are they sores
on his way.

565
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,530
Yes,

566
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,383
counting on that.

567
00:52:51,283 --> 00:52:52,736
That's why you're here.

568
00:52:56,793 --> 00:52:59,426
Dictation on you said we have to keep
a low profile blending.

569
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,170
Luckily, disguises and my specialty

570
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:03,703
philosophy.

571
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,090
One of those actions

572
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,100
and the clerk to the Emotion valves

573
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,890
and color signifies different emotions

574
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:16,853
where the emotion goes.

575
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:23,346
Shit.

576
00:53:33,653 --> 00:53:36,296
Kids, the most powerful creative.

577
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:44,246
Or dreams?

578
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:49,876
Stay down.

579
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:54,236
Of the money.

580
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:14,246
The legend.

581
00:55:17,053 --> 00:55:17,886
Everyone's got.

582
00:55:18,173 --> 00:55:22,356
He's got lightning, but the Thunder inspiration
that's really good.

583
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:24,676
You should lead with that when you're asking
for an army.

584
00:55:26,913 --> 00:55:27,356
We just like.

585
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:10,906
I hear my open.

586
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:14,946
These falling council
over the world.

587
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:19,906
Well, we have many many serious mother
to be talked about.

588
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:21,076
Such.

589
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,246
What are we going to hold the shift?

590
00:56:25,923 --> 00:56:26,986
This guy for real.

591
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:29,116
I'm sure we have.

592
00:56:31,123 --> 00:56:31,366
Sorry.

593
00:56:33,063 --> 00:56:38,266
Of the immortal human full sacrifice
in the name of the world.

594
00:56:40,023 --> 00:56:41,286
Oh no, not good.

595
00:56:41,403 --> 00:56:43,266
You know, I don't think it's gonna get
any better than this.

596
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:44,843
Time can help,

597
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,763
but that Thunderbolt,
I think that might be the.

598
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,786
You go right for you go left.

599
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:52,016
We've gone rushing
take both doodle.

600
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:53,296
Let's go get it.

601
00:56:54,803 --> 00:56:55,396
ding dong

602
00:56:59,723 --> 00:57:00,506
Times right now.

603
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,726
Times not right now.

604
00:57:04,453 --> 00:57:05,196
These guys.

605
00:57:10,043 --> 00:57:13,456
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds
to speak last, literally heads.

606
00:57:15,113 --> 00:57:15,396
Why?

607
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:17,726
Hello.

608
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:21,216
Let me be the first to say it's an
honor and a privilege.

609
00:57:21,823 --> 00:57:22,486
I can't hear you.

610
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:26,046
Why don't you take
this stage stage down there?

611
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:30,266
Well, yes you see the area
that looks very much like a stage.

612
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:32,456
OK.

613
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:40,616
Come.

614
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:44,306
Good luck, rose.

615
00:57:53,093 --> 00:57:53,506
Zeus

616
00:57:56,283 --> 00:57:57,456
Gods of the universe.

617
00:57:58,323 --> 00:58:01,046
I come here to ask for your help
to raise an army.

618
00:58:01,763 --> 00:58:04,876
There's a maniac called the gold fortune
seeks to end us all.

619
00:58:05,073 --> 00:58:06,386
This disruption is everywhere.

620
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:11,226
Entire planets round been left
completely unprotected except nothing.

621
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:14,206
The chaos in each way
and I know where he is.

622
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:18,846
With your help we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

623
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:23,166
That guy he cares a couple
of low level God.

624
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:27,496
That's all pretty boy.

625
00:58:27,913 --> 00:58:29,576
You go back to your seat,
you big boy.

626
00:58:30,493 --> 00:58:32,826
Did you hear any of what I just said?

627
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,720
He's he's murdering on mass and kill you

628
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,330
one time now you shut
down you're required

629
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,993
because you are this close
to being uninvited to do.

630
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:46,626
Since we must use John,
you cannot come to it.

631
00:58:46,863 --> 00:58:49,786
You have to listen
to our safety check.

632
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,632
Just tell me

633
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,723
what is the signal he'll be go.

634
00:59:02,463 --> 00:59:04,966
Let's see who you are
and they've got the discount.

635
00:59:14,853 --> 00:59:15,266
You're too.

636
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:19,596
Fucking.

637
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:23,476
Great.

638
00:59:27,623 --> 00:59:29,006
We take off their disguise too.

639
00:59:32,263 --> 00:59:32,646
Discuss.

640
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:38,386
I thought you'd seen the last
of you with all that.

641
00:59:39,893 --> 00:59:41,676
You a thought?

642
00:59:42,763 --> 00:59:43,826
God of fire.

643
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,530
That is not

644
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,063
just the sound of lightning.

645
00:59:52,293 --> 00:59:53,266
This is bigger than us.

646
00:59:53,443 --> 00:59:55,816
He's taking our Guardian children look.

647
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,933
Do you think we have?

648
00:59:57,633 --> 00:59:58,100
They got.

649
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:02,167
Every girl watches
over their own people.

650
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,833
Nothing more, nothing less.

651
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:06,916
As guardian problem.

652
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,506
Has godian problems.

653
01:00:11,123 --> 01:00:12,436
I would imagine before.

654
01:00:13,273 --> 01:00:16,636
My hero Zeus afraid.

655
01:00:30,853 --> 01:00:33,266
What is I am scared?

656
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:38,356
Goal has been macrosoft,
which means he could kill.

657
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:41,576
And now you.

658
01:00:43,613 --> 01:00:43,776
Yes.

659
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:46,426
panic

660
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:49,636
We are the same.

661
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:50,740
you

662
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:52,506
You wanna say?

663
01:00:54,403 --> 01:00:54,746
The key.

664
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:56,116
why

665
01:00:58,193 --> 01:00:58,726
Anything?

666
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,160
in

667
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:03,810
the

668
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:06,426
dot

669
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:10,236
Now I put your clothes on.

670
01:01:15,253 --> 01:01:15,786
You stopped.

671
01:01:17,853 --> 01:01:18,456
Do you know now?

672
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:20,886
Enjoy.

673
01:01:21,703 --> 01:01:22,056
YouTube.

674
01:01:23,563 --> 01:01:23,906
My life.

675
01:01:24,693 --> 01:01:25,176
It's called.

676
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,203
So I'm trying to use somebody's
secret weapon like this,

677
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:30,353
but you should at least keep them.

678
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:31,390
why

679
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:34,216
I borrowed Thunderbolt.

680
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:03,566
No.

681
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,933
Those boys.

682
01:02:10,067 --> 01:02:11,133
We got muncher.

683
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,133
He will not reach it,
doesn't he?

684
01:02:14,767 --> 01:02:15,300
Maternity

685
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,600
what does it mean?

686
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:29,767
Eternity is very powerful,
being the center of the universe.

687
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,600
The grand design.

688
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:34,733
The first person who reaches it,
so it's like official.

689
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:41,667
What do you think of God called
the God Butcher wish for we see children.

690
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,533
We must act now.

691
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:46,700
He's not going to make

692
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,967
it, doesn't have the key.

693
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:53,733
The hideaway golden powers
like cowards.

694
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:55,567
Maybe we have lost our way.

695
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:59,567
You know, stopping ourselves
and afraid that killed.

696
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,967
This is a secret place.

697
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,933
Not only to the girls,
you know where we are.

698
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,867
They could use you to find out.

699
01:03:14,367 --> 01:03:15,100
So now.

700
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,800
You must stay.

701
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,167
God.

702
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,333
Could you live right now?

703
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:32,733
They go.

704
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:05,636
I'm down here.

705
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,267
Part of the problem is
a lot of this is not.

706
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,367
I need you to.

707
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:22,156
They need to go for it.

708
01:05:39,643 --> 01:05:39,946
Those.

709
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:36,216
Came in, rescued us
and we flew out.

710
01:06:38,063 --> 01:06:39,066
Another classic board.

711
01:06:40,223 --> 01:06:41,706
I can't believe
you're Zeus.

712
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,586
Well, you know they say
never meet your heroes.

713
01:06:46,693 --> 01:06:49,036
What's important is we are
on our way to you right now.

714
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:50,306
How are you guys doing?

715
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:51,156
Are you OK?

716
01:06:51,353 --> 01:06:54,346
Alright, well listen I know
what it's like to be scared.

717
01:06:55,203 --> 01:06:56,506
I'll tell you, how's your age.

718
01:06:57,203 --> 01:06:59,386
I don't think I would have been brave
as you really.

719
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:03,286
In fact, it might just be the bravest Asgardians
I've ever met, Holden.

720
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,370
Keep being brave

721
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,163
and take care of each other.

722
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,596
Your team now team kids
in the cage.

723
01:07:11,773 --> 01:07:12,496
Can you do that?

724
01:07:13,453 --> 01:07:15,126
Yeah, I think we can do that.

725
01:07:16,243 --> 01:07:16,846
I know you can.

726
01:07:22,063 --> 01:07:22,786
Thought yeah.

727
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:24,836
I'm glad I have my hero.

728
01:07:25,613 --> 01:07:26,136
Thanks buddy.

729
01:07:31,103 --> 01:07:31,826
How are the children?

730
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:33,003
As you could imagine,

731
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,773
a little bit scared
because the kids bop.

732
01:07:34,883 --> 01:07:36,446
I told them that everything
was going to plan.

733
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,116
Yes, there is a plan.

734
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:41,736
No, there's no plan.

735
01:07:41,873 --> 01:07:46,216
We failed to raise a Gold Army Corp
is dead, not dead.

736
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,890
He's ahead and you,

737
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,783
you got probably humiliated properly
naked, which I'm OK with James.

738
01:07:53,113 --> 01:07:54,296
OK, cool.

739
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:59,686
Going into the shower room weaker
than we were before we were going to die.

740
01:07:59,763 --> 01:08:02,506
No one's gonna die,
OK, everything's fine.

741
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:03,906
We did great back there.

742
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:04,896
We killed zoo.

743
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:08,100
They will be catastrophic community,

744
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:11,543
whole universe and surely entire God Kingdom
is probably hunters

745
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:12,683
down with the rest of our days.

746
01:08:12,793 --> 01:08:15,886
Wow, listen you stole
this beautiful weather all right.

747
01:08:15,963 --> 01:08:17,346
This is the army right here.

748
01:08:17,463 --> 01:08:19,766
It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful.

749
01:08:19,843 --> 01:08:20,646
It's beautiful.

750
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:23,216
The youth.

751
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:28,416
I mean, it's not really what I mean
to cause I've got my my work out there.

752
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:34,866
There you go, friend.

753
01:08:35,803 --> 01:08:37,656
That was quite connections
back then.

754
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:44,600
This is not

755
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:46,053
good.

756
01:08:46,963 --> 01:08:48,786
Yeah, I mean, that's really weird.

757
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:50,336
Happened by accident,
happened around.

758
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:52,906
Come on me all day
in the post.

759
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,240
Do you mean

760
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:55,773
you're welcome?

761
01:08:56,863 --> 01:08:58,136
You thought your first beer?

762
01:08:58,293 --> 01:08:59,096
What do you say?

763
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:08,136
Sorry been fighting lately.

764
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:16,920
Hey

765
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,903
oh hey.

766
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:25,246
If you want, yeah beautiful.

767
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:27,366
I just say that was
very very impressive.

768
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:28,336
When you get back there.

769
01:09:29,903 --> 01:09:30,566
Me over there.

770
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:40,096
Especially the Dolphins do this.

771
01:09:40,453 --> 01:09:42,016
You should see some space dolphins.

772
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:46,386
Beautiful.

773
01:09:49,263 --> 01:09:55,126
Very loyal creatures and then make the life
and actually 6 just love that.

774
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:01,476
You look so happy.

775
01:10:01,913 --> 01:10:04,516
Wanna get in your rocks?

776
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:07,846
When we get together,
we're going again.

777
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,933
Baby, that is the song that my dad's

778
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,623
and my other did we never
caught you with two friends.

779
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,923
Want to make a baby
they get together inside the mountain

780
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:23,163
and they go down to a little louder pool
they hold hands over the.

781
01:13:07,143 --> 01:13:08,126
Really, it shows you.

782
01:13:09,323 --> 01:13:13,856
It shows you because you're wealthy
and not something when I first met you.

783
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:15,386
I was unworthy.

784
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:16,526
I was unable to pick up that.

785
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:21,896
You told me there was no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

786
01:13:22,973 --> 01:13:24,636
You made me worry.

787
01:13:26,533 --> 01:13:28,686
So whatever you want to do,
we can do together.

788
01:13:31,823 --> 01:13:32,796
What do you want to do?

789
01:13:35,423 --> 01:13:38,936
Get those children back
to their families and finish that mission.

790
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:41,286
Look at your phone.

791
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:44,326
How do you feel now?

792
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:50,186
There you go should be.

793
01:13:52,063 --> 01:13:52,626
Brushing.

794
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:10,060
Thanks to the talking
about the yeah I'm talking oh

795
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:13,993
do you think those two would ever hold hands
over a half life of pool

796
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,263
and make a doll baby?

797
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:21,346
It's unlikely, sadly
it's too bad.

798
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,086
I think that would
make a great dad.

799
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:27,466
Where?

800
01:15:11,523 --> 01:15:12,046
They're not here.

801
01:15:18,363 --> 01:15:18,896
Right?

802
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:28,720
no

803
01:15:38,883 --> 01:15:39,206
Yeah.

804
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,106
Trust is the key.

805
01:16:40,303 --> 01:16:41,206
about windows

806
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,256
You really have to stop
being like this.

807
01:17:17,793 --> 01:17:19,116
That's when you call the dentist.

808
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:23,286
Tell me where the children are?

809
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:31,796
Oh yeah.

810
01:17:40,103 --> 01:17:40,626
Copy.

811
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:45,856
No, nothing being God.

812
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:52,206
You went to the girls
for help and made him laughing.

813
01:17:53,193 --> 01:17:54,836
You're alive in that set.

814
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:05,040
I say something like you

815
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,950
I'm not a hypocrite
and truly creating

816
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,493
an innocent gods.

817
01:18:14,683 --> 01:18:15,466
And you're not here.

818
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,286
How exciting.

819
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:22,816
Oh gosh, I want you too.

820
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:26,636
This.

821
01:18:29,973 --> 01:18:33,256
Pray for them because
when the women you love.

822
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:38,310
Did you

823
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:39,693
help?

824
01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:42,256
Massive.

825
01:18:52,763 --> 01:18:53,366
Interesting.

826
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:58,026
Yeah.

827
01:19:06,893 --> 01:19:07,616
And I.

828
01:19:10,023 --> 01:19:10,476
I'm sorry.

829
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,430
Just ask the sword
and powered me

830
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,063
the hammer empowered you.

831
01:19:23,453 --> 01:19:25,986
But it did nothing
to change your favorite.

832
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:30,256
The gods will use you.

833
01:19:31,363 --> 01:19:33,586
They will not help you.

834
01:19:34,933 --> 01:19:39,396
No internal war for us.

835
01:19:46,143 --> 01:19:47,226
Shall we go soon?

836
01:19:49,353 --> 01:19:50,176
And you know.

837
01:19:52,113 --> 01:19:52,816
One yes.

838
01:20:04,323 --> 01:20:07,436
I know how bad love
is banned.

839
01:20:13,043 --> 01:20:13,356
Daughter

840
01:20:16,133 --> 01:20:18,806
my face in the high power opinion
would say.

841
01:20:29,323 --> 01:20:32,416
Now I understand I don't understand.

842
01:20:35,353 --> 01:20:37,176
Have to grow up in a while.

843
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:43,700
And they run like wicked

844
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:45,093
call.

845
01:20:51,043 --> 01:20:53,286
Oh yeah.

846
01:21:03,073 --> 01:21:03,816
Oh

847
01:21:05,513 --> 01:21:06,186
yeah.

848
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:43,696
You're OK.

849
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:44,906
Yeah.

850
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:51,526
This guy sure why we
have taken life.

851
01:21:52,403 --> 01:21:53,866
They're only meant
to find their children.

852
01:23:54,973 --> 01:23:56,086
We got everybody here.

853
01:24:19,413 --> 01:24:20,976
Come on, let's go go broken.

854
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,600
Look, there are other more
aggressive forms of treatment we can try,

855
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:26,833
but something's affecting
her body's ability to fight the cancer.

856
01:25:43,613 --> 01:25:44,696
Oh, there you are.

857
01:25:45,303 --> 01:25:48,606
It's going on out there something
more on the fridge without a door.

858
01:25:51,867 --> 01:25:52,400
Goodies.

859
01:25:54,033 --> 01:25:56,467
Oh, she's a lot of pain,
but she is stable.

860
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:57,200
OK, good.

861
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,767
Now you just gotta get this.

862
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,133
It's going to stay there
until the magic potions and elixirs

863
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,200
in that thing so.

864
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:07,033
He's gonna pop
out for a moment.

865
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,133
Pick up the kids, kill the bad guy
and then come straight back.

866
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:12,400
Without me.

867
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:16,067
What happened I doing with any other?

868
01:26:16,867 --> 01:26:18,767
He's gonna use those kids
to distract you.

869
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:19,500
You meet me.

870
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:23,200
I do need you need to relive
the great to everyone

871
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:24,267
in battlefield fighting

872
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:27,200
or side by side with that hammer
is killing you.

873
01:26:28,633 --> 01:26:31,733
Every time you use it,
it's draining all of your mortal strength,

874
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,033
leaving your body unable
to fight the cancer.

875
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,367
Why haven't I was like
there's no tomorrow was

876
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:38,733
before I knew you might don't have one.

877
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,233
Jenny has a chance
and did you have to take it?

878
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,333
Does not have cancer.

879
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:54,233
I know it seems like some cool astrophysicist
from New Mexico just living the dream,

880
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,500
but look at me.

881
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:57,900
I'm gonna keep fighting.

882
01:26:58,067 --> 01:27:01,033
I'm the mighty Thor
and you want me not to do that.

883
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,100
What's the point of more time at this?

884
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:05,667
Because I love you.

885
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:09,800
What was the logic?

886
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,733
And this is a chance for us.

887
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:17,600
If you cut that damn hammer
again and her chances gone.

888
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:30,367
George.

889
01:27:32,733 --> 01:27:36,167
But I'd rather go single day
to stay here so we can try

890
01:27:36,267 --> 01:27:37,400
and figure this out together.

891
01:27:40,733 --> 01:27:42,400
You better come back to me.

892
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:45,000
Soon as I can.

893
01:27:49,133 --> 01:27:49,367
No.

894
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:06,533
Remember that the gauge maternity
is at the literacy center

895
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,367
at the university.

896
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:09,967
The cluster of yes,
I know you know this.

897
01:28:10,033 --> 01:28:10,826
I'm not going to get lost.

898
01:28:11,773 --> 01:28:14,036
So how are you feeling
with the old stab wound?

899
01:28:14,183 --> 01:28:16,256
I think I lost my kidney
gone completely.

900
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,053
Booth, I wish I could join you,

901
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,833
but I'd probably die and that would help
get the kids back

902
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,030
so you have to go in and all you have to do

903
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,783
is destroy that sort of just sort of power.

904
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:27,616
He wants to buy.

905
01:28:27,693 --> 01:28:28,276
Lord that's it.

906
01:28:30,353 --> 01:28:31,906
Hey, don't go away.

907
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:33,036
Yeah.

908
01:29:31,603 --> 01:29:32,506
Finally.

909
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:15,476
Thank you.

910
01:30:18,933 --> 01:30:19,536
Have you come?

911
01:30:35,183 --> 01:30:36,296
Good to see you in person.

912
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:53,833
This is the part you seek out way
towards Stormbreaker being very careful

913
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:54,693
not to bump your head

914
01:30:54,767 --> 01:30:56,400
and you know big shadow monsters.

915
01:30:58,267 --> 01:30:59,100
Every time you have them.

916

Today is the day
that will go down in history.

924
01:31:41,603 --> 01:31:45,696

for generations to come day.

925
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,070

926

01:38:20,253 --> 01:38:20,726
Yes.

949
01:38:51,333 --> 01:38:52,536
Go stop.

950
01:38:57,833 --> 01:38:59,046
Her father wouldn't be.

951
01:39:05,913 --> 01:39:08,016
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

952
01:39:10,623 --> 01:39:13,466
It's not death or revenge
that you seek.

953
01:39:16,563 --> 01:39:17,426
What do I see?

954
01:39:32,363 --> 01:39:33,226
She came up.

955
01:39:36,843 --> 01:39:37,426
Love.

956
01:39:39,233 --> 01:39:43,246
My eyes love you're
going through area which was.

957
01:39:47,733 --> 01:39:50,926
Yeah, you turn your back on me.

958
01:39:52,743 --> 01:39:53,756
Your one goal.

959
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:57,696
I spent my last words with you
when I could be with her.

960
01:39:59,503 --> 01:40:01,846
I choose love you kind
of cheer.

961
01:40:01,923 --> 01:40:03,076
You can bring her back.

962
01:40:07,973 --> 01:40:08,906
Make your wish.

963
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:09,840

964
01:40:34,183 --> 01:40:34,616
Uh.

965
01:40:41,063 --> 01:40:41,496
OK.

966
01:40:46,433 --> 01:40:47,476
She would be a dog.

967
01:40:55,563 --> 01:40:56,696
She won't be alone.

968
01:42:34,633 --> 01:42:35,306
Picked up that.

969
01:42:40,593 --> 01:42:41,546
Then extra life.

970
01:42:43,733 --> 01:42:43,876
Yes.

971
01:42:46,943 --> 01:42:47,346
And you.

972
01:42:51,033 --> 01:42:52,336
Not too bad for you.

973
01:42:58,713 --> 01:43:00,236
I think I figured out
how to make it.

974
01:43:01,633 --> 01:43:02,076
Yeah.

975
01:43:10,563 --> 01:43:11,346
It's the best one yet.

976
01:43:31,683 --> 01:43:32,336
Mind.

977
01:44:56,963 --> 01:45:00,686
Let me tell you the legend
of the Space Viking AKA.

978
01:45:01,593 --> 01:45:06,436
The mighty Thor,
AKA Doctor Jane Foster.

979
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:14,396
This sacrifice save the universe
and taught us all what it means to be worthy.

980
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,870
She helped the children of the ghosts

981
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:20,133
who laser beam their way back home

982
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:24,093
to their dozing little fishing village
turned to his destination.

983
01:45:28,773 --> 01:45:30,996
OK, fine OK you sure OK.

984
01:45:32,533 --> 01:45:33,476
Review the game.

985
01:45:36,673 --> 01:45:40,316
Especially after the king made them
all go to self defence classes.

986
01:45:40,713 --> 01:45:42,676
Look at all those
burning states Vikings.

987
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:49,760
Ethan Hunt, those seven
and some Hunter son

988
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:51,173
who could never do his dance.

989
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:54,100
Freaky Eye magic was becoming
quite the warrior,

990
01:45:54,570 --> 01:45:56,673
the future of Asgard was secure.

991
01:45:58,763 --> 01:45:59,696
Speaking of future.

992
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:03,280
Met

993
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:06,133
with a dude I met
called Dwayne.

994
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,576
What about the what you asked?

995
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,870
He embarked on a new journey

996
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,650
because he had found something to live for,

997
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,690
something to live for,

998
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:20,983
a little someone who turned him
from sad God into Dad.

999
01:46:21,093 --> 01:46:22,736
God breakfast is served.

1000
01:46:24,403 --> 01:46:27,506
Hello there you go,
hey breakfast.

1001
01:46:28,863 --> 01:46:29,276
Excuse.

01:46:30,643 --> 01:46:31,586
What's that?

1003
01:46:31,703 --> 01:46:32,506
They're their pants.

1004
01:46:32,903 --> 01:46:34,516
Come on,
I don't think I like.

1005
01:46:36,693 --> 01:46:37,376
Yes, you do.

1006
01:46:37,493 --> 01:46:39,756
No, I have that in my life
we have to go.

1007
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:41,476
We're gonna be like
where are your boots?

1008
01:46:43,883 --> 01:46:44,766
You know what it is?

1009
01:46:46,363 --> 01:46:46,966
No you don't.

1010
01:46:48,323 --> 01:46:49,616
No, you're not.

1011
01:46:54,063 --> 01:46:55,266
Brand new now destroyed.

1012
01:46:55,343 --> 01:46:56,846
Thank you very much.

1013
01:46:56,983 --> 01:46:58,786
You know you well what you want.

1014
01:46:58,943 --> 01:47:00,906
Don't come complaining
to me when your feet get sore, right?

1015
01:47:00,983 --> 01:47:02,506
You get no sympathy here from me.

1016
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:05,110
Boots

1017
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:07,843
remember what my mother
used to tell me.

1018
01:47:08,233 --> 01:47:11,946
There's no Grown Ups and you see anyone scared
or be picked on the God.

1019
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:14,390
OK, most of all have fun,

1020
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:15,863
gotcha.

1021
01:47:18,523 --> 01:47:20,756
Over there sleeping in the bed.

1022
01:47:22,823 --> 01:47:23,646
Oh wow.

1023
01:47:26,043 --> 01:47:27,606
That is not coming off.

1024
01:47:28,533 --> 01:47:29,867
What did you do?

1025
01:47:31,067 --> 01:47:31,600
They're far.

1026
01:47:33,967 --> 01:47:34,767
Suppose you did it.

1027
01:47:34,867 --> 01:47:35,467
I love it.

1028
01:47:36,167 --> 01:47:37,067
Very creative.

1029
01:47:43,167 --> 01:47:45,300
I see the aliens
down there distracting once.

1030
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:47,800
Yeah, nice, that's

1031
01:47:48,733 --> 01:47:49,067

1032
01:47:52,067 --> 01:47:52,867
I love you sweetie.

1033
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:57,700
Who?

1034
01:48:00,367 --> 01:48:04,167
This girl born from maternity
with the pounds of a God.

1035
01:48:07,033 --> 01:48:11,567
Two warriors fighting the good fight
for those who can't farm.

1036
01:48:17,933 --> 01:48:20,467
75 and have been given
many more.

1037
01:48:24,867 --> 01:48:25,233
Sophie.

1038
01:48:33,367 --> 01:48:34,733
Poop, poop, poop.

1039
01:49:32,803 --> 01:49:33,326
Who?

1040
01:50:16,023 --> 01:50:18,116
Choose to be that being a God.

1041
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:22,250
People

1042
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:24,313
who.

1043
01:50:26,523 --> 01:50:27,836
Hopes and dreams.
