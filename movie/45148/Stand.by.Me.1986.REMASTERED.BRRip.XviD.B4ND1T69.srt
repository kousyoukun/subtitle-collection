00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,936
they'll know we didn't go
to the drag races. We'll get hided.

158
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,558
Nobody will care

159
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:49,391
because everybody's gonna be
So jazzed about what we found,

160
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,941
- it's not gonna make a difference.
- CHRIS: Yeah.

161
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:53,770
My dad will hide me anyway,
but hell, it's worth a hiding.

162
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,775
- TEDDY: Shit, yeah.
- Let's do it. What do you say?

163
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,152
- All right.
- Gordie?

164
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,278
Sure.

165
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,450
Vern?

166
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,993
I don't know.

167
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:02,616
Vern.

168
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,822
Come on, Verno.

169
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,240
Vern.

170
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,993
- Vern. Come on, Verno.
- Come on, Verno.

171
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,544
- Okay.
- CHRIS: Al right.

172
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,295
All right! Too cool, too cool!
Very cool! Very, very cool! Yes!

173
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:17,594
GORDIE: 1 wanted to share
my friends' enthusiasm, but I couldn't.

174
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,591
That summer at home,
I had become the Invisible Boy.

175
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,478
GORDIE: Mom,
do you know where my canteen is?

176
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,937
Mom?

177
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,109
It's in Denny's room.

178
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,278
Oh.

179
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,363
GORDIE: In April,
my older brother, Dennis,

180
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,286
had been killed in a jeep accident.

181
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,113
Four months had passed,

182
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:49,622
but my parents still hadn't been able
to put the pieces back together again.

183
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,369
DENNY: Hey, Gordie,
I got something for you.

184
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,836
This, my friend, is for you.

185
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,711
But, Denny, this is your Yankee cap.

186
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:40,385
No. No, no. This is your Yankee cap.
It's a good luck cap.

187
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:42,178
You wear that cap, you know
how many fish we're gonna catch?

188
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,675
- How much?
- A bazillion.

189
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:47,430
A bazillion fish. And it looks good
on you, too. Just like that.

190
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,885
Hey, Moe, I'm going blind.

191
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:52,313
Don't start with me, porcupine.
Come here, give me a hug.

192
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,270
MR. LACHANCE: You found it.

193
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:56,559
Huh?

194
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,320
You found it.

195
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:01,272
Yeah.

196
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:10,324
Why can't you have friends like Denny's?

197
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,162
Dad, they're okay.

198
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,748
Sure, they are. A thief and two feebs.

199
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:16,833
Chris isn't a thief.

200
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,128
He stole the milk money at school.

201
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,293
He's a thief in my book.

202
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:40,979
GORDIE: It was almost noon
as we set out to find

203
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,280
the body of a dead kid named Ray Brower.

204
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,492
CHRIS: Right here's cool.

205
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,074
Hey, Chris.

206
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,331
- Thanks a lot.
- MAN: Sure thing.

207
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,874
- Gordo.
- Hey, man.

208
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,541
- You want to see something?
- Sure. What?

209
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:59,334
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

210
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,007
- Come on, man.
- What is it?

211
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:04,344
- CHRIS: Man, you've got to see this.
- Come on, man. What is it?

212
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:09,261
Come on, what is it?

213
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:17,394
You want to be the Lone Ranger
or the Cisco Kid?

214
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,064
(WHISPERS) Walking, talking Jesus!

215
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:24,231
- Where'd you get this?
- Hocked it from my old man's bureau.

216
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:25,864
It's a .45.

217
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,237
I can see that.

218
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,445
(MIMICKING GUNSHOT)

219
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,740
- You got shells for it?
- Yeah.

220
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,666
I took all that was left in the box.

221
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:37,790
My dad'll think
that he used them himself

222
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,666
shooting at beer cans
while he was drunk.

223
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,963
- Is it loaded?
- Hell, no. What do you think I am?

224
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:45,088
(GUN COCKS)

225
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,216
BOTH: Jesus!

226
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,388
- Let's get out of here! Come on!
- (LAUGHING)

227
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:54,345
Gordie did it! Gordie Lachance
is shooting up Castle Rock!

228
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:55,519
GORDIE: Shut up!

229
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:58,940
Hey, who did that?
Who's letting cherry bombs off out here?

230
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:04,480
Oh, man, you should have seen your face.
Damn, that was cool!

231
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:07,611
- That was really fine.
- You knew it was loaded, you wet end!

232
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,318
I'm gonna be in trouble now.
That Tupper babe saw me.

233
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:11,652
Shit, Gordie,
she thought it was firecrackers.

234
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,909
I don't care.
That was a mean trick, Chris.

235
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,205
Hey, Gordie...

236
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:18,455
I didn't know it was loaded.

237
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,120
- Honest.
- You swear?

238
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,463
Yeah, I swear.

239
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:26,213
- On your mother's name?
- Yeah.

240
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:28,385
Even if she goes to hell
"cause you lied?

241
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:29,962
Yeah, I swear.

242

Pinkie swear?

243
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,223
Pinkie swear.

244
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,144
Hey, girls, where you going?

245
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,479
Hey, come on, man.
My brother gave me that!

246
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:47,939
And now you're giving it to me.

247
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,822
Give it to me!
Come on, man, that's mine!

248
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,787
You're a real asshole, you know that?

249
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,451
Oh.

250
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,497
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball.

251
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:01,953
Now, Christopher,

252
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,922
I know you didn't mean
to insult my friend.

253
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,417
I know he didn't mean to insult me.

254
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:11,926
That's why I'm gonna give him
the opportunity of taking it back.

255
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,843
- Oh, shit.
- Take it back, kid.

256
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,853
Come on, man, stop it,
you're hurting him.

257
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,270
You bastard! Let go, man.

258
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,689
- GORDIE: Stop it, man! Cut it out!
- Take it back, kid.

259
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,976
GORDIE: Cut it out!
ACE: Take it back.

260
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,358
You big... Okay, okay, I take it back.
I take it back.

261
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,072
There.

262
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,870
Now I feel a whole lot better
about this.

263
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,368
How about you?

264
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,747
Good.

265
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,373
See you later, girls.

Come on, just forget them.

VERN: What do we need
a pistol for, anyway?

268
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:19,155
It's spooky sleeping out at night
in the woods. You might see a bear.

269
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,910
Or a garbage can.

(ALL LAUGH)

271
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,162
I brought a comb.

272
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,997
What do we need a comb for?

273
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:30,459
Well, if we get on TV
we want to look good, don't we?

274
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:32,634
- That's a lot of thinking, Vern.
- VERN: Thanks.

it's gonna be?

(SIGHS) If we follow the tracks
all the way into Harlow,

279
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:47,433
it'll be about 20 miles.

280
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,189
Sound about right to you, Gordie?

281
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,441
Yeah, it might even be 30.

282
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,982
Gee, maybe we should just hitchhike.

283
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,361
- No way, that sucks.
- Why not?

284
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,908
We could go out to Route Seven
to the Shiloh Church,

285
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,537
then down the Back Harlow Road.
We'll be there by sundown.

286
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:04,662
TEDDY: That's pussy.

287
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,669

any kids that lived?

- If Chopper's there we'll send you in.

Who's got the food?

Not me. Gordie?

300
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:05,011
Oh! This is great. What are we
supposed to do? Eat our feet?

301
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,305
You mean,
you didn't bring anything, either?

302

Shit. This wasn't my idea.
It was Vern's idea.

Why didn't you bring something?

Think of everything? I brought the comb.

Oh, great, you brought the comb.

What do you need a comb for?
You don't even have any hair.

I brought it for you guys,
when we get there.

00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:19,847
Don't call me any
of your mother's pet names.

470
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,178
What a wet end you are, Lachance.

471
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,350
Shut up.

472
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:24,801
I don't shut up...

473
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,558

And when I look at you, I throw up.

GORDIE: Finding new and preferably
disgusting ways

478
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:40,526
to degrade a friend's mother
was always held in high regard.

479
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:55,715
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?

480
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,051
Yes, sir.

481
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,380
Shame what happened to him.

482
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:05,718
The Bible says,
"In the midst of life we are in death."

483
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:07,556
Did you know that?

484
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,223
I lost a brother in Korea.

485
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:15,310
You look like your brother Denny.

486
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:17,112
People ever tell you that?

487
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,064
Sometimes.

488
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:24,782
I remember the year
he was All-Conference.

489
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,742
Quarterback, he played.

490

492
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,798

at the game tomorrow.

495

MRS. LACHANCE: Are you going
to see Jane after the game?

496
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,014
I think she's a lovely girl.

497
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:50,015
GORDIE: Dad,
may I please have the potatoes?

498
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:52,564
Dorothy, don't talk to the boy
about girls.

499
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,440
He shouldn't be thinking about girls.
This is the biggest game of his life.

500
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,271
Dennis, when you're
out there tomorrow...

501
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:00,856
Pop, did you read
the story that Gordie wrote?

502
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,445
Gordie wrote a story.

503
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:03,650
It was really good.

504
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:05,406
MRS. LACHANCE.
What did you write, sweetheart?

505
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,331
Now, see, that's what I'm talking about.
Football takes concentration.

506
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:12,705
You start in on the girls
and his mind's all over the place.

507
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:14,207
Gordie, I really liked it.

508
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:16,163
I thought it was great.

509
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:17,247
MR. LACHANCE.
I don't want you interrupting me.

510
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,334
Now, you see I'm talking to the boy,
don't you?

Hmm?

513

Do you play football?

514
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:30,310
No.

515
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:32,350
What do you do?

516
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:36,141
I don't know.

517
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:39,478
Yeah, well, your brother, Denny,
sure could play football.

in the vast difference
between myth and reality.

I know who you are.
You're Teddy Duchamp.

541
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,803
Your dad's a loony.

542
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,302
A loony up in the nuthouse at Togus.

He took your ear and he put it
to a stove and he burned it off.

He's crazier than a shithouse rat.

- Nobody ranks out my old man.
- MILO: Come back here.

He ranked my old man. (SOBBING)

572
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:55,598
GORDIE: I wondered
how Teddy could care so much

573
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:57,392
for his dad who'd practically killed him

574
00:29:57,478 --> 00:29:59,469
and I couldn't give a shit
about my own dad

575
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,805
who hadn't laid a hand on me
since I was three.

576
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,891
And that was for eating bleach
under the sink.

577
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,942
He ranked my old man.

578
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:10,193
What do you care what a fat old pile
of shit like him says about your dad?

579
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:13,025
He still stormed the beach
at Normandy, right?

580
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,200
Yeah, forget it.

581

Forget it, all right?

583

He don't know nothing
about your old man. He's just dog shit.

Whatever's between you and your old man,
he can't change that.

00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,490
We interrupt to bring you an update

623
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:28,247
on the search for the missing
12-year-old Ray Brower.

624
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:30,829
The police have expanded their efforts
to include Motton,

625
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:32,755

EYEBALL: Shit,
when are they gonna give up?

627
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,676
The kid's gone.
They're never gonna find him.

628
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:38,925
- Not where they're looking.
- BILLY: Hey.

629
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,256
Eyeball's right, Charlie,
they ain't never gonna find him.

630
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,513
Would you hold still?
You're making me fuck up the snake part.

631
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,012
I'll tell you how
they're gonna find him.

632
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:50,815
Ten years from now, some hunter's
gonna go in the woods to take a leak,

633
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,109
wind up pissing on his bones.

634
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:55,528
I bet you a thousand bucks
they find him before that.

635
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,526
Bet you $2,000 they don't.

636
00:32:57,617 --> 00:33:00,405
- Well, asshole...
- BILLY: Hey, what's the big deal?

637
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:03,578
- Who cares?
- Would you two just shut the fuck up?

638

If either one of you assholes
had $2,000, I'd kill you both.

Yeah, but so what? Everybody's weird.

By next June we'll all be split up.

What are you talking about?
Why would that happen?

Smart guys.

671
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:50,977
- Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean.
- No, man.

672

Don't say that. Don't even think that.

I'm not going in
with a lot of pussies, forget it.

Well, then you're an asshole.

675

What's asshole about wanting
to be with your friends?

676
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:01,487
It's asshole if your friends
drag you down.

You hang with us, you'll just be

You think Mighty Mouse could
beat up Superman?

- What are you, cracked?
- Why not?

680
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:13,830
I saw the other day, he was carrying
five elephants in one hand.

681

Boy, you don't know nothing.

682
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,837
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.

683
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:19,380
Superman is a real guy.

684
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,959
No way a cartoon
could beat up a real guy.

685
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:25,087
Yeah, maybe you're right.

a real writer someday, Gordie.

Fuck writing!
I don't want to be a writer.

689

It's stupid.
It's a stupid waste of time.

That's your dad talking.

- Bull-true!

I know how your dad feels about you.
He doesn't give a shit about you.

693
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:47,693
Denny was the one he cared about,
and don't try to tell me different.

694

You're just a kid, Gordie.

Oh, gee. Thanks, Dad.

696

for you, kid. Try not to lose it."

702

But kids lose everything unless there's
someone there to look out for them.

I'm not up for that, man.

about Sergeant Steele

and his battling leathernecks?

792

Well, the one I've been thinking about
is kind of different.

It's about this pie-eating contest.

00:42:57,049 --> 00:43:00,132
The main guy of the story
is this fat kid that nobody likes,

795
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:01,425
named Davie Hogan.

796
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,425

00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:13,438
Well, this kid, he's our age,
but he's fat. Real fat.

800
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:18,018
He weighs close to 180, but you know,
it's not his fault. It's his glands.

801
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:20,695
Oh, yeah, my cousin's like that.
Sincerely.

802
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:22,484
She weighs over 300 pounds.

803
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:25,316
Supposed to be a "hyboid" gland
or something.

804
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:28,494
I don't know about any "hyboid" gland,
but what a blimp!

805
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,413
No shit.
She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.

806

- And, you know, this one time...
- Will you shut up, Vern?

Yeah. Yeah, right.
Go on, Gordie. It's a swell story.

808
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:40,502
Well, all the kids,
instead of calling him Davie,

809
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:43,380
they call him Lardass. Lardass Hogan.

810
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,383
Even his little brother
and sister call him Lardass.

811
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:50,592
At school they put this sticker
on his back that says, "Wide Load."

812
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:54,429
And they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance.

813
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:56,730
But one day he gets an idea.

a kid ever had.

01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,646
- We'll take the right.
- All right.

1240
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:40,329
VERN: There he is! I see him! Look!

1241
01:10:40,419 --> 01:10:42,581
Look over there! I see him! I see him!

1242
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:47,499
GORDIE: None of us could breathe.

1243
01:10:48,093 --> 01:10:51,381
Somewhere under those bushes
was the rest of Ray Brower.

1244
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,484
The train had knocked Ray Brower
out of his Keds,

1245
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:09,483
Just like it had knocked the life
out of his body.

1246
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:10,608
Jesus.

1247
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,404
GORDIE: The kid wasn't sick.

1248
01:11:14,995 --> 01:11:16,702
The kid wasn't sleeping.

1249
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:19,075
The kid was dead.

1250
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:36,930
CHRIS: Let's look
for some long branches.

1251
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:38,257
We'll build him a stretcher.

1252
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:52,654
Gordie?

1253
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:03,082
Why did you have to die?

1254
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:05,663
VERN: What's the matter with Gordie?

1255
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:06,994
CHRIS: Nothing.

1256
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,831
Why don't you guys just go over there
and look for some branches, okay?

1257
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:10,960
Okay.

1258
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:24,846
Why did he have to die, Chris?

1259
01:12:25,691 --> 01:12:29,685
Why did Denny have to die? Why?

1260
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:32,478
I don't know.

1261
01:12:34,241 --> 01:12:36,573
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that.

1262
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,322
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that, man.

1263
01:12:40,873 --> 01:12:44,582
I'm no good.
My dad said it. I'm no good.

1264
01:12:44,668 --> 01:12:46,250
He doesn't know you.

1265
01:12:46,879 --> 01:12:48,745
(BREATH TREMBLING) He hates me.

1266
01:12:48,839 --> 01:12:50,329
He doesn't hate you.

1267
01:12:51,216 --> 01:12:53,173
- (CRYING) He hates me.
- No.

1268
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,001
He just doesn't know you.

1269
01:12:55,179 --> 01:12:58,092
He hates me. My dad hates me.

1270
01:12:58,182 --> 01:12:59,343
(SOBBING)

1271
01:12:59,433 --> 01:13:02,425
He hates me. Oh, God.

1272
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:28,872
You're gonna be
a great writer someday, Gordie.

1273
01:13:30,422 --> 01:13:34,757
You might even write about us guys,
if you ever get hard up for material.

1274
01:13:38,722 --> 01:13:40,383
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

1275
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,516
(SNIFFLES)

1276
01:13:52,903 --> 01:13:56,567
I guess I'd have to be
pretty hard up, huh?

1277
01:13:58,158 --> 01:13:59,569
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

1278
01:14:02,746 --> 01:14:04,862
ACE: What the fuck
do you know about this?

1279
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,624
Son of a bitch! My little brother.

1280
01:14:11,463 --> 01:14:15,001
You wasn't planning on taking
the body from us, was you, boys?

1281
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,216
CHRIS: You get away, man.

1282
01:14:18,345 --> 01:14:20,177
We found him. We got dibs.

1283
01:14:20,514 --> 01:14:24,553
Aw, we better start running, Eyeball.
They got dibs.

1284
01:14:24,685 --> 01:14:26,926
We earned him, man.
You guys came in a car.

1285
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,602
That's not fair. He's ours.

1286
01:14:28,689 --> 01:14:30,851
"That's not fair. He's ours."

1287
01:14:31,108 --> 01:14:32,644
Well, not anymore.

1288
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:36,147
There are four of us, Eyeball.
You just make your move.

1289
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,104
Oh, we will. Don't you worry.

1290
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,949
Vern, you little son of a whore.

1291
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,327
- You was under the porch.
- No. No, I swear it wasn't me.

1292
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,954
You little keyhole-peeping bung.

1293
01:14:51,044 --> 01:14:52,580
I ought to beat
the living shit out of you.

1294
01:14:53,297 --> 01:14:54,332
(SNAPS FINGERS)

1295
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:01,422
You guys have two choices.

1296
01:15:02,723 --> 01:15:05,306
You either leave quietly
and we take the body

1297
01:15:05,809 --> 01:15:08,676
or you stay
and we beat the shit out of you.

1298
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,686
And we take the body.

1299
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:12,763
Besides, me and Billy found him first.

1300
01:15:12,858 --> 01:15:14,724
Yeah, Vern told us how you found him.

1301
01:15:14,818 --> 01:15:18,231
(MOCKINGLY) "Oh, Billy,
I wish we'd never boosted that car."

1302
01:15:18,322 --> 01:15:20,438
"Oh, Billy, I think I just turned

"my Fruit of the Looms
into a fudge factory."

1304
01:15:22,326 --> 01:15:24,818
- That's it. Your ass is grass!
- Hold it.

1305
01:15:28,332 --> 01:15:30,494
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot.

1306
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:32,200
This is your last chance.

1307
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:35,161
What do you say, kid?

1308
01:15:36,548 --> 01:15:39,666
Why don't you go home
and fuck your mother some more?

1309
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:42,254
(SIGHS)

1310
01:15:44,348 --> 01:15:45,554
You're dead.

1311
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:48,216
Come on, Chris, let's split.

1312
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,972
CHRIS: They're not taking him.
TEDDY: Come on, man, this is crazy.

1313
01:15:51,063 --> 01:15:53,521
- They're not taking him.
- He's got a knife, man.

1314
01:15:54,232 --> 01:15:56,018
Ace, come on, man.

1315
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:02,939
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

1316
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,440
No problem.

1317
01:16:04,534 --> 01:16:05,649
(GUN FIRES)

1318
01:16:18,256 --> 01:16:21,749
You're not taking him.
Nobody's taking him.

1319
01:16:23,595 --> 01:16:27,213
Come on, kid, just give me the gun
before you take your foot off.

1320
01:16:28,642 --> 01:16:31,259
You ain't got the sack
to shoot a woodchuck.

1321
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:33,844
Don't move, Ace.

1322
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:37,890
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

1323
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:42,482
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.

1324
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:47,942
You must have at least some
of your brother's good sense.

1325

(COCKS GUN)

1326
01:16:52,249 --> 01:16:56,834
Suck my fat one,
you cheap dime-store hood.

1327
01:17:03,677 --> 01:17:05,543
What are you going to do, shoot us all?

1328
01:17:06,346 --> 01:17:08,929
No, Ace, just you.

1329
01:17:19,443 --> 01:17:21,400
We're gonna get you for this.

1330
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:24,027
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

1331
01:17:24,614 --> 01:17:25,900
Oh, we will.

1332
01:17:38,628 --> 01:17:42,087
We're not gonna forget this,
if that's what you're thinking.

1333
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:44,631
This is big time, baby.

1334
01:18:01,735 --> 01:18:03,396
"Suck my fat one?"

1335
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:07,529
Whoever told you
you had a fat one, Lachance?

1336
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:11,066
Biggest one in four counties.

1337
01:18:11,703 --> 01:18:13,159
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

1338
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:30,962
Are we gonna take him?

1339
01:18:31,389 --> 01:18:32,470
No.

1340
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,183
But we came all this way.

1341
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:38,852
We were supposed to be heroes.

1342
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:42,477
Not this way, Teddy.

1343
01:18:45,862 --> 01:18:47,773
Chris, give me a hand.

1344
01:18:50,534 --> 01:18:52,775
GORDIE: Ray Brower's body was found,

1345
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:55,987
but neither our gang
nor their gang got the credit.

1346
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,495
In the end, we decided

1347
01:18:57,582 --> 01:19:00,665
that an anonymous phone call
was the best thing to do.

1348
01:19:06,758 --> 01:19:08,089
We headed home.

1349
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,964
And although many thoughts
raced through our minds,

1350
01:19:11,054 --> 01:19:12,715
we barely spoke.

1351
01:19:16,434 --> 01:19:19,643
We walked through the night
and made it back to Castle Rock

1352
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:22,721
a little past five o'clock
on Sunday morning,

the day before Labor Day.

1354
01:19:25,402 --> 01:19:29,737
We'd only been gone two days
but somehow the town seemed different.

01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,696
Smaller.

1356
01:19:48,758 --> 01:19:49,998
Well...

1357
01:19:50,427 --> 01:19:51,792
See you in school.

1358
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:55,796
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1359
01:19:55,932 --> 01:19:57,639
See you in junior high.

Well, guys, I better get home

1363
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:25,625
before my mom puts me
on the Ten Most Wanted list.

1364
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:35,461
Hey, Chris?

1365
01:20:36,806 --> 01:20:38,467
No hard feelings, okay?

1366
01:20:39,392 --> 01:20:40,632
No way, man.

1367
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:49,016
(SINGING) Gun, will travel
Reads the card of a man

1368
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:54,108
A knight without armor
In a savage land

1369

His fast gun for hire
Heeds the calling wind

1370
01:21:05,168 --> 01:21:08,456
GORDIE: As time went on, we saw less
and less of Teddy and Vern

1371
01:21:09,047 --> 01:21:12,790
until eventually they became
Just two more faces in the halls.

1372
01:21:12,926 --> 01:21:14,508
It happens sometimes.

1373
01:21:14,678 --> 01:21:18,171
Friends come in and out of your life
like busboys in a restaurant.

1374
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:22,679
I heard that Vern got married
out of high school, had four kids,

1375
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:26,429
and is now the forklift operator
at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.

1376
01:21:26,523 --> 01:21:29,140
Teddy tried several times
to get into the army,

1377
01:21:29,234 --> 01:21:30,941
but his eyes and his ear kept him out.

1378
01:21:31,027 --> 01:21:33,314
Last I'd heard,
he'd spent some time in jail

1379
01:21:33,405 --> 01:21:36,272
and was now doing odd jobs
around Castle Rock.

1380
01:21:44,749 --> 01:21:47,741
I'm never gonna get out
of this town, am I, Gordie?

1381
01:21:49,462 --> 01:21:51,624
You can do anything you want, man.

1382
01:21:53,466 --> 01:21:55,878
Yeah, sure.

1383
01:22:04,477 --> 01:22:05,842
Give me some skin.

1384
01:22:15,155 --> 01:22:16,737
I'll see you.

1385
01:22:16,823 --> 01:22:18,530
Not if I see you first.

1386
01:22:23,496 --> 01:22:24,907
GORDIE: Chris did get out.

1387
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:27,288
He enrolled
in the college courses with me.

1388
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,913
And although it was hard,
he gutted it out like he always did.

1389
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:34,084
He went on to college
and eventually became a lawyer.

1390
01:22:34,841 --> 01:22:37,549
Last week, he entered
a fast-food restaurant.

1391
01:22:37,927 --> 01:22:40,794
Just ahead of him,
two men got into an argument.

1392
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:42,721
One of them pulled a knife.

1393
01:22:42,807 --> 01:22:45,048
Chris, who had always made
the best peace,

1394
01:22:45,143 --> 01:22:46,178
tried to break it up.

1395
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,723
He was stabbed in the throat.

1396
01:22:48,813 --> 01:22:50,929
He died almost instantly.

1397
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:10,998
(DOOR OPENS)

1398
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,993
Dad, can we go now?

1399
01:23:13,713 --> 01:23:17,126
- You ready?
- Yeah, we've been ready for an hour.

1400
01:23:18,885 --> 01:23:20,341
(LAUGHS)

1401
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,010
Okay, I'll be right there.

1402
01:23:22,222 --> 01:23:24,054
He said that a half hour ago.

1403
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,223
GORDIE'S SON: Yeah, my dad's weird.
He gets like that when he's writing.

1404
01:23:32,732 --> 01:23:33,767
(CHUCKLES)

1405
01:24:13,857 --> 01:24:17,851
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1406
01:24:28,788 --> 01:24:32,201
When the night has come

1407
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:36,459
And the land is dark

1408
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,125
And the moon is the only light we'll see

1409
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:48,130
No, I won't be afraid

1410
01:24:48,224 --> 01:24:52,263
Oh, I won't be afraid

1411
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:56,438
Just as long as you stand

1412
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,811
Stand by me

1413
01:24:58,902 --> 01:25:03,863
So darlin', darlin', stand by me

1414
01:25:03,948 --> 01:25:08,192
Oh, stand by me

1415
01:25:08,661 --> 01:25:10,743
Oh, stand

1416
01:25:11,748 --> 01:25:15,787
Stand by me, stand by me

1417
01:25:16,628 --> 01:25:20,496
If the sky that we look upon

1418
01:25:21,925 --> 01:25:24,542
Should tumble and fall

1419
01:25:24,636 --> 01:25:30,131
Or the mountains should crumble
To the sea

1420
01:25:32,602 --> 01:25:36,061
I won't cry, I won't cry

1421
01:25:36,147 --> 01:25:40,141
No, I won't shed a tear

1422
01:25:40,652 --> 01:25:44,361
Just as long as you stand

1423
01:25:44,447 --> 01:25:46,438
Stand by me

1424
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:51,785
And darlin', darlin', stand by me

1425
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,074
Oh, stand by me

1426
01:25:56,542 --> 01:25:58,658
Whoa, stand now

1427
01:25:59,712 --> 01:26:03,376
Stand by me, stand by me

1428
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:39,830
Darlin', darlin', stand by me

1429
01:26:39,919 --> 01:26:43,913
Oh, stand by me

1430
01:26:44,382 --> 01:26:46,623
Oh, stand

1431
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:51,421
Stand by me, stand by me

1432
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:56,342
If the sky that we look upon

1433
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,932
Should tumble and fall

1434
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:05,976
Or the mountains should crumble
To the sea

1435
01:27:08,364 --> 01:27:11,732
I won't cry, I won't cry

1436
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:16,161
No, I won't shed a tear

1437
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:20,199
Just as long as you stand

1438
01:27:20,293 --> 01:27:21,909
Stand by me

1439
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:27,798
And darlin', darlin', stand by me

1440
01:27:27,884 --> 01:27:31,798
Oh, stand by me

1441
01:27:32,263 --> 01:27:34,345
Whoa, stand now

1442
01:27:35,433 --> 01:27:39,097
Stand by me, stand by me

1443
01:28:11,094 --> 01:28:15,679
Darlin', darlin', stand by me

1444
01:28:15,765 --> 01:28:19,679
Oh, stand by me

1445
01:28:20,269 --> 01:28:22,135
Oh, stand

1446
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:26,314
Stand by me, stand by me
