00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:07,377
“克利斯多佛詹伯斯律师 在餐厅劝架不成反遭杀害”

2
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:36,447
我第一次见到死尸 是在刚过我1 2岁后不久
I was 12 going on 13 the first time I saw a dead human being.

3
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,190
“警方案例” 事情发生于1 9 5 9年的夏季
It happened in the summer of 1959...

4
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,156
那是好久以前了
...a long time ago...

5
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,058
但对我而言却恍如昨日
...but only if you measure it in terms of years.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,959
那时我家住在奥勒冈州 一个叫岩堡的小镇
I was living in a small town in Oregon called Castle Rock.

7
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:59,737
镇上只有一千两百余居民 但对我而言那已是整个世界
There were only 1,281 people, but to me it was the whole world.

8
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:03,506
各位，又到了鲍伯克米尔时间 今天早晨波特兰阳光普照
It's the Bossman Bob Cormier. It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland.

9
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,570
气温是华氏9 0度而且还在上升
It's 90 KLAM degrees and getting hotter.

10
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:08,981
首先为您播一首鲍比戴的 摇滚乐，很棒的曲子
Up the Iadder with another platter. It's Bobby Day with Rockin' Robin...

11
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,986
酷毙了
...it's boss.

12
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:31,433
猜个谜，你如何看出 邻居是法国人？
How do you know a Frenchman's been in your backyard?

13
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,999
简单，因为自己是法国人
I'm French, okay.

14
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:35,910
答案是你家垃圾桶被掏空 而狗被搞大了肚子
Your garbage cans are empty and your dog's pregnant.

15
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,381
还是我的答案比较好
Didn't I just say I was French?

16
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:39,972
看牌
I knock.

17
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,642
可恶
Shit.

18
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,948
2 9点
Twenty nine.

19
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,286
2 2点 又完蛋了
Twenty two. Piss up a rope.

20
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:52,060
戈帝又完了 戈帝又被扫地出门了
Gordie's out, Ol' Gordie just bit the bag and stepped out the door.

21
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,490
得了，老兄
Come on, man, deal.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,867
泰迪杜强是我们这伙儿人里 最神经的家伙
Teddy Duchamp was the craziest guy we hung around with.

23
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,065
他命不太好
He didn't have much of a chance in life.

24
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,438
老爸喜怒无常，脾气暴燥
His dad was given to fits of rage.

25
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,739
有一次他把泰迪的耳朵 扯到火炉边
One time he held Teddy's ear to a stove

26
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,904
几乎烤熟了
and almost burned it off.

27
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,607
看牌
I knock.

28
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:12,045
你这个四眼狗屎
You four eyed pile of shit.

29
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:14,712
狗屎何止四眼， 千眼都不只
The "pile of shit" has 1,000 eyes.

30
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,011
干嘛？
What?

31
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:20,524
有什么好笑？ 我3 0点，你呢？
What's so funny? I got thirty, what have you got?

32
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:23,586
1 6点
Sixteen.

33
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,358
再笑啊，笑死活该
Go ahead, keep Iaughing.

34
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:26,261
你也是我的手下败将
You're down to your ride, pal.

35
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,451
克利斯詹伯斯是我们的帮主 也是我最好的朋友
Chris Chambers was the Ieader of our gang and my best friend.

36
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:33,269
他的家庭不大幸福 大家都认定他以后会是个恶棍
He came from a bad family and everyonejust knew he'd turn out bad.

37
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,501
克利斯自己也有同感
Including Chris.

38
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:38,237
那不是我们的敲门暗号
That's not the secret knock.

39
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:40,507
我把敲门暗号给忘了 快让我进来
I forgot the secret knock. Let me in.

40
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,275
维恩
Vern.

41
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,715
好了，你们这些家伙快开门
Come on, you guys, open up.

42
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,016
听着，你们绝对不会相信
Man, you guys are not going to believe this.

43
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:48,520
这是个天大的消息
This is so boss.

44
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,220
你们听了就知道
Wait till you hear this.

45
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:54,284
你们绝不会相信 这事令人难以置信
You won't believe it. It's unbelievable.

46
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,862
先让我喘口气 我从家里一直跑到这儿
Let me catch my breath. I ran all the way from my house.

47
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:01,900
我跑一路跑到家
"I ran all the way home"

48
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,596
少来了，你们 听我说，真是个大消息
Come on. Listen to me, this is boss.

49
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,400
只为了向你说声抱歉
"Just to say I'm sorry"

50
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:08,602
算了'不想听就算了
Okay, forget it. I don't have to tell you nothin'.

51
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,906
兄弟们，别唱了 究竟是什么大消息？
Hold on, you guys. Hold on. What is it, man?

52
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:13,243
保证轰动，你们绝不敢相信 不盖你们
Great, you won't believe this, sincerely.

53
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:15,249
我一路跑到家
"l ran all the way home"

54
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:16,750
你们这些浑球
Screw you guys. Forget it.

55
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:18,810
不想听算了 究竟是什么事？
What is it?

56
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,980
你们今晚可不可以在外过夜？
Can you camp out tonight?

57
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:23,616
我是说如果告诉你们老爸 今晚要在我家露营？
I mean, if you tell your folks we're gonna tent out in my backfield?

58
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,717
我想应该没问题
I think so.

59
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:29,287
只是我爸最近脾气不太好 他最近喝酒喝的很凶
Except my dad's kind of on a mean streak. He's been drinking a lot Iately.

60
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:32,026
你一定要想法出来 你绝不敢相信这件事
You got to. Sincerely, you won't believe this. Can you, Gordie?

61
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,227
你呢，戈帝？ 大概可以吧
Yeah, probably.

62
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:36,636
什么事大不了的事让你像屁股 着火似的紧张，维恩？
So what are you pissing and moaning about Vern O?

63
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:37,968
看牌
I knock.  What?

64
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,067
少来，你又没有王牌
You liar! You ain't got no pat hand.

65
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:43,408
你才没有王牌
You didn't deal yourself no pat hand.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,176
别不认帐，屎蛋
Make your draw, shitheap.

67
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:49,243
你们想不想看死人？
You guys want to go see a dead body?

68
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:55,181
我是在地板下挖宝的时候 听到这件事的，明白吗？
I was under the porch digging, you know?

69
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,692
我们立刻明白了维恩的意思
We all understood what Vern meant right away.

70
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:00,661
学年刚开始的时候, 他把钱存在钱筒
At the beginning of the school year he had buried ajar ofpennies...

71
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:04,167
埋在他家的屋子下
...underneath his house.

72
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:07,068
他曾划了张藏宝图 以便日后再挖出来
He drew a treasure map so he could find them again.

73
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:10,971
不料一个星期后 他妈整理房间时把那张图丢了
A week later his mom cleaned out his room and threw away the map.

74
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:14,834
维恩花了九个月的时间 在屋子下东挖西掘
Vern had been trying to find those pennies for nine months...

75
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,436
九个月耶
...nine months, man.

76
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:19,005
真让人哭笑不得
You didn't know whetherlaugh or cry.

77
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:22,778
老天，比利 我们一定要想想办法
Jesus, Billy, we gotta do something.

78
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,616
为什么？谁会管这件事？
Why? Who cares?

79
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,452
但我们看见他 又怎样？不干我们的事
We saw him.  So?

80
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:29,858
那小鬼已经死了 也无法再让他复活
It's nothin' to us. The kid's dead so it's nothin' to him, neither.

81
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:32,055
谁在乎是不是有人发现他 我才不管
And who gives a shit if they ever find him? I don't.

82
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:36,329
可是收音机常提到那孩子的事
It's that kid they're talking about on the radio.

83
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,802
他好像叫布罗克 还是布罗尔或佛罗尔
Brocker or Brower or Flowers, whatever his name is.

84
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:43,032
他一定是被火车撞死的
The train must have hit him.

85
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,440
没什么大不了的
Big fucking deal.

86
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,344
我们对雷布罗尔的事很注意
We had all followed the Ray Browerstory closely...

87
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,075
因为他和我们同龄
...since he was a kid our age.

88
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,710
三天前他出门采蓝莓 此后即失去踪影
Three days before, he Ieft to pick blueberries and nobody'd seen him since.

89
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,651
我想我们应该报警
I think we should tell the cops.

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,179
我们偷了车你还敢 去招惹警察，你这白痴
You don't go squawking to the cops after you boosted a car.

91
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,920
他们一定会问我们 怎么去后哈洛路的
They'll want to know how we got way out on Back Harlow Road.

92
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,825
他们知道我们没有车子
They know we don't got no car.

93
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,524
我们最好别泄漏这件事 这样他们就动不了我们
It's best we just keep quiet, then they can't touch us.

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,466
或者我们可以打个匿名电话
But we could make an anonymous call.

95
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,298
他们会追查出来的，蠢蛋
They trace those calls stupid.

96
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,203
我在电视的警探片里看过
I seen it on Highway Patrol and on Dragnet.

97
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,672
也对
Yeah, right.

98
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,370
要是我们没偷那辆 该死的道奇轿车就好了
I wish we never boosted that goddamned Dodge.

99
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,437
如果当时艾斯和我们一起 就可以说我们是坐他的车子
I wish Ace had been with us.

100
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,745
可惜他当时不在场 要不要告诉他？
We could've said he was in his car.  He wasn't!

101
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,409
这件事我们不能告诉任何人
Are we gonna tell him?  We're not going to tell nobody.

102
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,680
绝对不能告诉任何人
Nobody, never. You dig me?

103
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,745
我知道后哈洛路
I know the Back Harlow Road.

104
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,620
它一直通到罗耶河边
It comes to a dead end by the Royal River.

105
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,025
有铁路经过那里
The train tracks are right there.

106
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,188
我和我老爸 以前去过那一带钓鱼
Me and my dad fished out there.

107
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,698
老天，要是他们知道 你在下面偷听，一定会杀了你
If they had known you were under there, they would've killed you.

108
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,758
他可能由柴母陵 走到哈洛路吗？
Could he have gotten all the way from Chamberlain to Harlow? That's really far.

109
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,132
这段路很远
Sure.

110
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,968
我想他一定是顺着铁道走
He probably started walking on the tracks

111
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,871
就这样一直走到那儿
and followed them the whole way.

112
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,968
一定是
Yeah, right.

113
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,842
然后天黑了 一列火车疾驶而来
And then after dark, a train must have come along

114
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,405
撞死了他
and "el smako".

115
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,416
对啊
Yeah.

116
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,817
对了
Hey gus.

117
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,722
我敢说如果我们先发现他 我们的照片铁定会上报
I bet you, if we find him, we'll get our pictures in the paper.

118
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,283
对，说不定还可以上电视 当然
We could even be on TV.

119
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:07,954
我们将成为英雄 对
Sure.  We'll be heroes.

120
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,793
可是比利会知道 是我泄漏了这个秘密
I don't know. Billy will know I found out.

121
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:13,960
他不会怎么样的 因为是我们发现尸体的
He's not going to care. 'Cause it's gonna be us that find him.

122
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,231
比利和查理，霍根作贼心虚 也莫可奈何
Not Billy and Charlie Hogan, and the boosted the car.

123
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,240
你说不定会获颁勋章，维恩
They'll probably pin a medal on you.

124
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,935
真的吗？
You think so?

125
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,977
当然
Sure.

126
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:24,343
我们该怎么跟爸爸妈妈说？
What'll we tell our folks?

127
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,211
就照你刚才讲的
Exactly what you said.

128
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:28,773
我们三人说 要去你家后院露营
We'll tell our folks that we're tenting in your backfield.

129
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:31,753
你则说要去泰迪家过夜
You tell your folks your sleeping at Teddy's.

130
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,517
同时告诉他们 我们明天要去参加寻宝大赛
Then we say we're going to the drag races the next day.

131
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:36,354
这样一来，我们只要在 明天晚饭时回家就行了
We're rock solid until dinner tomorrow night.

132
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:38,725
老兄，这计划真是天衣无缝
Man that's a plan and a half.

133
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:41,355
但如果我们真在南哈洛 发现那孩子的尸体
But, if we find the body in South Harlow

134
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:44,195
他们就会知道我们撒谎 到时恐怕会被揍扁
they'll know we didn't go to the races. We'll get hided.

135
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,881
那时谁还会管这些，
Nobody will care...

136
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,932
他们赞叹 我们的大发现都来不及
...because everybody will be jazzed at our discovery...

137
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:50,303
其它事都无关紧要了
...it won't make a difference.

138
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,968
反正我老爸没事照样揍我 为这被打一顿也值得
My dad will hide me anyway, but it's worth it.

139
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,137
就是 说干就干，你们怎么说？
Shit, yeah.  Let's do it. What do you say?

140
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,702
去就去 戈帝你呢？
All right.  Gordie?

141
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,647
当然去 维恩？
Sure.

142
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:01,947
我不知道 维恩
Vern? I don't know.

143
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,145
去吧，维恩
Come on, Vern O.

144
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:07,754
维恩…
Vern.

145
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:09,889
好吧
Okay.  All right.

146
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:12,692
太棒了，好极了
Too cool. Very cool.

147
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:17,724
我希望我自己能像他们 一样兴奋，但就是鼓不起劲
I wanted to share my friends' enthusiasm, but I couldn't.

148
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:22,229
那个夏天 父母几乎忘了我的存在
Thatsummer at home, I had become The Invisible Boy.

149
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:28,643
妈，你有没有看到 我的水壶？
Mom, do you know where my canteen is?

150
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,773
妈 ！
Mom?

151
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,851
在丹尼房里
It's in Denny's room.

152
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:42,656
那年四月 我哥哥丹尼在车祸中丧生
In April, my older brother, Dennis, had been killed in ajeep accident.

153
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,989
过了四个月
Four months had passed...

154
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:48,329
我父母仍无法忘怀丧子之痛
...but my parents still hadn't been able to put the pieces back together again.

155
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,602
“岩城高中”

156
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,838
“密西根州立大学”

157
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,702
戈帝，我有样东西给你
Gordie, I got something for you.

158
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:33,540
老弟，这给你
This, my friend, is for you.

159
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:38,650
这是你洋基球队的球帽 它现在是你的了
This is your Yankee cap.  No.

160
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,297
它是顶幸运帽，
This is your Yankee cap.

161
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,137
你猜戴了它 我们可以钓到多少鱼？
It's a good luck cap. Know how many fish we'll catch?

162
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,048
多少？ 成千上万
How much?  A bazillion.

163
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,993
不盖你， 而且你戴它很好看 简直帅毙了
A bazillion fish. It Iooks good on you, too. Just like that.

164
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:49,859
妈呀，怎么黑黑的 少调皮了，小猪
No. I'm going blind.  Don't start with me.

165
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:51,900
过来让你老哥抱一下
Give me a hug.

166
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,625
你找到了
You found it.

167
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,596
你找到了
You found it.

168
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:00,736
是的
Yeah.

169
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:10,250
为什么你不能像丹尼一样 交些好的朋友？
Why can't you have friends Iike Denny's?

170
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,844
他们也没什么不好
Dad, they're okay.

171
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:14,015
才怪，一个是小偷 另外两个是傻瓜
Sure they are. A thief and two feebs.

172
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,249
克利斯并不是小偷
Chris isn't a thief.

173
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,851
他偷了学校的牛奶钱
He stole the milk money at school.

174
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:21,329
不是小偷是什么？
He's a thief in my book.

175
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:41,612
我们出发找雷布罗尔的尸体时
It was almost noon

176
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,210
已经快中午了
as we set out to find the body of a dead kid named Ray Brower.

177
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:45,445
就在这里让我下
Right here's cool.

178
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:48,890
嗨，克利斯
Hey,Chris.

179
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,887
谢了 小事情
Thanks a lot.  Sure thing.

180
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,954
戈帝 嗨，老兄
Hey man.

181
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:56,963
想不想看好东西？ 好啊，什么？
You want to see something?  What?

182
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,865
你还好吧？ 没什么
You okay?  I'm fine.

183
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,734
来啊 到底是什么？
What is it?

184
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:03,707
你一定得看看这玩意儿 好了，快说是什么？
You've got to see this.  What is it?

185
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:09,304
快告诉我是什么？
What is it?

186
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:17,580
你想当独行侠还是大镖客？
You want to be the Lone Ranger or the Cisco Kid?

187
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:20,023
真是太酷了，我的天啊
Walking, talking Jesus!

188
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:21,855
你哪儿弄来的？
Where'd you get this?

189
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:23,657
从我老头的衣柜里摸出来的
Hocked it from my old man's bureau.

190
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,927
这是4 5口径手枪 我看的出来
It's a .45. I can see that.

191
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:33,262
有没有子弹？ 有啊
You got shells for it?

192
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,330
我把盒子里所有子弹都带来了
I took what was left in the box.

193
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:39,242
我爸会以为他喝醉时 射啤酒罐用光了
My dad'll think he used them himself shooting at beer cans while he was drunk.

194
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:43,739
里面装了子弹吗？ 当然没有，你以为我那么笨？
Is it loaded?  Hello, no. What do you think I am?

195
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:46,710
老天
Jesus!

196
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,549
快离开这里
Let's get out of here. Come on.

197
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,249
是戈帝干的 戈帝吕强斯想扫平岩城
Gordie did it. Gordon Lachance is shooting up Castle Rock.

198
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,330
是什么人？谁在这里放炮？
Hey, who did that? Who's Ietting cherry bombs off out here?

199
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,967
你真该看看刚才自己的表情
You should have seen your face. Damn, that was cool!

200
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:07,565
他妈的绝死了 你知道那枪装了子弹，浑球
That was really fine.  You knew it was loaded, you wet end!

201
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:09,734
一定会完蛋 刚才塔波太太看到我了
I'm in trouble now. That Tupper babe saw me.

202
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,539
少来了，戈帝 她以为我们是在放鞭炮
Shit, she thought it was firecrackers.

203
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:14,582
我不管，你不该这样耍我 戈帝
I don't care. It was a mean trick.

204
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:17,918
我也不知道有子弹
I didn't know it was loaded.

205
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,911
不骗你 你敢发誓吗？
Honest.  You swear?

206
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:22,889
好，我发誓
I swear.

207
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,653
以你妈妈的名誉发誓？
On your mother's name?

208
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:25,658
可以
Yeah.

209
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,786
如果你撒谎她得下地狱 你敢吗？
Even if she goes to hell for your lie?

210
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,557
我以此发誓
I swear.

211
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:32,494
一言既出
Pinky swear?

212
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,927
驷马难追
Pinky swear.

213
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,759
小妹妹，上哪儿去？
Girls, where you going?

214
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,822
拿来，那是我哥给我的
Come on, my brother gave me that!

215
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,816
现在你送给我了
And now you're giving it to me.

216
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,909
快还给我 ！ 别这样，那是我的
Give it to me! That's mine.

217
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,150
你真是个大浑球
You're a real asshole, you know that?

218
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,193
大眼，你老弟真没礼貌
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball.

219
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,753
克利斯多佛
Now, Christopher.

220
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:04,323
我知道你不是有意得罪我朋友
I know you didn't mean to insult my friend.

221
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,802
我知道他不是有意的
I know he didn't mean to insult me.

222
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,204
因此我愿给他个机会 收回那句话
That's why I'll give him the opportunity to take it back.

223
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:16,443
他妈的 收回那句话，小鬼
Shit.  Take it back, kid.

224
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:18,174
别这样，快住手 你会打伤他的
Stop it, you're hurting him.

225
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,341
王八蛋，放开我 快住手，别再打了
You bastard! Let go, man. Stop it! Cut it out!

226
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,045
把那句话收回去
Take it back, kid.

227
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:24,345
住手
Cut it out!

228
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,981
好了，我收回那句话
You big... Okay, I take it back.

229
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:32,053
这才对
There.

230
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:35,522
我觉得好多了
Now I feel a whole Iot better about this.

231
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,059
你呢？
How about you?

232
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,604
很好
Good.

233
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,168
待会儿见，小妹妹
See you Iater girls.

234
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,515
算了，忘了这件事
Let's just forget them.

235
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:15,169
我们带那把枪有什么用？
What do we need a pistol for anyway?

236
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:17,231
晚上在森林中过夜很恐怖
It's spooky sleeping out at night in the woods.

237
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,867
你说不定会遇见狗熊
You might see a bear.

238
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,708
也可能撞到…垃圾桶
Or a garbage can.

239
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,420
我带了把梳子 你带梳子有何用？
I brought a comb. What do we need a comb for?

240
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,752
如果我们要上电视 可以打扮的好看一点，是吧？
If we get on TV we want to look good, don't we?

241
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:32,348
你想的真周到，维恩 不敢当
That's a Iot of thinking, Vern.  Thanks.

242
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:34,086
赏你两拳当奖品
Two for flinching.

243
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,133
你想大概得走多远？
How far do you think it's gonna be?

244
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,198
如果一直顺着铁道走到哈洛
If we follow the tracks all the way into Harlow,

245
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:47,069
大概有2 0英里
it should be about 20 miles.

246
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,907
戈帝，你说对不对？ 不错，甚至可能有3 0英里
Sound about right to you? It might even be 30.

247
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,011
那么远，也许我们该搭便车
Maybe we should just hitchhike.

248
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:56,912
不可能的，别妄想了 为什么不行？
No way, that sucks.  Why not?

249
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:59,418
我们可以顺七号公路 到西乐教堂
We could go out to Route 7 to the Shiloh church...

250
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,456
然后顺着后哈洛路走
...then down the Back Harlow Road. We'll be there by sundown.

251
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,390
天黑前就可以到那里 那样有什么意思
That's pussy.

252
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:06,586
不然我们得走好远
It's a long way.

253
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:09,391
你妈怎么会生出你这种儿子？
Did your mother ever have any kids that lived?

254
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,559
什么意思？ 老天
What do you mean?

255
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:22,240
∮ 身怀单枪会遍英雄好汉

256
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:26,474
∮ 赤手空拳不畏龙潭虎穴

257
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:30,315
∮ 快枪利眼闯过惊涛骇浪

258
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:35,255
∮ 这个豪杰就叫做白乐定

259
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:41,558
我们得在垃圾场补充点水份 我爸说那儿有口好井
We have to fill up at the junkyard. My dad said it was a safe well.

260
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:45,231
要是丑巴在就没办法了 它在就派你去
Not if Chopper's there.  If he's there we'll send you in.

261
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:46,701
真好笑
Very funny.

262
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,508
我肚子饿了，谁带了吃的？
I'm kind of hungry. Who's got the food?

263
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,343
他妈的，都没人带吃的吗？
Did anybody bring anything?

264
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,482
我没带，戈帝，你呢？
Not me.

265
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:02,641
好极了
This is great.

266
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,710
这可绝了，我们要怎么办 难道啃自己的脚？
What are we supposed to do? Eat our feet?

267
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,813
你是说你也没带东西？
You mean, you didn't bring anything, either?

268
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,881
又不是我提议要去的 全是维恩出的主意
This wasn't my idea. It was Vern's.

269
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,620
你为什么不带点吃的？
Why didn't you bring something?

270
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:13,095
我怎么可能什么都想到？ 我已经带了梳子
I have to think of everything? I brought the comb.

271
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,961
真了不起，带梳子有个屁用 你连头发都没有
What do you need a comb for? You don't have any hair.

272
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:17,831
我是好心为你们准备的
I brought it for you guys, so you'd have a comb.

273
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:21,035
够了，看看我们有多少钱
Let's see how much money we've got?

274
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:26,610
我有一块二分
I got $1.02.

275
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,772
克利斯有六毛八分
And 68 cents from Chris.

276
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,544
泰迪带了六毛钱
60 cents from Teddy.

277
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:41,089
维恩只有七分？
7 cents, Vern?

278
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,555
我还没找到存钱筒
I haven't found my pennies yet.

279
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,621
总共两块三毛七分，不错了
$2.37 cents, not bad.

280
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,200
垃圾场过去有家杂货店
Quidaciolu's is at the end of the road by the junkyard.

281
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,261
可以去那买点东西
I think we can get some stuff there.

282
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:53,737
火车来了
Train coming.

283
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:58,907
快溜
Geronimo!

284
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,538
来呀，泰迪
Come on, Teddy.

285
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:05,208
不要
No.

286
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,946
等等，我要闪火车
I'm gonna dodge it.

287
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:11,953
泰迪，快离开铁轨，你疯了
Get off the tracks. You're crazy.

288
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:14,893
闪火车，真刺激
Train dodge. Dig it?

289
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:23,058
快点离开铁轨，泰迪 你不要命了吗？
Get the hell off the tracks. You want to get yourself killed?

290
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:25,435
就像在诺曼第海滩一样
Just Iike the beach at Normandy.

291
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,937
算了吧，老兄，快走 不要
Come on,man,come. --No.

292
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,987
别告诉我该怎么做要不然我就杀了你
Don't tell me what to do or I'll kill you.

293
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:50,457
我是在救你的命
I'm trying to save your Iife.

294
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:50,935
你真的不想活了？
You want to kill yourself?

295
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,168
你真的那么想死，混蛋？
Is that what you want, goddamn it?

296
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,558
你可能会没命的
You tried to kill yourself.

297
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:02,910
我不需要褓姆
I don't need no babysitter.

298
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:04,639
我看你需要
You do, too.

299
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,118
握手言和
Skin it.

300
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:15,083
我原来可以闪过的
I could have dodged it.

301
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,323
泰迪，你可以 在回来的路上再闪
Listen, you can dodge it on the way back.

302
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:21,961
和好
Peace.

303
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,198
握手言和吧
Skin it.

304
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,783
“罗斯朗甜蜜的家”

305
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:54,327
这个时候查理和比利 正与艾斯和大眼
About this time, Charlie and Billy were playing mailbox baseball...

306
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:56,264
玩打信箱的游戏
...with Ace and Eyeball.

307
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:59,360
真烂，我出局了 他妈的
Shit on that. Goddamn it!

308
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,427
不应该打木头做的
Shouldn't have gone for a wooden one.

309
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,600
还用你来告诉我，混球
Why don't you tell me something I don't know, asshole?

310
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,437
比利，该你了
Billy, you're up.

311
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:10,504
算你们赢好了，我不想打了
You guys win. I don't want to play no more.

312
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,243
怎么行？
You can't quit.

313
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,344
我们只打了三局 这样成绩就不能算数了
We only played three innings. That'd be a non official game.

314
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,150
艾斯，我和…
Ace, me and....

315
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,853
你们俩是同性恋啊？
What's with you homos?

316
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,895
怎么整天都阴阳怪气的
You've been acting psycho all day.

317
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,064
究竟什么事？
What is it?

318
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,102
没什么 没什么，对吧？
It's nothing, right?

319
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,763
那么赶快打完比赛
Then if you don't mind, I'd Iike to finish this game...

320
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,773
好让我早点收钱，好吗？
...before I start collecting my social security, okay?

321
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,036
比利，该你了，快上
You're up, Billy. Move it.

322
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,409
好吧，把那该死的棒子给我
All right, give me this fucking stick.

323
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,141
开始打吧
Let's play ball.

324
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,383
界外球
Foul ball.

325
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,180
“禁止进入”

326
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,601
维恩，看来你妈 又开车出来乱闯了
Vern, it looks like your mom's been out driving again.

327
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,104
你真幽默
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

328
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,001
退后一点，兄弟们
Stand back, men!

329
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:12,271
伞兵部队进攻
Paratroopers, over the side!

330
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,780
捡破烂的米楼普莱斯曼 不许任何人进他的垃圾场
"No Trespassing" was enforced by Milo Pressman, thejunkman...

331
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,978
恶犬丑巴是他的帮凶
...and his dog, Chopper.

332
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:22,284
岩城的人很少见到这只狗 但提起它都胆颤心惊
The most feared and Ieastseen dog in Castle Rock.

333
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:26,088
据说米楼不但训练它咬人
Legend had it that Milo had trained Chopper notjust to sic...

334
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,653
而且已到了一个命令一个动作 说那里咬那里的地步
...but to sic specific parts of the human anatomy.

335
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,360
听说每次有小孩 翻墙进来被发现了
Thus, a kid who had illegally scaled thejunkyard fence...

336
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:37,735
他就会疯狂大叫 “丑巴，咬他的命根子”
...might hear the dread cry: "Chopper, sic ballsl"

337
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:41,866
但这个时候，米楼 和可怕的丑巴都不见踪影
But right now neither the dread Chopper nor Milo was anywhere in sight.

338
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:46,340
泰迪大概疯了
Teddy's crazy.

339
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,577
快走
Come on, men, move it out!

340
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:51,677
我敢打赌他活不到二十岁
He won't Iive to be 20, I bet.

341
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:53,847
记得那次 你在树上救了他的命？
Remember the time you saved him in the tree?

342
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:55,082
记得
Yeah.

343
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:58,753
我有几次还梦见那件事
I dream about that sometimes.

344
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:00,818
只是在梦里我总是失手没救成
Except in the dream I miss him.

345
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:03,865
总是抓着他几根头发 眼看着他掉下去
I just get a few hairs and down he goes.

346
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:07,300
好奇怪 没错，确实很怪
It's weird. That is weird.

347
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,766
但事实上你没有失手
But you didn't miss him.

348
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,628
克利斯永不失手的，对吧？
Chris Chambers never misses, does he?

349
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,603
那怕天大的问题也万无一失
Not even when the Iadies Ieave the seat down.

350
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,370
我们来赛跑 不要，我不想跑
Race you.

351
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:18,937
看谁先跑到井边，来嘛
No, I don't think so.  Over to the pump.

352
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:20,507
算了，我有点累 开始跑
I'm kind of tired. Go.

353
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,609
你完蛋了，蓝强
You're a dead man, Lachance!

354
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,881
这次蓝强似乎占了上风
It Iooks Iike Lachance has got him this time.

355
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:28,015
他可能会击败詹伯斯 但情况突然改变
He's got Chambers beat.

356
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:29,753
詹伯斯奋力迎头赶上
But what's this? Chambers is making his move.

357
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:31,623
詹伯斯领先冲过终点线
Lachance is fading and it's Chambers at the tape.

358
00:21:31,694 --> 00:21:34,129
听众们兴奋若狂
The crowd goes wild.

359
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:56,517
你们最近还看不看 米老鼠乐部？
You guys been watching The Mickey Mouse Club Iately?

360
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:57,816
有啊
Yeah.

361
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:59,880
我觉得安妮蒂的胸部 好像越来越大
I think Annette's tits are getting bigger.

362
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,483
你真这么想？ 没错，我想他说得没错
You think so?  I think so.

363
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:04,859
最近我也注意到
I think he's right.

364
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,490
她的胸部突然变得很突出
I've been noticing that the A and the E are starting to bend around the sides.

365
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:11,799
安妮蒂的胸部真了不起 是啊
Annette's tits are great.

366
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:14,402
此时此刻好快乐
This is a really good time.

367
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:15,531
快活似神仙
The most.

368
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:16,666
快乐得无以复加
A blast.

369
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:20,506
维恩的意思不只是指 我们可以无拘无束
Vern didn'tjust mean being offlimits inside the junkyard...

370
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,241
也不只是指蒙骗家人
...or fudging on our folks...

371
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:24,977
或顺着铁路到哈洛探险
...or going on a hike up the tracks to Harlow.

372
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,713
当然这些事也是其中的一部份 但还有别的
He meant those things, but...

373
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:30,188
我想我们都有同感 就是大家心意相通
...itseems to me now it was more and that we all knew it.

374
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:32,451
我们应有尽有
Everything was there and around us.

375
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:35,085
发现了真正的自己
We knew exactly who we were

376
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:36,857
而且知道自己要做什么
and exactly where we were going.

377
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,454
那种感觉很微妙
It was grand.

378
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,229
真了不起 光会欺负胖小孩，真棒
Great, spit at the fat kid. Real good.

379
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:46,966
几点了，戈帝？
What time is it?

380
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:49,939
一点十五分
It's a quarter after one.

381
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,979
最好赶快去买吃的 垃圾场三点就开门
You'd better go get the food. Junkyard opens at 3:00.

382
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:54,707
丑巴到时候也会来
Chopper'll be here.

383
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:56,750
咬命根子
Sic balls.

384
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:59,718
你去吧 然后在回来的路口会合我们
You go. You can pick us up on the way back.

385
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:01,584
我才不一个人去 要就大伙一起去
I'm not going alone. We should all go.

386
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:03,055
我要留在这里
I'm staying right here.

387
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:05,388
我也不去
I'm not going.

388
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,428
好了，别吵 我们丢铜板决定
Girls, cool it. We'll flip for it.

389
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:09,656
好
Okay.

390
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:11,164
唯一不一样的人去
Odd man goes.

391
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,097
那就是你，戈帝，你这怪胎
That's you, Gordie, odd as a cod.

392
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,930
快丢，少说废话
Flip or eat lead.

393
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:22,366
全是反面
Four tails.

394
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,675
老天，这是个坏预兆
Jesus, man, that's a goocher.

395
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,578
这并不代表任何意义
That doesn't mean anything.

396
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:28,640
我们再丢一次 真的
No, Iet's go again.

397
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,206
这预兆代表恶运
That's really bad.

398
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,150
你们还记得 克林布拉肯那帮人…
Remember Clint Bracken and those guys

399
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,121
被干的事吗？
got wiped out on Weed Hill in Durham?

400
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:36,783
比利说 他们当时以丢铜板赌啤酒
He said they flipped for beers and they came up with a goocher...

401
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:40,022
在离开酒吧前 他们也丢了个全是反面的凶兆
...just before they got in the car.

402
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:42,859
结果砰的一声 他们全被炸得血肉横飞
And, bang! They all got totalled.

403
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:45,593
我不喜欢这种兆头
I don't like this. Sincerely.

404
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:46,930
维恩
Vern.

405
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:50,632
没人相信 这种胡说八道的鬼话
Nobody believes that crap about moons and goochers.

406
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:52,197
再丢一次
It's baby stuff. Now come on, flip again.

407
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:57,646
你到底丢不丢？
Are you going to flip or not?

408
00:23:57,714 --> 00:23:59,705
快点，维恩 我们不能耗一整天
We don't have all day.

409
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:05,312
你输了，戈帝
You lose, Gordie.

410
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:10,523
戈帝输了 戈帝老兄一定是昨晚做了坏事
Gordie loses. Old Gordie just screwed the pooch.

411
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:13,222
你知道 “白痴” 是什么意思吗？
Does the word "retarded" mean anything to you?

412
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,656
戈帝，快去买东西吧 你这贱货
Go get the provisions, you morphadite.

413
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:19,133
请不要用你妈的小名叫我
Don't call me any of your mother's pet names.

414
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:21,694
你真像个大姑娘似的
What a wet end you are, Lachance.

415
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:24,230
闭嘴 我不闭嘴
Shut up.

416
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,641
我越长越大，每次看到你 仍忍不住张大嘴，想吐
I don't shut up, I grow up. And when I look at you, I throw up.

417
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,340
然后你妈会走到墙角 把地上舔得一干二净
Then your mother goes around the corner and she Iicks it up.

418
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:37,920
能找出恶心低级的新字眼 来调侃朋友的母亲
Finding new and disgusting ways to degrade a friend's mother...

419
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:40,856
对我们是件很有面子的事
...was always held as high regard.

420
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:44,862
“奎塔西路加油站”

421
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:56,104
你不是丹尼蓝强的弟弟吗？
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?

422
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:57,506
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

423
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:02,009
他发生意外真是可惜
Shame what happened to him.

424
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,517
圣经上说 “生命中 常笼罩着死亡的阴影”
The Bible says, "In the midst of Iife we are in death".

425
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:07,553
你听过吗？
Did you know that?

426
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:11,046
我有一个弟弟在韩国战死
I Iost a brother in Korea.

427
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:16,256
你长得挺像丹尼 有人告诉过你吗？
You Iook Iike your brother Denny. People ever tell you that?

428
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:19,226
有几次
Sometimes.

429
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:24,231
我还记得那年他打过全国联赛
I remember the year he was All Conference.

430
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:26,328
他担任四分卫
Quarterback, he played.

431
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:29,131
他传起球来真有一手
Boy, could he throw.

432
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,768
圣父，圣子和圣灵
Father God and Sonny Jesus.

433
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,309
明天的球赛 可能有些球探会到场
Could be some scouts at the game tomorrow.

434
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:42,446
很难说，爸 可不可以把马铃薯给我？
I don't know, Pop.  Dad, could I have the potatoes?

435
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:45,890
听说球探一定会来，儿子 你打完球是否要和珍妮见面
That's what I hear, Son.  Are you going to see Jane after the game?

436
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,790
她是个很可爱的女孩
I think she's a Iovely girl.

437
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:51,923
麻烦把马铃薯给我好吗？ 桃乐兰，别谈女孩子的事
Dad, may I please have the potatoes?  Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.

438
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,629
这时他应该心无杂念，这是 他生命中最重要的一场比赛
He shouldn't be thinking about girls. This is the biggest game of his Iife.

439
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,636
丹尼，你明天比赛的时候…
Dennis, when you're there tomorrow...

440
00:25:58,706 --> 00:26:01,903
爸，你有没有看到 戈帝写的那篇文章？
Did you read the story Gordie wrote?

441
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:02,315
写得真的很好
Gordie wrote a story.

442
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,198
你写了些什么，宝贝？
It was really good.  What did you write, sweetheart?

443
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:08,781
你看，我说得不错吧 踢足球一定要集中精神
That's what I'm talking about. Football takes concentration.

444
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:11,910
而你却跟他提女友的事 害他心不在焉
You start in on the girls and his mind's all over the place.

445
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:15,684
戈帝，我喜欢那篇文章 我觉得你写得很棒
I really liked it. I thought it was great.

446
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,158
你也会玩足球吗？
You play football?

447
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,459
我说你也会玩足球吗？
Do you play football?

448
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:29,971
不会
No.

449
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,802
那你会什么？
What do you do?

450
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,666
我不知道
I don't know.

451
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:39,347
总之，你哥哥丹尼 足球玩得真是好
Your brother, Denny, sure could play football.

452
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:47,146
我看看，一块半汉堡
There you go, kid. $1.50 of hamburger.

453
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:17,719
小鬼，你们在那里做什么？ 给我过来
You, kid! What are you doing there! Come over here!

454
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:20,354
回来这里
You, come back here,

455
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:23,086
他妈的再不回来 我就放狗咬你们
goddamn it! I'll sic my dog on you.

456
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,889
快跑，戈帝，快跑
Run!

457
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:27,761
丑巴，咬他， 咬那孩子
Chopper, sic him! Sic him, boy!

458
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,424
他说的是 “咬那孩子”
Now he said: "Sic him, boy".

459
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:33,528
但我听成了 “丑巴，咬他命根子”
But what I heard was: "Chopper, sic balls".

460
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,349
那就是丑巴？
That's Chopper?

461
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,516
看见丑巴使我第一次
Chopper was my firstlesson

462
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:56,289
了解到传言 和事实的差距那么大
in the vast difference between myth and reality.

463
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:58,762
来呀，丑屁，来亲我的屁股
Come on, Choppie. Kiss my ass, Choppie.

464
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:01,631
来吃屎吧，臭狗
Come on, bite shit.

465
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:06,295
过来， 丑屁 看你敢不敢咬我的命根子
Sic balls, Choppie.

466
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:09,398
小鬼，别逗那只狗 听见没有
You kids stop teasing that dog! You hear me? Stop teasing him!

467
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:12,444
小混蛋，你们再笑它 我打烂你们的屁股
Sonny, I'm gonna beat your ass, teasing my dog Iike that!

468
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:15,311
那就翻过墙来抓我们 大肥猪
Let's see you climb over this fence and get me, fat ass!

469
00:28:15,382 --> 00:28:18,545
你敢这样叫我 你这个小人渣
Don't you call me that!

470
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,712
你是个疯子的小孩
You Iittle tin weasel peckerwood Ioony's son!

471
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:23,484
你叫我什么？
What did you call me?

472
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:26,788
我知道你，你是泰迪杜强
I know who you are, you're Teddy Duchamp.

473
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,487
你爸爸是个神经病
Your dad's a loony.

474
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:30,724
他现在被关在 托哥斯的疯人院里
A Ioony up in the nuthouse at Togus.

475
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,961
他曾经把你耳朵扯到火炉边 差点烧了你的狗耳
He took your ear and he put it to a stove and he burnt it off.

476
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:37,330
我父亲是诺曼第登陆战的英雄
My father stormed the beach at Normandy.

477
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,805
他比茅房里的老鼠还神经
He's crazier than a shithouse rat.

478
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:41,841
难怪你也不大正常
No wonder you're acting the way you are...

479
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,639
真是有疯父必有疯子
...with a loony for a father.

480
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:47,409
你再说我爹是疯子 我就杀了你
You call my dad a loony again and I'll kill you.

481
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:49,040
疯子 ！ 疯子 ！ 疯子 ！
Loony, Ioony.

482
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,383
我要拧断你的头 打断你的颈子
I'm gonna rip your head off and shit down your neck.

483
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:55,355
不行，我要杀了他
No, I'm gonna kill him!

484
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:57,914
有种过来试试 你这讨厌的小王八蛋
You come on and try it, you Iittle slimy bastard.

485
00:28:57,994 --> 00:29:01,259
他只是想骗你过去揍你一顿 然后把你交给警察
He wants you to go over so he can beat you up then take you to the cops.

486
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:04,265
你给我闭嘴，精灵鬼 让他自己来打一架
You watch your mouth. Let him do his own fighting.

487
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,359
你起码比他重五百磅，大肥猪
Sure, you only outweigh him by 500 pounds, fat ass.

488
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:09,563
我知道你的名字
I know your name.

489
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:12,436
你是蓝强家的小鬼 你们我全都认识
You're Lachance. I know all you guys.

490
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:15,204
我等会儿 会打电话给你们的爸爸
And your fathers will get a call from me.

491
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:18,610
除了那个被关在托哥斯的疯子
Except for the Ioony up in Togus.

492
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,118
我要杀了你
I'm going to kill you. I'll show you.

493
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:25,381
满口脏舌的小烂货
Get him away from...  You foulmouthed whoremaster.

494
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,456
你是婊子养的
You son of a bitch!

495
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:29,685
滚回来 回来，听到没有？
You come back here. Do you hear me?

496
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,353
我不准任何人侮辱我老头 回来
Nobody ranks out my old man.

497
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:35,330
我爸爸是诺曼第登陆的英雄
My father stormed the beach...  I said, "Come back here!"

498
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,061
他是个英雄，大肥猪
He stormed the beach, you faggot!  Come back here.

499
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:50,401
我们已经给了他颜色看 他还以为我们好欺负
We showed him. Thought we were a bunch of pussies.

500
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:53,173
他侮辱我老头
He ranked my old man.

501
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:56,948
我不明白泰迪为什么 那么在乎他那狠心的爸爸？
I wondered how he could care so much for his dad who'd almost killed him...

502
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:59,012
要是我爸我才不在乎
...and I didn't care about my own

503
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,457
而他自我三岁后就没摸过我
who hadn't touched me since I was three.

504
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:03,517
而那次还是为了 我偷吃水槽下的洗衣粉
That was for eating bleach under the sink.

505
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,960
他侮辱我老头
He ranked my old man.

506
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,693
你何必管那肥得像屎蛋 怎么说你爸？
What do you care what a fat old pile of shit like him says about your dad?

507
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,760
不管他怎么讲，你爸仍然是 登陆诺曼第的英雄，对吧？
He still stormed the beach at Normandy, right?

508
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,066
算了，别提了
Just forget it.

509
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:16,198
难道那老混球 也登陆过诺曼第？
Do you think that pile of shit was at Normandy?

510
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,674
别提了，好吧？
Forget it, all right?

511
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,904
他根本对你老头一无所知 只会乱放狗屁
He knows nothin' about your old man. He's shit.

512
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:23,414
你和你爸的感情 绝不会因他而改变
Whatever's between you and your old man, he can't change that.

513
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,882
别提了，好吗？ 别再说了
Forget it, all right? Just forget it!

514
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:44,060
∮ 身怀单枪会遍英雄好汉

515
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:48,403
∮ 赤手空拳不畏龙潭虎穴

516
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:59,678
很抱歉， 因为我扫了大家的兴
I'm sorry if I'm spoiling everybody's good time.

517
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:01,743
没什么，不要这样想
It's okay.

518
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:05,451
我怀疑这件事会真值得高兴
I'm not sure it should be a good time.

519
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:07,517
你想回去了？
You saying you want to go back?

520
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:09,051
不是
No.

521
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:12,129
但去看一个死了的孩子
But going to see a dead kid,

522
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,292
不应该像去参加舞会一样
maybe it shouldn't be a party.

523
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:16,496
对呀
Yeah.

524
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,836
说不定他血肉模糊 四分五裂
If he's really bad, like all cut up with blood and shit all over him...

525
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:23,638
我一定会做恶梦 好了，维恩
...I might have nightmares.

526
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:26,579
也许他内脏和眼珠子 都跑了出来，他还会抓人
All guts and eyeballs ready to jump and grab...

527
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:30,083
不讲话没人当你是哑巴 我忍不住嘛
Shut up, goddamn it! I can't help it.

528
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,044
对不起
Sorry.

529
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:38,022
这时是两点四十五分 但感觉上已很晚
It was only a quarter to three, butit felt much later.

530
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:40,722
也许是因为天气太热 以及出了太多意外
It was too hot and too much had happened.

531
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:43,855
我们连罗耶河都还没看见
We weren't even close to the Royal River.

532
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:47,891
如果想在天黑前多赶点路 非得加快脚步
We needed to get moving if we were going to make some real miles before dark.

533
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:55,537
“眼镜蛇”

534
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:58,273
别动好吧
Hold still, will you?

535
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:07,018
你和那个叫康妮巴乐摩道的 小妞进展如何？
So what's with you and this Connie Palermo chick?

536
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,148
我们约会了一个月
I've been seeing her for over a month,

537
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:11,558
她只肯让我摸她胸部
and all she'll let me do is feel her tits.

538
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:15,154
她是个天主教徒，兄弟
She's a Catholic. They're all like that.

539
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:18,224
他们就是这副德性 你要泡个清教徒
You want to get Iaid you gotta get yourself a Protestant.

540
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:20,626
犹太人也可以
A Jew's good.

541
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:23,362
K L AM电台新闻快报
A KLAM newsbreak.

542
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,930
现在暂时中断节目
We interrupt to bring you an update on the search for...

543
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:27,774
为您报导搜寻十二岁 失踪男孩雷布罗尔最新进展
...12 year old Ray Brower.

544
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,778
警方已扩大搜索范围
The police have expanded theirsearch to Mutton...

545
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,007
至莫顿与德汉镇及其郊区
...Durham and the outlying areas.

546
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:33,913
他们什么时候才死心
When are they going to give up?

547
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:36,077
那小鬼死了 他们永远也找不到他
The kid's gone. They'll never find him.

548
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:38,348
他们找错了地方 嘿
Not where they're Iooking.

549
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,948
我说对了吧，查理 我们绝对找不到他
I was right, they ain't never gonna find him.

550
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,256
你别乱动好吗？ 害我把蛇身都划歪了
Would you hold still? You're making me fuck up the snake part.

551
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,456
我知道他们何时才会发现他
I'll tell you how they're gonna find him.

552
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,365
等到十年后 有猎户进森林里尿尿时
Ten years from now a hunter's going to go into the woods to take a Ieak...

553
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,596
他们会发现 自己竟尿在他的骨头上
...wind up pissing on his bones.

554
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,901
我赌一千块要不了那么久 他就会被发现
I bet you a $1,000 they find him before that.

555
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,942
两千元赌他们找不到
Bet you $2,000 they don't.

556
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,841
既然这样，混球… 这件事有什么好赌的？
Well, asshole...  What's the big deal?

557
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,174
管他们找不找得到
Who cares?

558
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,442
你们两个都给我闭上狗嘴
Would you two just shut the fuck up.

559
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,780
要是你们两个混球有两千元 我早把你们给宰了
If either one of you assholes had $2,000, I'd kill you both.

560
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,978
现在又回到鲍伯克米尔 主持的音乐时间
We're back here with The Bossman.

561
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,546
下面为您介绍一首 超人气畅销曲
From the racks and stacks, it's the best on wax.

562
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:14,616
柯爹合唱团的 “棒棒糖”
It's the Cordettes, with Lollipop.

563
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:44,420
我有些香烟 从我老头衣柜里弄来的
I got some Winstons. Hocked them off my old man's dresser.

564
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:47,825
吃过晚饭可以来一根 酷毙了
One apiece, for after supper. That's cool.

565
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:52,097
“饭后一根烟，快活似神仙”
That's when a cigarette tastes best, after supper.

566
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,792
是啊
Right.

567
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,905
你觉得我是个怪人吗？ 不是才怪
Do you think I'm weird?

568
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:06,505
老兄，我是说真的 我真的很古怪吗？
Definitely.  No, seriously. Am I weird?

569
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:10,109
是的，那又怎么样？ 每个人都有怪的地方
Yes, but so what? Everybody's weird.

570
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,326
上学的事你已预备好了吗？ 好了
You ready for school?

571
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:24,729
你知道那代表什么？
You know what that means.

572
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:28,036
明年六月我们就要散了
By next June we'll all be split up.

573
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:30,334
你说什么？怎么会呢？
What are you talking about? Why would that happen?

574
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:33,135
因为那时 一切都和上小学不一样了
'Cause it's not going to be Iike grammar school, that's why.

575
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,199
你要读大学先修班
You'll be taking college courses,

576
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:38,509
而我，泰迪和维恩 得和其他白痴进就业班
and me, Teddy, Vern we'll all be...

577
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:41,378
学做烟灰缸或鸟笼之类的东西
...in the shop courses making ashtrays and birdhouses.

578
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:45,984
到时你会认识很多新朋友
You're gonna meet a lot of new guys.

579
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:47,488
全都是聪明人
Smart guys.

580
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:49,457
你的意思是认识一堆拙蛋
Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean.  No, man.

581
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:52,494
不要这样说，老兄 也千万别那样想
Don't say that. Don't even think that.

582
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:55,156
我不会去和那些驴蛋 混在一起的，别想
I'm not going in with a Iot of pussies.

583
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:56,596
那么你就是个混蛋
Then you're an asshole.

584
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,658
想和你们当朋友算是混蛋？
What's asshole with wanting to be with your friends?

585
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:00,897
和害你堕落的人来往就是混球
It's asshole if your friends drag you down.

586
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:04,771
和我们在一起，你只会变成 一个满脑子浆糊的老油条
You hang with us, you'll just be another wise guy with shit for brains.

587
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:07,675
你想太空飞鼠打得赢超人吗？
You think Mighty Mouse could beat up Superman?

588
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:10,339
你是不是头脑有问题？ 为什么不行？
What are you, cracked?  Why not?

589
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:13,440
有一天他一只手举起五只大象
The other day, he was carrying five elephants in one hand.

590
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:15,508
老天，你真不是普通的笨
You don't know nothin'.

591
00:35:15,586 --> 00:35:19,147
太空飞鼠只是卡通人物 超人则是真正的人
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon. Superman is a real guy.

592
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:21,714
卡通里的人 怎么可能打得赢真人？
No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.

593
00:35:22,894 --> 00:35:25,794
也许你说得有道理
Yeah, maybe you're right.

594
00:35:25,863 --> 00:35:28,025
要是他们打起来一定很精彩
Would be a good fight, though.

595
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:33,094
有一天 你也许会成为作家，戈帝
You could be a real writer someday.

596
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:35,833
去他的写作 我才不要当什么鬼作家
Fuck writing! I don't to be a writer.

597
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:38,102
蠢人才当作家 才把时间浪费在写文章
It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.  That's your dad talking.

598
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:40,167
那全是你爸的口气 胡扯
Bullshit!  Bulltrue!

599
00:35:40,245 --> 00:35:44,114
才怪 我知道你爸根本不管你
I know how your dad feels about you. He doesn't care about you.

600
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:47,083
他一向只关心丹尼 别告诉我我说错了
Denny was the one he cared about, and don't try to tell me different.

601
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,854
你还只是个孩子，戈帝
You're just a kid, Gordie.

602
00:35:55,928 --> 00:35:57,759
是吗？谢谢你，老爹
Gee thanks, Dad.

603
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,424
我倒真希望我是你爸爸
I wish to hell I was your dad.

604
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,233
那样你就不至于 有想上就业班的蠢念头
You wouldn't be talking about taking these stupid shop courses if I was.

605
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,235
上帝赐予你珍贵的礼物
It's like God gave you something, man,

606
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:11,368
你编的那些故事
all those stories that you can make up...

607
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:14,710
他一定希望你珍惜这能力 不要糟蹋了它
...and He said, "This is what we got for you. Try not to lose it".

608
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:18,181
但除非有人好好看顾 小孩子常会糟蹋东西
Kids Iose everything unless there's someone there to look out for them.

609
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:21,778
如果你父母不愿尽责 也许真该由我来盯着你
If your parents are too fucked up to do it, then maybe I should.

610
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:24,980
两位老兄，快点
Come on, you guys, let's get moving.

611
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,221
再不快点，等我们到那里 那小鬼说不定又活过来了
By the time we get there the kid won't even be dead anymore.

612
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:17,674
你们知不知道 下一班火车什么时候来？
Any of you guys know when the next train is due?

613
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:20,180
我们可以走 1 3 6号公路的桥过河
We could go down to the Route 136 Bridge.

614
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:23,413
你疯了？我们得顺着河 走五英里才能到那座桥
What? Are you crazy? That's five miles down the river.

615
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:26,512
然后我们又得顺着河 走五英里路回到铁路
You walk five miles down the river, you gotta walk five miles back.

616
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:28,454
说不定得走到天黑
That could take till dark.

617
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:31,517
我说我们就由这里过河 不到十分钟就可以到对岸
We go across here, we can get to the same place in 10 minutes.

618
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:34,961
可是如果火车来了 我们就无路可走了
But if a train comes, there's nowhere to go.

619
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:38,627
谁说没有，可以跳下去 泰迪，这桥有一百英尺高
No, there isn't. You just jump.

620
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:39,827
是啊，泰迪
Teddy, it's a 100 feet.  Yeah, Teddy.

621
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:42,463
你们如果想绕远路，请便
You guys can go around if you want.

622
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,370
我要由这里过河
I'm crossing here.

623
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,416
等你们拖着大屁股
And while you guys are dragging your candyasses...

624
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:49,229
绕完半个地球回来时
...half way across the state and back,

625
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:51,680
我早已在对岸等着
I'll be waiting for you on the other side...

626
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:54,479
陷入我的一片思绪中
...relaxing with my thoughts.

627
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:56,884
你沉思时 打算用左手或右手托腮？
You use your left hand or your right hand for that?

628
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,122
你等着看好了
You wish.

629
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:07,655
我的梳子掉了
I Iost the comb.

630
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:10,427
算了，维恩
Forget it, Vern.

631
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:48,693
火车来了
Train!

632
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:54,700
真倒霉
Shit!

633
00:39:54,777 --> 00:39:56,472
快点走，泰迪，快点
Move it, man! Go on! Move it!

634
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:59,207
起来，维恩，他妈的
Get up, Vern! Damn it!

635
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:02,115
起来，快走
Get up! Move it!

636
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,616
他妈的，维恩，站起来
Shit, Vern!

637
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:07,349
快点，维恩 不行，我们会掉下去
Get up, man!  I don't want to. We're gonna fall.

638
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:11,882
我们会被撞死，起来
We're gonna die, damn it! Get up!

639
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,122
快跑
Go.

640
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,493
快跑
Go away.

641
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,068
跑快一点 我办不到，戈帝
You've got to go faster!  I can't, Gordie!

642
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:28,724
快跑
Run!

643
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:36,576
快跑 戈帝，跑快点，加油
Run, Vern, run! Move your ass!

644
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:39,054
加油，维恩
Run, goddamn it, run!

645
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:43,924
快跑
Run!

646
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:45,926
加油
Come on!

647
00:41:11,022 --> 00:41:13,684
现在我们知道 火车什么时候会来了
At Ieast now we know when the next train was due.

648
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:26,766
这是前所未见的闪火车表演 真不是盖的
That was the all time train dodge. Too cool.

649
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:28,863
维恩，你刚才吓得
You were so scared you Iooked like

650
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,933
就像亚柏特那胖子 看见木乃伊的表情一样
Abbott Costello when he saw the mummy.

651
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:34,104
我才没有那么害怕
I wasn't that scared.

652
00:41:34,247 --> 00:41:35,407
维恩
Vern!

653
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:37,608
真的，我没有，不骗你们
No, really, I wasn't. Sincerely.

654
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:40,880
那你让我们检查裤裆 看有没有吓出尿来
Then you won't mind if we check your underpants for Hershey squirts.

655
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:42,443
去你的
Go screw.

656
00:41:42,488 --> 00:41:44,251
维恩，你最好把汉堡翻个面
You'd better turn yours over.

657
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:47,053
我喜欢烤焦一点 随你
This is the way I like to do it.

658
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:50,392
糟了 还有吗，戈帝？
Man!

659
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:51,954
没有了，维恩，真遗憾
You got any more, Gordie? Sorry, Vern.

660
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:54,263
一点也不好笑 这下我要吃什么？
It's not funny. What am I supposed to eat?

661
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:57,667
你为什么不烤了老二吃？ 虽小但也算一餐
Why don't you cook your dick?  It'd be a small meal.

662
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:03,468
你们这些王八蛋，我捡回来了
Screw you guys, I got it.

663
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:21,156
饭后一根烟 快乐似神仙
Nothing like a smoke after a meal.

664
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:24,995
我珍视此刻
I cherish these moments.

665
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:30,268
怎么了？我说了什么？
What? What did I say?

666
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:37,377
戈帝，说个故事听听好不好？
Gordie, why don't you tell us a story?

667
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:38,935
这个嘛
I don't know.

668
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:41,448
好嘛 好嘛，戈帝
Come on.  Yeah, come on, Gordie.

669
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,644
可是千万别说鬼故事
None of your horror stories, okay?

670
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,485
我现在不想听鬼故事
I don't want to hear no horror stories. I'm not up for that.

671
00:42:47,556 --> 00:42:51,048
说个关于史帝尔士官 和他勇猛的陆战队弟兄的故事
Tell us one about Sergeant Steel and his battling leathernecks.

672
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:54,290
我想说的故事 和以前的不大一样
The one I've been thinking about is kind of different.

673
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,389
它的主题是吃派大赛
It's about this pie eating contest.

674
00:42:56,465 --> 00:43:00,835
主角是个人见人厌的胖小孩 叫大卫霍根
The main guy of the story is this fat kid that nobody Iikes, named Davie Hogan.

675
00:43:00,904 --> 00:43:03,873
可能是查理霍根的弟弟 如果他有个弟弟
Like Charlie Hogan's brother, if he had one.

676
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:05,202
你真聪明，维恩
Good, Vern.

677
00:43:06,276 --> 00:43:08,301
说下去，戈帝
Go on.

678
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,176
这个胖孩子年纪和我们差不多 但他很胖
Well, this kid, he's our age, but he's fat.

679
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:12,909
非常胖
Real fat.

680
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:15,508
他的体重将近1 8 0磅 但这不是他的错
He weighs close to 180, but it's not his fault.

681
00:43:15,585 --> 00:43:17,486
因为他的内分泌不正常
It's his glands.

682
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:19,853
我的表姐就是这样，不骗你们
My cousin's Iike that. Sincerely.

683
00:43:19,924 --> 00:43:21,914
她的体重超过三百磅
She weighs over 300 pounds.

684
00:43:21,993 --> 00:43:24,928
好像是因为 内分泌腺失调之类的毛病
Supposed to be a "hyboid" gland or somethin'.

685
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:27,987
我不知道什么是内分泌 但她的吨位真是惊人
I don't know about any "hyboid" gland, but what a blimp!

686
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:32,058
不盖你们，她看起来 就像只感恩节火鸡，有一次…
No shit. She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.

687
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:34,001
闭嘴，维恩
And, you know, this one time...  Shut up, Vern.

688
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:37,041
好的，说下去，戈帝 这是个好故事
Right. Go on. It's a swell story.

689
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:41,169
别的孩子都不叫他大卫 而称呼他 “猪臀”
All the kids, instead of calling him Davie, they called him Lardass.

690
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:42,837
猪臀霍根
Lardass Hogan.

691
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:45,940
连他的弟弟妹妹们也这么叫他
Even his little brother and sister called him Lardass.

692
00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:50,284
而在学校， 同学们又给他 取了个外号叫 “欧罗肥”
At school they put this sticker on his back that says, "Wide Load".

693
00:43:50,354 --> 00:43:53,882
一逮到机会就打他骂他
And they rank him out and beat him up whenever they get a chance.

694
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,587
有一天他心中突然灵光一闪
But one day he gets an idea.

695
00:43:57,562 --> 00:44:00,292
想出了一个 小孩能想出的
The greatest revenge idea

696
00:44:00,365 --> 00:44:02,527
最伟大报复方法
a kid ever had.

697
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:06,298
这玩意儿开了吗？ 听不到的话请举手
Is this thing on? Can you hear me?

698
00:44:06,371 --> 00:44:09,033

你没事吧，小伙子？ 旅途还愉快吗？
Are you all right, young man?  Lardass how was your trip?

711
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:09,233
听说你胃口不小，猪臀
I hear you got a big appetite, Lardass.

712
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:11,295
但你休想闯过我这关
Don't even think about winning this.

713
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:14,675
小子，你可真够肥
Boy are you fat.

714
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:19,011
别理那些傻瓜，猪臀
Don't pay attention to those fools, Lardass.

715
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,844

721
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,247
请各位把手放到背后

722
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,319
击鼓
Drum roll.

723
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,220
猪臀，用力吃啊
Hey, Lardass.

724
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,260
欧罗肥，加油
Chow down, Wide Load.

725
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,252
开始
Go.

726
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,764
吃完了
Done!

727
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:28,144
吃完了
Done!

728
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:36,754
吃完了
Done!

729
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,727
如果你想撑下去，小子 最好放慢速度
You better pace yourself, if you want to hold out.

730
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,290
猪臀，加油
Come on, Lardass!

731
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,359
猪臀
Lardass,

732
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:47,496
猪臀…
Lardass!

733
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,973
观众们料想不到
What the audience didn't know,

734
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:00,884
猪臀其实并不在乎胜负
was that Lardass wasn't interested in winning.

735
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:02,979
他只想要报复
What he wanted was revenge.

736
00:47:04,457 --> 00:47:07,824
而且在上台前，他即已准备好
And right before he was introduced, he'd gotten ready for it.

737
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,826
“蓖麻油”

738
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:40,816
吃完了
...it's....Done.

739
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,332
吃到第五客时
Diving into his fifth pie

740
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:47,994
猪臀开始想像 自己吃的不是派
Lardass began to imagine that he wasn't eating pies.

741
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:50,866
而是牛的内脏
He pretended he was eating cowflops...

742
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,998
老鼠肉和蓝莓酱
...and rat guts in blueberry sauce.

743
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:54,773
吃完了
Done.

744
00:47:57,846 --> 00:48:01,943
渐渐地 猪臀的肚子开始发出响声
Slowly, a sound started to build in Lardass's stomach.

745
00:48:03,051 --> 00:48:06,111
一种怪异而吓人的响声
A strange and scary sound...

746
00:48:06,189 --> 00:48:09,454
那声音就像大卡车 以一百英里时速疾冲而来
...like a log truck coming atyou at 100 miles an hour.

747
00:48:23,573 --> 00:48:26,600
突然，猪臀张开他的嘴
Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth...

748
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:29,409
在比尔泰惠兹察觉之前
...and before Bill Travis knew it...

749
00:48:29,479 --> 00:48:33,848
把吃下去的五个派 全吐在他的身上，沾满他全身
...he was covered with five pies worth of used blueberries.

750
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:36,215
观众席上的女生 吓得放声大叫
The women in the audience screamed.

751
00:48:36,286 --> 00:48:39,914
电台主持人鲍伯克米尔 看了泰惠兹一眼
Bossman Bob Cormier took one Iook at Bill Travis

752
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:41,480
吐了卫根斯校长满头满脸
and barfed on Wiggins.

753
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:45,354
卫根斯也吐在 坐他旁边的伐木工人身上
Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack that was sitting next to him.

754
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:48,830
葛兰迪市长 则吐在他太太的胸前
Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's titsl

755
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:51,424
但直到那些秽物的味道 传到观众席
But when the smell hit the crowd...

756
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:55,165
猪臀的报复行动才进入高潮
...that's when Lardass's plan really started to work.

757
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,104
女孩们吐得男朋友满身狼籍
Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends.

758
00:48:57,174 --> 00:49:00,406
孩子们则全吐在父母身上 有位胖女士在皮包里大吐
Kids barfed on theirparents.

759
00:49:00,477 --> 00:49:03,003
康奈利孪生兄弟 不约而同吐了对方一身
A fatlady barfed in herpurse. The Donelley twins barfed on each other.

760
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:05,864
妇女会的会员 也吐得羚羊保育会的会员 全身都是
The Women's Auxiliary barfed all over the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.

761
00:49:07,852 --> 00:49:11,754
此时猪臀得意洋洋地坐在台上 欣赏自己的杰作
And Lardass just sat back and enjoyed what he'd created.

762
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:16,891
千古难见的呕吐大会串
A complete and total barfarama.

763
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:27,501
酷毙了 这是我听过最棒的故事
Too cool!  That was the best, just the best.

764
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,765
后来呢？
Then what happened?

765
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:33,642
什么后来？ 后来怎么了？
What do you mean? I mean, what happened?

766
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,141
什么 “后来怎么了” ？ 这样就完了
What do you mean, "What happened?" That's the end.

767
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:40,217
怎么可以这样就结束？ 就算什么鸟结局？
How can that be the end? What kind of an ending is that?

768
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:41,948
猪臀后来有没有怎么样？
What happens to Lardass?

769
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:44,283
我也不知道
I don't know.

770
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:47,485
也许跑回家 吃一大堆起士汉堡庆祝一番吧
Maybe he went home and celebrated with a couple of cheeseburgers.

771
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,757
这样的结局太烂了
Jesus, that ending sucks.

772
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:54,428
你为什么不把它改一改 改成猪臀跑回家
Why don't you make it so that Lardass goes home...

773
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,298
拿枪杀了他老头
...and he shoots his father.

774
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,896
然后他到德州加入骑警队 这样的结束不错吧？
Then he runs away and he joins the Texas Rangers. How about that?

775
00:49:59,973 --> 00:50:01,804
我不知道
I don't know.

776
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,844
要是这样就完美无缺了
Something good Iike that.

777
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,608
我喜欢这个结局 全体大呕吐的部份最精彩
I Iike the ending. The barfing was good.

778
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:10,116
只是有件事我不明白
But there's one thing I didn't understand.

779
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:14,653
就是猪臀参加比赛 要不要交报名费？
Did Lardass have to pay to get into the contest?

780
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:18,592
不必，维恩 他们免费让他参加
No, Vern, they just Iet him in.

781
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,960
那就好，这故事真棒
Great, great story.

782
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:24,657
确实是个好故事，戈帝 只是结局差一点
It's a great story. I just didn't Iike the ending.

783
00:50:24,732 --> 00:50:27,428
维恩，收音机呢？ 听听看有没有什么消息
Where's the radio? Let's see if we can get some sounds.

784
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,799
在这里
Here.

785
00:50:37,312 --> 00:50:39,279
我们一直聊到深夜
We talked into the night.

786
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:43,011
说来说去 都是些言不及义的废话
The kind of talk thatseemed important until you discover girls.

787
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:47,284
好了，米老鼠是只老鼠 唐老鸭是只鸭子
All right. Mickey's a Mouse. Donald's a duck.

788
00:50:47,357 --> 00:50:50,655
布鲁托则是狗 谁知道古菲是什么动物？
Pluto's a dog. What's Goofy?

789
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,293
若我下半辈子只能吃一样东西 我会挑什么？
If I could only have one food for the rest of my Iife?

790
00:50:54,364 --> 00:50:56,798
太容易猜了，当然是猪肉
That's easy. Pez.

791
00:50:56,865 --> 00:50:59,959
用樱桃调味的猪肉 不用想也知道
Cherry flavoured Pez. No question about it.

792
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,302
古菲是只狗 绝对是只狗
Goofy's a dog. He's definitely a dog.

793
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:08,476
我想这猜谜游戏 一定有事先安排
I knew the $64,000 Question was fixed.

794
00:51:08,544 --> 00:51:11,809
没有人能猜到答案的
There's no way anybody can know that much about opera.

795
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:16,046
古菲不可能是狗 他戴帽子而且还开车
He can't be a dog. He wears a hat and drives a car.

796
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:19,820
篷车英雄真的很好看
Wagon Train is a really cool show...

797
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:22,619
可是你们有没有发现 他们始终走不到目的地
...but did you ever notice that they never get anywhere?

798
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:25,757
只是一直走个不停
They just keep wagon training.

799
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,890
真是古怪 古菲究竟是什么鬼玩意儿？
God, that's weird. What the hell is Goofy?

800
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:37,637
没有人提起雷布罗尔 但每个人其实都在想他的事
Not one of us mentioned Ray Brower, but we were all thinking about him.

801
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:46,947
我的妈 是布罗尔那小鬼
Oh, my God. It's the Brower kid.

802
00:51:47,018 --> 00:51:49,043
他的鬼魂在森林里游荡
His ghost is out walking in the woods.

803
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:54,088
我答应绝不卖色情书刊
I promise I won't hock no more dirty books.

804
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:55,922
也绝不敢再说话不算话
I promise I won't say no more bad swears.

805
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:58,259
我保证以后会把青豆吃光
I promise I'll eat my Iima beans.

806
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:00,698
你这胆小鬼
Two for flinching.

807
00:52:05,337 --> 00:52:06,769
那是什么，克利斯？
What is it, Chris?

808
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:09,598
可能是郊狼
Maybe it's coyotes.

809
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:11,767
听起来像女人的尖叫声
Sounds Iike a woman screaming.

810
00:52:11,844 --> 00:52:14,107
不是郊狼，是他的鬼魂
It's not coyotes. It's his ghost.

811
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:15,669
别胡说了
Don't say that.

812
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:17,614
泰迪，坐下
Teddy, sit down.

813
00:52:17,683 --> 00:52:20,117
我要去找它 看看他的鬼魂
I'm gonna go Iook for it. I want to see the ghost.

814
00:52:20,186 --> 00:52:22,245
别说了 我一定要去看看
Don't say that.

815
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:24,118
我真想看看他是什么样子
I just want to see it! I just want to see what he Iooks Iike.

816
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,929
也许我们该轮流站岗
Maybe we should stand guard.

817
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,793
好主意
That's a good idea.

818
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:42,440
把枪给我，我来站第一班
Give me the gun. I'll take the first watch.

819
00:52:55,222 --> 00:52:57,156
晚上十一点
23:00 hours.

820
00:52:57,224 --> 00:53:00,159
轮到泰迪杜强士官长担任警戒
Corporal Teddy Duchamp stands guard.

821
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:05,159
不见敌人踪迹
No sign of the enemy.

822
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:06,825
堡垒安全无虑
The fort is secure.

823
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:09,836
泰迪，闭嘴， 张大眼睛看守
Shut up, Teddy, and keep your eyes peeled.

824
00:53:18,913 --> 00:53:21,939
别搞了，泰迪 我们好不容易才快睡着
Cut it out.  I'm trying to sleep.

825
00:53:24,753 --> 00:53:27,347
兄弟们均已安然入睡
The dogfaces rested easy...

826
00:53:27,422 --> 00:53:30,186
他们知道有杜强士官长在
...in the knowledge that Corporal Teddy Duchamp...

827
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:33,695
可以高枕无忧
...was protecting all that was dear to them.

828
00:55:08,027 --> 00:55:09,619
死的应该是你，戈帝
It should have been you, Gordon.

829
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:14,021
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

830
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:18,469
你做梦了
You were dreaming.

831
00:55:29,383 --> 00:55:32,011
丹尼埋葬时我没有哭
I didn't cry at Denny's funeral.

832
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,825
我很想念他，克利斯
I miss him, Chris.

833
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:40,724
真的很想他
I really miss him.

834
00:55:42,062 --> 00:55:43,997
我知道
I know.

835
00:55:47,235 --> 00:55:48,667
继续睡吧
Go back to sleep.

836
00:56:30,113 --> 00:56:33,548
也许你可以和我一起 上升学班考大学
Maybe you could go into the college courses with me.

837
00:56:33,615 --> 00:56:35,049
除非太阳从西边出来
That'll be the day.

838
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:37,882
为什么不行？你头脑很好
Why not? You're smart enough.

839
00:56:37,954 --> 00:56:39,387
他们不会让我有这个机会的
They won't Iet me.

840
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,890
怎么说？
What do you mean?

841
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,828
镇上的人 打心眼里瞧不起我们家
It's the way the people think of my family in this town.

842
00:56:47,897 --> 00:56:50,889
他们也看不起我，我只是 詹伯斯家的另一个坏孩子
It's the way they think of me. I'm just one of those Iow life Chambers kids.

843
00:56:50,968 --> 00:56:53,060
这不是事实
That's not true.

844
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:55,229
事实就是如此
It is.

845
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:59,072
甚至没人问我真的偷了牛奶钱
No one asked me if I took the milk money.

846
00:56:59,143 --> 00:57:01,940
就一口咬定是我干的
I just got a three day vacation.

847
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:08,584
是不是你拿的？
Did you take it?

848
00:57:08,652 --> 00:57:10,085
是我
Yeah, I took it.

849
00:57:10,154 --> 00:57:12,247
你知道是我
You knew I took it.

850
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:14,257
泰迪也知道是我
Teddy knew I took it.

851
00:57:14,826 --> 00:57:16,588
大家都知道是我偷的
Everyone knew I took it.

852
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,925
我想甚至连维恩都知道
Even Vern knew, I think.

853
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,367
也许我会后悔又把那钱拿出来
Maybe I was sorry, and I tried to give it back.

854
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:28,264
你想把钱送回去？
You tried to give it back?

855
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,773
也许
Maybe,

856
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,433
只是也许
just maybe.

857
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,274
也许我还曾把钱送去给 西蒙丝小姐
Maybe I took it to Old Lady Simons

858
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:36,280
告诉她，一毛都不少
and told her, and the money was all there.

859
00:57:36,348 --> 00:57:40,115
但我仍被关了三天 因为那钱又不见了
But I still got a three day vacation, because it never showed up.

860
00:57:40,186 --> 00:57:41,949
也许过了一个星期
And maybe the next week, old Lady Simons...

861
00:57:42,021 --> 00:57:44,955
西蒙丝小姐 穿了件新裙子去学校
...had this brand new skirt on when she came to school.

862
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:48,618
不错，她穿了件 咖啡色有园点的新裙子
Yeah, it was brown and it had dots on it.

863
00:57:48,693 --> 00:57:51,788
你明白了吧 不错，我是偷了牛奶钱
Let's just say that I stole the milk money

864
00:57:51,863 --> 00:57:54,492
但西蒙丝小姐 又由我这儿把钱偷走了
but old Lady Simons stole it back from me.

865
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:57,627
但即使我说出来又怎么样
Just suppose that I told this story.

866
00:57:57,703 --> 00:58:00,638
我克利斯詹伯斯 大眼詹伯斯的老弟说的话
Me, Chris Chambers, kid brother to Eyeball Chambers.

867
00:58:00,706 --> 00:58:02,698
你想有人会相信吗？
Do you think anyone would have believed it?

868
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:06,975
如果换了别人 你想那个贱女人敢这样做吗
You think that bitch would have tried that if it had been one of those douche bags...

869
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:10,483
如果是那些有钱人的小孩偷的 她绝不敢这样
...from The View, if they had taken the money?

870
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,984
对，她一定不敢 就是
No way.  Hell, no.

871
00:58:13,053 --> 00:58:14,543
但对我呢？
But, with me....

872
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,824
我想她大概 一直很想买那件裙子
I'm sure she had her eye on that skirt for a long time.

873
00:58:23,897 --> 00:58:26,923
遇到了这个弄钱的机会 当然不会错过
Anyway, she saw her chance and she took it.

874
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,732
我真笨， 竟然想把钱送回去
I was the stupid one for even trying to give it back.

875
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:39,171
可是我绝没想到
I just never thought....

876
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:44,347
没想到一个老师会…
I never thought that a teacher....

877
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:49,186
我他妈的才不在乎
Who gives a fuck anyway?

878
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,195
现在我只有一个希望
I just wish...

879
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:01,861
就是能到一个 没有人认识我的地方
...that I could go someplace where nobody knows me.

880
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,542
我真没用，对不对？
I guess I'm just a pussy.

881
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,718
你不是
No way, man.

882
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,938
“黑帮克星”

883
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:07,269
火车吵醒了他们 我原想告诉他们
The freight woke up the other guys...

884
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:09,773
看见小鹿的事
...and it was on the tip of my tongue to tell them about the deer,

885
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,775
但又把话吞了回去
but I didn't.

886
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,778
我决定保存这个秘密
That was the one thing I kept to myself.

887
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:17,781
直到今天才把这件事说出来
I've neverspoken or written of it until just now.

888
01:00:25,023 --> 01:00:27,617
戈帝，你昨天 怎么不顺便买点早餐？
How come you didn't get some breakfast stuff like...

889
01:00:27,693 --> 01:00:31,630
例如面包，果酱和沙士
...Twinkies, and Pez, and root beer?

890
01:00:31,698 --> 01:00:34,292
真对不起，维恩 再能干的人
Sorry. I guess a more experienced shopper

891
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:37,029
也无法用你那七分钱 买回山珍海味
could've gotten more for your 7 cents.

892
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:42,306
大伙的肚子都饿得咕咕响 但我们还是走到了罗耶河
With ourstomachs rumbling, we pressed on toward the Royal River.

893
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:44,969
想到很快就可以看到布罗尔
The reality of Ray Brower was growing,

894
01:00:45,044 --> 01:00:47,309
我们浑汗加快脚步
and kept us moving despite the heat.

895
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:51,145
此时我心中想看 那具尸体的欲望
For me, the idea ofseeing that kid's dead body...

896
01:00:51,217 --> 01:00:53,482
也越来越强
...was starting to become an obsession.

897
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:07,826
各位，罗耶河就在眼前
Gentlemen, the Royal.

898
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:13,168
老天，铁路绕了个大弯
God, the tracks go way out of the way.

899
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,175
我们可以由这里穿过去 不用一个小时就可以到了
We cut across this field right here, we'll be there in an hour.

900
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:20,343
我觉得 还是顺着铁轨走比较保险
I think we should stick to the tracks.

901
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,348
我说我们就由这里穿过去
I say we go across the field.

902
01:01:23,218 --> 01:01:23,877
戈帝？
Gordie?

903
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:27,352
好吧 我们走
Yeah.  Let's go.

904
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:29,355
格杀勿论
Take no prisoners!

905
01:01:32,093 --> 01:01:34,857
安全第一，我们还是…
You guys, it's a lot safer if we....

906
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:38,362
快来呀
Come on, men. Let's take on the....

907
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:40,367
那片树林说不定有问题
You don't know what's in those woods.

908
01:01:42,438 --> 01:01:45,601
冲啊 等等我
Hey gaus,wait for me.

909
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:47,106
…那些狗辈
You guys, wait up for me!

910
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,045
大哥，我有件事告诉你
I gotta tell you something, but swear on your mother's name...

911
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,883
但你得以你妈的名誉发誓 不告诉别人
...that you won't tell anybody.

912
01:01:59,955 --> 01:02:01,388
我发誓，兄弟
You got it, pal.

913
01:02:03,793 --> 01:02:07,058
大眼，你记得 那个叫布罗尔的小鬼吗？
Eyeball, you know that Brower kid?

914
01:02:07,129 --> 01:02:08,722
他怎么了？
What about him?

915
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,733
我可以告诉你他的事
I'll tell you something, but you must swear on your mother's good name...

916
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:13,167
但你得以你妈的名誉发誓 不告诉别人
...you won't tell nobody.

917
01:02:13,236 --> 01:02:15,727
比利和查理很难得地 把这大秘密
Billy and Charlie had managed to keep their enormous secret

918
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:17,899
保存了3 6小时
for about 36 hours.

919
01:02:17,974 --> 01:02:19,908
这对他们 已是前所未有的纪录
A personal record for both of them.

920
01:02:19,976 --> 01:02:24,072
不到中午，艾斯和大眼 已把这秘密传遍全帮
By noon, Ace and Eyeball had told their secret to everybody in the gang.

921
01:02:24,147 --> 01:02:26,240
或许对他们而言 母亲的名誉
I guess for those guys, protecting their mother's good name

922
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:28,410
并不是太重要
wasn't a top priority.

923
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:30,419
艾斯，你听我说
Ace, maybe

924
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:32,581
我和查理还是别去比较好
me and Charlie shouldn't go.

925
01:02:32,657 --> 01:02:34,521
反正也不差我们两个，对吧？
Maybe you could go without us?

926
01:02:35,493 --> 01:02:38,427
你们俩真是婆婆妈妈 和我老祖母一模一样
You guys are acting like my grandmother having a conniption fit.

927
01:02:38,496 --> 01:02:40,088
我想不出有什么好怕的
I don't see your problem.

928
01:02:40,164 --> 01:02:43,793
我们带了全套的钓鱼用具 如果有条子盘问我们可以说…
We take a bunch of fishing gear, so if a cop asks us what we're doing:

929
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:47,964
“我们只是想钓几条呆头鱼 结果却…”
"We're here to take a couple of steelhead out of the river. Look what we found".

930
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,270
对啊，老兄 想想成名的滋味
Come on, man, we're gonna be famous.

931
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:54,277
我们会出现在 全国所有的电视和电台
We'll be on every radio and TV show in the country.

932
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:56,211
我还是觉得我们不去比较好
I still don't think we should go.

933
01:02:56,849 --> 01:02:59,180
好了，好了
Okay.

934
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:01,784
你们已经表示过你们的意见
You've stated your position clearly.

935
01:03:01,854 --> 01:03:04,448
现在该我说话了
Now, I'm gonna state mine.

936
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:06,889
你他妈的立刻给我滚上车
Get in the fucking car. Now!

937
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:08,483
快走，兄弟 对啊，我们走
Let's go, man.

938
01:03:22,374 --> 01:03:23,967
我不喜欢这条捷径
I hate this shortcut.

939
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:26,033
我不喜欢这条捷径
"I hate this shortcut".

940
01:03:28,047 --> 01:03:30,982
你害怕了，该揍两下
You flinched! Two for flinching.

941
01:03:34,722 --> 01:03:36,313
害怕的是你呀
But you flinched.

942
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:38,654
我知道，吓人的也要揍两下
I know. Two for flinching.

943
01:03:58,913 --> 01:04:00,848
现在我们要怎么过去？
How are we supposed to get across this?

944
01:04:00,915 --> 01:04:03,510
我们可以把你当成人筏 真好笑
We use you as a raft.  Very funny.

945
01:04:14,262 --> 01:04:17,026
其实水不深，我们可以走过去
It's not that deep. We can walk across.

946
01:04:27,275 --> 01:04:29,402
我早说我们该顺着铁路走
I told you we should have stuck to the tracks.

947
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:35,110
世界上最胆小的人是你还是我？
Is it me, or are you the world's biggest pussy?

948
01:04:35,952 --> 01:04:38,079
你大概觉得这样很有趣
I suppose this is fun for you.

949
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:40,451
不，这样才有趣
No, but this is.

950
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:43,989
要不要再来一点？
Want some more?

951
01:04:45,127 --> 01:04:47,561
住手，不来了 泰迪，别忘了你的年龄
Stop it, come on!  Act your age. This is my age.

952
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:51,727
这正是我这年龄该做的事 我一辈子只年轻一次
I'm in the prime of my youth, and I'll only be young once.

953
01:04:51,802 --> 01:04:54,326
不错，但你玩过了头 下半辈子就会变成一个蠢蛋
But you're going to be stupid for the rest of your Iife.

954
01:04:54,403 --> 01:04:56,235
你找死，詹伯斯 你死定了，詹伯斯
That's it, Chambers. You just signed your own death warrant.

955
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:00,274
死吧，詹伯斯
You die, Chambers!

956
01:05:04,815 --> 01:05:07,306
抓住他，抓住维恩
Get him, Chambers!

957
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:10,752
维恩怕他会死掉 泰迪，会死的是你
Vern's afraid he's gonna die!  Teddy, you're gonna die!

958
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:16,084
你想往哪儿跑，蓝强？
Where do you think you're going, Lachance?

959
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:18,525
别想溜，蓝强 你们别闹了
Come on, you guys.

960
01:05:19,663 --> 01:05:21,757
压下去，压住他
Pile on!

961
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,595
你们这些混球 我不想玩…
I don't want to do this.

962
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:26,000
压上去 别闹了
Get off!

963
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:30,603
这床垫不错 住手，我要生气了
Sleeper hold.  Stop it. I'm serious.

964
01:05:30,675 --> 01:05:33,439
大家都趴在床垫上
No one gets out of the sleeper hold.

965
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:35,274
维恩，你脖子上有个东西
Vern, there's something on your neck.

966
01:05:35,346 --> 01:05:37,473
少来，你以为这样 就可以把我骗下来，蓝强
I'm not falling for that one, Lachance.

967
01:05:37,548 --> 01:05:39,641
你脖子上真的有个东西
No, there is something on your neck.

968
01:05:39,717 --> 01:05:40,706
是水蛭
It's a Ieech. Leeches!

969
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:41,844
妈呀，有水蛭
Oh, my God!  Leeches!

970
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,352
老天爷
Oh, my God!

971
01:05:50,195 --> 01:05:51,492
天啊
Jesus Christ!

972
01:05:51,563 --> 01:05:52,996
天啊
Oh, my God!

973
01:05:57,771 --> 01:06:00,466
快把它们弄掉 滚下去
Get them off! Lay off me!

974
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:06,134
戈帝，你背上也有 快把它们弄走
Gordie, there's some on your back.  Get them off!

975
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:09,041
我身上还有没有？
Are there any on mine?

976
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,665
克利斯
Chris

977
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,227
我完了，克利斯
Oh, shit, Chris.

978
01:06:34,175 --> 01:06:35,608
可恶
Oh, shit, man.

979
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,794
戈帝，你还好吗？
Are you okay?

980
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:03,302
你听得见我吗？
Can you hear me?

981
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:07,303
戈帝，你还好吗？ 说不定他已经死了
Are you there? Maybe he's dead.

982
01:07:07,376 --> 01:07:09,537
他没死 他还在呼吸， 白痴
He's not dead. He's still breathing, idiot.

983
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:13,309
我怎么会知道 别吵了，他只是昏了过去
I don't know. Just cool it, you guys. He just fainted.

984
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,105
戈帝
Gordie

985
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:21,216
我从没看见过人家昏倒
I never met anybody who fainted before.

986
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:25,386
他可能是一时大意 看见的你的狗脸才晕倒
Maybe he made a bad mistake and looked at your face.

987
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:28,623
闭嘴，泰迪 你还好吧，戈帝？
Shut up, Teddy. You okay?

988
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:31,729
我没事 我们走吧
Yeah.  Let's go.

989
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:40,571
也许我们该送戈帝回去 得了，詹伯斯
Maybe we should take Gordie back.

990
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:43,737
怎么连你也变懦夫？ 你有毛病啊，杜强？
Great, Chambers, now you're turning pussy, too!

991
01:07:43,813 --> 01:07:45,906
水蛭咬了他的老二 而且他刚刚还晕倒
What's your problem? He had a leech on his balls. He fainted.

992
01:07:45,982 --> 01:07:47,916
你是他什么人，他妈吗？ 去吃屎
Are you his mother?

993
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:49,953
你才该去吃屎 嘿…
Eat shit.  You eat shit.

994
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:52,679
克利斯说得对 我们回去好了
I think Chris is right. Let's go back.

995
01:07:52,756 --> 01:07:54,417
真想不到啊
What a surprise!

996
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:56,288
胆小鬼之王要回去找妈妈了
The king of the pussies wants to go back, too.

997
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,021
少那样叫我
Stop calling me that.  What, "pussy"? Pussy!

998
01:07:58,095 --> 01:08:00,620
懦夫 住嘴
Stop it!  Pussy!

999
01:08:00,698 --> 01:08:02,130
你这个四眼神经病
You four eyed psycho!

1000
01:08:02,933 --> 01:08:04,333
放开我
Get off me!

1001
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:07,427
胆小的要揍两下 这两下没打错吧？
Two for flinching. Do I get two for flinching?

1002
01:08:07,505 --> 01:08:08,937
好了啦 别打了
Come on. --Stop it.

1003
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:10,598
你喜欢吗，泰迪？ 好了，别打了
You Iike it, Teddy?  Break it up.

1004
01:08:10,675 --> 01:08:13,269
别打了 住手！
Come on, you guys. Break it up.  Stop it!

1005
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:24,719
我不要回去
I'm not going back.

1006
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:31,458
白痴 闭嘴，智障
Idiot.  Shut up! Retard.

1007
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:40,464
我不知道自己为什么 那么想去看那孩子的尸体
At the time, I didn't know why I needed to see that body so badly.

1008
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:42,473
但当时即使没人陪着我
Even if no one had followed me,

1009
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:44,475
我也会一个人去
I would have gone on alone.

1010
01:08:57,256 --> 01:09:00,055
别做梦，艾斯，这次别想赢我
No way, Ace! Not this time, man. No way!

1011
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:02,889
你想比赛吗？ 比就比，艾斯
Go for it, Vince.  You want to race?

1012
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:15,898
我赢过他了
Oh, my God, I got him.

1013
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:20,609
你已经过气了，老兄 过气了
You are history. History!

1014
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:23,411
退后一点，艾斯 行了，不用拼命
Fall back, Ace.  Don't fuck around.

1015
01:09:26,821 --> 01:09:29,381
老天，艾斯，退后一点
Jesus Christ, Ace! Fall back, man!

1016
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,515
艾斯，退到后面
Come on, man,Fall back!

1017
01:09:45,607 --> 01:09:47,471
天啊，我死定了
Shit, man! Shit!

1018
01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:49,543
我赢了
I won.

1019
01:09:50,846 --> 01:09:53,542
你输了，没用的家伙
You let him beat you, you cock knocker.

1020
01:10:03,626 --> 01:10:06,220
穿过这树林 我敢说至少节省了一小时
Coming though the woods, I bet we saved over an hour.

1021
01:10:09,632 --> 01:10:10,620
泰迪
Teddy.

1022
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,395
什么事？
Yeah?

1023
01:10:12,468 --> 01:10:14,401
这就是后哈洛路吗？
Is this the Back Harlow Road?

1024
01:10:15,805 --> 01:10:17,295
对
Yeah.

1025
01:10:17,373 --> 01:10:19,568
布罗尔的尸体一定就在这附近
The Brower kid must be around here someplace.

1026
01:10:19,642 --> 01:10:21,906
泰迪，你和维恩找铁路左边
Teddy and Vern watch the Ieft side of the tracks.

1027
01:10:21,978 --> 01:10:23,741
我们找右边 好的
We'll take the right.  All right.

1028
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:40,122
他在那里，我看见他了，看 ！
There he is! I see him! Look!

1029
01:10:40,197 --> 01:10:42,757
你看那里，我发现他了
Look over there! I see him!

1030
01:10:45,169 --> 01:10:46,830
我们都屏住了呼吸
None of us could breathe.

1031
01:10:47,671 --> 01:10:51,335
雷布罗尔的尸体 就在那树丛里
Somewhere under those bushes was the rest of Ray Brower.

1032
01:11:04,022 --> 01:11:06,115
雷布罗尔被火车撞得血肉模糊
The train had knocked Ray out of his Keds...

1033
01:11:06,191 --> 01:11:09,126
也夺走了他的生命
...just like it had knocked the Iife out of his body.

1034
01:11:09,194 --> 01:11:10,456
天啊
Jesus.

1035
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:14,327
这孩子不是生病
The kid wasn'tsick.

1036
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:16,163
也不是在睡觉
The kid wasn'tsleeping.

1037
01:11:17,369 --> 01:11:18,894
而是死了
The kid was dead.

1038
01:11:34,387 --> 01:11:36,321
大家找些长点的树枝来
Let's look for some long branches.

1039
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:38,824
给他做个担架
We'll build him a stretcher.

1040
01:11:51,338 --> 01:11:52,327
戈帝？
Gordie?

1041
01:12:00,914 --> 01:12:02,678
你为什么要死？
Why did you have to die?

1042
01:12:03,851 --> 01:12:06,444
戈帝怎么回事？ 没什么
What's the matter with Gordie? Nothing.

1043
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,182
你们两个去那边 找些树枝来，好吗？
You guys just go over there and look for some branches?

1044
01:12:09,256 --> 01:12:10,689
好的
Okay.

1045
01:12:22,603 --> 01:12:25,367
他为什么要死，克利斯？
Why did he have to die, Chris?

1046
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,035
丹尼为什么要死？为什么？
Why did Denny have to die? Why?

1047
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,378
我不知道
I don't know.

1048
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:36,213
该死的是我 别这么说
It should have been me.  Don't say that.

1049
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,584
该死的是我 别胡说
It should have been me.  Don't say that, man.

1050
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,222
我一无是处
I'm no good.

1051
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,225
我爸说的，我一无是处
My dad said it. I'm no good.

1052
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,885
那是因为他不了解你
He doesn't know you.

1053
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:50,891
他恨我 他不恨你
He hates me. He doesn't hate you.

1054
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:54,562
他恨我 他只是不了解你而已
He hates me.  No. He just doesn't know you.

1055
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:58,231
他恨我，我的爸爸恨我
He hates me. My dad hates me.

1056
01:12:59,309 --> 01:13:02,244
他恨我，我一无是处
He hates me. Oh, God.

1057
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:28,433
以后你会成为一个大作家，戈帝
You're gonna be a great writer someday.

1058
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:34,273
你说不定还会写我们的事 万一你找不到题材的话
You might even write about us guys, if you ever get hard up for material.

1059
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:56,297
那我一定是江O才尽了 才会这么做
I guess I'd have to be pretty hard up?

1060
01:13:58,036 --> 01:13:59,469
对
Yeah.

1061
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,339
你们怎么会知道这件事？
What the fuck do you know about this?

1062
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:08,976
他妈的，是我弟弟
Son of a bitch! My Iittle brother.

1063
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:14,409
你该不会想要由我们手上 抢走这尸体吧，小朋友？
You wasn't planning on taking the body from us, was you, boys?

1064
01:14:16,556 --> 01:14:19,719
滚一边去，是我们先发现他的 我们有权把他带走
You get away. We found him. We got dibs.

1065
01:14:21,227 --> 01:14:24,196
我们快逃吧，大眼 他们有权利呢
We better start running, Eyeball. They got dibs.

1066
01:14:24,263 --> 01:14:26,322
应该由我们得到他，老兄 你们开车来
We earned him. You guys came in a car.

1067
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,095
不公平，他该归我们
That's not fair. He's ours.

1068
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:30,765
不公平，他该归我们
"That's not fair. He's ours".

1069
01:14:30,837 --> 01:14:32,100
你休想
Well, not anymore.

1070
01:14:32,172 --> 01:14:34,003
我们有四个人，大眼
There are four of us, Eyeball.

1071
01:14:34,074 --> 01:14:35,597
你们还是识相点快滚
You just make your move.

1072
01:14:35,676 --> 01:14:37,906
我们会走的，别急
We will. Don't you worry.

1073
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:45,383
维恩，你这小王八蛋
Vern, you little son of a whore.

1074
01:14:45,452 --> 01:14:46,680
你在地板下偷听到这件事
You was under the porch.

1075
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:48,847
没有，我发誓和我无关
No, I swear it wasn't me.

1076
01:14:48,922 --> 01:14:50,514
你这爱窥人隐私的小肥猪
You keyhole peeping bung.

1077
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:52,718
我一定要打得你屁滚尿流
I ought to beat the living shit out of you.

1078
01:14:59,434 --> 01:15:01,368
你们有两个选择
You guys have two choices.

1079
01:15:02,437 --> 01:15:05,201
一个是乖乖的滚蛋 把他交给我们
Either leave quietly and we take the body...

1080
01:15:05,273 --> 01:15:08,140
一个是留下来 让我们好好揍一顿
...or you stay and we beat the shit out of you.

1081
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:10,376
然后我们一样要把他带走
And we take the body.

1082
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:12,208
再说，是我和比利先发现他的
Besides, me and Billy found him first.

1083
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,215
维恩已经告诉我们 你们是怎么发现他的
Vern told us how you found him.

1084
01:15:14,283 --> 01:15:17,878
比利 要是我们没有偷那辆车就好了
"Billy, I wish we'd never boosted that car".

1085
01:15:17,952 --> 01:15:21,911
比利，我觉得 我害怕得不知如何是好
"Billy, I think I just turned my Fruit of the Looms into fudge factory".

1086
01:15:21,991 --> 01:15:24,482
我要把你的屁股打开花 等等
That's it. Your ass is grass!  Hold it.

1087
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:29,927
詹伯斯，你这小杂碎
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot.

1088
01:15:29,999 --> 01:15:32,229
再给你最后一次机会
This is your Iast chance.

1089
01:15:33,135 --> 01:15:34,568
你怎么说，小鬼？
What do you say, kid?

1090
01:15:36,305 --> 01:15:39,139
你为什么 不滚回家去吃你老娘的奶？
Why don't you go home and fuck your mother some more?

1091
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:45,413
你死定了
You're dead.

1092
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:47,672
克利斯，我们快溜吧
Come on, let's split.

1093
01:15:48,485 --> 01:15:50,475
他们别想带他走 老哥，这样做太疯狂了
They're not taking him.  Come on, this is crazy.

1094
01:15:50,553 --> 01:15:53,317
我绝不让他们带他走 可是他手上有刀
They're not taking him.  He's got a knife, man.

1095
01:15:54,324 --> 01:15:55,951
艾斯，算了吧
Ace, come on.

1096
01:16:00,664 --> 01:16:02,360
你得先杀了我，艾斯
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

1097
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,094
没问题
No problem.

1098
01:16:18,015 --> 01:16:19,607
你别想带他走
You're not taking him.

1099
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:21,515
谁都别想带他走
Nobody's taking him.

1100
01:16:23,354 --> 01:16:27,382
小鬼，把抢给我 然后赶快逃命
Come on, kid, just give me the gun before you take your foot off.

1101
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,193
你连只老鼠都不敢杀
You ain't got the sack to shoot a woodchuck.

1102
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:34,888
别动，艾斯
Don't move, Ace.

1103
01:16:35,701 --> 01:16:38,363
我会杀你的，我对天发誓
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

1104
01:16:40,037 --> 01:16:42,232
得了，蓝强，把枪给我
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.

1105
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:47,407
你至少也该学到一点 你哥哥的长处
You must have at least some of your brother's good sense.

1106
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,984
有种放马过来
Suck my fat one,

1107
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:57,419
你这欺善怕恶的人渣
you cheap dime store hood.

1108
01:17:03,396 --> 01:17:05,023
你打算怎样？ 难道把我们全杀了？
What are you going to do, shoot us all?

1109
01:17:06,065 --> 01:17:07,498
不，艾斯
No,Ace.

1110
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:09,228
我只杀你一个
Just you.

1111
01:17:19,078 --> 01:17:20,944
我们会找你讨回这笔债的
We're gonna get you for this.

1112
01:17:21,582 --> 01:17:23,516
你们未必能占得到便宜
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

1113
01:17:24,418 --> 01:17:25,851
会的
We will.

1114
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:41,561
你别想我们会随随便便就算了
We're not going to forget this, if that's what you're thinking.

1115
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,796
这个仇我们一定要报，小娃娃
This is big time, baby.

1116
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:03,253
试试你的胆子有多大？
"Suck my fat one"?

1117
01:18:04,325 --> 01:18:06,987
你的胆子有多大，蓝强？
Whoever told you, you had a fat one, Lachance?

1118
01:18:08,798 --> 01:18:11,289
我胆大号称天下第一
Biggest one in four counties.

1119
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,399
是，才怪
Yeah

1120
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:30,676
我们要不要把他带走？
Are we going to take him?

1121
01:18:31,221 --> 01:18:32,346
不
No.

1122
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:38,324
可是我们走了大老远才到这里 我们可以成为英雄的
But we came all this way? We're supposed to be heroes.

1123
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:42,590
这样不是真英雄，泰迪
Not this way, Teddy.

1124
01:18:45,836 --> 01:18:48,464
克利斯，帮我个忙
Chris, give me a hand.

1125
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,274
警察后来找到了尸体
Ray Brower's body was found...

1126
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:55,779
但我们两帮人都没出锋头
...but neither our gang nor their gang got the credit.

1127
01:18:55,847 --> 01:18:58,280
因为最后我们觉得
We decided that

1128
01:18:58,348 --> 01:19:00,783
打匿名电话报警最好
an anonymous phone call was the best thing to do.

1129
01:19:06,357 --> 01:19:07,790
在回家的路上
We headed home.

1130
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:10,794
尽管每个人心里 都思潮汹涌
And although many thoughts raced through our minds...

1131
01:19:10,862 --> 01:19:12,295
大家却都很少开口
...we barely spoke.

1132
01:19:16,535 --> 01:19:19,128
我们彻夜赶路 终于在周日
We walked all night and made it back to Castle Rock...

1133
01:19:19,203 --> 01:19:23,640
早晨五点过后回到岩城 那天是工人节的前一天
...a Iittle past 5:00 on Sunday morning, the day before Labour Day.

1134
01:19:25,376 --> 01:19:27,470
我们只离开了两天
We'd only been gone two days,

1135
01:19:27,546 --> 01:19:29,980
但回来时 都觉得这个小镇变了
butsomehow the town seemed different...

1136
01:19:30,048 --> 01:19:31,481
变得更小
...smaller.

1137
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,328
开学时再见了
See you in school.

1138
01:19:52,405 --> 01:19:53,997
好
Yeah.

1139
01:19:55,508 --> 01:19:57,669
上中学时再见
See you in Junior High.

1140
01:20:11,424 --> 01:20:12,756
一分钱
Penny.

1141
01:20:21,435 --> 01:20:25,702
好了，我最好在我妈把我 列入十大要犯名单前回家
I better get home, before my mom puts me on the "10 Most Wanted List".

1142
01:20:33,949 --> 01:20:36,247
克利斯
Chris.

1143
01:20:36,318 --> 01:20:38,218
别放在心上，好吗？
No hard feelings, okay?

1144
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,916
不会的，兄弟
No way, man.

1145
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,226
∮ 快枪利眼闯过惊涛骇浪

1146
01:20:49,297 --> 01:20:54,257
∮ 赤手空拳不畏龙潭虎穴

1147
01:20:54,337 --> 01:20:56,566
∮ 身怀单枪会遍英雄好汉

1148
01:21:04,981 --> 01:21:08,577
后来我们跟泰迪和维恩 越来越少来往
As time went on we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern...

1149
01:21:08,651 --> 01:21:12,587
最后他们变成 只是我们生命中的过客
...until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls.

1150
01:21:12,655 --> 01:21:14,418
这种事是难免的
It happens sometimes.

1151
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:17,654
有些朋友常是一闪而逝 就像路上的行人一样
Friends come in and out ofyourlife like busboys in a restaurant.

1152
01:21:18,829 --> 01:21:21,263
听说维恩中学毕业不久 就结了婚
I heard that Vern got married out of high school, had four kids...

1153
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:25,927
生了四个孩子 现在林场操作起重机
...and is now the forklift operator at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.

1154
01:21:26,003 --> 01:21:28,267
泰迪一直想加入陆军
Teddy tried to getinto the Army,

1155
01:21:28,338 --> 01:21:31,102
但因视力及听力问题 而未能如愿
but his eyes and his ear kept him out.

1156
01:21:31,174 --> 01:21:33,267
据说他后来坐过一阵子牢
Last I'd heard he'd spentsome time in jail...

1157
01:21:33,343 --> 01:21:36,107
现在岩城附近打零工
...and was now doing oddjobs around Castle Rock.

1158
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:47,491
我永远也无法离开这个地方 是不是，戈帝？
I'm never gonna get out of this town, am I, Gordie?

1159
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,851
你可以做到任何你想做的事
You can do anything you want, man.

1160
01:21:52,864 --> 01:21:54,627
是的
Yeah.

1161
01:21:54,699 --> 01:21:56,132
当然
Sure.

1162
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,870
握一下手
Give me some skin.

1163
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:16,218
我会来找你
I'll see you.

1164
01:22:16,288 --> 01:22:18,313
我会先去找你
Not if I see you first.

1165
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:24,393
克利斯后来终于离开了小镇
Chris did get out.

1166
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:27,159
他和我一起上大学先修班
He enrolled in the college courses with me.

1167
01:22:27,232 --> 01:22:30,828
虽然功课很重 但他拿出那股狠劲拼命用功
And although it was hard, he gutted it outlike he always did.

1168
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,896
顺利进了大学 并成为执业律师
He went on to college and eventually became a lawyer.

1169
01:22:34,808 --> 01:22:37,675
上个星期 他到一家快餐店吃饭时
Last week, he entered a fast food restaurant.

1170
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:40,679
前面的两个男人 一言不合吵了起来
Just ahead of him, two men gotinto an argument.

1171
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,681
其中一个还拔出了刀子
One of them pulled a knife.

1172
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,684
一向很会做和事佬的克利斯 上前劝架
Chris, who'd always made the bestpeace, tried to break it up.

1173
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,854
结果喉咙被刺了一刀
He was stabbed in the throat.

1174
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:50,856
当场死亡
He died almost instantly.

1175
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:55,960
“结果喉咙被刺了一刀 当场死亡”

1176
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:59,022
“虽然我和他已十年不见”

1177
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:04,538
“我知道我会永远怀念他”

1178
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:13,213
爸，可不可以走了？
Dad, can we go now?

1179
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,716
你准备好了吗？ 我们一个小时前就准备好了
You ready?  We've been ready for an hour.

1180
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:21,884
好，我马上来
I'll be right there.

1181
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:23,548
他半小时前也是那么说
He said that a half hour ago.

1182
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:26,889
我爸是个怪人 一写起文章就是这副德性
My dad's weird. He gets like that when he's writing.

1183
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:48,883
“我后来再也没交到”

1184
01:23:48,951 --> 01:23:54,753
“像十二岁时 那帮人一样好的朋友”

1185
01:23:54,824 --> 01:23:58,954
“也许每个人都是如此吧”

1186
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:34,290
“根据史帝芬金小说”尸体“改编”
