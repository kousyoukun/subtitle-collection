00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,233
[Sound of crowd cheering]

2
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:36,759
[Groans softly]

3
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,626
[Dog barking in distance]

4
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:31,985
[Indistinct chatter in Russian]

5
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:57,336
[Crowd cheering]

6
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,610
[Both grunting]

7
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:37,417
[Crowd cheering]

8
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,689
[Referee speaks Russian]

9
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:53,188
- [Bell dings]
- [Crowd cheering]

10
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:25,345
[Crowd cheering, stomping in unison]

11
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,202
Yeah. We got this.

12
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:51,458
[Max] ...Here at
the mgm grand tonight, Roy.

13
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:55,163
And, you know, when Adonis creed
lost to "pretty" Ricky conlan,

14
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,919
he was really a curiosity
more than anything else.

15
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,500
But that was an epic fight,

16
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:02,428
and since then,
he's reeled off six straight wins,

17
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:06,632
and tonight attempts against
Danny "the stuntman" Wheeler

18
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,389
to become the heavyweight champion
of the world.

19
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:14,148
It bears mentioning that
creed actually wagered his mustang

20
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,646
before their sparring session, Roy.

21
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:20,571
[Roy] And rumor has it that same mustang
is on the line again tonight.

22
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:23,945
[Duran] Okay, everybody out. Let's go.

23
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,155
- Hey.
- Hey.

24
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,286
- Feel good?
- Mmm-hmm.

25
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:35,915
Yeah. Remember to
keep your right hand up, okay?

26
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:37,606
His left is just as strong as his right.

27
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,540
Yep. Yeah.

28
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,885
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Okay, good.

29
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,232
It's just another fight, okay?

30
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:00,853
You got this.

31
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,539
[Rocky] You know,
there's only three steps into that ring.

32
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,874
Just three.

33
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:23,174
And tonight, it's gonna
look as high as a mountain.

34
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,970
And when you climb through them ropes,

35
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:31,429
it's gonna be
the loneliest place in the world

36
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,681
because you're gonna be in there
with another fighter

37
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:35,766
who wants to take you out.

38
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,898
So now, you gotta ask yourself,

39
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:42,064
are you here to prove something
to other people

40
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:45,988
or prove something to yourself?

41
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:51,528
[Adonis] To myself.

42
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,160
Right.

43
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,500
Now, let me ask you something.

44
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:58,588
What?

45
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:01,507
What's with the hair?

46
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:05,217
I combed it. It's a special night.

47
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,925
Shouldn't you be thinking about
something else, wise guy?

48
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:12,553
[Adonis exhales]

49
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:14,180
Now, you can go prove it.

50
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:17,975
Now go get your mustang back.

51
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,351
[Crowd cheering]

52
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,402
[Max] These guys have really
been mixing it up here in the fourth.

53
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:26,651
So far, creed's youth
outweighing Wheeler's experience.

54
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,858
Let's go! Let's go, baby. Let's go!

55
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:32,240
[Max] Maybe the most amazing part
of Adonis creed's journey, Roy...

56
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:33,912
Don't drop that guard! Sit.

57
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,143
[Max] ...Is that tonight, he fights...

58
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,247
Keep your hands up!

59
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,021
[Max] ...For the same belt held by
both his trainer, rocky balboa,

60
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,878
and his father, the great Apollo creed.

61
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:43,213
[Crowd exclaims] “Whoo!

62
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,508
[Max] Wheeler seems to be waking up.
We've seen this before, Roy.

63
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,803
When Wheeler smells blood,
he really turns it on.

64
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,140
[High-pitched whining]

65
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:57,723
[Rocky muffled] Come on back.

66
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:01,189
[Muffled crowd cheering]

67
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,064
[Takes deep breath]

68
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,655
Come on, d!

69
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,342
[Max] Three years ago,
that's a knockout.

70
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,073
Wheeler's power just isn't the same,
and no doubt creed can sense it.

71
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,364
You got him. Stay on him!

72
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,576
[Max] Creed's on a mission,
really pressing the issue now.

73
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:22,627
And a big left hook lands flush!

74
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:26,624
[Roy] Creed staying in the pocket, Max.
Moving, not running.

75
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,091
Come on, now! Hands up! Hands up!

76
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,420
[Max] These two men
are really going at it.

77
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:32,515
Tell him, Donnie!

78
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:34,619
[Roy] Another left hook
drives Wheeler back.

79
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:35,678
Come on, baby!

80
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,928
[Max] That was a sneaky little uppercut
on the inside,

81
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,559
and Wheeler's hurt by that, Roy.

82
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,410
[Roy] Yeah, that wobbled
his legs pretty bad.

83
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,380
- [Max] Another big shot!
- Hold him, hold him, hold him!

84
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,110
[Roy] Creed has him in trouble, Max.

85
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:48,637
[Max] Wheeler's doing what he can...

86
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,529
[Crowd cheering]
“Wheeler is down!

87
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,905
Wheeler has hit the canvas!

88
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,702
Now stay there, boy!

89
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,155
Creed taught you!

90
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,660
Come and give me my keys!

91
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,784
Get up! Come on, baby!

92
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:03,163
Get up, get up!

93
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:05,233
- [Max] Wheeler, trying to get up.
- [Referee] One!

94
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:06,377
- Stay down!
- [Referee] Two!

95
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,194
[Max] I don't know
if he makes this count, Roy.

96
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,218
[Referee] Three!

97
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:10,713
Four!

98
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:12,423
Five!

99
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:13,848
Six!

100
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:15,891
Seven!

101
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:17,184
Eight!

102
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:18,929
Ninel

103
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,935
that's it. That's it.

104
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,013
- [Bell dings]
- [Roy] And it's over, Max.

105
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,144
No way! Adonis creed...

106
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:27,184
Give me my keys!

107
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,611
[Max] ...Is the heavyweight champion
of the world.

108
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,406
You know what you just did?

109
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:34,653
Yeanh.

110
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,781
Baby, you know what just happened?

111
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:38,612
[Panting]

112
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,114
[All cheering]

113
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:44,042
When you think of
where this kid has come from,

114
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,337
the most unlikely beginning
for a fighter, Roy.

115
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:49,544
Growing up the way he did

116
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,626
to make it to the
top of boxing in this way...

117
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,006
It's unprecedented!

118
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:56,053
[Crowd chanting] Creed! Creed! Creed!

119
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:58,803
[Max] It's one thing
to be the number one contender.

120
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:01,931
It's a whole other thing to be champion.

121
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:04,434
[Crowd cheering and continues chanting]

122
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:08,688
[Max] This is the first step
to building a legacy of his own,

123
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,398
and I can hardly wait to see
what's next for Adonis creed.

124
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,114
[Rocky] Whoa.

125
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:20,863
I mean, what do you think?

126
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:22,284
[Chuckles] That's...

127
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,990
That is beautiful.

128
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,291
Right? Yeah.

129
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:26,378
But we gotta hurry up.

130
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:28,149
I mean, she's about to
get out the shower any second.

131
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,539
Yo, Donnie, why didn't you
tell me about this before?

132
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:31,861
I didn't know if I was gonna win.

133
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:33,466
What's that got to do with it?

134
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:34,880
I don't know.

135
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:37,462
Look, just tell me what I should do.

136
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,969
You get down on one knee.

137
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:41,558
People still do that shit?

138
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,385
You can always send her a text.

139
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,971
Come on, unc,
I'm being serious, all right?

140
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,306
I mean, what did you say?

141
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
- To Adrian?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:50,271
It was a long time ago.

143
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:53,478
We were at the zoo.
It was winter. It was snowing.

144
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:55,439
Everything smelled fresh.

145
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:58,692
There was this tiger.
He had snow on its back.

146
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:02,028
- And he's walking in the background.
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

147
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,488
Just tell me what you said.

148
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,164
Well, I was getting to that part.

149
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:06,332
What I said is...

150
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,082
I asked if she would not mind
marrying me very much,

151
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:13,757
which is kind of a dumb way
of saying she's my world,

152
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:17,093
and she made me better
than I deserved to be.

153
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:19,511
You know?

154
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,099
Yeanh.

155
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:26,144
Listen, why don't you
just turn off your brain

156
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,062
and let your heart do the talking.

157
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:29,848
Click.

158
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:32,525
You'll do good.

159
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:34,860
Turn my brain off? Yeah.

160
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:37,234
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

161
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,816
- All right.
- All right.

162
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:41,488
All right, I'm on it.

You good?

165
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,257
Yeah, real good. Thank you.

Listen, b.

174
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:44,798
I know we've been
dating for a few years now,

175
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:46,884
and it's just something about us
that just click.

176
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:49,852
I don't know how to explain it,

177
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,728
but the feeling I get
when you're by my side is a feeling

178
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:54,933
that I can't live without.

179
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:59,980
I know I sound crazy, but, look,
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

Remind me.

195

[Bianca] You ever thought
about going back to la?

Please, you're a Philly girl.

Yeah, I guess,

226
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,420
but it'd be nice to have more space.

everything I could in Philly, you know?

that's for sure.

a few times.

But I'd hang up every time
he was about to pick up

240

because, to tell you the truth,
I didn't know what to say to him.

and I'm like this chunk of yesterday
trying to be today?

You don't know?

280
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:37,164
Ukrainian boxer Viktor drago
appeared today in Philadelphia

281
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:38,998
to issue a very public challenge

282
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:42,551
to recently crowned
heavyweight champion Adonis creed.

283
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:46,631
A press conference was held earlier
by boxing promoter buddy marcelle.

284
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,809
We came all the way to Philly
to let you know it's serious.

Now, this man here,
he ain't no Danny Wheeler.

286
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:56,687
And let's be honest, creed fought him
three years too late, anyway.

287
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:58,438
Easy match.

288
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,812
[Ivan] People in this country love you.

289
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,491

[sighs] No one touch drago name.

291
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,574
Everything changed that night.

292
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,710
Look, you know, that's like

293
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:19,504
a million years ago.

294
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:22,963
Like yesterday to me.

295
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:26,554
So, you came all the way
over here to tell me that?

296
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:30,675
[Reporter on TV] It's no coincidence
that Ivan drago's son shows up

297
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,637
right after Apollo creed's son
claims the belt

298
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:36,188
this is creed versus drago.

299
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:39,267
This is the fight
the whole world wants to see.

300
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:41,227
And this is the fight he should take.

301
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,238
Unless he's afraid of
history repeating itself.

302
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:47,742
[Cohn] That history
being the infamous 1985 match

303
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:51,787
in which boxing legend Apollo creed
was killed by Russian fighter

304
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:53,034
Ivan drago.

305
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,663
Apollo's trainer rocky balboa
was heavily criticized

306
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:58,335
for failing to stop that fight.

307
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,876
[Bianca] D. Baby.

308
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:04,587
It's a publicity stunt.

309
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:09,262
Don't worry about that.

310
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,470
[Cohn] And let's not forget,

311
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,896
later that year, balboa defeated drago
in his own backyard, Russia.

312
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:20,525
[Ivan] Because of you,
I lose everything.

313
00:22:22,363 --> 00:22:23,363
Country.

314
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:25,615

Wife.

316
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,499
You ever see stray dogs in Ukraine?

317
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:38,951
They go for days with no food.

318
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:41,708
People spit on them. They have nothing.

319
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,834
No home.

320
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:46,630
Only will to survive, to fight.

321
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,639
I have son.

322
00:22:58,566 --> 00:22:59,851
All he knows

323
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:02,193
is this.

324
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:10,824
My son will break your boy.

325
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,577
Been a long day.

326
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,206
I think we're done here.

327
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:22,794
Because around here we put strays away.

[Grunting]

332
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:01,167
I kind of figured you'd be here.

333
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:05,079
You know, I tried calling and calling,
but nobody picked up or anything.

334
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:12,929
Kind of early to be training,
don't you think, after a fight?

335
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:14,255
Just trying to clear my head.

336
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:16,594
[Rocky] I get that.

337
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:19,389
Cheaper than a shrink, that's for sure.

[Continues grunting]

339

Hey, Don, come on.
I heard what's going on.

340
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,559
But you can't let them get inside.

341
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:29,896
But I know how you're feeling.

342
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:32,906
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

343
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:37,661
What happened a long time ago,
that ain't got nothing to do with you.

344
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:43,876
Listen, that fight is
what Apollo wanted, all right?

345
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:45,536
It shouldn't have happened.

346
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:47,048
But it did.

347
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,292
And you gotta let it go.

348
00:24:52,972 --> 00:24:53,972
Come on.

You've seen him fight, though?

351
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:03,311
I've seen him on sports TV
and stuff like that.

352
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,815
He's big, but he's raw.

353
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:10,565
He ain't no mean machine like you are,
that's for sure.

354
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,490
You know what?

I'm gonna cheer you up,

'cause I'm gonna hold the bag,
lucky guy.

- No, you're the one who's lucky.
- How's that?

'Cause I'm gonna let you

Choice?

436
00:29:47,683 --> 00:29:49,799
That's the same thing your father said,

It's a lot different.

that guy broke things in me

00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:33,183
that ain't never been fixed.

455
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,184
It's not worth it.

456
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:40,982
Not at all.

457
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:45,020
Why do you wanna fight?

458
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:47,677
What are you talking about?
I just told you why.

459
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:48,816
No, you didn't, Donnie.

460
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:50,859
Why do you wanna fight?

461
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:54,238
I get why they wanna fight you.
I know what they're fighting for.

462
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,368
What about you?

463
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:59,326
Listen to me,
you got everything to lose.

464
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:00,831
He's got nothing to lose.

465
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:03,289
When a fighter ain't got
nothing to lose, he's dangerous.

466
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:04,498
I'm dangerous!

467
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,925
You think I'm gonna lose.

468
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:16,560
I didn't say that.

469
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,476
Same guy that said
he ain't have enough experience.

470
00:31:21,485 --> 00:31:23,567
- Raw, right?
- Yeah.

471
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,775
But you don't think I could beat him.

472
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,427
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- No.

473
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:30,595
No, that's not what I'm saying.

474
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,826
I'm saying
I'm not gonna be here forever.

475
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:34,182
And what's that supposed to mean?

476
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:36,242
That means you gotta
do some smart thinking.

477
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,173
Oh, you wanna talk about
smart decisions, rock?

478
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:41,372
You in this house all alone.

479
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,828
Who been taking care of you? Me.

480
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,625
I've been here for you!

481
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:47,424
Who else you got?

482
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:54,308
Listen.

483
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,261
I'm taking this fight
with or without you.

484
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:12,112
It's gotta be without.

485
00:32:13,162 --> 00:32:14,447
I can't do it.

486
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:16,073
So that's it?

You walkin' out on me?

488
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:24,765
At least you ain't gotta worry about
throwing in the towel this time.

00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:09,001
Rocky, man.

Rocky what?

499
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,369
He ain't training me for the fight.

500
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,970
Wait, you're taking the fight?

501
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:17,639
All the shit that we've been through.

502
00:33:17,726 --> 00:33:19,933
He gonna leave me high and dry.
That's bullshit!

503
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,219
I took care of him when he had cancer.

504
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:23,770
He could've been dead, b.

505
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:25,438
I'm sure he has his reasons.

506

Oh, yeah? Like what?

I don't need him.

Yo.

511
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,540
I love it.

Me, too.

513
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,583
I want just a little piece of that room
for a studio.

514

That works. It's all you.

What's wrong?

516
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:42,328
I don't know. Maybe I'm just
a little tired from the flight.

517
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:43,352
I'm okay.

518
00:34:43,437 --> 00:34:44,552
We don't have to go out.

519
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:46,762
We can just stay in, order some food.

Hello. [Exclaims]

Yeah, it's great. The record label
really hit the ground running, too.

you always wanted kids, right?

What else is there to say?

593
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:07,447
So, that doesn't bother you?

Oh, you think this doesn't bother me?

You're a grown man.

It doesn't matter
what I or anyone else thinks.

You wanna fight this man,
that's your business.

And don't pretend
that it's about your father.

608
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:43,892
You became the world champion
without him.

Then why don't I feel like it?

610
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:51,074
If your father was here, he would
tell you he didn't feel like it either.

No, I am not your jukebox.

I'm not gonna be walking around here,
barefoot and pregnant,

making you sandwiches either.

No sandwiches, no singing.

What if the baby can't, d?

Can't what?

630

Can't hear.

631

You know it can be hereditary, right?

I promise.

[Little Duke] People are gonna
be all over this fight.

636
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:35,845
It got a lot of bad history, man.

637
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,006
Everything.

638
00:41:38,393 --> 00:41:39,473
Your dad.

639
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:40,804
And yours, too.

640
00:41:42,105 --> 00:41:43,470
Don't forget that he trained him.

641
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:47,607
I know why you didn't train me before.

642

I wasn't ready.

You was right.

Yeah, but this is different.

He's a monster, boy.

It's a balanced breakfast over there.

652

You think you ready for all that?

653

I gotta be.

655
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,226
at least do it for them.

656
00:42:33,114 --> 00:42:34,604
Think about it.

657
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,398
Beat what they couldn't beat.

658
00:42:38,286 --> 00:42:40,618
Change the way they were remembered.

659

[Tires screech]

660
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:45,824
This is our chance to rewrite history.

661
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:51,796
- Our history.
- [Viktor panting]

[In Russian]

663
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,057
[Little Duke] His record might be light,
but, believe me,

664
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:08,472
he ain't no undercard.

665
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:10,723
So, you gotta be with me.

666
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:13,564
I'm right here.

667
00:43:17,534 --> 00:43:18,534
We'll see.

668
00:43:24,624 --> 00:43:25,830
We'll see.

[Grunting]

671
00:43:57,699 --> 00:44:00,611
[Max] Creed versus drago.

672
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:02,609
That means something.

673
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:05,954
Did that factor into your decision
to take this fight?

674
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,281
I mean, you can't say creed
without drago, right?

675
00:44:08,418 --> 00:44:09,999
This is what y'all want.

676
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
It's what everyone wants.

677
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:14,875
[Max] Also, can't help but to nofice,

678
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:17,628
who won't be in your corner
this time around.

679
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:19,777
[Adonis] Rocky's taking
some family time.

680
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,131
But Duke's got me.

681
00:44:21,222 --> 00:44:23,338
His father taught my father
everything he knows.

682
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:25,411
[Little Duke] Speed, d.
That's how we gonna beat him.

683
00:44:25,435 --> 00:44:27,642
[Adonis] Technique, speed...

684
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:30,053
I'm confident he'll have me
ready for this fight.

685
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:35,021
[Max] And knowing what happened
between your father and drago,

686
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:37,355
you must have some worry.

687
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:39,312
What would I be afraid of?

688
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,759
I'm a fighter. This is what I do, right?

689
00:44:42,785 --> 00:44:43,991
[Little Duke] Who the champ?

690
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:45,485
It's who I am.

691
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,071
[Little Duke] Looking good!

692
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:17,649

[Cheering and applauding]

You're much smaller than your father.

You hear me?
He can't help behind that ring!

701

You stand there.
All you're doing is talking, homie.

702
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:54,387
Your pops can't protect you,
you feel me?

Don't talk about my father!
Don't turn your back on me!

You in my house, homie!

[Trainer] Make sure they hold them down.
We're in the dressing room.

[Jim] Jim lampley here,
along with Roy Jones.

We're moments away
from tonight's main event.

709
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:36,642
[Roy] Jim, I would have never thought
in a million years

710
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:39,520
I'd witness another
creed versus drago fight.

711
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:42,561
[Jim] Well, get ready, Roy.
Drago makes his way to the ring.

712
00:46:42,655 --> 00:46:45,271
His father leads the way
through the hostile crowd.

713
00:46:46,117 --> 00:46:48,233
[Roy] You can feel the energy.
I'm sure creed does.

714
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,818
He has a big advantage
with the fans in his corner.

at home, baby. Focus is the key.

718

[Jim] Given drago's size and style,

719
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,625
he'll look to use his power
to counter creed's speed.

[Little Duke] Remember why
we're here, man.

Like his father,
creed is ever the showman,

732

and is energizing the crowd.

exactly who this arena belongs to.

[Jim] It all feels so shakespearean.

Two sons, raised a world apart,
yet inexorably linked by tragedy.

737

Now, gentlemen,

738
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:52,524
I went over the rules
in the dressing room.

I wanna caution you to keep
this fight clean at all times.

[Jim] Creed fights without
longtime trainer rocky balboa.

00:49:11,596 --> 00:49:13,837
Interesting to see
how Duke manages the corner

747
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:15,762
with so much bad blood
between the fighters.

748

Look at him.

He think he gonna run
straight through you.

- You show him what's up.
- Yeah.

If all goes according to form,

creed is seen as
the more versatile boxer, quicker...

Yeah, baby, throw that jab! Let it rip!

758

[Jim] Drago is trying to land
something big.

759
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:48,750
[Rocky] Dig, dig.

with a couple of body shots.

And a right hand upstairs for creed.

Drago hasn't thrown
a meaningful punch yet.

765
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:04,929
And another right hand for creed.

[Crowd exclaims]

767
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:10,893
Creed blocked that punch

768
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:13,149
and still it knocked him back
into the ropes.

769
00:50:13,324 --> 00:50:14,359
Yeah, we good.

770
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,850
[Roy] Creed doesn't like that, Jim.

00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:18,652
Don't be stupid, kid. He's baiting you.

772
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:21,666
[Jim] Creed pressing now, angrily rushes
forward with a volley of punches.

773
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,618
He's pulling you in.

774
00:50:24,919 --> 00:50:26,910
[Jim] A huge left hook by drago!

775
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:28,857
- Come on, kid.
- [Jim] Creed shaken up by that punch.

776

[Rocky] Clear your head.

00:50:29,966 --> 00:50:31,360
[Jim] Creed commands
the center of the ring,

778
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:33,215
but there's a hard body shot
to the ribs.

779
00:50:33,386 --> 00:50:34,696
And another one on the other side.

What you doing, baby? What you doing, d?

781
00:50:37,598 --> 00:50:41,716
[Jim] And a right hand by drago
that knocks creed's head back.

782
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:43,927
[Roy] Creed can feel the power
behind those punches.

783
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:45,852
And now drago is on the attack.

784
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,542
Jab out, jab out, jab out.
Hands up, let's go!

[Jim] Drago's stalking him
along the ropes.

786
00:50:50,528 --> 00:50:51,938
Get off the ropes, d!

787
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:54,774
Out the corner!

No, d! Out the corner, out the corner!

[Bell dings]

790
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:07,163
[Jim] Hard right hand by drago,
and creed is shaken

791
00:51:07,336 --> 00:51:09,827
as the first round comes to a close.

792
00:51:10,006 --> 00:51:12,543
I think most watching at home
are a little surprised

793
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:14,999
by how impressive Viktor drago
has looked

794
00:51:15,094 --> 00:51:17,506
in these opening minutes of the fight.

795
00:51:19,098 --> 00:51:21,464
- [Sighs]
- With the history these men share,

796
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:23,424
Duke may have his hands full
keeping creed

797
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,680
from letting his emotions
get the best of him.

798
00:51:25,938 --> 00:51:27,223
What you doing, d?

799
00:51:27,315 --> 00:51:29,209
- You need to stick with the game plan.
- I know, I know.

800
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,833
Stay off the line. Take your angles.
You ain't taking your angles.

801
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:32,982
I know!

802
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,757
If he throws you a left hook...
Come on, man, hold the phone on that.

803
00:51:35,781 --> 00:51:37,676
- You think I don't know that shit?
- Well, if you know it,

804
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,815
do it!

805

[In Russian]

806
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:59,340
[Jim] And now, as we prepare for
round two, this crowd is still buzzing

807
00:51:59,513 --> 00:52:03,631
from the vicious rally that drago
brought forth in the last minute

808
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:05,515
of round number one.

809
00:52:05,686 --> 00:52:06,892
Come out smart.

810
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,874
[Jim] Got creed in serious trouble
as the round came to a close.

[Jim] And now, round two begins.

813
00:52:12,026 --> 00:52:15,769
And drago comes out throwing,
wasting no time.

814
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,450
[Crowd exclaims]

815
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:22,414
- Get off the ropes!
- [Jim] And creed is backed

816
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:28,788
Damn.

817
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:30,707
[Jim] Things just got ugly fast.

818
00:52:33,714 --> 00:52:37,673
And another hard right hand shot,
and creed is in big trouble now.

819
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,084
Keep moving, Donnie.

820
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,512
[Jim] A massive right hand
sends creed reeling.

821
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:49,597
He tries to regain his footing.

822
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,224
Creed trying to answer back.

823
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:55,358
And now a huge hook sends creed
flying through the ropes!

824
00:52:56,404 --> 00:52:57,564
Come on, kid.

825
00:53:03,786 --> 00:53:04,901
[Referee] Two!

826
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:06,114
Three!

827
00:53:06,205 --> 00:53:07,240
Four!

828
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:09,326
Five! Sixl

829
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,780
that's it, that's it, that's it.

830
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:11,937
[Crowd chanting] Creed! Creed!

831
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:13,747
You okay? Yeah.

832
00:53:16,465 --> 00:53:17,500
[Referee] Box!

833
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:18,652
[Jim] Creed needs something

834
00:53:18,676 --> 00:53:20,086
to try to turn this fight around.

835
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:21,177
[In Russian]

836
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:23,253
[Jim] Drago just keeps coming.

837
00:53:23,973 --> 00:53:25,804
- What a big rib shot!
- [Crowd exclaims]

838
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:27,347
[Little Duke] Shit.

839
00:53:27,435 --> 00:53:29,413
[Jim] Those were two tremendous
right hands to the rib cage.

840
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:31,974
You could've heard that one
in the nosebleed seats.

841
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:39,446
[Groaning]

842
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,522
Creed clearly in pain,
as he finds a way to his feet.

843
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,985
Not ready to give up yet.

844
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,367
[Roy] I don't know.
This is getting dangerous, Jim.

845
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:51,368
[Referee] Okay! Come to me!

846
00:53:51,834 --> 00:53:53,754
[Jim] And now,
bayless is gonna let him go again.

847
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:54,794
[Referee] Ready?

848
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:56,379
Box!

849
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:59,208
[Jim] He comes barreling
out of the corner.

850
00:53:59,383 --> 00:54:00,839
Huge right hook!

851
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,500
Drago trying to end it.

852
00:54:02,595 --> 00:54:03,595
[Bell dings]

853
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:05,920
And creed delivers a big right hand
at the bell.

854
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:07,534
[Referee] Get back!
Get back to your corner!

855
00:54:07,558 --> 00:54:09,844
[Jim] Bayless restraining drago,
seemingly frustrated...

856
00:54:09,977 --> 00:54:11,037
[Referee] Obey my commands.

857
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:13,143
[Jim] ...As he was close
to finishing the fight.

858
00:54:14,148 --> 00:54:16,890
[Referee] You got to show me something.
If not, I'm gonna stop it.

859
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:21,237
Can you fight?

860
00:54:21,322 --> 00:54:22,983
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

861
00:54:23,282 --> 00:54:25,523
Hell no. I'm calling this fight.

862
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:26,821
Nigga, don't call this shit.

863
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:28,783
You ain't got to prove shit to nobody.

864
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:30,987
Look at you.
Your ribs look like they broke.

865
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,578
[Panting] You can't call this fight.

866
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:38,505
[In Russian]

867
00:54:54,688 --> 00:54:56,804
[Groans] Hand me my mouthpiece.

868
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:58,480
[Panting]

869
00:54:59,985 --> 00:55:01,600
My mouthpiece.

870
00:55:11,872 --> 00:55:13,157
Don't do it.

871
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:16,203
[Jim] Now, as we go to round three,

872
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:18,955
Adonis creed has been beaten up
and bloodied

873
00:55:19,046 --> 00:55:21,378
by an avalanche of power shots

874
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:23,672
from Viktor drago
in the first two rounds.

875
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:26,549
And we'll see how much
Adonis creed has left now,

876
00:55:26,637 --> 00:55:28,073
as he tries to stay alive in the fight.

877
00:55:28,097 --> 00:55:29,633
Stop the fight.

878
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:31,468
[Roy] Dangerous swings from drago

879
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,175
as creed desperately tries
to hold him off.

880
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,556
[Jim] Drago's still putting
huge pressure on the body.

881
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,101
Come on, stop the fight!

882
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:43,560
[Jim] And another shot by drago!
Creed seemingly on his last legs!

883
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:45,269
- Drago on the attack.
- Come on, d!

884
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:47,939
[Crowd exclaims]

885
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:50,490
[Jim] Oh, and with a devastating shot
to the rib cage.

886
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:51,693
[Referee] Stop! Stop!

887
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:12,471
[Inaudible]

888
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:30,773
[Jim] This is an obvious
disqualification, or so it would appear

889
00:56:30,951 --> 00:56:32,816
because creed was fully down

890
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,947
at the moment
that drago landed that last shot.

891
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:36,600
- [Little Duke] No!
- [Trainer] You wanna kill somebody?

892
00:56:36,624 --> 00:56:38,824
- [Little Duke] No way, baby. No!
- [Padman] Easy, easy!

893
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:40,616
- No. No, no, no!
- [Bianca] Come on.

894
00:56:40,794 --> 00:56:42,580
[Little Duke] No! Just relax.

895
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:54,380
[Panting]

896
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:01,137
[Jim] This arena is completely silent

897
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:03,727
as the audience waits (to see

898
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:07,480
what will be the condition
of young Adonis creed.

899
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:25,828
[EKG beeping]

900
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:32,964
[Dr. ewell] Cracked orbital bone,
two cracked ribs, grade-3 concussion,

901
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:35,721
ruptured kidney, numerous contusions.

902
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,215
Oh...

903
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:39,553
A ruptured kidney, is that...

904
00:57:39,645 --> 00:57:41,385
His injuries will heal
with rest and time,

905
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,515
including the kidney.

906
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,001
Now, we shouldn't have
to resort to surgery,

907
00:57:45,025 --> 00:57:47,905
but we will need to keep him here
for at least 48 hours, as a precaution.

908
00:57:48,112 --> 00:57:51,730
Now he's still numb from the morphine,
but he'll certainly feel it later.

909
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:54,402
- Okay.
- You okay?

910
00:57:54,743 --> 00:57:56,984
Fine, I just gotta sit.

911
00:57:59,415 --> 00:58:00,905
If you're expecting...

912
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,083
No, I'm fine.

913
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:05,409
No, no, seriously. Take it easy, okay?

914
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:08,503
[Nurse] Excuse me, Dr. ewell.

915
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:12,132
You have a visitor. Right this way.

916
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:21,391
Bianca.

917
00:58:21,478 --> 00:58:23,343
Listen, I'm so sorry everything went...

918
00:58:23,522 --> 00:58:25,262
I should've been there.

919
00:58:26,066 --> 00:58:27,602
I'm so sorry.

920
00:58:28,944 --> 00:58:30,184
- I am.
- [Bianca sniffles]

921
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:31,477
[Bianca] Me, too.

922
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:33,312
Is it okay if I see him?

923
00:58:36,201 --> 00:58:38,513
[Little Duke] What difference do it make
to us? We saw what happened.

924
00:58:38,537 --> 00:58:40,177
They doing what they supposed
to be doing.

925
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:42,449
I don't care.

926
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,994
Right. Okay.

927
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:46,415
Got it.

928
00:58:55,929 --> 00:58:59,012
Wbc's not gonna contest
the referee's decision,

929
00:58:59,183 --> 00:59:02,926
so Viktor remains disqualified.

930
00:59:04,563 --> 00:59:05,563
Bottom line,

931
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:08,392
you still the champ.

932
00:59:08,484 --> 00:59:09,894
[Groans]

933
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,566
I'm gonna let you rest, man.

934
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:14,862
So, if you need something,
you know, I'm outside.

935
00:59:15,324 --> 00:59:17,064
[Breathing heavily]

936
00:59:23,123 --> 00:59:24,704
Got some company, d.

937
00:59:32,674 --> 00:59:33,834
[Grunts softly]

938
00:59:37,262 --> 00:59:38,718
[Exhales heavily]

939
00:59:42,976 --> 00:59:44,762
You did good.

940
00:59:44,937 --> 00:59:46,347
We tried.

941
00:59:57,533 --> 01:00:00,366
You know,
I watched you back in Philadelphia.

942
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:04,699
You showed a ton of heart.
I mean, there's no doubt about it.

943
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:06,784
- Showed a ton of heart.
- Heart? [Grunts]

944
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:11,065
Man, I ain't trying to hear that shit.

945
01:00:11,213 --> 01:00:13,329
D it's rock.

946
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:16,749
- Oh, it's okay. It's all right.
- No, you guys gotta work it out.

947
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:20,256
I lost the fight
before it even started, right?

948
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:24,056
No. No, no.

949
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:27,308
This guy was...
He's a big guy, he's strong.

950
01:00:27,396 --> 01:00:29,207
He got the reach on you.
He got all kinds of...

951
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:30,846
Oh, now you're trying to train me?

952
01:00:34,111 --> 01:00:35,396
Be my coach?

953
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,821
[Breathing raggedly]
No, look at me.

954
01:00:42,035 --> 01:00:43,445
I ook at me.

955
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:50,203
What are you still doing here?

956
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:54,453
Here to pick up the pieces?

957
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:55,962
[Rocky] No.

958
01:00:56,508 --> 01:00:57,668
[Whimpers]

959
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,875
Shouldn't you be in Philly?

960
01:01:00,512 --> 01:01:02,127
- [Bianca] Adonis.
- No, it's okay.

961
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,847
I don't want him to get all... [mumbles]

962
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:09,931
Take care of each other.

963
01:01:12,357 --> 01:01:13,597
I'm sorry.

964
01:01:14,776 --> 01:01:17,108
[Breathing raggedly, grunts]

965
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:23,694
[Sniffles]

966
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,410
[Shudders]

967
01:01:28,081 --> 01:01:29,446
[Softly] Baby.

968
01:01:33,253 --> 01:01:35,118
He loves you, d.

969
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:39,960
I ook at me.

970
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:42,175
[Moans]

971
01:01:42,262 --> 01:01:44,002
[Bianca] I'm looking right at you, babe.

972
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,257
[Sobs softly]

[Man 1] Adonis, do you really
feel like a champ?

978
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:46,360
Do you think you deserve
to keep the belt?

979
01:02:46,535 --> 01:02:48,012
[Man 2] Why would you take
that fight, Adonis?

980
01:02:48,036 --> 01:02:49,742
[Man 3] Is this it for Adonis creed?

[Adonis] I'm cool. I'm cool. [Grunts]

983
01:03:03,885 --> 01:03:06,592
- D, please, let me help you, baby.
- I said I can walk.

984
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,965
- Please sit...
- I said I got it.

[Bianca] I don't know.
Lately, it's like...

989
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:08,147
He hasn't really been himself.

990
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,066
And I get it.

991
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:13,910
'Cause he's going through a lot.

992
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,656
He's just starting physical therapy.

993
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:20,413
Trying to get himself right.

994
01:04:21,296 --> 01:04:22,502
And

995
01:04:23,882 --> 01:04:25,213
he's, uh...

996
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:27,291
Distant

997
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,462
and disconnected.

998
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,632
It's like nothing really matters
to him right now.

999
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:40,391
Which is new.

1000
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:44,648
Yeah.

1001
01:04:46,113 --> 01:04:50,072
[Mary Anne] Listen, be there for him,
take care of him,

1002
01:04:51,201 --> 01:04:53,032
give him your love.

1003
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,407
But also, you gotta realize
he's in a place right now

1004
01:04:56,498 --> 01:04:58,363
that only he can get himself out of.

1005

And with everything he's going through...

1006

[Mary Anne] With everything
he's going through?

1007
01:05:01,586 --> 01:05:03,952
You've been in his corner
every step of the way.

1008
01:05:07,008 --> 01:05:08,418
He's a grown man.

1009
01:05:12,097 --> 01:05:14,588
He's gotta heal from the inside out.

1010
01:05:14,808 --> 01:05:17,641
Trust me, I know. I've been there.

1011

Viktor, here we are just months since
your controversial loss to Adonis creed.

1019
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,371
How does this win feel?

1020
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:23,664
What loss?

1021
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:25,500
[Max] Excuse me.

1022
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:28,124
From your disqualification
to Adonis creed.

1023
01:06:28,256 --> 01:06:30,372
But how does this feel to you tonight?

1024
01:06:30,926 --> 01:06:33,713
I don't care. Creed must fight me.

1025
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:37,050
- [Max] And if he doesn't fight you?
- [Viktor] Then he's no champion.

1026
01:06:37,182 --> 01:06:40,925
[Max] There you have if, Adonis.

to hit you up, though.

Commissioner wanna know
who we plan to fight next.

You ain't gotta fight drago,

1050
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:08,090
but you gotta fight someone.

1051
01:10:08,685 --> 01:10:10,346
You gotta defend the belt.

1052
01:10:11,396 --> 01:10:13,387
Otherwise, it's gonna be vacated.

1053
01:10:15,984 --> 01:10:19,147
I could set up a little,
you know, tune-up fight, kind of.

No. You know what, man?

Hey, ma.

How you doing, kid?

What are you doing here?

I hope you don't mind,

1081
01:12:40,378 --> 01:12:43,996
your mom asked if I would come out
'cause she's worried about you.

1082
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,504
I am, too.

1083
01:12:49,137 --> 01:12:50,502
I'm good.

1084
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:54,579
You didn't have to come all this way.

1085
01:12:54,726 --> 01:12:55,886
By train.

1086

[Chuckles] Three days on a train.

1087
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,726
It's all right, you know,
gives you time to think.

1088
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:07,234
And you watch all these places
whipping by the windows like postcards.

1089
01:13:07,405 --> 01:13:09,191
It's quite an experience.

1090
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,526
Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

1091
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:13,282
Yeah, it was nice.

1092
01:13:14,621 --> 01:13:16,077
This 1s wonderful.

1093
01:13:16,247 --> 01:13:19,455
How you have all this out here.

1094
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:22,374
You could have the same.

1095
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:25,036
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

1096
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,796
I mean, not just the shiny stuff,

1097
01:13:28,593 --> 01:13:30,049
but the better stuff.

1098
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:33,506
Have a better life.

1099
01:13:37,268 --> 01:13:38,974
Be a better man.

1100
01:13:41,356 --> 01:13:44,564
You know, I was thinking about
what you were saying about

1101
01:13:44,692 --> 01:13:48,276
what smart decisions have I made lately.

1102
01:13:51,866 --> 01:13:53,822
Couldn't think of many.

1103
01:13:55,787 --> 01:13:59,655
You know, I wasn't even there
when my son's son,

1104
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:02,994
my grandson,

1105
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:04,959
was born.

1106
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:10,248
I mean, he's like
that tall now probably.

1107
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:13,088
I don't even know him.
He doesn't know me.

1108
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:18,097
It's pathetic.

1109
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:21,141
Well, why won't you just

1110
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:23,890
call him?

1111
01:14:24,982 --> 01:14:27,189
It ain't that easy, you know...

1112
01:14:29,696 --> 01:14:30,696
Listen,

1113
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:34,363
I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

1114
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:36,907
You know what I mean?

1115
01:14:39,789 --> 01:14:41,700
So, you gotta ask yourself,

1116
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,832
what's the valuable stuff?

1117
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,627
It's like I asked you before.

1118
01:14:48,464 --> 01:14:51,046
What were you really fighting for?

1119
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:54,667
I was afraid.

1120
01:14:58,099 --> 01:14:59,430
Of this.

1121
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,385
Expectations.

1122
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,896
Being the champ.

1123
01:15:09,402 --> 01:15:12,394
I was scared I couldn't do
what he couldn't.

1124
01:15:14,866 --> 01:15:16,197
It's weird.

1125
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:20,826
I used to feel like he was a part of me.

1126
01:15:22,415 --> 01:15:24,622
Now I can't hear him, or that thing,

1127
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:27,541
that thing that tells me
to get in the ring.

1128
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:30,620
Move my feet, keep my hands up.

1129
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:32,959
Hit anything that gets in my way.

1130
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,216
I can't hear it anymore.

1131
01:15:47,231 --> 01:15:49,313
I don't even know how I lost.

1132
01:15:49,484 --> 01:15:51,440
Your mind wasn't right.

1133
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:57,859
And your natural style just won't work
with a guy that big.

1134
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,206
You saying yours was better?

1135
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:10,873
I won, didn't I?

1136
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:13,667
[Both chuckle]

1137
01:16:17,929 --> 01:16:20,545
- Good seeing you, unc.
- Great to see you, too.

1138
01:16:21,224 --> 01:16:22,714
I was talking with your mother,

1139
01:16:22,809 --> 01:16:28,179
and she says you came up
with this name for the child.

1140
01:16:28,356 --> 01:16:29,562
Amara. Amara.

1141
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,725
Yeah. Yeah.

1142
01:16:30,983 --> 01:16:32,044
Why, what's wrong with that?

1143
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:35,105
No, it's a beautiful name,
but it's kind of complicated.

1144
01:16:35,196 --> 01:16:36,732
Why don't you think about something,

1145
01:16:36,823 --> 01:16:38,984
at least I would,
a little simpler to say,

1146
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:42,317
like "Becky" or "Cate,"
something like that.

1147
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,526
Cate creed?

1148
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:45,612
Cate creed. Two "c's." Easy to remember.

1149
01:16:45,706 --> 01:16:47,412
You do know she's gonna be black, right?

1150
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,619
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1151
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,021
- [Laughing]
- [Cell phone vibrating]

1152
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:52,285
Okay.

1153
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:55,045
Hey, ma. Yeah.

1154
01:16:56,926 --> 01:16:58,336
Walt, right now?

1155
01:17:00,263 --> 01:17:01,628
- [Rocky] Relax.
- [Adonis] Okay.

1156
01:17:01,722 --> 01:17:03,962
- [Rocky] Everything's gonna be fine.
- [Adonis] Mmm-hmm.

1157
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,307
[Rocky] You just gotta be there for her,
okay? That's your job.

1158
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:08,539
[Adonis] I got you, I got you.

1159
01:17:08,563 --> 01:17:10,019
- And remember...
- Yeah.

1160
01:17:10,106 --> 01:17:12,973
Today is gonna be the best day
of your life. Right here.

1161
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:15,604
All right? Yeah.

1162
01:17:17,613 --> 01:17:19,103
Best day of your life.

1163
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:22,747
- [Whispers] I'm having a baby.
- [Rocky] I feel like I'm having a baby.

1164
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:27,278
- [Mary Anne] Boy!
- Hey.

1165
01:17:27,456 --> 01:17:28,934
- [Mary Anne] What you doing?
- I know...

1166
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:31,119
No, never mind. Just get in here.

1167
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,416
Okay. Okay, okay.

1168
01:17:32,503 --> 01:17:34,789
Like I said,
I'll be here if you need me.

1169
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:38,331
- All right.
- All right.

1170
01:17:42,221 --> 01:17:44,132
You know, I'm gonna do what I can.

1171
01:17:45,391 --> 01:17:48,383
You being here is more than enough.

1172
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:49,846
Thank you.

1173
01:18:02,825 --> 01:18:04,235
[Sighs]

1174
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:09,039
[Clears throat]

1175
01:18:22,929 --> 01:18:24,044
[Grunts softly]

1176
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:41,818
Mr. balboa?

1177
01:18:41,906 --> 01:18:44,067
- Mmm.
- She's here.

1178
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:46,365
Oh, that's great.

1179
01:18:49,205 --> 01:18:52,288
That's absolutely good.

1180
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,456
That's fantastic.

1181
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:02,672
[Chuckles] Yo!

1182
01:19:03,386 --> 01:19:06,173
Hey, unc, say hi to your goddaughter.

1183
01:19:06,305 --> 01:19:08,546
Wow. That's quite an honor.

1184
01:19:10,351 --> 01:19:11,951
- Let me see you.
- [Bianca] Here she is.

1185
01:19:12,687 --> 01:19:15,679
[Rocky] Hey, hello, beautiful.

1186
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:17,979
So, nurse...

1187
01:19:18,234 --> 01:19:19,234
Hmm?

1188
01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:23,314
What about the test?

1189
01:19:24,824 --> 01:19:26,610
[Nurse] Relax for now.

1190
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:30,489
We'll run an auditory exam
as soon as you and Amara get some rest.

1191
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,621
It's okay, babe.

1192
01:19:35,793 --> 01:19:38,000
- Thank god she looks like you.
- [Bianca laughs]

1193
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,501
[Bianca] Yeah, right.

1194
01:19:44,844 --> 01:19:46,960
[Adonis] So, is she gonna feel anything?

1195
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:49,716
No, it's painless. I promise.

1196
01:19:50,683 --> 01:19:52,548
Okay. Now that they're in place,

1197
01:19:52,643 --> 01:19:55,259
what we're gonna do
is give her a series of click stimuli

1198
01:19:55,438 --> 01:19:56,894
around 35 decibels

1199
01:19:56,981 --> 01:19:59,063
and check her neural responses.

1200
01:19:59,191 --> 01:20:00,397
Is that loud?

1201
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:02,482
Normal auditory range.

1202
01:20:04,697 --> 01:20:05,777
Okay.

1203
01:20:06,532 --> 01:20:07,647
Here we go.

1204
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:12,026
So what exactly are we looking for?

1205
01:20:12,204 --> 01:20:13,944
A reading. Spikes.

1206
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:15,571
[Machine beeping intermittently]

1207
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:48,521
So, we're not seeing
any waves or spikes, uh,

1208
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:52,529
and given your family history,
there is some cause for concern.

1209
01:20:52,703 --> 01:20:54,819
However, it is very early...
[Voice fading]

1210
01:21:21,857 --> 01:21:23,537
[Adonis] They're gonna run
some more tests.

1211
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:28,110
They said it's early, and,
uh, sometimes they get false reads.

1212
01:21:32,743 --> 01:21:34,574
Let me ask you something.

1213
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:38,828
What if it ain't okay?

1214
01:21:40,251 --> 01:21:41,457
I can't think like that.

1215
01:21:43,295 --> 01:21:45,001
You gotta, I mean,

1216
01:21:46,549 --> 01:21:48,210
how you gonna handle it?

1217
01:21:49,176 --> 01:21:50,256
Hmm?

1218
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:56,221
I don't wanna go there.

1219
01:21:57,101 --> 01:21:58,341
You gonna love her?

1220
01:21:59,478 --> 01:22:01,935
How you gonna ask me
a question like that, rock?

1221
01:22:02,106 --> 01:22:04,188
- Yeah, I'm gonna love her.
- Good.

1222
01:22:04,358 --> 01:22:07,145
'Cause she ain't feeling sorry
for herself,

1223
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:09,605
and you shouldn't either.

1224
01:22:19,373 --> 01:22:21,830
[Bianca chuckles] You got a little...

1225
01:22:23,961 --> 01:22:25,826
Oh, it's boxing gloves.

1226
01:22:27,298 --> 01:22:28,629
- You got it?
- [Adonis] Yeah.

1227
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,137
[Bianca gasps] Goodnight moon.
I love that book.

1228
01:22:40,644 --> 01:22:42,350
Who's that from, babe?

1229
01:22:44,815 --> 01:22:47,477
[Van pelt] The unanimous
number one contender Viktor drago

1230
01:22:47,568 --> 01:22:49,775
has been met with open arms
back in Russia,

1231
01:22:49,862 --> 01:22:51,853
his father's home, which is nice.

1232
01:22:51,947 --> 01:22:55,314
But the question on everyone's mind is,
"where is creed?"

1233
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:59,201
If he doesn't choose an opponent soon,
he risks forfeiting the title

1234
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:02,576
and personally, I can't imagine him
being able to live with that.

1235
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:06,458
You good?

1236
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:10,003
Yeah. Finally got her to settle.

1237
01:23:11,634 --> 01:23:13,875
Hey, I need to get out of the house.

1238
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:16,760
I was gonna go over to the studio.

1239
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:19,339
You mind watching her until I get back?

1240
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:22,053
Yeah, of course.

1241
01:23:22,645 --> 01:23:23,885
Cool.

1242
01:23:24,063 --> 01:23:27,226
- Okay, okay.
- [Amara coos]

1243
01:23:27,942 --> 01:23:28,942
Yeanh.

1244
01:23:37,993 --> 01:23:39,028
You okay?

1245
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,486
Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

1246
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:43,954
Okay.

1247
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:46,327
Bye.

1248
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:51,249
[Amara cooing]

- [Door closes]

1250

[Adonis softly] Hey.

1251
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:05,433
Baby.

1252
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:07,848
Baby, please.

1253
01:24:08,023 --> 01:24:10,605
Hey, you hungry, right?
Hey, baby, you hungry?

[Mary Anne] It's Mary Anne.
Please leave a message.

1257
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:23,990
Hey, ma. Listen, listen.

1258
01:24:24,164 --> 01:24:26,746
She won't stop crying.
Can you just tell me how to...

1259
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:28,770
Can you tell me how to
make her stop crying?

1260
01:24:28,794 --> 01:24:30,910
Call me back
when you get this message, okay?

1261

[Switch clicks]

- Hey, what's up, baby girl?
- [Fussing]

1264
01:25:06,457 --> 01:25:07,697
[Softly] Hey, no.

1265
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,911
It's okay, baby. No, no.

1266
01:25:10,002 --> 01:25:12,288
No, don't cry. No, not again, please.

1267
01:25:12,963 --> 01:25:14,043
Please.

1268
01:25:14,131 --> 01:25:15,871
No, look, look, look.

1269
01:25:17,384 --> 01:25:18,624
You see that?

1270
01:25:19,053 --> 01:25:20,168
Look, look, look.

1271
01:25:21,555 --> 01:25:22,590
Look.

1272

I know.

Hi

How'd you do?

1290
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:20,291
She's a fighter.

1291
01:27:23,844 --> 01:27:25,550
Just like her dad.

1292

Just like her mom, too.

1293

I don't wanna be that person
to stop you.

It can't be, 'cause we a team.

We weren't a team
when you took the fight the last time.

You right.

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have put you through that.

You wouldn't be any good to anybody
if you didn't do what you love.

You wouldn't be able to breathe, right?

Well, I wouldn't be any good to anybody
if I don't handle this the right way.

It's a clear advantage
if it comes down to a judge's decision.

1330
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,908
Well, then we can't let it
get to a judge's decision, right?

[Max] The unique thing
about this fight, Jim,

1388
01:37:33,661 --> 01:37:39,201
is Adonis creed comes in
a 25-to-1 underdog,

and he's the champ!

let's get ready to rumble!

1454
01:42:32,627 --> 01:42:34,743
[Crowd cheering]

1455
01:42:36,172 --> 01:42:39,790
[Max] You can feel the nervous energy
in the arena tonight, Jim.

1456
01:42:39,884 --> 01:42:42,466
Creed has some courage
to get back into the ring

1457
01:42:42,553 --> 01:42:44,589
with a man who nearly ended his career.

1458
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,797
A man who is hungry to be champ.

1459
01:42:53,981 --> 01:42:55,016
[Referee] Fighters,

1460
01:42:55,108 --> 01:42:56,348
[speaks Russian]

1461
01:42:56,442 --> 01:42:58,307
[In english] I want good, clean fight.

1462
01:42:58,403 --> 01:43:00,644
[Referee speaks Russian]

1463
01:43:00,738 --> 01:43:02,729
[In english]
Break when I tell you to break.

1464
01:43:03,074 --> 01:43:05,656
You go to your corner
when I tell you to go to your corner.

1465
01:43:05,952 --> 01:43:07,738
[Referee speaking Russian]

1466
01:43:12,166 --> 01:43:13,206
[In english] Touch gloves.

1467
01:43:13,501 --> 01:43:16,914
[Max] Rocky balboa and Ivan drago
sharing the ring

1468
01:43:17,004 --> 01:43:18,915
for the first time in 30 years.

1469
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:23,629
[Jim] If anyone knows how to take on
a slugger like drago, it would be rocky.

1470
01:43:24,178 --> 01:43:26,169
[Rocky] You know you got
the fire in your gut,

1471
01:43:26,681 --> 01:43:29,673
and I know you'll do
what needs to be done.

1472
01:43:30,184 --> 01:43:34,302
Because now,
you know what you're fighting for.

1473
01:43:35,481 --> 01:43:36,481
[In Russian]

1474
01:43:38,776 --> 01:43:42,234
[Max] Viktor overwhelmed
creed's previous game plan,

1475
01:43:42,321 --> 01:43:43,721
and I think it got in Adonis' head.

1476
01:43:45,324 --> 01:43:48,282
[Max] It's gonna be interesting to see
how rocky balboa has prepared creed

1477
01:43:48,369 --> 01:43:51,361
for what is surely to become
an all-out brawl.

1478
01:43:51,456 --> 01:43:52,696
[Referee] Ready?

1479
01:43:53,332 --> 01:43:54,697
Ready?

1480
01:43:55,334 --> 01:43:56,574
- [Dings]
- Box.

1481
01:43:56,669 --> 01:43:57,704
[Jim] And we're underway.

1482
01:43:58,254 --> 01:44:02,042
[Max] Drago comes out swinging
with two hooks that creed avoids.

1483
01:44:02,508 --> 01:44:04,590
[Jim] And a big right-hand
right out of the gate.

1484
01:44:04,677 --> 01:44:06,008
Watch that right, Donnie.

1485
01:44:06,304 --> 01:44:09,671
[Jim] Drago a bit surprised
as creed shakes that punch off.

1486
01:44:10,975 --> 01:44:11,975
[In Russian]

1487
01:44:15,313 --> 01:44:18,430
[Max] Drago is pressing hard,
but creed is not backing off.

1488
01:44:19,901 --> 01:44:21,186
Keep moving, keep moving.

1489
01:44:21,277 --> 01:44:23,893
[Jim] Creed working a little bit closer
to drago tonight.

1490
01:44:25,990 --> 01:44:27,150
[Crowd exclaims]

1491
01:44:27,241 --> 01:44:30,108
[Max] That is a vicious combination
by creed.

1492
01:44:33,956 --> 01:44:36,288
- [Jim] And now a right hand by drago.
- [Crowd cheering]

1493
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:39,242
[Max] Here we go,
drago applying pressure.

1494
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,820
- Out the corner!
- Come on, Donnie!

1495
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:45,172
[Max] Creed manages to slip away.

1496
01:44:46,677 --> 01:44:47,677
Let's get it.

1497
01:44:49,722 --> 01:44:51,462
- [Crowd exclaims]
- Yeah, what's up?

1498
01:44:51,557 --> 01:44:54,344
[Max] Now they're squaring off
in the middle of the ring, toe-to-toe.

1499
01:44:54,519 --> 01:44:55,725
Taking blows.

1500
01:44:55,811 --> 01:44:57,372
- Creed staying in his face.
- [Bell dings]

1501
01:44:57,396 --> 01:44:59,762
And there's the bell!
As a wild first round comes to an end.

1502
01:44:59,857 --> 01:45:00,977
[Referee] Go to your corner.

1503
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:03,837
[Jim] Drago frustrated. Creed is looking
like a different fighter tonight, Max.

1504
01:45:03,861 --> 01:45:05,817
- That's it, d! That's it!
- [Mary Anne] Yes!

1505
01:45:06,155 --> 01:45:08,237
Oh, yeah, who's saying drago
now, though?

1506
01:45:08,324 --> 01:45:09,985
[Exclaiming]

1507
01:45:10,576 --> 01:45:12,346
[Rocky] See, all that work in the desert
paid off, right?

1508
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:13,970
Yeah, you got him. You got him thinking.

1509
01:45:13,996 --> 01:45:15,474
He wasn't expecting
what you're bringing.

1510
01:45:15,498 --> 01:45:18,298
Now, he's gonna bring the heat
the next round, but you're ready for it.

1511
01:45:19,377 --> 01:45:20,377
[In Russian]

1512
01:45:23,089 --> 01:45:24,875
He overextends his right hand.

1513
01:45:24,966 --> 01:45:26,246
You gonna counter with the right

1514
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,940
and crack him with the left.
You got that?

1515
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:29,488
Extend the right,
crack him with the left.

1516
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:32,800
He'll never expect it.
His old man did the same thing to me.

1517
01:45:33,099 --> 01:45:34,760
[Jim] One early observation, Max.

1518
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:37,637
I think creed is withstanding
drago's combinations

1519
01:45:37,728 --> 01:45:39,764
much better tonight
than in the first fight.

1520
01:45:39,855 --> 01:45:40,855
- Box.
- [Bell dings]

1521
01:45:41,107 --> 01:45:42,768
[Jim] And round two begins.

1522
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:46,270
- [Max] Drago with a huge left hook.
- [Crowd exclaims]

1523
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:49,987
[Jim] And a big right hand.

1524
01:45:50,074 --> 01:45:53,316
Drago on the attack again,
now driving creed back into the ropes.

1525
01:45:53,494 --> 01:45:55,780
He's overextending the right!
Watch the right!

1526
01:45:58,291 --> 01:45:59,906
[Jim] A right and a left for creed.

1527
01:46:02,295 --> 01:46:03,295
[In Russian]

1528
01:46:07,508 --> 01:46:08,793
[Crowd cheering]

1529
01:46:12,305 --> 01:46:15,012
[Jim] Huge uppercut
has creed holding on now.

1530
01:46:15,099 --> 01:46:17,215
Drago throws him off into the corner.

1531
01:46:21,522 --> 01:46:23,482
- Get out of that corner!
- Get out of the corner!

1532
01:46:25,568 --> 01:46:28,184
[Jim] And drago throws creed
to the canvas.

1533
01:46:28,779 --> 01:46:29,779
[Speaking Russian]

1534
01:46:31,741 --> 01:46:32,776
What's going on?

1535
01:46:32,992 --> 01:46:36,655
[Max] Shades of the first fight,
but drago showing restraint this time.

1536
01:46:36,746 --> 01:46:37,746
[Referee] You good?

1537
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:39,030
- Yes, I'm good.
- [In Russian]

1538
01:46:41,417 --> 01:46:43,829
- [Referee] Box.
- [Max] Drago explodes from the break.

1539
01:46:44,545 --> 01:46:45,785
And creed is down!

1540
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,711
A flurry of heavy shots!

1541
01:46:48,007 --> 01:46:51,090
Drago's power is just incredible.

1542
01:46:52,553 --> 01:46:53,759
[Referee] Three.

1543
01:46:54,305 --> 01:46:55,340
Four.

1544
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,006
[Rocky] Take the eight count.
Take the full eight.

1545
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:59,494
[Max] Creed taking his time
on the canvas.

1546
01:46:59,518 --> 01:47:00,518
[Referee] Six.

1547
01:47:00,728 --> 01:47:02,093
Stay down! Breathe!

1548
01:47:02,188 --> 01:47:04,930
[Max] He's listening to rocky,
who has been in this situation before.

1549
01:47:05,024 --> 01:47:06,059
[Referee] Eight.

1550
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:08,170
[Jim] And creed is back on his feet.
Beats the count.

1551
01:47:08,194 --> 01:47:09,296
- [Referee] Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

1552
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:10,355
Box.

1553
01:47:10,446 --> 01:47:12,357
Tie him up. Don't fight him. Tie him up.

1554
01:47:12,448 --> 01:47:14,655
- [Max] Drago is right back at it.
- [Bell dings]

1555
01:47:15,951 --> 01:47:17,407
[Crowd cheering]

1556
01:47:17,495 --> 01:47:20,202
[Jim] So, with the knockdown
and those hard shots at the end,

1557
01:47:20,289 --> 01:47:23,122
that round clearly goes to Viktor drago.

1558
01:47:23,209 --> 01:47:25,666
And you could just feel
he's gaining momentum.

1559
01:47:25,753 --> 01:47:27,353
You knew this was gonna be a war, right?

1560
01:47:27,421 --> 01:47:28,786
You knew that going in there.

1561
01:47:28,881 --> 01:47:31,042
From now on, it's who wants it more,

1562
01:47:31,133 --> 01:47:32,623
and who's got more heart.

1563
01:47:32,718 --> 01:47:33,718
[In Russian]

1564
01:47:35,971 --> 01:47:38,492
Don't let him crack you. You stay
on the outside, you're gonna get hurt.

1565
01:47:38,516 --> 01:47:40,507
You stay on the inside,
you'll tear him up.

1566
01:47:40,601 --> 01:47:41,953
I'm telling you,
it's all about pressure.

1567
01:47:41,977 --> 01:47:45,219
If you wanna give pain,
you gotta be willing to take the pain.

1568
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:54,736
[Crowd shouting]

1569
01:47:55,366 --> 01:47:56,697
Come on!

1570
01:48:01,247 --> 01:48:02,327
- Yes!
- [Little Duke] Yes!

1571
01:48:03,499 --> 01:48:04,499
[In Russian]

1572
01:48:07,086 --> 01:48:09,668
[Jim] Round four
is another brutal display

1573
01:48:09,755 --> 01:48:12,497
as creed takes a lot of punishment
from drago.

1574
01:48:12,883 --> 01:48:14,248
[Crowd cheering]

1575
01:48:14,635 --> 01:48:16,717
- [Max] Drago is not slowing down.
- [Bell dings]

1576
01:48:16,804 --> 01:48:19,261
Landing a big shot after the bell.

1577
01:48:20,725 --> 01:48:21,840
What is your problem?

1578
01:48:21,934 --> 01:48:23,049
Yol

1579
01:48:25,062 --> 01:48:27,849
[Max] The violent chess match
continues, Jim.

1580
01:48:28,816 --> 01:48:30,727
Oh, and creed is down again.

1581
01:48:31,402 --> 01:48:32,482
Donnie, get up.

1582
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:36,813
[Max] Drago clearly dominating
this fight, but creed will not give up.

1583
01:48:36,907 --> 01:48:38,522
He is taking a lot of punishment.

1584
01:48:38,617 --> 01:48:40,095
[Rocky] You gotta stay in his face.
Look at me.

1585
01:48:40,119 --> 01:48:42,110
You gotta stay in his face.

1586
01:48:42,204 --> 01:48:44,866
And when you see an opportunity,
you go after it.

1587
01:48:44,957 --> 01:48:46,572
[Both grunting]

1588
01:48:49,211 --> 01:48:50,326
There you are!

1589
01:48:53,799 --> 01:48:55,039
Drago is cut now.

1590
01:48:59,638 --> 01:49:01,174
[Max] As we enter round eight,

1591
01:49:01,265 --> 01:49:04,473
we are deeper into this fight
than anyone expected.

1592
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,677
[Jim] Creed must sense he's behind.
He's trying to force the action.

1593
01:49:10,608 --> 01:49:11,723
Yes, baby!

1594
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:18,775
[Bell dings]

1595
01:49:20,534 --> 01:49:23,571
[Max] What we are seeing tonight
is Adonis creed

1596
01:49:23,662 --> 01:49:26,825
standing up to the awesome power
of Viktor drago.

1597
01:49:26,916 --> 01:49:28,577
He's not going anywhere.

1598
01:49:32,338 --> 01:49:33,338
[In Russian]

1599
01:49:36,383 --> 01:49:38,123
[Breathing heavily]

1600
01:49:38,219 --> 01:49:40,005
[Jim] Viktor drago looks tired, Max.

1601
01:49:40,095 --> 01:49:43,713
Keep in mind, he's never had to go past
the 4th round in a professional fight.

1602
01:49:45,559 --> 01:49:46,719
[Adonis grunts]

1603
01:49:47,269 --> 01:49:49,430
- Hey! What was that?
- Take the point, ref!

1604
01:49:49,522 --> 01:49:50,978
[Jim] And drago drops creed

1605
01:49:51,065 --> 01:49:52,585
- with two nasty body shots.
- Come on!

1606
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:54,641
- He held him and hit him.
- [Referee] One.

1607
01:49:55,152 --> 01:49:58,110
[Max] Viktor holding and maybe
getting away with something there.

1608
01:49:58,197 --> 01:49:59,937
The ref must not have seen it.

1609
01:50:00,032 --> 01:50:01,147
- [Sighs]
- [Dings]

1610
01:50:01,158 --> 01:50:01,943
- [Sighs]
- [Dings]

1611
01:50:02,034 --> 01:50:03,069
Come on.

1612
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,947
[Max] I think rocky balboa
has a decision to make here, Jim.

1613
01:50:06,038 --> 01:50:07,653
He knows better than anyone

1614
01:50:07,748 --> 01:50:11,332
how this same story played out
three decades ago.

1615
01:50:11,418 --> 01:50:12,854
- [Pained grunting]
- [Rocky] Donnie, Donnie, talk to me.

1616
01:50:12,878 --> 01:50:13,878
Donnie.

1617
01:50:14,255 --> 01:50:15,495
Your ribs?

1618
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:16,989
- You think it's broke?
- [Groaning]

1619
01:50:20,678 --> 01:50:22,043
[Panting]

1620
01:50:23,222 --> 01:50:24,222
[In Russian]

1621
01:50:27,226 --> 01:50:28,537
[Rocky] What do you wanna do, Donnie?

1622
01:50:28,561 --> 01:50:30,142
[Moaning]

1623
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:31,435
You wanna call it?

1624
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:33,474
[Grunts]

1625
01:50:36,443 --> 01:50:37,649
I didn't think so.

1626
01:50:38,821 --> 01:50:39,821
[In Russian]

1627
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:44,427
[Rocky] Now he's gonna come after you,

1628
01:50:44,451 --> 01:50:46,411
and he's gonna try to break
on that rib some more.

1629
01:50:46,954 --> 01:50:48,069
But that's okay.

1630
01:50:48,414 --> 01:50:50,054
'Cause you like the pain.
You can take it.

1631
01:50:50,082 --> 01:50:52,323
You know why? Because you're dangerous.

1632
01:50:53,294 --> 01:50:54,955
- I'm dangerous.
- [Rocky] That's right.

1633
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:56,786
[Referee] Ten seconds out.

1634
01:51:04,263 --> 01:51:05,719
[Panting]

1635
01:51:06,098 --> 01:51:07,098
[Exhales]

1636
01:51:14,148 --> 01:51:16,230
[Jim] Now here we go with round ten

1637
01:51:16,317 --> 01:51:18,524
- of what has become a war of attrition.
- [Bell dings]

1638
01:51:18,777 --> 01:51:22,986
Drago seemingly ahead on the scorecards,
but creed refusing to back down.

1639
01:51:23,073 --> 01:51:24,529
That's it, Donnie. Good.

1640
01:51:25,075 --> 01:51:27,612
[Max] Creed using whatever he has
left in the tank.

1641
01:51:27,995 --> 01:51:29,701
[Jim] Drago working the body.

1642
01:51:29,788 --> 01:51:30,903
Tie him up!

1643
01:51:36,295 --> 01:51:38,035
[Jim] And down goes creed again.

1644
01:51:38,255 --> 01:51:40,712
- And this could be the end of the fight.
- [Pained grunting]

1645
01:51:44,345 --> 01:51:45,926
[Yells]

1646
01:51:54,647 --> 01:51:56,262
[Inaudible]

1647
01:52:04,615 --> 01:52:06,196
[Muffled cheering]

1648
01:52:10,537 --> 01:52:11,822
Get up, d.

1649
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:19,042
[Grunting]

1650
01:52:21,298 --> 01:52:22,538
[Groans]

1651
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:27,259
[Max] No man should be able to
fight through that beating,

1652
01:52:27,346 --> 01:52:29,146
but Adonis creed
wills himself off the canvas.

1653
01:52:29,181 --> 01:52:30,661
- [Referee] What's your name?
- Creed.

1654
01:52:30,933 --> 01:52:32,173
What's your name?

1655
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,928
Creed!

1656
01:52:37,564 --> 01:52:38,564
Box!

1657
01:52:38,649 --> 01:52:42,608
[Max] Adonis creed knows
there is no way around Viktor drago.

1658
01:52:42,695 --> 01:52:44,310
He has to go through him.

1659
01:52:46,115 --> 01:52:47,230
Dig!

1660
01:52:48,283 --> 01:52:49,568
Dig! Dig!

1661
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,300
[Jim] Creed suddenly finding
another gear!

1662
01:52:53,497 --> 01:52:54,862
[Jim] Drago's on his heels.

1663
01:52:55,499 --> 01:52:56,830
[Crowd exclaims]

1664
01:52:58,210 --> 01:52:59,700
[Yells]

1665
01:53:00,254 --> 01:53:02,119
And down goes drago!

1666
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:04,420
[Cheering]

1667
01:53:04,508 --> 01:53:06,169
That's it! That's right!

1668
01:53:07,636 --> 01:53:09,172
[Max] What a wild turn of events.

1669
01:53:10,347 --> 01:53:11,347
[In Russian]

1670
01:53:12,474 --> 01:53:13,554
[Referee] Two.

1671
01:53:14,309 --> 01:53:16,174
Donnie, he gets up, you go after him.

1672
01:53:16,270 --> 01:53:17,350
[Referee] Three.

1673
01:53:18,939 --> 01:53:20,019
Four.

1674
01:53:22,067 --> 01:53:23,227
Five.

1675
01:53:25,237 --> 01:53:27,319
- Six.
- [Jim] Drago beats the count.

1676
01:53:27,406 --> 01:53:31,274
[Max] I can't believe either of
these guys are still on their feet.

1677
01:53:36,457 --> 01:53:37,663
[Referee] Box.

1678
01:53:42,337 --> 01:53:46,250
[Jim] Drago seemingly so far ahead
on points, he just needs to stay upright

1679
01:53:46,341 --> 01:53:47,877
and make it to the end.

1680
01:53:48,385 --> 01:53:51,843
Here comes creed again,
driving drago back into the ropes.

1681
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:53,420
- Dig! Dig! Dig!
- Yeah!

1682
01:53:56,393 --> 01:53:57,678
Come on, take him down!

1683
01:53:59,229 --> 01:54:00,309
Come on, baby.

1684
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:06,266
[Max] And Viktor drago is down!

1685
01:54:06,361 --> 01:54:07,521
Again!

1686
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:10,396
- What a turn this fight has taken.
- [Inaudible conversation]

1687
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:20,990
[Panting heavily]

1688
01:54:21,085 --> 01:54:23,497
[Jim] Creed doubled over in pain

1689
01:54:23,587 --> 01:54:26,374
as drago tries to
pick himself up off the floor.

1690
01:54:29,468 --> 01:54:32,710
[Counting down in Russian]

1691
01:54:39,186 --> 01:54:40,892

[Referee continues counting down]

1694
01:54:56,328 --> 01:55:00,037
[Max] Drago summons the strength,
manages to make the count.

1695
01:55:00,999 --> 01:55:02,409
[Panting]

1696
01:55:06,255 --> 01:55:07,836
[Crowd cheering]

1697
01:55:14,138 --> 01:55:15,878
[Jim] They're still swinging, Max.

1698
01:55:16,598 --> 01:55:18,589
[Max] Creed continuing to connect.

1699
01:55:18,684 --> 01:55:21,221
And this is becoming hard to watch, Jim.

1700
01:55:21,478 --> 01:55:23,685
I don't think drago has anything left,

1701
01:55:23,772 --> 01:55:26,013
but he refuses to give up.

1702
01:55:50,299 --> 01:55:52,130
And that's it! It's over!

1703
01:55:52,217 --> 01:55:53,217
[Bell dings]

1704
01:55:53,302 --> 01:55:55,668
[Jim] Drago's corner
throws in the towel.

1705
01:55:55,762 --> 01:55:59,175
[Max] And Adonis creed
defends his title.

1706
01:55:59,266 --> 01:56:00,927
Defends his name.

1707
01:56:01,018 --> 01:56:03,179
Creates his own legacy.

1708
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:07,309
He is still the heavyweight champion
of the world.

1709
01:56:08,901 --> 01:56:13,941
[Jim] And the Russian crowd is standing
and cheering for the American fighter.

1710
01:56:14,031 --> 01:56:15,692
[Crowd applauds]

1711
01:56:24,958 --> 01:56:26,539
[Speaks Russian]

1712

Where's b at? Where's b?

1713
01:56:30,964 --> 01:56:32,920
- [Grunts in pain]
- Easy, easy, easy.

1714
01:56:33,008 --> 01:56:35,875
Hey, back up. Everybody back up.
We need air.

1715
01:56:36,678 --> 01:56:37,838
[Sniffs] Yeah.

1716
01:56:41,308 --> 01:56:42,988
- [Adonis] We did it.
- [Bianca] We did it.

1717
01:56:49,441 --> 01:56:50,681
[Shiffling]

1718
01:56:54,112 --> 01:56:55,272

[Viktor crying]

1721
01:57:07,084 --> 01:57:08,745
- Let's go home.
- Let's go, d.

1722
01:57:15,801 --> 01:57:17,837
[Panting] I'm good, ma. I'm good.

1723
01:57:22,808 --> 01:57:24,423
[Groans]

1724
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:27,767
- I did it. 1 did it.
- [Little Duke] You did it.

1725
01:57:27,938 --> 01:57:29,269
Hey, unc.

1726
01:57:39,241 --> 01:57:40,447
[Sniffs]

1727
01:57:42,536 --> 01:57:44,276
It's your time.

1728
01:58:02,347 --> 01:58:04,508
Hey, okay, back up.

1729
01:58:16,778 --> 01:58:18,894
[Crowd cheering and applauding]

1730
01:58:43,472 --> 01:58:44,803
What's up, pops?

1731
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:50,220
[Stammers]

1732
01:58:50,312 --> 01:58:52,803
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come see you.

1733
01:58:56,526 --> 01:58:57,766
[Sighs]

1734
01:58:58,236 --> 01:59:00,727
I'm not sure how
this is supposed to go. Um...

1735
01:59:04,409 --> 01:59:06,991
I guess I should tell you that
mom's doing pretty good.

1736
01:59:07,621 --> 01:59:09,953
You know, she's holding up.

1737
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:13,410
So is rocky.

1738
01:59:14,544 --> 01:59:15,772
- [Rocky] Thanks a lot.
- [Driver] Thank you.

1739
01:59:15,796 --> 01:59:17,036
[Adonis] He's a tough dude.

1740
01:59:19,049 --> 01:59:21,005
I can see why you liked him.

1741
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:26,177
I also see why
you wanted to fight him, too.

1742
01:59:26,765 --> 01:59:28,005
[Chuckles softly]

1743
01:59:35,649 --> 01:59:37,014
Look, um,

1744
01:59:39,236 --> 01:59:41,352
I just came here to tell you that...

1745
01:59:47,953 --> 01:59:49,443
That I did it.

1746
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:55,327
But I didn't do it for you.

1747
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,416
Or because of them.

1748
02:00:02,717 --> 02:00:05,880
I did it because it was my fight.

1749
02:00:08,181 --> 02:00:09,842
And when I stepped into that ring,

1750
02:00:12,894 --> 02:00:14,509
it wasn't just about me.

1751
02:00:17,858 --> 02:00:18,858
Hello.

1752
02:00:21,486 --> 02:00:22,726
You must be Logan.

1753
02:00:23,029 --> 02:00:24,269
Yes. Who are you?

1754
02:00:24,573 --> 02:00:25,858
[Robert] Lo, who is it?

1755
02:00:26,825 --> 02:00:29,737
[Adonis] Sometimes we think
we have to do it all on our own.

1756
02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:31,610
Hey, Robert.

1757
02:00:32,998 --> 02:00:34,204
[Adonis] But we don't.

1758
02:00:35,834 --> 02:00:38,701
I was just around
in the neighborhood, so...

1759
02:00:45,051 --> 02:00:46,712
This is your grandfather.

1760
02:00:53,059 --> 02:00:54,265
[Sighs]

1761
02:00:58,398 --> 02:01:01,481
You look just like his mother.

1762
02:01:02,068 --> 02:01:03,148
[Robert chuckles]

1763
02:01:03,904 --> 02:01:05,235
Yeah, I know.

1764
02:01:12,496 --> 02:01:14,612
I wanna introduce you to somebody.

1765
02:01:25,509 --> 02:01:27,045
Do you wanna come inside?

1766
02:01:34,726 --> 02:01:35,886
