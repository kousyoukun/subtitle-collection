Subtitles by explosiveskull

3
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,638
Yeah. We got this.

4
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:19,507
<i>...here at
the MGM Grand tonight, Roy.</i>

5
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,279
<i>And, you know, when Adonis Creed
lost to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan,</i>

6
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:26,282
<i>he was really a curiosity
more than anything else.</i>

7
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:28,184
<i>But that was an epic fight,</i>

8
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,485
<i>and since then, he's reeled
off six straight wins,</i>

9
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:34,856
<i>and tonight attempts against
Danny "The Stuntman" Wheeler</i>

10
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,227
<i>to become the heavyweight
champion of the world.</i>

11
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:42,264
<i>It bears mentioning that Creed
actually wagered his Mustang</i>

12
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,666
<i>before their
sparring session, Roy.</i>

13
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:48,803
<i>And rumor has it that same
Mustang is on the line again tonight.</i>

14
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:52,242
Okay, everybody out.
Let's go.

15
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:58,481
- Hey.
- Hey.

16
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:00,382
- Feel good?
- Mmm-hmm.

17
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,085
Yeah. Remember to
keep your right hand up, okay?

18
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,922
His left is just as strong
as his right.

19
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:07,924
- Yep.
- Yeah.

20
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:16,806
Did you take a shit yet?

21
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,203
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Okay, good.

22
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,674
It's just another fight, okay?

23
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:29,179
You got this.

24
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:44,927
You know, there's only
three steps into that ring.

25
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,196
Just three.

26
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:51,634
And tonight, it's gonna
look as high as a mountain.

27
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:57,304
And when you climb
through them ropes,

28
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,507
it's gonna be the loneliest
place in the world

29
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,776
because you're gonna be
in there with another fighter

30
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,113
who wants to take you out.

31
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,915
So now,
you gotta ask yourself,

32
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,352
are you here to prove
something to other people

33
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,290
or prove something
to yourself?

34
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:19,929
To myself.

35
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:22,630
Right.

36
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,966
Now, let me ask you something.

37
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,969
What?

38
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,603
What's with the hair?

39
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:34,208
I combed it.
It's a special night.

40
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,246
Shouldn't you be thinking
about something else, wise guy?

41
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,650
Now, you can go prove it.

42
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:46,353
Now go get your Mustang back.

43
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,492
These guys have really been
mixing it up here in the fourth.

44
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,894
So far, Creed's youth
outweighing Wheeler's experience.

45
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:56,863
Let's go! Let's go, baby.
Let's o!

46
00:06:56,865 --> 00:07:00,567
Maybe the most amazing part
of Adonis Creed's journey, Roy...

47
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,101
Don't drop that guard! Sit.

48
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:03,436
...is that tonight,
he fights...

49
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:05,404
Keep your hands up!

50
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:06,873
...for the same belt held by
both his trainer, Rocky Balboa,

51
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,809
and his father,
the great Apollo Creed.

52
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:11,711
Whoo!

53
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:14,881
Wheeler seems to be waking up.
We've seen this before, Roy.

54
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:18,153
When Wheeler smells blood,
he really turns it on.

55
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,094
Come on back.

56
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,103
Come on, D!

57
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:39,071
Three years ago,
that's a knockout.

58
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,377
Wheeler's power just isn't the same,
and no doubt Creed can sense it.

59
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,578
You got him. Stay on him!

60
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,847
Creed's on a mission,
really pressing the issue now.

61
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,617
And a big left hook
lands flush!

62
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:55,321
Creed staying in the pocket, Max.
Moving, not running.

63
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,255
Come on, now!
Hands up! Hands up!

64
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,724
These two men
are really going at it.

65
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,561
Tell him, Donnie!

66
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:02,827
Another left hook
drives Wheeler back.

67
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,064
Come on, baby!

68
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,133
That was a sneaky little
uppercut on the inside,

69
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,868
and Wheeler's hurt
by that, Roy.

70
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,469
Yeah, that wobbled
his legs pretty bad.

71
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:13,639
- Another big shot!
- Hold him, hold him, hold him!

72
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,273
Creed has him
in trouble, Max.

73
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,010
Wheeler's doing
what he can...

74
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:21,813
Wheeler is down!

75
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,315
Wheeler has hit the canvas!

76
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:24,950
Now stay there, boy!

77
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,518
Creed taught you!

78
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,953
Come and give me my keys!

79
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:30,222
Get up! Come on, baby!

80
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:31,690
Get up, get up!

81
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,325
- Wheeler, trying to get up.
- One!

82
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:35,026
- Stay down!
- Two!

83
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,494
I don't know
if he makes this count, Roy.

84
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:37,861
Three!

85
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,099
Four!

86
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,199
Five!

87
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,202
Six!

88
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:44,469
Seven!

89
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:45,472
Eight!

90
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,706
Nine!

91
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,139
That's it. That's it.

92
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,409
And it's over, Max.

93
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,678
No way! Adonis Creed...

94
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,347
Give me my keys!

95
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:58,017
...is the heavyweight
champion of the world.

96
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,720
You know what you just did?

97
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:02,987
Yeah.

98
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,423
Baby, you know
what just happened?

99
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:12,229
When you think of
where this kid has come from,

100
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:15,933
the most unlikely beginning
for a fighter, Roy.

101
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,669
Growing up the way he did

102
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,904
to make it to the top
of boxing in this way...

103
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:22,273
It's unprecedented!

104
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,241
Creed! Creed! Creed!

105
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:27,044
It's one thing to be
the number one contender.

106
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:30,147
It's a whole other thing
to be champion.

107
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,754
This is the first step to
building a legacy of his own,

108
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:41,860
and I can hardly wait to see
what's next for Adonis Creed.

109
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,731
Whoa.

110
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,133
I mean, what do you think?

111
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,634
That's...

112
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:52,403
That is beautiful.

113
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,637
- Right?
- Yeah.

114
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,239
But we gotta hurry up.

115
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,839
I mean, she's about to
get out the shower any second.

116
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,841
Yo, Donnie, why didn't you
tell me about this before?

117
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,043
I didn't know
if I was gonna win.

118
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:02,011
What's that got to do with it?

119
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,013
I don't know.

120
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:06,082
Look, just tell me
what I should do.

121
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,619
You get down on one knee.

122
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:09,852
People still do that shit?

123
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:11,522
You can always
send her a text.

124
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:14,190
Come on, Unc,
I'm being serious, all right?

125
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,659
I mean, what did you say?

126
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,727
- To Adrian?
- Yeah.

127
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,828
It was a long time ago.

128
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,198
We were at the zoo.
It was winter. It was snowing.

129
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Everything smelled fresh.

130
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:27,470
There was this tiger.
He had snow on its back.

131
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:30,239
- And he's walking in the background.
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

132
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:31,809
Just tell me what you said.

133
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,543
Well, I was getting
to that part.

134
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,278
What I said is...

135
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,281
I asked if she would not mind
marrying me very much,

136
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:42,752
which is kind of a dumb way
of saying she's my world,

137
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:45,423
and she made me better
than I deserved to be.

138
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:47,958
You know?

139
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,494
Yeah.

140
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:54,330
Listen, why don't you
just turn off your brain

141
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:56,401
and let your heart
do the talking.

142
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:58,236
Click.

143
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:01,270
You'll do good.

144
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,240
- Turn my brain off?
- Yeah.

145
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,610
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

146
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,511
- All right.
- All right.

147
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,947
All right, I'm on it.

148
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:18,188
- Hey, Unc.
- Mmm.

149
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,190
You good?

150
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,561
Yeah, real good. Thank you.

151
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:26,997
- Great.
- All right.

152
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:54,525
Will you marry me?

153
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:09,038
Listen, B.

154
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,874
I know we've been
dating for a few years now,

155
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:16,076
and it's just something
about us that just click.

156
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:17,913
I don't know
how to explain it,

157
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:22,016
but the feeling I get when
you're by my side is a feeling

158
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:24,952
that I can't live without.

159
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:28,222
I know I sound crazy, but, look,
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

160
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:35,563
Will you marry me?

161
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,231
I'm still hungry, babe,

162
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,568
I don't know why.

163
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,106
Are you for real, D?

164
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,841
Yeah, I'm for real.

165
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,609
No, stop playin'.

166
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:49,745
I ain't playin'.

167
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:53,049
You didn't hear any of that?

168
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,051
None of what?

169
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,222
Hmm.

170
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,259
None of what, D?

171
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,102
What did you say?

172
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,542
Nothing that you don't
already know.

173
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,245
Remind me.

174
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,548
I said that I love you,

175
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,253
and that I need you.

176
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,823
D, do you know
what you're doing right now?

177
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,223
I mean, yeah, kind of.

178
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:38,693
What do you mean, "kind of"?

179
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:42,430
Babe!

180
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,430
I mean...

181
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,268
To keep it real with you, B,

182
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,437
you're the only person

183
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,440
I wanna share my moments with.

184
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:57,445
So, Bianca Taylor,

185
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,254
will you marry me?

186
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,155
Yo.

187
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,595
Yo.

188
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:17,497
- "Yo"? Is that a yes?
- Yes.

189
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:18,598
It's yes?

190
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,867
Yes!

191
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:22,102
Yeah.

192
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,156
Viktor.

193
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,770
When you're done, unload the cement.

194
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:53,860
Our boy's
looking good.

195
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:57,697
I'm sure you heard
the good news.

196
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,766
It's time.

197
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,140
You ever thought
about going back to LA?

198
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,377
Please, you're a Philly girl.

199
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,813
Yeah, I guess,

200
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,148
but it'd be nice
to have more space.

201
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,282
And your mom's out there...

202
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:21,719
And them labels, too.

203
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:24,155
Could help me get my
music out to more people.

204
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,256
Hmm.

205
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:29,862
I don't know, I feel like I've done
everything I could in Philly, you know?

206
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:35,968
Time ain't exactly on my side,
you know?

207
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:40,405
Mmm-hmm.

208
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:46,311
What about Rocky?

209
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,513
Rocky has his life, D.

210
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,951
We gotta start ours.

211
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,824
<i>It's a cold one today,
Adrian, that's for sure.</i>

212
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:39,028
I tried calling our son Bobby
a few times.

213
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,798
But I'd hang up every time
he was about to pick up

214
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,535
because, to tell you the truth,
I didn't know what to say to him.

215
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:47,636
What if he's moving on,

216
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:50,272
and I'm like this chunk of
yesterday trying to be today?

217
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:51,542
I just don't fit in.

218
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,646
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

219
00:17:57,215 --> 00:18:01,683
Knock on his door and say,
"Hey, how you doing?

220
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:05,556
"What's it been, a lot
of years?" I don't know.

221
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:19,870
I miss you.

222
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:18,061
You've been hype
ever since you got this jawn.

223
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,361
What are you talking about?

224
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:21,831
That smile right there.

225
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:24,432
You're cheezin'.

226
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:26,335
It's the only thing
my pops left me.

227
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,502
I mean, that and these hands.

228
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:32,874
- You never told me that.
- Yeah.

229
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,612
What's up with you
and these secrets, Don?

230
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:46,155
How're you doing?
All right, all right.

231
00:19:47,724 --> 00:19:49,924
But look at this, here.

232
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,761
- How you doing?
- Hey.

233
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:56,663
- Hey, Isabelle.
- Hey, Rock.

234
00:19:56,665 --> 00:20:00,867
Hey, listen. Some big guy's sitting
over there, waiting for you.

235
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,604
He said you'll know who he is.

236
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,342
Yo, champ.

237
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:11,611
You gotta take that fight, man.
Shut this dude up.

238
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:13,647
No, Wheeler
still talking shit?

239
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:15,216
It's a little early
for a rematch, bro.

240
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:18,252
Hey, turn the TV up.

241
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:20,956
<i>...and the tragic
history that connects them.</i>

242
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,470
That you?

243
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,475
Nice pictures.

244
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:44,880
Yeah, they're okay.

245
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:49,985
No pictures of me.

246
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:52,921
No, there's no pictures
of that.

247
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:57,192
Why are you in Philly?

248
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,493
You don't know?

249
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:05,464
<i>Ukrainian boxer Viktor Drago
appeared today in Philadelphia</i>

250
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,434
<i>to issue
a very public challenge</i>

251
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:10,569
<i>to recently crowned heavyweight
champion Adonis Creed.</i>

252
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:14,640
<i>A press conference was held earlier
by boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle.</i>

253
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:17,977
<i>We came all the way to Philly
to let you know it's serious.</i>

254
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:20,980
<i>Now, this man here,
he ain't no Danny Wheeler.</i>

255
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:25,584
<i>And let's be honest, Creed fought
him three years too late, anyway.</i>

256
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:26,821
<i>Easy match.</i>

257
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:30,124
<i>People in this country
love you.</i>

258
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:34,862
But Russia,

259
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:38,933
no one touch
Drago name.

260
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,936
Everything changed that night.

261
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,039
Look, you know, that's like

262
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,875
a million years ago.

263
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,443
Like yesterday to me.

264
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:55,613
So, you came all the way
over here to tell me that?

265
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,884
<i>It's no coincidence
that Ivan Drago's son shows up</i>

266
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:01,854
<i>right after Apollo Creed's son
claims the belt.</i>

267
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:05,024
<i>This is Creed versus Drago.</i>

268
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:07,558
<i>This is the fight
the whole world wants to see.</i>

269
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,894
And this is the fight
he should take.

270
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,597
Unless he's afraid of
history repeating itself.

271
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,733
<i>That history
being the infamous 1985 match</i>

272
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:20,172
<i>in which boxing legend Apollo
Creed was killed by Russian fighter</i>

273
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:21,873
<i>Ivan Drago.</i>

274
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,876
<i>Apollo's trainer Rocky Balboa
was heavily criticized</i>

275
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:26,746
<i>for failing
to stop that fight.</i>

276
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:29,182
D. Baby.

277
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,952
It's a publicity stunt.

278
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:37,588
Don't worry about that.

279
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,690
<i>And let's not forget,</i>

280
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:44,197
<i>later that year, Balboa defeated
Drago in his own backyard, Russia.</i>

281
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,902
<i>Because of you,
I lose everything.</i>

282
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,771
Country.

283
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:53,973
Respect.

284
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,711
Wife.

285
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,349
You ever see stray dogs
in Ukraine?

286
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,118
They go for days with no food.

287
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,121
People spit on them.
They have nothing.

288
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:11,888
No home.

289
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,994
Only will to survive,
to fight.

290
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,999
I have son.

291
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,173
All he knows

292
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,642
is this.

293
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,151
My son will break your boy.

294
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:41,954
Been a long day.

295
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,657
I think we're done here.

296
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,130
Because around here
we put strays away.

297
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,279
Hmm.

298
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,256
It's good picture.

299
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,765
I kind of figured
you'd be here.

300
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:33,372
You know, I tried calling and calling,
but nobody picked up or anything.

301
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:41,110
Kind of early to be training,
don't you think, after a fight?

302
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,713
Just trying to clear my head.

303
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,381
I get that.

304
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,783
Cheaper than a shrink,
that's for sure.

305
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,755
Hey, Don, come on.
I heard what's going on.

306
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,959
But you can't let them
get inside.

307
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,761
But I know how you're feeling.

308
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,064
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

309
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:06,037
What happened a long time ago, that
ain't got nothing to do with you.

310
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,441
Listen, that fight is
what Apollo wanted, all right?

311
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:14,343
It shouldn't have happened.

312
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:15,346
But it did.

313
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,749
And you gotta let it go.

314
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:22,351
Come on.

315
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:28,591
You've seen him fight, though?

316
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,893
I've seen him on sports TV
and stuff like that.

317
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:34,164
He's big, but he's raw.

318
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,969
He ain't no mean machine
like you are, that's for sure.

319
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,437
You know what?

320
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,005
I'm gonna cheer you up, 'cause
today's gonna be your lucky day.

321
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,974
Christmas just came early
for you,

322
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:48,076
'cause I'm gonna hold the bag,
lucky guy.

323
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,044
- No, you're the one who's lucky.
- How's that?

324
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:51,580
'Cause I'm gonna let you
hold the bag for me.

325
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:53,181
Yo.

326
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,352
That's it. That's better.

327
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:29,286
<i>Creed taking major hits.
This could be over soon.</i>

328
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:35,124
<i>Creed is down!
And he could be badly hurt.</i>

329
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,693
<i>Apollo on the floor
looking unresponsive.</i>

330
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:40,129
<i>This doesn't look good.</i>

331
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,333
<i>There is no movement.</i>

332
00:26:56,312 --> 00:26:59,379
<i>♪ Glitter in
my eyes And I was young</i>

333
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:04,017
<i>♪ Know what they say
I ran away from home</i>

334
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:07,854
<i>♪ I thank you
I learned the world</i>

335
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,325
<i>♪ Hoo hoo, yeah</i>

336
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:13,994
<i>♪ They think I'm a broken girl</i>

337
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:16,296
<i>♪ Hoo hoo, yeah</i>

338
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:19,535
<i>♪ I think I'm in love
with lost</i>

339
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,369
Amazing voice.

340
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:25,940
<i>♪ My heart cracked
But at least it's touched ♪</i>

341
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,410
Sorry for the theatrics.

342
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,146
But people like a good show.

343
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:34,147
That was a grimy move, brah.

344
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:35,948
Ain't nothing personal.

345
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,751
Can't say I'm proud of
what our sport's become,

346
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:39,985
but that's the game.

347
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:41,655
Call it whatever you want.

348
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:44,291
Sounds to me like
you just trying to get paid.

349
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:45,960
The money is a side effect.

350
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:51,230
"The Rumble in the Jungle"
didn't just manifest itself.

351
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:53,165
Somebody had to
make it happen.

352
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,900
Will it into existence.

353
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:56,803
Oh, yeah, that's supposed
to be you, huh?

354
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:59,240
You see anybody else standing
here with a care in their heart?

355
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:02,843
I want the same thing
you want.

356
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:04,479
Yeah? What's that?

357
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,181
In the history of boxing,

358
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:12,017
there have been
77 heavyweight champions.

359
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:13,287
You know that?

360
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:16,290
But how many
do you think they know?

361
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:18,659
Four?

362
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:20,428
Five?

363
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:26,565
The belt ain't enough.

364
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,070
You need a narrative. Something
that sticks to the ribs.

365
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:33,839
Your dad, he knew that.

366
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:35,510
Do yourself a favor, brah,

367
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,011
and quit while you ahead.

368
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:40,181
Self-preservation.

369
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:43,984
At least you got that
over your old man.

370
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:50,223
That must be Rocky
whispering in your ear.

371
00:28:58,165 --> 00:28:59,433
I'm serious.

372
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:02,568
Amazing voice.

373
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,670
Yo, thank you,
Fillmore.

374
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,573
For real though, thank you.

375
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:20,785
How you doing, kid?

376
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:22,255
We gotta talk.

377
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:26,092
Let's take a walk
and get some air.

378
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,197
Okay? Kind of stuffy in here.

379
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:33,097
Look at that light.

380
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:35,066
That thing's been broken
for a couple of years.

381
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:37,034
It's driving me crazy.

382
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,637
City won't fix it or nothing.

383
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,675
What good is a light

384
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:45,008
that don't light, right?

385
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,714
Kind of funny,
but it's stupid, too.

386
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:49,483
Hey.

387
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:52,151
I gotta take the fight.

388
00:29:58,057 --> 00:29:59,858
Why?

389
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,659
These dudes killed my pops.

390
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:04,328
Now they're parading around,
talking shit?

391
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,599
I can't let that slide.

392
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:09,435
I'm the champ, right?

393
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:11,836
Yeah.

394
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:13,403
So I ain't got a choice.

395
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:14,406
Choice?

396
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:18,075
That's the same thing
your father said,

397
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:21,078
and he died right here,
in my hands.

398
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,313
Look what his choice
put your mother through.

399
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:26,350
You don't wanna really bring all
that stuff up again, do you, kid?

400
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:28,151
I thought you would get it.

401
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:31,088
If I don't take this fight,
I gotta live with it right now.

402
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,024
That kid was raised in hate,
you know what I'm talking about?

403
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:35,926
You weren't. Don't do it.

404
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,361
- But you did.
- It's different.

405
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:38,564
It was different?

406
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,300
It's a lot different.

407
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,836
I was supposed to be in there
with Drago that night

408
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:47,738
and not your father.

409
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,675
And I could've
thrown in the towel,

410
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:52,376
but I didn't.

411
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:54,578
And I gotta live with that.

412
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,947
And when I did
get in that ring,

413
00:30:56,949 --> 00:30:59,950
that guy broke things in me

414
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:01,520
that ain't never been fixed.

415
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,525
It's not worth it.

416
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:09,360
Not at all.

417
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:14,031
Why do you wanna fight?

418
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,933
What are you talking about?
I just told you why.

419
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:17,366
No, you didn't, Donnie.

420
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:19,368
Why do you wanna fight?

421
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,237
I get why
they wanna fight you.

422
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,638
I know what
they're fighting for.

423
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,741
What about you?

424
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,510
Listen to me,
you got everything to lose.

425
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,245
He's got nothing to lose.

426
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:31,681
When a fighter ain't got
nothing to lose, he's dangerous.

427
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:32,784
I'm dangerous!

428
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:43,659
You think I'm gonna lose.

429
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:44,829
I didn't say that.

430
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,766
Same guy that said he ain't
have enough experience.

431
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,836
- Raw, right?
- Yeah.

432
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,038
But you don't think
I could beat him.

433
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,540
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- No.

434
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,941
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

435
00:31:58,943 --> 00:32:01,109
I'm saying
I'm not gonna be here forever.

436
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:02,545
And what's that
supposed to mean?

437
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,447
That means you gotta
do some smart thinking.

438
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:06,517
Oh, you wanna talk about
smart decisions, Rock?

439
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:09,552
You in this house all alone.

440
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,453
Who been taking
care of you? Me.

441
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:12,890
I've been here for you!

442
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:15,727
Who else you got?

443
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:22,633
Listen.

444
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,603
I'm taking this fight
with or without you.

445
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:40,484
It's gotta be without.

446
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,119
I can't do it.

447
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:44,454
So that's it?

448
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:46,790
You walkin' out on me?

449
00:32:50,027 --> 00:32:52,863
At least you ain't gotta worry about
throwing in the towel this time.

450
00:32:57,968 --> 00:32:59,168
Yeah.

451
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,273
Yeah.

452
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,171
D, are you okay?

453
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:37,905
Rocky, man.

454
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:39,206
Rocky what?

455
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,676
He ain't training me
for the fight.

456
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,244
Wait, you're taking the fight?

457
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:45,913
All the shit
that we've been through.

458
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:48,582
He gonna leave me high and dry.
That's bullshit!

459
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:50,451
I took care of him
when he had cancer.

460
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:52,086
He could've been dead, B.

461
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:53,821
I'm sure he has his reasons.

462
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,890
Oh, yeah? Like what?

463
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:57,426
Like what?

464
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:02,898
I don't need him.

465
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:51,746
Yo.

466
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:57,852
I love it.

467
00:34:58,386 --> 00:34:59,852
Me, too.

468
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:03,422
I want just a little piece
of that room for a studio.

469
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:04,859
That works. It's all you.

470
00:35:06,795 --> 00:35:08,461
What's wrong?

471
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:10,496
I don't know. Maybe I'm just a
little tired from the flight.

472
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:11,564
I'm okay.

473
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:12,865
We don't have to go out.

474
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:15,535
We can just stay in,
order some food.

475
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:19,406
Hmm. No, baby,
you have to tell her.

476
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:31,318
So, how's the music?

477
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,888
Oh, Donnie didn't tell you?

478
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:37,058
D?

479
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:39,760
Uh... I forgot.

480
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,931
Oh. Yeah, I signed.

481
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,764
Hello.

482
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:47,599
Yeah, it's great. The record label
really hit the ground running, too.

483
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:49,202
I'm up for festivals
this summer.

484
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:52,138
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

485
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:01,915
So, how's Rocky?

486
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:04,549
He didn't wanna make the trip?

487
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:06,987
Nah, Ma, you know how he is

488
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:09,122
with the traveling.

489
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:23,070
Okay, Ma.

490
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:27,172
I'm sure you already
guessed it, but...

491
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:28,374
Oh, yeah.

492
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:30,409
I already know.

493
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:35,648
All the salt,

494
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:38,384
shiny hair,

495
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:41,088
glowing skin.

496
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:45,125
How far along are you?

497
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:46,893
Mmm?

498
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:50,496
Ma, you think...

499
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:52,163
You think...

500
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:53,998
Uh-uh.

501
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,001
No.

502
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:57,401
We couldn't even... No.

503
00:36:57,403 --> 00:36:58,802
Your mamma's got jokes, okay.

504
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:01,174
No, I'm not.

505
00:37:02,141 --> 00:37:03,407
All right.

506
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:04,777
Mmm-mmm.

507
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,920
- What's it say?
- D, don't touch it.

508
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:17,955
No, I don't care if you peed on it.
I just want to see...

509
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:19,525
I don't want you
to mess it up.

510
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:23,162
What's it say?

511
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:27,430
It's two blue lines.

512
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:31,101
Two blue lines?
What does that mean?

513
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,537
Two blue lines.

514
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,145
Maybe it's broke.

515
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:53,357
That's crazy.

516
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,726
Mmm-hmm.

517
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:57,862
Hell, I don't know, D.

518
00:38:00,598 --> 00:38:02,067
Baby, I don't know.

519
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:09,839
You did say you always
wanted kids, right?

520
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:11,476
Yeah, but I didn't say
so soon.

521
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,212
I don't know if I'm...

522
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:19,684
If we are ready.

523
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:32,897
Let's get ready, then.

524
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:38,236
Yeah.

525
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:47,410
<i>Did she tell her family yet?</i>

526
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:50,679
She's, uh, on the phone
with her aunt right now.

527
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,049
Oh, that Bianca's a good one.

528
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:56,021
Why she agreed to marry you,
I do not know.

529
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,223
I don't know either.

530
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,695
Oh, it's good
to have you home.

531
00:39:06,663 --> 00:39:07,865
Ma, um...

532
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:12,770
That fight

533
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:16,073
between me

534
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:19,209
and Ivan Drago's son...

535
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,715
I'm gonna take it.

536
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:26,917
Okay.

537
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:32,821
That's it?

538
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:34,356
What else is there to say?

539
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:35,690
So, that doesn't bother you?

540
00:39:35,692 --> 00:39:37,261
Oh, you think
this doesn't bother me?

541
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:40,495
You're a grown man.

542
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:43,498
It doesn't matter
what I or anyone else thinks.

543
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,301
You wanna fight this man,
that's your business.

544
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:48,138
You don't need my blessings.

545
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,739
You clearly
don't have Rocky's.

546
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:53,110
Rocky don't get it.

547
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,013
It wasn't his dad.

548
00:39:58,748 --> 00:40:00,117
It changed my life.

549
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,117
Your life.

550
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,617
You're telling me
you don't miss him?

551
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,554
Excuse me!

552
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:07,054
Do not try to make this
about me.

553
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:09,890
And don't pretend
that it's about your father.

554
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:12,527
You became the world champion
without him.

555
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:15,763
Then why don't I feel like it?

556
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:19,335
If your father was here, he would tell
you he didn't feel like it either.

557
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:21,704
But he's not.

558
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,010
I just hope
you'll be here for your child.

559
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,352
Why are you so stupid?

560
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:41,822
Stop.

561
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:44,191
D, you're tickling me
with that fake beard.

562
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:45,727
The disrespect.

563
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,699
Why don't you sing for us?

564
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,236
No, I am not your jukebox.

565
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:57,937
I'm not gonna be walking around
here, barefoot and pregnant,

566
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,473
making you sandwiches either.

567
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:02,476
Did you hear that?
No sandwiches, no singing.

568
00:41:04,614 --> 00:41:05,945
Your mamma just hating on us.

569
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:07,383
Did you hear that?

570
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:13,021
What if the baby can't, D?

571
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,790
Can't what?

572
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:17,726
Can't hear.

573
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,731
You know it can be
hereditary, right?

574
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:28,770
Mmm.

575
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:31,940
Everything is gonna be fine.

576
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:34,676
I promise.

577
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:01,401
<i>People are gonna
be all over this fight.</i>

578
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:04,172
It got a lot
of bad history, man.

579
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:06,606
Everything.

580
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:07,806
Your dad.

581
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:09,144
And yours, too.

582
00:42:10,212 --> 00:42:11,879
Don't forget
that he trained him.

583
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:15,914
I know why you didn't
train me before.

584
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,450
I wasn't ready.

585
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,084
You was right.

586
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:21,188
Yeah, but this is different.

587
00:42:23,658 --> 00:42:25,427
<i>Drago's kid...</i>

588
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:27,928
<i>Big.</i>

589
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,163
<i>Fast.</i>

590
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:32,199
Strong.

591
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,168
Unorthodox.

592
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:39,006
<i>He's a monster, boy.</i>

593
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:44,476
It's a balanced breakfast
over there.

594
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,511
You think you ready
for all that?

595
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:47,748
I gotta be.

596
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:53,287
But if you ain't gonna
do it for me,

597
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:56,490
at least do it for them.

598
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:03,828
Think about it.

599
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,331
<i>Beat what they couldn't beat.</i>

600
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,268
<i>Change the way
they were remembered.</i>

601
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,174
This is our chance
to rewrite history.

602
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:20,146
<i>Our history.</i>

603
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:25,530
When I say run faster...

604
00:43:27,155 --> 00:43:29,614
...run faster.

605
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:34,693
<i>His record might
be light, but, believe me,</i>

606
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,994
<i>he ain't no undercard.</i>

607
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:39,098
So, you gotta be with me.

608
00:43:40,033 --> 00:43:41,968
I'm right here.

609
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:46,939
We'll see.

610
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:54,180
We'll see.

611
00:44:25,877 --> 00:44:29,012
<i>Creed versus Drago.</i>

612
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:30,914
<i>That means something.</i>

613
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:34,150
<i>Did that factor into your
decision to take this fight?</i>

614
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:36,654
I mean, you can't say Creed
without Drago, right?

615
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:39,022
This is what y'all want.

616
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:41,091
It's what everyone wants.

617
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:42,892
<i>Also, can't help
but to notice,</i>

618
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:46,262
<i>who won't be in your corner
this time around.</i>

619
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:48,098
<i>Rocky's taking
some family time.</i>

620
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,767
<i>But Duke's got me.</i>

621
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:51,501
<i>His father taught my father
everything he knows.</i>

622
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:53,670
Speed, D.
That's how we gonna beat him.

623
00:44:53,672 --> 00:44:55,773
<i>Technique, speed...</i>

624
00:44:55,775 --> 00:44:59,609
<i>I'm confident he'll have me
ready for this fight.</i>

625
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:03,279
<i>And knowing what happened
between your father and Drago,</i>

626
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:05,682
<i>you must have some worry.</i>

627
00:45:05,684 --> 00:45:07,586
What would I be afraid of?

628
00:45:09,254 --> 00:45:10,953
I'm a fighter.
This is what I do, right?

629
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:12,522
Who the champ?

630
00:45:12,524 --> 00:45:13,989
It's who I am.

631
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:16,395
Looking good!

632
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:46,056
Creed! Creed! Creed!

633
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:03,941
You're much smaller
than your father.

634
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:07,009
Don't you talk about my pop.

635
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:12,681
Hey, we could do this
right here, bro.

636
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:13,782
- Step up here!
- D!

637
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:15,250
He can't help you no more!

638
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:16,819
You hear me? He can't help
behind that ring!

639
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:19,022
You stand there. All you're
doing is talking, homie.

640
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:22,524
Your pops can't protect you,
you feel me?

641
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:25,260
Don't talk about my father!
Don't turn your back on me!

642
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,163
You in my house, homie!

643
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:53,423
Make sure they hold them down.
We're in the dressing room.

644
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,727
<i>Jim Lampley here,
along with Roy Jones.</i>

645
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:02,029
<i>We're moments away
from tonight's main event.</i>

646
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:04,732
<i>Jim, I would have never
thought in a million years</i>

647
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:07,702
I'd witness another
Creed versus Drago fight.

648
00:47:07,704 --> 00:47:10,671
Well, get ready, Roy.
Drago makes his way to the ring.

649
00:47:10,673 --> 00:47:14,242
His father leads the way
through the hostile crowd.

650
00:47:14,244 --> 00:47:16,410
You can feel the energy.
I'm sure Creed does.

651
00:47:16,412 --> 00:47:19,313
He has a big advantage
with the fans in his corner.

652
00:47:24,854 --> 00:47:28,523
Stay focused. You're
at home, baby. Focus is the key.

653
00:47:28,525 --> 00:47:30,658
Given Drago's size
and style,

654
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,728
he'll look to use his power
to counter Creed's speed.

655
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,295
Remember why
we're here, man.

656
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:48,076
I'm the champ.

657
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,314
I'm the champ.

658
00:47:55,852 --> 00:47:57,350
I'm the champ.

659
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:49,234
Adonis Creed making
a grand entrance tonight.

660
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:52,072
Like his father,
Creed is ever the showman,

661
00:48:52,074 --> 00:48:53,642
and is energizing the crowd.

662
00:48:59,213 --> 00:49:04,249
Creed is letting Drago know
exactly who this arena belongs to.

663
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:06,685
It all feels
so Shakespearean.

664
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:12,426
Two sons, raised a world apart,
yet inexorably linked by tragedy.

665
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:18,631
Now, gentlemen,

666
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:20,666
I went over the rules
in the dressing room.

667
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:24,003
<i>I wanna caution you to keep
this fight clean at all times.</i>

668
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:25,938
<i>Protect yourself at all times.</i>

669
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,140
<i>And what I say, you must obey.</i>

670
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:30,444
Good luck. Touch gloves.

671
00:49:35,716 --> 00:49:37,181
Touch gloves.

672
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,652
Creed fights without
longtime trainer Rocky Balboa.

673
00:49:39,654 --> 00:49:41,920
Interesting to see
how Duke manages the corner

674
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:44,056
with so much bad blood
between the fighters.

675
00:49:44,058 --> 00:49:45,524
Look at him.

676
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:47,225
He think he gonna run
straight through you.

677
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:48,527
- You show him what's up.
- Yeah.

678
00:49:48,529 --> 00:49:51,597
This is your house, all right?

679
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,267
- It's my house.
- Let's go, baby.

680
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,811
Box!

681
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:07,445
And we're underway.

682
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:09,081
If all goes according to form,

683
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,716
Creed is seen as the more
versatile boxer, quicker...

684
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,351
Yeah, baby, throw that jab!
Let it rip!

685
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:15,753
Drago is trying to land
something big.

686
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:17,056
Dig, dig.

687
00:50:17,058 --> 00:50:18,358
Downstairs.

688
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:22,262
Creed connects
with a couple of body shots.

689
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:28,700
And a right hand upstairs
for Creed.

690
00:50:28,702 --> 00:50:31,335
Drago hasn't thrown
a meaningful punch yet.

691
00:50:31,337 --> 00:50:33,339
And another right hand
for Creed.

692
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:39,077
Creed blocked that punch

693
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:41,446
and still it knocked him back
into the ropes.

694
00:50:41,448 --> 00:50:42,680
Yeah, we good.

695
00:50:42,682 --> 00:50:44,716
Creed doesn't
like that, Jim.

696
00:50:44,718 --> 00:50:46,984
Don't be stupid, kid.
He's baiting you.

697
00:50:46,986 --> 00:50:49,856
Creed pressing now, angrily rushes
forward with a volley of punches.

698
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,891
He's pulling you in.

699
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:55,258
A huge left hook
by Drago!

700
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,095
- Come on, kid.
- <i>Creed shaken up by that punch.</i>

701
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,528
Clear your head.

702
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,931
Creed commands
the center of the ring,

703
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:01,531
but there's a hard body shot
to the ribs.

704
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:02,900
And another one
on the other side.

705
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:05,670
What you doing, baby?
What you doing, D?

706
00:51:05,672 --> 00:51:09,841
And a right hand by Drago
that knocks Creed's head back.

707
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:12,210
Creed can feel the power
behind those punches.

708
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:13,945
And now
Drago is on the attack.

709
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,645
Jab out, jab out, jab out.
Hands up, let's go!

710
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:17,884
Drago's stalking him
along the ropes.

711
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,352
Get off the ropes, D!

712
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:23,022
Out the corner!

713
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:26,859
No, D! Out the corner,
out the corner!

714
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,499
Hard right hand by Drago,
and Creed is shaken

715
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:38,001
as the first round
comes to a close.

716
00:51:38,003 --> 00:51:40,704
I think most watching at home
are a little surprised

717
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:43,273
by how impressive
Viktor Drago has looked

718
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:47,077
in these opening minutes
of the fight.

719
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:49,646
<i>With the history these men share,</i>

720
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,615
<i>Duke may have his hands full
keeping Creed</i>

721
00:51:51,617 --> 00:51:54,151
<i>from letting his emotions
get the best of him.</i>

722
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,919
What you doing, D?

723
00:51:55,921 --> 00:51:58,088
- You need to stick with the game plan.
- I know, I know.

724
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,123
Stay off the line. Take your angles.
You ain't taking your angles.

725
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,290
I know!

726
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:02,592
If he throws you
a left hook...

727
00:52:02,594 --> 00:52:04,261
Come on, man,
hold the phone on that.

728
00:52:04,263 --> 00:52:05,962
- You think I don't know that shit?
- Well, if you know it,

729
00:52:05,964 --> 00:52:07,065
do it!

730
00:52:09,867 --> 00:52:10,992
He's afraid.

731
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:12,701
I know.

732
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:14,409
Then tell me...

733
00:52:14,826 --> 00:52:17,658
Why is he still standing?

734
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:21,784
Break him.

735
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:27,416
And now, as we prepare for round
two, this crowd is still buzzing

736
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:32,055
from the vicious rally that Drago
brought forth in the last minute

737
00:52:32,057 --> 00:52:33,956
of round number one.

738
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,658
Come out smart.

739
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,260
Got Creed in serious trouble
as the round came to a close.

740
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:38,527
Box!

741
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:40,029
And now,
round two begins.

742
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:44,035
And Drago comes out throwing,
wasting no time.

743
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:50,906
- Get off the ropes!
- And Creed is backed

744
00:52:50,908 --> 00:52:53,444
into the ropes, trying to
avoid those power shots.

745
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,012
Damn.

746
00:52:57,014 --> 00:52:58,983
Things just got
ugly fast.

747
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:05,957
And another hard right hand shot,
and Creed is in big trouble now.

748
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:08,491
Keep moving, Donnie.

749
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:15,798
A massive right hand
sends Creed reeling.

750
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,765
He tries to regain
his footing.

751
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:19,567
Creed trying to answer back.

752
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:23,707
And now a huge hook sends
Creed flying through the ropes!

753
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,876
Come on, kid.

754
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:33,282
Two!

755
00:53:33,284 --> 00:53:34,382
Three!

756
00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:35,550
Four!

757
00:53:35,552 --> 00:53:37,619
Five! Six!

758
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:38,887
That's it,
that's it, that's it.

759
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,189
Creed! Creed!

760
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:42,025
- You okay?
- Yeah.

761
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:45,693
Box!

762
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:46,961
Creed needs something

763
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:48,364
to try to turn
this fight around.

764
00:53:48,452 --> 00:53:49,452
Take him out!

765
00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:52,000
Drago just keeps coming.

766
00:53:52,002 --> 00:53:54,435
What a big rib shot!

767
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:56,137
Shit.

768
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:57,872
Those were two tremendous
right hands to the rib cage.

769
00:53:57,874 --> 00:54:00,409
You could've heard that one
in the nosebleed seats.

770
00:54:08,184 --> 00:54:10,785
Creed clearly in pain,
as he finds a way to his feet.

771
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:12,654
Not ready to give up yet.

772
00:54:12,656 --> 00:54:14,724
I don't know. This
is getting dangerous, Jim.

773
00:54:17,794 --> 00:54:19,894
Okay! Come to me!

774
00:54:19,896 --> 00:54:22,063
And now, Bayless is
gonna let him go again.

775
00:54:22,065 --> 00:54:23,066
Ready?

776
00:54:23,532 --> 00:54:25,066
Box!

777
00:54:25,068 --> 00:54:27,534
He comes barreling
out of the corner.

778
00:54:27,536 --> 00:54:29,237
Huge right hook!

779
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:30,904
Drago trying to end it.

780
00:54:32,242 --> 00:54:34,474
And Creed delivers
a big right hand at the bell.

781
00:54:34,476 --> 00:54:36,177
Get back!
Get back to your corner!

782
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:38,212
Bayless restraining
Drago, seemingly frustrated...

783
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:39,613
Obey my commands.

784
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,150
...as he was close
to finishing the fight.

785
00:54:42,152 --> 00:54:45,154
You got to show me something.
If not, I'm gonna stop it.

786
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:49,489
Can you fight?

787
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:51,458
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

788
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,794
Hell no.
I'm calling this fight.

789
00:54:53,796 --> 00:54:55,162
Nigga, don't call this shit.

790
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:56,930
You ain't got to prove shit
to nobody.

791
00:54:56,932 --> 00:55:00,067
Look at you. Your ribs
look like they broke.

792
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:02,905
You can't
call this fight.

793
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,370
He's embarrassing you.

794
00:55:07,453 --> 00:55:10,537
That's why they look down on us.

795
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,953
That's why she left us.

796
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:18,454
That's why!

797
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:25,158
Hand me
my mouthpiece.

798
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,932
My mouthpiece.

799
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:41,576
Don't do it.

800
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:44,277
Now, as we go
to round three,

801
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:47,280
Adonis Creed has been
beaten up and bloodied

802
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:49,615
by an avalanche of power shots

803
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:51,917
from Viktor Drago
in the first two rounds.

804
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:54,754
And we'll see how much
Adonis Creed has left now,

805
00:55:54,756 --> 00:55:56,323
as he tries to stay alive
in the fight.

806
00:55:56,325 --> 00:55:57,890
Stop the fight.

807
00:55:57,892 --> 00:55:59,692
Dangerous swings
from Drago

808
00:55:59,694 --> 00:56:02,294
as Creed desperately tries
to hold him off.

809
00:56:02,296 --> 00:56:04,899
Drago's still putting
huge pressure on the body.

810
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,800
Come on, stop the fight!

811
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:09,935
And another shot
by Drago!

812
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:11,771
Creed seemingly
on his last legs!

813
00:56:11,773 --> 00:56:13,674
- Drago on the attack.
- Come on, D!

814
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,711
Oh, and with a devastating
shot to the rib cage.

815
00:56:18,713 --> 00:56:20,014
Stop! Stop!

816
00:56:55,283 --> 00:56:59,017
This is an obvious
disqualification, or so it would appear

817
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,985
because Creed was fully down

818
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:03,088
at the moment that Drago
landed that last shot.

819
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,856
- No!
- You wanna kill somebody?

820
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:07,158
- No way, baby. No!
- Easy, easy!

821
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,927
- No. No, no, no!
- Come on.

822
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:10,931
No! Just relax.

823
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,514
<i>This arena is
completely silent</i>

824
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:31,916
<i>as the audience waits to see</i>

825
00:57:31,918 --> 00:57:35,855
<i>what will be the condition
of young Adonis Creed.</i>

826
00:57:56,909 --> 00:58:01,579
Cracked orbital bone, two
cracked ribs, grade-3 concussion,

827
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:04,349
ruptured kidney,
numerous contusions.

828
00:58:04,351 --> 00:58:05,651
Oh...

829
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,951
A ruptured kidney, is that...

830
00:58:07,953 --> 00:58:09,653
His injuries will heal
with rest and time,

831
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:11,421
including the kidney.

832
00:58:11,423 --> 00:58:13,625
Now, we shouldn't have
to resort to surgery,

833
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,993
but we will need to keep him here for
at least 48 hours, as a precaution.

834
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:20,664
Now he's still numb from the morphine,
but he'll certainly feel it later.

835
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,866
- Okay.
- You okay?

836
00:58:22,868 --> 00:58:25,271
Fine, I just gotta sit.

837
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:29,339
If you're expecting...

838
00:58:29,341 --> 00:58:30,706
No, I'm fine.

839
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:33,811
No, no, seriously.
Take it easy, okay?

840
00:58:35,514 --> 00:58:37,114
Excuse me, Dr. Ewell.

841
00:58:37,116 --> 00:58:40,386
You have a visitor.
Right this way.

842
00:58:48,427 --> 00:58:49,792
Bianca.

843
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:51,694
Listen, I'm so sorry
everything went...

844
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:53,698
I should've been there.

845
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,967
I'm so sorry.

846
00:58:57,035 --> 00:58:58,569
I am.

847
00:58:58,571 --> 00:58:59,735
Me, too.

848
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,739
Is it okay if I see him?

849
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:06,510
What difference do it
make to us? We saw what happened.

850
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:08,313
They doing what they supposed
to be doing.

851
00:59:09,314 --> 00:59:10,848
I don't care.

852
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,550
Right. Okay.

853
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:14,819
Got it.

854
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:27,230
WBC's not gonna contest
the referee's decision,

855
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:31,236
so Viktor
remains disqualified.

856
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:33,938
Bottom line,

857
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:36,672
you still the champ.

858
00:59:38,076 --> 00:59:40,009
I'm gonna let you rest, man.

859
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:43,546
So, if you need something,
you know, I'm outside.

860
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:53,056
Got some company, D.

861
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,241
You did good.

862
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:14,778
We tried.

863
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:29,457
You know, I watched you
back in Philadelphia.

864
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,994
You showed a ton of heart.
I mean, there's no doubt about it.

865
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,132
- Showed a ton of heart.
- Heart?

866
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:39,467
Man, I ain't trying
to hear that shit.

867
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,903
D. It's Rock.

868
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:43,138
Oh, it's okay.
It's all right.

869
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,473
No, you guys gotta
work it out.

870
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,512
I lost the fight
before it even started, right?

871
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,580
No. No, no.

872
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,417
This guy was...
He's a big guy, he's strong.

873
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:57,285
He got the reach on you.
He got all kinds of...

874
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,189
Oh, now you're trying
to train me?

875
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,826
Be my coach?

876
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:08,164
No, look at me.

877
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,867
Look at me.

878
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,475
What are you still doing here?

879
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,811
Here to pick up the pieces?

880
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:24,713
No.

881
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,717
Shouldn't you be in Philly?

882
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,419
- Adonis.
- No, it's okay.

883
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,190
I don't want him to get all...

884
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:38,260
Take care of each other.

885
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:41,997
I'm sorry.

886
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,879
Baby.

887
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,419
He loves you, D.

888
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,290
Look at me.

889
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,393
I'm looking
right at you, babe.

890
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,498
How's that baby
gonna look at me?

891
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:12,385
Adonis, do you really
feel like a champ?

892
01:03:12,387 --> 01:03:14,554
Do you think you deserve
to keep the belt?

893
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:16,188
Why would you take
that fight, Adonis?

894
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,125
Is this it
for Adonis Creed?

895
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:31,838
I'm cool. I'm cool.

896
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,008
- D, please, let me help you, baby.
- I said I can walk.

897
01:03:38,212 --> 01:03:40,314
- Please sit...
- I said I got it.

898
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:32,633
I don't know.
Lately, it's like...

899
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:36,902
He hasn't really been himself.

900
01:04:36,904 --> 01:04:40,005
And I get it.

901
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:43,374
'Cause he's going
through a lot.

902
01:04:43,376 --> 01:04:46,544
<i>He's just starting
physical therapy.</i>

903
01:04:46,546 --> 01:04:48,681
<i>Trying to get himself right.</i>

904
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:50,750
<i>And</i>

905
01:04:52,051 --> 01:04:53,519
<i>he's, uh...</i>

906
01:04:54,487 --> 01:04:55,588
<i>distant</i>

907
01:04:56,923 --> 01:04:59,792
<i>and disconnected.</i>

908
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,063
It's like nothing really
matters to him right now.

909
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:06,332
Including me.

910
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,668
Which is new.

911
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:14,038
<i>Yeah.</i>

912
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,411
<i>Listen, be there
for him, take care of him,</i>

913
01:05:19,312 --> 01:05:21,645
<i>give him your love.</i>

914
01:05:21,647 --> 01:05:24,548
<i>But also, you gotta realize
he's in a place right now</i>

915
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,617
<i>that only he can
get himself out of.</i>

916
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:28,318
And with everything
he's going through...

917
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,787
With everything
he's going through?

918
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:32,324
You've been in his corner
every step of the way.

919
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,696
<i>He's a grown man.</i>

920
01:05:40,231 --> 01:05:43,000
<i>He's gotta heal
from the inside out.</i>

921
01:05:43,002 --> 01:05:45,871
Trust me, I know.
I've been there.

922
01:05:46,671 --> 01:05:47,773
Mmm.

923
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,450
Feel her?

924
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:36,953
Yeah.

925
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,454
<i>Highlights of Drago
silencing critics tonight</i>

926
01:06:39,456 --> 01:06:42,524
<i>with a devastating first round
knockout of Anthony Novak.</i>

927
01:06:42,526 --> 01:06:44,994
<i>Here's a post-fight interview
with Max Kellerman.</i>

928
01:06:44,996 --> 01:06:46,763
<i>Viktor, here we are
just months</i>

929
01:06:46,765 --> 01:06:48,998
<i>since your controversial loss
to Adonis Creed.</i>

930
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,833
<i>How does this win feel?</i>

931
01:06:50,835 --> 01:06:52,401
<i>What loss?</i>

932
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:53,970
<i>Excuse me.</i>

933
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:56,371
<i>From your disqualification
to Adonis Creed.</i>

934
01:06:56,373 --> 01:06:58,908
<i>But how does this
feel to you tonight?</i>

935
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,877
<i>I don't care.
Creed must fight me.</i>

936
01:07:01,879 --> 01:07:04,013
<i>And if he
doesn't fight you?</i>

937
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:05,947
<i>Then he's no champion.</i>

938
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:09,184
<i>There you have it, Adonis.
Challenge is on the table.</i>

939
01:07:18,999 --> 01:07:20,249
We are very proud of you.

940
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,625
To you, Viktor.

941
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,333
May your success bring
glory back to Russian boxing.

942
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:34,581
Please accept this gift.

943
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,706
Now all you need to do...

944
01:07:58,914 --> 01:08:02,332
...is bring the belt home this time, right?

945
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,375
Hello, Viktor.

946
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,789
You must be proud.

947
01:09:06,169 --> 01:09:07,602
Viktor!

948
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,414
All of these people are here for us!

949
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,957
For you!
- These people?

950
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:18,250
They're the ones who ran you out!

951
01:09:19,332 --> 01:09:21,083
Why are we here?

952
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,291
To build a future.

953
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,750
I don't even know that woman.

954
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,125
She may as well be a stranger.

955
01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:28,208
She left you!

956
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,208
They all did!

957
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,833
Abandoned you!

958
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Shamed you!

959
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,834
I lost!

960
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,541
I lost...

961
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,376
But you won't.

962
01:10:07,028 --> 01:10:08,594
What's good?

963
01:10:08,596 --> 01:10:10,696
Just maintaining, man.
Long time no see, what's up?

964
01:10:10,698 --> 01:10:16,401
Nothing, man. Just been caught up.
You know, the house, the baby.

965
01:10:16,403 --> 01:10:17,536
You know how it is.

966
01:10:17,538 --> 01:10:19,638
Yeah? How Bianca doing?

967
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,541
She's good. She's good.

968
01:10:22,543 --> 01:10:25,644
Good, good, good.

969
01:10:25,646 --> 01:10:29,081
Listen, man, I've been meaning
to hit you up, though.

970
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:32,117
Commissioner wanna know
who we plan to fight next.

971
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:34,186
You ain't gotta fight Drago,

972
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,755
but you gotta fight someone.

973
01:10:36,757 --> 01:10:39,524
You gotta defend the belt.

974
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:41,729
Otherwise,
it's gonna be vacated.

975
01:10:43,998 --> 01:10:47,534
I could set up a little, you
know, tune-up fight, kind of.

976
01:10:54,275 --> 01:10:55,640
No. You know what, man?

977
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:56,708
Don't worry about
none of that right now.

978
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,311
Listen, just come on inside.

979
01:10:59,313 --> 01:11:01,481
Hit the bag, man, warm up.

980
01:11:02,316 --> 01:11:04,249
Yeah.

981
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:06,987
Yeah, I'm gonna grab my stuff,
and I'm gonna meet you in there.

982
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:11,191
All right, man.

983
01:11:21,135 --> 01:11:23,268
Put your body weight
into that glove.

984
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,139
There you go. Lean in it.

985
01:11:36,716 --> 01:11:39,552
Yeah, I called you,
like, a thousand times.

986
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,588
Yeah, it's about the light.

987
01:11:43,556 --> 01:11:44,889
How long?

988
01:11:44,891 --> 01:11:47,391
You want to be specific?
Couple years.

989
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:49,126
Yeah.

990
01:11:49,128 --> 01:11:51,631
I mean, how many guys does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

991
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:54,968
I'm not joking.

992
01:11:56,601 --> 01:11:58,836
Can I call you guys back?

993
01:11:58,838 --> 01:12:00,006
Yeah.

994
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:16,521
Wow.

995
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:40,879
Hey, Ma.

996
01:12:42,881 --> 01:12:44,016
Ma.

997
01:12:57,561 --> 01:12:58,797
Hey, Ma.

998
01:13:02,533 --> 01:13:03,969
How you doing, kid?

999
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:07,237
What are you doing here?

1000
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:09,105
I hope you don't mind,

1001
01:13:09,107 --> 01:13:12,244
your mom asked if I would come out
'cause she's worried about you.

1002
01:13:15,213 --> 01:13:16,914
I am, too.

1003
01:13:17,349 --> 01:13:18,849
I'm good.

1004
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:23,019
You didn't have to come
all this way.

1005
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:24,820
By train.

1006
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:28,391
Three days
on a train.

1007
01:13:28,393 --> 01:13:30,759
It's all right, you know,
gives you time to think.

1008
01:13:30,761 --> 01:13:35,564
And you watch all these places
whipping by the windows like postcards.

1009
01:13:35,566 --> 01:13:37,534
It's quite an experience.

1010
01:13:37,536 --> 01:13:39,802
Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

1011
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:41,672
Yeah, it was nice.

1012
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,239
This is wonderful.

1013
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:47,812
How you have
all this out here.

1014
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:51,481
You could have the same.

1015
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:53,215
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

1016
01:13:53,217 --> 01:13:56,718
I mean,
not just the shiny stuff,

1017
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,289
but the better stuff.

1018
01:14:00,424 --> 01:14:01,859
Have a better life.

1019
01:14:05,463 --> 01:14:07,231
Be a better man.

1020
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:12,800
You know, I was thinking about
what you were saying about

1021
01:14:12,802 --> 01:14:16,673
what smart decisions
have I made lately.

1022
01:14:19,944 --> 01:14:22,113
Couldn't think of many.

1023
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,984
You know, I wasn't even there
when my son's son,

1024
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:31,255
my grandson,

1025
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:34,055
was born.

1026
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:38,393
I mean, he's like
that tall now probably.

1027
01:14:38,395 --> 01:14:41,332
I don't even know him.
He doesn't know me.

1028
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:46,336
It's pathetic.

1029
01:14:47,605 --> 01:14:49,372
Well, why won't you just

1030
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,040
call him?

1031
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:55,411
It ain't that easy,
you know...

1032
01:14:58,014 --> 01:14:59,313
Listen,

1033
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:03,417
I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

1034
01:15:03,419 --> 01:15:05,188
You know what I mean?

1035
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:10,026
So, you gotta ask yourself,

1036
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:13,594
what's the valuable stuff?

1037
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:16,631
It's like I asked you before.

1038
01:15:16,633 --> 01:15:19,302
What were you
really fighting for?

1039
01:15:21,504 --> 01:15:23,006
I was afraid.

1040
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:27,809
Of this.

1041
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:32,781
Expectations.

1042
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,185
Being the champ.

1043
01:15:37,387 --> 01:15:40,789
I was scared I couldn't do
what he couldn't.

1044
01:15:43,158 --> 01:15:44,427
It's weird.

1045
01:15:46,762 --> 01:15:49,131
I used to feel like
he was apart of me.

1046
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,333
Now I can't hear him,
or that thing,

1047
01:15:53,335 --> 01:15:56,369
that thing that tells me
to get in the ring.

1048
01:15:56,371 --> 01:15:58,905
Move my feet,
keep my hands up.

1049
01:15:58,907 --> 01:16:01,243
Hit anything
that gets in my way.

1050
01:16:05,615 --> 01:16:07,449
I can't hear it anymore.

1051
01:16:15,257 --> 01:16:17,657
I don't even know how I lost.

1052
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:19,827
Your mind wasn't right.

1053
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:26,168
And your natural style just
won't work with a guy that big.

1054
01:16:34,576 --> 01:16:36,445
You saying yours was better?

1055
01:16:37,446 --> 01:16:39,181
I won, didn't I?

1056
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:49,255
- Good seeing you, Unc.
- Great to see you, too.

1057
01:16:49,257 --> 01:16:51,090
I was talking
with your mother,

1058
01:16:51,092 --> 01:16:56,563
and she says you came up
with this name for the child.

1059
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:57,830
- Amara.
- Amara.

1060
01:16:57,832 --> 01:16:59,064
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1061
01:16:59,066 --> 01:17:00,734
Why, what's wrong with that?

1062
01:17:00,736 --> 01:17:03,235
No, it's a beautiful name,
but it's kind of complicated.

1063
01:17:03,237 --> 01:17:04,937
Why don't you think
about something,

1064
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:07,139
at least I would,
a little simpler to say,

1065
01:17:07,141 --> 01:17:10,609
like "Becky" or "Cate,"
something like that.

1066
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:12,011
Cate Creed?

1067
01:17:12,013 --> 01:17:13,846
Cate Creed. Two "C's."
Easy to remember.

1068
01:17:13,848 --> 01:17:15,848
You do know
she's gonna be black, right?

1069
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:17,850
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1070
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,521
Okay.

1071
01:17:21,455 --> 01:17:23,324
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah.

1072
01:17:25,026 --> 01:17:26,560
Wait, right now?

1073
01:17:28,296 --> 01:17:30,129
- Relax.
- Okay.

1074
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:32,564
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Mmm-hmm.

1075
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:35,601
You just gotta be there
for her, okay? That's your job.

1076
01:17:35,603 --> 01:17:36,735
I got you, I got you.

1077
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:38,404
- And remember...
- Yeah.

1078
01:17:38,406 --> 01:17:41,839
Today is gonna be the best day
of your life. Right here.

1079
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:43,977
- All right?
- Yeah.

1080
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,812
Best day of your life.

1081
01:17:47,814 --> 01:17:51,051
- I'm having a baby.
- I feel like I'm having a baby.

1082
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,454
- Boy!
- Hey.

1083
01:17:55,456 --> 01:17:57,055
- What you doing?
- I know...

1084
01:17:57,057 --> 01:17:59,458
No, never mind.
Just get in here.

1085
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,659
Okay. Okay, okay.

1086
01:18:00,661 --> 01:18:03,129
Like I said,
I'll be here if you need me.

1087
01:18:04,164 --> 01:18:06,567
- All right.
- All right.

1088
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:13,404
You know,
I'm gonna do what I can.

1089
01:18:13,406 --> 01:18:16,742
You being here
is more than enough.

1090
01:18:16,744 --> 01:18:18,178
Thank you.

1091
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:10,026
Mr. Balboa?

1092
01:19:10,028 --> 01:19:12,830
- Mmm.
- She's here.

1093
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:14,600
Oh, that's great.

1094
01:19:17,269 --> 01:19:21,004
That's absolutely good.

1095
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,674
That's fantastic.

1096
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:31,415
Yo!

1097
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:34,351
Hey, Unc, say hi
to your goddaughter.

1098
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:36,954
Wow. That's quite an honor.

1099
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,857
- Let me see you.
- Here she is.

1100
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:44,061
Hey, hello, beautiful.

1101
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:46,496
So, nurse...

1102
01:19:46,498 --> 01:19:47,499
Hmm?

1103
01:19:50,235 --> 01:19:51,570
...what about the test?

1104
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:54,838
Relax for now.

1105
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:58,710
We'll run an auditory exam as soon
as you and Amara get some rest.

1106
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,747
It's okay, babe.

1107
01:20:03,749 --> 01:20:06,248
Thank God she looks like you.

1108
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,719
Yeah, right.

1109
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,458
So, is she gonna
feel anything?

1110
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:18,862
No, it's painless. I promise.

1111
01:20:18,864 --> 01:20:20,697
Okay. Now that
they're in place,

1112
01:20:20,699 --> 01:20:23,666
what we're gonna do is give
her a series of click stimuli

1113
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:25,100
around 35 decibels

1114
01:20:25,102 --> 01:20:27,470
and check her
neural responses.

1115
01:20:27,472 --> 01:20:29,038
Is that loud?

1116
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,708
Normal auditory range.

1117
01:20:32,877 --> 01:20:34,145
Okay.

1118
01:20:34,745 --> 01:20:36,047
Here we go.

1119
01:20:38,049 --> 01:20:40,282
So what exactly
are we looking for?

1120
01:20:40,284 --> 01:20:42,184
A reading. Spikes.

1121
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:17,920
So, we're not seeing
any waves or spikes, uh,

1122
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:20,689
and given your family history,
there is some cause for concern.

1123
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:23,193
However, it is very early...

1124
01:21:49,819 --> 01:21:51,920
<i>They're gonna run
some more tests.</i>

1125
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:56,426
They said it's early, and, uh,
sometimes they get false reads.

1126
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:02,799
Let me ask you something.

1127
01:22:05,035 --> 01:22:07,202
What if it ain't okay?

1128
01:22:08,337 --> 01:22:09,706
I can't think like that.

1129
01:22:11,373 --> 01:22:13,342
You gotta, I mean,

1130
01:22:14,778 --> 01:22:16,512
how you gonna handle it?

1131
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:18,547
Hmm?

1132
01:22:23,053 --> 01:22:24,520
I don't wanna go there.

1133
01:22:25,254 --> 01:22:27,521
You gonna love her?

1134
01:22:27,523 --> 01:22:30,223
How you gonna ask me
a question like that, Rock?

1135
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:32,426
- Yeah, I'm gonna love her.
- Good.

1136
01:22:32,428 --> 01:22:35,464
'Cause she ain't feeling
sorry for herself,

1137
01:22:36,298 --> 01:22:37,833
and you shouldn't either.

1138
01:22:47,443 --> 01:22:50,212
You got a little...

1139
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:54,216
Oh, it's boxing gloves.

1140
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:56,852
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1141
01:23:05,628 --> 01:23:08,862
<i>Goodnight Moon.</i>
I love that book.

1142
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:10,633
Who's that from, babe?

1143
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:15,602
<i>The unanimous number
one contender Viktor Drago</i>

1144
01:23:15,604 --> 01:23:17,838
<i>has been met with open arms
back in Russia,</i>

1145
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,073
<i>his father's home,
which is nice.</i>

1146
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:23,342
<i>But the question on everyone's
mind is, "Where is Creed?"</i>

1147
01:23:23,344 --> 01:23:27,179
<i>If he doesn't choose an opponent
soon, he risks forfeiting the title</i>

1148
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:30,819
<i>and personally, I can't imagine
him being able to live with that.</i>

1149
01:23:33,254 --> 01:23:35,388
You good?

1150
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,359
Yeah.
Finally got her to settle.

1151
01:23:39,661 --> 01:23:42,895
Hey, I need to
get out of the house.

1152
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:45,431
I was gonna
go over to the studio.

1153
01:23:45,433 --> 01:23:47,702
You mind watching her
until I get back?

1154
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:50,405
Yeah, of course.

1155
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:52,238
Cool.

1156
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,543
Okay, okay.

1157
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,311
Yeah.

1158
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:07,453
You okay?

1159
01:24:07,455 --> 01:24:09,757
Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

1160
01:24:10,858 --> 01:24:12,325
Okay.

1161
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:14,629
Bye.

1162
01:24:27,207 --> 01:24:28,542
Hey.

1163
01:24:32,646 --> 01:24:33,813
Baby.

1164
01:24:33,815 --> 01:24:35,981
Baby, please.

1165
01:24:35,983 --> 01:24:39,217
Hey, you hungry, right?
Hey, baby, you hungry?

1166
01:24:47,828 --> 01:24:50,029
<i>It's Mary Anne.
Please leave a message.</i>

1167
01:24:50,031 --> 01:24:52,098
Hey, Ma. Listen, listen.

1168
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,134
She won't stop crying.
Can you just tell me how to...

1169
01:24:55,136 --> 01:24:56,801
Can you tell me how to
make her stop crying?

1170
01:24:56,803 --> 01:24:59,306
Call me back when you
get this message, okay?

1171
01:25:30,302 --> 01:25:33,707
Hey, what's up, baby girl?

1172
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,373
Hey, no.

1173
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:37,976
It's okay, baby. No, no.

1174
01:25:37,978 --> 01:25:40,613
No, don't cry.
No, not again, please.

1175
01:25:41,148 --> 01:25:42,279
Please.

1176
01:25:42,281 --> 01:25:44,283
No, look, look, look.

1177
01:25:45,484 --> 01:25:47,218
You see that?

1178
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,521
Look, look, look.

1179
01:25:49,822 --> 01:25:50,856
Look.

1180
01:26:05,771 --> 01:26:07,439
I'm right here.

1181
01:26:57,089 --> 01:26:58,389
I'm sorry.

1182
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:01,392
I'm sorry.

1183
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,428
I'm sorry.

1184
01:27:05,697 --> 01:27:08,466
Hey.
No, no, there you go.

1185
01:27:09,301 --> 01:27:10,900
Hey.

1186
01:27:10,902 --> 01:27:12,003
I know.

1187
01:27:13,905 --> 01:27:16,774
Mmm-hmm. Daddy's
being a bitch, I know.

1188
01:27:37,494 --> 01:27:38,830
Hi.

1189
01:27:40,265 --> 01:27:41,900
How'd you do?

1190
01:27:47,105 --> 01:27:48,639
She's a fighter.

1191
01:27:52,076 --> 01:27:53,844
Just like her dad.

1192
01:27:57,282 --> 01:27:59,117
Just like her mom, too.

1193
01:28:08,859 --> 01:28:10,861
I have to fight him again.

1194
01:28:12,263 --> 01:28:15,230
I don't wanna be that person
to stop you.

1195
01:28:15,232 --> 01:28:18,435
But I don't wanna end up
like your mom, alone.

1196
01:28:19,536 --> 01:28:20,869
I feel you.

1197
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:21,872
Do you?

1198
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:27,275
And it's not
just us anymore, D.

1199
01:28:27,277 --> 01:28:31,114
I know it sounds crazy
doing all this all over again.

1200
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:35,984
But this won't be
the end of me.

1201
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:37,786
Or you.

1202
01:28:37,788 --> 01:28:39,520
It can't be, 'cause we a team.

1203
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:42,192
We weren't a team when you
took the fight the last time.

1204
01:28:45,996 --> 01:28:47,164
You right.

1205
01:28:48,165 --> 01:28:49,565
I'm sorry.

1206
01:28:52,768 --> 01:28:54,635
I shouldn't have
put you through that.

1207
01:28:54,637 --> 01:28:56,139
Then why?

1208
01:28:57,007 --> 01:28:58,574
Why do it again?

1209
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:01,842
What do you have to prove?

1210
01:29:01,844 --> 01:29:04,446
It's not about that.

1211
01:29:04,448 --> 01:29:08,050
You wouldn't be any good to anybody
if you didn't do what you love.

1212
01:29:09,785 --> 01:29:12,987
You wouldn't be
able to breathe, right?

1213
01:29:12,989 --> 01:29:17,093
Well, I wouldn't be any good to anybody
if I don't handle this the right way.

1214
01:29:21,597 --> 01:29:23,199
But I need you.

1215
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:26,569
Both of you.

1216
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:37,046
I'll beat him.

1217
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:45,620
You better.

1218
01:29:48,723 --> 01:29:51,260
You gotta think
about this real hard.

1219
01:29:52,727 --> 01:29:55,528
You got people
that need you now.

1220
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:57,965
That's exactly
why I can't lose.

1221
01:29:57,967 --> 01:30:00,833
Buddy said the fight
has to be in Russia.

1222
01:30:00,835 --> 01:30:02,071
Take it or leave it.

1223
01:30:07,343 --> 01:30:08,641
Russia?

1224
01:30:08,643 --> 01:30:10,045
On their turf.

1225
01:30:10,645 --> 01:30:12,013
So Russia it is.

1226
01:30:19,187 --> 01:30:21,788
What you think, Rock?

1227
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:26,059
It's a clear advantage if it
comes down to a judge's decision.

1228
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:30,165
Well, then we can't let it get
to a judge's decision, right?

1229
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:35,336
Oh, shit.

1230
01:30:37,405 --> 01:30:38,673
Call the promoter.

1231
01:30:43,945 --> 01:30:45,980
So we train here tomorrow,
5:00 a.m.

1232
01:30:47,282 --> 01:30:49,248
No, I got other plans.

1233
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:52,018
- You mean, you wanna go to Philly?
- No.

1234
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:55,088
Listen, you wanna
change things in a big way,

1235
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:57,325
then you need to make
some big changes.

1236
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,982
You gotta be
messing with me, right?

1237
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,886
Heard this is a place
where fighters go,

1238
01:31:59,752 --> 01:32:01,785
you know, to start over.

1239
01:32:01,787 --> 01:32:03,257
Get reborn.

1240
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:09,361
What took y'all so long?

1241
01:32:09,363 --> 01:32:10,794
This some wild shit.

1242
01:32:10,796 --> 01:32:13,664
Yeah, sure looks like
hell to me.

1243
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:17,271
Since you're going back to hell,
you might as well get used to it.

1244
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,375
Let's go.

1245
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:35,855
Go for it.

1246
01:32:40,793 --> 01:32:41,994
Harder.

1247
01:32:43,529 --> 01:32:45,162
Harder.

1248
01:32:45,164 --> 01:32:46,165
Harder!

1249
01:32:48,601 --> 01:32:49,869
Keep going.

1250
01:33:05,184 --> 01:33:06,219
Build that neck.

1251
01:33:29,342 --> 01:33:30,476
Okay, man up.

1252
01:33:31,477 --> 01:33:32,777
No.

1253
01:33:33,546 --> 01:33:34,813
I'm good.

1254
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:41,753
That's the fight it's gonna be.
Toe-to-toe. Get used to it.

1255
01:33:43,355 --> 01:33:44,988
Box!

1256
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:46,391
Take it to the body.

1257
01:33:59,471 --> 01:34:00,972
Take it! Fight the pain.

1258
01:34:02,674 --> 01:34:03,975
You all right?

1259
01:34:28,466 --> 01:34:30,266
Get back in there.

1260
01:34:30,268 --> 01:34:32,269
Get back in there. Protect yourself.

1261
01:35:32,596 --> 01:35:34,331
Come on, get up, kid.

1262
01:35:34,864 --> 01:35:36,232
Get up.

1263
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:41,170
Keep moving.

1264
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,074
That's it.

1265
01:37:50,465 --> 01:37:52,331
<i>We're just minutes away
from the fight</i>

1266
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,233
<i>the whole world has been
waiting to see.</i>

1267
01:37:54,235 --> 01:37:57,570
The rematch between
Adonis Creed and Viktor Drago

1268
01:37:57,572 --> 01:37:59,806
for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

1269
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,641
<i>The unique thing
about this fight, Jim,</i>

1270
01:38:01,643 --> 01:38:07,346
<i>is Adonis Creed comes in
a 25-to-1 underdog,</i>

1271
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:09,281
<i>and he's the champ!</i>

1272
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:11,116
<i>Well, it's gonna be
fascinating to see</i>

1273
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,720
<i>what that does to Creed's
mindset as he enters the ring.</i>

1274
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:17,456
<i>Not to mention Drago's.</i>

1275
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:24,431
Drago! Drago! Drago!

1276
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:27,553
Listen...

1277
01:39:11,711 --> 01:39:13,411
And there he is.

1278
01:39:13,413 --> 01:39:17,415
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Drago!
Making his way into the arena.

1279
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:21,252
He does not have the belt,
but to everyone here in Russia

1280
01:39:21,254 --> 01:39:23,055
and to many around the world,

1281
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,458
he is the true
heavyweight champion.

1282
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:04,463
It's time, kid.

1283
01:40:12,739 --> 01:40:15,238
There was no way Creed
could have run from this fight.

1284
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,943
There was such high demand for Adonis
to step back in the ring with Viktor.

1285
01:40:18,945 --> 01:40:23,749
And I'm sure Ivan feels good to
be back home after all these years.

1298

1305
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:03,244
Remember why
you're climbing these steps.

1306
01:42:08,018 --> 01:42:09,653
Come on up, champ.

1307
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:17,059
This is it, Jim.
Creed versus Drago part two.

1308
01:42:17,061 --> 01:42:18,626
Creed looks good tonight,

1309
01:42:18,628 --> 01:42:21,163
but it's impossible to forget
what happened to him

1310
01:42:21,165 --> 01:42:24,099
the last time he stepped
into the ring with Drago.

1311
01:42:24,101 --> 01:42:28,170
Numerous injuries, not least
of all, a nasty broken rib

1312
01:42:28,172 --> 01:42:29,837
and a ruptured kidney.

1313
01:42:29,839 --> 01:42:31,806
A huge difference
in this fight

1314
01:42:31,808 --> 01:42:35,710
is he's got former champ Rocky
Balboa back in his corner.

1315
01:42:35,712 --> 01:42:37,645
And Rocky assures everyone

1316
01:42:37,647 --> 01:42:40,583
this fight will be very
different from its predecessor.

1317
01:42:44,255 --> 01:42:48,923
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen. This is it.

1318
01:42:48,925 --> 01:42:51,058
Twelve rounds of boxing

1319
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:56,030
for the heavyweight
championship of the world!

1320
01:42:56,032 --> 01:42:58,099
Ladies and gentlemen,

1321
01:42:58,101 --> 01:43:00,868
let's get ready to rumble!

1322
01:43:04,107 --> 01:43:07,875
You can feel the nervous
energy in the arena tonight, Jim.

1323
01:43:07,877 --> 01:43:10,611
Creed has some courage
to get back into the ring

1324
01:43:10,613 --> 01:43:12,713
with a man who nearly
ended his career.

1325
01:43:12,715 --> 01:43:16,019
A man who is hungry
to be champ.

1326
01:43:22,158 --> 01:43:23,257
Fighters,

1327
01:43:24,626 --> 01:43:26,493
I want good,
clean fight.

1328
01:43:28,764 --> 01:43:31,032
Break when
I tell you to break.

1329
01:43:31,034 --> 01:43:34,135
You go to your corner when I
tell you to go to your corner.

1330
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:41,908
Touch gloves.

1331
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:44,978
Rocky Balboa and Ivan
Drago sharing the ring

1332
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:47,248
for the first time
in 30 years.

1333
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:52,118
If anyone knows how to take on a
slugger like Drago, it would be Rocky.

1334
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,754
You know you got
the fire in your gut,

1335
01:43:54,756 --> 01:43:58,124
and I know you'll do
what needs to be done.

1336
01:43:58,126 --> 01:44:02,631
Because now, you know what
you're fighting for.

1337
01:44:03,389 --> 01:44:06,888
This time we take the belt.

1338
01:44:06,802 --> 01:44:10,436
Viktor overwhelmed
Creed's previous game plan,

1339
01:44:10,438 --> 01:44:12,471
and I think
it got in Adonis' head.

1340
01:44:12,473 --> 01:44:16,276
It's gonna be interesting to see
how Rocky Balboa has prepared Creed

1341
01:44:16,278 --> 01:44:19,545
for what is surely to become
an all-out brawl.

1342
01:44:19,547 --> 01:44:20,949
Ready?

1343
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:23,449
Ready?

1344
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:24,717
Box.

1345
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,552
And we're underway.

1346
01:44:26,554 --> 01:44:30,589
Drago comes out swinging
with two hooks that Creed avoids.

1347
01:44:30,591 --> 01:44:32,725
And a big right-hand
right out of the gate.

1348
01:44:32,727 --> 01:44:34,526
Watch that right, Donnie.

1349
01:44:34,528 --> 01:44:37,932
Drago a bit surprised as
Creed shakes that punch off.

1350
01:44:38,097 --> 01:44:40,805
You got this!

1351
01:44:43,238 --> 01:44:46,741
Drago is pressing hard,
but Creed is not backing off.

1352
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:49,909
Keep moving, keep moving.

1353
01:44:49,911 --> 01:44:52,113
Creed working a little
bit closer to Drago tonight.

1354
01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:58,486
That is a vicious
combination by Creed.

1355
01:45:01,989 --> 01:45:04,490
And now a right hand by Drago.

1356
01:45:04,492 --> 01:45:07,526
Here we go,
Drago applying pressure.

1357
01:45:07,528 --> 01:45:08,896
- Out the corner!
- Come on, Donnie!

1358
01:45:11,065 --> 01:45:13,534
Creed manages
to slip away.

1359
01:45:14,936 --> 01:45:15,937
Let's get it.

1360
01:45:17,772 --> 01:45:19,772
Yeah, what's up?

1361
01:45:19,774 --> 01:45:22,607
Now they're squaring off in
the middle of the ring, toe-to-toe.

1362
01:45:22,609 --> 01:45:24,043
Taking blows.

1363
01:45:24,045 --> 01:45:26,111
Creed staying in his face.

1364
01:45:26,113 --> 01:45:27,880
And there's the bell! As a wild
first round comes to an end.

1365
01:45:27,882 --> 01:45:29,480
Go to your corner.

1366
01:45:29,482 --> 01:45:31,283
Drago frustrated.

1367
01:45:31,285 --> 01:45:32,918
Creed is looking like a
different fighter tonight, Max.

1368
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,552
- That's it, D! That's it!
- Yes!

1369
01:45:34,554 --> 01:45:36,454
Oh, yeah, who's saying
Drago now, though?

1370
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:40,292
See, all that work in
the desert paid off, right?

1371
01:45:40,294 --> 01:45:41,994
Yeah, you got him.
You got him thinking.

1372
01:45:41,996 --> 01:45:44,196
He wasn't expecting
what you're bringing.

1373
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:46,566
Now, he's gonna bring the heat the
next round, but you're ready for it.

1374
01:45:47,266 --> 01:45:48,682
What did I train you for?

1375
01:45:48,849 --> 01:45:50,931
Hit to drop him!

1376
01:45:51,272 --> 01:45:52,971
He overextends his right hand.

1377
01:45:52,973 --> 01:45:54,605
You gonna counter
with the right

1378
01:45:54,607 --> 01:45:56,007
and crack him with the left.
You got that?

1379
01:45:56,009 --> 01:45:58,009
Extend the right,
crack him with the left.

1380
01:45:58,011 --> 01:46:01,079
He'll never expect it. His old
man did the same thing to me.

1381
01:46:01,081 --> 01:46:02,880
One early observation,
Max.

1382
01:46:02,882 --> 01:46:05,783
I think Creed is withstanding
Drago's combinations

1383
01:46:05,785 --> 01:46:07,919
much better tonight
than in the first fight.

1384
01:46:07,921 --> 01:46:09,287
Box.

1385
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:12,090
And round two begins.

1386
01:46:12,092 --> 01:46:14,260
Drago with a huge left hook.

1387
01:46:16,629 --> 01:46:18,563
And a big right hand.

1388
01:46:18,565 --> 01:46:21,399
Drago on the attack again, now
driving Creed back into the ropes.

1389
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:24,037
He's overextending the right!
Watch the right!

1390
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,141
A right
and a left for Creed.

1391
01:46:30,472 --> 01:46:32,097
Bait him with the right!

1392
01:46:40,253 --> 01:46:43,087
Huge uppercut
has Creed holding on now.

1393
01:46:43,089 --> 01:46:45,591
Drago throws him off
into the corner.

1394
01:46:49,429 --> 01:46:51,563
- Get out of that corner!
- Get out of the corner!

1395
01:46:53,665 --> 01:46:56,833
And Drago throws Creed
to the canvas.

1396
01:47:00,005 --> 01:47:01,071
What's going on?

1397
01:47:01,073 --> 01:47:02,706
Shades
of the first fight,

1398
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:04,808
but Drago showing restraint
this time.

1399
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:05,976
You good?

1400
01:47:05,978 --> 01:47:07,079
Yes, I'm good.

1401
01:47:07,266 --> 01:47:08,266
Take him out!

1402
01:47:09,348 --> 01:47:12,649
- Box.
- Drago explodes from the break.

1403
01:47:12,651 --> 01:47:13,917
And Creed is down!

1404
01:47:13,919 --> 01:47:16,019
A flurry of heavy shots!

1405
01:47:16,021 --> 01:47:19,291
Drago's power
is just incredible.

1406
01:47:20,659 --> 01:47:22,094
Three.

1407
01:47:22,461 --> 01:47:23,994
Four.

1408
01:47:23,996 --> 01:47:26,096
Take the eight count.
Take the full eight.

1409
01:47:26,098 --> 01:47:27,630
Creed taking his time
on the canvas.

1410
01:47:27,632 --> 01:47:28,799
Six.

1411
01:47:28,801 --> 01:47:30,801
Stay down! Breathe!

1412
01:47:30,803 --> 01:47:33,236
He's listening to Rocky, who
has been in this situation before.

1413
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:34,871
Eight.

1414
01:47:34,873 --> 01:47:36,373
And Creed is back on his feet.
Beats the count.

1415
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:37,474
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

1416
01:47:37,476 --> 01:47:38,875
Box.

1417
01:47:38,877 --> 01:47:40,510
Tie him up. Don't fight him.
Tie him up.

1418
01:47:40,512 --> 01:47:42,948
Drago is right back at it.

1419
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:48,251
So, with the knockdown and
those hard shots at the end,

1420
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:51,188
that round clearly goes
to Viktor Drago.

1421
01:47:51,190 --> 01:47:53,823
And you could just feel
he's gaining momentum.

1422
01:47:53,825 --> 01:47:55,559
You knew this was
gonna be a war, right?

1423
01:47:55,561 --> 01:47:56,926
You knew that going in there.

1424
01:47:56,928 --> 01:47:59,329
From now on,
it's who wants it more,

1425
01:47:59,331 --> 01:48:00,796
and who's got more heart.

1426
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:03,807
Good job...

1427
01:48:03,801 --> 01:48:06,436
Don't let him crack you. You stay on
the outside, you're gonna get hurt.

1428
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:08,704
You stay on the inside,
you'll tear him up.

1429
01:48:08,706 --> 01:48:10,540
I'm telling you,
it's all about pressure.

1430
01:48:10,542 --> 01:48:13,611
If you wanna give pain, you gotta
be willing to take the pain.

1431
01:48:23,521 --> 01:48:24,989
Come on!

1432
01:48:29,427 --> 01:48:30,695
- Yes!
- Yes!

1433
01:48:31,557 --> 01:48:32,637
This is our belt...

1434
01:48:32,725 --> 01:48:34,808
and you're losing it!

1435
01:48:35,099 --> 01:48:37,833
Round four
is another brutal display

1436
01:48:37,835 --> 01:48:41,137
as Creed takes a lot of
punishment from Drago.

1437
01:48:42,573 --> 01:48:44,873
Drago is not slowing down.

1438
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:47,644
Landing a big shot
after the bell.

1439
01:48:48,812 --> 01:48:50,179
What is your problem?

1440
01:48:50,181 --> 01:48:51,282
Yo!

1441
01:48:53,084 --> 01:48:56,885
The violent chess match
continues, Jim.

1442
01:48:56,887 --> 01:48:59,555
Oh, and Creed is down again.

1443
01:48:59,557 --> 01:49:01,590
Donnie, get up.

1444
01:49:01,592 --> 01:49:04,959
Drago clearly dominating this
fight, but Creed will not give up.

1445
01:49:04,961 --> 01:49:06,529
He is taking
a lot of punishment.

1446
01:49:06,531 --> 01:49:08,129
You gotta stay
in his face. Look at me.

1447
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:10,198
You gotta stay in his face.

1448
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,201
And when you see an
opportunity, you go after it.

1449
01:49:17,407 --> 01:49:18,708
There you are!

1450
01:49:21,878 --> 01:49:23,280
Drago is cut now.

1451
01:49:27,751 --> 01:49:29,384
As we enter round eight,

1452
01:49:29,386 --> 01:49:32,487
we are deeper into this fight
than anyone expected.

1453
01:49:32,489 --> 01:49:35,992
Creed must sense he's behind.
He's trying to force the action.

1454
01:49:38,727 --> 01:49:40,030
Yes, baby!

1455
01:49:48,471 --> 01:49:51,573
What we are seeing
tonight is Adonis Creed

1456
01:49:51,575 --> 01:49:54,975
standing up to the awesome
power of Viktor Drago.

1457
01:49:54,977 --> 01:49:56,912
He's not going anywhere.

1458
01:50:00,516 --> 01:50:02,391
Break him again.

1459
01:50:06,223 --> 01:50:08,523
Viktor Drago
looks tired, Max.

1460
01:50:08,525 --> 01:50:12,027
Keep in mind, he's never had to go past
the 4th round in a professional fight.

1461
01:50:15,264 --> 01:50:17,665
- Hey! What was that?
- Take the point, ref!

1462
01:50:17,667 --> 01:50:19,099
And Drago drops Creed

1463
01:50:19,101 --> 01:50:20,767
- with two nasty body shots.
- Come on!

1464
01:50:20,769 --> 01:50:22,970
- He held him and hit him.
- One.

1465
01:50:22,972 --> 01:50:26,206
Viktor holding and maybe
getting away with something there.

1466
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:28,275
The ref must not have seen it.

1467
01:50:30,279 --> 01:50:31,878
Come on.

1468
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:34,081
I think Rocky Balboa has
a decision to make here, Jim.

1469
01:50:34,083 --> 01:50:35,683
He knows better than anyone

1470
01:50:35,685 --> 01:50:39,386
how this same story played out
three decades ago.

1471
01:50:39,388 --> 01:50:41,154
Donnie, Donnie, talk to me.

1472
01:50:41,156 --> 01:50:42,456
Donnie.

1473
01:50:42,458 --> 01:50:43,756
Your ribs?

1474
01:50:43,758 --> 01:50:45,227
You think it's broke?

1475
01:50:51,434 --> 01:50:52,684
Finish him!

1476
01:50:55,237 --> 01:50:56,703
What do you wanna do,
Donnie?

1477
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,807
You wanna call it?

1478
01:51:04,613 --> 01:51:05,980
I didn't think so.

1479
01:51:06,516 --> 01:51:08,724
High, low! High, low!

1480
01:51:11,019 --> 01:51:12,552
Now he's gonna
come after you,

1481
01:51:12,554 --> 01:51:15,021
and he's gonna try to break
on that rib some more.

1482
01:51:15,023 --> 01:51:16,456
But that's okay.

1483
01:51:16,458 --> 01:51:18,124
'Cause you like the pain.
You can take it.

1484
01:51:18,126 --> 01:51:21,294
You know why?
Because you're dangerous.

1485
01:51:21,296 --> 01:51:23,597
- I'm dangerous.
- That's right.

1486
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,099
Ten seconds out.

1487
01:51:42,216 --> 01:51:44,317
Now here we go
with round ten

1488
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:46,686
of what has become a war of attrition.

1489
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:51,123
Drago seemingly ahead on the scorecards,
but Creed refusing to back down.

1490
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:53,125
That's it, Donnie. Good.

1491
01:51:53,127 --> 01:51:56,062
Creed using whatever
he has left in the tank.

1492
01:51:56,064 --> 01:51:57,896
Drago working the body.

1493
01:51:57,898 --> 01:51:59,200
Tie him up!

1494
01:52:04,305 --> 01:52:06,339
And down goes
Creed again.

1495
01:52:06,341 --> 01:52:09,042
And this could be the end of the fight.

1496
01:52:38,706 --> 01:52:40,140
Get up, D.

1497
01:52:52,018 --> 01:52:55,353
No man should be able to
fight through that beating,

1498
01:52:55,355 --> 01:52:57,222
but Adonis Creed
wills himself off the canvas.

1499
01:52:57,224 --> 01:52:59,023
- What's your name?
- Creed.

1500
01:52:59,025 --> 01:53:00,427
What's your name?

1501
01:53:00,926 --> 01:53:02,229
Creed!

1502
01:53:05,732 --> 01:53:07,465
Box!

1503
01:53:07,467 --> 01:53:10,835
Adonis Creed knows there
is no way around Viktor Drago.

1504
01:53:10,837 --> 01:53:12,539
He has to go through him.

1505
01:53:14,374 --> 01:53:15,475
Dig!

1506
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:17,742
Dig! Dig!

1507
01:53:17,744 --> 01:53:19,377
Creed suddenly finding
another gear!

1508
01:53:19,379 --> 01:53:20,380
Come on!

1509
01:53:21,681 --> 01:53:23,681
Drago's on his heels.

1510
01:53:28,287 --> 01:53:30,389
And down goes Drago!

1511
01:53:32,692 --> 01:53:34,427
That's it! That's right!

1512
01:53:35,595 --> 01:53:37,430
What a wild turn
of events.

1513
01:53:38,475 --> 01:53:39,475
Get up!

1514
01:53:40,667 --> 01:53:42,332
Two.

1515
01:53:42,334 --> 01:53:44,501
Donnie, he gets up,
you go after him.

1516
01:53:44,503 --> 01:53:45,571
Three.

1517
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:48,307
Four.

1518
01:53:50,342 --> 01:53:51,477
Five.

1519
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:55,212
- Six.
- Drago beats the count.

1520
01:53:55,214 --> 01:53:59,518
I can't believe either of
these guys are still on their feet.

1521
01:54:04,657 --> 01:54:06,024
Box.

1522
01:54:10,162 --> 01:54:14,565
Drago seemingly so far ahead on
points, he just needs to stay upright

1523
01:54:14,567 --> 01:54:16,400
and make it to the end.

1524
01:54:16,402 --> 01:54:20,036
Here comes Creed again, driving
Drago back into the ropes.

1525
01:54:20,038 --> 01:54:21,640
- Dig! Dig! Dig!
- Yeah!

1526
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:26,044
Come on, take him down!

1527
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:28,547
Come on, baby.

1528
01:54:32,417 --> 01:54:34,585
And Viktor Drago is down!

1529
01:54:34,587 --> 01:54:36,252
Again!

1530
01:54:36,254 --> 01:54:38,624
What a turn this fight has taken.

1531
01:54:49,167 --> 01:54:51,567
Creed doubled over
in pain

1532
01:54:51,569 --> 01:54:54,606
as Drago tries to
pick himself up off the floor.

1533
01:55:14,102 --> 01:55:15,685
Get up.

1534
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:28,338
Drago summons the strength,
manages to make the count.

1535
01:55:42,219 --> 01:55:44,586
They're still
swinging, Max.

1536
01:55:44,588 --> 01:55:46,656
Creed continuing
to connect.

1537
01:55:46,658 --> 01:55:49,491
And this is becoming
hard to watch, Jim.

1538
01:55:49,493 --> 01:55:51,928
I don't think Drago
has anything left,

1539
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:54,331
but he refuses to give up.

1540
01:56:18,355 --> 01:56:20,288
And that's it! It's over!

1541
01:56:21,692 --> 01:56:23,725
Drago's corner
throws in the towel.

1542
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:27,329
And Adonis Creed
defends his title.

1543
01:56:27,331 --> 01:56:29,129
Defends his name.

1544
01:56:29,131 --> 01:56:31,332
Creates his own legacy.

1545
01:56:31,334 --> 01:56:36,638
He is still the heavyweight
champion of the world.

1546
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:42,176
And the Russian crowd is standing
and cheering for the American fighter.

1547
01:56:57,159 --> 01:56:59,094
Where's B at? Where's B?

1548
01:56:59,096 --> 01:57:00,929
Easy, easy, easy.

1549
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:04,233
Hey, back up. Everybody back up.
We need air.

1550
01:57:04,867 --> 01:57:06,202
Yeah.

1551
01:57:09,372 --> 01:57:11,273
- We did it.
- We did it.

1552
01:57:25,144 --> 01:57:26,603
It's okay.

1553
01:57:27,353 --> 01:57:29,145
It's okay.

1554
01:57:35,196 --> 01:57:36,932
- Let's go home.
- Let's go, D.

1555
01:57:43,773 --> 01:57:46,207
I'm good, Ma.
I'm good.

1556
01:57:53,381 --> 01:57:56,083
- I did it. I did it.
- You did it.

1557
01:57:56,085 --> 01:57:57,552
Hey, Unc.

1558
01:58:10,765 --> 01:58:12,567
It's your time.

1559
01:58:30,418 --> 01:58:32,754
Hey, okay, back up.

1560
01:59:11,725 --> 01:59:12,994
What's up, Pops?

1561
01:59:18,398 --> 01:59:21,001
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come see you.

1562
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:28,942
I'm not sure how
this is supposed to go. Um...

1563
01:59:32,279 --> 01:59:35,647
I guess I should tell you that
Mom's doing pretty good.

1564
01:59:35,649 --> 01:59:38,317
You know, she's holding up.

1565
01:59:40,353 --> 01:59:42,587
So is Rocky.

1566
01:59:42,589 --> 01:59:43,789
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

1567
01:59:43,791 --> 01:59:45,391
<i>He's a tough dude.</i>

1568
01:59:47,194 --> 01:59:49,362
<i>I can see why you liked him.</i>

1569
01:59:51,732 --> 01:59:54,966
I also see why
you wanted to fight him, too.

1570
02:00:03,877 --> 02:00:05,378
Look, um,

1571
02:00:07,346 --> 02:00:09,649
I just came here
to tell you that...

1572
02:00:16,123 --> 02:00:17,723
That I did it.

1573
02:00:21,394 --> 02:00:23,629
But I didn't do it for you.

1574
02:00:27,066 --> 02:00:28,701
<i>Or because of them.</i>

1575
02:00:30,736 --> 02:00:34,073
<i>I did it because
it was my fight.</i>

1576
02:00:36,108 --> 02:00:38,044
<i>And when I stepped
into that ring,</i>

1577
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,782
it wasn't just about me.

1578
02:00:46,052 --> 02:00:47,053
Hello.

1579
02:00:49,555 --> 02:00:51,188
You must be Logan.

1580
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:52,623
Yes. Who are you?

1581
02:00:52,625 --> 02:00:54,625
Lo, who is it?

1582
02:00:54,627 --> 02:00:58,461
<i>Sometimes we think we
have to do it all on our own.</i>

1583
02:00:58,463 --> 02:00:59,866
Hey, Robert.

1584
02:01:01,167 --> 02:01:02,534
<i>But we don't.</i>

1585
02:01:03,836 --> 02:01:06,939
I was just around
in the neighborhood, so...

1586
02:01:13,212 --> 02:01:14,947
This is your grandfather.

1587
02:01:26,491 --> 02:01:30,227
You look just like his mother.

1588
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:33,565
Yeah, I know.

1589
02:01:40,572 --> 02:01:42,874
I wanna introduce you
to somebody.

1590
02:01:53,585 --> 02:01:55,419
Do you wanna come inside?

1591
02:02:02,961 --> 02:02:04,327
Yeah.

1592
02:02:04,329 --> 02:02:05,764
Give me that.

1593
02:02:15,941 --> 02:02:19,574
- Is that a ball?
- Yeah.

1594
02:02:19,576 --> 02:02:21,612
- Wanna play catch?
- Yes.

1595
02:02:22,713 --> 02:02:24,149
There you go.

1596
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:26,217
This

1597
02:02:27,885 --> 02:02:31,520
is your granddaughter. Amara.

1598
02:02:31,522 --> 02:02:33,557
Say what's up to Pop-Pop.
