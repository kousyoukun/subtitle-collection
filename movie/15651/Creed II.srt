1
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,760
一定能贏
Yeah. We got this.

2
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,630
今晚可是光榮的拳王之夜 羅伊
...here at the MGM Grand tonight, Roy.

3
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,400
你知道嗎 阿多尼斯·奎迪之前惜敗於「俊小子」裏基·康蘭
And, you know, when Adonis Creed lost to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan,

4
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,410
但他的橫空出世 引起了大家的好奇
he was really a curiosity more than anything else.

5
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,310
那真是一場激烈的比賽
But that was an epic fight,

6
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,610
從那以後 他一口氣取得了六連勝的戰績
and since then, he's reeled off six straight wins,

7
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,980
而今晚他又將對戰「特技演員」丹尼·惠勒
and tonight attempts against Danny "The Stuntman" Wheeler

8
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,110
馬克斯·凱勒曼 羅伊·瓊斯

9
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,640
水平等級
23勝1負 賽記 33勝0負
28 年齡 35
185厘米 身高 182厘米
97公斤 體重 95公斤
182厘米 臂展 180厘米
阿多尼斯·奎迪 丹尼·惠勒

10
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,350
共同競爭世界重量級拳王寶座
to become the heavyweight champion of the world.

11
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,390
值得一提的是 奎迪在上次與惠勒的熱身賽中
It bears mentioning that Creed actually wagered his Mustang

12
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,790
把自己的福特野馬都賭輸了 羅伊
before their sparring session, Roy.

13
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,930
據說這輛福特野馬 今晚又被惠勒當成了賭注
And rumor has it that same Mustang is on the line again tonight.

14
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,370
好了 都出去吧 我們走
Okay, everybody out. Let's go.

15
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,510
- 還好嗎 - 好
- Feel good? - Mmm-hmm.

16
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,210
記住要一直出右拳 好嗎
Yeah. Remember to keep your right hand up, okay?

17
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,050
他的左拳和右拳一樣厲害
His left is just as strong as his right.

18
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,050
好
- Yep. - Yeah.

19
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,210
你去大便過了嗎

20
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,330
那就好
- Mmm-hmm. - Mmm-hmm. Okay, good.

21
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,800
保持平常心就行 好嗎
It's just another fight, okay?

22
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
你一定能贏的
You got this.

23
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,340
奎迪隊

24
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,050
從台下到台上只有三個台階
You know, there's only three steps into that ring.

25
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,320
三個而已
Just three.

26
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,760
可今晚它們會像山一樣高不可攀
And tonight, it's gonna look as high as a mountain.

27
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,430
當你鑽過圍繩之後
And when you climb through them ropes,

28
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,630
會立刻陷入孤立無援的境地
it's gonna be the loneliest place in the world

29
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,900
因為站在你對面的拳手
because you're gonna be in there with another fighter

30
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,240
只想把你擊倒
who wants to take you out.

31
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,040
現在你必須問問自己
So now, you gotta ask yourself,

32
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,480
你來這兒到底是為了不辜負別人
are you here to prove something to other people

33
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,420
還是為了無愧於自己
or prove something to yourself?

34
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,050
我想無愧於自己
To myself.

35
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,760
很好
Right.

36
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,090
現在換我來問你問題
Now, let me ask you something.

37
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,090
你問
What?

38
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,730
你頭髮怎麼了
What's with the hair?

39
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,330
我仔細梳了梳 今天可是大日子
I combed it. It's a special night.

40
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,370
你是不是該操心點別的事 小滑頭
Shouldn't you be thinking about something else, wise guy?

41
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,780
好了 去證明自己
Now, you can go prove it.

42
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,480
把你那輛野馬給贏回來
Now go get your Mustang back.

43
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,620
兩位拳手在第四回合真是打得難解難分
These guys have really been mixing it up here in the fourth.

44
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,020
目前 年輕氣盛的奎迪壓制了經驗老到的惠勒
So far, Creed's youth outweighing Wheeler's experience.

45
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,990
逼他後退 加油 兄弟
Let's go! Let's go, baby. Let's o!

46
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,690
阿多尼斯·奎迪的這場比賽最振奮人心的地方
Maybe the most amazing part of Adonis Creed's journey, Roy...

47
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,230
別放鬆 穩點
Don't drop that guard! Sit.

48
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,560
就在於他今晚的搏殺
...is that tonight, he fights...

49
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,530
繼續出拳
Keep your hands up!

50
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,000
是為了接過他的教練洛奇·巴爾博亞
...for the same belt held by both his trainer, Rocky Balboa,

51
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,930
和他的父親 偉大的阿波羅·奎迪 都嬴過的那條金腰帶
and his father, the great Apollo Creed.

52
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,010
惠勒好像要發力反擊了 這一幕似曾相識 羅伊
Wheeler seems to be waking up. We've seen this before, Roy.

53
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,280
一旦發現機會 惠勒就會變得無人能擋
When Wheeler smells blood, he really turns it on.

54
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,220
再來 繼續再打
Come on back.

55
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,230
加油 多尼
Come on, D!

56
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,200
放在三年前 奎迪就輸定了
Three years ago, that's a knockout.

57
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,500
可如今惠勒的力量已經不如以往 奎迪肯定也察覺到了這點
Wheeler's power just isn't the same, and no doubt Creed can sense it.

58
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,700
他不行了 咬緊他
You got him. Stay on him!

59
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,970
奎迪是志在必得啊 現在簡直卯足了全力
Creed's on a mission, really pressing the issue now.

60
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,740
他揮出了一記雷霆萬鉤的左勾拳
And a big left hook lands flush!

61
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,450
奎迪對惠勒如影隨形 持續出擊 不躲也不停
Creed staying in the pocket, Max. Moving, not running.

62
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,380
再加把勁 出拳
Come on, now! Hands up! Hands up!

63
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,850
兩位拳手真的都拼盡了全力
These two men are really going at it.

64
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,690
幹掉他 多尼
Tell him, Donnie!

65
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,950
又一記左勾拳 惠勒連連後退
Another left hook drives Wheeler back.

66
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,190
加油 兄弟
Come on, baby!

67
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,260
奎迪冷不丁從空隙裏揮出一記上勾拳
That was a sneaky little uppercut on the inside,

68
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,990
惠勒受到了重創 羅伊
and Wheeler's hurt by that, Roy.

69
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,590
沒錯 他的腿抖得厲害
Yeah, that wobbled his legs pretty bad.

70
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,760
- 又是一記重擊 - 出拳 出拳
- Another big shot! - Hold him, hold him, hold him!

71
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,400
奎迪壓制住惠勒了 馬克斯
Creed has him in trouble, Max.

72
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,140
惠勒正在奮力抵抗 但是
Wheeler's doing what he can...

73
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,940
惠勒倒下了
Wheeler is down!

74
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,440
惠勒倒在了拳台上
Wheeler has hit the canvas!

75
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,080
你就趴著吧 小子
Now stay there, boy!

76
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,640
我奎迪才是贏家
Creed taught you!

77
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,080
讓他把車鑰匙還我
Come and give me my keys!

78
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,350
快起來 加油 兄弟
Get up! Come on, baby!

79
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,820
快起來
Get up, get up!

80
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,450
- 惠勒掙扎著想站起來 - 一
- Wheeler, trying to get up. - One!

81
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,150
- 趴著吧 - 二
- Stay down! - Two!

82
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,620
但不知能否趕在倒計時結束前起身
I don't know if he makes this count, Roy.

83
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,990
三
Three!

84
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,220
四
Four!

85
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,320
五
Five!

86
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,330
六
Six!

87
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,590
七
Seven!

88
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
八
Eight!

89
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,830
九
Nine!

90
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,260
結束了
That's it. That's it.

91
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,530
比賽結束了 馬克斯
And it's over, Max.

92
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,800
難以置信 阿多尼斯·奎迪
No way! Adonis Creed...

93
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,470
還我車鑰匙
Give me my keys!

94
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,140
他登上了世界重量級拳賽的拳王寶座
...is the heavyweight champion of the world.

95
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,850
你知道你成拳王了嗎
You know what you just did?

96
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,110
知道
Yeah.

97
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,550
寶貝 你知道發生什麼了嗎
Baby, you know what just happened?

98
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,350
大家可以想想這個年輕人的出身
When you think of where this kid has come from,

99
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,060
以他的起點是不可能當上拳手的 羅伊
the most unlikely beginning for a fighter, Roy.

100
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,790
按照他的成長路徑
Growing up the way he did

101
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,030
他能這樣一步一步地登上拳王寶座
to make it to the top of boxing in this way...

102
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,400
惠勒隊

103
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,400
可以說是史無前例
It's unprecedented!

104
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,370
奎迪 奎迪 奎迪
Creed! Creed! Creed!

105
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,170
成為頭號拳王競爭者是一回事
It's one thing to be the number one contender.

106
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,270
真正成為拳王則完全是另一回事
It's a whole other thing to be champion.

107
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,880
今晚就是他稱霸拳壇 續寫拳王傳奇的第一步
This is the first step to building a legacy of his own,

108
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,990
我已經迫不及待想看到阿多尼斯·奎迪 會有怎樣的未來
and I can hardly wait to see what's next for Adonis Creed.

109
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,260
這個怎麼樣
I mean, what do you think?

110
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,760
這
That's...

111
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,530
這真是太漂亮了
That is beautiful.

112
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,760
- 是吧 - 是
- Right? - Yeah.

113
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
我們得快點
But we gotta hurry up.

114
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,960
她隨時都可能洗完澡出來的
I mean, she's about to get out the shower any second.

115
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,970
多尼 你之前怎麼都不告訴我呢
Yo, Donnie, why didn't you tell me about this before?

116
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,170
我又不確定能不能贏
I didn't know if I was gonna win.

117
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,140
和能不能贏有什麼關係
What's that got to do with it?

118
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,140
我說不好
I don't know.

119
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,210
好了 你教我怎麼做
Look, just tell me what I should do.

120
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,740
你得單膝下跪
You get down on one knee.

121
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,980
這一套還沒過時嗎
People still do that shit?

122
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,650
發短信求婚也不是不行
You can always send her a text.

123
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,320
拜託 大叔 我是認真的 好嗎
Come on, Unc, I'm being serious, all right?

124
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,780
你怎麼求婚的
I mean, what did you say?

125
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,850
- 跟艾德裏安嗎 - 對
- To Adrian? - Yeah.

126
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,950
那是很久前的事了
It was a long time ago.

127
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,320
我們去了動物園 那時還是冬天 下著雪
We were at the zoo. It was winter. It was snowing.

128
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,330
空氣非常清新
Everything smelled fresh.

129
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,600
有一隻老虎 背上落著一層雪花
There was this tiger. He had snow on its back.

130
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,360
- 它在遠處走來走去 然後 - 好了 我知道了
- And he's walking in the background. - Okay, I get it. I get it.

131
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,930
你就說你怎麼求的
Just tell me what you said.

132
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,670
我正要說這段呢
Well, I was getting to that part.

133
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,400
我當時就問她
What I said is...

134
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,410
會不會特別反感跟我結婚
I asked if she would not mind marrying me very much,

135
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,880
我這麼說就等於含蓄地暗示 她是我的一切
which is kind of a dumb way of saying she's my world,

136
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,550
是她拯救了那個原本會墮落的我
and she made me better than I deserved to be.

137
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,080
你懂的
You know?

138
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,620
是這樣
Yeah.

139
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,460
聽著 你就乾脆別想太多
Listen, why don't you just turn off your brain

140
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,530
把真正的心裏話說給她聽
and let your heart do the talking.

141
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,360
敞開心門
Click.

142
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,400
你會如願的
You'll do good.

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,370
- 不用想太多 - 沒錯
- Turn my brain off? - Yeah.

144
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,740
好的
- Okay. - Mmm-hmm.

145
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,640
好的 明白
- All right. - All right.

146
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,070
沒錯 我知道了
All right, I'm on it.

147
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,310
大叔
- Hey, Unc. - Mmm.

148
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,320
你沒事吧
You good?

149
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,690
沒事 好著呢 謝謝
Yeah, real good. Thank you.

150
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,120
- 真的挺好 - 好
- Great. - All right.

151
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,650
嫁給我 好嗎
Will you marry me?

152
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,160
聽著 比安
Listen, B.

153
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,000
我們已然在一起好幾年了
I know we've been dating for a few years now,

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,200
而且我們倆相處得挺合拍
and it's just something about us that just click.

155
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,040
我不知道怎麼解釋 可是
I don't know how to explain it,

156
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,140
你陪在我身邊的那種感覺其實讓我
but the feeling I get when you're by my side is a feeling

157
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,080
已經戒不掉了
that I can't live without.

158
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,350
我知道很瘋狂 但是我就是想跟你說 那個
I know I sound crazy, but, look, I guess what I'm trying to say is...

159
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,690
嫁給我 好嗎
Will you marry me?

160
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,360
我還是很餓 寶貝
I'm still hungry, babe,

161
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,690
也不知道怎麼了
I don't know why.

162
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,230
你認真的嗎
Are you for real, D?

163
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,970
是 我很認真
Yeah, I'm for real.

164
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,730
別鬧 不要耍我
No, stop playin'.

165
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,870
我沒耍你
I ain't playin'.

166
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,170
你沒聽見 對吧
You didn't hear any of that?

167
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,180
聽見什麼
None of what?

168
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,380
我沒聽見什麼
None of what, D?

169
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,230
你說了什麼
What did you say?

170
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,670
你已經知道我說什麼了
Nothing that you don't already know.

171
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,370
提醒我一下
Remind me.

172
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,670
我說了我很愛你
I said that I love you,

173
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,380
還有我很需要你
and that I need you.

174
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,950
多尼 你知道你在幹什麼嗎
D, do you know what you're doing right now?

175
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,350
我算是知道吧
I mean, yeah, kind of.

176
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,820
什麼叫算是
What do you mean, "kind of"?

177
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,560
寶貝
Babe!

178
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
我是
I mean...

179
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,390
想跟你說心裏話
To keep it real with you, B,

180
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,560
我只想跟你
you're the only person

181
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,570
分享我人生的點點滴滴
I wanna share my moments with.

182
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,570
所以 比安卡·泰勒
So, Bianca Taylor,

183
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,380
嫁給我好嗎
will you marry me?

184
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,280
嗯
Yo.

185
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,720
嗯
Yo.

186
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,620
- 那這算答應了 - 是的
- "Yo"? Is that a yes? - Yes.

187
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,720
這算答應了麼
It's yes?

188
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,990
是的
Yes!

189
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,230
好
Yeah.

190
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,280
維克托
Viktor.

191
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,990
這小子狀態不錯啊
Our boy's looking good.

192
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,820
好消息都聽說了吧
I'm sure you heard the good news.

193
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,890
機會來了
It's time.

194
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,270
你有沒有想過搬回洛杉磯去住
You ever thought about going back to LA?

195
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,500
算了吧 你可是費城人
Please, you're a Philly girl.

196
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,940
話是這麼說 但是
Yeah, I guess,

197
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,270
那邊有更大的發展空甸
but it'd be nice to have more space.

198
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,410
再說 你媽媽也在那邊
And your mom's out there...

199
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,840
還有不少唱片公司
And them labels, too.

200
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,280
我有機會讓更多人聽到我的音樂
Could help me get my music out to more people.

201
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,990
我總感覺我在費城發展到頭了 你懂吧
I don't know, I feel like I've done everything I could in Philly, you know?

202
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,090
我能做音樂的時間也不多了
Time ain't exactly on my side, you know?

203
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,440
那洛奇怎麼辦
What about Rocky?

204
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,640
洛奇有自己的生活啊
Rocky has his life, D.

205
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,080
我們也得考慮未來
We gotta start ours.

206
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,950
今天可真冷啊 艾德裏安 真的很冷
It's a cold one today, Adrian, that's for sure.

207
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,150
我之前給咱們的兒子博比打了幾次電話
I tried calling our son Bobby a few times.

208
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,920
但是每次他要接的時候我就又給掛了
But I'd hang up every time he was about to pick up

209
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,660
因為說實話我不知道要說什麼
because, to tell you the truth, I didn't know what to say to him.

210
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,890
艾德裏安·巴爾博亞 生於1950年3月10日
卒於2002年9月11日

211
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,760
要是他新生活過得好好的
What if he's moving on,

212
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,400
我以前沒管過也 現在卻去插一腳
and I'm like this chunk of yesterday trying to be today?

213
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,670
也挺不合適的
I just don't fit in.

214
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,770
可我到底該怎麼做呢
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

215
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,810
敲開他的門直接說 你好嗎
Knock on his door and say, "Hey, how you doing?

216
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,680
咱們有多久沒見了 這不太好吧
"What's it been, a lot of years?" I don't know.

217
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,000
我想你
I miss you.

218
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,170
麥克斯餐廳 酒吧

219
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,190
自從你贏回這輛車就一直很興奮啊
You've been hype ever since you got this jawn.

220
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,490
你說什麼呢
What are you talking about?

221
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,960
就是這個笑容
That smile right there.

222
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,560
都笑開花了
You're cheezin'.

223
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,460
我爸就留給我這麼輛車
It's the only thing my pops left me.

224
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,630
當然了 還有拳頭
I mean, that and these hands.

225
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,000
- 你沒說過這事 - 是
- You never told me that. - Yeah.

226
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,740
你怎麼會藏著這麼多秘密啊 多尼
What's up with you and these secrets, Don?

227
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,280
你怎麼樣 好
How're you doing? All right, all right.

228
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,110
艾德裏安餐廳

229
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,050
看這邊
But look at this, here.

230
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,890
- 你怎麼樣 - 你好
- How you doing? - Hey.

231
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,790
- 伊莎貝爾 - 洛奇
- Hey, Isabelle. - Hey, Rock.

232
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,990
聽著 那邊坐了一個大塊頭 一直在等你
Hey, listen. Some big guy's sitting over there, waiting for you.

233
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,730
他說你知道他是誰
He said you'll know who he is.

234
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,470
拳王
Yo, champ.

235
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,740
你得跟這傢伙打 兄弟 打得他心服口服
You gotta take that fight, man. Shut this dude up.

236
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,770
不會吧 惠勒還沒認輸嗎
No, Wheeler still talking shit?

237
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,340
還不到再跟他打的時候
It's a little early for a rematch, bro.

238
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,380
電視聲開大點
Hey, turn the TV up.

239
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,080
拳壇歷史上的悲劇又將兩代人扯到了一起
...and the tragic history that connects them.

240
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,600
是你
That you?

241
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
這些照片不錯
Nice pictures.

242
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,010
是 都照得挺好
Yeah, they're okay.

243
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,110
但是裏面沒有我的
No pictures of me.

244
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,050
沒有 我這兒確實沒你的照片
No, there's no pictures of that.

245
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,320
你怎麼在費城
Why are you in Philly?

246
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,620
你不知道嗎
You don't know?

247
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,590
維克托·德拉龍向阿多尼斯·奎迪宣戰
Ukrainian boxer Viktor Drago appeared today in Philadelphia

248
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,560
於今日現身美國費城
to issue a very public challenge

249
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,690
公開宣佈自己要挑戰最近加冕的世界重量級拳王阿多尼斯·奎迪
to recently crowned heavyweight champion Adonis Creed.

250
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,770
拳賽經紀人巴迪·瑪塞勒日前為此召開了記者招待會
A press conference was held earlier by boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle.

251
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,100
我們專程來費城就是告訴你這不是開玩笑
We came all the way to Philly to let you know it's serious.

252
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,110
我身邊這位可不像丹尼·惠勒那麼弱
Now, this man here, he ain't no Danny Wheeler.

253
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,710
而且說實話奎迪是在惠勒巔峰期過了三年後才贏的
And let's be honest, Creed fought him three years too late, anyway.

254
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,950
贏了不稀奇
Easy match.

255
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,250
你在這個國家備受愛戴
People in this country love you.

256
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,990
但在我的國家
But Russia,

257
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,060
德拉戈之名無可撼動
no one touch Drago name.

258
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,060
可是那一晚的比賽改變了一切
Everything changed that night.

259
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,160
你看 那件事都已經
Look, you know, that's like

260
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,000
已經是八百年前的事了
a million years ago.

261
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,570
可對我卻仿如昨日
Like yesterday to me.

262
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,740
你大老遠到我這兒來就想說這個嗎
So, you came all the way over here to tell me that?

263
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,010
阿波羅·奎迪的兒子剛剛捧回金腰帶
It's no coincidence that Ivan Drago's son shows up

264
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,980
伊凡·德拉戈的兒子就出現 這恐怕不是巧合
right after Apollo Creed's son claims the belt.

265
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,150
這是奎迪家對德拉戈家的復仇之戰
This is Creed versus Drago.

266
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,680
也是一場萬眾期待的世紀之戰
This is the fight the whole world wants to see.

267
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,020
阿多尼斯理應接受挑戰
And this is the fight he should take.

268
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,720
除非他害怕歷史會在自己身上重演
Unless he's afraid of history repeating itself.

269
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,860
這段歷史指的是1985年那場殘酷的比賽
That history being the infamous 1985 match

270
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,300
傳奇拳手阿波羅·奎迪在比賽中
in which boxing legend Apollo Creed was killed by Russian fighter

271
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,000
死在了俄羅斯拳手伊凡·德拉戈的拳下
Ivan Drago.

272
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
而阿波羅的教練洛奇·巴爾博亞
Apollo's trainer Rocky Balboa was heavily criticized

273
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,870
也因未能及時叫停比賽 遭受到了巨大的譴責
for failing to stop that fight.

274
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,310
多尼 寶貝
D. Baby.

275
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,080
他們就是在炒作而己
It's a publicity stunt.

276
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,710
這種事別放心上
Don't worry about that.

277
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,820
後來
And let's not forget,

278
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,320
在同一年 德拉戈又被巴爾博亞所擊敗 而且是在自己的家門口 俄羅斯
later that year, Balboa defeated Drago in his own backyard, Russia.

279
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,030
就因為你 我失去了一切
Because of you, I lose everything.

280
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,900
祖國
Country.

281
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
我的尊嚴
Respect.

282
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,840
還有妻子
Wife.

283
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,470
你有沒有見過烏克蘭的流浪狗
You ever see stray dogs in Ukraine?

284
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,240
它們日日夜夜忍饑挨餓
They go for days with no food.

285
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,250
還要受人類唾棄 一無所有
People spit on them. They have nothing.

286
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,010
無家可歸
No home.

287
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,120
它們一心只想著生存 還有戰鬥
Only will to survive, to fight.

288
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,120
我有個兒子
I have son.

289
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,300
他只會用拳頭
All he knows

290
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,770
拚命
is this.

291
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,280
我的兒子會打敗你的徒弟
My son will break your boy.

292
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,080
我有點累了
Been a long day.

293
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,780
就說到這兒吧
I think we're done here.

294
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,260
我們這裏可不會讓流浪狗到處亂吠
Because around here we put strays away.

295
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,380
這張照片不錯
It's good picture.

296
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,890
我就猜到你會在這裏
I kind of figured you'd be here.

297
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,500
我之前不停地給你打電話 可是一直就沒有人接
You know, I tried calling and calling, but nobody picked up or anything.

298
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,240
你不覺得剛比完就訓練 有點操之過急嗎
Kind of early to be training, don't you think, after a fight?

299
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
我是想醒醒腦
Just trying to clear my head.

300
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,510
我明白了
I get that.

301
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,910
這反正比看心理醫生便宜
Cheaper than a shrink, that's for sure.

302
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,880
多尼 好了 我知道發生了什麼
Hey, Don, come on. I heard what's going on.

303
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,080
但是你不能讓他們擾亂你
But you can't let them get inside.

304
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,890
不過你的心情我也理解
But I know how you're feeling.

305
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,190
- 是嗎 - 真的 我懂
- Oh, do you? - Yeah, I do.

306
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,160
那些恩怨都過去那麼久 跟你一點關係都沒有
What happened a long time ago, that ain't got nothing to do with you.

307
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,570
聽著 那場比賽是阿波羅自己想打的 懂嗎
Listen, that fight is what Apollo wanted, all right?

308
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,470
雖然不該發生
It shouldn't have happened.

309
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,470
可這是命
But it did.

310
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,870
別再糾結了
And you gotta let it go.

311
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,480
放下
Come on.

312
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,720
你看過維克托比賽嗎
You've seen him fight, though?

313
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,020
我在體育頻道和其他節目上看過
I've seen him on sports TV and stuff like that.

314
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,290
他很壯 可惜太嫩
He's big, but he's raw.

315
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,090
他可打不過你這麼老到的拳手 我敢肯定
He ain't no mean machine like you are, that's for sure.

316
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,560
這樣好了
You know what?

317
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,130
我幫你振作一下 今天你算是撞大運了
I'm gonna cheer you up, 'cause today's gonna be your lucky day.

318
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,100
提前給你個聖誕禮物吧
Christmas just came early for you,

319
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,200
我來親自為你扶沙袋 幸運的小子
'cause I'm gonna hold the bag, lucky guy.

320
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,170
- 不 幸運的是你 - 為什麼
- No, you're the one who's lucky. - How's that?

321
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,710
因為我讓你有幸為我扶沙袋
'Cause I'm gonna let you hold the bag for me.

322
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,310
不錯
Yo.

323
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,480
這一拳更好
That's it. That's better.

324
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,890
世界級拳王 世界拳擊理事會

325
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,410
奎迪挨了好幾拳 看來比賽快結束了
Creed taking major hits. This could be over soon.

326
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,250
奎迪倒地了 而且他可能受了重傷
Creed is down! And he could be badly hurt.

327
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,820
阿波羅倒在地上沒有反應了
Apollo on the floor looking unresponsive.

328
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,250
情況似乎不妙
This doesn't look good.

329
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,460
他完全不能動了
There is no movement.

330
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,040
2月23日 菲爾莫爾禮堂 比安卡

331
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,500
我年少時 眸中燦若晨星
♪ Glitter in my eyes And I was young

332
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,140
他們說我曾經桀驁不馴
♪ Know what they say I ran away from home

333
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,980
謝謝你讓我瞭解這個世界
♪ I thank you I learned the world

334
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,120
他們說我的心早已支離破碎
♪ They think I'm a broken girl

335
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,660
我只是喜歡這種迷失的感覺
♪ I think I'm in love with lost

336
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,490
她聲音真棒
Amazing voice.

337
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,070
我心已碎 但起碼它跳動過
♪ My heart cracked But at least it's touched ♪

338
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,540
抱歉 我在媒體前有點誇張
Sorry for the theatrics.

339
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,270
可大家就愛看好戲
But people like a good show.

340
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,270
你這招太賤了 夥計
That was a grimy move, brah.

341
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,070
我不是針對你
Ain't nothing personal.

342
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,880
我對拳壇的現狀是沒什麼自豪感
Can't say I'm proud of what our sport's become,

343
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,110
可世道就是這樣
but that's the game.

344
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,780
隨便你怎麼說
Call it whatever you want.

345
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,420
反正在我聽來你就是想賺錢
Sounds to me like you just trying to get paid.

346
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,090
錢只是順便賺來的
The money is a side effect.

347
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,360
阿里那場世紀大戰的盛況可不是憑空出現的
"The Rumble in the Jungle" didn't just manifest itself.

348
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,290
得有人組織策劃
Somebody had to make it happen.

349
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,030
把願望變成現實
Will it into existence.

350
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,930
你要當這人 是吧
Oh, yeah, that's supposed to be you, huh?

351
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,370
你在這圈子還見過誰是真正關心拳手利益的
You see anybody else standing here with a care in their heart?

352
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,970
你我想要的都一樣
I want the same thing you want.

353
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,600
是嗎 我要什麼
Yeah? What's that?

354
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,310
在拳壇的歷史上
In the history of boxing,

355
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,140
一共出現過77位重量級的拳王
there have been 77 heavyweight champions.

356
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,410
這你知道嗎
You know that?

357
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,420
你覺得大眾認識幾個
But how many do you think they know?

358
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
四個嗎
Four?

359
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,550
五個嗎
Five?

360
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,690
有金腰帶不夠
The belt ain't enough.

361
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,200
你得有故事 能讓大眾長時間津津樂道
You need a narrative. Something that sticks to the ribs.

362
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,960
你父親 他就很懂
Your dad, he knew that.

363
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,640
我勸你還是好自為之
Do yourself a favor, brah,

364
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,140
趁早收手別惹禍
and quit while you ahead.

365
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,310
你想明哲保身
Self-preservation.

366
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,110
至少這點你比你老爸強
At least you got that over your old man.

367
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,350
是洛奇吹耳邊風攔著你吧
That must be Rocky whispering in your ear.

368
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,560
我是認真的
I'm serious.

369
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,690
她的聲音真不錯
Amazing voice.

370
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,800
謝謝 菲爾莫爾
Yo, thank you, Fillmore.

371
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,700
非常感謝
For real though, thank you.

372
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,910
你怎麼樣 小子
How you doing, kid?

373
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,380
我們談談吧
We gotta talk.

374
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,220
那咱們散散步 透透氣
Let's take a walk and get some air.

375
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,320
好嗎 這屋裏有點悶
Okay? Kind of stuffy in here.

376
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,220
你看那燈
Look at that light.

377
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,190
那玩意兒已經壞了好幾年了
That thing's been broken for a couple of years.

378
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,160
我都要煩死了
It's driving me crazy.

379
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,760
市政局不給修 也不理我
City won't fix it or nothing.

380
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,800
燈亮不起來
What good is a light

381
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,130
那還有什麼用啊
that don't light, right?

382
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,840
這事挺逗 但這麼一看 也夠傻的
Kind of funny, but it's stupid, too.

383
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,280
我要接受挑戰
I gotta take the fight.

384
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,980
為什麼
Why?

385
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,780
那兩個混蛋殺了我爸
These dudes killed my pops.

386
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,450
結果現在還招搖過市胡說八道
Now they're parading around, talking shit?

387
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,720
我不能放過他們
I can't let that slide.

388
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,560
我是拳王對嗎
I'm the champ, right?

389
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,960
對
Yeah.

390
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,530
所以我別無選擇
So I ain't got a choice.

391
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,530
選擇嗎
Choice?

392
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,200
你爸爸當年也說過這句話
That's the same thing your father said,

393
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
然後我就眼睜睜看著他死在我懷裏
and he died right here, in my hands.

394
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,440
你看看他的選擇讓你媽媽受了多少苦
Look what his choice put your mother through.

395
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,480
你不想這種事落在比安卡頭上吧 孩子
You don't wanna really bring all that stuff up again, do you, kid?

396
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,280
我以為你能懂
I thought you would get it.

397
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,210
如果我不接受挑戰 我現在就得受著煎熬
If I don't take this fight, I gotta live with it right now.

398
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,150
那孩子是在仇恨裏長大的 你懂我的意思嗎
That kid was raised in hate, you know what I'm talking about?

399
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,050
而你不是 別去報仇
You weren't. Don't do it.

400
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,490
- 可你去了 - 那不一樣
- But you did. - It's different.

401
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,690
哪裏不一樣
It was different?

402
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,430
很多地方不一樣
It's a lot different.

403
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,960
其實那晚跟德拉戈對打的應該是我
I was supposed to be in there with Drago that night

404
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,860
而不是你爸爸
and not your father.

405
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,800
我本來可以扔毛巾認輸
And I could've thrown in the towel,

406
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,500
可我沒有
but I didn't.

407
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,700
我活該抱憾終身
And I gotta live with that.

408
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,070
後來我去找德拉戈報仇
And when I did get in that ring,

409
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,080
他的慾望摧毀了我的信念
that guy broke things in me

410
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,650
這輩子都無法復原
that ain't never been fixed.

411
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,650
這麼做不值
It's not worth it.

412
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,490
一點也不值
Not at all.

413
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,160
你為什麼想跟他打
Why do you wanna fight?

414
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,060
什麼意思 我剛剛都告訴你了
What are you talking about? I just told you why.

415
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,490
不 你沒有 多尼
No, you didn't, Donnie.

416
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,490
你到底為什麼想跟他打
Why do you wanna fight?

417
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,360
我知道他們為什麼跟你打
I get why they wanna fight you.

418
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,760
我知道他們父子想要什麼
I know what they're fighting for.

419
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,870
那你呢
What about you?

420
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,640
聽我說 你的人生什麼都輸不起
Listen to me, you got everything to lose.

421
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,370
而他沒什麼可輸的
He's got nothing to lose.

422
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,810
如果一個拳手沒什麼可輸的 那就太可怕了
When a fighter ain't got nothing to lose, he's dangerous.

423
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,910
我也不是吃素的
I'm dangerous!

424
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,780
你覺得我打不過他
You think I'm gonna lose.

425
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,950
我沒這麼說
I didn't say that.

426
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,890
你不是說過他沒什麼經驗嗎
Same guy that said he ain't have enough experience.

427
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,960
- 太嫩 對吧 - 對
- Raw, right? - Yeah.

428
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,160
可你還是覺得我打不過他
But you don't think I could beat him.

429
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,670
你是想說這個嗎
- Is that what you're trying to say? - No.

430
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,070
不 我想說的不是這個
No, that's not what I'm saying.

431
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,230
我是說我不可能永遠在這兒守著你
I'm saying I'm not gonna be here forever.

432
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,670
你這話是什麼意思
And what's that supposed to mean?

433
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,570
意思就是你得想清楚 別犯傻
That means you gotta do some smart thinking.

434
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,640
你覺得你守著我是犯傻嗎 洛奇
Oh, you wanna talk about smart decisions, Rock?

435
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
你孤零零住在這屋裏
You in this house all alone.

436
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,580
誰照顧你的 我
Who been taking care of you? Me.

437
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,020
我一直守著你
I've been here for you!

438
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,850
還有誰這麼對你
Who else you got?

439
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
聽著
Listen.

440
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,730
不管你支不支持 我都會應戰
I'm taking this fight with or without you.

441
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,610
我沒法支持你
It's gotta be without.

442
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,240
我做不到
I can't do it.

443
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,580
就這樣了嗎
So that's it?

444
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,920
你就這麼不管我了
You walkin' out on me?

445
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,990
這次你倒是不用糾結要不要再認輸了
At least you ain't gotta worry about throwing in the towel this time.

446
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,290
是啊
Yeah.

447
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,400
是啊
Yeah.

448
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,300
多尼 你還好嗎
D, are you okay?

449
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,030
洛奇那傢伙
Rocky, man.

450
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,330
洛奇怎麼了
Rocky what?

451
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,800
他拒絕幫我備戰
He ain't training me for the fight.

452
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,370
等等 你要接受挑戰嗎
Wait, you're taking the fight?

453
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,040
我們經歷了那麼多
All the shit that we've been through.

454
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,710
他說不管我就不管我了 簡直混蛋
He gonna leave me high and dry. That's bullshit!

455
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,580
他得癌癥都是我在照顧
I took care of him when he had cancer.

456
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,210
不然他早死了 比安
He could've been dead, B.

457
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,950
洛奇肯定有他的理由
I'm sure he has his reasons.

458
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,020
是嗎 什麼理由
Oh, yeah? Like what?

459
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,550
什麼理由
Like what?

460
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,020
我才不用他管
I don't need him.

461
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,980
我喜歡這裏
I love it.

462
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,980
我也是
Me, too.

463
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,550
我想在那間屋子辟一個小角落 佈置工作間
I want just a little piece of that room for a studio.

464
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,980
沒問題 隨便佈置
That works. It's all you.

465
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,590
怎麼了
What's wrong?

466
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,620
說不清可 能是一路飛過來有點累了
I don't know. Maybe I'm just a little tired from the flight.

467
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,690
沒事的
I'm okay.

468
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,990
那我們就別出去了
We don't have to go out.

469
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,660
不如待在家裏 叫個外賣
We can just stay in, order some food.

470
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,530
不 寶貝 你得見見你媽媽
Hmm. No, baby, you have to tell her.

471
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,440
你還在唱歌嗎
So, how's the music?

472
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,010
多尼沒告訴你嗎
Oh, Donnie didn't tell you?

473
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,180
多尼
D?

474
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,890
我忘了
Uh... I forgot.

475
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,060
忘了 我簽了公司
Oh. Yeah, I signed.

476
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,890
真的嗎
Hello.

477
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,720
真的 特別棒 公司也開始給我籌備發唱片了
Yeah, it's great. The record label really hit the ground running, too.

478
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,330
今年夏天我就要去音樂節演出了
I'm up for festivals this summer.

479
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,260
- 真是恭喜你 - 謝謝
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

480
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,040
洛奇怎麼樣了
So, how's Rocky?

481
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,670
他不想過來玩玩嗎
He didn't wanna make the trip?

482
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,110
媽 你也知道他這個人
Nah, Ma, you know how he is

483
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,250
他不愛出遠門
with the traveling.

484
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,200
好吧 媽
Okay, Ma.

485
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,300
你肯定已經猜到了 不過
I'm sure you already guessed it, but...

486
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,500
沒錯
Oh, yeah.

487
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,530
我早就猜到了
I already know.

488
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,770
這麼愛吃咸的
All the salt,

489
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,510
頭髮也亮
shiny hair,

490
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,210
簡直容光煥發
glowing skin.

491
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,250
懷孕幾個月了
How far along are you?

492
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,620
媽 你是以為
Ma, you think...

493
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,290
你以為
You think...

494
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,130
不是
No.

495
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,530
我們都還沒 不是的 這真是
We couldn't even... No.

496
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,930
媽喜歡開玩笑
Your mamma's got jokes, okay.

497
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,300
不 我沒懷孕
No, I'm not.

498
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,530
好吧
All right.

499
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,050
- 結果是什麼 - 多尼 別碰
- What's it say? - D, don't touch it.

500
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,080
我又不在乎它上面有沒有尿 我只想看看
No, I don't care if you peed on it. I just want to see...

501
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,650
我是讓你別亂動它
I don't want you to mess it up.

502
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,290
怎麼樣
What's it say?

503
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,560
有兩條藍線
It's two blue lines.

504
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,230
兩條藍線 是什麼意思
Two blue lines? What does that mean?

505
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,660
兩條藍線
Two blue lines.

506
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,270
老天 它可能是壞了
Maybe it's broke.

507
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,480
這不可能
That's crazy.

508
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,990
我很猶豫 多尼
Hell, I don't know, D.

509
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,190
寶貝 我很猶豫
Baby, I don't know.

510
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,960
你一直都想要孩子 對吧
You did say you always wanted kids, right?

511
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,600
對 可我沒想這麼早要
Yeah, but I didn't say so soon.

512
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,340
我不知道我..我們
I don't know if I'm...

513
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,810
準備好了嗎
If we are ready.

514
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,020
現在準備也不遲
Let's get ready, then.

515
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,360
對
Yeah.

516
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,540
她告訴家裏人了嗎
Did she tell her family yet?

517
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,800
她現在就和她姑媽打電話呢
She's, uh, on the phone with her aunt right now.

518
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,170
比安卡可是好姑娘
Oh, that Bianca's a good one.

519
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,150
她怎麼會答應嫁給你呢 我是真想不通
Why she agreed to marry you, I do not know.

520
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,350
其實我也想不通
I don't know either.

521
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,820
你們回來可真好
Oh, it's good to have you home.

522
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,990
媽
Ma, um...

523
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,900
那場比賽
That fight

524
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,200
你知道
between me

525
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,330
對手是伊凡·德拉戈的兒子
and Ivan Drago's son...

526
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,840
我想接受挑戰
I'm gonna take it.

527
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,040
好吧
Okay.

528
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,950
就這樣嗎
That's it?

529
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,480
那你還想聽我說什麼
What else is there to say?

530
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,820
難道你不擔心嗎
So, that doesn't bother you?

531
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,390
我怎麼可能不擔心
Oh, you think this doesn't bother me?

532
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,620
可你是成年人
You're a grown man.

533
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,620
我和別人怎麼想對你來說都不重要
It doesn't matter what I or anyone else thinks.

534
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,430
你想跟那個人打是你的事情
You wanna fight this man, that's your business.

535
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,260
你又不需要我祝福你
You don't need my blessings.

536
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,860
洛奇不也沒祝福你嗎
You clearly don't have Rocky's.

537
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,240
洛奇理解不了
Rocky don't get it.

538
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,140
死的不是他爸
It wasn't his dad.

539
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,240
我的人生都改寫了
It changed my life.

540
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,240
還有你的人生
Your life.

541
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,740
你難道不想爸爸嗎
You're telling me you don't miss him?

542
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,680
你說什麼
Excuse me!

543
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,180
別把這事扯到我頭上
Do not try to make this about me.

544
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,020
也別拿你爸爸給自己當借口
And don't pretend that it's about your father.

545
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,650
沒有你爸 你也成了世界拳王
You became the world champion without him.

546
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,890
可我好像不想當拳王
Then why don't I feel like it?

547
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,460
要是你爸還活著 他也會告訴你 他不想當拳王
If your father was here, he would tell you he didn't feel like it either.

548
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,830
可他不在了
But he's not.

549
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,140
我只希望你能陪自己的孩子成長
I just hope you'll be here for your child.

550

多尼 你那兩撮鬍渣撓得我癢癢
D, you're tickling me with that fake beard.

553
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,850
敢這麼說我鬍子
The disrespect.

554
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,820
給我和寶寶唱首歌
Why don't you sing for us?

555
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,360
不 我可不是你的點唱機
No, I am not your jukebox.

556
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,060
也別指望我光著腳 挺著大肚子
I'm not gonna be walking around here, barefoot and pregnant,

557
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,600
還給你做什麼三明治吃
making you sandwiches either.

558
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
你聽聽 不給做三明治 也不給唱歌
Did you hear that? No sandwiches, no singing.

559
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,070

Can't hear.

564

你知道這病可能遺傳吧
You know it can be hereditary, right?

565
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,070
一切都會好起來的

我明白你之前為什麼不教我了
I know why you didn't train me before.

576
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,580
我當時不夠格
I wasn't ready.

577
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,210
維克托夠格
You was right.

588
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,410
你不願意幫我沒關係
But if you ain't gonna do it for me,

589
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,620
就當是為他們

590
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,950
好好考慮一下
Think about it.

591
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,460
就當替他們了卻遺憾
Beat what they couldn't beat.

592
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,390
也能洗刷平反他們的名聲
Change the way they were remembered.

593
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,300
抓住這個機會 我們就能改寫歷史

00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,460
德拉戈按兵不動 還未發動有效攻擊
Drago hasn't thrown a meaningful punch yet.

688
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,460
奎迪又是一記右勾拳
And another right hand for Creed.

689
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,200
奎迪擋住了這一拳
Creed blocked that punch

690
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,570
不過他還是被逼到了場邊
and still it knocked him back into the ropes.

691
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,810
有兩下子
Yeah, we good.

692
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,840
奎迪有點生氣了 吉姆
Creed doesn't like that, Jim.

693
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,110
別被騙了 小子 他是想激怒你
Don't be stupid, kid. He's baiting you.

694
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,980
奎迪步步緊逼 帶著怒氣發起了猛攻
Creed pressing now, angrily rushes forward with a volley of punches.

695
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,020
他要你近身
He's pulling you in.

696
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,380
德拉戈這記左勾拳真是穩准狠
A huge left hook by Drago!

697
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,220
- 奎迪似乎被這一拳打懵了 - 加油
- Come on, kid. - Creed shaken up by that punch.

698
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,650
別有雜念
Clear your head.

699
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,060
奎迪佔據了拳台中央
Creed commands the center of the ring,

700
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,660
卻被狼狽地狠狠打中了左肋
but there's a hard body shot to the ribs.

701
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,030
現在右側也受到了重擊
And another one on the other side.

702
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,800
你怎麼了 兄弟 振作點 多尼
What you doing, baby? What you doing, D?

703
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,970
德拉戈揮出一記右勾拳 打得奎迪仰過頭去
And a right hand by Drago that knocks Creed's head back.

704
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,340
奎迪感受到了對手拳頭的力量
Creed can feel the power behind those punches.

705
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,070
現在德拉戈始正式反擊了
And now Drago is on the attack.

706
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,770
出拳 舉起拳頭 繼續
Jab out, jab out, jab out. Hands up, let's go!

707
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,010
德拉戈沿著圍繩步步為營
Drago's stalking him along the ropes.

708
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,480
別靠近圍繩 多尼
Get off the ropes, D!

709
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,150
別進角落
Out the corner!

710
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,980
不 多尼 離開角落
No, D! Out the corner, out the corner!

711
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,620
德拉戈猛地揮出右拳 奎迪被打都站不穩了
Hard right hand by Drago, and Creed is shaken

712
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,130
至此比賽的第一回合結束
as the first round comes to a close.

713
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,830
許多不在現場觀賽的觀眾 可能會有點驚訝
I think most watching at home are a little surprised

714
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,400
因為維克托·德拉戈
by how impressive Viktor Drago has looked

715
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,200
在剛開場的這幾分鐘裏表現得相當令人驚艷
in these opening minutes of the fight.

716
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,770
兩位拳手積怨已久
With the history these men share,

717
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,740
小公爵光是要讓奎迪免受情緒干擾
Duke may have his hands full keeping Creed

718
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,280
恐怕就已經費盡心力了
from letting his emotions get the best of him.

719
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,040
怎麼回事 多尼
What you doing, D?

720
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,210
- 你得按照咱們的計劃來 - 我知道
- You need to stick with the game plan. - I know, I know.

721
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,250
別靠近圍繩 調整角度 你沒掌握好角度
Stay off the line. Take your angles. You ain't taking your angles.

722
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,420
我知道
I know!

723
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,720
如果他對你出左勾拳 就得小心
If he throws you a left hook...

724
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,390
你再這樣擋他啊
Come on, man, hold the phone on that.

725
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,090
- 怎麼擋我會不知道 - 既然你知道
- You think I don't know that shit? - Well, if you know it,

726
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,190
那就擋啊
do it!

727
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,470
他害怕了

728
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,380
我能看出來

729
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,780
那你告訴我

730
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,650
為什麼你還沒打敗他

731
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,680
把他幹掉

732
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,540
現在第二回合即將開始 觀眾席上還是一片沸騰
And now, as we prepare for round two, this crowd is still buzzing

733
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,180
在第一回合的對決中 德拉戈揮舞的重拳之下是深沉的敵意
from the vicious rally that Drago brought forth in the last minute

734
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,080
他發起的連續攻擊 竟然在最後一刻
of round number one.

735
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,780
清醒點 別犯傻
Come out smart.

736
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,390
將奎迪打得全無招架之力
Got Creed in serious trouble as the round came to a close.

737
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,650
開始
Box!

738
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,150
現在第二回合開始了
And now, round two begins.

739
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,160
德拉戈一上來就發動了猛烈進攻 絲毫沒有遲疑
And Drago comes out throwing, wasting no time.

740
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,030
- 別靠近圍繩 - 奎迪又被逼退到場邊
- Get off the ropes! - And Creed is backed

741
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,570
他試圖躲開對方的強力攻擊
into the ropes, trying to avoid those power shots.

742
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,140
該死
Damn.

743
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,110
場上局勢迅速進入白熱化
Things just got ugly fast.

744
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:06,080
德拉戈又是一記強勁的右勾拳 奎迪現在真有大麻煩了
And another hard right hand shot, and Creed is in big trouble now.

745
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,620
腳下別停 多尼
Keep moving, Donnie.

746
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,920
這一記右勾拳打得奎迪雙腿發軟
A massive right hand sends Creed reeling.

747
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,890
他在重新調整步調
He tries to regain his footing.

748
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,690
再次試圖回擊
Creed trying to answer back.

749
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,830
又一記結實的勾拳 打得奎迪翻出了圍繩
And now a huge hook sends Creed flying through the ropes!

750
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,000
挺住
Come on, kid.

751
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,410
二
Two!

752
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,510
三
Three!

753
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,680
四
Four!

754
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,740
五 六
Five! Six!

755
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,010
很好
That's it, that's it, that's it.

756
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,310
奎迪 奎迪
Creed! Creed!

757
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,150
- 你還好嗎 - 還好
- You okay? - Yeah.

758
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,820
開始
Box!

759
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,090
現在奎迪必須找到
Creed needs something

760
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,490
扭轉戰局的辦法
to try to turn this fight around.

761
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:49,790
把他幹掉

762
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,130
德拉戈的重拳持續來襲
Drago just keeps coming.

763
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,560
奎迪左肋又受到重擊
What a big rib shot!

764
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,260
糟了
Shit.

765
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,000
連續兩記右勾拳挾雷霆之力 打在奎通的胸腔 這沉重的悶響
Those were two tremendous right hands to the rib cage.

766
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,530
都能傳到最後一排觀眾的耳朵裏
You could've heard that one in the nosebleed seats.

767
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,910
奎迪的痛苦顯而易見 但他還是盡力爬了起來
Creed clearly in pain, as he finds a way to his feet.

768
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,780
他並不打算放棄
Not ready to give up yet.

769
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,850
可怎麼說呢 情況不妙啊 吉姆
I don't know. This is getting dangerous, Jim.

770
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,020
你還好嗎 靠近我
Okay! Come to me!

771
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,190
拜利斯裁判讓雙方繼續比賽
And now, Bayless is gonna let him go again.

772
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,190
準備好
Ready?

773
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,190
開始
Box!

774
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,660
奎迪掙扎著離開角落
He comes barreling out of the corner.

775
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,360
一記右勾拳
Huge right hook!

776
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,030
德拉戈想速戰速決
Drago trying to end it.

777
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,600
奎迪在結束鈴響之前終於又揮出一拳
And Creed delivers a big right hand at the bell.

778
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,300
退後 退到角落裏去
Get back! Get back to your corner!

779
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,340
拜利斯攔住了德拉戈 德拉戈好像有點受挫
Bayless restraining Drago, seemingly frustrated...

780
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,740
聽我指揮
Obey my commands.

781
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,280
畢竟差一點就結束這一回合了
...as he was close to finishing the fight.

782
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,280
你得趕緊拿出本事來 不然我就得叫停比賽了
You got to show me something. If not, I'm gonna stop it.

783
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,610
你還能打嗎
Can you fight?

784
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,580
我能打 能打
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

785
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,920
你不能打了 我去叫停比賽
Hell no. I'm calling this fight.

786
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,290
兄弟 不要叫停
Nigga, don't call this shit.

787
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,060
兄弟 沒必要求別人認同你
You ain't got to prove shit to nobody.

788
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,190
你看看你 肋骨可能都斷了
Look at you. Your ribs look like they broke.

789
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,030
別叫停比賽
You can't call this fight.

790
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,530
他讓你成了個笑話

791
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,310
這就是為什麼這些人都看不起我們

792
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,690
這也是你媽拋棄我們的原因

793
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,870
就是這樣

794
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,280
把我的護齒拿來
Hand me my mouthpiece.

795
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,060
把護齒拿來
My mouthpiece.

796
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,700
別打了
Don't do it.

797
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,400
進入第三回合
Now, as we go to round three,

798
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,410
阿多尼斯·奎斯已經被打得精疲力盡 身受重傷
Adonis Creed has been beaten up and bloodied

799
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,740
德拉戈連續不斷的重拳出擊
by an avalanche of power shots

800
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,040
在前兩個回合讓他吃盡了苦頭
from Viktor Drago in the first two rounds.

801
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,880
我們看看阿多尼斯·奎迪還剩多少能耐
And we'll see how much Adonis Creed has left now,

802
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,450
他掙扎著想活下去 繼續戰鬥
as he tries to stay alive in the fight.

803
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,020
不要再打了
Stop the fight.

804
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,820
德拉戈強悍的臂膀虎虎生威
Dangerous swings from Drago

805
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,420
奎迪正在拚命抵擋對方的攻擊
as Creed desperately tries to hold him off.

806
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,020
德拉戈繼續對奎迪的身體發動猛烈攻擊
Drago's still putting huge pressure on the body.

807
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,930
搞什麼 快還擊啊
Come on, stop the fight!

808
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,060
德拉戈又揮出一記重拳
And another shot by Drago!

809
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,900
奎迪似乎已經撐不住了
Creed seemingly on his last legs!

810
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,800
可德拉戈未曾停手 反擊 多尼
- Drago on the attack. - Come on, D!

811
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,840
奎迪的胸腔受到了致命的一擊
Oh, and with a devastating shot to the rib cage.

812
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,140
停止比賽
Stop! Stop!

813
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:59,140
德拉戈應該被取消資格 至少看起來是這樣
This is an obvious disqualification, or so it would appear

814
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,110
因為他最後揮出那一拳時
because Creed was fully down

815
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:03,210
奎迪已經倒地毫無還手之力了
at the moment that Drago landed that last shot.

816
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,980
- 不 - 你這是要殺人麼
- No! - You wanna kill somebody?

817
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,280
- 不行 不行 - 冷靜點
- No way, baby. No! - Easy, easy!

818
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,050
- 不不不 - 別急
- No. No, no, no! - Come on.

819
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,060
冷靜點
No! Just relax.

820
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,640
整個體育場都陷入了沉默
This arena is completely silent

821
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,040
觀眾們都在等待
as the audience waits to see

822
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,980
醫護人員會為年輕的阿多尼斯·奎迪 診斷出怎樣的傷勢
what will be the condition of young Adonis Creed.

823
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:01,700
除了眼眶骨破裂 還斷了兩根肋骨 腦震盪程度三級
Cracked orbital bone, two cracked ribs, grade-3 concussion,

824
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,470
腎臟破裂 以及多處挫傷
ruptured kidney, numerous contusions.

825
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,080
腎臟破裂會不會...
A ruptured kidney, is that--

826
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,780
這些傷好好修養都能痊癒
His injuries will heal with rest and time,

827
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,550
包括腎臟
including the kidney.

828
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,750
現在來看沒必要動手術
Now, we shouldn't have to resort to surgery,

829
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,120
不過得留院觀察至少48小時 以防傷勢惡化
but we will need to keep him here for at least 48 hours, as a precaution.

830
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,790
還有 他現在麻醉勁兒還沒過去 不過再過一會兒肯定會醒的
Now he's still numb from the morphine, but he'll certainly feel it later.

831
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,990
- 好的 - 你還好嗎
- Okay. - You okay?

832
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,400
還好 我坐一會兒就行
Fine, I just gotta sit.

833
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,460
要是你感覺不對
If you're expecting...

834
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:30,830
不 我沒事
No, I'm fine.

835
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:33,940
不 我說真的 別太擔心 好嗎
No, no, seriously. Take it easy, okay?

836
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,240
打擾一下 尤厄爾醫生
Excuse me, Dr. Ewell.

837
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,510
有人找你 這邊請
You have a visitor. Right this way.

838
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,920
比安卡
Bianca.

839
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,820
我很抱歉事情變成這樣
Listen, I'm so sorry everything went...

840
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,820
我就該守著他
I should've been there.

841
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,090
真的對不起
I'm so sorry.

842
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,690
真的
I am.

843
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,860
我也很懊悔
Me, too.

844
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,860
我能看看他嗎
Is it okay if I see him?

845
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:06,640
對我們來說有區別嗎 現場情況大家都看到了
What difference do it make to us? We saw what happened.

846
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,440
裁判和組委會公正裁決就行
They doing what they supposed to be doing.

847
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,970
這我不管
I don't care.

848
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,680
對
Right. Okay.

849
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,940
好 知道了
Got it.

850
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,360
理事會不打算對裁判的裁決提出異議
WBC's not gonna contest the referee's decision,

851
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:31,360
所以維克托維持判罰
so Viktor remains disqualified.

852
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,060
取消比賽資格
Bottom line,

853
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,800
但至少你保住了拳王之名
you still the champ.

854
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,130
好了 我不打擾你休息了
I'm gonna let you rest, man.

855
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,670
你要是有事就叫我 我就在外面
So, if you need something, you know, I'm outside.

856
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,180
有人來看你 多尼
Got some company, D.

No, you guys gotta work it out.

870
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,640
這場比賽我根本必輸無疑 對嗎
I lost the fight before it even started, right?

871
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,710
不 不是
No. No, no.

872
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,540
不是 那傢伙個頭那麼大 太壯了
This guy was... He's a big guy, he's strong.

873
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,410
臂展又比你長 什麼條件都很好
He got the reach on you. He got all kinds of--

874
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,310
你又想指導我了嗎
Oh, now you're trying to train me?

875
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,950
想給我當教練嗎
Be my coach?

876
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,290
你看看我
No, look at me.

877
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,990
看看我
Look at me.

878
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,600
你還跑過來幹什麼
What are you still doing here?

879
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,940
你來收拾我的爛攤子嗎
Here to pick up the pieces?

880
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,840
不是
No.

881
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,840
幹嗎不待在費城
Shouldn't you be in Philly?

882
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,540
- 阿多尼斯 - 不 沒關係
- Adonis. - No, it's okay.

883
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,320
我不想讓他難受
I don't want him to get all...

884
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,390
你們好好互相照顧
Take care of each other.

885
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,120
對不起
I'm sorry.

886
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,000
好了 寶貝
Baby.

887
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,540
他是愛你的 多尼
He loves you, D.

888
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,420
看看我
Look at me.

889
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,520
我一直在看著你 寶貝
I'm looking right at you, babe.

890
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:15,620
我們的孩子會怎麼看我
How's that baby gonna look at me?

891
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,090
電梯

892
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,510
阿多尼斯 你真覺得自己是拳王嗎
Adonis, do you really feel like a champ?

893
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,680
你覺得你配得起金腰帶嗎
Do you think you deserve to keep the belt?

894
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,310
你那不叫贏 阿多尼斯
Why would you take that fight, Adonis?

895
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,250
阿多尼斯·奎迪就這水平嗎
Is this it for Adonis Creed?

896
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,960
沒事
I'm cool. I'm cool.

897
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:35,130
- 親愛的 讓我幫你吧 - 我說了 我能走
- D, please, let me help you, baby. - I said I can walk.

898
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,440
求你坐下吧 我說了 我能行
- Please sit-- - I said I got it.

899
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,760
我說不好
I don't know. Lately, it's like...

900
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:37,030
他最近好像跟以前不一樣了
He hasn't really been himself.

901
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,130
我理解
And I get it.

902
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:43,500
畢竟他很受煎熬
'Cause he's going through a lot.

903
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,670
他剛剛開始接受物理治療
He's just starting physical therapy.

904
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,810
在盡力恢復健康
Trying to get himself right.

905
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,880
但是
And

906
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,640
他有點
he's, uh...

907
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:55,710
冷漠
distant

908
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:59,920
而且 非常游離
and disconnected.

909
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:04,190
好像現在對他來說什麼都不重要
It's like nothing really matters to him right now.

910
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,460
包括我他也不放在心上
Including me.

911
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,790
這不像他
Which is new.

912
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:14,160
對
Yeah.

913
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:18,540
聽著 你得陪著他 好好照顧他
Listen, be there for him, take care of him,

914
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,770
付出你的愛
give him your love.

915
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:24,670
不過你也得明白
But also, you gotta realize he's in a place right now

916
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,740
他現在這個狀態只有靠他自己才能解脫出來
that only he can get himself out of.

917
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,440
可他正在經受的這有一切
And with everything he's going through--

918
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:29,910
你管他正在經受什麼呢
With everything he's going through?

919
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:32,450
他這一路上每步都有你的支持
You've been in his corner every step of the way.

920
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,820
可他是個成熟男人了
He's a grown man.

921
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,130
他需要自己從內而外的痊癒
He's gotta heal from the inside out.

922
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:46,000
相信我 我懂 我經歷過
Trust me, I know. I've been there.

923
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,580
感覺到了嗎
Feel her?

924
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,080
是
Yeah.

925
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,580
德拉戈的精彩表現讓所有質疑都煙消雲散
Highlights of Drago silencing critics tonight

926
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,650
第一回合就勢如破竹 將安東尼·諾瓦克擊倒出局
with a devastating first round knockout of Anthony Novak.

927
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,120
接下來馬克斯·凱勒曼將進行賽後採訪
Here's a post-fight interview with Max Kellerman.

928
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,890
維克托 距離你輸給阿多尼斯·奎迪
Viktor, here we are just months

929
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,120
那場有爭議的比賽 已經好幾個月了
since your controversial loss to Adonis Creed.

930
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,960
這次能贏感覺如何
How does this win feel?

931
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,530
我輸過嗎
What loss?

932
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,100
抱歉 我說的是
Excuse me.

933
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,500
你對戰阿多尼斯·奎迪卻被取消資格的事
From your disqualification to Adonis Creed.

934
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,030
好在你今晚贏了 感覺怎麼樣
But how does this feel to you tonight?

935
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,000
沒什麼感覺 我要再跟奎迪打
I don't care. Creed must fight me.

936
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,140
如果他不跟你打呢
And if he doesn't fight you?

937
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,070
那他就不算拳王
Then he's no champion.

938
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,310
你聽到了嗎 阿多尼斯 對方已經下了戰書了
There you have it, Adonis. Challenge is on the table.

939
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:20,680
我們非常為你驕傲

940
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,000
敬你 維克托

941
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,620
敬你們

942
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:29,450
願你的成功 能重現俄羅斯拳壇昔日的輝煌

943
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:31,280
你是我們的希望

944
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,240
維克托

945
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,710
請收下這份禮物

946
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,730
德拉戈

947
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,890
現在你們要做的

948
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:02,380
就是趁這一次比賽一舉奪下金腰帶 懂嗎

949
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,010
坐吧

950
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,070
你好 維克托

951
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:50,250
相信你一定覺得非常自豪吧

952
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,730
維克托
Viktor!

953
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,420
維克托

954
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,700
裏面那些人是為了我們專程到這兒來的

955
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,440
- 為了你來的 - 裏面那些人嗎

956
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,130
裏面那些人怎麼對你的 他們當年把你趕走了

957
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,620
- 我們為什麼非要到這裏來 - 這是為了將來

958
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,070
我根本都不算認識那個女人

959
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,540
我也巴不得不認識他

960
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,110
維克托

961
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,580
她當年拋棄了你

962
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,690
他們都是

963
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:31,280
那些人都把你給拋棄了

964
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,480
他們還羞辱你

965
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,850
是我輸了比賽

966
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,690
我當年輸了比賽

967
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:40,830
但你不會再輸下去了

968
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:55,740
德爾斐拳擊學院

969

車不錯
What's good?

970
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,820
好好保養 好久不見 忙什麼呢
Just maintaining, man. Long time no see, what's up?

971
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:16,530
也沒什麼事 就是瞎忙 裝修 待產
Nothing, man. Just been caught up. You know, the house, the baby.

972
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:17,660
你知道多麻煩
You know how it is.

973
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,760
好吧 比安卡好嗎
Yeah? How Bianca doing?

974
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,670
她挺好 挺好
She's good. She's good.

975
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:25,770
好
Good, good, good.

976
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:29,210
其實我一直很想聯繫你 兄弟
Listen, man, I've been meaning to hit you up, though.

977
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:32,240
理事會想知道我們下一場比賽跟誰打
Commissioner wanna know who we plan to fight next.

978
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,310
就算不跟德拉戈打
You ain't gotta fight Drago,

979
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,880
你也得跟別人打
but you gotta fight someone.

980
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,650
你得守住金腰帶
You gotta defend the belt.

981
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,850
不然它就要被收回去了
Otherwise, it's gonna be vacated.

982
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,660
你知道 我能幫你 選個好打一點的對手
I could set up a little, you know, tune-up fight, kind of.

983
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,770
算了 這樣吧
No. You know what, man?

984
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:56,830
你現在還是別操心這些事了
Don't worry about none of that right now.

985
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,440
就進來玩會兒吧
Listen, just come on inside.

986
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,610
打打沙包 熱熱身
Hit the bag, man, warm up.

987
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,370
好
Yeah.

988
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,110
我先去拿裝備 然後再進去找你
Yeah, I'm gonna grab my stuff, and I'm gonna meet you in there.

989
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,320
好吧 兄弟
All right, man.

990
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,390
用全身的重量出拳
Put your body weight into that glove.

991
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,260
這就對了 上前一步
There you go. Lean in it.

992
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,680
是啊 我都給你打了無數個電話了
Yeah, I called you, like, a thousand times.

993
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,710
是 我家燈壞了
Yeah, it's about the light.

994
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,010
壞了多久嗎
How long?

995
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,520
仔細算算 有好幾年了吧
You want to be specific? Couple years.

996
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,250
對
Yeah.

997
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,760
只是擰個燈泡而已 用得了幾個人
I mean, how many guys does it take to screw in a light bulb?

998
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,090
我可沒開玩笑
I'm not joking.

999
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,100
瑪麗·安·奎迪寄  洛奇·巴爾博亞 收

1000
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,960
我再打給你們好嗎
Can I call you guys back?

1001
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,130
行
Yeah.

1002
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,590
他仍然需要你 瑪麗·安

1003
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,000
媽
Hey, Ma.

1004
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,140
媽
Ma.

1005
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:58,920
媽媽
Hey, Ma.

1006
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,090
最近好嗎 小子
How you doing, kid?

1007
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,360
你過來幹什麼
What are you doing here?

1008
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,230
希望你別介意
I hope you don't mind,

1009
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:12,370
是你媽媽請我過來的 因為她非常擔心你
your mom asked if I would come out 'cause she's worried about you.

1010
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,040
我也是
I am, too.

1011
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,970
我很好
I'm good.

1012
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,140
你不用大老遠過來一趟
You didn't have to come all this way.

1013
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,950
我坐火車來的
By train.

1014
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:28,520
在車上待了三天
Three days on a train.

1015
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,880
也挺好 你知道 我有思考的時間了
It's all right, you know, gives you time to think.

1016
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:35,690
可以看著風景 像明信片一樣從窗外閃過
And you watch all these places whipping by the windows like postcards.

1017
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,660
也是一種不錯的經歷
It's quite an experience.

1018
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,930
是 你開心就好
Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

1019
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,800
是 真挺好
Yeah, it was nice.

1020
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,360
這個房間太棒了
This is wonderful.

1021
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:47,940
這兒怎麼能有這麼多的獎盃呢
How you have all this out here.

1022
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,610
你也能有這麼多獎盃
You could have the same.

1023
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,340
是嗎 我可沒有自信
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

1024
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,840
我說的不只是榮譽
I mean, not just the shiny stuff,

1025
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,410
有些東西更有價值
but the better stuff.

1026
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:01,980
比如更好的人生
Have a better life.

1027
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,360
做更好的人
Be a better man.

1028
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:12,930
知道嗎 我其實一直在想你之前質問我說
You know, I was thinking about what you were saying about

1029
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:16,800
我是不是覺得留在原地守著你就是在犯傻
what smart decisions have I made lately.

1030
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,240
但沒想出個結果
Couldn't think of many.

1031
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:28,110
跟你說我兒子的兒子
You know, I wasn't even there when my son's son,

1032
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,380
就是我的親孫子
my grandson,

1033
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,180
他出生時 我沒去
was born.

1034
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:38,520
他現在可能都已經長這麼高了
I mean, he's like that tall now probably.

1035
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,460
我卻還不認識他 他也不認識我
I don't even know him. He doesn't know me.

1036
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,460
真的很可悲
It's pathetic.

1037
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,500
那幹嗎不給他
Well, why won't you just

1038
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:53,170
打電話
call him?

1039
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:55,540
沒那麼容易 你懂嗎
It ain't that easy, you know...

1040
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,440
聽著
Listen,

1041
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,540
我不希望你重蹈覆轍 犯我犯過的錯
I don't want you making the same mistakes I made.

1042
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,310
你懂我意思嗎
You know what I mean?

1043
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,150
所以你要問問你自己
So, you gotta ask yourself,

1044
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:13,720
到底什麼東西才是有價值的
what's the valuable stuff?

1045
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,760
我以前也問過你類似的問題
It's like I asked you before.

1046
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,430
你一路奮戰到底是為了什麼
What were you really fighting for?

1047
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,130
我之前很怕
I was afraid.

1048
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,930
榮譽
Of this.

1049
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:32,910
怕達不到別人的期望
Expectations.

1050
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:35,310
怕當拳王
Being the champ.

1051
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:40,910
我怕我自己達不到爸爸的高度
I was scared I couldn't do what he couldn't.

1052
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,550
挺奇怪的
It's weird.

1053
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,260
我曾覺得他是我的一部分
I used to feel like he was apart of me.

1054
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:53,460
現在我卻聽不到他的召喚了
Now I can't hear him, or that thing,

1055
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,490
我聽不到他讓我上拳台奮戰
that thing that tells me to get in the ring.

1056
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,030
要腳下不停 一直舉著拳頭
Move my feet, keep my hands up.

1057
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,370
打倒所有阻擋我的東西
Hit anything that gets in my way.

1058
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,570
我再也聽不到了
I can't hear it anymore.

1059
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,780
我都不知道我怎麼輸的
I don't even know how I lost.

1060
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,950
你這麼想就不對
Your mind wasn't right.

1061
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:26,290
其實你天生就不適合走你爸爸這樣傳奇的路線
And your natural style just won't work with a guy that big.

1062
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,570
那我更適合你的路線嗎
You saying yours was better?

1063
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,310
我贏過 不是嗎
I won, didn't I?

1064
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,380
- 見到你真好 - 我也很開心見到你
- Good seeing you, Unc. - Great to see you, too.

1065
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,220
我之前跟你媽媽仔細聊過一陣 她說
I was talking with your mother,

1066
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:56,690
你給你的孩子起了個名字叫做
and she says you came up with this name for the child.

1067
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:57,960
- 阿瑪拉 - 阿瑪拉
- Amara. - Amara.

1068
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,190
- 是 - 好
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1069
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,860
有什麼問題嗎
Why, what's wrong with that?

1070
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,360
不 沒事 這名字很好聽 就是有點不好念
No, it's a beautiful name, but it's kind of complicated.

1071
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,060
為什麼不起一個能讓人
Why don't you think about something,

1072
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,260
至少能讓我念得順口點的
at least I would, a little simpler to say,

1073
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:10,730
比如貝姬或者凱特之類的
like "Becky" or "Cate," something like that.

1074
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,140
凱特·奎迪
Cate Creed?

1075
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,970
凱特·奎迪 雙C開頭 挺好記
Cate Creed. Two "C's." Easy to remember.

1076
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,970
你知道黑人不起這種名字吧
You do know she's gonna be black, right?

1077
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,980
對啊 我給忘了
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1078
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:20,650
好吧
Okay.

1079
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,450
- 喂 媽 - 好吧
- Hey, Ma. - Yeah.

1080
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,690
等等 現在嗎
Wait, right now?

1081
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,250
- 放鬆點 - 好的
- Relax. - Okay.

1082
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,690
什麼事都不會有
- Everything's gonna be fine. - Mmm-hmm.

1083
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:35,730
你就是到這裏來陪她的 懂嗎 你就做這個
You just gotta be there for her, okay? That's your job.

1084
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:36,860
我明白
I got you, I got you.

1085
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,530
你記好
- And remember-- - Yeah.

1086
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,960
你這輩子的巔峰時刻就是今天 就是在這兒
Today is gonna be the best day of your life. Right here.

1087
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:44,100
- 懂嗎 - 懂
- All right? - Yeah.

1088
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,940
這是你的人生巔峰
Best day of your life.

1089
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,180
- 我要有孩子了 - 我感覺跟我有孩子了似的
- I'm having a baby. - I feel like I'm having a baby.

1090
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,580
兒子
- Boy! - Hey.

1091
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,180
- 你怎麼這麼晚 - 我知道
- What you doing? - I know--

1092
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,580
不 這沒關係 趕緊到裏面去吧
No, never mind. Just get in here.

1093
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:00,780
好
Okay. Okay, okay.

1094
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:03,250
我說過 你需要我 我一直在的
Like I said, I'll be here if you need me.

1095
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,690
- 好的 - 好
- All right. - All right.

1096
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,530
我會盡力去幫他
You know, I'm gonna do what I can.

1097
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:16,870
你能趕過來 就已經幫他太多了
You being here is more than enough.

1098
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:18,300
謝謝
Thank you.

1099
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:39,230

1100
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,150
巴爾博亞先生
Mr. Balboa?

1101
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,960
孩子生了
- Mmm. - She's here.

1102
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,730
那太好了
Oh, that's great.

1103
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:21,130
真是天大的好消息
That's absolutely good.

1104
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:22,800
真的是棒極了
That's fantastic.

1105
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:34,480
大叔 跟你的教女打個招呼
Hey, Unc, say hi to your goddaughter.

1106
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,080
讓我做教父真榮幸
Wow. That's quite an honor.

1107
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,980
- 讓我看看你 - 你看看
- Let me see you. - Here she is.

1108
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,190
你好啊 小美人
Hey, hello, beautiful.

1109
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,620
對了 護士
So, nurse...

1110
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,700
檢查什麼時候做
...what about the test?

1111
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,960
你們先別急
Relax for now.

1112
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:58,840
聽性腦幹反應的檢查 等比安卡和阿瑪拉都休息好了就會安排人
We'll run an auditory exam as soon as you and Amara get some rest.

1113
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,870
沒關係 寶貝
It's okay, babe.

1114
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,370
幸好她長得像你
Thank God she looks like you.

1115
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,840
可不是嗎
Yeah, right.

1116
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,580
這檢查會不會讓她不舒服
So, is she gonna feel anything?

1117
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:18,990
不會 這是無痛檢查 保證不疼
No, it's painless. I promise.

1118
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,820
好了 人都就位了
Okay. Now that they're in place,

1119
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,790
現在我們要做的就是 給她一些短促的聲音刺激
what we're gonna do is give her a series of click stimuli

1120
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,230
音量大概有三十五分貝
around 35 decibels

1121
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:27,600
以檢查她的神經系統反應
and check her neural responses.

1122
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,160
聲音大不大
Is that loud?

1123
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,830
在正常音頻範圍內
Normal auditory range.

1124
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,270
好了
Okay.

1125
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,170
那就開始
Here we go.

1126
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,350
阿瑪拉·奎迪 聽性腦幹反應測試

1127
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:40,410
我們具體要看什麼
So what exactly are we looking for?

1128
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,310
讀數 看棘波
A reading. Spikes.

1129
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:18,050
好吧 目前看不到有任何棘波之類的波形
So, we're not seeing any waves or spikes, uh,

1130
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:20,810
因為孩子有家族病史擔心也是很正常的
and given your family history, there is some cause for concern.

1131
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,320
不過現在下結論太早
However, it is very early...

1132
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:52,050
醫生說還得做檢查
They're gonna run some more tests.

1133
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:56,550
下結論太早了 有時候也會有誤診的
They said it's early, and, uh, sometimes they get false reads.

1134
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,920
我問你一件事
Let me ask you something.

1135
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,330
如果真確診了呢
What if it ain't okay?

1136
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,830
我不能這麼想
I can't think like that.

1137
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,470
得想 不然
You gotta, I mean,

1138
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,640
真有事該怎麼辦
how you gonna handle it?

1139
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,650
我不願意想
I don't wanna go there.

1140
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:27,650
你會愛她嗎
You gonna love her?

1141
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,350
你怎麼問得出這種話 洛奇
How you gonna ask me a question like that, Rock?

1142
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,550
- 我會 我肯定會愛她 - 那就好
- Yeah, I'm gonna love her. - Good.

1143
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:35,590
阿瑪拉不會覺得自己有缺陷 所以
'Cause she ain't feeling sorry for herself,

1144
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,960
你也不該這麼覺得
and you shouldn't either.

1145
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:50,340
這是什麼
You got a little...

1146
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,340
拳擊手套
Oh, it's boxing gloves.

1147
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,980
- 是吧 - 是
- You got it? - Yeah.

1148
01:22:57,190 --> 01:22:59,420
奎迪

1149
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:05,660
恭喜 巴迪·瑪塞勒

1150
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,990
是《晚安 月亮》這書 我很喜歡
Goodnight Moon. I love that book.

1151
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:10,760
誰送的 寶貝
Who's that from, babe?

1152
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:15,730
被公認為最強拳壇新人的維克托·德拉戈
The unanimous number one contender Viktor Drago

1153
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,960
在他父親的故鄉俄羅斯
has been met with open arms back in Russia,

1154
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:20,200
受到了熱情的歡迎 可謂好事一樁
his father's home, which is nice.

1155
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,470
不過現在所有人最關心的一件事是 奎迪哪兒去了
But the question on everyone's mind is, "Where is Creed?"

1156
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:27,300
如果他再不快點選出比賽對手 就有被取消拳王稱號的危險
If he doesn't choose an opponent soon, he risks forfeiting the title

1157
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:30,940
而我想 他恐怕會無法承受這樣的打擊
and personally, I can't imagine him being able to live with that.

1158
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,510
怎麼了
You good?

1159
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,480
沒事 總算把她哄睡了
Yeah. Finally got her to settle.

1160
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:43,020
我得出去一趟 辦點事情
Hey, I need to get out of the house.

1161
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,560
我本來得去工作室的
I was gonna go over to the studio.

1162
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,830
我回來之前你能照看她嗎
You mind watching her until I get back?

1163
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,530
能 當然能
Yeah, of course.

1164
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,360
好
Cool.

1165
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:55,670
好啦 好啦
Okay, okay.

1166
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,440
好的
Yeah.

1167
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,580
還好嗎
You okay?

1168
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,880
我來 我來就好 對
Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

1169
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,450
好
Okay.

1170
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,750
拜拜
Bye.

1171
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:33,940
寶貝
Baby.

1172
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:36,110
乖 乖 別哭了
Baby, please.

1173
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:39,340
你餓了 對不對 你餓了 沒關係
Hey, you hungry, right? Hey, baby, you hungry?

1174
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:50,150
我是瑪麗·安 有事請留言
It's Mary Anne. Please leave a message.

1175
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,220
媽 聽著
Hey, Ma. Listen, listen.

1176
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:55,260
阿瑪拉一直在哭 你能不能告訴我
She won't stop crying. Can you just tell me how to...

1177
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,930
告訴我怎麼能讓她不哭
Can you tell me how to make her stop crying?

1178
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:59,430
你聽到就給我回電 好嗎
Call me back when you get this message, okay?

1179
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:33,830
你怎麼啦 乖女兒
Hey, what's up, baby girl?

1180
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:36,500
別哭
Hey, no.

1181
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,100
沒事的 寶貝
It's okay, baby. No, no.

1182
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,740
別哭 別再哭了
No, don't cry. No, not again, please.

1183
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,400
求你了
Please.

1184
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,410
你看
No, look, look, look.

1185
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:47,340
看見了嗎
You see that?

1186
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,650
看這兒
Look, look, look.

1187
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:50,980
看這兒
Look.

1188
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,560
我在這兒呢
I'm right here.

1189
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,510
對不起
I'm sorry.

1190
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,520
對不起
I'm sorry.

1191
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:03,550
對不起
I'm sorry.

1192
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,590
別哭 來抱抱
Hey. No, no, there you go.

1193
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:12,130
我知道
I know.

1194
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:16,900
最近爸爸表現很糟 我知道
Mmm-hmm. Daddy's being a bitch, I know.

1195
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,030
她怎麼樣
How'd you do?

1196
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:48,760
她非常堅強
She's a fighter.

1197
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,970
跟她爸爸一樣
Just like her dad.

1198
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,240
也跟她媽媽-樣
Just like her mom, too.

1199
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,990
我得跟他再打一次
I have to fight him again.

1200
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:15,360
我不想做你的絆腳石
I don't wanna be that person to stop you.

1201
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,560
但我也不想最後和你媽媽一樣孤獨
But I don't wanna end up like your mom, alone.

1202
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,990
我明白
I feel you.

1203
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
是嗎
Do you?

1204
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,400
我們都已經有孩子了 多尼
And it's not just us anymore, D.

1205
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,240
我知道再去自討苦吃一次聽起來很瘋狂
I know it sounds crazy doing all this all over again.

1206
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:36,110
但我不會被輕易擊潰
But this won't be the end of me.

1207
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,910
你也不會
Or you.

1208
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:39,650
絕對不會 因為我們一條心
It can't be, 'cause we a team.

1209
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:42,320
上次你擅自應戰就沒跟我一條心
We weren't a team when you took the fight the last time.

1210
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,290
你說得對
You right.

1211
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:49,690
對不起
I'm sorry.

1212
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:54,760
我不該讓你受這份罪
I shouldn't have put you through that.

1213
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,260
那你何苦呢
Then why?

1214
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,700
何苦還要打
Why do it again?

1215
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,970
你到底要證明什麼
What do you have to prove?

1216
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:04,570
跟證明什麼無關
It's not about that.

1217
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:08,180
而是人一旦放棄熱愛的事業就會失去自己的價值
You wouldn't be any good to anybody if you didn't do what you love.

1218
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:13,110
會連活都活不下去 對嗎
You wouldn't be able to breathe, right?

1219
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:17,220
所以如果不能好好把這件事做個了斷 那我以後就算廢了
Well, I wouldn't be any good to anybody if I don't handle this the right way.

1220
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,320
我需要你的支持
But I need you.

1221
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,690
我也捨不得女兒
Both of you.

1222
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,170
我一定會贏
I'll beat him.

1223
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:45,750
你只能贏
You better.

1224
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:51,390
這件事你必須好好考慮清楚
You gotta think about this real hard.

1225
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:55,650
你現在可是有家人需要照顧的
You got people that need you now.

1226
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,090
正因為這樣我才更不能輸
That's exactly why I can't lose.

1227
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:00,960
巴迪說要比只能在俄羅斯比
Buddy said the fight has to be in Russia.

1228
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,200
不然就別比
Take it or leave it.

1229
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:08,770
俄羅斯
Russia?

1230
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,170
他們的地盤
On their turf.

1231
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:12,140
那就去俄羅斯
So Russia it is.

1232
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:21,910
你說呢 洛奇
What you think, Rock?

1233
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:26,180
要是最後得靠裁判打分定輸贏 他們是有優勢的
It's a clear advantage if it comes down to a judge's decision.

1234
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:30,290
那就只好把他徹底擊倒 不勞裁判費心了 對嗎
Well, then we can't let it get to a judge's decision, right?

1235
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:35,460
真要命
Oh, shit.

1236
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:38,800
那聯繫巴迪嗎
Call the promoter.

1237
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:46,110
明早五點在這裏訓練嗎
So we train here tomorrow, 5:00 a.m.

1238
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:49,370
不 我有個新的計劃
No, I got other plans.

1239
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,140
- 你是說回費城去嗎 - 不
- You mean, you wanna go to Philly? - No.

1240
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:55,210
聽著 你要是想一鼓作氣扭轉 乾坤
Listen, you wanna change things in a big way,

1241
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,450
那就必須先讓自己脫胎換骨
then you need to make some big changes.

1242
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:55,110
來這兒練 你逗我嗎
You gotta be messing with me, right?

1243
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:59,010
聽說如果有哪個拳手想從頭來過
Heard this is a place where fighters go,

1244
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,910
都會來這兒練
you know, to start over.

1245
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:03,380
讓自己涅槃重生
Get reborn.

1246
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,490
怎麼這麼晚才到
What took y'all so long?

1247
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:10,920
找不到地方上廁所嗎
This some wild shit.

1248
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,790
是 對我來說簡直是地獄
Yeah, sure looks like hell to me.

1249
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:17,400
既然你之後又要挑戰地獄難度的對手 那就快點適應這裏
Since you're going back to hell, you might as well get used to it.

1250
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:21,500
開始吧
Let's go.

1251
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:35,980
加油干
Go for it.

1252
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,120
用力點
Harder.

1253
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,290
再用力點
Harder.

1254
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:46,290
還得用力
Harder!

1255
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:49,990
堅持
Keep going.

1256
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:06,340
脖子練結實
Build that neck.

1257
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:30,600
來 爺們點
Okay, man up.

1258
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,900
不用
No.

1259
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:34,940
我沒事
I'm good.

1260
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,880
在這兒打就這規矩 先腳碰腳 習慣就好
That's the fight it's gonna be. Toe-to-toe. Get used to it.

1261
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,110
開始
Box!

1262
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,520
扛住 用身體扛住
Take it to the body.

1263
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,100
忍住 要打敗疼痛
Take it! Fight the pain.

1264
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,100
還好嗎
You all right?

1265
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:30,390
把腳伸進去 伸進去再來
Get back in there.

1266
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:32,390
保護好自己
Get back in there. Protect yourself.

1267
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,460
加油 起來 孩子
Come on, get up, kid.

1268
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:36,360
站起來
Get up.

1269
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:41,300
腳下別停
Keep moving.

1270
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,200
這就對了
That's it.

1271
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:40,780
俄羅斯 莫斯科

1272
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:52,460
再過幾分鐘
We're just minutes away from the fight

1273
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:54,360
這場全球矚目的世紀大戰就將開始了
the whole world has been waiting to see.

1274
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,700
這一次是阿多尼斯·奎迪與維克托·德拉戈
The rematch between Adonis Creed and Viktor Drago

1275
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,930
第二次為爭奪世界重量級拳王開戰
for the heavyweight championship of the world.

1276
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:01,770
賽前有一點值得有提 吉姆
The unique thing about this fight, Jim,

1277
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:07,470
那就是阿多尼斯·奎迪在拳擊博彩中的賠率只有1:25 非常不被看好
is Adonis Creed comes in a 25-to-1 underdog,

1278
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,410
他可是衛冕的一方
and he's the champ!

1279
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:11,240
那相信大家都很好奇
Well, it's gonna be fascinating to see

1280
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:14,850
這件事對他踏上拳台後的心態 會有什麼影響
what that does to Creed's mindset as he enters the ring.

1281
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:17,580
德拉戈又會怎麼想呢
Not to mention Drago's.

1282
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:18,770
德拉戈

1283
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:24,560
德拉戈 德拉戈 德拉戈
Drago! Drago! Drago!

1284
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,540
德拉戈上場了
And there he is.

1285
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:17,540
先生們 女士們 維克托·德拉戈 現在正向體育場走來
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Drago! Making his way into the arena.

1286
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:21,380
雖然還沒有奪得金腰帶 但是在俄羅斯觀眾看來
He does not have the belt, but to everyone here in Russia

1287
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:23,180
甚至在全世界很多觀眾看來
and to many around the world,

1288
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:25,580
他才是真正的重量級拳王
he is the true heavyweight champion.

1289
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,590
要上場了 小子
It's time, kid.

1290
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,360
奎迪與德拉戈的這一戰無可避免
There was no way Creed could have run from this fight.

1291
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:19,070
因為粉絲的呼聲太高 希望他重返拳台與德拉戈再戰
There was such high demand for Adonis to step back in the ring with Viktor.

1292
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:23,870
我相信伊凡時隔多年回到祖國 應該感覺不錯
And I'm sure Ivan feels good to be back home after all these years.

1313
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:09,780
上吧 拳王
Come on up, champ.

1314
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:17,180
終於等到了 吉姆 奎迪與德拉戈火花四濺的二度對決
This is it, Jim. Creed versus Drago part two.

1315
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:18,750
奎迪今晚狀態不錯
Creed looks good tonight,

1316
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:21,290
不過他上次與德拉戈對決時的慘狀
but it's impossible to forget what happened to him

1317
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:24,220
我到現在還感覺歷歷在目
the last time he stepped into the ring with Drago.

1318
01:42:24,230 --> 01:42:28,300
他傷痕纍纍 其中最嚴重的 是一根肋骨被打至斷裂
Numerous injuries, not least of all, a nasty broken rib

1319
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,960
還有一側腎臟破裂
and a ruptured kidney.

1320
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:31,930
這次他有一大變化
A huge difference in this fight

1321
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:35,840
那就是他請回了著名教練 前拳王洛奇·巴爾博亞作為指導
is he's got former champ Rocky Balboa back in his corner.

1322
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,770
有洛奇坐鎮
And Rocky assures everyone

1323
01:42:37,770 --> 01:42:40,710
本場比賽奎迪應該會有脫胎換骨的表現
this fight will be very different from its predecessor.

1324
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:49,050
晚上好 女士們先生們 終於等到今晚了
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is it.

1325
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:51,180
本次十二回合制的
Twelve rounds of boxing

1326
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:56,160
世界重量級拳王衛冕賽 即將開戰
for the heavyweight championship of the world!

1327
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,220
女士們 先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

1328
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:00,990
讓我們為拳手們吶喊吧
let's get ready to rumble!

1329
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:08,000
你能感覺到今晚拳台上一觸即發的緊張感 吉姆
You can feel the nervous energy in the arena tonight, Jim.

1330
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,740
奎迪竟然有膽量再次面對
Creed has some courage to get back into the ring

1331
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:12,840
曾經差點終結自己職業生涯的對手
with a man who nearly ended his career.

1332
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:16,140
對拳王之位志在必得的德拉戈
A man who is hungry to be champ.

1333
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,380
兩位
Fighters,

1334
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,620
我要一場公平乾淨的比賽
I want good, clean fight.

1335
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:28,920
要乾乾淨淨的比賽

1336
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:31,160
我說分開 你們就分開
Break when I tell you to break.

1337
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:34,260
我讓你們退回場角 你們就回到場角
You go to your corner when I tell you to go to your corner.

1338
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:36,540
我說分開 你們就分開

1339
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:39,740
我讓你們退回場角 你們就退回場角

1340
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,030
碰拳套 祝你們好運
Touch gloves.

1341
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:45,100
洛奇·巴爾博亞和伊凡·德拉戈
Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago sharing the ring

1342
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:47,370
時隔三十年再一次站上了同一個拳台
for the first time in 30 years.

1343
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:52,240
所有人都知道 要備戰德拉戈這麼強的對手 只能找洛奇
If anyone knows how to take on a slugger like Drago, it would be Rocky.

1344
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:54,880
你知道你心裏燒著怎樣的火
You know you got the fire in your gut,

1345
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,250
而我知道你會在拳台上怎樣活
and I know you'll do what needs to be done.

1346
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:02,760
因為現在 你已經明白自己為什麼而戰
Because now, you know what you're fighting for.

1347
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:07,010
這一次無論如何 都要拿下金腰帶

1348
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:10,560
德拉戈上一次狠狠壓制奎迪的比賽戰術
Viktor overwhelmed Creed's previous game plan,

1349
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,600
現在阿多尼斯應該還有陰影
and I think it got in Adonis' head.

1350
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,860
你一定能贏

1351
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:16,400
所以我們都非常期待看到洛奇·巴爾博亞的訓練成果
It's gonna be interesting to see how Rocky Balboa has prepared Creed

1352
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,670
看他如何幫助奎迪備戰這場激烈對抗
for what is surely to become an all-out brawl.

1353
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:21,070
好了嗎
Ready?

1354
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,570
好了嗎
Ready?

1355
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:24,840
開始
Box.

1356
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,680
比賽正式開始
And we're underway.

1357
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:30,710
德拉戈連續打出了兩記勾拳 但奎迪躲開了
Drago comes out swinging with two hooks that Creed avoids.

1358
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,850
德拉戈又揮出一記重重的右勾拳
And a big right-hand right out of the gate.

1359
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,650
小心右拳 多尼
Watch that right, Donnie.

1360
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:38,060
德拉戈有點意外 奎迪竟然躲開了他的攻擊
Drago a bit surprised as Creed shakes that punch off.

1361
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,890
你還愣著幹什麼 繼續攻擊

1362
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,870
一記右直拳 德拉戈步步緊逼 不過奎迪並沒有就此退縮
Drago is pressing hard, but Creed is not backing off.

1363
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:50,030
腳下別停
Keep moving, keep moving.

1364
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,240
奎迪今晚與德拉戈對打 採取了貼身戰術
Creed working a little bit closer to Drago tonight.

1365
01:44:55,780 --> 01:44:58,610
剛才奎迪鬥志昂揚地打出子一套組合拳
That is a vicious combination by Creed.

1366
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:04,620
剛剛德拉戈揮出了右拳
And now a right hand by Drago.

1367
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:07,650
發力了 德拉戈開始向對手反擊了
Here we go, Drago applying pressure.

1368
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:09,020
別進場角 出來 多尼
- Out the corner! - Come on, Donnie!

1369
01:45:11,190 --> 01:45:13,660
奎迪一個閃身 離開了場角
Creed manages to slip away.

1370
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:16,060
放馬過來
Let's get it.

1371
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,900
怎麼樣
Yeah, what's up?

1372
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:22,730
兩個人在拳台中央周旋
Now they're squaring off in the middle of the ring, toe-to-toe.

1373
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,170
互有命中 勢均力敵
Taking blows.

1374
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,240
奎迪連續打中對手的臉
Creed staying in his face.

1375
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,010
鈴聲響了 激烈的第一回合比賽已經結束了
And there's the bell! As a wild first round comes to an end.

1376
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:29,610
回角落去
Go to your corner.

1377
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:31,410
德拉戈有些挫敗
Drago frustrated.

1378
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:33,040
今晚的奎迪就像換了個人似的 馬克斯
Creed is looking like a different fighter tonight, Max.

1379
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:34,680
很好 就該這樣
- That's it, D! That's it! - Yes!

1380
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:36,580
看誰還給德拉戈加油
Oh, yeah, who's saying Drago now, though?

1381
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,420
荒地裏那些苦沒白吃吧 是
See, all that work in the desert paid off, right?

1382
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:42,120
你得手了 他就得想辦法了
Yeah, you got him. You got him thinking.

1383
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:44,320
他本來沒想到你會這麼打
He wasn't expecting what you're bringing.

1384
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,690
下一回合他攻勢會更猛 但你準備好了
Now, he's gonna bring the heat the next round, but you're ready for it.

1385
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,080
我之前是怎麼訓練你的

1386
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,650
給我把他打趴下

1387
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,100
他右拳用得最多
He overextends his right hand.

1388
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,730
你先把拳頭擋住
You gonna counter with the right

1389
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:56,130
再用左拳擊垮他 懂了嗎
and crack him with the left. You got that?

1390
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:58,130
他出右拳 我就出左拳
Extend the right, crack him with the left.

1391
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:01,200
他絕對想不到這招 你爸當初就是這麼對付我的
He'll never expect it. His old man did the same thing to me.

1392
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:03,010
據我剛才的觀察 馬克斯
One early observation, Max.

1393
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:05,910
我覺得奎迪今晚在抵抗德拉戈的組合拳時
I think Creed is withstanding Drago's combinations

1394
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:08,040
表現得比上一場要好太多了
much better tonight than in the first fight.

1395
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:09,410
開始
Box.

1396
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:12,220
第二回合比賽開始
And round two begins.

1397
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:14,390
德拉戈揮出了強勁的左勾拳
Drago with a huge left hook.

1398
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,690
接著右手一記重拳
And a big right hand.

1399
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:21,520
德拉戈又發起一輪猛攻 現在把奎迪逼到圍繩邊了
Drago on the attack again, now driving Creed back into the ropes.

1400
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:24,160
他一直在出右拳 小心右拳
He's overextending the right! Watch the right!

1401
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,270
奎迪左右開弓 重拳出擊
A right and a left for Creed.

1402
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:32,030
出右拳給假動作

1403
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:43,210
好一記上勾拳 奎迪抱住了德拉戈
Huge uppercut has Creed holding on now.

1404
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,720
德拉戈擺脫了 並將奎迪逼進場角
Drago throws him off into the corner.

1405
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:51,690
- 離開場角 - 快離開場角
- Get out of that corner! - Get out of the corner!

1406
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:56,960
德拉戈把奎迪摔在了拳台上
And Drago throws Creed to the canvas.

1407
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:58,180
停停停

1408
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,180
你在幹什麼

1409
01:46:59,180 --> 01:46:59,900
你要幹什麼

1410
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:01,200
這是幹什麼呢
What's going on?

1411
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,830
上次比賽也是這樣
Shades of the first fight,

1412
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:04,930
不過這一次德拉戈稍微克制了一點
but Drago showing restraint this time.

1413
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:06,100
還行嗎
You good?

1414
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:07,200
行 沒問題
Yes, I'm good.

1415
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:08,610
趕緊幹掉他

1416
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:12,770
- 開始 - 比賽短暫中止之後 德拉戈徹底爆發了
- Box. - Drago explodes from the break.

1417
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:14,040
奎迪倒地了
And Creed is down!

1418
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,140
他沒擋住這一連串颶風般的重拳
A flurry of heavy shots!

1419
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:19,420
德拉戈的力量簡直是太驚人了
Drago's power is just incredible.

1420
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:22,220
三
Three.

1421
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:24,120
四
Four.

1422
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:26,220
等夠八秒 等夠八秒再起來
Take the eight count. Take the full eight.

1423
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,760
奎迪正趴在地上 抓緊時間調整
Creed taking his time on the canvas.

1424
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:28,920
六
Six.

1425
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:30,930
趴著別動 深呼吸
Stay down! Breathe!

1426
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:33,360
奎迪聽從了洛奇的指示 因為洛奇曾有過類似的比賽經歷
He's listening to Rocky, who has been in this situation before.

1427
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,000
八
Eight.

1428
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,500
就在讀秒結束前 奎迪站起來了
And Creed is back on his feet. Beats the count.

1429
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:37,600
- 好了嗎 - 好了 開始吧
- Ready? - Yeah, let's go.

1430
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,000
開始
Box.

1431
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,640
纏住他 別跟他打 纏住他
Tie him up. Don't fight him. Tie him up.

1432
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:43,070
德拉戈重整旗鼓 再次猛攻
Drago is right back at it.

1433
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:48,380
剛剛一個擊倒 加上最後的連續重拳
So, with the knockdown and those hard shots at the end,

1434
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:51,310
這一回合 德拉戈的贏面明顯要大於奎迪
that round clearly goes to Viktor Drago.

1435
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,950
而且能感覺到他的攻勢一波比一波猛
And you could just feel he's gaining momentum.

1436
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:55,680
這次本來就是場硬仗 對吧
You knew this was gonna be a war, right?

1437
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:57,050
你來之前就知道了
You knew that going in there.

1438
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:59,450
從現在起拼的 就是誰更想贏
From now on, it's who wants it more,

1439
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,920
誰的意志更堅定
and who's got more heart.

1440
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:01,320
第三回合

1441
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:03,550
打得好

1442
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:06,560
別讓他打垮你 你在外圍轉只能挨打
Don't let him crack you. You stay on the outside, you're gonna get hurt.

1443
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,830
近身對打才能打敗他
You stay on the inside, you'll tear him up.

1444
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:10,670
關鍵是得向他施壓
I'm telling you, it's all about pressure.

1445
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:13,740
如果想讓對方痛苦 自己得先忍受痛苦
If you wanna give pain, you gotta be willing to take the pain.

1446
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:25,110
來啊
Come on!

1447
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:30,820
很好
- Yes! - Yes!

1448
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,300
金腰帶應該是我們的

1449
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,280
可現在你要保不住它了

1450
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:37,960
第四回合 又是一個殘酷激烈的回合
Round four is another brutal display

1451
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:41,260
奎迪被動地受著德拉戈的連續重擊
as Creed takes a lot of punishment from Drago.

1452
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:45,000
德拉戈絲毫沒有放緩自己的攻勢
Drago is not slowing down.

1453
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,770
鈴響之後 還對奎迪使出了一記重拳
Landing a big shot after the bell.

1454
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,300
你們是怎麼回事
What is your problem?

1455
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,090
第五回合

1456
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:57,010
這兩位殘暴的對抗還在繼續 吉姆
The violent chess match continues, Jim.

1457
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:59,680
奎迪又一次被擊倒了
Oh, and Creed is down again.

1458
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:01,720
多尼 起來
Donnie, get up.

1459
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:05,080
德拉戈明顯佔據了上風 不過奎迪也沒想放棄
Drago clearly dominating this fight, but Creed will not give up.

1460
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:06,650
他這幾回合可是受了不少罪
He is taking a lot of punishment.

1461
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:08,250
你就貼身緊逼 看著我
You gotta stay in his face. Look at me.

1462
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:10,320
你要做的就是貼身緊逼
You gotta stay in his face.

1463
01:49:10,330 --> 01:49:13,330
一旦你等到機會 就全力出擊
And when you see an opportunity, you go after it.

1464
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:12,140
第六回合

1465
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:18,830
這就對了
There you are!

1466
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,410
德拉戈的節奏亂了
Drago is cut now.

1467
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,510
第八回合結束
As we enter round eight,

1468
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:32,610
比賽進行到這個階段 超乎我們所有人的預料
we are deeper into this fight than anyone expected.

1469
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:36,120
奎迪自知比分落後 開始逼自己發動進攻
Creed must sense he's behind. He's trying to force the action.

1470
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:40,160
很好 兒子
Yes, baby!

1471
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,700
今晚我們一路看著阿多尼斯·奎迪
What we are seeing tonight is Adonis Creed

1472
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:55,100
站上拳台正面迎擊實力非同凡響的維克托·德拉戈
standing up to the awesome power of Viktor Drago.

1473
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:57,040
他絲毫沒有退縮
He's not going anywhere.

1474
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:02,390
再把他放倒一次

1475
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:08,650
維克托看上去很累 馬克斯
Viktor Drago looks tired, Max.

1476
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:12,150
要知道之前他打職業拳賽的時候 從來不必打第四回合
Keep in mind, he's never had to go past the 4th round in a professional fight.

1477
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:17,790
- 他在幹什麼 - 扣分啊 裁判
- Hey! What was that? - Take the point, ref!

1478
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:19,220
德拉戈連出兩記重拳
And Drago drops Creed

1479
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:20,890
又讓奎迪倒在了拳台上
- with two nasty body shots. - Come on!

1480
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:23,100
- 哪有拽著人打的 - 一
- He held him and hit him. - One.

1481
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,330
維克托拽住對手攻擊 卻僥倖逃過了判罰
Viktor holding and maybe getting away with something there.

1482
01:50:26,330 --> 01:50:28,400
可能是裁判沒有看清
The ref must not have seen it.

1483
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,000
過來
Come on.

1484
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:34,210
我看洛奇·巴爾博亞得考慮是不是該認輸了 吉姆
I think Rocky Balboa has a decision to make here, Jim.

1485
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,810
他比任何人都清楚
He knows better than anyone

1486
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:39,510
三十年前他遇到同樣的情況時 是什麼樣的結局
how this same story played out three decades ago.

1487
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:41,280
多尼 跟我說話
Donnie, Donnie, talk to me.

1488
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,580
多尼
Donnie.

1489
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:43,880
你的肋骨
Your ribs?

1490
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,350
斷了嗎
You think it's broke?

1491
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:52,890
幹掉他

1492
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,830
你想怎麼辦 多尼
What do you wanna do, Donnie?

1493
01:50:58,570 --> 01:50:59,930
要我認輸嗎
You wanna call it?

1494
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,110
我想也不是
I didn't think so.

1495
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,960
上 下 上 下

1496
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,680
接下來他會窮追不捨
Now he's gonna come after you,

1497
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:15,150
攻擊你受傷的肋骨 讓它徹底斷掉
and he's gonna try to break on that rib some more.

1498
01:51:15,150 --> 01:51:16,580
但沒關係
But that's okay.

1499
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:18,250
因為你享受疼痛 你扛得住
'Cause you like the pain. You can take it.

1500
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:21,420
為什麼 因為你很強大
You know why? Because you're dangerous.

1501
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:23,720
- 我很強大 - 說得沒錯
- I'm dangerous. - That's right.

1502
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,220
還有十秒
Ten seconds out.

1503
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:44,440
現在到了第十回合的比賽
Now here we go with round ten

1504
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,810
這場比賽已經成了一場艱苦的拉鋸戰
of what has become a war of attrition.

1505
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:51,250
- 目前計分牌顯示德拉戈暫時領先 - 但奎迪 他完全沒打算認輸
Drago seemingly ahead on the scorecards, but Creed refusing to back down.

1506
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:53,250
就這麼打 多尼 很好
That's it, Donnie. Good.

1507
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:56,190
奎迪現在已經是使出了渾身的力氣
Creed using whatever he has left in the tank.

1508
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:58,020
德拉戈在集中攻擊他的身體
Drago working the body.

1509
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:59,330
纏住他
Tie him up!

1510
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:06,460
奎迪再次被擊倒在地
And down goes Creed again.

1511
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:09,170
這場比賽可能要到此為止了
And this could be the end of the fight.

1512
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,350
快認輸吧 別死撐了

1513
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:40,270
起來 多尼
Get up, D.

1514
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:55,480
沒有人能抗得住德拉戈那樣的重拳
No man should be able to fight through that beating,

1515
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:57,350
但阿多尼斯·奎迪靠意志再次站了起來 奎迪
but Adonis Creed wills himself off the canvas.

1516
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:59,150
- 你叫什麼 - 奎迪
- What's your name? - Creed.

1517
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:00,550
你叫什麼
What's your name?

1518
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:02,350
奎迪
Creed!

1519
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:07,590
開始
Box!

1520
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:10,960
阿多尼斯·奎迪知道 維克托·德拉戈是他必須跨越的障礙
Adonis Creed knows there is no way around Viktor Drago.

1521
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,660
他一定要攻克他
He has to go through him.

1522
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:15,600
重錘
Dig!

1523
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,870
重錘 重錘
Dig! Dig!

1524
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:19,500
奎迪突然像多了個馬達一樣
Creed suddenly finding another gear!

1525
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:20,510
加油
Come on!

1526
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:23,810
德拉戈有些站不穩了
Drago's on his heels.

1527
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:30,510
德拉戈被擊倒了
And down goes Drago!

1528
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:34,550
這就對了 就該這樣
That's it! That's right!

1529
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,560
拳台上的局勢瞬間扭轉了 一
What a wild turn of events.

1530
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,330
站起來

1531
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:42,460
二
Two.

1532
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:44,630
多尼 等他一起來 就乘勝追擊
Donnie, he gets up, you go after him.

1533
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:45,700
三
Three.

1534
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:48,430
四
Four.

1535
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:51,600
五
Five.

1536
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:55,340
- 六 - 德拉戈及時站起來了
- Six. - Drago beats the count.

1537
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:59,640
真不敢相信 這兩位到這一刻居然還能站得住
I can't believe either of these guys are still on their feet.

1538
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:06,150
開始
Box.

1539
01:54:10,290 --> 01:54:14,690
德拉戈在比分上應該是大幅領先 他只要不被擊倒在地
Drago seemingly so far ahead on points, he just needs to stay upright

1540
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:16,530
撐到最後就能贏
and make it to the end.

1541
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:20,160
奎通再次進攻 讓德拉戈在圍繩邊動彈不得
Here comes Creed again, driving Drago back into the ropes.

1542
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:21,770
重錘 重錘 打倒他
- Dig! Dig! Dig! - Yeah!

1543
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:26,170
加油 把他擊倒
Come on, take him down!

1544
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:28,670
加油 寶貝
Come on, baby.

1545
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,710
維克托·德拉戈被擊倒在地
And Viktor Drago is down!

1546
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:36,380
第二次了
Again!

1547
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,750
這場比賽局勢變化太大了
What a turn this fight has taken.

1548
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:51,690
奎迪已經疼得直不起腰了
Creed doubled over in pain

1549
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:54,730
而德拉戈正努力從拳台上爬起來
as Drago tries to pick himself up off the floor.

1550
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,820
站起來

1551
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:28,460
德拉戈拼盡了全力 在讀秒結束前站了起來
Drago summons the strength, manages to make the count.

1552
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:44,710
他們還在揮動看拳頭 馬克斯
They're still swinging, Max.

1553
01:55:44,710 --> 01:55:46,780
奎迪還在持續不斷地攻擊
Creed continuing to connect.

1554
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:49,620
這場面已經讓人不忍心看下去了 吉姆
And this is becoming hard to watch, Jim.

1555
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:52,050
在我看來德拉戈已經無力反抗了
I don't think Drago has anything left,

1556
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:54,460
但他就是死活不肯放棄
but he refuses to give up.

1557
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,410
好心 比賽結束
And that's it! It's over!

1558
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:23,850
老德拉戈作為教練 扔毛巾認輸了
Drago's corner throws in the towel.

1559
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:27,450
而阿多尼斯·奎迪衛冕了拳王之位
And Adonis Creed defends his title.

1560
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:29,250
也守住了名譽
Defends his name.

1561
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:31,460
更創造出了屬於自己的傳奇
Creates his own legacy.

1562
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:36,760
他依舊是手握金腰帶的世界重量級拳王
He is still the heavyweight champion of the world.

1563
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:42,300
現場的俄羅斯觀眾 此刻也都紛紛起立為這位美國拳手鼓掌喝彩
And the Russian crowd is standing and cheering for the American fighter.

1564
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,220
比安卡呢 比安
Where's B at? Where's B?

1565
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,050
慢點 慢點
Easy, easy, easy.

1566
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:04,360
讓開 大家都讓開一點 讓他透口氣
Hey, back up. Everybody back up. We need air.

1567
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:06,330
好了
Yeah.

1568
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,400
- 我們做到了 - 我們做到了
- We did it. - We did it.

1569
01:57:24,910 --> 01:57:26,400
沒關係

1570
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:29,080
沒關係

1571
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,060
- 沒關係 - 我們回家
- Let's go home. - Let's go, D.

1572
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:46,330
我沒事 媽 我沒事
I'm good, Ma. I'm good.

1573
01:57:53,510 --> 01:57:56,210
- 我做到了 - 你是做到了
- I did it. I did it. - You did it.

1574
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:57,680
大叔
Hey, Unc.

1575
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:12,690
現在是你的時代
It's your time.

1576
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,880
退後
Hey, okay, back up.

1577
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:11,700
阿波羅·奎迪

1578
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:13,120
老爸
What's up, Pops?

1579
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:21,130
我很抱歉一直沒來看你
I'm sorry it took me so long to come see you.

1580
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:29,070
我不知道跟你說什麼好
I'm not sure how this is supposed to go. Um...

1581
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:35,770
我猜你應該想知道 媽媽過得很不錯
I guess I should tell you that Mom's doing pretty good.

1582
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:38,440
你知道她很堅強
You know, she's holding up.

1583
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,710
洛奇也是
So is Rocky.

1584
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:44,000
溫哥華出租

1585
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:43,910
麻煩你了
- Thanks a lot. - Thank you.

1586
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,520
他也很堅強
He's a tough dude.

1587
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,490
我能明白你為什麼喜歡他
I can see why you liked him.

1588
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:55,090
我也明白你為什麼想跟他較量
I also see why you wanted to fight him, too.

1589
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,500
聽著
Look, um,

1590
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:09,770
我就是想來告訴你
I just came here to tell you that...

1591
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,850
我證明了自己
That I did it.

1592
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,750
但我不是為你
But I didn't do it for you.

1593
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:28,830
也不是求別人認同
Or because of them.

1594
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:34,200
我這麼做 只因為這是我的戰鬥
I did it because it was my fight.

1595
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:38,170
當我踏上那個拳台
And when I stepped into that ring,

1596
02:00:41,210 --> 02:00:42,910
我代表的不只是自己
it wasn't just about me.

1597
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,180
你好
Hello.

1598
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:51,310
你就是羅根吧
You must be Logan.

1599
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,750
對 你是誰
Yes. Who are you?

1600
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:54,750
羅根 是誰來了
Lo, who is it?

1601
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:58,590
有些事只能我們親力親為
Sometimes we think we have to do it all on our own.

1602
02:00:58,590 --> 02:00:59,990
你好 羅伯特
Hey, Robert.

1603
02:01:01,290 --> 02:01:02,660
但我們沒有去做
But we don't.

1604
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:07,060
我正好在附近辦點事
I was just around in the neighborhood, so...

1605
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:15,070
這是你爺爺
This is your grandfather.

1606
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:30,350
你長得真像你爸爸的媽媽
You look just like his mother.

1607
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,690
是啊
Yeah, I know.

1608
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:43,000
我想介紹個人給你
I wanna introduce you to somebody.

1609
02:01:53,710 --> 02:01:55,540
你想進來坐坐麼
Do you wanna come inside?

1610
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,450
好
Yeah.

1611
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:05,890
來抱一個
Give me that.

1612
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:19,700
- 那是個球麼 - 是的
- Is that a ball? - Yeah.

1613
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:21,740
- 來玩我扔你接吧 - 好
- Wanna play catch? - Yes.

1614
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,270
來吧
There you go.

1615
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,340
這位
This

1616
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:31,650
是你的孫女 阿瑪拉
is your granddaughter. Amara.

1617
02:02:31,650 --> 02:02:33,680
那位是你的爺爺
Say what's up to Pop-Pop.

1618
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:36,970
奎迪
