<i>維克托在第三回合贏得了比賽</i>

3
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:52,707
<i>什麼叫練拳擊</i>

4
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:55,447
用力點

5
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,534
來個上勾拳

6
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,012
好樣的 真棒

7
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,316
來啊 再來

8
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,404
結束了

9
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,506
一定能贏
{\fs12}Yeah. We got this.

10
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,762
今晚可是光榮的拳王之夜 羅伊
{\fs12}...here at the MGM Grand tonight, Roy.

11
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,474
你知道嗎 阿多尼斯·奎迪之前惜敗於"俊小子"堸礡P康蘭
{\fs12}And, you know, when Adonis Creed lost to "Pretty」 Ricky Conlan,

12
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,226
但他的橫空出世 引起了大家空前的好奇
{\fs12}he was really a curiosity more than anything else.

13
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,811
那真是一場壯烈的比賽
{\fs12}But that was an epic fight,

14
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,731
從那以後 他一口氣取得了六場連勝的戰績
{\fs12}and since then, he's reeled off six straight wins,

15
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,943
而今晚他又將對戰"特技演員"丹尼·惠勒
{\fs12}and tonight attempts against Danny "The Stuntman" Wheeler

17
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,696
共同競爭世界重量級拳王的寶座
{\fs12}to become the heavyweight champion of the world.

18
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,451
值得一提的是 奎迪在上次與惠勒的熱身賽中
{\fs12}It bears mentioning that Creed actually wagered his Mustang

19
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,953
把自己的福特野馬都賭輸了 羅伊
{\fs12}before their sparring session, Roy.

20
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,874
據說這輛福特野馬 今晚又被惠勒當成了賭注
{\fs12}And rumor has it that same Mustang is on the line again tonight.

21
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,252
好了 都出去吧 我們走

22
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,594
還好嗎
{\fs12}Feel good? - Mmm-hmm.

23
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,223
好 記住要一直出右拳 好嗎
{\fs12}Yeah. Remember to keep your right hand up, okay?

24
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,849
他的左拳和右拳一樣厲害
{\fs12}His left is just as strong as his right.

25
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,851
好
{\fs12}Yep. - Yeah.

26
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,197
那就好
{\fs12}Okay, good.

27
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,536
保持平常心就行 好嗎
{\fs12}It's just another fight, okay?

28
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,164
你一定能贏的
{\fs12}You got this.

29
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,135
<i>奎迪隊</i>

30
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,847
從台下到台上只有三個台階
{\fs12}You know, there's only three steps into that ring.

31
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,182
三個而已
{\fs12}Just three.

32
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,478
可今晚它們會像山一樣高不可攀
{\fs12}And tonight, it's gonna look as high as a mountain.

33
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,275
當你鑽過圍繩之後
{\fs12}And when you climb through them ropes,

34
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,736
會立刻陷入孤立無援的境地
{\fs12}it's gonna be the loneliest place in the world

35
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,989
因為站在你對面的拳手
{\fs12}because you're gonna be in there with another fighter

36
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,074
只想把你擊倒
{\fs12}who wants to take you out.

37
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,202
現在你必須問問自己
{\fs12}So now, you got to ask yourself,

38
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,372
你來這兒到底是為了不辜負別人
{\fs12}are you here to prove something to other people

39
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,293
還是為了無愧於自己
{\fs12}or prove something to yourself?

40
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,840
我想無愧於自己
{\fs12}To myself.

41
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,467
很好
{\fs12}Right.

42
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,804
現在換我來問你問題
{\fs12}Now, let me ask you something.

43
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:28,889
你問
{\fs12}What?

44
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,808
你頭髮怎麼了
{\fs12}What's with the hair?

45
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,520
我仔細梳了梳 今天可是大日子
{\fs12}I combed it. It's a special night.

46
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,232
你是不是該操心點別的 小滑頭
{\fs12}Shouldn't you be thinking about something else, wise guy?

47
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,487
好了去證明自己
{\fs12}Now, you can go prove it.

48
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,283
把你那輛野馬給贏回來
{\fs12}Now go get your Mustang back.

49
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,705
兩位拳手在第四回合真是打得難解難分
{\fs12}These guys have really been mixing it up here in the fourth.

50
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,958
目前 年輕氣盛的奎迪壓制了經驗老道的惠勒
{\fs12}So far, Creed's youth outweighing Wheeler's experience.

51
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,169
逼他後退 加油 兄弟
{\fs12}Let's go! Let's go, baby. Let's go!

52
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,547
阿多尼斯·奎迪的這場比賽最振奮人心的地方
{\fs12}Maybe the most amazing part of Adonis Creed's journey, Roy...

53
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,215
就在於他今晚的搏殺
{\fs12}Don't drop that guard! Sit.

54
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,383
是為了接過他的教練
{\fs12}...is that tonight, he fights...

55
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,551
洛奇·巴爾博亞
{\fs12}Keep your hands up!

56
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,261
和他的父親 偉大的阿波羅·奎迪
{\fs12}...for the same belt held by both his trainer, Rocky Balboa,

57
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,181
都贏過的那條金腰帶
{\fs12}and his father, the great Apollo Creed.

58
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,811
惠勒好像要發力反擊了 這一幕似曾相識 羅伊
{\fs12}Wheeler seems to be waking up. We've seen this before, Roy.

59
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,106
一旦勾起嗜血的慾望 惠勒就會興奮難擋
{\fs12}When Wheeler smells blood, he really turns it on.

60
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,031
再來 繼續再打
{\fs12}Come on back.

61
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,959
加油 多尼
{\fs12}Come on, DI

62
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,627
放在三年前 奎迪就輸定了
{\fs12}Three years ago, that's a knockout.

63
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,381
可如今惠勒的力量已經不如以前 奎迪肯定也察覺到了這點
{\fs12}Wheeler's power just isn't the same, and no doubt Creed can sense it.

64
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,676
他不行了 咬緊他
{\fs12}You got him. Stay on him!

65
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,887
奎迪是志在必得啊 現在簡直卯足了全力
{\fs12}Creed's on a mission, really pressing the issue now.

66
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,931
他揮出了一記雷霆萬鈞的左勾拳
{\fs12}And a big left hook lands flush!

67
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,935
奎迪對惠勒如影隨形 持續出擊 不躲也不停
{\fs12}Creed staying in the pocket, Max. Moving, not running.

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,396
再加把勁 出拳
{\fs12}Come on, now! Hands up! Hands up!

69
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,731
兩位拳手真的都拼盡了全力
{\fs12}These two men are really going at it.

70
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,816
幹掉他 多尼
{\fs12}Tell him, Donnie!

71
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,859
又一記左勾拳 惠勒連連後退
{\fs12}Another left hook drives Wheeler back.

72
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,986
加油 兄弟
{\fs12}Come on, baby!

73
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,240
奎迪冷不丁從空隙奡坏X一記上勾拳
{\fs12}That was a sneaky little uppercut on the inside,

74
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
惠勒受到了重創 羅伊
{\fs12}and Wheeler's hurt by that, Roy.

75
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,660
沒錯 他的腿抖得厲害
{\fs12}Yeah, that wobbled his legs pretty bad.

76
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,620
又是一記重擊 出拳 出拳
{\fs12}Another big shot! - Hold him, hold him, hold him!

77
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,414
奎迪壓制住惠勒了 馬克斯
{\fs12}Creed has him in trouble, Max.

78
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,915
惠勒正在奮力抵抗 但是
{\fs12}Wheeler's doing what he can...

79
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,837
惠勒倒下了
{\fs12}Wheeler is down!

80
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,213
惠勒倒在了拳台上
{\fs12}Wheeler has hit the canvas!

81
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,007
你就趴著吧 小子
{\fs12}Now stay there, boy!

82
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,466
我奎迪才是贏家
{\fs12}Creed taught you!

83
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,968
讓他把鑰匙還我
{\fs12}Come and give me my keys!

84
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,095
快起來
{\fs12}Get up! Come on, baby!

85
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,471
快起來 加油 兄弟
{\fs12}Get up, get up!

86
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,473
惠勒掙扎著想站起來 - 一
{\fs12}Wheeler, trying to get up. - One!

87
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,641
趴著吧  - 二
{\fs12}Stay down! - Two!

88
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,435
但不知能否趕在倒計時結束前起身
{\fs12}I don't know if he makes this count, Roy.

89
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,519
三
{\fs12}Three!

90
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,021
四
{\fs12}Four!

91
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,731
五

92
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,149
六

九
{\fs12}Nine!

96
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,239
結束了
{\fs12}That's it. That's it.

97
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,324
比賽結束了 馬克斯
{\fs12}And it's over, Max.

98
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,452
難以置信 阿多尼斯·奎迪
{\fs12}No way! Adonis Creed...

99
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,495
還我車鑰匙
{\fs12}Give me my keys!

100
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,914
他登上了世界重量級拳賽的拳王寶座
{\fs12}...is the heavyweight champion of the world.

101
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,710
你知道你成拳王了嗎
{\fs12}You know what you just did?

102
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,961
知道
{\fs12}Yeah.

103
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,088
寶貝 你知道發生什麼了嗎
{\fs12}Baby, you know what just happened?

104

知道

105
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:10,122
太棒了

106
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:11,123
太棒了

107
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,345
大家可以想想這個年輕人的出身
{\fs12}When you think of where this kid has come from,

108
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,640
以他的起點是不可能當上拳手的 羅伊
{\fs12}the most unlikely beginning for a fighter, Roy.

109
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,851
按照他的成長路徑
{\fs12}Growing up the way he did

110
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,937
他能這樣一步一步地登上拳王寶座
{\fs12}to make it to the top of boxing in this way...

111
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:22,917
<i>惠勒隊</i>

112
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,314
可以說是史無前例
{\fs12}It's unprecedented!

奎迪
{\fs12}Creed! Creed! Creed!

114
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,110
成為頭號拳王競爭者是一回事
{\fs12}It's one thing to be the number one contender.

115
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,238
真正成為拳王則完全是另一回事
{\fs12}It's a whole other thing to be champion.

116
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,995
今晚就是他稱霸拳壇 續寫拳王專奇的第一步
{\fs12}This is the first step to building a legacy of his own,

117
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,708
我已經迫不及待想看到阿多尼斯·奎迪 會有怎樣的未來
{\fs12}and I can hardly wait to see what's next for Adonis Creed.

118
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,174
這個怎麼樣
{\fs12}I mean, what do you think?

119
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,592
這真是
{\fs12}That's...

120
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,302
太漂亮了
{\fs12}That is beautiful.

121
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,595
是吧 是
{\fs12}Right? - Yeah.

122
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,679
我們得快點
{\fs12}But we got to hurry up.

123
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,389
她隨時都可能洗完澡出來的
{\fs12}I mean, she's about to get out the shower any second.

124
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,850
多尼 你之前怎麼都不告訴我呢
{\fs12}Yo, Donnie, why didn't you tell me about this before?

125
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,102
我又不確定能不能贏
{\fs12}I didn't know if I was gonna win.

126
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,770
和能不能贏有什麼關係
{\fs12}What's that got to do with it?

127
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,188
我說不好
{\fs12}I don't know.

128
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,774
好了 你教我怎麼做
{\fs12}Look, just tell me what I should do.

129
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,276
你得單膝下跪
{\fs12}You get down on one knee.

130
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,861
這一套還沒過時嗎
{\fs12}People still do that shit?

131
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,696
發短信求婚也不是不行
{\fs12}You can always send her a text.

132
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,282
拜託大叔 我是認真的 好嗎
{\fs12}Come on, Unc, I'm being serious, all right?

133
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,617
你怎麼求婚的
{\fs12}I mean, what did you say?

134
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,701
跟艾德埵w嗎 對
{\fs12}To Adrian? - Yeah.

135
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,578
那是很久前的事了
{\fs12}It was a long time ago.

136
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,790
我們去了動物園 那是下著雪的冬天
{\fs12}We were at the zoo. It was winter. It was snowing.

137
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,750
空氣非常清新
{\fs12}Everything smelled fresh.

138
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,003
有一隻老虎 背上落著一層雪花
{\fs12}There was this tiger. He had snow on its back.

139
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,340
它在遠處走來走去 然後 - 好了 我知道了
{\fs12}And he's walking in the background. - Okay, I get it. I get it.

140
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,800
你就說你怎麼求的
{\fs12}Just tell me what you said.

141
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,468
我正要說這段呢
{\fs12}Well, I was getting to that part.

142
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,636
我當時就問她
{\fs12}What I said is...

143
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,390
會不會特別反感跟我結婚
{\fs12}I asked if she would not mind marrying me very much,

144
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,060
我這麼說就等於含蓄地暗示 她是我的一切
{\fs12}which is kind of a dumb way of saying she's my world,

145
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,397
是她拯救了那個原本會墮落的我
{\fs12}and she made me better than I deserved to be.

146
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,816
你懂的
{\fs12}You know?

147

{\fs12}Listen, why don't you just turn off your brain

149
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,366
把真正的心婺僈△髡o
{\fs12}and let your heart do the talking.

00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,495
他說你知道他是誰
{\fs12}He said you'll know who he is.

263
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,376
拳王
{\fs12}Yo, champ.

264
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,671
你得跟這傢伙打 兄弟 打得他心服口服
{\fs12}You got to take that fight, man. Shut this dude up.

265
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,174
不會吧 惠勒還沒認輸嗎 還不到再跟他打的時候
{\fs12}No, Wheeler still talking shit? It's a little early for a rematch, bro.

266
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,468
電視聲開大點
{\fs12}Hey, turn the TV up.

267
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,930
拳壇歷史上的悲劇 又將兩代人扯到了一起
{\fs12}...and the tragic history that connects them.

268
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,319
是你
{\fs12}That you?

269
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,325
這些照片不錯
{\fs12}Nice pictures.

270
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,829
是都照得挺好
{\fs12}Yeah, they're okay.

271
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,917
但是堶惆S有我的
{\fs12}No pictures of me.

272
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,879
沒有 我這兒確實沒你的照片
{\fs12}No, there's no pictures of that.

273
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,216
你怎麼在費城
{\fs12}Why are you in Philly?

274
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,887
你不知道嗎
{\fs12}You don't know?

275
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:07,475
烏克蘭拳手維克托·德拉戈向阿多尼斯·奎迪宣戰 於今日現身美國費城
{\fs12}Ukrainian boxer Viktor Drago appeared today in Philadelphia

276
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,310
公開宣佈自己要挑戰
{\fs12}to issue a very public challenge

277
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,855
最近加冕的世界重量級拳王 阿多尼斯·奎迪
{\fs12}to recently crowned heavyweight champion Adonis Creed.

278
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,942
拳賽經紀人巴迪·瑪塞勒 日前為此召開了記者招待會
{\fs12}A press conference was held earlier by boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle.

279
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,365
我身邊這位 可不像丹尼·惠勒那麼弱
{\fs12}Now, this man here, he ain't no Danny Wheeler.

280
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,994
而且說實話 奎迪是在惠勒巔峰期過了三年後才贏的
{\fs12}And let's be honest, Creed fought him three years too late, anyway.

281
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,746
贏了不稀奇
{\fs12}Easy match.

282
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,124
你在這個國家備受愛戴
{\fs12}People in this country love you.

283
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,796
但在我的國家
{\fs12}But Russia,

284
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,883
德拉戈之名無可撼動
{\fs12}no one touch Drago name.

285
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,886
可是那一晚的比賽改變了一切
{\fs12}Everything changed that night.

286
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,014
你看 那件事都已經
{\fs12}Look, you know, that's like

287
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,809
已經是八百年前的事了
{\fs12}a million years ago.

288
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,270
可對我卻仿如昨日
{\fs12}Like yesterday to me.

289
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,857
你大老遠到我這兒來 就想說這個嗎
{\fs12}So, you came all the way over here to tell me that?

290
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,986
阿波羅·奎迪的兒子剛剛捧回金腰帶
{\fs12}It's no coincidence that Ivan Drago's son shows up

291
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,948
伊凡·德拉戈的兒子就出現了 這恐怕不是巧合
{\fs12}right after Apollo Creed's son claims the belt.

292
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,492
這是奎迪家對德拉戈家的復仇之戰
{\fs12}This is Creed versus Drago.

293
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,578
也是一場萬眾期待的世紀之戰
{\fs12}This is the fight the whole world wants to see.

294
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,539
阿多尼斯理應接受挑戰
{\fs12}And this is the fight he should take.

295
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,542
除非他害怕歷史會在自己身上重演
{\fs12}Unless he's afraid of history repeating itself.

296
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,045
這段歷史指的是1985年那場殘酷的比賽
{\fs12}That history being the infamous 1985 match

297
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:22,091
傳奇拳手阿波羅·奎迪在比賽中 死在了俄羅斯拳手
{\fs12}in which boxing legend Apollo Creed was killed by Russian fighter

298
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,342
伊凡·德拉戈的拳下
{\fs12}Ivan Drago.

299
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,971
而阿波羅的教練洛奇·巴爾博亞 也因未能及時叫停比賽
{\fs12}Apollo's trainer Rocky Balboa was heavily criticized

300
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,639
而受到了巨大的譴責
{\fs12}for failing to stop that fight.

301
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,183
多尼 寶貝
{\fs12}D. Baby.

302
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,895
他們就是在炒作而已
{\fs12}It's a publicity stunt.

303
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,567
這種事別放心上
{\fs12}Don't worry about that.

304
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,776
還有別忘了
{\fs12}And let's not forget,

305
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,198
後來在同一年 德拉戈又被巴博亞所擊敗 而且是在自己的家門口 俄羅斯
{\fs12}later that year, Balboa defeated Drago in his own backyard, Russia.

306
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,828
就因為你 我失去了一切
{\fs12}Because of you, I lose everything.

307
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,664
祖國
{\fs12}Country.

還有妻子
{\fs12}Wife.

310
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,802
你有沒有見過烏克蘭的流浪狗
{\fs12}You ever see stray dogs in Ukraine?

311
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,263
它們日日夜夜忍饑挨餓
{\fs12}They go for days with no food.

312
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,016
還要受人類唾棄 一無所有
{\fs12}People spit on them. They have nothing.

313
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,142
無家可歸
{\fs12}No home.

314
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,937
它們一心只想著生存 還有戰鬥
{\fs12}Only will to survive, to fight.

315
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:22,943
我有個兒子
{\fs12}I have son.

316
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,159
他只會用拳頭
{\fs12}All he knows

317
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,494
拚命
{\fs12}is this.

318
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,128
我的兒子會打敗你的徒弟
{\fs12}My son will break your boy.

319
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,881
我有點累了
{\fs12}Been a long day.

320
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,509
就說到這兒吧
{\fs12}I think we're done here.

321
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,098
我們這堨i不會讓流浪狗到處亂吠
{\fs12}Because around here we put strays away.

322
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,249
這兩張照片不錯
{\fs12}It's good picture.

323
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,470
我就猜到你會在這
{\fs12}I kind of figured you'd be here.

324
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,391
我之前不停地給你打電話 可是一直就沒有人接
{\fs12}You know, I tried calling and calling, but nobody picked up or anything.

325
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,232
你不覺得剛比完就訓練 有點操之過急嗎
{\fs12}Kind of early to be training, don't you think, after a fight?

326
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,566
我是想醒醒腦
{\fs12}Just trying to clear my head.

327
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,902
我明白了
{\fs12}I get that.

328
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,697
這反正比看心理醫生便宜
{\fs12}Cheaper than a shrink, that's for sure.

329
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,785
多尼 好了 我知道發生了什麼
{\fs12}Hey, Don, come on. I heard what's going on.

330
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,870
但是你不能讓他們擾亂你
{\fs12}But you can't let them get inside.

331
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,207
不過你的心情我也理解
{\fs12}But I know how you're feeling.

332
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,210
是嗎 - 真的 我懂
{\fs12}Oh, do you? - Yeah, I do.

333
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,965
那些恩怨都過去那麼久了 跟你一點關係都沒有
{\fs12}What happened a long time ago, that ain't got nothing to do with you.

334
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,179
聽著 那場比賽是阿波羅自己想打的 懂嗎
{\fs12}Listen, that fight is what Apollo wanted, all right?

335
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,848
雖然不該發生
{\fs12}It shouldn't have happened.

336
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,349
可這是命
{\fs12}But it did.

337
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,603
別再糾結了
{\fs12}And you got to let it go.

338
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,273
放下
{\fs12}Come on.

339
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,404
你看過維克托比賽嗎
{\fs12}You've seen him fight, though?

340
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,615
我在體育頻道和其他節目上看過
{\fs12}I've seen him on sports TV and stuff like that.

341
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,118
他很壯 可惜太嫩
{\fs12}He's big, but he's raw.

342
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,873
他可打不過你這麼老到的拳手
{\fs12}He ain't no mean machine like you are, that's for sure.

343
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:41,083
我敢肯定

344
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,791
這樣好了
{\fs12}You know what?

345
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,086
我幫你振作一下 今天你算是撞大運了
{\fs12}I'm gonna cheer you up, 'cause today's gonna be your lucky day.

346
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,047
提前給你個聖誕禮物吧
{\fs12}Christmas just came early for you,

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,174
我來親自為你扶沙袋 幸運的小子
{\fs12}'cause I'm gonna hold the bag, lucky guy.

348
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,134
不 幸運的是你 - 為什麼
{\fs12}No, you're the one who's lucky. - How's that?

349
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,552
因為我讓你有幸為我扶沙袋
{\fs12}'Cause I'm gonna let you hold the bag for me.

350
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,347
不錯 這一拳更好

{\fs12}Creed is down! And he could be badly hurt.

阿波羅倒在地上沒有反應了

情況似乎不妙

00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,699
四個嗎
{\fs12}Four?

386
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,409
五個嗎
{\fs12}Five?

387
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,831
有金腰帶不夠
{\fs12}The belt ain't enough.

388
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,959
你得有故事 能讓大眾長時間津津樂道
{\fs12}You need a narrative. Something that sticks to the ribs.

389
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,297
你父親 他就很懂
{\fs12}Your dad, he knew that.

390
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,507
我勸你還是好自為之
{\fs12}Do yourself a favor, brah,

391
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,885
趁早收手別惹禍
{\fs12}and quit while you ahead.

392
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,095
你想明哲保身
{\fs12}Self-preservation.

393
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,849
至少這點你比你老爸強
{\fs12}At least you got that over your old man.

394
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,147
是洛奇吹耳邊風攔著你吧
{\fs12}That must be Rocky whispering in your ear.

395
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,406
我是認真的
{\fs12}I'm serious.

396
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,701
她的聲音真棒
{\fs12}Amazing voice.

397
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,495
謝謝菲爾莫爾
{\fs12}Yo, thank you, Fillmore.

398
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,580
非常感謝
{\fs12}For real though, thank you.

399
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,761
你怎麼樣 小子
{\fs12}How you doing, kid?

400
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,179
我們談談吧
{\fs12}We got to talk.

401
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,975
那咱們散散步 透透氣
{\fs12}Let's take a walk and get some air.

402
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,104
好嗎 這屋埵麻I悶
{\fs12}Okay? Kind of stuffy in here.

403
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,356
你看那燈
{\fs12}Look at that light.

404
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,109
那玩意兒已經壞了好幾年了
{\fs12}That thing's been broken for a couple of years.

405
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,485
我都要煩死了
{\fs12}It's driving me crazy.

406
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,904
市政局不給修也不理我
{\fs12}City won't fix it or nothing.

407
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,699
燈亮不起來
{\fs12}What good is a light

408
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,285
那還有什麼用啊
{\fs12}that don't light, right?

409
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,746
這事挺逗 但這麼一看 也夠傻的
{\fs12}Kind of funny, but it's stupid, too.

410
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,042
我要接受挑戰
{\fs12}I got to take the fight.

411
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,174
為什麼
{\fs12}Why?

412
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,260
那兩個混蛋殺了我爸
{\fs12}These dudes killed my pops.

413
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,887
結果現在還招搖過市胡說八道
{\fs12}Now they're parading around, talking shit?

414
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,597
我不能放過他們
{\fs12}I can't let that slide.

415
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,393
我是拳王 對嗎
{\fs12}I'm the champ, right?

416
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,562
對
{\fs12}Yeah.

417
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,272
所以我別無選擇
{\fs12}So ll ain't got a choice.

418
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,356
選擇嗎
{\fs12}Choice?

419
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,110
你爸爸當年也說過這句話
{\fs12}That's the same thing your father said,

420
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,362
然後我就眼睜睜看著他死在我懷
{\fs12}and he died right here, in my hands.

421
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,365
你看看他的選擇讓你媽媽受了多少苦
{\fs12}Look what his choice put your mother through.

422
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,410
你不想這種落在比安卡頭上吧 孩子
{\fs12}You don't wanna really bring all that stuff up again, do you, kid?

423
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,494
我以為你能懂
{\fs12}I thought you would get it.

424
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,373
如果我不接受挑戰 我現在就得受著煎熬
{\fs12}If I don't take this fight, I got to live with it right now.

425
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,043
那孩子是在仇恨堛齯j的 你懂我的意思嗎
{\fs12}That kid was raised in hate, you know what I'm talking about?

426
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,919
而你不是 別去報仇
{\fs12}You weren't. Don't do it.

427
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,463
可你去了 - 那不一樣
{\fs12}But you did. - It's different.

428
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,547
哪堣ㄓ@樣
{\fs12}It was different?

429
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,216
很多地方不一樣
{\fs12}It's a lot different.

430
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,804
其實那晚跟德拉戈對打的應該是我
{\fs12}I was supposed to be in there with Drago that night

431
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,264
而不是你爸爸
{\fs12}and not your father.

432
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,683
我本來可以扔毛巾認輸
{\fs12}And I could've thrown in the towel,

433
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,727
可我沒有
{\fs12}but I didn't.

434
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,896
我活該抱憾終身
{\fs12}And I got to live with that.

435
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,231
後來我去找德拉戈報仇
{\fs12}And when I did get in that ring,

436
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,401
他的慾望摧毀了我的信念
{\fs12}that guy broke things in me

437
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,487
這輩子都無法復原
{\fs12}that ain't never been fixed.

438
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,492
這麼做不值
{\fs12}It's not worth it.

439
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,286
一點也不值
{\fs12}Not at all.

440
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,332
你為什麼想跟他打
{\fs12}Why do you wanna fight?

441
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,918
什麼意思 我剛剛都告訴你了
{\fs12}What are you talking about? I just told you why.

442
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,127
不 你沒有 多尼
{\fs12}No, you didn't, Donnie.

443
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,171
你到底為什麼想跟他打
{\fs12}Why do you wanna fight?

444
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,549
我知道他們為什麼跟你打 我知道他們父子想要什麼
{\fs12}I get why they wanna fight you. I know what they're fighting for.

445
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,675
那你呢
{\fs12}What about you?

446
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,638
聽我說 你的人生什麼都輸不起
{\fs12}Listen to me, you got everything to lose.

447
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,139
而他沒什麼可輸的
{\fs12}He's got nothing to lose.

448
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,600
如果一個拳手沒什麼可輸的 那就太可怕了
{\fs12}When a fighter ain't got nothing to lose, he's dangerous.

449
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,810
我也不是吃素的
{\fs12}I'm dangerous!

450
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,237
你覺得我打不過他
{\fs12}You think I'm gonna lose.

451
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,863
我沒這麼說
{\fs12}I didn't say that.

452
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,784
你不是說過他沒什麼經驗嗎
{\fs12}Same guy that said he ain't have enough experience.

453
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,870
太嫩 對吧 - 對
{\fs12}Raw, right? - Yeah.

454
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,082
可你還是覺得我打不過他
{\fs12}But you don't think I could beat him.

455
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,668
你是想說這個嗎 - 不
{\fs12}Is that what you're trying to say? - No.

456
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,836
不 我想說的不是這個
{\fs12}No, that's not what I'm saying.

457
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,130
我是說我不可能永遠在這兒守著你
{\fs12}I'm saying I'm not gonna be here forever.

458
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,423
你這話是什麼意思
{\fs12}And what's that supposed to mean?

459
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,550
意思就是你得想清楚 別犯傻
{\fs12}That means you got to do some smart thinking.

460
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,468
你覺得你守著我是犯傻嗎 洛奇
{\fs12}Oh, you wanna talk about smart decisions, Rock?

461
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,680
你孤零零住在這屋
{\fs12}You in this house all alone.

462
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,140
誰照顧你的 我
{\fs12}Who been taking care of you? Me.

463
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,933
我一直守著你
{\fs12}I've been here for you!

464
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,727
還有誰這麼對你
{\fs12}Who else you got?

465
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,609
聽著
{\fs12}Listen.

466
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,572
不管你支不支持 我都會應戰
{\fs12}I'm taking this fight with or without you.

467
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,419
我沒法支持你
{\fs12}It's got to be without.

468
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,754
我做不到
{\fs12}I can't do it.

469
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,381
就這樣了嗎
{\fs12}So that's it?

470
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,800
你就這麼不管我了
{\fs12}You walkin' out on me?

471
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,890
這次你倒是不用糾結要不要再認輸了
{\fs12}At least you ain't got to worry about throwing in the towel this time.

472
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,021
是啊
{\fs12}Yeah.

473
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,151
是啊
{\fs12}Yeah.

474
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,183
多尼 你還好嗎
{\fs12}D, are you okay?

475
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,309
洛奇那傢伙
{\fs12}Rocky, man.

476
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,186
洛奇怎麼
{\fs12}Rocky what?

477
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,646
他拒絕幫我備戰
{\fs12}He ain't training me for the fight.

478
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,274
等等 你要接受挑戰嗎
{\fs12}Wait, you're taking the fight?

479
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,943
我們經歷那麼多
{\fs12}All the shit that we've been through.

480
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,237
他說不管我就不管我了 簡直混蛋
{\fs12}He gonna leave me high and dry. That's bullshit!

481
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,531
他得癌癥都是我在照顧
{\fs12}I took care of him when he had cancer.

482
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,074
不然他早死了 比安
{\fs12}He could've been dead, B.

483
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,742
洛奇肯定有他的理由
{\fs12}I'm sure he has his reasons.

484
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,910
是嗎 什麼理由
{\fs12}Oh, yeah? Like what?

485
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,329
什麼理由
{\fs12}Like what?

486
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,918
我才不用他管
{\fs12}I don't need him.

487
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:28,465
<i>你不信守諾言 別人怎麼尊重你</i>

488
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:29,162
<i>麥克斯餐廳</i>

489
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,163
<i>拿出男人的樣子</i>

00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,556

00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,078

00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:34,465

497
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,848
我喜歡這
{\fs12}I love it.

498
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,516
我也是
{\fs12}Me, too.

499
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,894
我想在那間屋子 辟一個小角落 佈置工作間
{\fs12}I want just a little piece of that room for a studio.

500
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,855
沒問題 隨便佈置
{\fs12}That works. It's all you.

501
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,858
怎麼了
{\fs12}What's wrong?

502
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,569
說不清 可能是一路飛過來有點累
{\fs12}I don't know. Maybe I'm just a little tired from the flight.

503
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,653
沒事的
{\fs12}I'm okay.

504
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,863
那我們就別出去了
{\fs12}We don't have to go out.

505
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,073
不如待在家 叫個外賣
{\fs12}We can just stay in, order some food.

506
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,286
不 寶貝 你得見見你媽媽
{\fs12}Hmm. No, baby, you have to tell her.

507
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,173
你還在唱歌嗎
{\fs12}So, how's the music?

508
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,884
多尼沒告訴你嗎
{\fs12}Oh, Donnie didn't tell you?

509
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,095
多尼
{\fs12}D"

510
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,723
我忘了
{\fs12}Uh... I forgot.

511
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,934
忘了 我簽了公司
{\fs12}Oh. Yeah, I signed.

512
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,020
真的嗎
{\fs12}Hello.

513
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,689
真的 特別棒 公司也開始給我籌備發唱片了
{\fs12}Yeah, it's great. The record label really hit the ground running, too.

514
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,191
今年夏天我就要去音樂節演出了
{\fs12}I'm up for festivals this summer.

515
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,110
真是恭喜你 - 謝謝
{\fs12}Congratulations. - Thank you.

516
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,912
洛奇怎麼樣了
{\fs12}So, how's Rocky?

517
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,623
他不想過來玩玩嗎
{\fs12}He didn't wanna make the trip?

518
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,000
媽 你也知道他這個人
{\fs12}Nah, Ma, you know how he is

519
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,169
他不愛出遠門
{\fs12}with the traveling.

520
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,100
好吧 媽
{\fs12}Okay, Ma.

521
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,145
你肯定已經猜到了 不過
{\fs12}I'm sure you already guessed it, but...

522
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,230
沒錯
{\fs12}Oh, yeah.

523
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,273
我早就猜到了
{\fs12}I already know.

524
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,570
這麼愛吃鹹的
{\fs12}All the salt,

525
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,240
頭髮也亮
{\fs12}shiny hair,

526
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,118
簡直容光煥發
{\fs12}glowing skin.

527
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,163
懷孕幾個月了
{\fs12}How far along are you?

528
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,377
媽 你是以為
{\fs12}Ma, you think...

529
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,129
你以為
{\fs12}You think...

530
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,006
不是
{\fs12}No.

531
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,426
我們都還沒 不是的 這真是
{\fs12}We couldn't even... No.

532
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,927
你媽喜歡開玩笑
{\fs12}Your mamma's got jokes, okay.

533
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,221
不 我沒懷孕
{\fs12}No, I'm not.

534
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,181
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

535
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,069
結果是什麼 - 多尼 別碰
{\fs12}What's it say? - D, don't touch it.

536
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,113
我又不在乎它有沒有尿 我只想看看
{\fs12}No, I don't care if you peed on it. I just want to see...

537
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,406
我是讓你別亂動它
{\fs12}I don't want you to mess it up.

538
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,201
怎麼樣
{\fs12}What's it say?

539
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,329
有兩條藍線
{\fs12}It's two blue lines.

540
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,542
兩條藍線 是什麼意思
{\fs12}Two blue lines? What does that mean?

541
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,419
兩條藍線
{\fs12}Two blue lines.

542
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,176
老天 它可能是壞了
{\fs12}Maybe it's broke.

543
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,898
這不可能
{\fs12}That's crazy.

544
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,819
我很猶豫 多尼
{\fs12}Hell, I don't know, D.

545
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,073
寶貝 我很猶豫
{\fs12}Baby, I don't know.

546
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,956
你一直都想要孩子 對吧
{\fs12}You did say you always wanted kids, right?

547
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,333
對 可我沒想這麼早要
{\fs12}Yeah, but I didn't say so soon.

548
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,004
我不知道我
{\fs12}I don't know if I'm...

549
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,591
我們 準備好了嗎
{\fs12}If we are ready.

550
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,854
現在準備也不遲
{\fs12}Let's get ready, then.

551
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,276
對
{\fs12}Yeah.

552
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,660
她告訴家堣H了嗎
{\fs12}Did she tell her family yet?

553
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,413
她現在就和她姑媽打電話呢
{\fs12}She's, uh, on the phone with her aunt right now.

554
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,499
比安可是好姑娘
{\fs12}Oh, that Bianca's a good one.

555
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,002
她怎麼會答應嫁給你呢 我是真想不通
{\fs12}Why she agreed to marry you, I do not know.

556
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,255
其實我也想不通
{\fs12}I don't know either.

557
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,594
你們回來可真好
{\fs12}Oh, it's good to have you home.

558
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:09,806
媽
{\fs12}Ma, um...

559
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:14,686
那場比賽
{\fs12}That fight

560
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,064
你知道
{\fs12}between me

561
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,234
對手是伊凡·德拉戈的兒子
{\fs12}and Ivan Drago's son...

562
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,614
我想接受挑戰
{\fs12}I'm gonna take it.

563
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,867
好啊
{\fs12}Okay.

564
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,080
就這樣嗎
{\fs12}That's it?

565
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,332
那你還想聽我說什麼
{\fs12}What else is there to say?

566
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,750
難道你不擔心嗎
{\fs12}So, that doesn't bother you?

567
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,294
我怎麼可能不擔心
{\fs12}Oh, you think this doesn't bother me?

568
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,755
可你是成年人了
{\fs12}You're a grown man.

569
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,258
我和別人怎麼想對你來說都不重要
{\fs12}It doesn't matter what I or anyone else thinks.

570
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,261
你想跟那個人打 是你的事情
{\fs12}You wanna fight this man, that's your business.

571
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,138
你又不需要我祝福你
{\fs12}You don't need my blessings.

572
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,433
洛奇不也沒祝福你嗎
{\fs12}You clearly don't have Rocky's.

573
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,101
洛奇理解不了
{\fs12}Rocky don't get it.

574
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:57,979
死的不是他爸
{\fs12}It wasn't his dad.

575
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,108
我的人生都被改寫了
{\fs12}It changed my life.

576
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,902
還有你的人生
{\fs12}Your life.

577
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,653
你難道不想爸爸嗎
{\fs12}You're telling me you don't miss him?

578
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,738
你說什麼
{\fs12}Excuse me!

579
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,157
別把這扯到我頭上
{\fs12}Do not try to make this about me.

580
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,367
也別拿你爸爸給自己當借口
{\fs12}And don't pretend that it's about your father.

581
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,203
沒有你爸 你也成了世界拳王
{\fs12}You became the world champion without him.

582
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,122
可我好像不想當拳王
{\fs12}Then why don't I feel like it?

583
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,377
要是你爸還活 他也會告訴你 他不想當拳王
{\fs12}If your father was here, he would tell you he didn't feel like it either.

584
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,588
可他不在了
{\fs12}But he's not.

585
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,969
我只希望你能陪自己的孩子成長
{\fs12}I just hope you'll be here for your child.

586
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,394
你怎麼這麼傻
{\fs12}Why are you so stupid?

587
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,566
別鬧
{\fs12}Stop.

588
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,110
多尼 你那兩撮鬍渣撓得我癢癢
{\fs12}D, you're tickling me with that fake beard.

589
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,612
敢這麼說我鬍子
{\fs12}The disrespect.

590
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,744
給我和寶寶唱首歌
{\fs12}Why don't you sing for us?

591
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,038
不 我可不是你的點唱機
{\fs12}No, I am not your jukebox.

592
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,041
也別指望我光著腳 挺著大肚子
{\fs12}I'm not gonna be walking around here, barefoot and pregnant,

593
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,125
還給你做什麼三明治吃
{\fs12}making you sandwiches either.

594
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,462
你聽聽 不給做三明治 也不給唱歌
{\fs12}Did you hear that? No sandwiches, no singing.

595
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,966
你媽媽對咱倆真狠心
{\fs12}Your mamma just hating on us.

596
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,425
你聽見了嗎
{\fs12}Did you hear that?

597
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,973
要是寶寶隨我怎麼辦
{\fs12}What if the baby can't, D?

598
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,600
什麼隨你
{\fs12}Can't what?

599
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,602
失聰
{\fs12}Can't hear.

600
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,607
你知道這病可能遺傳吧
{\fs12}You know it can be hereditary, right?

601
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,866
一切都會好起來的
{\fs12}Everything is gonna be fine.

602
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,536
我保證
{\fs12}I promise.

603
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:47,146
<i>便利店 寵物超市</i>

604
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:56,074
<i>德爾斐拳擊學院</i>

605
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,520
這場比賽的關注度一定非常高
{\fs12}People are gonna be all over this fight.

606
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,149
你們背後可是血海深仇啊 老弟
{\fs12}It got a lot of bad history, man.

607
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,317
糾葛太多
{\fs12}Everything.

608
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,777
你老爸
{\fs12}Your dad.

609
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,112
還有你爸啊
{\fs12}And yours, too.

610
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,781
你爸當過我爸的教練
{\fs12}Don't forget that he trained him.

611
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,910
我明白你之前為什麼不教我了
{\fs12}I know why you didn't train me before.

612
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,328
我當時不夠格
{\fs12}I wasn't ready.

613
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,122
維克托夠格
{\fs12}You was right.

614
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,166
是 可這次不一樣
{\fs12}Yeah, but this is different.

615
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,462
德拉戈的兒子
{\fs12}Drago's kid...

616
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:29,839
塊頭大
{\fs12}Big.

617
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,675
速度快
{\fs12}Fast.

618
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,177
很強壯
{\fs12}Strong.

619
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,137
路子還野得很
{\fs12}Unorthodox.

620
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,933
他是個怪物 小子
{\fs12}He's a monster, boy.

621
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,314
這個人身上就沒有短板
{\fs12}It's a balanced breakfast over there.

622
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,149
你覺得你對付得了嗎
{\fs12}You think you ready for all that?

623
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,609
我必須對付他
{\fs12}I got to be.

624
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,281
你不願意幫我沒關係
{\fs12}But if you ain't gonna do it for me,

625
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,534
就當是為他們
{\fs12}at least do it for them.

626
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,916
好好考慮一下
{\fs12}Think about it.

627
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,710
就當替他們了卻遺憾
{\fs12}Beat what they couldn't beat.

628
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,922
也能洗刷平反他們的名聲
{\fs12}Change the way they were remembered.

629
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,135
抓住這個機會 我們就能改寫歷史
{\fs12}This is our chance to rewrite history.

630
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,100
我們的歷史
{\fs12}Our history.

631
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:26,412
只要我說讓你跑快點

632
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:27,676
你就跑快點

633
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:31,818
再快一點

634
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,364
他的戰績也許不多 但是相信我
{\fs12}His record might be light, but, believe me,

635
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,783
他絕對不好對付
{\fs12}he ain't no undercard.

636
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,035
你一定得聽我的
{\fs12}So, you got to be with me.

637
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,871
都聽你的
{\fs12}I'm right here.

638
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:48,835
試試吧
{\fs12}We'll see.

639
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:52,882
<i>你如此大膽 竟敢離我而去</i>

640
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,134
有他好看
{\fs12}We'll see.

641
00:43:56,728 --> 00:43:59,533
<i>我一直都在原地 從未猶疑</i>

642
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:04,758
<i>情況越來越糟</i>

643
00:44:04,783 --> 00:44:07,635
<i>天氣冰冷難耐 唯我孤注一擲</i>

644
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,596
<i>不開玩笑 我真想抽根煙 我就在你家門口</i>

645
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,989
<i>剛跟人打了一場</i>

646
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:14,984
<i>拳拳到肉 虎虎生威 精彩絕倫</i>

647
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,908
<i>誰想嘗嘗我的厲害 儘管放馬過來</i>

648

00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,910
德拉戈沿著圍繩步步為營
{\fs12}Drago's stalking him along the ropes.

777
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,246
別靠近圍繩 多尼
{\fs12}Get off the ropes, D!

778
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,082
別進角落
{\fs12}Out the corner!

779
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,877
不 多尼 離開角落
{\fs12}No, D! Out the corner, out the corner!

780
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:37,469
德拉戈猛地揮出右拳 奎迪被打得都站不穩了
{\fs12}Hard right hand by Drago, and Creed is shaken

781
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,139
至此比賽的第一回合結束
{\fs12}as the first round comes to a close.

782
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,850
許多不在現場的觀眾 可能會有點驚訝
{\fs12}I think most watching at home are a little surprised

783
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,311
因為維克托·德拉戈 在剛開場的這幾分鐘裡
{\fs12}by how impressive Viktor Drago has looked

784
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,813
表現得相令人驚艷
{\fs12}in these opening minutes of the fight.

785
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,775
兩位拳手積怨已久
{\fs12}With the history these men share,

786
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,736
小公爵光是要讓奎迪免受情緒干擾
{\fs12}Duke may have his hands full keeping Creed

787
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,988
恐怕就已經費盡心力了
{\fs12}from letting his emotions get the best of him.

788
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,531
怎麼回事 多尼
{\fs12}What you doing, D?

789
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,450
你得按照咱們的計劃來 - 我知道
{\fs12}You need to stick with the game plan. - I know, I know.

790
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,119
別靠近圍繩 調整角度 你沒掌握好角度
{\fs12}Stay off the line. Take your angles. You ain't taking your angles.

791
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,287
我知道
{\fs12}I know!

792
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,998
如果他對你出左勾拳 就得小心 你得這樣擋他啊
{\fs12}If he throws you a left hook... Come on, man, hold the phone on that.

793
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,833
怎麼擋我會不知道 - 既然你知道
{\fs12}You think I don't know that shit? - Well, if you know it,

794
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,126
那就擋啊
{\fs12}do it!

795
00:52:11,735 --> 00:52:13,108
他害怕了

796
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,735
我能看出來

797
00:52:14,737 --> 00:52:16,544
那你告訴我

798
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,784
為什麼你還沒打敗他

799
00:52:21,863 --> 00:52:22,862
把他幹掉

800
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,647
現在第二回合即將開始 觀眾席上還是一片沸騰
{\fs12}And now, as we prepare for round two, this crowd is still buzzing

801
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,942
在第一回合的對決中 德拉戈揮舞的重拳之下是深沉的敵意
{\fs12}from the vicious rally that Drago brought forth in the last minute

802
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,819
他發起的連續攻擊 竟然在最後一刻
{\fs12}of round number one.

803
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,196
清醒點 別犯傻
{\fs12}Come out smart.

804
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,114
將奎迪打得全無招架之力
{\fs12}Got Creed in serious trouble as the round came to a close.

805
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,199
開始
{\fs12}Box!

806
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,034
現在第二回合開始了
{\fs12}And now, round two begins.

807
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,080
德拉戈一上來就發動了猛烈進攻 絲毫沒有遲疑
{\fs12}And Drago comes out throwing, wasting no time.

808
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,127
奎迪又被逼退到場邊 別靠近圍繩
{\fs12}Get off the ropes! - And Creed is backed

809
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,339
他試圖躲開對方的強力攻擊
{\fs12}into the ropes, trying to avoid those power shots.

810
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,093
該死
{\fs12}Damn.

811
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,011
場上局勢迅速進入白熱化
{\fs12}Things just got ugly fast.

812
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,976
德拉戈又是一記強勁的右勾拳 奎迪現在真有大麻煩了
{\fs12}And another hard right hand shot, and Creed is in big trouble now.

813
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,396
腳下別停 多尼
{\fs12}Keep moving, Donnie.

814
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,820
這一記右勾拳打得奎迪雙腿發軟
{\fs12}A massive right hand sends Creed reeling.

815
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,905
他在重新調整步調
{\fs12}He tries to regain his footing.

816
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,532
再欠試圖回擊
{\fs12}Creed trying to answer back.

817
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,661
又一記結實的勾拳 打得奎迪翻出了圍繩
{\fs12}And now a huge hook sends Creed flying through the ropes!

818
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,871
挺住
{\fs12}Come on, kid.

819
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,212
二
{\fs12}Two!

820
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,422
三
{\fs12}Three!

821
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,548
四
{\fs12}Four!

822
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,633
五 六
{\fs12}Five! Six!

823
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,968
很好
{\fs12}That's it, that's it, that's it.

824
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,177
奎迪
{\fs12}Creed! Creed!

825
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,054
你還好嗎 還好
{\fs12}You okay? - Yeah.

826
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,808
開始
{\fs12}Box!

827
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,892
現在奎迪必須找到
{\fs12}Creed needs something

828
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,394
扭轉戰局的辦法
{\fs12}to try to turn this fight around.

829
00:53:50,419 --> 00:53:51,487
把他幹掉

830
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,564
德拉戈的重拳持續來襲
{\fs12}Drago just keeps coming.

831
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,108
奎迪左肋又受到重擊
{\fs12}What a big rib shot!

832
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,651
媽的
{\fs12}Shit.

833
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,653
連續兩記右勾拳挾雷霆之力 打在奎迪的胸腔
{\fs12}Those were two tremendous right hands to the rib cage.

834
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,281
這沉重的悶響 都能傳到最後一排觀眾的耳朵
{\fs12}You could've heard that one in the nosebleed seats.

835
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,833
奎迪的痛苦顯而易見 但他還是盡力爬了起來
{\fs12}Creed clearly in pain, as he finds a way to his feet.

836
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,293
他並不打算放棄
{\fs12}Not ready to give up yet.

837
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,670
可怎麼說呢 情況不妙啊 吉姆
{\fs12}I don't know. This is getting dangerous, Jim.

838
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,675
你還好嗎 靠近我
{\fs12}Okay! Come to me!

839
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,011
拜利斯裁判讓雙方繼續比賽
{\fs12}And now, Bayless is gonna let him go again.

840
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,095
準備好
{\fs12}Ready?

841
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,680
開始
{\fs12}Box!

842
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,516
奎迪掙扎著離開了角落
{\fs12}He comes barreling out of the corner.

843
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,143
一記右勾拳
{\fs12}Huge right hook!

844
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,811
德拉戈想速戰速決
{\fs12}Drago trying to end it.

845
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,231
奎迪在結束鈴響之前終於又揮出一拳
{\fs12}And Creed delivers a big right hand at the bell.

846
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,691
退後
{\fs12}Get back! Get back to your corner!

847
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,152
拜利斯攔住了德拉戈 德拉戈好像有些受挫
{\fs12}Bayless restraining Drago, seemingly frustrated...

848
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,278
遵守我的命令
{\fs12}Obey my commands.

849
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,447
畢竟差一點就結束這一回合了
{\fs12}...as he was close to finishing the fight.

850
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,201
你得趕緊拿出本事來 不然我就得叫停比賽了
{\fs12}You got to show me something. If not, I'm gonna stop it.

851
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,538
你還能打嗎
{\fs12}Can you fight?

852
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,290
我能打 能打
{\fs12}Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

853
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,834
你不能打了 我去叫停比賽
{\fs12}Hell no. I'm calling this fight.

854
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,085
兄弟 不要叫停
{\fs12}Nigga, don't call this shit.

855
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,087
兄弟 沒必要求別人認同你
{\fs12}You ain't got to prove shit to nobody.

856
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,298
你看看 你肋骨可能都斷了
{\fs12}Look at you. Your ribs look like they broke.

857
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,885
別叫停比賽
{\fs12}You can't call this fight.

858
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,359
他讓你成了個笑話

859
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:12,673
這就是這些人全都看不起我們的原因

860
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,711
這也是你媽拋棄我們的原因

861
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:18,932
就是這樣

862
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,115
把我的護齒拿來
{\fs12}Hand me my mouthpiece.

863
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,912
把護齒拿來
{\fs12}My mouthpiece.

864
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,465
別打了
{\fs12}Don't do it.

865
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,510
進入第三回合
{\fs12}Now, as we go to round three,

866
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,263
阿多尼斯·奎迪已經被打得精疲力盡 身受重傷
{\fs12}Adonis Creed has been beaten up and bloodied

867
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,682
德拉戈連續不斷的重拳出擊
{\fs12}by an avalanche of power shots

868
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,976
在前兩個回合讓他吃盡了苦頭
{\fs12}from Viktor Drago in the first two rounds.

869
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,854
我們看看阿多尼斯·奎迪還剩多少能耐
{\fs12}And we'll see how much Adonis Creed has left now,

870
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,313
他掙扎著想活下去 繼續戰鬥
{\fs12}as he tries to stay alive in the fight.

871
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,940
不要再打了
{\fs12}Stop the fight.

872
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,775
德拉戈強悍的臂膀虎虎生威
{\fs12}Dangerous swings from Drago

873
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,486
奎迪正在拚命抵擋對方的攻擊
{\fs12}as Creed desperately tries to hold him off.

874
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,864
德拉戈繼續對奎迪的身體發動猛烈攻擊
{\fs12}Drago's still putting huge pressure on the body.

875
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,408
搞什麼 快還擊啊
{\fs12}Come on, stop the fight!

876
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,871
德拉戈又揮出一記重拳 奎迪似乎已經撐不住了
{\fs12}And another shot by Drago! Creed seemingly on his last legs!

877
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,581
可德拉戈未曾停手 反擊 多尼
{\fs12}Drago on the attack. - Come on, D!

878
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,794
奎迪的胸腔受到了致命的一擊
{\fs12}Oh, and with a devastating shot to the rib cage.

879
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,004
停止比賽
{\fs12}Stop! Stop!

880
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:01,084
德拉戈應該被取消資格 至少看起來是這樣
{\fs12}This is an obvious disqualification, or so it would appear

881
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,128
因為他最後揮出那一拳時
{\fs12}because Creed was fully down

882
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,255
奎迪已經倒地毫無還手之力了
{\fs12}at the moment that Drago landed that last shot.

883
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,840
你這個混蛋 不
{\fs12}No! - You wanna kill somebody?

884
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,258
不行 不行
{\fs12}No way, baby. No! - Easy, easy!

885
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,928
不
{\fs12}No. No, no, no! - Come on.

886
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,888
不 冷靜點
{\fs12}No! Just relax.

887
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,448
整個體育場都陷入了沉默
{\fs12}This arena is completely silent

888
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,034
觀眾們都在等待
{\fs12}as the audience waits to see

889
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,788
醫護人員會為年輕的阿多尼斯·奎迪 診斷出怎樣的傷勢
{\fs12}what will be the condition of young Adonis Creed.

890
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:03,271
除了眼眶骨破裂 還斷了兩根肋骨 腦震盪程度三級
{\fs12}Cracked orbital bone, two cracked ribs, grade-3 concussion,

891
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,024
腎臟破裂 以及多處挫傷
{\fs12}ruptured kidney, numerous contusions.

892
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,861
腎臟破裂會不會
{\fs12}A ruptured kidney, is that--

893
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,697
這些傷 好好休息都能痊癒
{\fs12}His injuries will heal with rest and time,

894
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,823
包括腎臟
{\fs12}including the kidney.

895
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,242
現在來看 沒必要動手術
{\fs12}Now, we shouldn't have to resort to surgery,

896
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,786
不過得留院觀察 至少48小時 以防傷勢惡化
{\fs12}but we will need to keep him here for at least 48 hours, as a precaution.

897
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:22,040
還有 他現在麻醉勁兒還沒過去 不過再過一會兒肯定會醒的
{\fs12}Now he's still numb from the morphine, but he'll certainly feel it later.

898
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,710
好的 你還好嗎
{\fs12}Okay. - You okay?

899
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,295
還好 我坐一會兒就行
{\fs12}Fine, I just got to sit.

900
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,216
要是你感覺不對
{\fs12}If you're expecting...

901
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,384
不 我沒事
{\fs12}No, I'm fine.

902
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,721
不 我說真的 別太擔心 好嗎
{\fs12}No, no, seriously. Take it easy, okay?

903
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,807
打擾一下 尤厄爾醫生
{\fs12}Excuse me, Dr. Ewell.

904
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,436
有人找你 這邊請
{\fs12}You have a visitor. Right this way.

我很抱歉事情變成這樣
{\fs12}Listen, I'm so sorry everything went...

907
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,574
我就該守著他
{\fs12}I should've been there.

908
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,909
真的對不起
{\fs12}I'm so sorry.

909

真的
{\fs12}I am.

910
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,788
我也很懊悔
{\fs12}Me, too.

911
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,623
我能看看他嗎
{\fs12}Is it okay if I see him?

912
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,754
對我們來說有區別嗎 當時我們都看見了
{\fs12}What difference do it make to us? We saw what happened.

913
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,338
裁判和組委會公正裁決就行
{\fs12}They doing what they supposed to be doing.

914
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,758
這我不管
{\fs12}I don't care.

915
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,302
對
{\fs12}Right. Okay.

916
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,720
好 知道了
{\fs12}Got it.

917
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,316
理事會不打算對裁判的裁決提出異議
{\fs12}WBC's not gonna contest the referee's decision,

918
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,236
所以維克托維持判罰 取消比賽資格
{\fs12}so Viktor remains disqualified.

919
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:35,864
但至少

{\fs12}You showed a ton of heart. I mean, there's no doubt about it.

928

{\fs12}Showed a ton of heart. - Heart?

{\fs12}Oh, it's okay. It's all right. - No, you guys got to work it out.

932
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,564
這場比賽我根本必輸無疑 對嗎
{\fs12}I lost the fight before it even started, right?

933
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,359

我理解

畢竟他很受煎熬
{\fs12}'Cause he's going through a lot.

而且 非常游離
{\fs12}and disconnected.

01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,220
她挺好 挺好
{\fs12}She's good. She's good.

1037
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,305
好
{\fs12}Good, good, good.

1038
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,268
其實我一直很想聯繫你 兄弟
{\fs12}Listen, man, I've been meaning to hit you up, though.

1039
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,604
理事會想知道我們下一場比賽跟誰打
{\fs12}Commissioner wanna know who we plan to fight next.

1040
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,107
就算不跟德拉戈打
{\fs12}You ain't got to fight Drago,

1041
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,401
你也得跟別人打
{\fs12}but you got to fight someone.

1042
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,653
你得守住金腰帶
{\fs12}You got to defend the belt.

1043
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,698
不然它就要被收回去了
{\fs12}Otherwise, it's gonna be vacated.

1044
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,454
你知道 我能幫你 選個好打一點的對手
{\fs12}I could set up a little, you know, tune-up fight, kind of.

1045
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:57,378
算了 這樣吧
{\fs12}No. You know what, man?

1046
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,588
你現在還是別操心這些事了
{\fs12}Don't worry about none of that right now.

1047
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,215
就進來玩會兒吧
{\fs12}Listen, just come on inside.

1048
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,384
打打沙包 熱熱身
{\fs12}Hit the bag, man, warm up.

1049
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,720
好
{\fs12}Yeah.

1050
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:09,015
我先去拿裝備 然後再進去找你
{\fs12}Yeah, I'm gonna grab my stuff, and I'm gonna meet you in there.

1051
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,269
好吧 兄弟
{\fs12}All right, man.

1052
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,198
用全身的重量出拳
{\fs12}Put your body weight into that glove.

1053
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,200
這就對了 上前一步
{\fs12}There you go. Lean in it.

1054
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,464
是啊 我都給你打了無數個電話了
{\fs12}Yeah, I called you, like, a thousand times.

1055
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,509
是 我家燈壞了
{\fs12}Yeah, it's about the light.

1056
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,803
壞了多久啊
{\fs12}How long?

1057
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,347
仔細算算 有好幾年了吧
{\fs12}You want to be specific? Couple years.

1058
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,598
對
{\fs12}Yeah.

1059
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:53,559
只是擰個燈泡而已 用得了幾個人
{\fs12}I mean, how many guys does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1060
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:56,979
我可沒開玩笑
{\fs12}I'm not joking.

1061
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:58,748
<i>瑪麗·安·奎迪寄
洛奇·巴爾博亞收</i>

1062
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,316

01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:14,057
<i>他仍然需要你
瑪麗·安</i>

1066
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:42,859
媽
{\fs12}Hey, Ma.

1067
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,028
媽
{\fs12}Ma.

1068
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:00,751
媽媽
{\fs12}Hey, Ma.

1069
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:05,965
最近好嗎 小子
{\fs12}How you doing, kid?

1070
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,135
你過來幹什麼
{\fs12}What are you doing here?

1071
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:10,595
希望你別介意
{\fs12}I hope you don't mind,

1072
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:14,307
是你媽媽請我過來的 因為她非常擔心你
{\fs12}your mom asked if I would come out 'cause she's worried about you.

1073
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:18,811
我也是
{\fs12}I am, too.

1074
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,813
我很好
{\fs12}I'm good.

1075
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,859
你不用大老遠過來一趟
{\fs12}You didn't have to come all this way.

1076
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,193
我坐火車來的
{\fs12}By train.

1077
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,572
在車上待了三天
{\fs12}Three days on a train.

1078
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,034
也挺好 你知道 我有思考的時間了
{\fs12}It's all right, you know, gives you time to think.

1079
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,538
可以看著一處處風景 像明信片一樣從窗外閃過
{\fs12}And you watch all these places whipping by the windows like postcards.

1080
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,498
也是一種不錯的經歷
{\fs12}It's quite an experience.

1081
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,834
是 你開心就好
{\fs12}Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

1082
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,586
是 真挺好
{\fs12}Yeah, it was nice.

1083
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,380
這個房間太棒了
{\fs12}This is wonderful.

1084
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:49,759
這兒怎麼能有這麼多的獎盃呢
{\fs12}How you have all this out here.

1085
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,678
你也能有這麼多獎盃
{\fs12}You could have the same.

1086
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,348
是嗎 我可沒有自信
{\fs12}Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

1087
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,100
我說的不只是榮譽
{\fs12}I mean, not just the shiny stuff,

1088
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,353
有些東西更有價值
{\fs12}but the better stuff.

1089
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,814
比如更好的人生
{\fs12}Have a better life.

1090
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,278
做更好的人
{\fs12}Be a better man.

1091
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,867
知道嗎 我其實一直在想 你之前質問我說
{\fs12}You know, I was thinking about what you were saying about

1092
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:18,579
我是不是覺得留在原地守著你就是在犯傻
{\fs12}what smart decisions have I made lately.

1093
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,126
但沒想出個結果
{\fs12}Couldn't think of many.

1094
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:29,966
跟你說我兒子的兒子 就是我的親孫子
{\fs12}You know, I wasn't even there when my son's son,

1095
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,302
他出生時
{\fs12}my grandson,

1096
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,262
我沒去
{\fs12}was born.

1097
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:40,559
他現在可能都已經長這麼高了
{\fs12}I mean, he's like that tall now probably.

1098
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,396
我卻還不認識他 他也不認識我
{\fs12}I don't even know him. He doesn't know me.

1099
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,401
真的很可悲
{\fs12}It's pathetic.

1100
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,445
那幹嗎不給他
{\fs12}Well, why won't you just

1101
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,198
打電話
{\fs12}call him?

1102
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,493
設那麼容易 你懂嗎
{\fs12}It ain't that easy, you know...

1103
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:00,997
聽著
{\fs12}Listen,

1104
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:04,667
我不希望你重蹈覆轍 犯我犯過的錯
{\fs12}I don't want you making the same mistakes I made.

1105
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,211
你懂我意思嗎
{\fs12}You know what I mean?

1106
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,008
所以你要問問你自己
{\fs12}So, you got to ask yourself,

1107
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,136
到底什麼東西才是有價值的
{\fs12}what's the valuable stuff?

1108
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,930
我以前也問過你類似的問題
{\fs12}It's like I asked you before.

1109
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,350
你一路奮戰到底是為了什麼
{\fs12}What were you really fighting for?

1110
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:24,979
我之前很怕
{\fs12}I was afraid.

1111
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,734
榮譽
{\fs12}Of this.

1112
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,697
怕別人的期待
{\fs12}Expectations.

1113
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,199
怕當拳王
{\fs12}Being the champ.

1114
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,705
我怕我自己達不到爸爸的高度
{\fs12}I was scared I couldn't do what he couldn't.

1115
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,500
挺奇怪的
{\fs12}It's weird.

1116
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:51,130
我曾覺得他是我的一部分
{\fs12}I used to feel like he was a part of me.

1117
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,925
現在我卻聽不到他的召喚了
{\fs12}Now I can't hear him, or that thing,

1118
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,845
我聽不到他讓我上拳台奮戰
{\fs12}that thing that tells me to get in the ring.

1119
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,931
要腳下不停 一直舉著拳頭
{\fs12}Move my feet, keep my hands up.

1120
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,267
打倒所有阻擋我的東西
{\fs12}Hit anything that gets in my way.

1121
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,523
我再也聽不到了
{\fs12}I can't hear it anymore.

1122
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,617
我都不知道我怎麼輸的
{\fs12}I don't even know how I lost.

1123
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,744
你這麼想就不對
{\fs12}Your mind wasn't right.

1124
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:28,167
其實你天生就不適合走爸爸這樣傳奇的路線
{\fs12}And your natural style just won't work with a guy that big.

1125
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,511
那我更適合你的路線嗎
{\fs12}You saying yours was better?

1126
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,180
我贏過 不是嗎
{\fs12}I won, didn't I?

1127
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:50,856
見到你真好 我也很開心見到你
{\fs12}Good seeing you, Unc. - Great to see you, too.

1128
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:53,025
我之前跟你媽媽仔細聊過一陣 她說
{\fs12}I was talking with your mother,

1129
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:58,489
你給你的孩子起了個名字叫做阿
{\fs12}and she says you came up with this name for the child.

1130
01:16:58,656 --> 01:16:59,865
阿瑪拉
{\fs12}Amara. - Amara.

1131
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,033
是 好
{\fs12}Yeah. - Yeah.

1132
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,284
有什麼問題嗎
{\fs12}Why, what's wrong with that?

1133
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:05,412
不 沒事 這名字很好聽 就是有點不好念
{\fs12}No, it's a beautiful name, but it's kind of complicated.

1134
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:07,039
為什麼不起一個能讓人
{\fs12}Why don't you think about something,

1135
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,291
至少能讓我念得順口點的
{\fs12}at least I would, a little simpler to say,

1136
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,628
比如貝姬或者凱特之類的
{\fs12}like "Becky" or "Cate," something like that.

1137
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,838
凱特·奎迪
{\fs12}Cate Creed?

1138
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,923
凱特·奎迪 雙C開頭 挺好記
{\fs12}Cate Creed. Two "C's." Easy to remember.

1139
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,716
你知道黑人不起這種名字吧
{\fs12}You do know she's gonna be black, right?

1140
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,927
對啊 我給忘了
{\fs12}Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1141
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,596
好吧
{\fs12}Okay.

1142
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,349
喂 媽 好吧
{\fs12}Hey, Ma. - Yeah.

1143
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,644
等等 現在嗎
{\fs12}Wait, right now?

1144
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,939
放鬆點 好的
{\fs12}Relax. - Okay.

1145
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:34,066
什麼事都不會有
{\fs12}Everything's gonna be fine. - Mmm-hmm.

1146
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,611
你就是到這堥茬郎o的 懂嗎 你就做這個
{\fs12}You just got to be there for her, okay? That's your job.

1147
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:38,779
我明白
{\fs12}I got you, I got you.

1148
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,322
你記好
{\fs12}And remember-- - Yeah.

1149
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,284

{\fs12}Today is gonna be the best day of your life. Right here.

{\fs12}Best day of your life.

1152

我要有孩子了 我感覺跟我有孩子了似的
{\fs12}I'm having a baby. - I feel like I'm having a baby.

1153

1159

01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,122
巴爾博亞先生
{\fs12}Mr. Balboa?

1163
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,375
孩子生了{\fs12}Mmm. - She's here.

1164
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,669
那太好了
{\fs12}Oh, that's great.

1165
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,591
這真是 真是天大的好消息
{\fs12}That's absolutely good.

1166
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,760
真的是棒極了
{\fs12}That's fantastic.

1167
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,480
大叔 跟你的教女打個招呼
{\fs12}Hey, Unc, say hi to your goddaughter.

1168
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,857
讓我做教父真榮幸
{\fs12}Wow. That's quite an honor.

1169
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,194
來 你看她
{\fs12}Let me see you. - Here she is.

1170
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,990
你好啊 小美人
{\fs12}Hey, hello, beautiful.

1171
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,284
對了 護士
{\fs12}So, nurse...

1172
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,622
檢查什麼時候做
{\fs12}...what about the test?

1173
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,917
你們先別急
{\fs12}Relax for now.

1174
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:00,796
聽性腦幹反應的檢查 等比安卡和阿瑪拉都休息好了就會安排
{\fs12}We'll run an auditory exam as soon as you and Amara get some rest.

1175
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,925
沒關係 寶貝
{\fs12}It's okay, babe.

1176
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,304
幸好她長得像你
{\fs12}Thank God she looks like you.

1177
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,805
可不是嗎
{\fs12}Yeah, right.

1178
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,271
這檢查會不會讓她不舒服
{\fs12}So, is she gonna feel anything?

1179
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,024
不會 這是無痛檢查 保證不疼
{\fs12}No, it's painless. I promise.

1180
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,860
好了 人都就位了
{\fs12}Okay. Now that they're in place,

1181
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:25,571
現在我們要做的就是 給她一些短促的聲音刺激
{\fs12}what we're gonna do is give her a series of click stimuli

1182
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,197
音量大概有三十五分貝
{\fs12}around 35 decibels

1183
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,366
以檢查她的神經系統反應
{\fs12}and check her neural responses.

1184
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,701
聲音大不大
{\fs12}Is that loud?

1185
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,786
在正常音頻範圍內
{\fs12}Normal auditory range.

1186
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,081
好了
{\fs12}Okay.

1187
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:37,958
<i>阿瑪拉·奎迪 聽性腦幹反應測試</i>
那就開始
{\fs12}Here we go.

1188
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,338
我們具體要看什麼
{\fs12}So what exactly are we looking for?

1189
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,256
讀數 看棘波
{\fs12}A reading. Spikes.

1190
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:18,832
好吧 目前看不到 有任何棘波之類的波形
{\fs12}So, we're not seeing any waves or spikes, uh,

1191
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,836
因為孩子有家族病史 擔心也是很正常的
{\fs12}and given your family history, there is some cause for concern.

1192
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,130
不過現在下結論太早
{\fs12}However, it is very early...

1193
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,575
醫生說還得做檢查
{\fs12}They're gonna run some more tests.

1194
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:58,414
下結論太早了 有時候會有誤診的
{\fs12}They said it's early, and, uh, sometimes they get false reads.

1195
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,878
我問你一件事
{\fs12}Let me ask you something.

1196
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,133
如果真確診了呢
{\fs12}What if it ain't okay?

1197
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:11,760
我不能這麼想
{\fs12}I can't think like that.

1198
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,305
得想 不然
{\fs12}You got to, I mean,

1199
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,517
真有事該怎麼辦
{\fs12}how you gonna handle it?

1200
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,525
我不願意想
{\fs12}I don't wanna go there.

1201
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:28,652
你會愛她嗎
{\fs12}You gonna love her?

1202
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,239
你怎麼問得出這種話 洛奇
{\fs12}How you gonna ask me a question like that, Rock?

1203
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,491
我會 我一定會愛她 那就好
{\fs12}Yeah, I'm gonna love her. - Good.

1204
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,453
阿瑪拉不會覺得自己有缺陷 所以
{\fs12}'Cause she ain't feeling sorry for herself,

1205
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:39,913
你也不該這麼覺得
{\fs12}and you shouldn't either.

1206
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:52,134
這是什麼
{\fs12}You got a little...

1207
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,138
拳擊手套
{\fs12}Oh, it's boxing gloves.

1208
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,932
是吧 是
{\fs12}You got it? - Yeah.

1209
01:22:59,012 --> 01:23:01,679
<i>奎迪</i>

1210
01:23:05,061 --> 01:23:07,611
<i>恭喜
巴迪·瑪塞勒</i>

1211
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,444
是《晚安 月亮》 這書我很喜歡
{\fs12}Goodnight Moon. I love that book.

1212
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,654
誰送的 寶貝
{\fs12}Who's that from, babe?

1213
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:17,784
被認為最強拳壇新人的維克挑德拉戈
{\fs12}The unanimous number one contender Viktor Drago

1214
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:20,078
在他父親的故鄉俄羅斯
{\fs12}has been met with open arms back in Russia,

1215
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,164
受到了熱情的歡迎 可謂好事一樁
{\fs12}his father's home, which is nice.

1216
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:25,626
不過現在所有人最關心的一件事是 奎迪哪兒去了
{\fs12}But the question on everyone's mind is, "Where is Creed?」

1217
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:29,505
如果他再不快點選出比賽對手 就有被取消拳王稱號的危險
{\fs12}If he doesn't choose an opponent soon, he risks forfeiting the title

1218
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,883
而我想 他恐怕會無法承受這樣的打擊
{\fs12}and personally, I can't imagine him being able to live with that.

1219
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,762
怎麼了
{\fs12}You good?

1220
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,307
沒事 總算把她哄睡了
{\fs12}Yeah. Finally got her to settle.

1221
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,186
我得出去一趟 辦點事情
{\fs12}Hey, I need to get out of the house.

1222
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,064
我本來得去工作室的
{\fs12}I was gonna go over to the studio.

1223
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,650
我回來之前你能照看她嗎
{\fs12}You mind watching her until I get back?

1224
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,361
能 當然能
{\fs12}Yeah, of course.

1225
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,196
好
{\fs12}Cool.

1226
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,533
好啦 好啦
{\fs12}Okay, okay.

1227
01:23:58,242 --> 01:23:59,243
好的
{\fs12}Yeah.

1228
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:09,336
還好嗎
{\fs12}You okay?

1229

{\fs12}Okay.

1231
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:16,635
拜拜
{\fs12}Bye.

{\fs12}Baby, please.

1235
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,909
你餓了 對不對 你餓了 沒關係
{\fs12}Hey, you hungry, right? Hey, baby, you hungry?

1236

媽 聽著
{\fs12}Hey, Ma. Listen, listen.

1238
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,050
阿瑪拉一直在哭 你能不能告訴我
{\fs12}She won't stop crying. Can you just tell me how to...

1239
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,011
告訴我怎麼能讓她不哭
{\fs12}Can you tell me how to make her stop crying?

1240
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,221
你聽到就給我回電 好嗎
{\fs12}Call me back when you get this message, okay?

1241
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,714
你怎麼啦 乖女兒
{\fs12}Hey, what's up, baby girl?

1242

{\fs12}Hey, no.

1243
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,218
沒事的 寶貝
{\fs12}It's okay, baby. No, no.

1244
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,596
別哭 別再哭了
{\fs12}No, don't cry. No, not again, please.

1245
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,348
求你了
{\fs12}Please.

1246
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,183
你看
{\fs12}No, look, look, look.

1247
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:48,935
看見了嗎
{\fs12}You see that?

1248
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:50,479
看這兒
{\fs12}Look, look, look.

1249
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:52,898
看這兒
{\fs12}Look.

1250
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:09,373
我在這兒呢
{\fs12}I'm right here.

1251
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:00,298
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

1252
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:03,301
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

1253
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,345
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

1254
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,392
別哭 來抱抱
{\fs12}Hey. No, no, there you go.

1255
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,062
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

1256
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,775
最近爸爸表現很糟糕 我知道
{\fs12}Mmm-hmm. Daddy's being a bitch, I know.

1257
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:40,839
嗨
{\fs12}Hi.

1258
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:43,925
她怎麼樣
{\fs12}How'd you do?

1259
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,599
她非常堅強
{\fs12}She's a fighter.

1260
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:55,854
她爸爸一樣
{\fs12}Just like her dad.

1261
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:01,193
也跟她媽媽一樣
{\fs12}Just like her mom, too.

1262
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,871
我得跟他再打一次
{\fs12}I have to fight him again.

1263
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,833
我不想做你的絆腳石
{\fs12}I don't wanna be that person to stop you.

1264
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:20,337
但我也不想最後和你媽媽一樣 孤獨
{\fs12}But I don't wanna end up like your mom, alone.

1265
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:22,798
我明白
{\fs12}I feel you.

1266
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:23,882
是嗎
{\fs12}Do you?

1267
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,804
我們都已經有孩子了 多尼
{\fs12}And it's not just us anymore, D.

1268
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:33,183
我知道再去自討苦吃一次聽起來很瘋狂
{\fs12}I know it sounds crazy doing all this all over again.

1269
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:37,562
但我不會被輕易擊潰
{\fs12}But this won't be the end of me.

1270
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:39,022
你也不會
{\fs12}Or you.

1271
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,775
絕對不會 因為我們一條心
{\fs12}It can't be, 'cause we a team.

1272
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:44,277
上次你擅自應戰 就沒跟我一條心
{\fs12}We weren't a team when you took the fight the last time.

1273
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:49,241
你說得對
{\fs12}You right.

1274
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,493
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

1275
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,623
我不該讓你受這份罪
{\fs12}I shouldn't have put you through that.

1276
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,208
那你何苦呢
{\fs12}Then why?

1277
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,502
何苦還要打
{\fs12}Why do it again?

1278
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,005
你到底要證明什麼
{\fs12}What do you have to prove?

1279
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,173
跟證明什麼無關
{\fs12}It's not about that.

1280
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:10,095
而是人一旦放棄熱愛的事業 就會失去自己的價值
{\fs12}You wouldn't be any good to anybody if you didn't do what you love.

1281
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,057
會連活都活不下去 對嗎
{\fs12}You wouldn't be able to breathe, right?

1282
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:19,145
所以如果不能好好把這件事做個了斷 那我以後就算廢了
{\fs12}Well, I wouldn't be any good to anybody if I don't handle this the right way.

1283
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,277
我需要你的支持
{\fs12}But I need you.

1284
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:28,488
我也捨不得女兒
{\fs12}Both of you.

1285
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,082
我一定會贏
{\fs12}I'll beat him.

1286
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,549
你只能贏
{\fs12}You better.

1287
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,346
這件事你必須好好考慮清楚
{\fs12}You got to think about this real hard.

1288
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,933
你現在可有家人需要照顧
{\fs12}You got people that need you now.

1289
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:59,394
正因為這樣我才更不能輸
{\fs12}That's exactly why I can't lose.

1290
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,230
巴迪說要比只能在俄羅斯比
{\fs12}Buddy said the fight has to be in Russia.

1291
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,107
不然就別比
{\fs12}Take it or leave it.

1292
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:10,655
俄羅斯
{\fs12}Russia?

1293
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,073
他們的地盤
{\fs12}On their turf.

1294
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,034
那就去俄羅斯
{\fs12}So Russia it is.

1295
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:22,751
你說呢 洛奇
{\fs12}What you think, Rock?

1296
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,088
要是最後得靠裁判打分定輸贏 他們是有優勢的
{\fs12}It's a clear advantage if it comes down to a judge's decision.

1297
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,218
就只好把他徹底擊倒 不勞裁判費心了 對嗎
{\fs12}Well, then we can't let it get to a judge's decision, right?

1298
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,432
真要命
{\fs12}Oh, shit.

1299
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:40,602
那聯繫巴迪嗎
{\fs12}Call the promoter.

1300
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,984
明早五點在這訓練嗎

{\fs12}No, I got other plans.

1302
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,949
你是說回費城去嗎 不
{\fs12}You mean, you wanna go to Philly? - No.

1303
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,868
聽著 你要是想一鼓作氣扭轉乾
{\fs12}Listen, you wanna change things in a big way,

1304
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,412
那就必須先讓自己脫胎換骨
{\fs12}then you need to make some big changes.

1305
01:31:02,844 --> 01:31:06,802
<i>我會呆在湖邊</i>

{\fs12}You got to be messing with me, right?

1314
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:00,849
聽說如果有哪個拳手想重頭來過
{\fs12}Heard this is a place where fighters go,

1315
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,435

讓自己涅槃重生
{\fs12}Get reborn.

1317
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:10,817
怎麼這麼晚才到
{\fs12}What took y'all so long?

1318
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,736
找不到地方上廁所嗎
{\fs12}This some wild shit.

1319
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,739
是 對我來說簡直是地獄
{\fs12}Yeah, sure looks like hell to me.

1320
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,325
既然你要重新回到地獄 就快點適應這
{\fs12}Since you're going back to hell, you might as well get used to it.

1321
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,455

{\fs12}Harder.

1328

再過幾分鐘
{\fs12}We're just minutes away from the fight

1377
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,371
這場全球矚目的世紀大戰就將開始了
{\fs12}the whole world has been waiting to see.

1378
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:59,791
這一次 是阿多尼斯·奎迪與維克托·德拉
{\fs12}The rematch between Adonis Creed and Viktor Drago

1379
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:02,085
第二次為爭奪世界重量級拳王開戰
{\fs12}for the heavyweight championship of the world.

1380
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:03,878
賽前有一點值得一提 吉姆
{\fs12}The unique thing about this fight, Jim,

1381
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:09,509
那就是阿多尼斯·奎迪在拳擊博彩中的賠率只有1:25 非常不被看好
{\fs12}is Adonis Creed comes in a 25-to-1 underdog,

1382
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:10,968
他可是衛冕的一方
{\fs12}and he's the champ!

1383
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:13,262
那相信大家都很好奇
{\fs12}Well, it's gonna be fascinating to see

1384
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:16,724
這件事對他踏上拳台後的心態 會有什麼影響
{\fs12}what that does to Creed's mindset as he enters the ring.

1385
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:18,271
德拉戈又會怎麼想呢
{\fs12}Not to mention Drago's.

1386
01:38:18,296 --> 01:38:19,663
<i>德拉戈</i>

1387
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:26,442

{\fs12}Drago! Drago! Drago!

1388
01:39:04,316 --> 01:39:06,921
<i>德拉戈對戰奎迪</i>

1389
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,575
德拉戈上場了
{\fs12}And there he is.

1390
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:19,579
女士們先生們 維克托·德拉戈 此時他正向體育場走來
{\fs12}Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Drago! Making his way into the arena.

1391
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:23,374
星然還沒有奪得金腰帶 但是在俄羅斯人的心中
{\fs12}He does not have the belt, but to everyone here in Russia

1392
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,126
甚至在全世界很多觀眾心中
{\fs12}and to many around the world,

1393
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,462
他才是真正的重量級拳王
{\fs12}he is the true heavyweight champion.

1394
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:06,459
上場吧 孩子
{\fs12}It's time, kid.

1395
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,595
奎迪與德拉戈的這一戰無可避免
{\fs12}There was no way Creed could have run from this fight.

1396
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:21,182
因為拳擊迷的呼聲太高 都希望他重返拳台和德拉戈再戰
{\fs12}There was such high demand for Adonis to step back in the ring with Viktor.

1397
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:25,811
我相信伊凡時隔多年回到祖國 感覺應該相當好
{\fs12}And I'm sure Ivan feels good to be back home after all these years.

{\fs12}This is it, Jim. Creed versus Drago part two.

1419

奎迪今晚狀態不錯
{\fs12}Creed looks good tonight,

1422
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:30,227
他傷痕纍纍 其中最嚴重的 是一根肋骨被打至斷裂
{\fs12}Numerous injuries, not least of all, a nasty broken rib

1423
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:32,063
還有一側腎臟破裂
{\fs12}and a ruptured kidney.

1424
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,898
這次他有一大變化
{\fs12}A huge difference in this fight

1425
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:37,902
那就是他請回了著名教練 前拳王洛奇·巴爾博亞作為指導
{\fs12}is he's got former champ Rocky Balboa back in his corner.

1426
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:39,654
有洛奇坐鎮
{\fs12}And Rocky assures everyone

1427
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:42,573
本場比賽奎迪應該會有脫胎換骨的表現
{\fs12}this fight will be very different from its predecessor.

1428
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:50,498
晚上好女士們先生們 終於等到今晚了
{\fs12}Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is it.

1429
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,334
本次十二回合制的
{\fs12}Twelve rounds of boxing

1430
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:57,505
世界重量全世界級拳王衛冕賽  即將開戰
{\fs12}for the heavyweight championship of the world!

1431
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,757
女士們先生們
{\fs12}Ladies and gentlemen,

1432
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:02,843
讓我們為拳手們吶喊吧
{\fs12}let's get ready to rumble!

1433
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:10,101
你能感覺到今晚拳台上一觸即發的緊張感 吉姆
{\fs12}You can feel the nervous energy in the arena tonight, Jim.

1434
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:12,770
奎迪竟然有膽量再次面對
{\fs12}Creed has some courage to get back into the ring

1435
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:14,897
曾經差點終結自己職業生涯的對手
{\fs12}with 2 man who nearly ended his career.

1436
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:18,109
對拳王之位志在必得的德拉戈
{\fs12}A man who is hungry to be champ.

1437
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,324
兩位
{\fs12}Fighters,

1438
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:28,619
我要一場公平乾淨地比賽 要乾乾淨淨地比賽
{\fs12}I want good, clean fight.

1439
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:33,040
我說分開 你們就分開
{\fs12}Break when I tell you to break.

1440
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:35,960
我讓你們退回場角 你們就回到場角 我說分開 你們就分開
{\fs12}You go to your corner when I tell you to go to your corner.

1441
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:43,467
碰拳套 祝你們好運
{\fs12}Touch gloves.

1442
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:47,221
洛奇·巴爾博亞和伊凡·德拉戈
{\fs12}Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago sharing the ring

1443
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:49,223
時隔三十年再一次站上了同一個拳台
{\fs12}for the first time in 30 years.

1444
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:53,936
所有人都知道 要備戰德拉戈這麼強的對手 只能找洛奇
{\fs12}If anyone knows how to take on a slugger like Drago, it would be Rocky.

1445
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:56,480
你知道你心媬N著怎樣的火
{\fs12}You know you got the fire in your gut,

1446
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:59,984
而我知道你會在拳台上怎樣活
{\fs12}and I know you'll do what needs to be done.

1447
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:04,613
因為現在 你已經明白自己為什麼而戰 這一次無論如何 都要拿下金腰帶
{\fs12}Because now, you know what you're fighting for.

1448
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:12,538
德拉戈上一次狠狠壓制了奎迎的比賽戰術
{\fs12}Viktor overwhelmed Creed's previous game plan,

1449
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:13,873
現在阿多尼斯應該還有陰影
{\fs12}and I think it got in Adonis' head.

1450
01:44:13,898 --> 01:44:15,541
你一定能贏

1451
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:18,586
所以我們都非常期待看到洛奇·巴爾博亞的訓練成果
{\fs12}It's gonna be interesting to see how Rocky Balboa has prepared Creed

1452
01:44:18,669 --> 01:44:21,672
看他如何幫助奎迪備戰這場激烈對抗
{\fs12}for what is surely to become an all-out brawl.

1453
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:23,007
好了嗎
{\fs12}Ready?

1454
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:25,009
好了嗎
{\fs12}Ready?

1455
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,886
開始
{\fs12}Box.

1456
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:28,012
比賽正式開始
{\fs12}And we're underway.

1457
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:32,349
德拉戈連續打出了兩記勾拳 但奎迪躲開了
{\fs12}Drago comes out swinging with two hooks that Creed avoids.

1458
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,894
德拉戈又揮出一記重重的右勾拳
{\fs12}And a big right-hand right out of the gate.

1459
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:36,312
小心右拳 多尼
{\fs12}Watch that right, Donnie.

1460
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:39,982
德拉戈有點意外 奎迪竟然躲開了他的攻擊
{\fs12}Drago a bit surprised as Creed shakes that punch off.

1461
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:42,992
你還愣著幹什麼 繼續攻擊

1462
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:48,741
一記右直拳 德拉戈步步緊逼 不過奎迪並沒有就此退縮
{\fs12}Drago is pressing hard, but Creed is not backing off.

1463
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:51,494
腳下別停
{\fs12}Keep moving, keep moving.

1464
01:44:51,577 --> 01:44:54,205
奎迪今今晚與德拉戈對打 採取了貼身戰術
{\fs12}Creed working a little bit closer to Drago tonight.

1465
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:00,419
剛才奎迪鬥志昂揚地打出了一套組合拳
{\fs12}That is a vicious combination by Creed.

1466
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,592
剛剛德拉戈揮出了右拳
{\fs12}And now a right hand by Drago.

1467
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:09,553
發力了 德拉戈開始向對手反擊了
{\fs12}Here we go, Drago applying pressure.

1468
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,930
別進場角 出來 多尼
{\fs12}Out the corner! - Come on, Donnie!

1469
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,476
奎迪一個閃身 離開了場角
{\fs12}Creed manages to slip away.

1470
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:17,978
放馬過來
{\fs12}Let's get it.

1471
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:21,774
怎麼樣
{\fs12}Yeah, what's up?

1472
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:24,652
兩個人在拳台中央周旋 互有命中
{\fs12}Now they're squaring off in the middle of the ring, toe-to-toe.

1473
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,028
勢均力敵
{\fs12}Taking blows.

1474
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:27,613
奎迪連續打中對手的臉
{\fs12}Creed staying in his face.

1475
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:30,074
鈴聲響了 激烈的第一回合比賽已經結束了
{\fs12}And there's the bell! As a wild first round comes to an end.

1476
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:31,283
回你的角落
{\fs12}Go to your corner.

1477
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:34,078
德拉戈有些挫敗 今晚的奎迪就換了個人似的 馬克斯
{\fs12}Drago frustrated. Creed is looking like a different fighter tonight, Max.

1478
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:36,121
很好 就該這樣
{\fs12}That's it, D! That's it! - Yes!

1479
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:38,541
看誰還給德拉戈加油
{\fs12}Oh, yeah, who's saying Drago now, though?

1480
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:42,586
荒地堥漕ンW沒白吃吧 是
{\fs12}See, all that work in the desert paid off, right?

1481
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,213
你得手了 他就得想轍了
{\fs12}Yeah, you got him. You got him thinking.

1482
01:45:44,296 --> 01:45:45,714
他本來沒想到你會這麼打
{\fs12}He wasn't expecting what you're bringing.

1483
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:48,509
下一回合他攻勢會更猛 但你準備好了
{\fs12}Now, he's gonna bring the heat the next round, but you're ready for it.

1484
01:45:49,126 --> 01:45:50,777
難道我都白訓練你了嗎

1485
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:52,761
給我把他打趴下

1486
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:55,182
他右拳用得最多
{\fs12}He overextends his right hand.

1487
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:56,517
你先把拳頭擋住
{\fs12}You gonna counter with the right

1488
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,227
再用左拳擊垮他 懂了嗎
{\fs12}and crack him with the left. You got that?

1489
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:59,728
他出右拳 我就出左拳
{\fs12}Extend the right, crack him with the left.

1490
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:03,107
他絕對想不到這招 你爸當初就是這麼對付我的
{\fs12}He'll never expect it. His old man did the same thing to me.

1491
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:05,067
根據我剛才的觀察 馬克思
{\fs12}One early observation, Max.

1492
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,945
我覺得奎迪今晚在抵抗德拉戈但組合拳時
{\fs12}I think Creed is withstanding Drago's combinations

1493
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:10,072
表現得比上一場要好太多了
{\fs12}much better tonight than in the first fight.

1494
01:46:10,155 --> 01:46:11,156
開始
{\fs12}Box.

1495
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:13,075
第二回合比賽開始
{\fs12}And round two begins.

1496
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,370
德拉戈揮出了強勁的左勾拳
{\fs12}Drago with a huge left hook.

1497
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,291
接著右手一記重拳
{\fs12}And a big right hand.

1498
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:23,627
德拉戈發起一輪猛攻 現在把奎迪逼到圍繩邊了
{\fs12}Drago on the attack again, now driving Creed back into the ropes.

1499
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:26,088
他一直在出右拳 小心右拳
{\fs12}He's overextending the right! Watch the right!

1500
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:30,217
奎迪左右開弓 重拳出擊
{\fs12}A right and a left for Creed.

1501
01:46:42,605 --> 01:46:45,316
好一記上勾拳 奎迪抱住了德拉戈
{\fs12}Huge uppercut has Creed holding on now.

1502
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:47,526
德拉戈擺脫了 並將奎迪逼進場角
{\fs12}Drago throws him off into the corner.

1503
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,490
離開場角 快離開場角
{\fs12}Get out of that corner! - Get out of the corner!

1504
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:58,495
德拉戈把奎迪摔在了拳台上
{\fs12}And Drago throws Creed to the canvas.

1505
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:03,083
這是幹什麼呢
{\fs12}What's going on?

1506
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:06,962
上次比賽也是這樣 不過這一次德拉戈稍微克制了一點
{\fs12}Shades of the first fight, but Drago showing restraint this time.

1507
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:08,047
還行嗎
{\fs12}You good?

1508
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,131
行 沒問題
{\fs12}Yes, I'm good.

1509
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:10,747
趕緊幹掉他

1510
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:14,136
比賽短暫中止之後 德拉戈徹底爆發了
{\fs12}Box. - Drago explodes from the break.

1511
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,096
奎迪倒地了
{\fs12}And Creed is down!

1512
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:18,015
他沒擋住這一連串颶風般的重拳
{\fs12}A flurry of heavy shots!

1513
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:21,393
德拉戈的力量簡直是太驚人了
{\fs12}Drago's power is just incredible.

1514
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,063
三
{\fs12}Three.

1515
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:25,648
四
{\fs12}Four.

1516
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:28,317
等夠八秒 等夠八秒再起來
{\fs12}Take the eight count. Take the full eight.

1517
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,735
奎迪正趴在地上 抓緊時間調整
{\fs12}Creed taking his time on the canvas.

1518
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:30,819
六
{\fs12}Six.

1519
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:32,404
趴著別動 深呼吸
{\fs12}Stay down! Breathe!

1520
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,240
奎迪聽從了洛奇的指示 因為洛奇曾有過類似的比賽經歷
{\fs12}He's listening to Rocky, who has been in this situation before.

1521
01:47:35,324 --> 01:47:36,367
八
{\fs12}Eight.

1522
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,410
就在讀秒結束前 奎迪轉起來了
{\fs12}And Creed is back on his feet. Beats the count.

1523
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:39,536
好了嗎 好了 開始吧
{\fs12}Ready? - Yeah, let's go.

1524
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:40,663
開始
{\fs12}Box.

1525
01:47:40,746 --> 01:47:42,665
纏住他 別跟他打 纏住他
{\fs12}Tie him up. Don't fight him. Tie him up.

1526
01:47:42,748 --> 01:47:44,959
德拉格重整旗鼓 再次猛攻
{\fs12}Drago is right back at it.

1527
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:50,506
剛剛一個擊倒 加上最後的連續重拳
{\fs12}So, with the knockdown and those hard shots at the end,

1528
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:53,425
這一回合 德拉戈的贏面明顯要大於奎迪
{\fs12}that round clearly goes to Viktor Drago.

1529
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:55,970
而且能感覺到他的攻勢一波比一波猛
{\fs12}And you could just feel he's gaining momentum.

1530
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:57,638
這次本來就是場硬仗 對吧
{\fs12}You knew this was gonna be a war, right?

1531
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,098
你來之前就知道
{\fs12}You knew that going in there.

1532
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:01,350
從現在起拼的 就是誰更想贏
{\fs12}From now on, it's who wants it more,

1533
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:05,412
打得好

1534
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:08,732
別讓他打垮你 你在外圍轉只能挨打
{\fs12}Don't let him crack you. You stay on the outside, you're gonna get hurt.

1535
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:10,818
近身對打才能打敗他
{\fs12}You stay on the inside, you'll tear him up.

1536
01:48:10,901 --> 01:48:12,194
關鍵是得向他施壓
{\fs12}I'm telling you, it's all about pressure.

1537
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:15,531
如果想讓對方痛苦 自己得先忍受痛苦
{\fs12}If you wanna give pain, you got to be willing to take the pain.

1538
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,001
來啊
{\fs12}Come on!

1539
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:32,631
很好
{\fs12}Yes! - Yes!

1540
01:48:33,415 --> 01:48:34,651
金腰帶應亥是我們的

1541
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:36,963
可現在你要保不住它了

1542
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:39,972
第四回合 又是一個殘酷激烈的回合
{\fs12}Round four is another brutal display

1543
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:42,808
奎迪被動地受著德拉戈的連續重擊
{\fs12}as Creed takes a lot of punishment from Drago.

1544
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:47,021
德拉戈絲毫沒有放緩自己的攻勢
{\fs12}Drago is not slowing down.

1545
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:49,565
鈴響之後 還對奎迪使出了一記重拳
{\fs12}Landing a big shot after the bell.

1546
01:48:51,025 --> 01:48:52,151
你們是怎麼回事
{\fs12}What is your problem?

1547
01:48:53,493 --> 01:48:54,547
<i>第五回合</i>

1548
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:58,157
這兩位殘暴的對抗還在繼續 吉姆
{\fs12}The violent chess match continues, Jim.

1549
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,035
奎迪又一次被擊倒了
{\fs12}Oh, and Creed is down again.

1550
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:02,786
多尼 起來
{\fs12}Donnie, get up.

1551
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:07,124
德拉戈明顯佔據了上風 不過奎迪也沒想放棄
{\fs12}Drago clearly dominating this fight, but Creed will not give up.

1552
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,834
他這幾回合可是受了不少罪
{\fs12}He is taking a lot of punishment.

1553
01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:10,335
你就貼身緊逼 看著我
{\fs12}You got to stay in his face. Look at me.

1554
01:49:10,419 --> 01:49:12,421
你要做的就勝貼身緊逼
{\fs12}You got to stay in his face.

1555
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:20,637
這就對了
{\fs12}There you are!

1556
01:49:24,099 --> 01:49:25,350
德拉戈的節奏亂了
{\fs12}Drago is cut now.

1557
01:49:29,938 --> 01:49:31,482
第八回合結束 比賽進行到這個階段
{\fs12}As we enter round eight,

1558
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:34,777
超乎我們所有人的預料
{\fs12}we are deeper into this fight than anyone expected.

1559
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,988
奎迪自知比分落後 開始逼自己發動進攻
{\fs12}Creed must sense he's behind. He's trying to force the action.

1560
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:42,034
很好 兒子
{\fs12}Yes, baby!

1561
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:53,879
今晚我們一路看著阿多尼斯·奎迪
{\fs12}What we are seeing tonight is Adonis Creed

1562
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:57,132
站上拳台 正面迎擊實力非同凡響的維克托·德拉戈
{\fs12}standing up to the awesome power of Viktor Drago.

1563
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:58,884
他絲毫沒有退縮
{\fs12}He's not going anywhere.

1564
01:50:02,458 --> 01:50:04,527
再把他放倒一次

1565
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:10,312
維克托看上去很累 馬克斯
{\fs12}Viktor Drago looks tired, Max.

1566
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:14,024
要知道之前他打職業拳賽的時候 從來不必打第四回合
{\fs12}Keep in mind, he's never had to go past the 4th round in a professional fight.

1567
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,738
他在幹什麼 扣分啊 裁判
{\fs12}Hey! What was that? - Take the point, ref!

1568
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:21,281
德拉戈連出兩記重拳
{\fs12}And Drago drops Creed

1569
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:22,866
又讓奎迪倒在了拳台上
{\fs12}-with two nasty body shots. - Come on!

1570
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:24,952
哪有拽著人打的 一
{\fs12}He held him and hit him. - One.

1571
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:28,413
維克托拽住對手攻擊 卻僥倖逃過了判罰
{\fs12}Viktor holding and maybe getting away with something there.

1572
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:30,249
可能是裁判沒有看清
{\fs12}The ref must not have seen it.

1573
01:50:32,334 --> 01:50:33,377
過來
{\fs12}Come on.

1574
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,255
我看洛奇·巴爾博亞得考慮是不是該談輸了 吉姆
{\fs12}I think Rocky Balboa has a decision to make here, Jim.

1575
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:37,965
他比任何人都清楚
{\fs12}He knows better than anyone

1576
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:41,635
三十年前他遇到同樣的情況時 是麼樣的結局
{\fs12}how this same story played out three decades ago.

1577
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:43,095
多尼 跟我說話
{\fs12}Donnie, Donnie, talk to me.

1578
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:44,179
多尼
{\fs12}Donnie.

1579
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:45,806
你的肋骨
{\fs12}Your ribs?

1580
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:47,266
斷了嗎
{\fs12}You think it's broke?

1581
01:50:53,332 --> 01:50:54,751
幹掉他

1582
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:58,777
你想怎麼辦 多尼
{\fs12}What do you wanna do, Donnie?

1583
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:01,738
要我認輸嗎
{\fs12}You wanna call it?

1584
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:07,953
我想也不是
{\fs12}I didn't think so.

1585
01:51:08,391 --> 01:51:10,810
上 下 上 下

1586
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,668
接下來他會窮追不捨
{\fs12}Now he's gonna come after you,

1587
01:51:14,751 --> 01:51:16,670
攻擊你的肋骨 讓它徹底斷掉
{\fs12}and he's gonna try to break on that rib some more.

1588
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:18,380
但沒關係
{\fs12}But that's okay.

1589
01:51:18,714 --> 01:51:20,299
因為你享受疼痛 你扛得住
{\fs12}"Cause you like the pain. You can take it.

1590
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:22,634
為什麼 因為你很強大
{\fs12}You know why? Because you're dangerous.

1591
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:25,262
我很強大 說得沒錯
{\fs12}I'm dangerous. - That's right.

1592
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:27,097
還有十秒
{\fs12}Ten seconds out.

1593
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:46,533
現在到了第十回合的比賽
{\fs12}Now here we go with round ten

1594
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:48,827
這場比賽已經成了一場艱苦的拉鋸戰
{\fs12}of what has become a war of attrition.

1595
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:53,290
目前計分牌顯示德拉戈暫時領先 但奎迪 他完全沒打算認輸
{\fs12}Drago seemingly ahead on the scorecards, but Creed refusing to back down.

1596
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:54,833
就這麼打 多尼 很好
{\fs12}That's it, Donnie. Good.

1597
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,920
奎迪現在已經是使出了渾身的力氣
{\fs12}Creed using whatever he has left in the tank.

1598
01:51:58,295 --> 01:52:00,005
德拉戈在集中攻擊他的身體
{\fs12}Drago working the body.

1599
01:52:00,088 --> 01:52:01,215
纏住他
{\fs12}Tie him up!

1600
01:52:06,595 --> 01:52:08,347
奎迪再次被擊倒在地
{\fs12}And down goes Creed again.

1601
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:11,016
這場比賽可能要到此為止了
{\fs12}And this could be the end of the fight.

1602
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,263
快認輸吧 別死撐了

1603
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:42,130
起來 多尼
{\fs12}Get up, D.

1604
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:57,562
沒有人能抗得住德拉戈那樣的重拳
{\fs12}No man should be able to fight through that beating,

1605
01:52:57,646 --> 01:52:59,398
但阿多尼斯·奎迪
{\fs12}but Adonis Creed wills himself off the canvas.

1606
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:00,941
你叫什麼 奎迪
{\fs12}What's your name? - Creed.

1607
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:02,484
你叫什麼
{\fs12}What's your name?

1608
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:04,236
奎迪
{\fs12}Creed!

1609
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:08,865
開始
{\fs12}Box!

1610
01:53:08,949 --> 01:53:12,911
阿多尼斯·奎迪知道 維克托·德拉戈是他必須跨越的障礙
{\fs12}Adonis Creed knows there is no way around Viktor Drago.

1611
01:53:12,995 --> 01:53:14,621
他一定要攻克他
{\fs12}He has to go through him.

1612
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:17,541
重錘
{\fs12}Dig!

1613
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:19,876
重錘 重錘
{\fs12}Dig! Dig!

1614
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,336
奎迪突然像多了個馬達一樣
{\fs12}Creed suddenly finding another gear!

1615
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,421
加油
{\fs12}Come on!

1616
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,173
德拉戈有些站不穩了
{\fs12}Drago's on his heels.

1617
01:53:30,554 --> 01:53:32,431
德拉戈被擊倒了
{\fs12}And down goes Drago!

1618
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,476
這就對了 就該這樣
{\fs12}That's it! That's right!

1619
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:39,479
拳台上的局勢瞬間扭轉了
{\fs12}What a wild turn of events.

1620
01:53:40,322 --> 01:53:41,651
站起來

1621
01:53:42,774 --> 01:53:43,859
二
{\fs12}Two.

1622
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:46,486
多尼 等他一起來 就乘勝追擊
{\fs12}Donnie, he gets up, you go after him.

1623
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:47,654
三
{\fs12}Three.

1624
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:50,324
四
{\fs12}Four.

1625
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:53,535
五
{\fs12}Five.

1626
01:53:55,537 --> 01:53:57,622
六 德拉戈及時站起來了
{\fs12}Six. - Drago beats the count.

1627
01:53:57,706 --> 01:54:01,585
真不敢相信 這兩位到這一刻居然還能站得住
{\fs12}I can't believe either of these guys are still on their feet.

1628
01:54:06,757 --> 01:54:07,966
開始
{\fs12}Box.

1629
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:16,558
德拉戈在比分上應該是大幅領先
{\fs12}Drago seemingly so far ahead on points, he just needs to stay upright

1630
01:54:16,641 --> 01:54:18,185
他只要不被擊倒在地 撐到最後就能贏
{\fs12}and make it to the end.

1631
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:22,147
奎迪再次進攻 讓德拉戈在圍繩邊動彈不得
{\fs12}Here comes Creed again, driving Drago back into the ropes.

1632
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:23,732
重錘重錘 打倒他
{\fs12}Dig! Dig! Dig! - Yeah!

1633
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:27,986
加油 把他擊倒
{\fs12}Come on, take him down!

1634
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:30,614
加油 寶貝
{\fs12}Come on, baby.

1635
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,578
維克托·德拉戈被擊倒在地
{\fs12}And Viktor Drago is down!

1636
01:54:36,661 --> 01:54:37,829
第二次了
{\fs12}Again!

1637
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,707
這場比賽局勢變化太大了
{\fs12}What a turn this fight has taken.

1638
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:53,804
奎迪已經疼得直不起腰了
{\fs12}Creed doubled over in pain

1639
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:56,681
而德拉戈正努力從拳台上爬起來
{\fs12}as Drago tries to pick himself up off the floor.

1640
01:54:59,625 --> 01:55:00,624
三

1641
01:55:02,818 --> 01:55:03,817
四

1642
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,038
五

1643
01:55:07,683 --> 01:55:08,988
六

1644
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:12,077
七

1645
01:55:16,067 --> 01:55:17,964
站起來

1646
01:55:18,204 --> 01:55:19,203
八

1647
01:55:22,857 --> 01:55:23,663
九

1648
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:30,340
德拉戈拼盡了全力 在讀秒結束前站了起來
{\fs12}Drago summons the strength, manages to make the count.

1649
01:55:44,438 --> 01:55:46,189
他們還在揮動著拳頭 馬克斯
{\fs12}They're still swinging, Max.

1650
01:55:46,898 --> 01:55:48,900
奎迪還在持續不斷地攻
{\fs12}Creed continuing to connect.

1651
01:55:48,984 --> 01:55:51,528
這場面已經讓人不忍心看下去了 吉姆
{\fs12}And this is becoming hard to watch, Jim.

1652
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:53,989
在我看來 德拉戈已經無力反抗了
{\fs12}I don't think Drago has anything left,

1653
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:56,324
但他就是死活不肯放棄
{\fs12}but he refuses to give up.

1654
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:22,434
好了 比賽結束
{\fs12}And that's it! It's over!

1655
01:56:23,602 --> 01:56:25,979
老德拉戈作為教練 扔毛巾認輸了
{\fs12}Drago's corner throws in the towel.

1656
01:56:26,062 --> 01:56:29,483
而阿多尼斯·奎迪衛冕了拳王之位
{\fs12}And Adonis Creed defends his title.

1657
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:31,234
也守住了名譽
{\fs12}Defends his name.

1658
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:33,487
更創造出了屬於自己的傳奇
{\fs12}Creates his own legacy.

1659
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:37,616
他依舊是手握金腰帶的世界重量級拳王
{\fs12}He is still the heavyweight champion of the world.

1660
01:56:39,201 --> 01:56:44,247
現場的俄羅斯觀眾 此刻也都紛紛起立 為這位美國拳手鼓掌喝彩
{\fs12}And the Russian crowd is standing and cheering for the American fighter.

1661
01:56:54,727 --> 01:56:56,405
維克托 維克托
{\fs12}Viktor, Viktor.

1662
01:56:56,773 --> 01:56:57,928
維克
{\fs12}Vic.

1663
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:01,181
比安呢 比安
{\fs12}Where's B at? Where's B?

1664
01:57:01,264 --> 01:57:03,225
慢點慢點
{\fs12}Easy, easy, easy.

1665
01:57:03,308 --> 01:57:06,186
讓開 大家都讓開一點 讓他透口氣
{\fs12}Hey, back up. Everybody back up. We need air.

1666
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:08,146
好了
{\fs12}Yeah.

1667
01:57:11,608 --> 01:57:13,235
我們做到了 我們做到了
{\fs12}We did it. - We did it.

1668
01:57:26,976 --> 01:57:28,698
沒關係

1669
01:57:29,196 --> 01:57:30,178
沒關係

1670
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:39,052
我們回家
{\fs12}Let's go home. - Let's go, D.
