

2
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,038
Yeah. We got this.

3
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,907
<i>...here at
the MGM Grand tonight, Roy.</i>

4
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:25,679
<i>And, you know, when Adonis Creed
lost to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan,</i>

5
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:28,682
<i>he was really a curiosity
more than anything else.</i>

6
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:30,584
<i>But that was an epic fight,</i>

7
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,885
<i>and since then, he's reeled
off six straight wins,</i>

8
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:37,256
<i>and tonight attempts against
Danny "The Stuntman" Wheeler</i>

9
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:40,627
<i>to become the heavyweight
champion of the world.</i>

10
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,664
<i>It bears mentioning that Creed
actually wagered his Mustang</i>

11
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,066
<i>before their
sparring session, Roy.</i>

12
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:51,203
<i>And rumor has it that same
Mustang is on the line again tonight.</i>

13
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:54,642
Okay, everybody out.
Let's go.

14
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:00,881
- Hey.
- Hey.

15
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,782
- Feel good?
- Mmm-hmm.

16
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:06,485
Yeah. Remember to
keep your right hand up, okay?

17
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,322
His left is just as strong
as his right.

18
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:10,324
- Yep.
- Yeah.

19
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,603
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Okay, good.

20
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:28,074
It's just another fight, okay?

21
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,579
You got this.

22
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:47,327
You know, there's only
three steps into that ring.

23
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:49,596
Just three.

24
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:54,034
And tonight, it's gonna
look as high as a mountain.

25
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:59,704
And when you climb
through them ropes,

26
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,907
it's gonna be the loneliest
place in the world

27
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,176
because you're gonna be
in there with another fighter

28
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,513
who wants to take you out.

29
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,315
So now,
you gotta ask yourself,

30
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,752
are you here to prove
something to other people

31
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:16,690
or prove something
to yourself?

32
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:22,329
To myself.

33
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,030
Right.

34
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,366
Now, let me ask you something.

35
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,369
What?

36
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:33,003
What's with the hair?

37
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:36,608
I combed it.
It's a special night.

38
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,646
Shouldn't you be thinking
about something else, wise guy?

39
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,050
Now, you can go prove it.

40
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:48,753
Now go get your Mustang back.

41
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,892
These guys have really been
mixing it up here in the fourth.

42
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:57,294
So far, Creed's youth
outweighing Wheeler's experience.

43
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,263
Let's go! Let's go, baby.
Let's o!

44
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:02,967
Maybe the most amazing part
of Adonis Creed's journey, Roy...

45
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,501
Don't drop that guard! Sit.

46
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:05,836
...is that tonight,
he fights...

47
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:07,804
Keep your hands up!

48
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:09,273
...for the same belt held by
both his trainer, Rocky Balboa,

49
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:12,209
and his father,
the great Apollo Creed.

50
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,111
Whoo!

51
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:17,281
Wheeler seems to be waking up.
We've seen this before, Roy.

52
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:20,553
When Wheeler smells blood,
he really turns it on.

53
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,494
Come on back.

54
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,503
Come on, D!

55
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,471
Three years ago,
that's a knockout.

56
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:44,777
Wheeler's power just isn't the same,
and no doubt Creed can sense it.

57
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:47,978
You got him. Stay on him!

58
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,247
Creed's on a mission,
really pressing the issue now.

59
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,017
And a big left hook
lands flush!

60
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,721
Creed staying in the pocket, Max.
Moving, not running.

61
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:59,655
Come on, now!
Hands up! Hands up!

62
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:02,124
These two men
are really going at it.

63
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:03,961
Tell him, Donnie!

64
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,227
Another left hook
drives Wheeler back.

65
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:06,464
Come on, baby!

66
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,533
That was a sneaky little
uppercut on the inside,

67
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:12,268
and Wheeler's hurt
by that, Roy.

68
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,869
Yeah, that wobbled
his legs pretty bad.

69
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,039
- Another big shot!
- Hold him, hold him, hold him!

70
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,673
Creed has him
in trouble, Max.

71
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:19,410
Wheeler's doing
what he can...

72
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:24,213
Wheeler is down!

73
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:25,715
Wheeler has hit the canvas!

74
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:27,350
Now stay there, boy!

75
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:28,918
Creed taught you!

76
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,353
Come and give me my keys!

77
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,622
Get up! Come on, baby!

78
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:34,090
Get up, get up!

79
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:35,725
- Wheeler, trying to get up.
- One!

80
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:37,426
- Stay down!
- Two!

81
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:38,894
I don't know
if he makes this count, Roy.

82
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,261
Three!

83
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,499
Four!

84
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,599
Five!

85
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:44,602
Six!

86
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:46,869
Seven!

87
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:47,872
Eight!

88
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,106
Nine!

89
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,539
That's it. That's it.

90
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,809
And it's over, Max.

91
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:56,078
No way! Adonis Creed...

92
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,747
Give me my keys!

93
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:00,417
...is the heavyweight
champion of the world.

94
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:04,120
You know what you just did?

95
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,387
Yeah.

96
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,823
Baby, you know
what just happened?

97
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:14,629
When you think of
where this kid has come from,

98
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:18,333
the most unlikely beginning
for a fighter, Roy.

99
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,069
Growing up the way he did

100
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,304
to make it to the top
of boxing in this way...

101
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:24,673
It's unprecedented!

102
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,641
Creed! Creed! Creed!

103
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,444
It's one thing to be
the number one contender.

104
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:32,547
It's a whole other thing
to be champion.

105
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:39,154
This is the first step to
building a legacy of his own,

106
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:44,260
and I can hardly wait to see
what's next for Adonis Creed.

107
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,131
Whoa.

108
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,533
I mean, what do you think?

109
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:53,034
That's...

110
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,803
That is beautiful.

111
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:56,037
- Right?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,639
But we gotta hurry up.

113
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,239
I mean, she's about to
get out the shower any second.

114
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,241
Yo, Donnie, why didn't you
tell me about this before?

115
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:02,443
I didn't know
if I was gonna win.

116
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,411
What's that got to do with it?

117
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:06,413
I don't know.

118
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,482
Look, just tell me
what I should do.

119
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,019
You get down on one knee.

120
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,252
People still do that shit?

121
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:13,922
You can always
send her a text.

122
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,590
Come on, Unc,
I'm being serious, all right?

123
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,059
I mean, what did you say?

124
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,127
- To Adrian?
- Yeah.

125
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,228
It was a long time ago.

126
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,598
We were at the zoo.
It was winter. It was snowing.

127
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Everything smelled fresh.

128
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:29,870
There was this tiger.
He had snow on its back.

129
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:32,639
- And he's walking in the background.
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

130
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,209
Just tell me what you said.

131
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:35,943
Well, I was getting
to that part.

132
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,678
What I said is...

133
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,681
I asked if she would not mind
marrying me very much,

134
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:45,152
which is kind of a dumb way
of saying she's my world,

135
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,823
and she made me better
than I deserved to be.

136
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:50,358
You know?

137
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:53,894
Yeah.

138
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:56,730
Listen, why don't you
just turn off your brain

139
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:58,801
and let your heart
do the talking.

140
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,636
Click.

141
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,670
You'll do good.

142
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,640
- Turn my brain off?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,010
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

144
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:10,911
- All right.
- All right.

145
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:12,347
All right, I'm on it.

146
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,588
- Hey, Unc.
- Mmm.

147
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,590
You good?

148
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:26,961
Yeah, real good. Thank you.

149
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,397
- Great.
- All right.

150
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,925
Will you marry me?

151
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,438
Listen, B.

152
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:15,274
I know we've been
dating for a few years now,

153
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,476
and it's just something
about us that just click.

154
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:20,313
I don't know
how to explain it,

155
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:24,416
but the feeling I get when
you're by my side is a feeling

156
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:27,352
that I can't live without.

157
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,622
I know I sound crazy, but, look,
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

158
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:37,963
Will you marry me?

159
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,631
I'm still hungry, babe,

160
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,968
I don't know why.

161
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,506
Are you for real, D?

162
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,241
Yeah, I'm for real.

163
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,009
No, stop playin'.

164
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,145
I ain't playin'.

165
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,449
You didn't hear any of that?

166
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,451
None of what?

167
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,622
Hmm.

168
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,659
None of what, D?

169
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:16,502
What did you say?

170
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,942
Nothing that you don't
already know.

171
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,645
Remind me.

172
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,948
I said that I love you,

173
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,653
and that I need you.

174
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,223
D, do you know
what you're doing right now?

175
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:39,623
I mean, yeah, kind of.

176
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,093
What do you mean, "kind of"?

177
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:44,830
Babe!

178
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,830
I mean...

179
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:48,668
To keep it real with you, B,

180
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,837
you're the only person

181
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,840
I wanna share my moments with.

182
00:13:58,477 --> 00:13:59,845
So, Bianca Taylor,

183
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:08,654
will you marry me?

184
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:12,555
Yo.

185
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,995
Yo.

186
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:19,897
- "Yo"? Is that a yes?
- Yes.

187
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:20,998
It's yes?

188
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,267
Yes!

189
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,502
Yeah.

190
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:19,556
Viktor.

191
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,358
Our boy's
looking good.

192
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,097
I'm sure you heard
the good news.

193
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,166
It's time.

194
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,540
You ever thought
about going back to LA?

195
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,777
Please, you're a Philly girl.

196
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,213
Yeah, I guess,

197
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:19,548
but it'd be nice
to have more space.

198
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,682
And your mom's out there...

199
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:24,119
And them labels, too.

200
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,555
Could help me get my
music out to more people.

201
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,656
Hmm.

202
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:32,262
I don't know, I feel like I've done
everything I could in Philly, you know?

203
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:38,368
Time ain't exactly on my side,
you know?

204
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:42,805
Mmm-hmm.

205
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:48,711
What about Rocky?

206
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:52,913
Rocky has his life, D.

207
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,351
We gotta start ours.

208
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:35,224
<i>It's a cold one today,
Adrian, that's for sure.</i>

209
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:41,428
I tried calling our son Bobby
a few times.

210
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,198
But I'd hang up every time
he was about to pick up

211
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,935
because, to tell you the truth,
I didn't know what to say to him.

212
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,036
What if he's moving on,

213
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:52,672
and I'm like this chunk of
yesterday trying to be today?

214
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:53,942
I just don't fit in.

215
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:58,046
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

216
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:04,083
Knock on his door and say,
"Hey, how you doing?

217
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:07,956
"What's it been, a lot
of years?" I don't know.

218
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:22,270
I miss you.

219
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,461
You've been hype
ever since you got this jawn.

220
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:22,761
What are you talking about?

221
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:24,231
That smile right there.

222
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,832
You're cheezin'.

223
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,735
It's the only thing
my pops left me.

224
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,902
I mean, that and these hands.

225
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,274
- You never told me that.
- Yeah.

226
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:38,012
What's up with you
and these secrets, Don?

227
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,555
How're you doing?
All right, all right.

228
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,324
But look at this, here.

229
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,161
- How you doing?
- Hey.

230
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,063
- Hey, Isabelle.
- Hey, Rock.

231
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,267
Hey, listen. Some big guy's sitting
over there, waiting for you.

232
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,004
He said you'll know who he is.

233
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,742
Yo, champ.

234
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:14,011
You gotta take that fight, man.
Shut this dude up.

235
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,047
No, Wheeler
still talking shit?

236
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,616
It's a little early
for a rematch, bro.

237
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,652
Hey, turn the TV up.

238
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,356
<i>...and the tragic
history that connects them.</i>

239
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,870
That you?

240
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,875
Nice pictures.

241
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,280
Yeah, they're okay.

242
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,385
No pictures of me.

243
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,321
No, there's no pictures
of that.

244
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,592
Why are you in Philly?

245
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,893
You don't know?

246
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,864
<i>Ukrainian boxer Viktor Drago
appeared today in Philadelphia</i>

247
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,834
<i>to issue
a very public challenge</i>

248
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,969
<i>to recently crowned heavyweight
champion Adonis Creed.</i>

249
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:17,040
<i>A press conference was held earlier
by boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle.</i>

250
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,377
<i>We came all the way to Philly
to let you know it's serious.</i>

251
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,380
<i>Now, this man here,
he ain't no Danny Wheeler.</i>

252
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,984
<i>And let's be honest, Creed fought
him three years too late, anyway.</i>

253
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,221
<i>Easy match.</i>

254
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,524
<i>People in this country
love you.</i>

255
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,262
But Russia,

256
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,333
no one touch
Drago name.

257
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,336
Everything changed that night.

258
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,439
Look, you know, that's like

259
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,275
a million years ago.

260
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,843
Like yesterday to me.

261
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,013
So, you came all the way
over here to tell me that?

262
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:01,284
<i>It's no coincidence
that Ivan Drago's son shows up</i>

263
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,254
<i>right after Apollo Creed's son
claims the belt.</i>

264
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,424
<i>This is Creed versus Drago.</i>

265
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,958
<i>This is the fight
the whole world wants to see.</i>

266
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,294
And this is the fight
he should take.

267
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:14,997
Unless he's afraid of
history repeating itself.

268
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,133
<i>That history
being the infamous 1985 match</i>

269
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:22,572
<i>in which boxing legend Apollo
Creed was killed by Russian fighter</i>

270
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,273
<i>Ivan Drago.</i>

271
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,276
<i>Apollo's trainer Rocky Balboa
was heavily criticized</i>

272
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:29,146
<i>for failing
to stop that fight.</i>

273
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,582
D. Baby.

274
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,352
It's a publicity stunt.

275
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,988
Don't worry about that.

276
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,090
<i>And let's not forget,</i>

277
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:46,597
<i>later that year, Balboa defeated
Drago in his own backyard, Russia.</i>

278
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:51,302
<i>Because of you,
I lose everything.</i>

279
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:54,171
Country.

280
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:56,373
Respect.

281
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:02,111
Wife.

282
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:07,749
You ever see stray dogs
in Ukraine?

283
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:09,518
They go for days with no food.

284
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,521
People spit on them.
They have nothing.

285
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:14,288
No home.

286
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,394
Only will to survive,
to fight.

287
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:23,399
I have son.

288
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:30,573
All he knows

289
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:33,042
is this.

290
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:41,551
My son will break your boy.

291
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,354
Been a long day.

292
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,057
I think we're done here.

293
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,530
Because around here
we put strays away.

294
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:09,679
Hmm.

295
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:19,656
It's good picture.

296
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:32,165
I kind of figured
you'd be here.

297
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:35,772
You know, I tried calling and calling,
but nobody picked up or anything.

298
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,510
Kind of early to be training,
don't you think, after a fight?

299
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:45,113
Just trying to clear my head.

300
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:47,781
I get that.

301
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:50,183
Cheaper than a shrink,
that's for sure.

302
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:55,155
Hey, Don, come on.
I heard what's going on.

303
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:57,359
But you can't let them
get inside.

304
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:01,161
But I know how you're feeling.

305
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:04,464
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

306
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:08,437
What happened a long time ago, that
ain't got nothing to do with you.

307
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:14,841
Listen, that fight is
what Apollo wanted, all right?

308
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:16,743
It shouldn't have happened.

309
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:17,746
But it did.

310
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:22,149
And you gotta let it go.

311
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:24,751
Come on.

312
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:30,991
You've seen him fight, though?

313
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:34,293
I've seen him on sports TV
and stuff like that.

314
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:36,564
He's big, but he's raw.

315
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:41,369
He ain't no mean machine
like you are, that's for sure.

316
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:43,837
You know what?

317
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,405
I'm gonna cheer you up, 'cause
today's gonna be your lucky day.

318
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:48,374
Christmas just came early
for you,

319
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:50,476
'cause I'm gonna hold the bag,
lucky guy.

320
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:52,444
- No, you're the one who's lucky.
- How's that?

321
00:25:52,446 --> 00:25:53,980
'Cause I'm gonna let you
hold the bag for me.

322
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:55,581
Yo.

323
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,752
That's it. That's better.

324
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:31,686
<i>Creed taking major hits.
This could be over soon.</i>

325
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:37,524
<i>Creed is down!
And he could be badly hurt.</i>

326
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:41,093
<i>Apollo on the floor
looking unresponsive.</i>

327
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:42,529
<i>This doesn't look good.</i>

328
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:45,733
<i>There is no movement.</i>

329
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:01,779
<i>♪ Glitter in
my eyes And I was young</i>

330
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:06,417
<i>♪ Know what they say
I ran away from home</i>

331
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,254
<i>♪ I thank you
I learned the world</i>

332
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:11,725
<i>♪ Hoo hoo, yeah</i>

333
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,394
<i>♪ They think I'm a broken girl</i>

334
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:18,696
<i>♪ Hoo hoo, yeah</i>

335
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:21,935
<i>♪ I think I'm in love
with lost</i>

336
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:24,769
Amazing voice.

337
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:28,340
<i>♪ My heart cracked
But at least it's touched ♪</i>

338
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:30,810
Sorry for the theatrics.

339
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:33,546
But people like a good show.

340
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:36,547
That was a grimy move, brah.

341
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:38,348
Ain't nothing personal.

342
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,151
Can't say I'm proud of
what our sport's become,

343
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:42,385
but that's the game.

344
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:44,055
Call it whatever you want.

345
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:46,691
Sounds to me like
you just trying to get paid.

346
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:48,360
The money is a side effect.

347
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:53,630
"The Rumble in the Jungle"
didn't just manifest itself.

348
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,565
Somebody had to
make it happen.

349
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,300
Will it into existence.

350
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,203
Oh, yeah, that's supposed
to be you, huh?

351
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,645
You see anybody else standing
here with a care in their heart?

352
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:05,243
I want the same thing
you want.

353
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:06,879
Yeah? What's that?

354
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:11,581
In the history of boxing,

355
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,417
there have been
77 heavyweight champions.

356
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,687
You know that?

357
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,690
But how many
do you think they know?

358
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:21,059
Four?

359
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:22,828
Five?

360
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:28,965
The belt ain't enough.

361
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:31,470
You need a narrative. Something
that sticks to the ribs.

362
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:36,239
Your dad, he knew that.

363
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,910
Do yourself a favor, brah,

364
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,411
and quit while you ahead.

365
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:42,581
Self-preservation.

366
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,384
At least you got that
over your old man.

367
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:52,623
That must be Rocky
whispering in your ear.

368
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:01,833
I'm serious.

369
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:04,968
Amazing voice.

370
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,070
Yo, thank you,
Fillmore.

371
00:29:07,072 --> 00:29:08,973
For real though, thank you.

372
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:23,185
How you doing, kid?

373
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:24,655
We gotta talk.

374
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:28,492
Let's take a walk
and get some air.

375
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,597
Okay? Kind of stuffy in here.

376
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:35,497
Look at that light.

377
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:37,466
That thing's been broken
for a couple of years.

378
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:39,434
It's driving me crazy.

379
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:42,037
City won't fix it or nothing.

380
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,075
What good is a light

381
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:47,408
that don't light, right?

382
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,114
Kind of funny,
but it's stupid, too.

383
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:51,883
Hey.

384
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:54,551
I gotta take the fight.

385
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:02,258
Why?

386
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,059
These dudes killed my pops.

387
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:06,728
Now they're parading around,
talking shit?

388
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,999
I can't let that slide.

389
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:11,835
I'm the champ, right?

390
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:14,236
Yeah.

391
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:15,803
So I ain't got a choice.

392
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:16,806
Choice?

393
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,475
That's the same thing
your father said,

394
00:30:20,477 --> 00:30:23,478
and he died right here,
in my hands.

395
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,713
Look what his choice
put your mother through.

396
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:28,750
You don't wanna really bring all
that stuff up again, do you, kid?

397
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:30,551
I thought you would get it.

398
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:33,488
If I don't take this fight,
I gotta live with it right now.

399
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,424
That kid was raised in hate,
you know what I'm talking about?

400
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:38,326
You weren't. Don't do it.

401
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:39,761
- But you did.
- It's different.

402
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:40,964
It was different?

403
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,700
It's a lot different.

404
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:48,236
I was supposed to be in there
with Drago that night

405
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:50,138
and not your father.

406
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,075
And I could've
thrown in the towel,

407
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,776
but I didn't.

408
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:56,978
And I gotta live with that.

409
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,347
And when I did
get in that ring,

410
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:02,350
that guy broke things in me

411
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:03,920
that ain't never been fixed.

412
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:08,925
It's not worth it.

413
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:11,760
Not at all.

414
00:31:14,297 --> 00:31:16,431
Why do you wanna fight?

415
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,333
What are you talking about?
I just told you why.

416
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,766
No, you didn't, Donnie.

417
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:21,768
Why do you wanna fight?

418
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,637
I get why
they wanna fight you.

419
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:25,038
I know what
they're fighting for.

420
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,141
What about you?

421
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:29,910
Listen to me,
you got everything to lose.

422
00:31:29,912 --> 00:31:31,645
He's got nothing to lose.

423
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:34,081
When a fighter ain't got
nothing to lose, he's dangerous.

424
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,184
I'm dangerous!

425
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,059
You think I'm gonna lose.

426
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:47,229
I didn't say that.

427
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:51,166
Same guy that said he ain't
have enough experience.

428
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,236
- Raw, right?
- Yeah.

429
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:58,438
But you don't think
I could beat him.

430
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,940
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- No.

431
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:01,341
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

432
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,509
I'm saying
I'm not gonna be here forever.

433
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:04,945
And what's that
supposed to mean?

434
00:32:04,947 --> 00:32:06,847
That means you gotta
do some smart thinking.

435
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:08,917
Oh, you wanna talk about
smart decisions, Rock?

436
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:11,952
You in this house all alone.

437
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:13,853
Who been taking
care of you? Me.

438
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:15,290
I've been here for you!

439
00:32:16,758 --> 00:32:18,127
Who else you got?

440
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:25,033
Listen.

441
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,003
I'm taking this fight
with or without you.

442
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:42,884
It's gotta be without.

443
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:45,519
I can't do it.

444
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:46,854
So that's it?

445
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:49,190
You walkin' out on me?

446
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:55,263
At least you ain't gotta worry about
throwing in the towel this time.

447
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:01,568
Yeah.

448
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,673
Yeah.

449
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,571
D, are you okay?

450
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:40,305
Rocky, man.

451
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:41,606
Rocky what?

452
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:43,076
He ain't training me
for the fight.

453
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:46,644
Wait, you're taking the fight?

454
00:33:46,646 --> 00:33:48,313
All the shit
that we've been through.

455
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,982
He gonna leave me high and dry.
That's bullshit!

456
00:33:50,984 --> 00:33:52,851
I took care of him
when he had cancer.

457
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:54,486
He could've been dead, B.

458
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:56,221
I'm sure he has his reasons.

459
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:57,290
Oh, yeah? Like what?

460
00:33:58,625 --> 00:33:59,826
Like what?

461
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:05,298
I don't need him.

462
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:54,146
Yo.

463
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:00,252
I love it.

464
00:35:00,786 --> 00:35:02,252
Me, too.

465
00:35:02,254 --> 00:35:05,822
I want just a little piece
of that room for a studio.

466
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:07,259
That works. It's all you.

467
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:10,861
What's wrong?

468
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:12,896
I don't know. Maybe I'm just a
little tired from the flight.

469
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:13,964
I'm okay.

470
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,265
We don't have to go out.

471
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,935
We can just stay in,
order some food.

472
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:21,806
Hmm. No, baby,
you have to tell her.

473
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:33,718
So, how's the music?

474
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,288
Oh, Donnie didn't tell you?

475
00:35:38,457 --> 00:35:39,458
D?

476
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:42,160
Uh... I forgot.

477
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:45,331
Oh. Yeah, I signed.

478
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:48,164
Hello.

479
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,999
Yeah, it's great. The record label
really hit the ground running, too.

480
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:51,602
I'm up for festivals
this summer.

481
00:35:52,971 --> 00:35:54,538
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

482
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:04,315
So, how's Rocky?

483
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,949
He didn't wanna make the trip?

484
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:09,387
Nah, Ma, you know how he is

485
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:11,522
with the traveling.

486
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:25,470
Okay, Ma.

487
00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:29,572
I'm sure you already
guessed it, but...

488
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:30,774
Oh, yeah.

489
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:32,809
I already know.

490
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:38,048
All the salt,

491
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:40,784
shiny hair,

492
00:36:41,818 --> 00:36:43,488
glowing skin.

493
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,525
How far along are you?

494
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,293
Mmm?

495
00:36:51,629 --> 00:36:52,896
Ma, you think...

496
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:54,563
You think...

497
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:56,398
Uh-uh.

498
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,401
No.

499
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,801
We couldn't even... No.

500
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,202
Your mamma's got jokes, okay.

501
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,574
No, I'm not.

502
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,807
All right.

503
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,177
Mmm-mmm.

504
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:18,320
- What's it say?
- D, don't touch it.

505
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:20,355
No, I don't care if you peed on it.
I just want to see...

506
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:21,925
I don't want you
to mess it up.

507
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:25,562
What's it say?

508
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:29,830
It's two blue lines.

509
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:33,501
Two blue lines?
What does that mean?

510
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:34,937
Two blue lines.

511
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,545
Maybe it's broke.

512
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:55,757
That's crazy.

513
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:57,126
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:00,262
Hell, I don't know, D.

515
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:04,467
Baby, I don't know.

516
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,239
You did say you always
wanted kids, right?

517
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:13,876
Yeah, but I didn't say
so soon.

518
00:38:17,113 --> 00:38:18,612
I don't know if I'm...

519
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:22,084
If we are ready.

520
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:35,297
Let's get ready, then.

521
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:40,636
Yeah.

522
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,810
<i>Did she tell her family yet?</i>

523
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:53,079
She's, uh, on the phone
with her aunt right now.

524
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,449
Oh, that Bianca's a good one.

525
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:58,421
Why she agreed to marry you,
I do not know.

526
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,623
I don't know either.

527
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,095
Oh, it's good
to have you home.

528
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,265
Ma, um...

529
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,170
That fight

530
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,473
between me

531
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:21,609
and Ivan Drago's son...

532
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:27,115
I'm gonna take it.

533
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:29,317
Okay.

534
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,221
That's it?

535
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:36,756
What else is there to say?

536
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:38,090
So, that doesn't bother you?

537
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:39,661
Oh, you think
this doesn't bother me?

538
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:42,895
You're a grown man.

539
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:45,898
It doesn't matter
what I or anyone else thinks.

540
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,701
You wanna fight this man,
that's your business.

541
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:50,538
You don't need my blessings.

542
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:54,139
You clearly
don't have Rocky's.

543
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,510
Rocky don't get it.

544
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,413
It wasn't his dad.

545
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,517
It changed my life.

546
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,517
Your life.

547
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,017
You're telling me
you don't miss him?

548
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,954
Excuse me!

549
00:40:07,956 --> 00:40:09,454
Do not try to make this
about me.

550
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:12,290
And don't pretend
that it's about your father.

551
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:14,927
You became the world champion
without him.

552
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:18,163
Then why don't I feel like it?

553
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,735
If your father was here, he would tell
you he didn't feel like it either.

554
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:24,104
But he's not.

555
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:30,410
I just hope
you'll be here for your child.

556
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,752
Why are you so stupid?

557
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:44,222
Stop.

558
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,591
D, you're tickling me
with that fake beard.

559
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,127
The disrespect.

560
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,099
Why don't you sing for us?

561
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:57,636
No, I am not your jukebox.

562
00:40:57,638 --> 00:41:00,337
I'm not gonna be walking around
here, barefoot and pregnant,

563
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:01,873
making you sandwiches either.

564
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,876
Did you hear that?
No sandwiches, no singing.

565
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:08,345
Your mamma just hating on us.

566
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:09,783
Did you hear that?

567
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,421
What if the baby can't, D?

568
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,190
Can't what?

569
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:20,126
Can't hear.

570
00:41:23,095 --> 00:41:25,131
You know it can be
hereditary, right?

571
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:31,170
Mmm.

572
00:41:32,371 --> 00:41:34,340
Everything is gonna be fine.

573
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,076
I promise.

574
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:03,801
<i>People are gonna
be all over this fight.</i>

575
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:06,572
It got a lot
of bad history, man.

576
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:09,006
Everything.

577
00:42:09,008 --> 00:42:10,206
Your dad.

578
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,544
And yours, too.

579
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:14,279
Don't forget
that he trained him.

580
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:18,314
I know why you didn't
train me before.

581
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,850
I wasn't ready.

582
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:21,484
You was right.

583
00:42:21,486 --> 00:42:23,588
Yeah, but this is different.

584
00:42:26,058 --> 00:42:27,827
<i>Drago's kid...</i>

585
00:42:28,794 --> 00:42:30,328
<i>Big.</i>

586
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:33,563
<i>Fast.</i>

587
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:34,599
Strong.

588
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,568
Unorthodox.

589
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:41,406
<i>He's a monster, boy.</i>

590
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,876
It's a balanced breakfast
over there.

591
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:48,911
You think you ready
for all that?

592
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,148
I gotta be.

593
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,687
But if you ain't gonna
do it for me,

594
00:42:57,756 --> 00:42:58,890
at least do it for them.

595
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:06,228
Think about it.

596
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,731
<i>Beat what they couldn't beat.</i>

597
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,668
<i>Change the way
they were remembered.</i>

598
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:16,574
This is our chance
to rewrite history.

599
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:22,546
<i>Our history.</i>

600
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:37,093
<i>His record might
be light, but, believe me,</i>

601
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:39,394
<i>he ain't no undercard.</i>

602
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:41,498
So, you gotta be with me.

603
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:44,368
I'm right here.

604
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:49,339
We'll see.

605
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:56,580
We'll see.

606
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:31,412
<i>Creed versus Drago.</i>

607
00:44:31,414 --> 00:44:33,314
<i>That means something.</i>

608
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:36,550
<i>Did that factor into your
decision to take this fight?</i>

609
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:39,054
I mean, you can't say Creed
without Drago, right?

610
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:41,422
This is what y'all want.

611
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:43,491
It's what everyone wants.

612
00:44:43,493 --> 00:44:45,292
<i>Also, can't help
but to notice,</i>

613
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:48,662
<i>who won't be in your corner
this time around.</i>

614
00:44:48,664 --> 00:44:50,498
<i>Rocky's taking
some family time.</i>

615
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,167
<i>But Duke's got me.</i>

616
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:53,901
<i>His father taught my father
everything he knows.</i>

617
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:56,070
Speed, D.
That's how we gonna beat him.

618
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:58,173
<i>Technique, speed...</i>

619
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:02,009
<i>I'm confident he'll have me
ready for this fight.</i>

620
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:05,679
<i>And knowing what happened
between your father and Drago,</i>

621
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:08,082
<i>you must have some worry.</i>

622
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,986
What would I be afraid of?

623
00:45:11,654 --> 00:45:13,353
I'm a fighter.
This is what I do, right?

624
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:14,922
Who the champ?

625
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,389
It's who I am.

626
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:18,795
Looking good!

627
00:45:46,388 --> 00:45:48,456
Creed! Creed! Creed!

628
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:06,341
You're much smaller
than your father.

629
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:09,409
Don't you talk about my pop.

630
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:15,081
Hey, we could do this
right here, bro.

631
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:16,182
- Step up here!
- D!

632
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:17,650
He can't help you no more!

633
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:19,219
You hear me? He can't help
behind that ring!

634
00:46:19,221 --> 00:46:21,422
You stand there. All you're
doing is talking, homie.

635
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,924
Your pops can't protect you,
you feel me?

636
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:27,660
Don't talk about my father!
Don't turn your back on me!

637
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:29,563
You in my house, homie!

638
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:56,227
Make sure they hold them down.
We're in the dressing room.

639
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,127
<i>Jim Lampley here,
along with Roy Jones.</i>

640
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:04,429
<i>We're moments away
from tonight's main event.</i>

641
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:07,132
<i>Jim, I would have never
thought in a million years</i>

642
00:47:07,134 --> 00:47:10,102
I'd witness another
Creed versus Drago fight.

643
00:47:10,104 --> 00:47:13,071
Well, get ready, Roy.
Drago makes his way to the ring.

644
00:47:13,073 --> 00:47:16,642
His father leads the way
through the hostile crowd.

645
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:18,810
You can feel the energy.
I'm sure Creed does.

646
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:21,713
He has a big advantage
with the fans in his corner.

647
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:30,923
Stay focused. You're
at home, baby. Focus is the key.

648
00:47:30,925 --> 00:47:33,058
Given Drago's size
and style,

649
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,128
he'll look to use his power
to counter Creed's speed.

650
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,695
Remember why
we're here, man.

651
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:50,476
I'm the champ.

652
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,714
I'm the champ.

653
00:47:58,252 --> 00:47:59,750
I'm the champ.

654
00:48:48,368 --> 00:48:51,634
Adonis Creed making
a grand entrance tonight.

655
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:54,472
Like his father,
Creed is ever the showman,

656
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:56,042
and is energizing the crowd.

657
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:06,649
Creed is letting Drago know
exactly who this arena belongs to.

658
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:09,085
It all feels
so Shakespearean.

659
00:49:09,087 --> 00:49:14,826
Two sons, raised a world apart,
yet inexorably linked by tragedy.

660
00:49:19,564 --> 00:49:21,031
Now, gentlemen,

661
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:23,066
I went over the rules
in the dressing room.

662
00:49:23,068 --> 00:49:26,403
<i>I wanna caution you to keep
this fight clean at all times.</i>

663
00:49:26,405 --> 00:49:28,338
<i>Protect yourself at all times.</i>

664
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,540
<i>And what I say, you must obey.</i>

665
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:32,844
Good luck. Touch gloves.

666
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:39,581
Touch gloves.

667
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,052
Creed fights without
longtime trainer Rocky Balboa.

668
00:49:42,054 --> 00:49:44,320
Interesting to see
how Duke manages the corner

669
00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:46,456
with so much bad blood
between the fighters.

670
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,924
Look at him.

671
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:49,625
He think he gonna run
straight through you.

672
00:49:49,627 --> 00:49:50,927
- You show him what's up.
- Yeah.

673
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:53,997
This is your house, all right?

674
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:56,667
- It's my house.
- Let's go, baby.

675
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,211
Box!

676
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,845
And we're underway.

677
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:11,481
If all goes according to form,

678
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:14,116
Creed is seen as the more
versatile boxer, quicker...

679
00:50:14,118 --> 00:50:15,751
Yeah, baby, throw that jab!
Let it rip!

680
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:18,153
Drago is trying to land
something big.

681
00:50:18,155 --> 00:50:19,456
Dig, dig.

682
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:20,758
Downstairs.

683
00:50:22,827 --> 00:50:24,662
Creed connects
with a couple of body shots.

684
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,100
And a right hand upstairs
for Creed.

685
00:50:31,102 --> 00:50:33,735
Drago hasn't thrown
a meaningful punch yet.

686
00:50:33,737 --> 00:50:35,739
And another right hand
for Creed.

687
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:41,477
Creed blocked that punch

688
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:43,846
and still it knocked him back
into the ropes.

689
00:50:43,848 --> 00:50:45,080
Yeah, we good.

690
00:50:45,082 --> 00:50:47,116
Creed doesn't
like that, Jim.

691
00:50:47,118 --> 00:50:49,384
Don't be stupid, kid.
He's baiting you.

692
00:50:49,386 --> 00:50:52,266
Creed pressing now, angrily rushes
forward with a volley of punches.

693
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,291
He's pulling you in.

694
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,658
A huge left hook
by Drago!

695
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,495
- Come on, kid.
<i>- Creed shaken up by that punch.</i>

696
00:50:59,497 --> 00:51:00,928
Clear your head.

697
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,331
Creed commands
the center of the ring,

698
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:03,931
but there's a hard body shot
to the ribs.

699
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:05,300
And another one
on the other side.

700
00:51:05,302 --> 00:51:08,070
What you doing, baby?
What you doing, D?

701
00:51:08,072 --> 00:51:12,241
And a right hand by Drago
that knocks Creed's head back.

702
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:14,610
Creed can feel the power
behind those punches.

703
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,345
And now
Drago is on the attack.

704
00:51:16,347 --> 00:51:18,045
Jab out, jab out, jab out.
Hands up, let's go!

705
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:20,284
Drago's stalking him
along the ropes.

706
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,752
Get off the ropes, D!

707
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:25,422
Out the corner!

708
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:29,259
No, D! Out the corner,
out the corner!

709
00:51:34,197 --> 00:51:37,899
Hard right hand by Drago,
and Creed is shaken

710
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:40,401
as the first round
comes to a close.

711
00:51:40,403 --> 00:51:43,104
I think most watching at home
are a little surprised

712
00:51:43,106 --> 00:51:45,673
by how impressive
Viktor Drago has looked

713
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:49,477
in these opening minutes
of the fight.

714
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:52,046
<i>With the history these men share,</i>

715
00:51:52,048 --> 00:51:54,015
<i>Duke may have his hands full
keeping Creed</i>

716
00:51:54,017 --> 00:51:56,551
<i>from letting his emotions
get the best of him.</i>

717
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:58,319
What you doing, D?

718
00:51:58,321 --> 00:52:00,488
- You need to stick with the game plan.
- I know, I know.

719
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,523
Stay off the line. Take your angles.
You ain't taking your angles.

720
00:52:02,525 --> 00:52:03,690
I know!

721
00:52:03,692 --> 00:52:04,992
If he throws you
a left hook...

722
00:52:04,994 --> 00:52:06,661
Come on, man,
hold the phone on that.

723
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:08,362
- You think I don't know that shit?
- Well, if you know it,

724
00:52:08,364 --> 00:52:09,465
do it!

725
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:29,816
And now, as we prepare for round
two, this crowd is still buzzing

726
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:34,455
from the vicious rally that Drago
brought forth in the last minute

727
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:36,356
of round number one.

728
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:38,058
Come out smart.

729
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,660
Got Creed in serious trouble
as the round came to a close.

730
00:52:39,662 --> 00:52:40,927
Box!

731
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,429
And now,
round two begins.

732
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:46,435
And Drago comes out throwing,
wasting no time.

733
00:52:51,473 --> 00:52:53,306
- Get off the ropes!
- And Creed is backed

734
00:52:53,308 --> 00:52:55,844
into the ropes, trying to
avoid those power shots.

735
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,412
Damn.

736
00:52:59,414 --> 00:53:01,383
Things just got
ugly fast.

737
00:53:03,986 --> 00:53:08,357
And another hard right hand shot,
and Creed is in big trouble now.

738
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:10,891
Keep moving, Donnie.

739
00:53:15,297 --> 00:53:18,198
A massive right hand
sends Creed reeling.

740
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,165
He tries to regain
his footing.

741
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,967
Creed trying to answer back.

742
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:26,107
And now a huge hook sends
Creed flying through the ropes!

743
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:28,276
Come on, kid.

744
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:35,682
Two!

745
00:53:35,684 --> 00:53:36,782
Three!

746
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:37,950
Four!

747
00:53:37,952 --> 00:53:40,019
Five! Six!

748
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:41,287
That's it,
that's it, that's it.

749
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:42,589
Creed! Creed!

750
00:53:42,591 --> 00:53:44,425
- You okay?
- Yeah.

751
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:48,093
Box!

752
00:53:48,095 --> 00:53:49,361
Creed needs something

753
00:53:49,363 --> 00:53:50,764
to try to turn
this fight around.

754
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:54,400
Drago just keeps coming.

755
00:53:54,402 --> 00:53:56,835
What a big rib shot!

756
00:53:56,837 --> 00:53:58,537
Shit.

757
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,272
Those were two tremendous
right hands to the rib cage.

758
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:02,809
You could've heard that one
in the nosebleed seats.

759
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,185
Creed clearly in pain,
as he finds a way to his feet.

760
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:15,054
Not ready to give up yet.

761
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:17,124
I don't know. This
is getting dangerous, Jim.

762
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:22,294
Okay! Come to me!

763
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:24,463
And now, Bayless is
gonna let him go again.

764
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,466
Ready?

765
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:27,466
Box!

766
00:54:27,468 --> 00:54:29,934
He comes barreling
out of the corner.

767
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:31,637
Huge right hook!

768
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,304
Drago trying to end it.

769
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:36,874
And Creed delivers
a big right hand at the bell.

770
00:54:36,876 --> 00:54:38,577
Get back!
Get back to your corner!

771
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,612
Bayless restraining
Drago, seemingly frustrated...

772
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:42,013
Obey my commands.

773
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:44,550
...as he was close
to finishing the fight.

774
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:47,554
You got to show me something.
If not, I'm gonna stop it.

775
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:51,889
Can you fight?

776
00:54:51,891 --> 00:54:53,858
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

777
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,194
Hell no.
I'm calling this fight.

778
00:54:56,196 --> 00:54:57,562
Nigga, don't call this shit.

779
00:54:57,564 --> 00:54:59,330
You ain't got to prove shit
to nobody.

780
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:02,467
Look at you. Your ribs
look like they broke.

781
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:05,305
You can't
call this fight.

782
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:27,558
Hand me
my mouthpiece.

783
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,332
My mouthpiece.

784
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:43,976
Don't do it.

785
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:46,677
Now, as we go
to round three,

786
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:49,680
Adonis Creed has been
beaten up and bloodied

787
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:52,015
by an avalanche of power shots

788
00:55:52,017 --> 00:55:54,317
from Viktor Drago
in the first two rounds.

789
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,154
And we'll see how much
Adonis Creed has left now,

790
00:55:57,156 --> 00:55:58,723
as he tries to stay alive
in the fight.

791
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:00,290
Stop the fight.

792
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:02,092
Dangerous swings
from Drago

793
00:56:02,094 --> 00:56:04,694
as Creed desperately tries
to hold him off.

794
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:07,299
Drago's still putting
huge pressure on the body.

795
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,200
Come on, stop the fight!

796
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:12,335
And another shot
by Drago!

797
00:56:12,337 --> 00:56:14,171
Creed seemingly
on his last legs!

798
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:16,074
- Drago on the attack.
- Come on, D!

799
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,111
Oh, and with a devastating
shot to the rib cage.

800
00:56:21,113 --> 00:56:22,414
Stop! Stop!

801
00:56:57,683 --> 00:57:01,417
This is an obvious
disqualification, or so it would appear

802
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:03,385
because Creed was fully down

803
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,488
at the moment that Drago
landed that last shot.

804
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,256
- No!
- You wanna kill somebody?

805
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:09,558
- No way, baby. No!
- Easy, easy!

806
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,327
- No. No, no, no!
- Come on.

807
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:13,331
No! Just relax.

808
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,914
<i>This arena is
completely silent</i>

809
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,316
<i>as the audience waits to see</i>

810
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,255
<i>what will be the condition
of young Adonis Creed.</i>

811
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,979
Cracked orbital bone, two
cracked ribs, grade-3 concussion,

812
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,749
ruptured kidney,
numerous contusions.

813
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:08,051
Oh...

814
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,351
A ruptured kidney, is that...

815
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,053
His injuries will heal
with rest and time,

816
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,821
including the kidney.

817
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,025
Now, we shouldn't have
to resort to surgery,

818
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:18,393
but we will need to keep him here for
at least 48 hours, as a precaution.

819
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:23,064
Now he's still numb from the morphine,
but he'll certainly feel it later.

820
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,266
- Okay.
- You okay?

821
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,671
Fine, I just gotta sit.

822
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,739
If you're expecting...

823
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,106
No, I'm fine.

824
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:36,211
No, no, seriously.
Take it easy, okay?

825
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,514
Excuse me, Dr. Ewell.

826
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,786
You have a visitor.
Right this way.

827
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,192
Bianca.

828
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:54,094
Listen, I'm so sorry
everything went...

829
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:56,098
I should've been there.

830
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,367
I'm so sorry.

831
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,969
I am.

832
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,135
Me, too.

833
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:04,139
Is it okay if I see him?

834
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,910
What difference do it
make to us? We saw what happened.

835
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,713
They doing what they supposed
to be doing.

836
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,248
I don't care.

837
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,950
Right. Okay.

838
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,219
Got it.

839
00:59:26,428 --> 00:59:29,630
WBC's not gonna contest
the referee's decision,

840
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:33,636
so Viktor
remains disqualified.

841
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:36,338
Bottom line,

842
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:39,072
you still the champ.

843
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,409
I'm gonna let you rest, man.

844
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,946
So, if you need something,
you know, I'm outside.

845
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:55,456
Got some company, D.

846
01:00:13,675 --> 01:00:15,641
You did good.

847
01:00:15,643 --> 01:00:17,178
We tried.

848
01:00:27,922 --> 01:00:31,857
You know, I watched you
back in Philadelphia.

849
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:35,394
You showed a ton of heart.
I mean, there's no doubt about it.

850
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:37,532
- Showed a ton of heart.
- Heart?

851
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,867
Man, I ain't trying
to hear that shit.

852
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:44,303
D. It's Rock.

853
01:00:44,305 --> 01:00:45,538
Oh, it's okay.
It's all right.

854
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,873
No, you guys gotta
work it out.

855
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,912
I lost the fight
before it even started, right?

856
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:54,980
No. No, no.

857
01:00:54,982 --> 01:00:57,817
This guy was...
He's a big guy, he's strong.

858
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,685
He got the reach on you.
He got all kinds of...

859
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:01,589
Oh, now you're trying
to train me?

860
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:06,226
Be my coach?

861
01:01:07,695 --> 01:01:10,564
No, look at me.

862
01:01:12,734 --> 01:01:14,267
Look at me.

863
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:20,875
What are you still doing here?

864
01:01:23,177 --> 01:01:25,211
Here to pick up the pieces?

865
01:01:25,213 --> 01:01:27,113
No.

866
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:31,117
Shouldn't you be in Philly?

867
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,819
- Adonis.
- No, it's okay.

868
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,590
I don't want him to get all...

869
01:01:37,924 --> 01:01:40,660
Take care of each other.

870
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:44,397
I'm sorry.

871
01:01:58,779 --> 01:02:00,279
Baby.

872
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:05,819
He loves you, D.

873
01:02:09,156 --> 01:02:10,690
Look at me.

874
01:02:12,893 --> 01:02:14,793
I'm looking
right at you, babe.

875
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:17,898
How's that baby
gonna look at me?

876
01:03:13,052 --> 01:03:14,785
Adonis, do you really
feel like a champ?

877
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:16,954
Do you think you deserve
to keep the belt?

878
01:03:16,956 --> 01:03:18,588
Why would you take
that fight, Adonis?

879
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,525
Is this it
for Adonis Creed?

880
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:34,238
I'm cool. I'm cool.

881
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,408
- D, please, let me help you, baby.
- I said I can walk.

882
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,714
- Please sit...
- I said I got it.

883
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:35,033
I don't know.
Lately, it's like...

884
01:04:36,466 --> 01:04:39,302
He hasn't really been himself.

885
01:04:39,304 --> 01:04:42,405
And I get it.

886
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:45,774
'Cause he's going
through a lot.

887
01:04:45,776 --> 01:04:48,944
<i>He's just starting
physical therapy.</i>

888
01:04:48,946 --> 01:04:51,081
<i>Trying to get himself right.</i>

889
01:04:51,982 --> 01:04:53,150
<i>And</i>

890
01:04:54,451 --> 01:04:55,919
<i>he's, uh...</i>

891
01:04:56,887 --> 01:04:57,988
<i>distant</i>

892
01:04:59,323 --> 01:05:02,192
<i>and disconnected.</i>

893
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,463
It's like nothing really
matters to him right now.

894
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,732
Including me.

895
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:11,068
Which is new.

896
01:05:14,204 --> 01:05:16,438
<i>Yeah.</i>

897
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,811
<i>Listen, be there
for him, take care of him,</i>

898
01:05:21,712 --> 01:05:24,045
<i>give him your love.</i>

899
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:26,948
<i>But also, you gotta realize
he's in a place right now</i>

900
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,017
<i>that only he can
get himself out of.</i>

901
01:05:29,019 --> 01:05:30,718
And with everything
he's going through...

902
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,187
With everything
he's going through?

903
01:05:32,189 --> 01:05:34,724
You've been in his corner
every step of the way.

904
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,096
<i>He's a grown man.</i>

905
01:05:42,631 --> 01:05:45,400
<i>He's gotta heal
from the inside out.</i>

906
01:05:45,402 --> 01:05:48,271
Trust me, I know.
I've been there.

907
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:50,173
Mmm.

908
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:35,850
Feel her?

909
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:39,353
Yeah.

910
01:06:39,355 --> 01:06:41,854
<i>Highlights of Drago
silencing critics tonight</i>

911
01:06:41,856 --> 01:06:44,924
<i>with a devastating first round
knockout of Anthony Novak.</i>

912
01:06:44,926 --> 01:06:47,394
<i>Here's a post-fight interview
with Max Kellerman.</i>

913
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:49,163
<i>Viktor, here we are
just months</i>

914
01:06:49,165 --> 01:06:51,398
<i>since your controversial loss
to Adonis Creed.</i>

915
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,233
<i>How does this win feel?</i>

916
01:06:53,235 --> 01:06:54,801
<i>What loss?</i>

917
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,370
<i>Excuse me.</i>

918
01:06:56,372 --> 01:06:58,771
<i>From your disqualification
to Adonis Creed.</i>

919
01:06:58,773 --> 01:07:01,308
<i>But how does this
feel to you tonight?</i>

920
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:04,277
<i>I don't care.
Creed must fight me.</i>

921
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:06,413
<i>And if he
doesn't fight you?</i>

922
01:07:06,415 --> 01:07:08,347
<i>Then he's no champion.</i>

923
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:11,584
<i>There you have it, Adonis.
Challenge is on the table.</i>

924
01:09:08,569 --> 01:09:10,002
Viktor!

925
01:10:09,428 --> 01:10:10,994
What's good?

926
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:13,096
Just maintaining, man.
Long time no see, what's up?

927
01:10:13,098 --> 01:10:18,801
Nothing, man. Just been caught up.
You know, the house, the baby.

928
01:10:18,803 --> 01:10:19,936
You know how it is.

929
01:10:19,938 --> 01:10:22,038
Yeah? How Bianca doing?

930
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,941
She's good. She's good.

931
01:10:24,943 --> 01:10:28,044
Good, good, good.

932
01:10:28,046 --> 01:10:31,481
Listen, man, I've been meaning
to hit you up, though.

933
01:10:31,483 --> 01:10:34,517
Commissioner wanna know
who we plan to fight next.

934
01:10:34,519 --> 01:10:36,586
You ain't gotta fight Drago,

935
01:10:36,588 --> 01:10:39,155
but you gotta fight someone.

936
01:10:39,157 --> 01:10:41,924
You gotta defend the belt.

937
01:10:41,926 --> 01:10:44,129
Otherwise,
it's gonna be vacated.

938
01:10:46,398 --> 01:10:49,934
I could set up a little, you
know, tune-up fight, kind of.

939
01:10:56,675 --> 01:10:58,040
No. You know what, man?

940
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,108
Don't worry about
none of that right now.

941
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,711
Listen, just come on inside.

942
01:11:01,713 --> 01:11:03,881
Hit the bag, man, warm up.

943
01:11:04,716 --> 01:11:06,649
Yeah.

944
01:11:06,651 --> 01:11:09,387
Yeah, I'm gonna grab my stuff,
and I'm gonna meet you in there.

945
01:11:11,922 --> 01:11:13,591
All right, man.

946
01:11:23,535 --> 01:11:25,668
Put your body weight
into that glove.

947
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,539
There you go. Lean in it.

948
01:11:39,116 --> 01:11:41,952
Yeah, I called you,
like, a thousand times.

949
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,988
Yeah, it's about the light.

950
01:11:45,956 --> 01:11:47,289
How long?

951
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,791
You want to be specific?
Couple years.

952
01:11:49,793 --> 01:11:51,526
Yeah.

953
01:11:51,528 --> 01:11:54,031
I mean, how many guys does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

954
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,368
I'm not joking.

955
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:01,236
Can I call you guys back?

956
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:02,406
Yeah.

957
01:12:17,721 --> 01:12:18,921
Wow.

958
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:43,279
Hey, Ma.

959
01:12:45,281 --> 01:12:46,416
Ma.

960
01:12:59,961 --> 01:13:01,197
Hey, Ma.

961
01:13:04,933 --> 01:13:06,369
How you doing, kid?

962
01:13:08,069 --> 01:13:09,637
What are you doing here?

963
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:11,505
I hope you don't mind,

964
01:13:11,507 --> 01:13:14,644
your mom asked if I would come out
'cause she's worried about you.

965
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:19,314
I am, too.

966
01:13:19,749 --> 01:13:21,249
I'm good.

967
01:13:23,519 --> 01:13:25,419
You didn't have to come
all this way.

968
01:13:25,421 --> 01:13:27,220
By train.

969
01:13:27,222 --> 01:13:30,791
Three days
on a train.

970
01:13:30,793 --> 01:13:33,159
It's all right, you know,
gives you time to think.

971
01:13:33,161 --> 01:13:37,964
And you watch all these places
whipping by the windows like postcards.

972
01:13:37,966 --> 01:13:39,934
It's quite an experience.

973
01:13:39,936 --> 01:13:42,202
Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

974
01:13:42,204 --> 01:13:44,072
Yeah, it was nice.

975
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,639
This is wonderful.

976
01:13:46,641 --> 01:13:50,212
How you have
all this out here.

977
01:13:51,079 --> 01:13:53,881
You could have the same.

978
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:55,615
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

979
01:13:55,617 --> 01:13:59,118
I mean,
not just the shiny stuff,

980
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,689
but the better stuff.

981
01:14:02,824 --> 01:14:04,259
Have a better life.

982
01:14:07,863 --> 01:14:09,631
Be a better man.

983
01:14:11,733 --> 01:14:15,200
You know, I was thinking about
what you were saying about

984
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:19,073
what smart decisions
have I made lately.

985
01:14:22,344 --> 01:14:24,513
Couldn't think of many.

986
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,384
You know, I wasn't even there
when my son's son,

987
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:33,655
my grandson,

988
01:14:34,455 --> 01:14:36,455
was born.

989
01:14:36,457 --> 01:14:40,793
I mean, he's like
that tall now probably.

990
01:14:40,795 --> 01:14:43,732
I don't even know him.
He doesn't know me.

991
01:14:46,968 --> 01:14:48,736
It's pathetic.

992
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:51,772
Well, why won't you just

993
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,440
call him?

994
01:14:55,442 --> 01:14:57,811
It ain't that easy,
you know...

995
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:01,713
Listen,

996
01:15:01,715 --> 01:15:05,817
I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

997
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:07,588
You know what I mean?

998
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:12,426
So, you gotta ask yourself,

999
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,994
what's the valuable stuff?

1000
01:15:15,996 --> 01:15:19,031
It's like I asked you before.

1001
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:21,702
What were you
really fighting for?

1002
01:15:23,904 --> 01:15:25,406
I was afraid.

1003
01:15:28,742 --> 01:15:30,209
Of this.

1004
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:35,181
Expectations.

1005
01:15:36,016 --> 01:15:37,585
Being the champ.

1006
01:15:39,787 --> 01:15:43,189
I was scared I couldn't do
what he couldn't.

1007
01:15:45,558 --> 01:15:46,827
It's weird.

1008
01:15:49,162 --> 01:15:51,531
I used to feel like
he was apart of me.

1009
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,733
Now I can't hear him,
or that thing,

1010
01:15:55,735 --> 01:15:58,769
that thing that tells me
to get in the ring.

1011
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:01,305
Move my feet,
keep my hands up.

1012
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,643
Hit anything
that gets in my way.

1013
01:16:08,015 --> 01:16:09,849
I can't hear it anymore.

1014
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:20,057
I don't even know how I lost.

1015
01:16:20,059 --> 01:16:22,227
Your mind wasn't right.

1016
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:28,568
And your natural style just
won't work with a guy that big.

1017
01:16:36,976 --> 01:16:38,845
You saying yours was better?

1018
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:41,581
I won, didn't I?

1019
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:51,655
- Good seeing you, Unc.
- Great to see you, too.

1020
01:16:51,657 --> 01:16:53,490
I was talking
with your mother,

1021
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:58,963
and she says you came up
with this name for the child.

1022
01:16:58,965 --> 01:17:00,230
- Amara.
- Amara.

1023
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:01,464
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1024
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:03,134
Why, what's wrong with that?

1025
01:17:03,136 --> 01:17:05,635
No, it's a beautiful name,
but it's kind of complicated.

1026
01:17:05,637 --> 01:17:07,337
Why don't you think
about something,

1027
01:17:07,339 --> 01:17:09,539
at least I would,
a little simpler to say,

1028
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:13,009
like "Becky" or "Cate,"
something like that.

1029
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:14,411
Cate Creed?

1030
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,246
Cate Creed. Two "C's."
Easy to remember.

1031
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:18,248
You do know
she's gonna be black, right?

1032
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,250
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1033
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,921
Okay.

1034
01:17:23,855 --> 01:17:25,724
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah.

1035
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:28,960
Wait, right now?

1036
01:17:30,696 --> 01:17:32,529
- Relax.
- Okay.

1037
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:34,964
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Mmm-hmm.

1038
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:38,001
You just gotta be there
for her, okay? That's your job.

1039
01:17:38,003 --> 01:17:39,135
I got you, I got you.

1040
01:17:39,137 --> 01:17:40,804
- And remember...
- Yeah.

1041
01:17:40,806 --> 01:17:44,239
Today is gonna be the best day
of your life. Right here.

1042
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:46,377
- All right?
- Yeah.

1043
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,212
Best day of your life.

1044
01:17:50,214 --> 01:17:53,451
- I'm having a baby.
- I feel like I'm having a baby.

1045
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,854
- Boy!
- Hey.

1046
01:17:57,856 --> 01:17:59,455
- What you doing?
- I know...

1047
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:01,858
No, never mind.
Just get in here.

1048
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,059
Okay. Okay, okay.

1049
01:18:03,061 --> 01:18:05,529
Like I said,
I'll be here if you need me.

1050
01:18:06,564 --> 01:18:08,967
- All right.
- All right.

1051
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:15,804
You know,
I'm gonna do what I can.

1052
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:19,142
You being here
is more than enough.

1053
01:18:19,144 --> 01:18:20,578
Thank you.

1054
01:19:11,294 --> 01:19:12,426
Mr. Balboa?

1055
01:19:12,428 --> 01:19:15,230
- Mmm.
- She's here.

1056
01:19:15,232 --> 01:19:17,000
Oh, that's great.

1057
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:23,404
That's absolutely good.

1058
01:19:23,406 --> 01:19:25,074
That's fantastic.

1059
01:19:31,381 --> 01:19:33,815
Yo!

1060
01:19:33,817 --> 01:19:36,751
Hey, Unc, say hi
to your goddaughter.

1061
01:19:36,753 --> 01:19:39,354
Wow. That's quite an honor.

1062
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:43,257
- Let me see you.
- Here she is.

1063
01:19:43,259 --> 01:19:46,461
Hey, hello, beautiful.

1064
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:48,896
So, nurse...

1065
01:19:48,898 --> 01:19:49,899
Hmm?

1066
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:53,970
...what about the test?

1067
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:57,238
Relax for now.

1068
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,110
We'll run an auditory exam as soon
as you and Amara get some rest.

1069
01:20:03,947 --> 01:20:06,147
It's okay, babe.

1070
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:08,648
Thank God she looks like you.

1071
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:10,119
Yeah, right.

1072
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,858
So, is she gonna
feel anything?

1073
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:21,262
No, it's painless. I promise.

1074
01:20:21,264 --> 01:20:23,097
Okay. Now that
they're in place,

1075
01:20:23,099 --> 01:20:26,066
what we're gonna do is give
her a series of click stimuli

1076
01:20:26,068 --> 01:20:27,500
around 35 decibels

1077
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:29,870
and check her
neural responses.

1078
01:20:29,872 --> 01:20:31,438
Is that loud?

1079
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,108
Normal auditory range.

1080
01:20:35,277 --> 01:20:36,545
Okay.

1081
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:38,447
Here we go.

1082
01:20:40,449 --> 01:20:42,682
So what exactly
are we looking for?

1083
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:44,584
A reading. Spikes.

1084
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:20,320
So, we're not seeing
any waves or spikes, uh,

1085
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:23,089
and given your family history,
there is some cause for concern.

1086
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:25,593
However, it is very early...

1087
01:21:52,219 --> 01:21:54,320
<i>They're gonna run
some more tests.</i>

1088
01:21:54,322 --> 01:21:58,826
They said it's early, and, uh,
sometimes they get false reads.

1089
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:05,199
Let me ask you something.

1090
01:22:07,435 --> 01:22:09,602
What if it ain't okay?

1091
01:22:10,737 --> 01:22:12,106
I can't think like that.

1092
01:22:13,773 --> 01:22:15,742
You gotta, I mean,

1093
01:22:17,178 --> 01:22:18,912
how you gonna handle it?

1094
01:22:19,879 --> 01:22:20,947
Hmm?

1095
01:22:25,453 --> 01:22:26,920
I don't wanna go there.

1096
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:29,921
You gonna love her?

1097
01:22:29,923 --> 01:22:32,623
How you gonna ask me
a question like that, Rock?

1098
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:34,826
- Yeah, I'm gonna love her.
- Good.

1099
01:22:34,828 --> 01:22:37,864
'Cause she ain't feeling
sorry for herself,

1100
01:22:38,698 --> 01:22:40,233
and you shouldn't either.

1101
01:22:49,843 --> 01:22:52,612
You got a little...

1102
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:56,616
Oh, it's boxing gloves.

1103
01:22:57,784 --> 01:22:59,252
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1104
01:23:08,028 --> 01:23:11,262
<i>Goodnight Moon.</i>
I love that book.

1105
01:23:11,264 --> 01:23:13,033
Who's that from, babe?

1106
01:23:15,201 --> 01:23:18,002
<i>The unanimous number
one contender Viktor Drago</i>

1107
01:23:18,004 --> 01:23:20,238
<i>has been met with open arms
back in Russia,</i>

1108
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,473
<i>his father's home,
which is nice.</i>

1109
01:23:22,475 --> 01:23:25,742
<i>But the question on everyone's
mind is, "Where is Creed?"</i>

1110
01:23:25,744 --> 01:23:29,579
<i>If he doesn't choose an opponent
soon, he risks forfeiting the title</i>

1111
01:23:29,581 --> 01:23:33,219
<i>and personally, I can't imagine
him being able to live with that.</i>

1112
01:23:35,654 --> 01:23:37,788
You good?

1113
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:40,759
Yeah.
Finally got her to settle.

1114
01:23:42,061 --> 01:23:45,295
Hey, I need to
get out of the house.

1115
01:23:45,297 --> 01:23:47,831
I was gonna
go over to the studio.

1116
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:50,102
You mind watching her
until I get back?

1117
01:23:50,569 --> 01:23:52,805
Yeah, of course.

1118
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:54,638
Cool.

1119
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,943
Okay, okay.

1120
01:23:58,510 --> 01:23:59,711
Yeah.

1121
01:24:08,554 --> 01:24:09,853
You okay?

1122
01:24:09,855 --> 01:24:12,157
Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

1123
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:14,725
Okay.

1124
01:24:15,693 --> 01:24:17,029
Bye.

1125
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:30,942
Hey.

1126
01:24:35,046 --> 01:24:36,213
Baby.

1127
01:24:36,215 --> 01:24:38,381
Baby, please.

1128
01:24:38,383 --> 01:24:41,617
Hey, you hungry, right?
Hey, baby, you hungry?

1129
01:24:50,228 --> 01:24:52,429
<i>It's Mary Anne.
Please leave a message.</i>

1130
01:24:52,431 --> 01:24:54,498
Hey, Ma. Listen, listen.

1131
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,534
She won't stop crying.
Can you just tell me how to...

1132
01:24:57,536 --> 01:24:59,201
Can you tell me how to
make her stop crying?

1133
01:24:59,203 --> 01:25:01,706
Call me back when you
get this message, okay?

1134
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:36,107
Hey, what's up, baby girl?

1135
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,773
Hey, no.

1136
01:25:38,775 --> 01:25:40,376
It's okay, baby. No, no.

1137
01:25:40,378 --> 01:25:43,013
No, don't cry.
No, not again, please.

1138
01:25:43,548 --> 01:25:44,679
Please.

1139
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,683
No, look, look, look.

1140
01:25:47,884 --> 01:25:49,618
You see that?

1141
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:50,921
Look, look, look.

1142
01:25:52,222 --> 01:25:53,256
Look.

1143
01:26:08,171 --> 01:26:09,839
I'm right here.

1144
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:00,789
I'm sorry.

1145
01:27:02,358 --> 01:27:03,792
I'm sorry.

1146
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,828
I'm sorry.

1147
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:10,866
Hey.
No, no, there you go.

1148
01:27:11,701 --> 01:27:13,300
Hey.

1149
01:27:13,302 --> 01:27:14,403
I know.

1150
01:27:16,305 --> 01:27:19,174
Mmm-hmm. Daddy's
being a bitch, I know.

1151
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:41,230
Hi.

1152
01:27:42,665 --> 01:27:44,300
How'd you do?

1153
01:27:49,505 --> 01:27:51,039
She's a fighter.

1154
01:27:54,476 --> 01:27:56,244
Just like her dad.

1155
01:27:59,682 --> 01:28:01,517
Just like her mom, too.

1156
01:28:11,259 --> 01:28:13,261
I have to fight him again.

1157
01:28:14,663 --> 01:28:17,630
I don't wanna be that person
to stop you.

1158
01:28:17,632 --> 01:28:20,835
But I don't wanna end up
like your mom, alone.

1159
01:28:21,936 --> 01:28:23,269
I feel you.

1160
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:24,272
Do you?

1161
01:28:27,275 --> 01:28:29,675
And it's not
just us anymore, D.

1162
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:33,514
I know it sounds crazy
doing all this all over again.

1163
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:38,384
But this won't be
the end of me.

1164
01:28:38,386 --> 01:28:40,186
Or you.

1165
01:28:40,188 --> 01:28:41,920
It can't be, 'cause we a team.

1166
01:28:41,922 --> 01:28:44,592
We weren't a team when you
took the fight the last time.

1167
01:28:48,396 --> 01:28:49,564
You right.

1168
01:28:50,565 --> 01:28:51,965
I'm sorry.

1169
01:28:55,168 --> 01:28:57,035
I shouldn't have
put you through that.

1170
01:28:57,037 --> 01:28:58,539
Then why?

1171
01:28:59,407 --> 01:29:00,974
Why do it again?

1172
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,242
What do you have to prove?

1173
01:29:04,244 --> 01:29:06,846
It's not about that.

1174
01:29:06,848 --> 01:29:10,450
You wouldn't be any good to anybody
if you didn't do what you love.

1175
01:29:12,185 --> 01:29:15,387
You wouldn't be
able to breathe, right?

1176
01:29:15,389 --> 01:29:19,493
Well, I wouldn't be any good to anybody
if I don't handle this the right way.

1177
01:29:23,997 --> 01:29:25,599
But I need you.

1178
01:29:27,567 --> 01:29:28,969
Both of you.

1179
01:29:37,978 --> 01:29:39,446
I'll beat him.

1180
01:29:46,486 --> 01:29:48,020
You better.

1181
01:29:51,123 --> 01:29:53,660
You gotta think
about this real hard.

1182
01:29:55,127 --> 01:29:57,928
You got people
that need you now.

1183
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:00,365
That's exactly
why I can't lose.

1184
01:30:00,367 --> 01:30:03,233
Buddy said the fight
has to be in Russia.

1185
01:30:03,235 --> 01:30:04,471
Take it or leave it.

1186
01:30:09,743 --> 01:30:11,041
Russia?

1187
01:30:11,043 --> 01:30:12,445
On their turf.

1188
01:30:13,045 --> 01:30:14,413
So Russia it is.

1189
01:30:21,587 --> 01:30:24,188
What you think, Rock?

1190
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:28,459
It's a clear advantage if it
comes down to a judge's decision.

1191
01:30:28,461 --> 01:30:32,565
Well, then we can't let it get
to a judge's decision, right?

1192
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:37,736
Oh, shit.

1193
01:30:39,805 --> 01:30:41,073
Call the promoter.

1194
01:30:46,345 --> 01:30:48,380
So we train here tomorrow,
5:00 a.m.

1195
01:30:49,682 --> 01:30:51,648
No, I got other plans.

1196
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:54,418
- You mean, you wanna go to Philly?
- No.

1197
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:57,488
Listen, you wanna
change things in a big way,

1198
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,725
then you need to make
some big changes.

1199
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,382
You gotta be
messing with me, right?

1200
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:01,286
Heard this is a place
where fighters go,

1201
01:32:02,152 --> 01:32:04,185
you know, to start over.

1202
01:32:04,187 --> 01:32:05,657
Get reborn.

1203
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:11,761
What took y'all so long?

1204
01:32:11,763 --> 01:32:13,194
This some wild shit.

1205
01:32:13,196 --> 01:32:16,064
Yeah, sure looks like
hell to me.

1206
01:32:16,066 --> 01:32:19,671
Since you're going back to hell,
you might as well get used to it.

1207
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:23,775
Let's go.

1208
01:32:36,821 --> 01:32:38,255
Go for it.

1209
01:32:43,193 --> 01:32:44,394
Harder.

1210
01:32:45,929 --> 01:32:47,562
Harder.

1211
01:32:47,564 --> 01:32:48,565
Harder!

1212
01:32:51,001 --> 01:32:52,269
Keep going.

1213
01:33:07,584 --> 01:33:08,619
Build that neck.

1214
01:33:31,742 --> 01:33:32,876
Okay, man up.

1215
01:33:33,877 --> 01:33:35,177
No.

1216
01:33:35,946 --> 01:33:37,213
I'm good.

1217
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:44,153
That's the fight it's gonna be.
Toe-to-toe. Get used to it.

1218
01:33:45,755 --> 01:33:47,388
Box!

1219
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:48,791
Take it to the body.

1220
01:34:01,871 --> 01:34:03,372
Take it! Fight the pain.

1221
01:34:05,074 --> 01:34:06,375
You all right?

1222
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:32,666
Get back in there.

1223
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:34,949
Get back in there. Protect yourself.

1224
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,731
Come on, get up, kid.

1225
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:38,632
Get up.

1226
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:43,570
Keep moving.

1227
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,474
That's it.

1228
01:37:52,865 --> 01:37:54,731
<i>We're just minutes away
from the fight</i>

1229
01:37:54,733 --> 01:37:56,633
<i>the whole world has been
waiting to see.</i>

1230
01:37:56,635 --> 01:37:59,970
The rematch between
Adonis Creed and Viktor Drago

1231
01:37:59,972 --> 01:38:02,206
for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

1232
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:04,041
<i>The unique thing
about this fight, Jim,</i>

1233
01:38:04,043 --> 01:38:09,746
<i>is Adonis Creed comes in
a 25-to-1 underdog,</i>

1234
01:38:09,748 --> 01:38:11,681
<i>and he's the champ!</i>

1235
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:13,516
<i>Well, it's gonna be
fascinating to see</i>

1236
01:38:13,518 --> 01:38:17,120
<i>what that does to Creed's
mindset as he enters the ring.</i>

1237
01:38:17,122 --> 01:38:19,856
<i>Not to mention Drago's.</i>

1238
01:38:19,858 --> 01:38:26,831
Drago! Drago! Drago!

1239
01:39:14,111 --> 01:39:15,811
And there he is.

1240
01:39:15,813 --> 01:39:19,815
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Drago!
Making his way into the arena.

1241
01:39:19,817 --> 01:39:23,652
He does not have the belt,
but to everyone here in Russia

1242
01:39:23,654 --> 01:39:25,455
and to many around the world,

1243
01:39:25,457 --> 01:39:27,858
he is the true
heavyweight champion.

1244
01:40:05,396 --> 01:40:06,863
It's time, kid.

1245
01:40:15,139 --> 01:40:17,638
There was no way Creed
could have run from this fight.

1246
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:21,343
There was such high demand for Adonis
to step back in the ring with Viktor.

1247
01:40:21,345 --> 01:40:26,149
And I'm sure Ivan feels good to
be back home after all these years.

1268
01:42:10,418 --> 01:42:12,053
Come on up, champ.

1269
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:19,459
This is it, Jim.
Creed versus Drago part two.

1270
01:42:19,461 --> 01:42:21,026
Creed looks good tonight,

1271
01:42:21,028 --> 01:42:23,563
but it's impossible to forget
what happened to him

1272
01:42:23,565 --> 01:42:26,499
the last time he stepped
into the ring with Drago.

1273
01:42:26,501 --> 01:42:30,570
Numerous injuries, not least
of all, a nasty broken rib

1274
01:42:30,572 --> 01:42:32,237
and a ruptured kidney.

1275
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,206
A huge difference
in this fight

1276
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:38,110
is he's got former champ Rocky
Balboa back in his corner.

1277
01:42:38,112 --> 01:42:40,045
And Rocky assures everyone

1278
01:42:40,047 --> 01:42:42,983
this fight will be very
different from its predecessor.

1279
01:42:46,655 --> 01:42:51,323
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen. This is it.

1280
01:42:51,325 --> 01:42:53,458
Twelve rounds of boxing

1281
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:58,430
for the heavyweight
championship of the world!

1282
01:42:58,432 --> 01:43:00,499
Ladies and gentlemen,

1283
01:43:00,501 --> 01:43:03,268
let's get ready to rumble!

1284
01:43:06,507 --> 01:43:10,275
You can feel the nervous
energy in the arena tonight, Jim.

1285
01:43:10,277 --> 01:43:13,011
Creed has some courage
to get back into the ring

1286
01:43:13,013 --> 01:43:15,113
with a man who nearly
ended his career.

1287
01:43:15,115 --> 01:43:18,419
A man who is hungry
to be champ.

1288
01:43:24,558 --> 01:43:25,657
Fighters,

1289
01:43:27,026 --> 01:43:28,893
I want good,
clean fight.

1290
01:43:31,164 --> 01:43:33,432
Break when
I tell you to break.

1291
01:43:33,434 --> 01:43:36,535
You go to your corner when I
tell you to go to your corner.

1292
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:44,308
Touch gloves.

1293
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:47,378
Rocky Balboa and Ivan
Drago sharing the ring

1294
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:49,648
for the first time
in 30 years.

1295
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:54,518
If anyone knows how to take on a
slugger like Drago, it would be Rocky.

1296
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,154
You know you got
the fire in your gut,

1297
01:43:57,156 --> 01:44:00,524
and I know you'll do
what needs to be done.

1298
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:05,031
Because now, you know what
you're fighting for.

1299
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:12,836
Viktor overwhelmed
Creed's previous game plan,

1300
01:44:12,838 --> 01:44:14,871
and I think
it got in Adonis' head.

1301
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:18,676
It's gonna be interesting to see
how Rocky Balboa has prepared Creed

1302
01:44:18,678 --> 01:44:21,945
for what is surely to become
an all-out brawl.

1303
01:44:21,947 --> 01:44:23,349
Ready?

1304
01:44:23,849 --> 01:44:25,849
Ready?

1305
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:27,117
Box.

1306
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,952
And we're underway.

1307
01:44:28,954 --> 01:44:32,989
Drago comes out swinging
with two hooks that Creed avoids.

1308
01:44:32,991 --> 01:44:35,125
And a big right-hand
right out of the gate.

1309
01:44:35,127 --> 01:44:36,926
Watch that right, Donnie.

1310
01:44:36,928 --> 01:44:40,332
Drago a bit surprised as
Creed shakes that punch off.

1311
01:44:45,638 --> 01:44:49,141
Drago is pressing hard,
but Creed is not backing off.

1312
01:44:50,509 --> 01:44:52,309
Keep moving, keep moving.

1313
01:44:52,311 --> 01:44:54,513
Creed working a little
bit closer to Drago tonight.

1314
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:00,886
That is a vicious
combination by Creed.

1315
01:45:04,389 --> 01:45:06,890
And now a right hand by Drago.

1316
01:45:06,892 --> 01:45:09,926
Here we go,
Drago applying pressure.

1317
01:45:09,928 --> 01:45:11,328
- Out the corner!
- Come on, Donnie!

1318
01:45:13,465 --> 01:45:15,934
Creed manages
to slip away.

1319
01:45:17,336 --> 01:45:18,337
Let's get it.

1320
01:45:20,172 --> 01:45:22,172
Yeah, what's up?

1321
01:45:22,174 --> 01:45:25,007
Now they're squaring off in
the middle of the ring, toe-to-toe.

1322
01:45:25,009 --> 01:45:26,443
Taking blows.

1323
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:28,511
Creed staying in his face.

1324
01:45:28,513 --> 01:45:30,280
And there's the bell! As a wild
first round comes to an end.

1325
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:31,880
Go to your corner.

1326
01:45:31,882 --> 01:45:33,683
Drago frustrated.

1327
01:45:33,685 --> 01:45:35,318
Creed is looking like a
different fighter tonight, Max.

1328
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,952
- That's it, D! That's it!
- Yes!

1329
01:45:36,954 --> 01:45:38,854
Oh, yeah, who's saying
Drago now, though?

1330
01:45:40,858 --> 01:45:42,692
See, all that work in
the desert paid off, right?

1331
01:45:42,694 --> 01:45:44,394
Yeah, you got him.
You got him thinking.

1332
01:45:44,396 --> 01:45:46,596
He wasn't expecting
what you're bringing.

1333
01:45:46,598 --> 01:45:49,398
Now, he's gonna bring the heat the
next round, but you're ready for it.

1334
01:45:53,672 --> 01:45:55,371
He overextends his right hand.

1335
01:45:55,373 --> 01:45:57,005
You gonna counter
with the right

1336
01:45:57,007 --> 01:45:58,407
and crack him with the left.
You got that?

1337
01:45:58,409 --> 01:46:00,409
Extend the right,
crack him with the left.

1338
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:03,479
He'll never expect it. His old
man did the same thing to me.

1339
01:46:03,481 --> 01:46:05,280
One early observation,
Max.

1340
01:46:05,282 --> 01:46:08,183
I think Creed is withstanding
Drago's combinations

1341
01:46:08,185 --> 01:46:10,319
much better tonight
than in the first fight.

1342
01:46:10,321 --> 01:46:11,687
Box.

1343
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:14,490
And round two begins.

1344
01:46:14,492 --> 01:46:16,660
Drago with a huge left hook.

1345
01:46:19,029 --> 01:46:20,963
And a big right hand.

1346
01:46:20,965 --> 01:46:23,799
Drago on the attack again, now
driving Creed back into the ropes.

1347
01:46:23,801 --> 01:46:26,437
He's overextending the right!
Watch the right!

1348
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:30,541
A right
and a left for Creed.

1349
01:46:42,653 --> 01:46:45,487
Huge uppercut
has Creed holding on now.

1350
01:46:45,489 --> 01:46:47,991
Drago throws him off
into the corner.

1351
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:53,963
- Get out of that corner!
- Get out of the corner!

1352
01:46:56,065 --> 01:46:59,233
And Drago throws Creed
to the canvas.

1353
01:47:02,405 --> 01:47:03,471
What's going on?

1354
01:47:03,473 --> 01:47:05,106
Shades
of the first fight,

1355
01:47:05,108 --> 01:47:07,208
but Drago showing restraint
this time.

1356
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,376
You good?

1357
01:47:08,378 --> 01:47:09,578
Yes, I'm good.

1358
01:47:11,748 --> 01:47:15,049
- Box.
- Drago explodes from the break.

1359
01:47:15,051 --> 01:47:16,317
And Creed is down!

1360
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:18,419
A flurry of heavy shots!

1361
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:21,691
Drago's power
is just incredible.

1362
01:47:23,059 --> 01:47:24,494
Three.

1363
01:47:24,861 --> 01:47:26,394
Four.

1364
01:47:26,396 --> 01:47:28,496
Take the eight count.
Take the full eight.

1365
01:47:28,498 --> 01:47:30,030
Creed taking his time
on the canvas.

1366
01:47:30,032 --> 01:47:31,199
Six.

1367
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:33,201
Stay down! Breathe!

1368
01:47:33,203 --> 01:47:35,636
He's listening to Rocky, who
has been in this situation before.

1369
01:47:35,638 --> 01:47:37,271
Eight.

1370
01:47:37,273 --> 01:47:38,773
And Creed is back on his feet.
Beats the count.

1371
01:47:38,775 --> 01:47:39,874
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

1372
01:47:39,876 --> 01:47:41,275
Box.

1373
01:47:41,277 --> 01:47:42,910
Tie him up. Don't fight him.
Tie him up.

1374
01:47:42,912 --> 01:47:45,348
Drago is right back at it.

1375
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:50,651
So, with the knockdown and
those hard shots at the end,

1376
01:47:50,653 --> 01:47:53,588
that round clearly goes
to Viktor Drago.

1377
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:56,223
And you could just feel
he's gaining momentum.

1378
01:47:56,225 --> 01:47:57,959
You knew this was
gonna be a war, right?

1379
01:47:57,961 --> 01:47:59,326
You knew that going in there.

1380
01:47:59,328 --> 01:48:01,729
From now on,
it's who wants it more,

1381
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:03,196
and who's got more heart.

1382
01:48:06,201 --> 01:48:08,836
Don't let him crack you. You stay on
the outside, you're gonna get hurt.

1383
01:48:08,838 --> 01:48:11,104
You stay on the inside,
you'll tear him up.

1384
01:48:11,106 --> 01:48:12,940
I'm telling you,
it's all about pressure.

1385
01:48:12,942 --> 01:48:16,011
If you wanna give pain, you gotta
be willing to take the pain.

1386
01:48:25,921 --> 01:48:27,389
Come on!

1387
01:48:31,827 --> 01:48:33,095
- Yes!
- Yes!

1388
01:48:37,499 --> 01:48:40,233
Round four
is another brutal display

1389
01:48:40,235 --> 01:48:43,537
as Creed takes a lot of
punishment from Drago.

1390
01:48:44,973 --> 01:48:47,273
Drago is not slowing down.

1391
01:48:47,275 --> 01:48:50,044
Landing a big shot
after the bell.

1392
01:48:51,212 --> 01:48:52,579
What is your problem?

1393
01:48:52,581 --> 01:48:53,682
Yo!

1394
01:48:55,484 --> 01:48:59,285
The violent chess match
continues, Jim.

1395
01:48:59,287 --> 01:49:01,955
Oh, and Creed is down again.

1396
01:49:01,957 --> 01:49:03,990
Donnie, get up.

1397
01:49:03,992 --> 01:49:07,359
Drago clearly dominating this
fight, but Creed will not give up.

1398
01:49:07,361 --> 01:49:08,929
He is taking
a lot of punishment.

1399
01:49:08,931 --> 01:49:10,529
You gotta stay
in his face. Look at me.

1400
01:49:10,531 --> 01:49:12,598
You gotta stay in his face.

1401
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:15,601
And when you see an
opportunity, you go after it.

1402
01:49:19,807 --> 01:49:21,108
There you are!

1403
01:49:24,278 --> 01:49:25,680
Drago is cut now.

1404
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:31,784
As we enter round eight,

1405
01:49:31,786 --> 01:49:34,887
we are deeper into this fight
than anyone expected.

1406
01:49:34,889 --> 01:49:38,392
Creed must sense he's behind.
He's trying to force the action.

1407
01:49:41,127 --> 01:49:42,430
Yes, baby!

1408
01:49:50,871 --> 01:49:53,973
What we are seeing
tonight is Adonis Creed

1409
01:49:53,975 --> 01:49:57,375
standing up to the awesome
power of Viktor Drago.

1410
01:49:57,377 --> 01:49:59,312
He's not going anywhere.

1411
01:50:08,623 --> 01:50:10,923
Viktor Drago
looks tired, Max.

1412
01:50:10,925 --> 01:50:14,427
Keep in mind, he's never had to go past
the 4th round in a professional fight.

1413
01:50:17,664 --> 01:50:20,065
- Hey! What was that?
- Take the point, ref!

1414
01:50:20,067 --> 01:50:21,499
And Drago drops Creed

1415
01:50:21,501 --> 01:50:23,167
- with two nasty body shots.
- Come on!

1416
01:50:23,169 --> 01:50:25,370
- He held him and hit him.
- One.

1417
01:50:25,372 --> 01:50:28,606
Viktor holding and maybe
getting away with something there.

1418
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,675
The ref must not have seen it.

1419
01:50:32,679 --> 01:50:34,278
Come on.

1420
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,481
I think Rocky Balboa has
a decision to make here, Jim.

1421
01:50:36,483 --> 01:50:38,083
He knows better than anyone

1422
01:50:38,085 --> 01:50:41,786
how this same story played out
three decades ago.

1423
01:50:41,788 --> 01:50:43,554
Donnie, Donnie, talk to me.

1424
01:50:43,556 --> 01:50:44,856
Donnie.

1425
01:50:44,858 --> 01:50:46,156
Your ribs?

1426
01:50:46,158 --> 01:50:47,627
You think it's broke?

1427
01:50:57,637 --> 01:50:59,103
What do you wanna do,
Donnie?

1428
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,207
You wanna call it?

1429
01:51:07,013 --> 01:51:08,380
I didn't think so.

1430
01:51:13,419 --> 01:51:14,952
Now he's gonna
come after you,

1431
01:51:14,954 --> 01:51:17,421
and he's gonna try to break
on that rib some more.

1432
01:51:17,423 --> 01:51:18,856
But that's okay.

1433
01:51:18,858 --> 01:51:20,524
'Cause you like the pain.
You can take it.

1434
01:51:20,526 --> 01:51:23,694
You know why?
Because you're dangerous.

1435
01:51:23,696 --> 01:51:25,997
- I'm dangerous.
- That's right.

1436
01:51:25,999 --> 01:51:27,499
Ten seconds out.

1437
01:51:44,616 --> 01:51:46,717
Now here we go
with round ten

1438
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,086
of what has become a war of attrition.

1439
01:51:49,088 --> 01:51:53,523
Drago seemingly ahead on the scorecards,
but Creed refusing to back down.

1440
01:51:53,525 --> 01:51:55,525
That's it, Donnie. Good.

1441
01:51:55,527 --> 01:51:58,462
Creed using whatever
he has left in the tank.

1442
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:00,296
Drago working the body.

1443
01:52:00,298 --> 01:52:01,600
Tie him up!

1444
01:52:06,705 --> 01:52:08,739
And down goes
Creed again.

1445
01:52:08,741 --> 01:52:11,442
And this could be the end of the fight.

1446
01:52:41,106 --> 01:52:42,540
Get up, D.

1447
01:52:54,418 --> 01:52:57,753
No man should be able to
fight through that beating,

1448
01:52:57,755 --> 01:52:59,622
but Adonis Creed
wills himself off the canvas.

1449
01:52:59,624 --> 01:53:01,423
- What's your name?
- Creed.

1450
01:53:01,425 --> 01:53:02,827
What's your name?

1451
01:53:03,326 --> 01:53:04,629
Creed!

1452
01:53:08,132 --> 01:53:09,865
Box!

1453
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:13,235
Adonis Creed knows there
is no way around Viktor Drago.

1454
01:53:13,237 --> 01:53:14,939
He has to go through him.

1455
01:53:16,774 --> 01:53:17,875
Dig!

1456
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:20,142
Dig! Dig!

1457
01:53:20,144 --> 01:53:21,777
Creed suddenly finding
another gear!

1458
01:53:21,779 --> 01:53:22,780
Come on!

1459
01:53:24,081 --> 01:53:26,081
Drago's on his heels.

1460
01:53:30,687 --> 01:53:32,789
And down goes Drago!

1461
01:53:35,092 --> 01:53:36,827
That's it! That's right!

1462
01:53:37,995 --> 01:53:39,830
What a wild turn
of events.

1463
01:53:43,067 --> 01:53:44,732
Two.

1464
01:53:44,734 --> 01:53:46,901
Donnie, he gets up,
you go after him.

1465
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:47,971
Three.

1466
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:50,707
Four.

1467
01:53:52,742 --> 01:53:53,877
Five.

1468
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:57,612
- Six.
- Drago beats the count.

1469
01:53:57,614 --> 01:54:01,918
I can't believe either of
these guys are still on their feet.

1470
01:54:07,057 --> 01:54:08,424
Box.

1471
01:54:12,562 --> 01:54:16,965
Drago seemingly so far ahead on
points, he just needs to stay upright

1472
01:54:16,967 --> 01:54:18,800
and make it to the end.

1473
01:54:18,802 --> 01:54:22,436
Here comes Creed again, driving
Drago back into the ropes.

1474
01:54:22,438 --> 01:54:24,040
- Dig! Dig! Dig!
- Yeah!

1475
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:28,444
Come on, take him down!

1476
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:30,947
Come on, baby.

1477
01:54:34,817 --> 01:54:36,985
And Viktor Drago is down!

1478
01:54:36,987 --> 01:54:38,652
Again!

1479
01:54:38,654 --> 01:54:41,094
What a turn this fight has taken.

1480
01:54:51,567 --> 01:54:53,967
Creed doubled over
in pain

1481
01:54:53,969 --> 01:54:57,006
as Drago tries to
pick himself up off the floor.

1482
01:55:26,567 --> 01:55:30,738
Drago summons the strength,
manages to make the count.

1483
01:55:44,619 --> 01:55:46,986
They're still
swinging, Max.

1484
01:55:46,988 --> 01:55:49,056
Creed continuing
to connect.

1485
01:55:49,058 --> 01:55:51,891
And this is becoming
hard to watch, Jim.

1486
01:55:51,893 --> 01:55:54,328
I don't think Drago
has anything left,

1487
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:56,731
but he refuses to give up.

1488
01:56:20,755 --> 01:56:22,688
And that's it! It's over!

1489
01:56:24,092 --> 01:56:26,125
Drago's corner
throws in the towel.

1490
01:56:26,127 --> 01:56:29,729
And Adonis Creed
defends his title.

1491
01:56:29,731 --> 01:56:31,529
Defends his name.

1492
01:56:31,531 --> 01:56:33,732
Creates his own legacy.

1493
01:56:33,734 --> 01:56:39,038
He is still the heavyweight
champion of the world.

1494
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:44,576
And the Russian crowd is standing
and cheering for the American fighter.

1495
01:56:59,559 --> 01:57:01,494
Where's B at? Where's B?

1496
01:57:01,496 --> 01:57:03,329
Easy, easy, easy.

1497
01:57:03,331 --> 01:57:06,633
Hey, back up. Everybody back up.
We need air.

1498
01:57:07,267 --> 01:57:08,602
Yeah.

1499
01:57:11,772 --> 01:57:13,673
- We did it.
- We did it.

1500
01:57:37,596 --> 01:57:39,332
- Let's go home.
- Let's go, D.

1501
01:57:46,173 --> 01:57:48,607
I'm good, Ma.
I'm good.

1502
01:57:55,781 --> 01:57:58,483
- I did it. I did it.
- You did it.

1503
01:57:58,485 --> 01:57:59,952
Hey, Unc.

1504
01:58:13,165 --> 01:58:14,967
It's your time.

1505
01:58:32,818 --> 01:58:35,154
Hey, okay, back up.

1506
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:15,394
What's up, Pops?

1507
01:59:20,798 --> 01:59:23,401
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come see you.

1508
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:31,342
I'm not sure how
this is supposed to go. Um...

1509
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:38,047
I guess I should tell you that
Mom's doing pretty good.

1510
01:59:38,049 --> 01:59:40,717
You know, she's holding up.

1511
01:59:42,753 --> 01:59:44,987
So is Rocky.

1512
01:59:44,989 --> 01:59:46,189
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

1513
01:59:46,191 --> 01:59:47,791
<i>He's a tough dude.</i>

1514
01:59:49,594 --> 01:59:51,762
<i>I can see why you liked him.</i>

1515
01:59:54,132 --> 01:59:57,366
I also see why
you wanted to fight him, too.

1516
02:00:06,277 --> 02:00:07,778
Look, um,

1517
02:00:09,746 --> 02:00:12,049
I just came here
to tell you that...

1518
02:00:18,523 --> 02:00:20,123
That I did it.

1519
02:00:23,794 --> 02:00:26,029
But I didn't do it for you.

1520
02:00:29,466 --> 02:00:31,101
<i>Or because of them.</i>

1521
02:00:33,136 --> 02:00:36,473
<i>I did it because
it was my fight.</i>

1522
02:00:38,508 --> 02:00:40,444
<i>And when I stepped
into that ring,</i>

1523
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:45,182
it wasn't just about me.

1524
02:00:48,452 --> 02:00:49,453
Hello.

1525
02:00:51,955 --> 02:00:53,588
You must be Logan.

1526
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:55,023
Yes. Who are you?

1527
02:00:55,025 --> 02:00:57,025
Lo, who is it?

1528
02:00:57,027 --> 02:01:00,861
<i>Sometimes we think we
have to do it all on our own.</i>

1529
02:01:00,863 --> 02:01:02,266
Hey, Robert.

1530
02:01:03,567 --> 02:01:04,934
<i>But we don't.</i>

1531
02:01:06,236 --> 02:01:09,339
I was just around
in the neighborhood, so...

1532
02:01:15,612 --> 02:01:17,347
This is your grandfather.

1533
02:01:28,891 --> 02:01:32,627
You look just like his mother.

1534
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:35,965
Yeah, I know.

1535
02:01:42,972 --> 02:01:45,274
I wanna introduce you
to somebody.

1536
02:01:55,985 --> 02:01:57,819
Do you wanna come inside?

1537
02:02:05,361 --> 02:02:06,727
Yeah.

1538
02:02:06,729 --> 02:02:08,164
Give me that.

1539
02:02:18,341 --> 02:02:21,974
- Is that a ball?
- Yeah.

1540
02:02:21,976 --> 02:02:24,012
- Wanna play catch?
- Yes.

1541
02:02:25,113 --> 02:02:26,549
There you go.

1542
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:28,617
This

1543
02:02:30,285 --> 02:02:33,920
is your granddaughter. Amara.

1544
02:02:33,922 --> 02:02:35,957
Say what's up to Pop-Pop.
