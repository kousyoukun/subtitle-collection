1
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,540
Oh, sorry.

2
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,830
All right, let me hear it.

3
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,100
You're already done?

4
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,640
Motherfucker, I gave
you two hours.

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,330
Is this too happy?

6
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,470
Right.

7
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,450
I like that.

8
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,340
- I do like the falsetto, though.
- What?

9
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,510
The falsetto.

10
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,650
♪ Gonna get my laptop
and write it down ♪

11
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,450
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

12
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,160
I was thinking of doing something
like a modern-day "Mrs. Robinson."

13
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,550
Or have you got
anything going on?

14
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,690
You just say... you can also...

15
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,760
I feel like it should be
about some real shit though.

16
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,260
- Yeah, I know but...
- Like...

17
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,970
Is there any relationship shit
right now? Nothing right now.

18
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,420
Yeah. It's gonna be quite harsh.

19
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,760
It's like the man
version of a girl power tune.

20
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,730
Yeah, I want Benny for that bit,
though, 'cause I don't know.

21
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,610
It just changes, man.
When you're, like...

22
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,680
When you're doing it
ten years...

23
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,780
You think I'm gonna
lose my moment?

24
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,390
No, you're just gonna think...
you're gonna look at it differently.

25
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,960
Like, right now, you're doing what I did.
Just, like, push, push, push.

26
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,060
And dude and just,
like, you know,

27
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,400
take care of your moment when
you have these songs in you.

28
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,430
And then like, you just feel like,
and then you just feel like...

29
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,970
"Wait, I'm always gonna have these songs
in me, I can slow down a little bit."

30
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,370
Taylor's been pushing on ten
years, and she's pushing on.

31
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,570
Yeah. You know what I'm saying,
though but?

32
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,980
I don't know.

33
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,750
Like for me, I feel it's a little bit
different as a producer, but I'm like,

34
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,480
"Okay, I'm only
gonna do things...

35
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,090
that inspire me and I don't care
what the outcome is."

36
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,990
- Yo, let me inspire you.
- Let me inspire you.

37
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,600
Oh, someone
turned off the thing.

38
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,510
This is what we got.
It's gotta get a little harder, you know?

39
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,610
A little less happy in there.

40
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
Wow.

41
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,460
Yeah, 'cause everything is
set up so good until that point.

42
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,100
If you love the way you look that much,
you should just go fuck yourself.

43
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,510
- Too much.
- Edit.

44
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,620
- That's dope.
- I do think that's pretty sick.

45
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,460
It instantly becomes a
classic if you say "love yourself."

46
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,490
Like, it becomes less of a joke.

47
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,900
Yeah?
♪ You should go and love yourself ♪

48
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,470
It kinda works, yeah.

49
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,040
You wanna just drop
it so we have it?

50
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,830
You got
something on your lens.

51
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,030
I started filming Ed in 2008,
but, we're cousins so we go way back.

52
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,040
I have a lot of cousins,
but he's probably the one I'm closest to.

53
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,210
He's known me, from like,
you know being a really weird little kid.

54
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,240
When I first ever went
to London when I was 16,

55
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,880
he let me sleep on his sofa
in Bethnal Green.

56
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,950
I'd film his early gigs and
stick them up on his YouTube or MySpace.

57
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,750
He signed a record deal and he
asked me would I come out on tour

58
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,120
and capture everything?

59
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,160
I mean we were, like best
mates anyway, so we're cousins

60
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,790
but we, kind of really,
really bonded on tour.

61
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,600
We went all over.
UK, Europe, America, Asia.

62
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,560
It was fun.

63
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,000
The first time I ever saw Ed
write, he had invited Foy Vance,

64
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,840
who was a hero of his,

65
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,140
one of his favorite musicians,
to be on tour with him.

66
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,210
At every opportunity,
Ed would, like, pull Foy aside

67
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,950
and find a place in the venue that
they could go and kinda jam it out.

68
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,350
Those jam sessions
turned into writing sessions,

69
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,620
and then I'd film all of that.

70
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,660
I don't think it was until 2013

71
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,860
that I actually properly
got in the studio

72
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,630
and watched him do something
from start to finish.

73
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,170
I guess, this is the first time on camera
you're gonna see a song being written

74
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,830
bit by bit, so Murray,
make sure you get all of it.

75
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,610
I remember it was the
first day I met Benny Blanco.

76
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,940
We were in New York
and Ed had an idea for a song.

77
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,040
You know, I'd just been
through something that

78
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,810
I really needed to
get on to a song.

79
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,780
We made "Don't" in about two hours.
I had like a vocal loop that went...

80
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,720
We made a beat out of that,
and he left me in the room.

81
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,230
He let me write the story
and then, yeah.

82
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,630
I'm never like, in like a mood

83
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,370
for longer than a day,

84
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,740
but in that day if I write a
song, that song exists forever.

85
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,070
It's just such a cool thing.

86
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,140
Something come from nothing

87
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,240
and become the thing that people
sing back to him at gigs

88
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,710
or you hear it on the
radio in your car.

89
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,420
To watch that from start to
finish is something special.

90
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,150
I guess I just wanted to capture
that more and more.

91
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,030
Oh... He's...

92
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,260
- Come on, Benny. Fucking hell.
- Beep again, mate.

93
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,270
- Hi guys.
- Sir Benny Blanco.

94
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,410
Does anyone want string cheese?

95
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,680
Yeah.

96
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,780
We are going...

97
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,450
I don't even know where
the fuck we are right now,

98
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,390
but it's a long way
away from LA.

99
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,260
And we're gonna write
a lot of song stuff.

100
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,990
Put together all my favorite
people, musicians.

101
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,390
Foy, Amy and Johnny.

102
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,960
What are you worried about?

103
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,400
The thing that I'm worried about is
that I work one on one with people.

104
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,110
And this is like one on seven,
all in different rooms and kind of...

105
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,780
I dunno, I've never done it
before. It'll be fun.

106
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,750
So I got this, it goes...

107
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,260
Yeah.

108
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,160
I'll have a think.

109
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,840
We'll play the track
before we start.

110
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,040
Wait till you hear it.

111
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,060
That's the, like, we had the...
We had something like that.

112
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,790
Yeah, but when we were talking about
it lyrically, but flipping it around

113
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,100
so now, it's our turn to look after them
like they did for us when we were young.

114
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,380
Yeah.

115
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,080
But I prefer this kind of Springsteen-y,
sort of, you know.

116
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,950
- I'm gonna finish this song.
- Work away.

117
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,290
I'm gonna come back, and then
come here. Bit of a mindfuck.

118
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,360
What are you thinking?

119
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,130
I tell you what,
it's too many ideas.

120
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,500
What do you want to do?
Do we finish the song

121
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,140
or keep the idea
and then finish later?

122
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,870
- No, let's finish the song.
- Alright, come on.

123
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,570
This is really good.

124
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,610
- Do you wanna hear the song?
- Yeah.

125
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,420
How's it sounding?

126
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,310
This shit is fire.

127
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,650
Yes, yes, yes.

128
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,900
Gonna get my laptop.
And write a song.

129
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,500
It's
really fucking early.

130
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,370
No one's awake.

131
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,640
I'm really jet-lagged.

132
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,110
How did yesterday go?

133
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,410
Yesterday was good.

134
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,980
Quite confusing.

135
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
Yeah.

136
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,420
I don't know if it would work better as,
like, three weeks of individual sessions.

137
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,660
Probably.

138
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,630
I think if loads of ideas are
started, that would be great.

139
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,950
Could just write a song.
That'd be a good one.

140
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,290
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yes.

141
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,530
Let's just write it.

142
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,100
Another one?

143
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,010
Songs are weird things.

144
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,180
How so?

145
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,490
They just come and go.
They never give you any warning.

146
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,630
I've been up since 5:00, Amy.

147
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,800
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- We wrote a song, though.

148
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,030
- Very good.
- Come down, we'll write another one.

149
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,130
I'm coming down now.

150
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,270
You dick.

151
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,310
- What is this?
- Just coffee.

152
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,350
- I can see right through it to Australia.
- Well, it was in the pot.

153
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,520
What's your future?

154
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,450
- That was yesterday's coffee.
- Oh, who cares? It's basically gravy.

155
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,760
Alright well, you can put it off.
I'll fucking take it back then.

156
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,290
Give it to me.

157
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,130
Wait, I'll play the other riff.

158
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,140
- I like that.
- Lovely.

159
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,620
That's great.

160
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,830
One more time?
It's gonna be fun.

161
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,620
That's it.

162
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,660
And there's some kind
of riff there, maybe?

163
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,160
Then it has different sections.
Okay, should we put that bit down?

164
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,830
Can you play the chorus?

165
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,830
- So "The Ramblas"?
- "Ramblas, I'll meet you,

166
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,640
we'll dance around
La Sagrada..."

167
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,340
That is so good.

168
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,290
Yeah, let's do that. So...

169
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Like, "Ramblas, I'll meet you...

170
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,370
Oh, yeah.

171
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,680
Yeah, good!

172
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,450
All right, let's write this.

173
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,250
Let's write this.
This is really good.

174
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,750
- Sagrada familia...
- Everybody get their Spanish out.

175
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,790
- Let's just do it.
- "Te amo mi cariña."

176
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,590
♪ Te amo mi cariña. ♪

177
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,660
- Ed would like your opinion.
- Oh, great.

178
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,370
What've you
been working on, Benny?

179
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,500
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit.

180
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,940
Where are you guys?
All the way down there?

181
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,470
Let me get my shoes.

182
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,950
That's the best.

183
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,220
I love the Spanish.
That's amazing.

184
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,670
What's up, homie?

185
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,500
Raise the roof.

186
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,900
Good morning.

187
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,270
It's like, it goes...

188
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,920
I like that idea of, like...

189
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm guarded.

190
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,760
- Yeah.
- Like... You know.

191
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,350
Yeah.

192
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,690
Benny? Benny?

193
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,960
Benny! Benny!

194
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,860
- Yeah?
- We got the next bit.

195
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,490
- Oh, what is it?
- I'll sing it.

196
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,400
All right.

197
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,940
I do think it should go,
"Don't tell me you need me."

198
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,350
- "...you need me."
- I might have to move it down, then.

199
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,700
- Let's get Foy.
- Oh, my God. Can we please?

200
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,870
Let's get Foy to riff.

201
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,910
Are you serious?
I would be so excited for that.

202
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,610
- So we need to write that again.
- Yeah.

203
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,350
I want food so bad.

204
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,360
- Peace.
- Benny, let's fu... Benny!

205
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,060
- He said, "Oh, peace!"
- Sorry. Did you hear me? Peace!

206
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,900
- Wait.
- I'm eating food.

207
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,870
Food is ready.
I worked up an appetite.

208
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,400
- Oh, shit. Holy shit. Whoo!
- I'm waiting for you.

209
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,950
Are you OK if it wasn't a gypsy melody,
but everything in the music was?

210
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,490
We'll do it with a
dancehall beat, like...

211
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,000
Most of it's about grandma
and granddad.

212
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,770
And about my grandma and granddad
were Protestant and Catholic

213
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,410
and couldn't get married.

214
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,680
One point of that is that
granddad made the wedding ring

215
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,420
out of gold that he
stole from a dentist.

216
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,950
No way!

217
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,450
That's such a cool story.

218
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,830
Murray, just set up the camera
and come write with us.

219
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,870
- Right.
- That's cool.

220
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,680
Yeah, it's really good.

221
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,950
Should it be "I met her at Guy's in
the 2nd World War, blah, blah..."

222
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,520
And the next bit is "they're from
a farmer's town in Belfast town".

223
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,650
And then, in the next bit,
the second half?

224
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,090
Maybe. 'Cause you're, like,
setting up the relationship with her.

225
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,190
Let's hear it.

226
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:30,860
I know, but what I'm saying is
the second verse, half of it sets off,

227
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,730
and half of it is the end bit,

228
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,140
whereas the last verse
is all set up as well.

229
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,700
And I don't want
to end it going...

230
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,970
"I met her in the
Second World War"

231
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,540
You should end it being like
"From a Belfast boy in a Belfast town..."

232
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,880
"And now we're sat here old and grey,
blah, blah, with our kids."

233
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,820
I think that works more.

234
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,860
Oh! Oh, no, an hour.
Cherry lands in an hour.

235
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,600
Yeah, nice. Yeah.

236
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,250
All the songs on this album have a thread
that goes through it, and it's all family.

237
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,120
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And it's all like... it's all family.

238
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,820
- It's really fucking good.
- I'm glad you're feeling that.

239
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,090
Really good.

240
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,720
It's... yeah.

241
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,030
I'm not worried about
the album anymore.

242
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,230
The thing is, we've got
four more weeks like this.

243
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,700
We've got...

244
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,130
No, three more... yes.

245
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,870
Yeah, no, we haven't got a lot,
we got the boat, and then a month,

246
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,640
and then another two weeks,
so two months straight.

247
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,250
But I imagine half of that we'll
be recording, not just writing.

248
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,050
And if it's the same
as the last album,

249
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,320
you get like three singles
gone off at the very end.

250
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Like what was it? "Thinking Out
Loud," "Sing" and "Don't"

251
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,690
were after the album
was finished, no?

252
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,990
Yeah, but that's 'cause I was scrambling
'cause the album wasn't great.

253
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,760
I don't think I'm
scrambling this time.

254
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,170
Now, if you could just get a big
fucking creative drive just before.

255
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,010
Yeah, I think there's got
to be a point where you...

256
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,880
Yeah, start the next one.

257
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,010
Just don't tell
Benny about them.

258
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,120
It's great.

259
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,930
Who's that? Who's that?
There they go.

260
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,930
- Hey, you allright?
- Hey.

261
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,130
- How are you doing?
- Yeah, I'm good.

262
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,270
- Are you?
- And you?

263
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,370
Dave, Cherry. Cherry, Dave.

264
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,310
- Hello! Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

265
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,250
Play the... really quickly,
the one about my grandma.

266
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,880
- Oh, the...
- "Nancy Mulligan."

267
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,390
I love it.

268
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,370
Right. Before we start,

269
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,070
this traditional band's gonna play on it,
like fiddle and everything.

270
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,440
You think you'll have them
on stage and shit?

271
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,790
Mate, I think if you produce
that up...

272
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,860
I'll fuck with it. Oh my
God, this food smells so good.

273
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,230
Should we put
your stuff in the room?

274
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,980
- But, like, super soft playing.
- That's easy.

275
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,510
So you're like...

276
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,070
Go to F.

277
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,080
You see?

278
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,090
- Then we can record it...
- I like "You seem happier."

279
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,320
I'll record the piano.

280
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,190
All right, you record.
Nobody Talk!

281
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,430
But record soft going into hard.

282
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,060
Nice one, bro.

283
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,570
On that section, I had
had it going back to the F.

284
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,310
Instead of A, G, C,

285
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,610
I had it going A... So it's
different. Something different.

286
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,950
A, F, C.

287
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,350
- Yeah.
- That works? Okay.

288
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,660
Can you hear that?

289
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,600
Can you hear the sound of 4,000
label executives coming to you

290
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,200
and being like, "Yo, we need
another one of those, Benny"?

291
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,240
- How many times has that happened?
- A lot.

292
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,340
But I always just... I
already did that.

293
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,640
I hate it when the labels try to
get you to do the same song.

294
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,450
I just go, "But I
just did that song."

295
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,720
Does the label ever tell you,
they're like,

296
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,090
"We need you to do
another one of these"?

297
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,160
No.

298
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,430
Benny's been sending it back and forth,
but we haven't touched it since... Malibu.

299
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,030
So, yeah, we just
begin on the boat.

300
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,670
See, he's built this studio on a boat,
it's not in a room, it's like a...

301
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,240
It's like a room.
It's like bigger than that.

302
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,640
- No.
- Really weird.

303
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,040
I was expecting a cabin
with, like, on the tour bus.

304
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,140
Yes, same.

305
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,240
So what's he got?

306
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,820
Probably about
twice the size of that.

307
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,350
- This is my phone.
- He does have a phone!

308
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,600
Oh, my God. This boat is huge.

309
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:39,470
Like in case something goes wrong,
I don't want to be in that orange boat.

310
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,340
Like, look at all the boats and then
look at the little orange boat.

311
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,550
Yeah mate, you can't get a fucking
boat because you're scared of flying

312
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,180
and now tell me you're gonna
be scared of a boat.

313
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,320
Oh no, I don't care.

314
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,520
I talked to this guy yesterday
'cause I was so nervous.

315
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,590
And he said there's only one
transatlantic boat

316
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,260
that has ever sank,
and it was the Titanic.

317
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:07,230
I don't fly because I was on a
flight like seven or eight years ago

318
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,800
and it was one of those flights
where no one was allowed to get up.

319
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,270
The whole time
they were like, "Stay seated!"

320
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,610
Like, people were like peeing their
pants and it was like a big thing.

321
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,580
And the lady was rolling the cart
down before she shut everyone off

322
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,350
and all of sudden the cart moved
and she was like, "Ah!"

323
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,650
And she, like,
fell and rolled down the thing.

324
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,860
You know when you look at the
stewardess and you really...

325
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,330
"You're really like. "everything's gonna
be all right," 'cause they're smiling.

326
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,300
On this one they're like...

327
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,570
And I was fucking freaked out.

328
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,340
And then I got off the plane and
immediately got on another plane

329
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,540
that was like a six-seater
and we were in a thunderstorm

330
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,840
and it was fucking horrible.

331
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,150
And then I flew one more time and I
was like, I'm not flying ever again.

332
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,220
In my head, I know exactly
what's on the album.

333
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,660
It's like a 12-track album,
I know like 15.

334
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,730
For me, when I see
them all together,

335
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,160
I'll know how to
produce certain things.

336
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,300
It's a little bit hazy for me
until we get it all together.

337
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,530
We have 11 for the main,

338
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,170
'cause I don't know
about "Happier" or "New Man,"

339
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,470
I have to finish "Happier",
I have to finish "New Man."

340
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:24,240
I would be a bad producer if
we didn't work on those two songs.

341
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,190
Let's think of a cool
lick or something, or a way.

342
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,800
Yeah, I'll do that.

343
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,550
- Now, play it, play it out.
- What?

344
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,720
These lines I need to say
something cleverer than those two.

345
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,750
Okay.

346
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,370
Oh, that you can't sleep at all.
Like, it's like...

347
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:29,540
Like it's late at night,
you can't sleep,

348
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,540
you're fucking chain in a room,

349
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,710
deciding whether to
fucking call the person or not

350
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,450
or look through all
your old shit and...

351
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,360
I like something about something.

352
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,500
Or alcohol or something that...

353
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,570
All right, mate.

354
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,370
Should we come grab
you a... in like...

355
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,940
We're going to the casino, should we
come grab you in like half an hour?

356
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,520
That's that pain right there.

357
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,720
Let's listen to it from
the beginning.

358
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,460
Yeah, bruh. I like that.

359
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,360
- I feel bad for sending Kev away now.
- Why?

360
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,430
I don't know, I can't write when
someone's just sitting there staring.

361
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,870
- What, Kevin?
- No, no, just anyone.

362
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,800
Like, Murray's filming,
but anyone who's just there,

363
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,410
I just feel really, like,
self-conscious.

364
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,740
Murray was just like,
we have to film somewhere.

365
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,380
He's like: "Because we could
literally just be anywhere."

366
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,490
He's like, yeah, he's never been outside.
You were literally outside one time.

367
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,560
I don't like going outside.

368
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,860
Just like you don't like flying,

369
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,100
I don't like being
around people.

370
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,960
Bruh.

371
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,700
- We're turning him into a sailor.
- I made him take it.

372
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,040
I hate to fly.

373
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,710
- Do you? Oh, that's brilliant.
- I hate it.

374
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,810
- And here's an alternative.
- I know, I like it.

375
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,850
- It's very relaxing, I think.
- Yeah, starting to go a little crazy.

376
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,880
Zebra!

377
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,760
When are you gonna
turn into a Ze-Bruh?

378
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,420
Can you see me?

379
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,830
♪ Mean it ♪

380
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,700
Sounds like "Penis."

381
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,870
♪ Penis ♪

382
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,740
Only if you put a P
in front of it.

383
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,840
♪ Penis ♪

384
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,610
Alright Benny, I
want you to do me a favor?

385
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,810
- Oh, God, this feels weird.
- What?

386
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,010
- It just suddenly went...
- Whoa, look it.

387
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,080
Want to stand on
that to test it?

388
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,980
Oh, my God, I'm gonna...

389
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,120
Okay.

390
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,590
- All right.
- Benny. Benny, this is worse.

391
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,960
This one's scarier?

392
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,100
Oh, my. Okay,
okay, you go first.

393
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,740
That's it. Arms sideways
just in case it breaks.

394
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,510
Just in case.

395
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,840
- That's the scariest...
- Thank you so much

396
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,940
for showing us around.

397
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,050
So this is technically
the last day on the boat,

398
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,620
yet you will have no idea,

399
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,920
because we've worn the same
clothes every single day.

400
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,190
So it looks like we've been
on the boat for a day.

401
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,460
But we haven't.

402
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,900
Benny looks like
he hasn't changed since 2006.

403
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,870
2007, please, thank you.

404
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,870
Wait, who am I?

405
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,970
- Someone I'm taking to the zoo tomorrow.
- No, I'm you. I'm Ed.

406
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,780
Look I have my hands
just like him now.

407
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,530
Oh, I'm so happy!

408
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,200
Is this, like,
up north or south?

409
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,810
No, this is east, southeast.
This is above London.

410
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,240
But below, like,
Manchester and stuff like that.

411
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,880
I'll take you for a drive.
I'll show you all the spots.

412
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,520
You guys, it still feels
like I'm on a boat.

413
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,920
- What was it, five, six days?
- Seven.

414
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,520
Don't you feel like that?

415
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,530
- Do you feel like you're on a boat?
- Not anymore.

416
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,160
Oh, man, I do. Crazy.

417
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,130
- What's that?
- Bitch.

418
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,270
So, this is the town.

419
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,710
- So now we're in town?
- That's the village I lived in

420
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,050
and this is the town,
it's called Framlingham.

421
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,220
This is someone going
back to school.

422
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,620
All right,
boy. How ya getting on.

423
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,720
I recorded my first ever song
down there on Damford Drive

424
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,120
with my old guitar teacher,
when I was 11.

425
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,560
What was the song?

426
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,730
"Typical Average Teen"?

427
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,760
Really rolls off the tongue.

428
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,170
"Typical Average Teen."

429
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,900
- Remember any more of it?
- I remember all of it,

430
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,840
but I'm not gonna
sing any of it.

431
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,040
How does the chorus go?
Is it a smash?

432
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,210
- Wait, is it actually that?
- Yeah.

433
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,610
I just guessed that.

434
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,900
That was fine.

435
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,240
Good.
Want to spice it up a bit more?

436
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,810
Well, when I spice it
up, it sounds too cockney.

437
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,020
Oh, should we put the vocals in
so I know where they're...

438
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,220
What? Yeah, we can.
They said they might want to play with...

439
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,660
- With me singing?
- Maybe without it.

440
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,190
Why don't you just sing?
Why don't we just do it like that?

441
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,660
Everyone happy?
Here we go. Four clicks.

442
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,900
Lovely.

443
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,770
It's getting Irish today.

444
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,810
It's getting
very Irish today.

445
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,250
Did you go to the C?

446
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,170
That's nice.

447
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,780
Do we have a song?

448
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,210
- I hear that more as a chorus.
- Yeah?

449
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,820
That's why I'm thinking
play through it there.

450
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,100
Or whatever, somewhere else.

451
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,170
Yeah.

- Yeah, or...
- Or pretty little Derry girl.

00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,780
♪ Oh, my pretty
little Galway girl ♪

461
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,340
- But you can't say Galway girl.
- I don't...

462
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,110
'Cause there's
a song called "Galway Girl."

463
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,210
Cadence wise it feels good,
though.

464
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,070
I think that song works better
than Galway Girl.

465
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,370
- I think this idea of having...
- Rap on a trad song?

466
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,980
Yeah. It's so unique.

467
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,950
- I like it.
- I do, too.

468
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,180
The album's missing one of these,
I need to get the verses right.

469
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,070
I don't like the end of that.

470
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,870
Like changing that...

471
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,520
I don't know, I'll find a
different end line for that.

472
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,560
So it goes...

473
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,140
There you go.

474
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,600
Like an accordion?

475
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,330
Can you get on the fiddle as
well and do that...

476
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
I fucking love it.

477
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,270
Would it sound too busy
if it had a fiddle in the verse?

478
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,440
We'll soon find out?

479
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,010
The chorus is the same chords as well
and everyone joins in on the motif

480
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:47,680
that you would do on the verses,
if that makes sense.

481
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,520
So, if you had a motif for the
verse, the kinda rappy verse,

482
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,590
and then when it gets into the...
...everyone comes in with the same motif.

483
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,320
Would that sound good?

484
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,590
- I think so.
- Wanna try it?

485
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,280
F sharp.

486
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,400
That's nice!

487
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,140
That would be pretty sick,
though, if we just fused them.

488
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,770
We just changed
the last phrase.

489
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:28,710
One more time.

490
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,520
Chris, do you reckon
I can stand up?

491
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,520
Yeah, sure.

492
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,690
Can't believe
you're sitting down.

493
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,460
I can't believe it too.
Chris is an amateur, man.

494
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,700
Good,
let's get that on film.

495
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,170
- So good.
- That's good.

496
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:21,870
So sweaty.

497
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,740
So, we're going
to Thomas Mills High School now,

498
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,180
and I'm gonna teach some music.

499
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,510
It's the high school I went to.

500
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,450
This is the award I got at
school when I was 16

501
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,420
for Most Likely to be famous
at the prom.

502
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,890
And we're gonna see Mr. Hanley,
who's a lad, a really cool guy.

503
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,230
Trip down memory lane.

504
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:44,420
My music teacher at school
was a guy called Mr. Hanley.

505
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,280
And every time I
speak to him now,

506
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,250
he always maintains
that he didn't do that much.

507
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:49,990
But he really did.

508
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,290
He wasn't like a rigid music teacher
in the sense that he was like,

509
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,490
"You have to learn
music theory or do this."

510
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,700
He knew from a very young age
that I liked playing guitar

511
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,500
and liked writing songs.

512
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,470
And he didn't necessarily know about
the sort of music that I was into,

513
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,940
but he could see
I was passionate about music

514
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,570
and him as a teacher just encouraged that,
to the point that

515
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:10,980
he'd let me leave school early on a day to
catch a train to London to go play a gig.

516
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,310
Look at that.
Here we go, there it is.

517
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,720
Is that my handwriting?
Oh, no, there I am.

518
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,550
Look at the little paw and
everything! Oh, that's nuts.

519
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,820
- Hi.
- How are you?

520
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,490
This is Ed Sheeran.

521
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:28,690
There were a lot of teachers
at my school who, I think,

522
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,430
didn't quite get it.

523
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,530
And a lot of my friends as well
just didn't get it.

524
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:35,330
I remember like dropping out of
school and moving to London

525
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,700
and all of my mates being like:
"What are you doing?

526
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,810
This is not gonna work out.
You want to be a famous musician, do you?"

527
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,040
And I think Mr. Hanley never had
a doubt. Yeah, he's really cool.

528
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,580
I kinda view songwriting as
like a dirty tap in an old house

529
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,580
'cause you switch
on the dirty tap,

530
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,920
I'm gonna swear, sorry.

531
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,390
You switch on the dirty
tap and it spits out

532
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,820
shit water for
about kind of 10 minutes

533
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,390
and it's just mud and grit and just
all sorts of messiness coming out.

534
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,700
Then it starts flowing clean water, and
then little bits of grit still come out,

535
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,600
but after a while
it's just clean.

536
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,730
When I first started writing
songs, they were terrible.

537
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,740
And that was the mud and grit coming out,
and I was unplugging it.

538
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,940
And I tried to write two or
three songs a day for a while,

539
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,410
just unplugging.

540
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,010
Now and then you'd get
the odd good song,

541
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,010
the first clean
water coming out.

542
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:25,050
And then once it all... Once all
the bad songs have gone,

543
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,620
the good songs start flowing.

544
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,590
Now and then,
I'd write a bad song,

545
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,560
but the key is when you know
you're writing bad songs,

546
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,320
make sure you finish it, just so
you can get it out of you,

547
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,990
because if you don't, your next
song will have a bad part in it.

548
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:38,630
So just view it as
a constant stream.

549
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,470
Try and write a song a day,
even if it's terrible,

550
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,400
just get it out of you,

551
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,940
because the best songs that you
write will be five years from now.

552
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,840
I have notes on my phone

553
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,840
and every time I see something
or get something that rhymes.

554
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,010
I remember, the way that I wrote
"A Team" is, for a month, I had a...

555
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,620
I'll tell a bad story.

556
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,850
I had friends that sold cocaine
from just skating to people.

557
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:05,020
And just selling it, and my initial thing
was "Johnny is in the Class A Team,"

558
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,690
that's the first thing
I wrote down in my notes.

559
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,830
Then I went into in a homeless
shelter I met this girl called Angel

560
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,500
who was on a lot of drugs.

561
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,570
And, like, the next thing I wrote down was
"Her face crumbling like pastries."

562
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,700
And so I wrote down
all these kind of,

563
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,940
"A Team," "daydream,"
"pastries" "they scream".

564
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,480
All these rhymes in my phone

565
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,010
and one day sat down and the
song happened in 20 minutes.

566
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,980
But that was like three months
of stocking stuff up...

567
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,820
My self-belief came from...
I wasn't good at anything else,

568
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,690
so, as soon as I
started excelling,

569
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,760
and I was in a very small pond
as well at my school,

570
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,830
so I was one of maybe three people
that plays guitar and wrote songs.

571
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,430
Thank you.

572
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,030
- Nice to meet you.
- Check this out.

573
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:55,410
That's me when I was 11,
with Steve of eighth grade.

574
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,110
- That would be Ben.
- He's here?

575
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,750
Yeah.

576
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,150
Hello.

577
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,820
What's up, man?

578
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,190
Should we go in the main studio
and play songs?

579
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,930
Yeah, sure. Or we
can do it over there.

580
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,130
Do you want to play "Perfect"?

581
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,010
Yeah. It'll sound much more
unified with an actual orchestra

582
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,650
because there's different string
samples from different libraries

583
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:38,180
depending on how good that they are,
I think, like tremolo and stuff.

584
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,820
I think we're just gonna pull it
all and make it one tight piece.

585
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,760
It's gonna be good.

586
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,690
- It'll fit in with the rest.
- Yeah. It's gonna be sick.

587
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,460
- Where will you record?
- Abbey Road.

588
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,600
- It's gonna be cool.
- Not bad.

589
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,610
Have you seen it yet?

590
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,720
Chez.

591
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,190
Thank you. Drop.

592
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,990
Exquisite!

593
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,510
- This will be a lot louder.
- It's really good.

594
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:37,240
- It's in time now as well.
- Yeah.

595
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,780
Can you think what's
been done in this room?

596
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,570
- Thank you.
- Very good.

597
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,540
There's edges to it as well,
you know what I mean?

598
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,940
Lovely arrangement.

599
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,610
- Yeah. Matt's done all right.
- He smashed it.

600
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,310
Yeah, I'm really
glad my mom came.

601
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,850
Yeah, 'cause her mom's ill...
she's just been there.

602
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:22,320
So she really hasn't
gotten out of the house.

603
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,190
Lovely stuff, and...

604
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:27,690
He can be here.

605
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,660
Guys, if you want to come in the
room when they're doing it,

606
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,830
I'm sure that's fine.

607
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,830
That was fantastic,
um...

608
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:38,570
This is Benny, the producer of
the album.

609
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,040
Okay!

610
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:46,680
Let's give it a
shot, then.

611
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,310
Thank you,
see you guys soon.

612
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:25,020
All right. Couldn't have gone
better. Really good.

613
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:26,960
- You love it?
- Yeah.

614
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,260
Thanks for singing with them.
I think it's a good idea.

615
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,530
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

616
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,200
Really fun. I enjoyed it.

617
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,070
Is it all
about you then?

618
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,040
Maybe he's got a piece on the
side that he's singing about.

619
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,300
- Exciting.
- How many months' work?

620
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,440
Two years.

621
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,440
What was the
first one you wrote?

622
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,650
I think it was "Perfect."

623
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:27,180
"Perfect" must've been
the first one on the album.

624
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,220
And then...

625
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,990
"Castle on the Hill."

626
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:38,960
I think.

627
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,330
And is this
the last one that you wrote?

628
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,440
No, the last one I wrote
you haven't heard yet.

629
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,210
- I'm gonna wait til a good time to play it to you.
- Okay.

630
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,280
It's the one that will make
Mommy cry.

631
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:57,110
They all make Mommy cry.

632
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,580
- No, this one really will.
- Really?

633
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,260
Can you pull up
"Supermarket Flowers"?

634
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:13,560
So have you written this
in the last few weeks?

635
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,230
Oh, what? "Supermarket Flowers"?

636
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:18,570
Yeah, that we wrote it
when Johnny was here.

637
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,740
I don't think it's the time to
play it to Mommy yet.

638
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:25,710
I think we gotta
wait a bit of time.

639
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,870
Wow, that
was utterly beautiful.

640
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,450
Yeah, definitely
don't play that for a while.

641
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,650
No.

642
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:39,870
So this song
that they reckon is missing.

643
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:47,410
I've got an idea of a
song in my head

644
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,950
that I think will sort it out.

645
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:52,780
Cool.

646
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,790
That's my one little thing
I'm clinging onto,

647
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:01,590
being like, everything's gonna be
all right 'cause I've got this idea.

648
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,500
Either than that, if I didn't
have that idea, I'd be fucked,

649
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,900
when they asked,
"Yeah, one more song."

650
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:12,300
I'd be like,
"I have no ideas anymore!

651
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:16,970
You've run me dry.
You run me... you run me down."

652
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,510
"You run me down."

653
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,780
They just want it to
be a classic, but...

654
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,990
And so do I. And I do agree with
them that it needs something

655
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:35,860
that is kind of like "Don't" or
"New Man" or "Bloodstream"

656
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:42,270
that's just kind of a bit to the point,
but that isn't a throwaway.

657
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Out.

658
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,310
I like that. The whole song
feels, like, high,

659
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:58,620
and then when that
kicks in, I like it.

660
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,560
Can you take out that one part?

661
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,700
Whatever new bit you put in the "Oh I,
oh I, oh I" of the old one.

662
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,400
That needs to go,
'cause it's wrong.

663
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,700
And then take out
the other thing that's put in.

664
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:23,570
You guys put in so much stuff.
Just... I don't know.

665
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,510
So much stuff that wasn't there,
that shouldn't be there.

666
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,710
I thought we
were just mixing it.

667
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:32,520
Just let me do it,
it'll sound good, I promise you.

668
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,620
It's just there's a reason why
it comes in and comes out,

669
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:40,590
'cause if there's something there,
then by the time the "Oh I, oh I" comes in

670
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,760
it doesn't lift at all.

671
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,800
If you want it to lift and
drop, and do all of that,

672
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,300
then keep it the
same way it was.

673
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,700
'Cause the point in it was
the chorus is a step back,

674
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,900
and then when it
kicks in, it kicks in.

675
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,070
And if it just kicks in through the
whole song, it just gonna sound shit.

676
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,740
I promise you
it will sound better this way.

677
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,610
We'll have a listen
in the car later.

678
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,520
This is the best way, though.

679
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,620
Can that kick in more
when it comes in?

680
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,590
All this one?

681
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:19,660
No, that's cool,
there's a jangly guitar.

682
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,400
I know exactly where that is.

683
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,040
That's good.

684
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,840
I like that. No, there's like
a really high jangly one.

685
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,110
That...
That one.

686
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,550
Those need to come
down a little bit.

687
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:40,020
Or they need to be not
as high frequency.

688
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,690
Just a bid more mid.

689
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,990
Might have to
re-sing that last line.

690
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:50,090
I need to go through
those original BVs with you

691
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:52,030
just to make sure I've
got the right ones,

692
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:55,030
and make sure
we don't need to add any to it.

693
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,470
- Just to make it more powerful.
- That's why I liked the lower ones.

694
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:59,940
Yeah.

695
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:03,510
So you're saying the new low ones
won't work with the original?

696
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,480
No. But I don't particularly
like the original.

697
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
Right.

698
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:13,450
Because on Steve's version, right?
The newer vocals really kick in for me.

699
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:16,490
Why don't you like those ones?

700
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:22,630
I don't dislike them, but I
think the old one has the higher part,

701
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:25,760
which I think is the most important part
of all to me, that's the hooky one.

702
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,000
You should maybe do an ad-lib
on that final chorus as well.

703
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:35,970
Cue.

704
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:42,510
Spike, do you want me to try doing "Oh I,
oh I, oh I" the low ones?

705
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:45,150
If you want that
massive, that'll really help.

706
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:48,050
- See, I love the new ones you did.
- Yeah?

707
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:51,520
Cause they sound like that.
They got that rich, thick...

708
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,490
What? I don't understand
what their...

709
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,490
Do you get this
a lot from labels?

710
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:58,900
- I know.
- And that's a rare fucking thing.

711
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,010
- Sounds great, man.
- Yeah?

712
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:43,510
That's sick. That fucking final
chorus is incredible.

713
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,140
- Well done, mate.
- Thanks.

714
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:48,010
- Teamwork.
- Teamwork makes the dream work.

715
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,260
So, this is Spike's mix that I did
when I went down to Spike's house.

716
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:04,560
Of it.

717
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,130
That's... Use that as a reference
and have everything the same volume.

718
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:14,070
And then in the solo, take out everything
but the guitar and Pino's bass

719
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,540
and my acoustic guitar,
and then keep the ride in.

720
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,250
And take the "chun, chun, chun"
piano out

721
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,250
and put the "ding, ding, ding"
guitar in the verse.

722
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,680
What song is that about?

723
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,590
That was "Perfect," which is the last
song to be finished for the album.

724
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:36,890
We did an orchestral version
with my brother

725
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:38,230
which was a bit too orchestral,

726
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:41,060
and then I did an acoustic version on
my own, which is a bit too acoustic.

727
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,200
So, we've now fused the two
and they sound great.

728
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,540
Yeah, the last song to be done on the
album and then we're mastering it.

729
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,570
- Tuesday. Thanks, man.
- The struggle is real.

730
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,840
Oh, I'm done by the way,
I'm all done.

731
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,310
No, you're good.
You're good, you're good.

732
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:58,220
Yeah, we're mastering it Tuesday

733
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,920
and then sending it
off to be printed.

734
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,750
- Are you excited about that?
- It's the album!

735
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,260
I keep listening to the radio
and being, like,

736
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,560
really like my competitive
side's coming back.

737
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:14,630
And I just can't wait to put
some music out so I can get...

738
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,170
I've had to...

739
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:22,310
I've had to sort of keep my
competitive side on the low this year.

740
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:27,040
You know, I did a couple of
singles for other people,

741
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,280
which sort of kept me going.

742
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,110
My main target's Adele now.

743
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:34,850
I think if you don't want to be
bigger than Adele,

744
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,250
then you're in the
wrong industry.

745
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:40,020
Think she's the target
for everyone.

746
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:43,030
I don't want to be the male
Adele, I want to be Adele.

747
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:47,200
Wanna just... overdo that,
so gotta sell 30 million.

748
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,100
That's easy.

749
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,780
Is this on?

750
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,920
One, two, oh, hello.

751
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,190
- Can I explain the bank to you?
- Yes.

752
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,790
- The bank button. Basically...
- What's the bank button?

753
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:14,660
This will light up and it will
give you five, six, seven, eight.

754
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,260
For the moment, we just put
a distorted guitar on key.

755
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:20,230
Then we put a reverb.

756
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,970
And then two more vocals.

757
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:25,340
So it's just a demo mode,

758
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,670
but you know how you're in five,
six, seven, eight by the light.

759
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:29,810
That's the only difference.

760
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,880
And when you record a loop,
these will give you undo layers,

761
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,750
so you can see the layers
with this one here.

762
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,850
Undo them, basically.

763
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:41,180
- Yeah. Couple of little new things, but...
- This is cool.

764
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,110
I think that's self-explanatory.
That just needs tightening.

765
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,670
I agree.

766
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:06,910
I always thought that "Castle on
the Hill" would be the opening.

767
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,280
- It's the obvious...
- No, I know.

768
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,450
But "Eraser" just sounds
so good on the album.

769
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:14,820
I don't know if "Eraser" is
gonna sound... good.

770
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,260
Doesn't feel like it, right?

771
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,960
No, doesn't, but
I don't know if it's...

772
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,990
I don't know if it
fits in the set yet.

773
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,130
I don't know.

774
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,770
I'm not super confident
about all the songs yet.

775
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,720
All right.

776
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,330
Yeah, I'm rehearsing.
Rehearsing the live show.

777
01:18:57,330 --> 01:19:00,060
Just having a year of not
really picking up a guitar

778
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,370
and playing those songs, It just
kind of, it's all gone away.

779
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:05,040
But, yeah,
I'll just have to practice them.

780
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:13,840
The album is done.

781
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,910
Finished, mixed,
mastered, handed in.

782
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:21,350
And it's first time I've ever had an
album and looked at the track listing

783
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,820
and be, like, I could never do better
than that in my wildest dreams.

784
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:29,290
It's the peak of my songwriting
and musical ability.

785
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:32,330
And it might be the peak,

786
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:35,300
it might be that I never get this again,
but I know that when I'm 70,

787
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,900
I'll look back and be,
"That's my finest bit of work."

788
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,810
I just have a weird sense
about this album that's gonna be

789
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:46,910
the career-defining album,
much more so than "Plus" and "Multiply".

790
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:49,810
You know, the last two albums
were building up to something,

791
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,780
and I feel like this
is the payoff.

792
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,450
This one, it definitely
feels... feels magical.

793
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:00,320
Can't think of a better
fucking way to spend it.

794
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,860
- We got one minute.
- Drumroll, drumroll!

795
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,100
Five, four,
three, two, one!

796
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:35,520
Ed! Ed! Ed Sheeran!

797
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,920
Why do his guitars get this
messed up?

798
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,130
I never actually planned to bring Benny,
he just invited himself.

799
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:52,600
He's like, "Hey, yo, I'm coming.

800
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
I'm coming on the road
with a studio bus."

801
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,010
And now he's here.

802
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,540
Have a good day, sir.

803
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:58,440
This is the guitar I learnt on.

804
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:31,630
It's a Christmas
present from Clapton.

805
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:10,310
Granddad would be proud.

806
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,130
"Subtract," maybe?
