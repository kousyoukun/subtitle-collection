1
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,312
Oh, I bet you got a lot of questions
rattling around in your head.

2
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:06,788
-How much money in the case?
-Anywhere between 350 and half a mil.

3
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,519
-And how much do you need, Val?
-We split it 50-50.

4
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:11,026
-How much?
-130 grand.

5
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:12,686
-We'll hit them on Friday.
-It's not enough.

6
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,822
-And how much do you need, Val?
- We split it 50-50.

7
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:16,695
-It's my money.
-Yeah, well, I'm up short.

8
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,291
My 70 grand, I want it back.

9
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:19,596
-60 short.
-70.

10
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,968
70, Val. It's 70 grand.
70, you dumb bastards.

11
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,623
Help the homeless.

12
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,503
Help the homeless.

13
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:59,233
Oh, that's small change. Why don't
you give me some big change?

14
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:01,734
Give a guy a break. What do you say?

15
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:03,074
Come on, now.

16
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:06,840
Oh, thanks, man. Oh...
Hey, what the fuck!

17
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,680
What are you...

18
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,289
Son of a... Motherfucker!

19
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:23,594
-What do I owe you?
-$2.98.

20
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:45,145
Son of a... Hey! Hey, my cigarettes!

21
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,746
Oh! Sorry, sir. Pardon me.

22
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,654
Thank you.

23
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:05,426
$100, $200, $300.

24
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:08,202
Have a nice day, Mr. Johnson.

25
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,734
Excellent fit, sir.

26
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,240
And how will you be paying?

27
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,197
Yeah, I'll give you $900 for this.

28
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:42,897
Let me see that Magnum.

29
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,135
That's it.

30
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:16,128
$500 and the gun.

31
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,779
-I'll need to see some lD.
-Of course.

32
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:39,625
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.
This card's been canceled.

33
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:41,691
lmpossible.

34
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,394
Well, I tried it twice.

35
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,367
-Do you have another form of payment?
-Try it again.

36
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:37,573
Porter, you're not dead.

37
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:49,686
Where's Val?

38
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:52,118
Gone. Moved out two months ago.

39
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:53,958
-Where?
-Don't know.

40
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,657
-Who's paying your rent?
-Val.

41
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,669
-Why?
-Payoff, I guess.

42
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,832
What, you guess? You don't know?

43
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:23,015
Damn it! You've got a fucking lot
of nerve coming around here

44
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:26,527
all fucking high and mighty. What,
you bring your whore with you, did you?

45
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,000
-No, no, no.
-Look at it!

46
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:43,045
Look, see. Look at that.
That's before we met, baby.

47
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,443
Think about it.

48
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,623
Oh, God.

49
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,529
Oh, God.

50
00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:16,306
-So, what are you gonna do, Porter?
-I'm gonna get my money back.

51
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,181
You mean, what am I gonna do to you.

52
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,320
Well, that depends on you.

53
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:31,953
Where's Val?

54
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,859
I told you, I don't know.

55
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:42,900
Did he ever buy his way back
into the syndicate?

56
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,134
Yeah.

57
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:50,370
How do you get your payoffs?

58
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:56,514
A messenger, first of every month,
leaves an envelope with cash in it.

59
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,294
So, who was she, anyway?
That girl in the picture.

60
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:13,161
I met her when I got out of prison.

61
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:17,440
I used to drive her,
keep her safe while she worked.

62
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,271
What were you, her pimp?

63
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:24,943
No, no.

64
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,342
We both worked for that asshole.

65
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:28,572
Not now.

66
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:31,540
Yeah.

67
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,382
You're cleaning up.

68
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:37,220
No.

69
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,965
Val still wants to talk to you.

70
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:07,662
Sorry, babe.

71
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:12,197
Shall I tell him to call back again?

72
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,500
No, I'll talk to him.

73
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:16,673
Shut him up, anyway.

74
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,874
Val.

75
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:25,020
Yeah, same as always. You?

76
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:26,854
Yeah, good, good.

77
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:30,150
Why? You there now?

78
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:36,865
Well, don't sweat it, Val.
I mean, we all look alike to them.

79
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:41,167
Same crew. The Chows.

80
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:43,269
Twice a week, Tuesday and Friday.

81
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:46,365
Always between 1 1 :00 and 1 2:00,
always the same route.

82
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,271
Chinese money laundering.

83
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:57,316
-How much money in the case?
-Anywhere between 350 and half a mil.

84
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:06,722
-And how much do you need, Val?
-We split it 50-50.

85
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:11,259
No, I mean, how much do you need to,
you know, buy your way back?

86
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,637
lnto the syndicate. How much?

87
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,001
-You mean the outfit?
-Whatever.

88
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,170
Jesus, you know everything.

89
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,080
Hi, sweetie.

90
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:29,217
1 30 grand.

91
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,158
The beauty of the Chows
is they won't go to the cops.

92
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:44,563
They keep everything in-house,
and they don't feel pain the way we do.

93
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,003
You notice anything
about those guys, Val?

94
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:48,468
They look nasty.

95
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:50,698
Probably all kung fu motherfuckers.

96
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:54,603
-Why? Did I miss something?
-They weren't wearing their seat belts.

97
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,874
We'll hit them on Friday.

98
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:16,527
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

99
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,010
Looky here.

100
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:14,455
How's that vinyl taste?

101
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:29,862
Val!

102
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:31,574
What?

103
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:48,950
The problem with kicking
the Chows' asses,

104
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,323
an hour later you wanna do it again.

105
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,387
Huh?

106
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,142
140 grand.

107
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,078
140 apiece.

108
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:14,442
Total.

109
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,247
Total?

110
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,222
That's... That's what? That's 70 grand?

111
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,389
-That's not enough.
-lt is for me.

112
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,123
I'm taking the next few months off.
Here's the bag, baby.

113
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,823
Yeah, well, I'm up short.

114
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:33,096
60 short. Fucking slants!

115
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:36,034
Should've hit them Tuesday. Fuck!

116
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:41,900
We got away clean
and got something to show for it.

117
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:46,380
Always be grateful for what you get.
Rule number one, Val.

118
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:48,976
Yeah.

119
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,550
Yeah. Rule number one.

120
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:03,390
What?

121
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:11,933
Everything's cool.

122
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:15,541
It's just not enough, all right?

123
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:17,311
It never is, Val.

124
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:21,247
Hey, baby, just put the money
in the car, will you?

125
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:31,960
I can't fucking believe it. We should...

126
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:34,825
You know... You know what?
You know what, Porter?

127
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,359
This is funny. This'll kill you.

128
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:43,900
It's always $140,000.

129
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:52,374
Someone ought to give me a PhD.

130
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:54,241
You...

131
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:56,980
Shit!

132
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:00,652
Jesus, Lynn,
wait till I'm out of the fucking way!

133
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,965
Okay, everything's cool, baby.

134
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:19,937
Oh! Oh!

135
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,470
You were great. You were great.

136
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:27,709
Everything's cool. Give me the... Okay.

137
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,512
Okay, okay, keep the gun.

138
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,917
That's it. Everything's cool.

139
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:35,419
Just like we planned. Come on.

140
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,425
Don't fall apart on me now.

141
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,095
There we go.

142
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:55,266
Oh, I bet you got a lot of questions
rattling around in your head.

143
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,412
I don't know, pally.

144
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:06,079
I guess wives get funny
when it comes to girlfriends, huh?

145
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,116
What?

146
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,059
I didn't get that.

147
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:15,995
You got it.

148
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:54,226
Come on, Miss Porter,
I don't have all day!

149
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:17,422
ls... Is Miss Porter here?

150
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:19,956
Mrs. Porter.

151
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,095
Yeah, whatever.

152
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,572
You motherfucker!

153
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,377
Get up, turn around.

154
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:37,409
Come on. Get up. Come on.

155
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:44,985
What have we got here, huh?

156
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:50,016
-How much in here, huh?
-There's two grand.

157
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:51,388
What's in here?

158
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:54,019
Helium. What the fuck you think it is?
It's heroin.

159
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,290
Oh, fuck!

160
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:04,998
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

161
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:06,566
Fuck!

162
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:08,942
Val Resnick.

163
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,813
Where is he?

164
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:14,513
You wanna know where he is?

165
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:19,178
He's right here. Look. Look. Fuck you.

166
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:20,778
Wrong answer.

167
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,758
Shit! You motherfucker!

168
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:27,626
-Fuck!
-Val Resnick.

169
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,598
I never heard of him, man. Fuck.

170
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,135
Where'd you get the envelope
and the shit?

171
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,398
Come on, man,
they're gonna fucking kill me.

172
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:38,269
They're gonna kill me, man.

173
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,213
What do you think I'm gonna do?

174
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,642
Worry about me.

175
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:48,283
Oh, come on. Okay.

176
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:50,079
Okay, okay, okay.

177
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:53,684
Stegman... Stegman, man.
Arthur fucking Stegman. Okay?

178
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,455
Where is he?

179
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,651
Southend Taxi.

180
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:01,262
Farragut Road, man.

181
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:06,361
Thanks.

182
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,494
You're welcome.

183
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,897
I'm looking for Arthur Stegman.

184
00:24:35,164 --> 00:24:37,689
He ain't here.
Something I can help you with?

185
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:40,800
No, you can't. Where is he?

186
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,568
I don't know. He ain't here.

187
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:47,002
Take a guess.

188
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:49,102
What?

189
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:53,482
Take a guess about where he is.

190
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:04,921
Is he at home?

191
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,133
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

192
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,601
All right, here we go.

193
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:17,229
Hey, come on, roll it!

194
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,640
-Wait a minute. That was mine!
-lt was not yours, man.

195
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,108
I get one more shot.

196
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,375
There's somebody here to see you.

197
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,450
I'm looking for Stegman.

198
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:41,919
Who the hell are you?

199
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:43,623
I'm Porter.

200
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,463
Well, Porter,
that looks like assault to me.

201
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:54,573
Porter looks to me like the kind
that likes to resist arrest.

202
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,738
-Hey!
-Whoa!

203
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,974
Fuck, no! Not in here.

204
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:02,346
Jesus, guys, he just... He wants to talk.

205
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:05,079
Am I right? Did I call it?

206
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:10,616
Are you Stegman?

207
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:14,696
Maybe. What do you want?

208
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:18,492
Your boy didn't make his delivery.

209
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:20,824
Jesus.

210
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:22,837
Whoa, Artie.

211
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:25,533
Hey, listen, don't worry about it.
Why don't we talk outside?

212
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:27,233
Artie, you're a dealer?

213
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,175
Just forget about it, all right?

214
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,876
And don't touch my money, either.

215
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,142
-Come on. Let's...
-This is heroin?

216
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:39,914
-This is heroin.
-Guys, just...

217
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:43,924
Don't worry about it, all right?
Just take it easy. Let's talk. Come on.

218
00:26:45,294 --> 00:26:47,819
What are you guys looking at?
Play your game.

219
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:51,830
And you're bleeding all over my couch.
Come on, you. Come on.

220
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,966
Steggie's been holding out on us.

221
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,843
I'll check it out.

222
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:05,272
Val Resnick.

223
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:10,178
-What about him?
-You're gonna tell me where he is.

224
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:13,278
No. No. Even if I knew,
the answer would still be no.

225
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:15,619
Now, where'd you meet up
with my delivery boy?

226
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:16,749
At his drop.

227
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:17,951
Is he dead?

228
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,257
No, but she is. OD'd on that crap
you've been sending her.

229
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:23,053
So?

230
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:25,990
-What do you care?
-I'm her husband.

231
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:30,438
You're not gonna fucking kill me,
are you?

232
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,105
Not in front of these kids.

233
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,478
Where is he?

234
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:44,384
I don't know.

235
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:45,711
That's the truth.

236
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:48,483
You see, this stuff gets delivered to me,
too, you know. Last night.

237
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:51,116
And I won't see anyone again
till next month.

238
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:54,462
Why all the trouble?

239
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:56,859
Well, he's afraid of the girl.

240
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,732
You know, I mean, of... Of Mrs. Porter.

241
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:06,797
Look, I don't know nothing
about this, okay?

242
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:08,706
I know Val from the old days.

243
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:11,746
Three months ago he shows up,
asks me to do him a favor.

244
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:15,180
I make an extra grand a month,
so I figure, what the hell, right?

245
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:17,218
Now you come around
threatening to kill me?

246
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:20,049
Believe me,
that much a buddy of Val's, I am not.

247
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:22,481
He's in the city. That's it.
That's all I know.

248
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:25,560
-I got a game going on in here.
-How do you know that?

249
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:26,885
He said so.

250
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,055
-When?
-When he... Then.

251
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,154
When he came around.

252
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:32,359
Said that he squared himself
with the syndicate.

253
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:34,231
Said he was back in the big time.

254
00:28:34,336 --> 00:28:36,736
Back for good. He was very excited.

255
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,637
Well, you tell him
that Porter is back, too,

256
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:42,706
and he wants his money,
Porter wants his money.

257
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:44,279
Or I'll come back here
and pay you a visit

258
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,746
-when these kids are not around.
-Well...

259
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:51,042
When would I tell him this?

260
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,306
Talk to me.

261
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:18,035
There's a young lady to see you, sir.
Her name is Pearl.

262
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,441
She's got two very bad habits.

263
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:23,518
Right now,
I'm only interested in one of them.

264
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:25,651
Send her up.

265
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:31,917
Apartment 71 8, ma'am. Go right on up.

266
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:54,544
-Send her up. What's the problem?
-Hey, Val, it's Haskell.

267
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,413
Sorry to be calling you at home,
but I thought...

268
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,783
Don't be sorry, sweetie. Just don't call.

269
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,617
Well, I thought it might be important.

270
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:03,157
I got a call from a cab guy
out in the south end.

271
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,386
-What is it?
-Well, it's this guy, Stegman.

272
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:07,359
Shit. Hold on a second.

273
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:19,236
On your knees, bitch.
I want satisfaction.

274
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:22,171
I'm on the phone, Pearl.

275
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:28,709
That's Mistress Pearl,
you piece of dog shit.

276
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,979
I'm on the fucking phone!

277
00:30:35,524 --> 00:30:37,219
Make it quick, huh?

278
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:40,659
So, anyhow, this guy Stegman called.
He sounded all nervous.

279
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:44,057
Sounded like something
scared the shit out of him.

280
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:47,693
He said he had to talk to you.
I said I'd see what I could do, Val.

281
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,438
Y eah? Did he tell you
what it was about?

282
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:52,700
He said to tell you Lynn was dead.

283
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:55,868
He said some guy came around
talking mean and wanted you.

284
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:59,209
And that's all he said.
I thought you ought to know.

285
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,716
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did right.
I wanna talk to that son of a bitch.

286
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:04,251
Who, Stegman?

287
00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:08,187
No, President Nixon.
Of course Stegman.

288
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:11,057
T ell him Varrick's by the bridge.

289
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,557
Make it...

290
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:16,497
Make it 20 minutes, huh?

291
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:31,338
-Steggie.
-Hey, Val.

292
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:32,607
You know, I tried to call you,

293
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:35,115
but you must have changed your
number again. 'Cause I got nothing.

294
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:38,812
I never gave you
my original number, Steg.

295
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:41,447
What did this guy look like?

296
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:44,788
Well, he had, like, dark hair, blue eyes.

297
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:47,590
He was like
a real Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.

298
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:50,256
Well, if Lynn's dead,
maybe he did us a favor, huh?

299
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,301
I know what you mean, except
I'm out like a grand a month, you know?

300
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:55,700
Well, maybe we can
work something out.

301
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:58,033
Did you get a name?

302
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:00,800
He said his name was Porter.

303
00:32:01,877 --> 00:32:03,504
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

304
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:08,409
-He said he was there for Porter?
-No. No, he said he was Porter.

305
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:16,057
Yeah. I'll tell you something.

306
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:19,284
I wouldn't want that guy after me, either.
I know how you must feel.

307
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,693
What am l, a nobody?

308
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:23,990
-No.
-I've got friends.

309
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:26,093
All I have to do is point.

310
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,965
I pick up a phone, say his name,
and he's a dead man.

311
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,902
And this time he stays dead!

312
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:33,839
All right, Val, try to keep it down.
All right?

313
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:35,240
It's okay.

314
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,713
-What did he say about me?
-He just... Nothing.

315
00:32:38,814 --> 00:32:42,341
-He just said you owed him money.
-Not why? Nothing else?

316
00:32:42,484 --> 00:32:43,678
Nothing.

317
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:47,318
-Why? How much you owe him?
-None of your goddamn business.

318
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:49,215
Well, I just, you know...

319
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,987
I got the feeling
he'd like to kill you, that's all.

320
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:53,425
Oh, Christ.

321
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:55,756
Porter.

322
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,328
What?

323
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:04,769
What did you tell him?

324
00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:07,137
Nothing. What could I tell him?

325
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,800
You tell him about the money?
The heroin?

326
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:11,607
He had it with him.

327
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:13,113
I just... I told him I delivered it.

328
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:16,548
-You didn't tell him nothing else?
-I don't know nothing else.

329
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:19,213
Nah. You gave him something.

330
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:21,917
A name, maybe.
Someone who knows where to find me.

331
00:33:22,024 --> 00:33:25,460
-I swear, Val, on my mother...
-Hey, fuck your mother!

332
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:29,426
Hey, that's not nice.
Now, why don't you try to take it easy?

333
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:31,158
-What the fuck you looking at?
-Take it easy.

334
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:33,291
Val, don't. Come on. Not again.
Don't do that.

335
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:36,394
-What the fuck you looking at?
-No, Val, no. Come on. Not again.

336
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:39,133
-What the fuck are you looking at?
-Val, come on, don't. Not again.

337
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:41,334
-Come on, just forget it.
-ls there some trouble here?

338
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:43,911
No, you know what? We're...
We're just... We're leaving.

339
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:45,241
We're leaving.

340
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:48,282
You know what, Val?
This one's on me, okay?

341
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,045
You see me reaching
for my fucking wallet?

342
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:51,141
No.

343
00:33:55,357 --> 00:33:59,054
-Hey, pal, is there a Michael here?
-That's him over yonder.

344
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:02,891
Michael.

345
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:06,859
I'm told you're the man to see
about expensive horizontal refreshment.

346
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:09,096
I'm looking for a girl named Rosie.

347
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:13,673
Prostitution is illegal,
and you're speaking Greek.

348
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:20,873
Usually these matters are conducted
with more discretion.

349
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,145
Be discreet now.

350
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,561
-What was her name again?
-Rosie.

351
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:36,187
And who should I say is looking for her?

352
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:37,765
Just call her.

353
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,601
-Rosie?
-Yeah.

354
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,337
Give me the phone.

355
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,238
Here.

356
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:54,646
Take care of that.

357
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:58,045
-Rosie.
-Who the hell is this?

358
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,682
-Porter.
-Try again, honey. Porter's dead.

359
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:06,692
I used to drive for you,
provide a safe work environment.

360
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:08,823
Porter?

361
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:10,921
Yeah.

362
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:51,696
Hi.

363
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,905
Come on. Come in.

364
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:01,905
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

365
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,687
-How'd you hear about it?
-People who know were talking.

366
00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:15,253
Plus, I heard
your wife was back in town alone.

367
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:18,163
She's dead.

368
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,228
I'm sorry, Porter.

369
00:36:22,704 --> 00:36:23,728
Why?

370
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,667
Jesus. Surly Porter.
You're the same as ever, aren't you?

371
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:35,274
This doesn't look like you.

372
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,643
Yeah, well, people change.

373
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:42,021
Stay. It's okay, baby. It's okay.

374
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:44,625
Come on, sweetheart. It's okay.

375
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,824
Meet the nastiest damn dog
who ever lived.

376
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,467
-What's his name?
-Porter.

377
00:36:54,336 --> 00:36:56,429
He took your job after you left.

378
00:36:56,538 --> 00:36:59,701
He's just as tough,
but he won't leave me, will you, baby?

379
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,174
I need a favor.

380
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:12,347
A favor?

381
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:15,555
Maybe you're not the same as ever.

382
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:21,025
I'm looking for a syndicate boy.

383
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,792
It's the outfit, baby.
We don't say syndicate anymore.

384
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,334
Well, you know what I mean.
Whatever the hell you call it.

385
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:29,927
Don't get touchy, Porter.
What's his name?

386
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:32,271
Val Resnick.

387
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,644
Oh, that son of a bitch.

388
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:39,937
-You know him?
-Yeah.

389
00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:43,778
I met up with him once a few years ago.

390
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:47,251
He can't use Star Service anymore
because he beats up all the girls.

391
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:49,153
He almost killed one.

392
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:51,383
You?

393
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:58,929
Does it matter?
You quit looking after me, remember?

394
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:04,806
Would you happen to have a line
on where he might be?

395
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:05,170
Would you happen to have a line
on where he might be?

396
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:10,743
-I suppose he's at the hotel.
-Which one?

397
00:38:10,846 --> 00:38:13,007
The outfit hotel. They're all there.

398
00:38:14,316 --> 00:38:16,011
You got an address?

399
00:38:17,886 --> 00:38:19,649
We're friends, right?

400
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,386
I mean, we used to be.

401
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:24,383
But I'm an employee, too,

402
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:26,393
and I don't think
the outfit would like me telling you

403
00:38:26,495 --> 00:38:27,826
where the hotel was, would they?

404
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,591
-No. What do you think I'm gonna do?
-How strong are you, Porter?

405
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:34,499
Personally, I think you are
the strongest man I have ever met.

406
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:36,996
But I wonder if it's enough.

407
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:38,700
For what?

408
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:43,338
If I know you, you want this Resnick guy
for something he won't like.

409
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:45,208
Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.

410
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,314
That's something he won't like.

411
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:54,452
What if something goes wrong,
and they grab you

412
00:38:54,556 --> 00:38:56,717
and they ask you
where you found out about the hotel?

413
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:59,453
Why are we even talking about this?
You know I wouldn't turn you in.

414
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:01,358
I wouldn't talk about who told me what.

415
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:03,658
But what if they ask you hard?

416
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,966
I'll tell them it was a cab dispatcher
named Stegman.

417
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:14,773
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 1 7th.

418
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:26,721
All this time, you don't even pretend
to ask how I've been.

419
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:32,183
You need any cash or anything?

420
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:40,198
Get yourself killed, prick.
I ought to tell him you're coming.

421
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:18,633
Hi, Val.

422
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:22,701
Where's my money?

423
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,915
No, it's not there. I took your gun.
It's back here.

424
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:33,454
You look like a pro.

425
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:36,524
You keep your mouth shut,
and you'll walk out of here.

426
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,993
My 70 grand, I want it.

427
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,024
I don't have it right now.

428
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:47,860
Where is it?

429
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:52,633
I gave all $130,000 to the outfit.
I gave it all to them.

430
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,709
Well, tell them you gave them
money that doesn't belong to you,

431
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,472
and get it back.

432
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:04,016
Now, Porter, I can't do that.
I mean, you don't know these...

433
00:41:05,454 --> 00:41:08,719
You're gonna kill me
whether I get the money or not.

434
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,688
All right, I'll get it. I'll get it.
I'll get the money.

435
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:13,283
Just give me a few days, all right?

436
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:15,488
What the fuck are you doing?

437
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:19,299
Noon. Tomorrow. Say it.

438
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:20,994
All right.

439
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:25,129
You know, this may sound crazy, Porter,
but no hard feelings, huh?

440
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:28,870
I did what I had to do.
You could appreciate that.

441
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,873
Yeah, I appreciate that,
you son of a bitch.

442
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:32,606
No, no, no. Don't.

443
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:36,279
Please. Allow me.

444
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:46,752
Jesus. God.

445
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:53,892
God.

446
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:56,502
You bitch!

447
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:00,607
Let her work.

448
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:15,883
Me love you, baby.

449
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:19,986
Me love you long time.

450
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,296
Wait up, hon. Wait.

451
00:42:34,576 --> 00:42:36,567
Tomorrow. Noon.

452
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:41,581
You and the money, be at the corner
of 7th and Franklin at the pay phone.

453
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,179
Okay. Okay.

454
00:42:47,322 --> 00:42:49,085
Where'd you get this?

455
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,324
Some hooker had it on her shelf.

456
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:56,426
I recognized you.
I swiped it in case I could use it.

457
00:42:56,531 --> 00:42:58,123
Did you hurt her?

458
00:42:59,134 --> 00:43:01,295
The hooker, did you hurt her?

459
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:04,065
What does that have to do
with anything?

460
00:43:12,347 --> 00:43:14,247
I've got a few minutes.

461
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,077
So go boil an egg.

462
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:31,755
Can I help you?

463
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:37,966
Val Resnick.
I got an appointment with Mr. Carter.

464
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:40,465
Yes.

465
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:43,669
Turn around, please.

466
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:45,268
Listen, sweetie,
you don't have to do that.

467
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,779
Turn around.

468
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:50,949
Thank you.

469
00:44:01,162 --> 00:44:03,187
-Very nice.
-You like that?

470
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:10,099
-It's down there.
-Yes.

471
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,365
This isn't how
Mr. Carter likes his visitors.

472
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:15,670
I know.

473
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:18,774
It's just I'm in a little bit of trouble
right now.

474
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,178
Yes, Mr. Carter thinks so, too.

475
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:24,211
This way, please.

476
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:28,549
Philip tells me you have a problem
you need help with.

477
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,352
Yes, sir.

478
00:44:31,326 --> 00:44:35,126
Is it your problem who breached
our security last night at the Oakwood?

479
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,458
Yes, sir.

480
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:38,494
Then he breaks into my apartment...

481
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,125
There's three ways
that we can handle this.

482
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:43,397
One, we can help you.

483
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:46,707
Two, we can allow you to help yourself.

484
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:49,333
And three, we can have you replaced.

485
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,875
We have an investment in you, Resnick.

486
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:58,351
So assisting you would be,
in a way, protecting our investment.

487
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:02,383
And that is always
good business policy.

488
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:07,188
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.
Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.

489
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:08,886
Now,

490
00:45:11,232 --> 00:45:14,759
according to Philip,
a man has come to town to kill you?

491
00:45:14,903 --> 00:45:15,927
Yes, sir.

492
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:18,972
And you say that he's alone
and that he's a professional robber.

493
00:45:19,074 --> 00:45:20,098
Is that correct?

494
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:24,167
Yes, sir. He does payroll jobs, banks,
you know, stuff like that.

495
00:45:24,446 --> 00:45:26,437
-What's his name?
-Porter.

496
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,942
Well, what's his first name?

497
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:34,947
You know, I don't know it.

498
00:45:35,056 --> 00:45:37,183
He never called himself
anything but Porter.

499
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:52,336
Where did you get the $130,000?

500
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:58,641
That's why
this man has come to town, huh?

501
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:01,605
The $130,000 that you paid us back?

502
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:04,677
Yes, sir, but only $70,000 of it was his.

503
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:07,277
Well, we never asked you
where you got the money.

504
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:09,049
It was none of our business.

505
00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:12,217
But now it appears
it has become our business.

506
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,123
Here's his file, Mr. Carter.

507
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,669
Do you understand your value
to the organization, Resnick?

508
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:35,410
You're a sadist. You lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

509
00:46:36,017 --> 00:46:38,986
But now you've allowed an area
of your personal life

510
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,055
to become a danger to us.

511
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:47,090
A man in our organization
needs to be tough and self-reliant.

512
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,597
Were you to handle this problem
on your own,

513
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:55,635
there would be no doubt

514
00:46:57,472 --> 00:46:59,497
that you're the kind of man we want.

515
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:00,904
I want to.

516
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:04,270
-I want to handle it myself, Mr. Carter.
-Great.

517
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:06,673
Until the matter is handled,

518
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:09,579
I want you to move out
of the Oakwood Arms.

519
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,151
But I don't have a place...

520
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:17,383
I don't want any more unpleasantness
at the hotel.

521
00:47:19,694 --> 00:47:20,922
Yes, sir.

522
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,060
That's it. Val's in the doghouse, Spider.

523
00:47:24,165 --> 00:47:25,962
I'll fill you in on the way.

524
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:30,134
He loves me. Let's go.

525
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,834
He doesn't love you, Val.

526
00:47:33,174 --> 00:47:35,665
Sorry. We've been reassigned.

527
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:39,641
Go ahead.

528
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:43,781
After last night, I'm safer without you.
Look at me. Look at this.

529
00:47:43,885 --> 00:47:45,819
What the fuck good are you, huh?

530
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,512
Get out of here.

531
00:47:47,856 --> 00:47:50,518
Never forget a pussy's face,
you remember that.

532
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:54,522
I'll do it myself.

533
00:47:56,764 --> 00:48:00,393
Do it myself. You want it done right!

534
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:03,035
You got to do it yourself!

535
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,903
It's the American way!

536
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:16,811
-Yes?
-Did your friends make it to town?

537
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:19,746
Oh, yeah. Last night, baby.

538
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,248
Good. Now, did you tell them
it was Porter took that payroll?

539
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,021
I did. And they want retribution.

540
00:48:27,795 --> 00:48:30,127
All right. All right. Here's what we do.

541
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:33,388
Oh, shit.

542
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:57,309
Shit.

543
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:03,455
Next time, Porter.

544
00:50:07,595 --> 00:50:10,029
Looks like Porter's
made some new friends.

545
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,574
-Easy, mister.
-I'm okay. I don't want to press charges.

546
00:50:31,686 --> 00:50:33,813
-Who were they, pal?
-I don't know. I don't know.

547
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:36,856
All right. I don't wanna...
Oh, it's you guys.

548
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,859
Our buddy Stegman says you got a line
on a load of cash there, Porter.

549
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:41,861
250 grand, to be exact.

550
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:44,120
70.

551
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,628
-Come on, man. Get off of me.
-All right, all right, all right.

552
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:51,296
What do you take us for, huh? ldiots?

553
00:50:51,939 --> 00:50:54,134
Nobody'd go through all this shit
for 70 grand.

554
00:50:54,242 --> 00:50:55,573
We don't like trouble, buddy.

555
00:50:55,676 --> 00:50:57,473
You look like a whole bunch of trouble
to us.

556
00:50:57,578 --> 00:50:59,808
We found a dead girl full of heroin.

557
00:50:59,914 --> 00:51:01,313
There were signs of a struggle,

558
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:03,577
and the coroner's not so sure
it was an OD.

559
00:51:03,684 --> 00:51:05,447
We got a witness, though.

560
00:51:05,553 --> 00:51:07,418
A guy with only one nostril.
Remember him?

561
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,511
Yeah.

562
00:51:08,623 --> 00:51:11,524
Hey, don't worry, Porter.
We're gonna give you immunity.

563
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:13,924
Room to operate,
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

564
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:16,496
All you got to do is get the money.

565
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:18,892
Oh, we can't help you, though.

566
00:51:19,801 --> 00:51:22,861
-lt'd be against the law.
-You understand, Porter?

567
00:51:23,438 --> 00:51:25,668
-It's my money.
-Wrong, Porter.

568
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,932
Fuck!

569
00:51:27,909 --> 00:51:30,742
It's our money, Porter.
Me and my partner's money.

570
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:32,904
You be a good boy,
we'll give you a piece.

571
00:51:33,014 --> 00:51:34,413
It will be easy, Porter.

572
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:36,647
You got it?

573
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:39,248
-Yeah, he's got it.
-You understand?

574
00:51:40,354 --> 00:51:41,878
You take it easy, huh? We'll be in touch.

575
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:43,422
Sure, thanks.

576
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,220
Fuck.

577
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,299
Jesus Christ, Porter,
you need to see a doctor.

578
00:52:31,405 --> 00:52:32,463
Yeah.

579
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,339
-It's gonna sting.
-Just clean it up, all right?

580
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,470
-You hold it there.
-Yeah, right.

581
00:52:52,026 --> 00:52:53,357
I'll do it.

582
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,191
Tell me something, Porter.

583
00:53:03,604 --> 00:53:07,631
When did you decide to leave?
Was it that night we slept together?

584
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,099
No.

585
00:53:12,547 --> 00:53:15,812
It was the next day
when I had to drive you to work.

586
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:23,019
You could have asked me to quit.

587
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:30,460
You could have asked me to drive you
somewhere else.

588
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,187
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

589
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:55,728
Thanks.

590
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,900
-Does it fit?
-Oh, yeah.

591
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:01,707
Like it was made for me.

592
00:54:02,943 --> 00:54:05,241
lt'll look great in your casket.

593
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,021
You know what I think?

594
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:22,862
I think that all those stories
about you being dead were true.

595
00:54:22,997 --> 00:54:25,761
You're just too thick-headed to admit it.

596
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,259
Porter. God, I missed you.

597
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:58,531
I missed you.

598
00:55:07,174 --> 00:55:09,506
-Don't talk. Don't.
-Oh, no, l...

599
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:12,409
I can't. I got...

600
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:16,679
Stuff to do. I got...

601
00:56:00,461 --> 00:56:01,621
Porter.

602
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:10,267
Where is he?

603
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:15,870
Porter. Where is he?

604
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,406
He's in the bedroom.

605
00:56:33,994 --> 00:56:35,484
Is he hurt bad?

606
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:39,891
The doctor should be here any minute.

607
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,963
No. That's bullshit.

608
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:59,609
Porter, here I come, pally.

609
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:01,214
Porter!

610
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:06,526
Goddamn!

611
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:13,665
Get in there!

612
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,175
-Where is he?
-He's gone!

613
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:24,139
He's gone. He's gone.

614
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:25,541
Gone, huh?

615
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:32,442
I know you.
You're that whore from the picture.

616
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:35,980
Yeah.

617
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:37,919
How do you know him?

618
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:40,021
He used to drive me.

619
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:41,920
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

620
00:57:44,732 --> 00:57:47,098
I'm driving you now, honey.

621
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:50,969
-You know what you are?
-Educate me.

622
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:52,163
Okay.

623
00:57:52,272 --> 00:57:56,003
An ugly pig who beats up women
on account he can't get it up

624
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,840
'cause he's too terrified
of his own fucking shadow!

625
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:00,140
-ls that right?
-Yep!

626
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,509
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

627
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:03,776
Then I guess you must be the lucky girl.

628
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,816
Sweetie, I am gonna fuck you
six ways from Sunday.

629
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:30,269
Jesus.

630
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:35,309
Forgot my cigarettes.

631
00:58:40,788 --> 00:58:41,880
Shit.

632
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:47,392
All right, Val.

633
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:51,254
This syndicate, or outfit
or whatever the hell you call it,

634
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:52,798
it's got a head man, right?

635
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:54,965
Who is it?

636
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,030
They'll kill me, Porter.

637
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:59,435
What do you think I'm gonna do to you?
Worry about me.

638
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,905
Goddamn!

639
00:59:02,075 --> 00:59:03,599
Names. Come on.

640
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:06,078
Fairfax and Carter.

641
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,205
Fairfax and Carter.
They run the whole city.

642
00:59:08,315 --> 00:59:09,714
Fairfax and Carter.

643
00:59:09,817 --> 00:59:11,114
Where do I find them?

644
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,919
Fairfax isn't in town right now.

645
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:17,148
What about Carter? Where is he?
Is he in town?

646
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:21,059
Porter, it won't do you any good.

647
00:59:21,161 --> 00:59:23,595
They're gonna... Jesus! You...

648
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:29,798
Frederick Carter lnvestments.
120 Commerce Avenue.

649
00:59:31,638 --> 00:59:33,572
Hey, thanks. There they are.

650
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:38,301
All right. All right!

651
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:41,037
I'll help you out.

652
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:45,943
You're fucking nuts going up
against the outfit for 70 grand,

653
00:59:46,053 --> 00:59:48,248
-but I'm gonna help you out.
-Yeah?

654
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,681
Here. Keep talking.

655
00:59:53,327 --> 00:59:55,022
Thanks. l...

656
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,961
I can get you in there.
Place is tighter than a drum.

657
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,433
-How many guys in there?
-But, well...

658
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:04,094
It's tighter than hell.

659
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:06,172
They got only one guy
on the outside, though,

660
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,104
so I got a way around...

661
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:15,742
You are crazy.
You are a crazy son of a bitch.

662
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:17,946
-That's why I love you.
-Yep.

663
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:21,486
-You got a light?
-l... What?

664
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:23,186
You got a light?

665
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,288
No. No.

666
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:30,123
-Well, then what good are you?
-Wait!

667
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:54,880
Rosie.

668
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:57,048
Rosie.

669
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:01,026
Is your name on the lease here?

670
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:08,157
The outfit.
The outfit pays for everything.

671
01:01:09,803 --> 01:01:12,772
I want you to gather everything up
that you need,

672
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,871
say goodbye to this place.

673
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:16,801
Okay?

674
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:53,911
-I told you he'd show up.
-Give me my goddamn money, please.

675
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,641
Yeah, give me my money, too.

676
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,984
Give me my goddamn money, please.

677
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:01,145
-Sure that's him?
-Yeah, that's him, come on.

678
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:03,751
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

679
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:05,757
Yeah, there you go.

680
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,488
-What you up to, buddy?
-Well, our money's in there

681
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:12,191
if you're still interested.

682
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:16,167
Well, not in the dough
but the boat I'm gonna buy with it.

683
01:02:19,606 --> 01:02:23,804
-What's he doing here?
-It's a ride-along, Porter.

684
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:27,012
You see, your piece of the pie
just got a little smaller.

685
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:29,548
But don't worry,
I'll leave you some crust.

686
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:35,912
What are you waiting for, Porter?
Go get it. Go get our money.

687
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:41,488
-You guys do me a favor?
-We're here to help, buddy.

688
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:44,353
Well, they're probably gonna frisk me
when I go in there,

689
01:02:44,464 --> 01:02:46,955
so I wonder if you wouldn't mind
holding on to this.

690
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,193
Jesus.

691
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:50,893
You know, just for a little while.

692
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:53,432
Sure, Porter.

693
01:02:56,643 --> 01:02:58,907
Hey, nice balance.

694
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:03,607
Douche bag.

695
01:03:12,993 --> 01:03:14,221
Can I help you?

696
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:17,826
-Yeah, I want to see Mr. Carter.
-And who are you?

697
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:21,225
Tell him I'm the guy
that whacked Val Resnick.

698
01:03:21,535 --> 01:03:22,729
I'm sorry, I don't...

699
01:03:24,538 --> 01:03:26,130
Didn't copy. Repeat.

700
01:03:30,343 --> 01:03:31,503
Right.

701
01:03:33,013 --> 01:03:36,380
Mr. Carter will see you.
Turn around so I can frisk you.

702
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:42,583
So you popped old Val, huh?

703
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,683
Thanks. Left pocket.

704
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:53,699
-Saving up?
-Yeah, every little bit helps.

705
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:56,059
Follow me.

706
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:19,519
Bravo. Sit down.

707
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:28,025
My compliments.
They were two of my best.

708
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:30,194
No, they lull too easy.

709
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,272
48.

710
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:45,078
There's something you want from me.

711
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:48,416
Val Resnick gave you $1 30,000.

712
01:04:48,522 --> 01:04:50,080
Paid us. It was a debt.

713
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:54,292
Well, $70,000 of it was mine,
and I want it back.

714
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:59,457
I'm sorry. Resnick told me, but
I seem to have misplaced your name.

715
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:01,761
-Porter.
-Porter. Right.

716
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:03,930
I won't forget it again.

717
01:05:05,138 --> 01:05:07,436
The outfit is not unreasonable, Porter,

718
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:12,103
but no corporation in the world
would agree to what you're asking.

719
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:14,840
What about Fairfax?
Will he give me my money?

720
01:05:15,782 --> 01:05:18,182
Resnick told you quite a bit, didn't he?

721
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:20,219
Fairfax will tell you
the same thing I have.

722
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,618
We're not authorized
to do things like this.

723
01:05:22,722 --> 01:05:25,714
-Who is? Who makes the decisions?
-Well, a committee would make

724
01:05:25,825 --> 01:05:28,385
-a decision in this case.
-No, no. One man.

725
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:31,020
You go high enough,
you always come to one man. Who?

726
01:05:42,709 --> 01:05:45,610
Yeah, Fred Carter.
I wanna talk to Bronson.

727
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:54,286
Yeah, sorry to bother you,
but I have a problem.

728
01:05:54,754 --> 01:05:57,279
There's a man in my office with a gun
who says he's gonna kill me

729
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:00,052
if the outfit doesn't pay him $130,000...

730
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,119
$70,000. It's 70... Let me talk to him.

731
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:07,222
Her.

732
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:13,633
He wants to speak to you.

733
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:18,369
The speaker.

734
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:26,751
This is Bronson.

735
01:06:26,853 --> 01:06:29,447
How much is this guy Carter
worth to you?

736
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:31,854
Worth? What do you mean?

737
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:34,358
Well, either I get my money,
or I'll kill Carter.

738
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:36,828
I don't like to be threatened.

739
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,989
I'm not threatening you,
I'm threatening Carter.

740
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:40,088
Touche.

741
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,293
An audacious man. Who are you?

742
01:06:42,802 --> 01:06:44,565
My money, yes or no?

743
01:06:46,706 --> 01:06:47,695
No.

744
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:53,675
Carter? Carter?

745
01:06:54,714 --> 01:06:56,375
Carter, what's happening?

746
01:06:57,450 --> 01:07:00,010
Get some people down
to Commerce street. Now.

747
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,412
Carter?

748
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:04,549
Speak to me. Carter?

749
01:07:04,658 --> 01:07:07,650
You just don't get it, do you,
you dumb fuck?

750
01:07:09,195 --> 01:07:11,720
I sure hope you're talking to him
and not me.

751
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,799
Carter! Carter!

752
01:07:13,933 --> 01:07:15,059
I just croaked Carter.

753
01:07:15,168 --> 01:07:17,398
I want you to call Fairfax
and tell him that.

754
01:07:17,504 --> 01:07:19,335
Smoke them if you got 'em, asshole.

755
01:07:19,906 --> 01:07:21,999
You've got 24 hours left to breathe.

756
01:07:22,108 --> 01:07:25,373
That's one day to get
your tiny little world in order.

757
01:07:25,478 --> 01:07:28,276
Do you understand that, sweetheart?
Do you?

758
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:31,010
Porter, Porter, Porter, get my money.

759
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:34,084
-I see him, I see him, I see him.
-Come on, come on, come on.

760
01:07:34,187 --> 01:07:35,347
Right here.

761
01:07:38,024 --> 01:07:40,891
-I don't see any cash.
-They write you a check?

762
01:07:41,328 --> 01:07:44,092
They gave me the run around.
I have to go and see another guy.

763
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:46,757
Last one, then we got a dead woman,
an assault,

764
01:07:46,866 --> 01:07:49,460
and all kinds of stuff
to talk to you about.

765
01:07:49,569 --> 01:07:53,027
That means more paperwork, Porter,
and we don't like paperwork.

766
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,638
Damn shame, Porter,
but don't let the bastards get you down.

767
01:07:59,012 --> 01:08:01,446
That's right, Porter. Don't give up.

768
01:08:04,718 --> 01:08:07,414
-Hey, can I have my piece back?
-Oh, yeah.

769
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:20,188
Nice roscoe, Porter.
Heavy enough to be a nutcracker.

770
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,061
We'll be in touch, Rocky.

771
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:25,895
Keep up the good work.

772
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:28,166
Rocky? Where did you get Rocky from?

773
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:31,107
Squirrel on the cartoon.
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

774
01:09:19,225 --> 01:09:21,523
Good to have you back in town,
Mr. Fairfax.

775
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:23,289
I wish I could say I was glad to be back.

776
01:09:23,396 --> 01:09:25,956
I was swimming with the dolphins
this morning.

777
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:28,758
Easy, would you?

778
01:09:28,868 --> 01:09:31,666
It's genuine alligator, for God's sake.
What's the matter with you?

779
01:09:31,771 --> 01:09:33,466
Sorry, Mr. Fairfax.

780
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:36,905
-Hello, Mr. Fairfax.
-How's it going, Charlie?

781
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:42,942
Well, between us
and our neighborhood cops,

782
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:45,540
I'd say we got him
pretty well covered, huh?

783
01:09:46,753 --> 01:09:48,220
Walter, wake up.

784
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,650
Walter!

785
01:09:52,258 --> 01:09:53,418
Wake up!

786
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:56,122
Keep those bags up, boys.

787
01:09:57,163 --> 01:10:00,621
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm the reason you're back early.

788
01:10:02,368 --> 01:10:03,892
-You're Porter?
-That's right.

789
01:10:04,003 --> 01:10:05,834
Keep those bags up above
shoulder level, boys.

790
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:07,668
You drop them and I'll drill you.

791
01:10:11,344 --> 01:10:14,472
Well, what'll you have me do,
stand on my head?

792
01:10:15,114 --> 01:10:18,550
No. I want you to do me a favor
and call Mrs. Bronson,

793
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:20,778
see what we can do about my money.

794
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:23,856
Well, she let Carter die.

795
01:10:24,324 --> 01:10:28,055
But that poor buck-toothed bastard
is probably better off dead anyway.

796
01:10:28,962 --> 01:10:30,896
She'd probably let me die, too.

797
01:10:30,997 --> 01:10:33,124
No, with Carter
she thought I was bluffing.

798
01:10:36,302 --> 01:10:37,496
Try her.

799
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:39,396
All right.

800
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,767
You two are fired.

801
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:48,837
Hello? Yes, it's like this.

802
01:10:49,415 --> 01:10:52,407
I'm standing in my living room
and there's a man here named Porter

803
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:55,886
who says that he expects you
to pay him sooner or later.

804
01:10:57,223 --> 01:10:58,656
Yes, of course.

805
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:02,718
-She wants to talk to you.
-Put her on the speaker.

806
01:11:09,068 --> 01:11:10,296
This is Porter.

807
01:11:10,403 --> 01:11:12,530
I should probably have you
just shoot Fairfax

808
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:15,199
and then hire you to run the city for me.

809
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:18,766
Too bad you're just a punk
with the right balls-to-brains ratio.

810
01:11:19,379 --> 01:11:23,042
Honey, I wouldn't even
get out of bed for 1 30 grand.

811
01:11:23,349 --> 01:11:25,840
You people aren't listening.
It's not 1 30 grand...

812
01:11:25,952 --> 01:11:29,444
No, you listen.
You got no place to go, Porter.

813
01:11:29,856 --> 01:11:32,791
You're finished.
Do you get what I'm talking about?

814
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:35,185
Fairfax?

815
01:11:35,328 --> 01:11:37,319
-Hey, what the hell are you doing, man?
-Fairfax?

816
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,864
-Are you okay?
-Yes. No, it's all right.

817
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:43,800
He's just killing my alligator bags
and shooting holes in my suit.

818
01:11:43,903 --> 01:11:47,031
-Man, that's just mean.
-Okay, Porter, I give up.

819
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,174
Where do you wanna
pick up your money?

820
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:51,541
King's Cross Station.

821
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:54,738
Send one man
with a blue backpack full of cash.

822
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:56,878
I'll be on the platform.

823
01:11:57,116 --> 01:12:00,711
-What's the name of the stop?
-It's the end of the line.

824
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:03,282
For you, too, sweetheart.

825
01:12:09,062 --> 01:12:11,553
You just signed your own death warrant
for $1 30,000.

826
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:16,328
I don't... I don't get that. What is it,
the principle or something, huh?

827
01:12:16,903 --> 01:12:19,428
No, I just want my money back.

828
01:12:25,612 --> 01:12:27,409
And it's only 70.

829
01:12:28,014 --> 01:12:30,778
70? What do you mean it's only 70?

830
01:12:31,217 --> 01:12:33,014
Only 70,000?

831
01:12:33,753 --> 01:12:35,812
Hell, my suits are worth more than that.

832
01:12:36,589 --> 01:12:39,524
Listen to this. "Ocean Ray Sundancer.

833
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:44,258
"Vacuum-flush head. 80,000 bucks."

834
01:12:46,299 --> 01:12:48,392
I'm telling you, you ain't gonna have it.

835
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:51,629
-You wanna bet?
-No, I don't wanna bet.

836
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:53,866
I'm out $150 already.

837
01:12:55,341 --> 01:12:59,505
$150 I'm getting my damn boat.
Better come down with something.

838
01:12:59,612 --> 01:13:00,977
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

839
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:03,477
Hicks, Leary,

840
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:06,848
we're Holland and Vanowen.
lnternal Affairs.

841
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:12,123
You boys wanna back off?
We're on a stakeout here.

842
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:15,194
-You wanna step out of the car, please?
-What for?

843
01:13:15,294 --> 01:13:17,728
I think you better
step out of the car, Detectives.

844
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:31,842
-What the hell's going on?
-I don't know.

845
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:35,978
Is this your badge, Detective?
The one you reported missing?

846
01:13:38,484 --> 01:13:41,544
-Yeah. Where'd you find it?
-Where exactly did you lose it?

847
01:13:45,324 --> 01:13:46,951
Does this belong to you?

848
01:13:52,665 --> 01:13:55,998
-It's Porter. Follow him.
-I got that motherfucker.

849
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:07,504
Hey.

850
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:14,719
Get in, Porter.

851
01:14:21,427 --> 01:14:22,689
Close the door.

852
01:14:24,163 --> 01:14:26,256
Now set the roscoe on the floor.

853
01:14:28,401 --> 01:14:29,493
Slow.

854
01:14:33,806 --> 01:14:37,674
See, I am gonna turn you in
to the outfit for a reward.

855
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:40,675
And maybe they'll be so impressed
that they'll ask me to join,

856
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,509
and I'll be on easy street.

857
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,783
Medical, dental.

858
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:48,647
I'm just... I'm gonna walk you right in.

859
01:14:48,888 --> 01:14:50,617
Porter on the hoof.

860
01:14:51,157 --> 01:14:53,091
Unless you get rambunctious.

861
01:14:53,192 --> 01:14:56,286
Then I'll just have
to take care of you myself...

862
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:01,398
You're not gonna fucking kill me,
are you?

863
01:15:08,474 --> 01:15:09,702
Let him go.

864
01:15:11,544 --> 01:15:12,636
Now.

865
01:15:18,284 --> 01:15:19,808
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

866
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:51,172
Hey. Hey. Hey, Porter!

867
01:16:51,677 --> 01:16:52,701
Hey!

868
01:16:53,846 --> 01:16:55,279
Hey, come on!

869
01:17:22,408 --> 01:17:25,343
Hey, handsome. This is a loading zone.

870
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:28,043
So move me.

871
01:17:29,282 --> 01:17:30,442
So move.

872
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:32,878
You Porter?

873
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,945
Over there by your buddy. U-turn.

874
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:59,805
We're taking a new position. Get in.

875
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,818
-Where to?
-Relax and you'll survive this.

876
01:18:11,424 --> 01:18:14,154
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Take the next left.

877
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:24,330
You know, I think I fucked you once.

878
01:18:25,471 --> 01:18:26,597
Oh, yeah?

879
01:18:30,543 --> 01:18:32,534
What do you think
the odds are on twice?

880
01:18:37,049 --> 01:18:40,485
-I'll meet you at the L in 10 minutes.
-I'll be there.

881
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,389
I don't think your odds are good.

882
01:18:52,431 --> 01:18:54,058
You got anything to say?

883
01:18:54,867 --> 01:18:56,357
No, thank you.

884
01:18:56,969 --> 01:18:58,402
Then just stay here.

885
01:19:24,563 --> 01:19:25,689
Don't move.

886
01:19:26,632 --> 01:19:28,657
You got any friends here
I should know about?

887
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,633
You should try the men's room.

888
01:20:27,226 --> 01:20:28,250
Hey.

889
01:20:30,362 --> 01:20:31,420
Porter?

890
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:41,629
Step back here. Come on.

891
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,053
The guy says you should drink this.

892
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:05,023
-What guy?
-Me.

893
01:21:05,164 --> 01:21:06,893
Take it in your right hand.

894
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:11,336
Sit down.

895
01:21:13,772 --> 01:21:15,171
Where's your piece?

896
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:17,505
-Lunchbox.
-Open it.

897
01:21:20,346 --> 01:21:21,438
Close it.

898
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:38,526
Get on the train.

899
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:34,643
What...

900
01:22:54,139 --> 01:22:55,299
Here it is.

901
01:23:02,014 --> 01:23:03,072
Open it.

902
01:23:04,016 --> 01:23:06,143
It's all there. 130 grand.

903
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:08,845
It's 70, you dumb bastards. Open it.

904
01:23:59,204 --> 01:24:00,501
Hey, Phil.

905
01:24:06,412 --> 01:24:08,676
Jesus, how'd he make it?

906
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,112
Come on! Move it!

907
01:24:50,956 --> 01:24:53,720
You think you can make
everything okay, don't you?

908
01:24:54,827 --> 01:24:56,795
How strong are you, Porter?

909
01:24:57,329 --> 01:25:00,025
You know, this may sound crazy,
Porter, but...

910
01:25:00,165 --> 01:25:01,826
You just don't get it, do you, you dumb...

911
01:25:02,768 --> 01:25:04,292
We'll hit them on Friday.

912
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:06,394
Someone ought to give me a PhD.

913
01:25:06,505 --> 01:25:08,803
What are you gonna do, kill me?

914
01:25:08,907 --> 01:25:11,432
Please. Allow me.

915
01:25:11,577 --> 01:25:14,740
What is it,
the principle or something, huh?

916
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:16,439
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

917
01:25:16,782 --> 01:25:18,750
Come on, baby,
we got to get you out of here.

918
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:21,513
Come with me.
Come on, baby, we gotta go.

919
01:25:21,987 --> 01:25:25,923
Come on. Porter? Come on! Come on!

920
01:25:26,358 --> 01:25:27,586
Porter?

921
01:25:27,993 --> 01:25:30,860
Fuck! God damn it!

922
01:25:32,364 --> 01:25:33,763
Porter?

923
01:25:36,402 --> 01:25:37,892
Oh, Rosie.

924
01:25:41,106 --> 01:25:44,633
Rosie. Rosie.

925
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,739
-Come on.
-Rosie.

926
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:51,239
-Help me out.
-You're okay. Okay.

927
01:26:02,561 --> 01:26:04,893
-Backpack. Backpack.
-I got it, I got it.

928
01:26:09,201 --> 01:26:12,329
-I got to get you to a hospital.
-No hospitals.

929
01:26:12,805 --> 01:26:14,033
I know a guy.

930
01:26:15,574 --> 01:26:17,303
-ls he a doctor?
-No.

931
01:26:19,411 --> 01:26:20,400
No.

932
01:26:21,213 --> 01:26:25,274
-Tell me where to go.
-Just drive, baby.
