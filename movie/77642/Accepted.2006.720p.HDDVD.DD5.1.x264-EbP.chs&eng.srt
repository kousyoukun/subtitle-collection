00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,400
我整整一年不用去上体育课
I didn't have to go to gym class for a whole year

136
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,900
因为我称自己对出汗过敏
'cause I claimed to be allergic to sweat.

137
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,560
还有一次 我成功的从医生那里开到证明说我有夜行症
Or what about the time I got the note from my doctor saying I was nocturnal

138
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,230
于是被允许可以边做梦边学习
and I was allowed to study in my dreams?

139
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,900
我让学校的一霸，弗兰克·达利 被学校开除了两年
I got the school bully, Frank Daley, kicked out for two years

140
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,810
因为我说他性侵犯我
because he was sexually harassing me

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,310
把我按在柜子上，然后我说我感到异常
by pushing me up against the locker and I said I felt something.

142
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,210
你瞧见了，这是天才的表现
I mean, come on. That was pure genius.

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,580
也许你不该写那篇叫做“我一无所知”的论文
Maybe if you didn't write an essay called "l Don't Have a Clue."

144
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,850
可那是事实！
Well, it's true. You know?

145
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,890
关于我的余生将怎样度过，我一无所知
I don't have a clue what I want to do with the rest of my life.

146
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,620
老爸老妈会杀了你的
Mom and Dad are gonna kill you.

147
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,130
相信我好了
O ye of little faith.

148
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,420
- 他们不会的 - 是吗？
They're not gonna kill me. Uh-huh.

149
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,690
我只要稍微耍点小花招
I just have to spin it

150
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,750
用一种他们可以理解的方式解释
and put it in terms they can understand.

151
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,160
我不能理解
I don't understand.

152
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,030
我也不能理解
I don't understand, either.

153
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,890
好吧，这么说吧
Okay, I figure it like this.

154
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,600
大学每年的学费是多少？ 20000美元？
The average cost of college is, what, $20,000 a year?

155
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,570
根据我从网上查到的统计
Now, according to these estimates that I got off the Web...

156
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,010
大家传阅一下
You can pass those around.

157
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,570
一个只有高中学历的人
Someone with no education beyond high school

158
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,640
在目前的就业情况下，一年可以挣20000美元
can expect to make about $20,000 a year in the current job market.

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,770
也就是说，接下来的四年
Now, that being said, over the next four years,

160
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,880
你们可以选择花费80000美元
you could either spend $80,000

161
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,420
或者，我可以挣80000美元
or I could make $80,000.

162
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,480
(CHUCKLES)

163
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,820
你难道不想上大学？
Are you saying you don't want to go to college?

164
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,260
不，我只是说，如果我去上大学
No. I'm saying that it is fiscally irresponsible

165
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,420
这从财政上来说不科学
for me to go to college. You know?

166
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,720
- 你是不是吸毒了？ - 哦，老天，没有
Are you huffing? Oh, God. No.

167
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,700
- 你发烧了？ - 你吸大麻？
Are you high? You're huffing grass?

168
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,260
不，我没有吸毒，也没有喝酒，我完全正常
No. I'm not huffing, Mom. I'm not stoned. I'm completely fine.

169
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,930
事实上，我现在再清醒不过了
In fact, I'm more clear and level-headed than I've ever been.

170
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,100
那好，收起你那套吧，巴特比.
Okay, cut the crap, Bartleby.

171
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,570
这个社会有它的准则
Society has rules.

172
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,640
第一条准则就是：上大学 恩
And the first rule is you go to college. Mmm-hmm.

173
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,340
你想拥有快乐而成功的人生吗？ 那就上大学
You want to have a happy and successful life? You go to college.

174
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,410
你想出人头地？ 那就上大学
If you want to be somebody, you go to college.

175
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,650
如果你想融入社会 就去上大学！
If you want to fit in, you go to college.

176
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,250
如果没有大学要我怎么办
Well, you know what? Maybe I didn't get into college.

177
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,290
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

178
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,100
所有的学校都拒收我
I didn't get accepted anywhere.

179
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,200
噢， 巴特比.
Oh, Bartleby.

180
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,260
该死
Damn it.

181
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,870
我就说了，他应该从初中开始准备上大学
I knew he should've started preparing for college in junior high

182
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,240
就像他妹妹
Iike his sister.

183
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,440
现在她做的很好 我做的很好
Now, she's got a shot. I've got a shot.

184
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,780
- 她做的很好 - 大家听着
She's got a shot. Listen, guys.

185
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,010
有很多成功人士没有上过大学
There are plenty of successful people who didn't go to college.

186
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,880
阿尔伯特.爱因斯坦，你们都知道
Albert Einstein, you know.

187
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,010
波卡洪塔斯从没有上过大学 （《风中奇缘》中的印地安公主）
Pocahontas never went to college.

188
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,890
克里·费尔德曼，还有 科里·海姆 （两人均为演员）
Corey Feldman and Corey Haim.

189
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,080
他们都事业有成
They had a great run.

190
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,720
还有刘易斯（《纳尼亚传奇》的作者） 和克拉克（鞋业大亨）
Both Lewis and Clark.

191
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,660
苏珊娜·萨默斯（电影演员） 波诺（U2乐队主唱）
Suzanne Somers. Bono.

192
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,960
我得去看看皮鞋匠那里是不是收学徒
I need to go check on the cobbler.

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,900
"皮鞋匠" 咕，咕，咕
"Check the cobbler." Glug, glug, glug.

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,640
我毫不关心波诺做了什么或者没做什么
You know, I really don't care what Sonny Bono did or didn't do.

195
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,570
你得上大学
You're goin' to college.

196
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,450
我告诉过你了
I told you so.

197
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,810
知道了
You were adopted.

(DON'T STOP PLAYlNG)

各位
MRS. SCHRADER: Everyone,

200
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,040
我想敬所有的毕业生一杯
I would like to propose a toast to our graduates.

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,780
2006年毕业的同学们
To the Class of 2006,

202
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,050
祝未来的大学四年
may the next four years of college

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,830
嘿，伙计，怎么样
HANDS: Hey. Hey, man, what's up?

207
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,200
- 好啊， B? - 你好，伙计
What's up, B? How you doin'? What's up?

208
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,160
伙计，我发誓，如果再有一个人说
Dude, I swear, if one more person tells me

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,500
要上大学了，真兴奋这样的话 我就崩溃了
how excited they are to go to college, I'm gonna lose it.

210
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,970
伙计，我听说奖学金的事情了
Oh, man, I heard about the scholarship.

211
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,530
太变态了，你是我们州最棒的接球手
That's insane. You're one of the best receivers in the state.

212
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,240
曾经的吧，膝盖受伤就别想打棒球了
Uh, the best. And, uh, no knee, no football, man.

213
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,280
太过分了，接下来打算怎么办？
That sucks. What are you gonna do now?

214
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,540
我也不知道
I have no idea.

215
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,540
真是患难兄弟啊
That makes two of us, pal.

- 没什么大不了的，没什么大不了的 .
RORY: It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

217

- 嗨，罗莉，怎么了？ - 嗨，什么？哦，没事，没什么大不了的
Hey, Rory. What's goin' on? Oh, hey. What? Fine. Nothing.

218
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,990
呃，我没有被耶鲁大学录取
Um, l--I didn't get into Yale.

219
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,920
我没有...没有被耶鲁录取
I did-- I didn't, I didn't get into Yale.

220

我没有... 没有被耶鲁录取
I didn't... I didn't get into Yale.

221
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,490
什么？难以置信
What? I can't believe that!

222
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,900
耶鲁大学没有容纳罗莉的地方
Well, there's no room for Rory at Yale.

223
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,760
成绩平平，家里有钱的孩子太多了
Too many rich kids with mediocre grades

224
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,000
而且，我猜今年有关系的家长也很多
and well-connected parents this year, I guess.

225
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,630
没有罗莉的容身之所 她从一年级就开始
No room for Rory, who's been working

226
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,300
为进耶鲁大学努力学习
since first grade to get into Yale.

227
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,540
罗莉， 她除了耶鲁没有申请第二所学校
Rory, who only applied to Yale and nowhere else.

你吃蛋糕了吗？
Did you have any cake?

240
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,390
哦，你知道我不喜欢吃蛋糕
No, you know, I'm not much of a cake guy.

241
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,530
这蛋糕做的棒极了
Oh, it is a hell of a cake.

242
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,570
这蛋糕的口味从斯科特和塞斯 读哈蒙学院的时候就没变过
It is the same cake we got for Scotty and Seth when they got into Harmon.

What about you, Bartleby?

问的好，哈金先生
That's a good question, Mr. Harkin.

Bartleby screwed around and now he's not goin' to college.

BARTLEBY: Yeah. B, you realize that makes it S.H.I.T., right?

264
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,250
狗屁？ 我随便想的，管他呢
S.H.I.T.? I was wingin' it. Whatever.

265
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,010
帮我建好网站就行了
Just finish building the website, please.

266
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,780
这也太疯狂了吧？
This is the act of a desperate, wildly unrealistic person.

267
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,580
B，你弄好了也发给我一份录取通知书
Yo, B, you have to hook me up with one of these acceptance letters, bro.

268
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,720
- 你是不是在搞笑，当然不行 - 为什么？
Are you kidding me? No way. Why not?

269
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,520
得了，要想奏效，就必须得保密
Oh, come on. The only way this is gonna work is if we keep it quiet.

270
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,090
即使这样，还是得从长计议
And even then, it's still a long shot.

271
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,290
伙计，我不管了，我总得做点什么
Dude, I don't care. I have to do somethin'.

272
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,420
我一丢了奖学金
The minute I lost my scholarship,

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,130
我老爸就开始考虑让我去开公交车了
my pop started talkin' about me getting my own bus route.

274
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,640
帮帮我
Help me. Please? Mmm.

275
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,660
你知道吗？
You know something?

276
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,370
为了大众的安全，我也不能让你去开公交车
For the safety of the public, I can't let you drive a bus.

277
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
太好了 但是记住
Sweet. But listen to me.

278
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,510
这只是权宜之计
This is just a temporary stopgap measure, okay?

279
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,100
- 明白吗？ - 明白
Nothing more. Gotcha.

280
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,650
太棒了，伙计们 你们俩
Bravo, guys. Great. Both of you guys.

281
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,780
我们可以先伪造一个学校 然后就可以开个毒品加工厂了
Let's start this fake college. And then we'll go start a meth lab somewhere.

282
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,790
- 这就是犯罪的开始 - 什么？
BARTLEBY: Come on. It's a gateway crime. What?

283
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,880
犯罪就是这样开始的
That's how these things start.

284
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,290
你知道吗， 施瑞德
You know something, Schrader,

285
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,830
你可以上一所好大学
you got into a great college.

286
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,260
前程似锦
And your future's lookin' really good,

287
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,060
我很为你感到骄傲，因为你是我最好的朋友
and I'm psyched for you, pal, 'cause you're my best friend and I love you.

288
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,760
我只是想让你帮我一个小忙
I'm talking about me coming to you, asking for your help.

289
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,700
做好这个网页
Just finish the damn website.

290
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,360
求你了
Please.

291
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,330
怎么样？
What do you say?

292
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,100
这就对了 好吧
There he is! Fine.

293
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,910
离我远点，你这个白痴
(HANDS CLAPPlNG) Get off me, you idiot.

294
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,240
但我们需要一些诸如教学目标什么的
But we need some sort of, like, mission statement or something.

295
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,910
你老爸肯定要看，我了解他，他很难缠
Your dad's gonna want to see that. I know him, he's a hard-ass.

296
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,980
嘿，孩子们，亲爱的！
Hey, kids. Honey!

297
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,950
嗨，你好吗
Hey. Hi. How are you? Hey.

298
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,080
这是什么？
JACK: What's this?

299
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,590
南哈蒙理工学院？ 这是什么？
South Harmon lnstitute of Technology? What's that?

300
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,290
嗯？看看
Mmm? What's that?

301
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,230
这是本地区最受尊敬的大学之一
One of the most respected schools in the area, that's what that is.

302
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,390
上面说什么？
Well, what's it say?

303
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,860
我得先打开看看
I gotta open it first.

304
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,300
快点哦
DlANE: Come on, hurry.

305
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,400
哦，我很紧张
Oh. I'm nervous.

306
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,430
"亲爱的巴特比，
"Dear Bartleby,

307
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,310
“祝贺你，你被录取了！”
"congratulations, you've been accepted!"

308
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,610
我被录取了!
I got in!

309
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,150
- 啊！感谢上帝 - 我被录取了
Aw, thank God. Thank God. (LAUGHlNG) I got in!

310
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,580
哦！老天
Hey-o! Oh! God!

311
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,810
- 亲爱的 - 我没事
Honey. I'm okay.

312
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,220
太棒了
Hey, this is great!

313
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,310
太令人激动了
It's so exciting!

314
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,150
南哈蒙理工学院是什么大学?
What the hell is South Harmon lnstitute of Technology? Yeah.

315
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,630
是哈蒙学院的姊妹学校之一
Oh, it's one of Harmon College's sister schools.

316
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,590
我从没听说过
I've never heard of it.

317
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,790
因为姊妹中最小的一个
Well, because it's the baby sister.

318
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,730
也是最严谨，保守的一所
It's the most discreet and unharmed of the sister schools.

319
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,360
你有关于这所学校的资料吗？
You got any literature on this place?

320
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,800
它有自己的网站，我给你看网址
Yeah, there's a website, I'll show you the link.

321
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,500
你成功了 你是个大学生了
You did it. You're a college boy.

322
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,870
哇
Wow.

323
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,340
你们想吃点么？

嗨，我恨我的生活
Hey! I hate my life.

326
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,080
我是个大除草机
I'm a huge tool.

Hey, Dad, what's up?

330
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,990
我看了网站
I took a look at that website.

331
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,260
哦
Oh.

332
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,520
酷
Cool.

333
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,660
看上去不像真的
It looks unreal.

334
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,170
假的？
Unreal?

335
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,670
是啊，难以置信
Yeah, it looks pretty unbelievable, huh?

336
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,740
看上去像是个很棒的大学
It seems like a solid place.

337
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,800
真的
Really?

338
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,170
给你
Here you go.

339
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,610
第一学期的学费一次付清
First semester's tuition. Paid in full.

340
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,280
太棒了
That's great.

341
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,250
哇，谢谢你老爸
Wow, thank you, Dad.

342
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,120
哦，对不起

谢谢，老爸
Thanks, Dad.

你妈和我等不及要把你送出去读书了
Your mother and l can't wait to drop you off.

345
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,100
我们需要做的是在哈蒙学院附近租一个地方
What we need to do is lease a place near Harmon

346
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,600
这样才能骗父母相信
so we can fool our parents. Yeah.

347
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,830
施瑞德，你知道哈蒙学院附近有什么地方可以租的么？
Hey, Schrad, do you know any places up near Harmon we can rent?

348
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,100
是的，我知道
Oh, yeah, I do, actually.

349
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,800
我总是随身携带废弃房屋清单
I carry around a list with me at all times

350
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,710
专门用于伪造大学用
of abandoned buildings for fake colleges.

351
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,670
伙计，我已经给你们开了一个银行户头
Dude, I started you guys a bank account already.

352
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,900
你还想怎么样？让我当你的房地产经纪人？
What do you want me to be, your realtor?

353
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,710
嗨，伙计们，好啊
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

354
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,810
好啊， 格伦?

when did you start working at the Kwik 'N Stop?

357
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,320
从我被所有的大学拒收时开始
Since I got boned, hard, by every college I applied to.

358
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,550
怎么了？
Why, what happened?

359
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,280
因为政治原因
Some political crap.

360
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,620
我SAT（Scholastic Assessment Test：美国高考） 考试得零分.
I got a zero on my SATs.

361
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,760
你只要在考卷上签个名
You know you get 600 points

362
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,350
就能得到600分，不是吗？
just for signing your name, right?

(SNlCKERS)

364
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,760
好了，谈正事
All right, let's get serious, man.

365
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,270
怎么去找一个看上去像大学的地方
Now, where we gonna find a place to pass off as a college?

366
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,400
嗨，伙计们，我知道一个地方
Hey, guys! I know a place.

367
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,070
你怎么知道这个地方的？
HANDS: How'd you know about this place?

368
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,710
我曾经在这里当过志愿者
RORY: I used to do volunteer work here.

369
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,840
这地方太棒了

一鸟在手（谚语：比喻既得利益）
BARTLEBY: A bird in the hand, dude. A bird in the hand.

372
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,640
这是什么意思
SCHRADER: That doesn't make any sense.

373
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,120
这是一种说法
BARTLEBY: It's a saying. SCHRADER: What?

374
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,820
是未雕琢的钻石
A diamond in the rough.

但愿你们都有意外伤害保险

嘿，伙计们，别进去
Hey! Hey, guys, don't go in there.

381
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,700
这属于擅自闯入
This is breaking and entering.

施瑞德，别怕
Schrader, come on. Don't be scared.

383

谁怕了？ 我才不怕，是你怕了
Who's scared? I'm not scared. You're scared.

384
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,950
施瑞德 你不想尝尝Dr.Pepper（软饮料）的新口味？
Schrader, you were scared to try the new flavor of Dr Pepper.

385

这是我们俩的秘密，汉兹
I told you that in confidence, Hands.

386
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,350
施瑞德， 你换牙的时候也害怕
Schrader, you were afraid when your tooth fell out,

387
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,950
因为你害怕那个同性恋牙医
because you were terrified of the tooth fairy.

388
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,390
这种害怕很正常
That's actually a legitimate fear.

BARTLEBY: We don't have to renovate the whole place.

Yeah, well, technically, he was fired.

所以我退出了
So I quit.

534
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,430
我发辞呈了
I did send in my resignation

535
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,400
以一种非正常的方式
in a rather unorthodox fashion.

536
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,460
没错，你给院长寄了一包狗屎
You sent the dean of the university a bag of dog shit.

537
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,440
- 这是一种比喻 - 表示什么？
It was a metaphor. For what?

538
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,030
表示：“你就是一陀狗屎！” 哦
For "You're full of shit!" Oh.

539
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,840
- 这不是比喻 - 这就是比喻
That's not a metaphor. That's a metaphor.

540
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,400
或者暗喻，隐喻
Oh, semantics, schmantics.

541
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,420
三年以前我就厌倦了这一套东西
Three years from now, I'm finished with this crap.

542
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,510
我要去巴布亚新几内亚 我不干了
I'm goin' to Papua New Guinea. I'm outta here.

543
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,210
你要去哪里？
Wh-Where-- Where you going?

544
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,690
反正不干了
I'm going off the grid.

545
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,380
去他妈的公民权 去他妈的镇痛期
No more, uh, franchises, no more Botox,

546
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,520
去他妈的“嘿，我们再克隆一只羊”
no more "Eh, oh, let's clone another goat."

547
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
也去他妈的什么反性侵犯条例
And certainly no more sexual harassment suits.

548
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,770
说：“嗨，你的乳头很漂亮”有什么问题？
What's wrong with saying, "Hey! Nice tits."

549
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,230
什么时候说才算正常？
When did that go out the window?

550
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
好了，本，我只是想请你
Okay, Ben, all I'm asking you

551
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,370
随便和家长握握手什么的
is just shake a couple hands with some parents,

552
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,570
然后说：“你好，我是院长”之类的
say, "Hi, I'm the dean," whatever.

553
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,800
如果我们付钱给你怎么样？
What if we pay you?

554
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,540
别用你的金钱来玷污我的名誉
Don't sully my dignity with your cash.

555
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,140
你在这儿！你又让一个孩子哭了？
There you are! Did you make another child cry?

556
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,080
不是我的错，这孩子天生爱哭。你这个小杂种！
It's not my fault the kid's a crybaby! Little dipshit.

557
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,050
- 你是个混蛋！ - 你才是个混蛋！
You're an asshole! You're an asshole.

558
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,210
你的确是个混蛋，你被开除了！
You are an asshole. And you're fired.

559
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,720
也许我们可以继续谈谈刚才的事
Perhaps it is time to move on.

560
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,320
不过我得带上我的房子
But I get to bring my house.

561
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,520
成交
Deal.

562
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,330
- 右还是左？ - 右！
Right or left? Right.

563
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,130
- 哪个右边？ - 你说了算
Whose right? Your call.

564
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,500
- 你这个白痴 - 你弄反了
You're an idiot! You're upset.

565
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,830
跟着你的感觉走吧
Go with what you feel.

566
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,460
大概还有12英尺
You got about 12 feet.

好了，大家笑一下
RORY: Okay, smiles, everyone.

571
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,700
大学第一天
First day at college.

572
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,440
颜色怎么这样？ 屎黄色？
What's up with these colors? Shit brown? Really?

573
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,350
- 格伦选的 - 我就知道
Glen picked 'em. Of course he did.

574
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,720
你哪里找来的这些人？
Where'd you find all these people?

575
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,690
呃，我志愿参加了一个“大家学英语”的活动
Uh, I volunteer at an English-as-a-second-language program.

576
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,020
这些是我的学生，我告诉他们 如果想及格
These are my students. I told them if they wanted to pass,

577
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,150
他们必须成功的融入
they'd have to successfully assimilate

578
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,660
美国大学校园的氛围
into the American college environment.

579
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,920
哦！家长来了！
Whoa! The parents are here!

580
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,460
好了，伙计们，该我们了！
Okay! We're on, guys!

581
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,470
看我们的表演！
Okay, people, it's showtime!

582
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,460
哇
DlANE: Wow.

583
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,470
- 看我没骗你吧 - 哦，完全没有
BARTLEBY: No frills around here. DlANE: Oh, none at all.

584
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,740
看那个常春藤，雕像还有红墙， 实打实的学校
None of that, uh, that ivy, or gargoyles, or mahogany, it's the real deal.

585
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,740
实打实吧？
The real deal, huh?

586
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,900
没错，孩子，完全没错
This is it, kid. This is it.

587
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,810
这是你人生的重要时刻，把行李拿进去吧
The big moment. Take this in. Ah.

588
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,350
真令人激动，我兴奋死了
It's exciting, it's scary.

589
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,720
很令人激动 快看，太棒了
It's really scary. Oh, look! Oh, it looks great.

590
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,110
是的
Okay.

591
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,780
这里在干什么？
LlZZlE: What's going on here?

592
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,350
我们好像少了一个参观者
Okay, we lost one of the campers.

593
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,650
一个好奇的参观者
Curious campers.

594
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,560
你在干什么？ 不许这么做！
What are you doing? Don't do that. Don't do that.

那是怎么回事？
What the devil is that? Oh.

599
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,770
学校的供电系统的电泳
That's just a surge of collegiate energy.

600
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,100
大学都这样
It's college for you.

601
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,000
左边是我的宿舍，老爸
Take a left up here for the dorm room, Dad.

602
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,630
哦，你们大家能等一下吗
Oh, uh, can you hang on a second?

603
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,240
我现在必须要用一下洗手间
I just really gotta go to the bathroom a minute, you know.

604
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,840
哦，天哪，我只是……
Oh, Jesus Christ. I just wanna...

呃，这是，这是男厕所
Uh, it's, that's, it's the men's room.

607
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,580
你不能进去
You can't go in there.

608
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,980
你就不能在外面等我……
Well, can't you just stand outside...

609
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,850
黛安，你就不能等我们到餐厅吗？
Diane, can't you wait till we get to the restaurant?

610
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,260

BARTLEBY: Hey, I'll see you, Rasheed. I'll see you in math class.

611
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,620
你还欠我30块钱，别忘了
You owe me 30 bucks, by the way.

612

他真爱开玩笑
You jokester.

Here we are. You remember Hands. Hey, Mrs. Gaines.

- 你看上去气色不错 - 谢谢
You look great. Well, thank you.

616
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,760
我第一次看到的时候，我都不相信自己要住在这里
When I first saw it, I was like, I gotta live here?

617
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,100
难以置信，但这却是就是宿舍
I can't believe this. But it's a dorm room.

618
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,100
- 基恩斯先生 - 达利尔，过的怎么样？
Mr. Gaines. Daryl, how are you, partner?

619

- 哇，好大的握力
Oh, thunder grip.

620

为什么窗户外有铁栏杆？
Why are there bars on the window?

621
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,410
噢，为了防止有人不小心掉出窗外
Oh, that's so nobody accidentally gets thrown out.

622
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,240
很好，这里的学习环境很好
It's fine. It's a good learning environment.

623

没有太多不必要的东西，可以安心学习
Not a lot of extras. You'll study harder.

624
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,290
没错，你看都是蓝色的，还有墙
Yes. We will, because of the blue and the sparse walls.

我同意你的观点
I agree with you, sir.

这些是什么？
What are these?

627

这是为了以防万一有地震

拓展视野，形成世界观的时期
expand the way that they look at their world,

637
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,040
是他们尝试新事物和新思想的时期
when they open their minds to new ideas and experiences

638
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,610
并且是他们漫长旅程的开始
and when they begin that long journey

南哈蒙的办学理念？
a little bit about the philosophy here at South Harmon?

好吧，我们向这些孩子抛出一大堆诱人的字眼
Look, we throw a lot of fancy words in front of these kids,

649
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,980
吸引他们来上学
in order to attract them to going to school,

650
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,210
并自以为他们可以因此而获得美好前程
in the belief that they're gonna have a better life.

651
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,510
我们都知道自己所做的
And we all know that all we're doing

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,480
是培养下一代的

我们现在干什么？
So what do we do now?

684
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,850
我的朋友，我们现在念大学了

真有你的，B
Gotta hand it to you, B.

687
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,850
其他伙计们在教室里受煎熬
Kids everywhere are busting their ass in the classroom,

688
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,220
而我们却在这里杀外星人
and we're killing aliens, dude.

但你可以叫我A.D.D.
But you could call me A.D.D.,

701
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,620
其实我的确有A.D.D.
on account of the fact that I have A.D.D.,

702
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,280
也就是“注意力涣散失调症”
which is Attention Deficit Disorder and you know,

703
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,150
我六岁的时候，大家以为这只是因为我太爱吃糖了
everyone used to think it was just an addiction to sugar when I was six,

704
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,820
我老妈经常哭，因为她认为我不可能

Okay, okay, wh-wh-what are you doing here, then?

712
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,310
除非我看错网站了
Well, unless I misread the website,

我是来报道的！

你是在找哈蒙学院

就在那个坡下面

祝你好运，过得愉快
But good luck, have fun. Go, Harmon.

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,320
不，我是在找南哈蒙理工学院
No! I'm looking for South Harmon lnstitute of Technology

719
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,620
因为只有这所学校收我
because, well, it's the only place I got accepted

720

我是来念我的英语语言学位的
and I'm looking to pursue my degree in English

721

求你了

Oh, uh, sorry, sorry. No parents allowed past this point.

735
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,690
这是咱们学校的规矩
It's part of our philosophy here at South Harmon.

736
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,090
我们要让你们的孩子独立
We need to mold your kids into individuals,

737
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,250
第一步就是
and the first step is to

738
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,420
切断家长- 孩子这层关系

You're gonna fit right in, Larry. Unfortunately.

746
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,400
我们怎么办？
What are we gonna do?

747
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,810
这本来应该是个秘密
This is supposed to be a secret.

748

是啊，我看已经被揭穿了

00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,700
- 真的？ - 你喜欢所有的课程？
Really? Yeah. Do you like all your classes?

1066
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,800
当然，我选了一大堆
Yeah. I mean, well, I'm taking a bunch of classes

1067
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,270
不喜欢的课
that I don't really care about.

1068
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,330
眼下就有一个 虽然我死也不愿意选
There was this one, though, that I was dying to take.

1069
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,710
但我还死不了 你看，还算好
But, um, I ended up not being able to. But, you know, it's okay.

1070
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,210
下面要上什么课？
What was that one that you wanted to take?

1071
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,740
- 摄影 - 真的？很棒啊
Uh, ph-photography. It's... Really? That's cool.

1072
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,680
对 问题在哪？
Yeah. What was the problem?

1073
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,380
你看，先是摄影新闻课
Well, see, there's this, um, photojournalism class,

1074
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,250
但他们说只针对新闻专业
but they said it's only for journalism majors.

1075
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,990
后来是艺术摄影课
And then there's this art photography class,

1076
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,650
他们只针对艺术专业
but they said it's for fine arts majors.

1077
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:27,060
我的指导老师说最好都不报
So my advisor said it would be best not to take either one, or something,

1078
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,030
因为有些摄影课
because certain photography classes

1079
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,430
最后不提供学位
don't apply to a degree in photography.

1080
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,770
噢，太没意思了
Wow, that makes, that makes no sense at all.

1081
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,240
是啊，真对不起
I know. Um, but I'm really sorry.

1082
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,800
我得走了 我的古罗马历史课要迟到了
I gotta go, I'm gonna be late for my Ancient Roman History class.

1083
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,670
- 很高兴见到你，再见 - 好的，再见
It was good seeing you. Bye. Okay. Bye.

1084

1085
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,610
那就是所谓的大学？
BARTLEBY: I'm-- I'm just saying, I mean, is that what college is?

1086
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,320
你原以为怎样？ 人类精神的复兴？
What were you expecting? A renaissance of the human spirit?

1087
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,690
美国教育就是狗屎
American education is in the shitter.

1088
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,920
知道为什么？
You know why?

1089
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,090
因为人们忽略了最重要的规则
Because people forget the most important rule.

1090
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,990
大学是服务行业
College is a service industry.

1091
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,390
服务行业？
A service industry?

1092
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,200
为大众服务 其他的方式都不对
As in "serve us," as opposed to the other way around.

1093

看那边的孩子们

他们花钱来这
They all paid to come here.

1095
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,770
对 他们是为一种经历而花钱
Right. They all paid for an experience.

1096
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,310
什么经历？
What kind of experience?

1097
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,870
这就不知道了 我可不会读心术
The hell if I know. I'm not a goddamn mind reader.

1098
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,250
或许我可以问他们
Well, maybe I should just ask them.

为什么问我？
Why are you asking me?

1102
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,750
格伦，我问你是因为我预感到
Well, I'm asking you, Glen, because I have a hunch

1103
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,660
以前没人问过你
that no one's ever really asked you that before. Yeah?

It's opening yourself up to this great big ball of shit that we call life!

看你是否可信任
whether or not I can trust you.

1649

Thank you for that nice introduction, young man, but the joke is over.

1731
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:36,910
女士们，先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1732
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,250
南哈蒙理工学院
South Harmon lnstitute of Technology

1733
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,850
不是我们的姐妹学校
is not the sister school of Harmon

1734
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,650
或者什么也不是 在这件事情上
or of anything else, for that matter.

1735
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,490
更像是堂兄妹，谢谢你的到来
More like cousins. Thank you for coming.

1736
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,960
这可不行 任何...
It is not accredited. Any...

1737
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:51,070
她也不是一个正式的教育机构
Nor is it truly an educational institution.

1738
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,900
真的吗，巴特比？
Is this true, Bartleby?

1739
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,660
都是假的，骗局
It is a sham, a fraud,

1740
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,640
这会破坏其它大学的努力成果
that undermines the efforts of real colleges everywhere,

1741
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:05,750
我请你和认证机构的人证实一下
and I invite you to confirm that
with the State Board of Accreditation.

1742
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,080
上当的同学们
To all those students who have been duped,

1743
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,480
明年申请的时候好运吧
good luck applying to schools next year.

1744
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:14,790
基恩斯先生 我们的律师会联系你
And to Mr. Gaines I say you will be hearing from our attorneys.

1745
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,390
家长日，和我预料的一样
Wow, Parents' Day. Man, I wish I would have thought of that.

1746
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:24,220
我做到了
Oh, that's right, I did.

1747
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,830
顺便说下
Oh, and by the way,

1748
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,560
如果你遇到这里的产权所有者
if you, uh, if you see that lease holder of yours,

1749
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,230
能跟他说 当他发现这些骗局
will you tell him that his lease automatically breaks

1750
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,270
会自动中止协议？
when he's found guilty of fraud?

1751
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,640
很好，谢谢，D
Cool. Thanks, D.

1752
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:34,200
G?
Er, was it G?

1753
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,510
对了，是F 再见F
That's right, it's F. See you, F.

1754
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,110
听我解释
Guys, I can explain. Mmm-mmm.

1755
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:44,680
你做了些蠢事，巴特比
You have done some stupid things in your life, Bartleby,

1756
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,490
但这...
but this...

1757
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,820
收拾好东西 回汽车上吧
You get your stuff together. You meet us in the car.

1758
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,720
难以置信
This is unconscionable.

1759
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,490
真可笑
STUDENT: Ridiculous.

1760
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,990
嘿
Hey.

1761
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,600
如此...
So,

1762
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:05,970
都是假的？
none of this was real?

1763
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,340
不是真的
That's not true.

1764
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,280
等等，莫妮卡
Wait, Monica. Monica, wait.

1765
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:12,880
莫妮卡
Monica.

1766
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,020
对不起
Sorry, man.

1767
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:19,880
还好 我们努力了
It's cool. We tried.

一点想法都没有？
Have you completely lost your mind?

1807
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,070
各位，他们把大学定义为很多人
Guys, the state defines a college as a body of people

1808
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,510
怀有共同愿望的高等教育
with a shared common purpose of a higher education.

1809
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:21,700
那就是说我们也是 对不对？
Well that's us, isn't it?

1810
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,140
我的意思是，你们知道 “高等”这个词是个宽松的定义
I mean, you know, with the word "higher" kind of loosely defined.

1811
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,980
对，他完全六神无主
Uh, yeah. He's completely lost his mind.

1812
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:28,740
不不，听着 我们要做的
No, no. Listen, all we have to do

1813
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,450
就是在认证机构之前
is go before the state accrediting board,

1814
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,720
向官员递交我们的案子
with a licensed administrator, and just present our case.

1815
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,280
B，让我们减少损失吧？
B, look, let's just cut our losses, okay?

1816
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,420
我们在这谈什么？
What are we talking about here, huh?

1817
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,820
再谈一张无用的纸
We're talking about a stupid piece of paper.

1818
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,190
我的意思是 如果只需要一张纸
I mean, if a stupid piece of paper

1819
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:42,160
就可以让我们被接受
is what's gonna make us acceptable,

1820
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,030
我们就试一试 为什么不？
then let's go for it. Why not?

1821
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,570
你们记住，这不只关系我们？
'Cause you gotta remember, it's not just about us anymore, okay?

1822
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,700
关系到南哈蒙的每个人
It's about everyone who went to South Harmon.

(CLAPPlNG)

1824

Ah, great speech.

1825
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,430
我获得了灵感 我被它感染了
I was inspired, I felt inspired by it.

1826
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,540
谢谢 我在做个巡回
Thanks a lot, I'm-- I'm taking it on tour.

1827
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:57,700
你在做什么？
What are you doing here?

1828
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,440
不知道 我得去拿些东西
Aw, I don't know. I had-- I had to pick up some stuff.

1829
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,820
香紫苏油，茄子 橄榄油，玉米棒
Some sage. Eggplant. Olive oil. Some Funyuns.

1830
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:06,380
等等
Wait a minute.

1831
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,750
来吧
Come on!

1832
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,050
你不是要去申请鉴定吗？ 是不是？
You're the one that applied for accreditation, aren't you?

1833
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,390
有些人必须要站出来，明白？
Well, someone had to do it, you know?

1834
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,490
我们不能低头活着
We all can't live with our heads up our asses.

1835
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,730
- 不同意 - 我不太明白
I disagree. I--I don't get it, man.

1836
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,360
你说过你不想参与
You said you didn't wanna be a part of this thing.

1837
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,300
我本不想参与其中任何事情
I didn't want to have anything to do with it.

1838
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:23,570
我原本想成为施瑞德家第四代 去哈蒙的人
I wanted to be the fourth generation of Schrader to go to Harmon.

1839
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,730
但我后来意识到
But then I realized,

1840
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:27,330
我更想成为家中
I would much rather be the first generation of Schrader

1841
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:30,000
第一个去南哈蒙的人
to go to the South Harmon lnstitute of Technology.

1842
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,480
说完了，行了吧？
I said it, okay? I said it.

1843
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:33,110
所以你说
So you're saying,

1844
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,910
你想成为南哈蒙的头？
you're saying you want to be a S.H.I.T. head?

1845
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,720
我说我想成为南哈蒙的头
I'm sayin' I want to be a S.H.I.T. head.

1846
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:38,810
我想成为南哈蒙的头
I wanna be a S.H.I.T. head.

1847
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,910
太好了，欢迎你回来
Yeah, man, well, it's good to have you back, buddy.

1848
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:43,120
太好了 耶！
Yes. Yeah!

1849
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:44,250
呀！
Yay!

1850
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:45,520
好了 我们开始吧
All right, so we're doing it.

1851
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,220
谢谢这位领导 我们周五有个帮手了
Thanks to this S.H.I.T. head, we got a hearing set for Friday.

1852
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,360
别害怕 我撑着
Don't sweat it, kid. I'm all over it.

1853
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,170
好的，记住 本，这次很严肃，明白？
All right, please remember, Ben, this is serious, all right?

1854
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,400
要是失败了 我要去监狱
If this doesn't work, I'm going to prison.

1855
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,670
别担心，你还年轻 没什么
Oh, don't worry, you're young. Your butt can take it.

1856
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,840
你好，先生 我们来自南哈蒙
Hello, sir. Um, we're from South Harmon.

Okay, actually your meeting room's been changed to the Grand Hall.

1859
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,610
为什么？ 那边更宽敞
Why the change? It's bigger.

1860

我得做点事情
I had to do something.

1863
